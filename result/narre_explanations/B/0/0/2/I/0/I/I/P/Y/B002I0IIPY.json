{"reviews": ["My 8 and 10 year olds simply did not care for it .. not sure if it's a matter of them being too little for the game - on the other hand super mario galaxy is a very complicated game for that age level (in my opinion) and the kids were practically addicted to it and played it until they beat it - twice ! ... I guess they just found Sonic Colors boring in comparison..", "\"Here is my review for one of the best Sonic games I've played in a while. The game is \"\"Sonic COLORS\"\" on the Nintendo Wii; it is (to me) the best 3-D Sonic game I've ever played since \"\"Shadow The Hedgehog\"\" on the Gamecube. The plot is a little more complex for me to tell, so I won't bother explaining everything that happens unless you've played the game. -- That is what I would say if I was on a 24-hour alcohol binge with Steve Austin.As the highest rated Sonic game ever, this game still sucks just as much as every other game in the series -- no, it's worse than the others. This game has no variety in gameplay - you hold straight and jump on floating blocks. Yawnville. You want to play a good platformer? Play Rachet and Clank : A Crack In Time; or Mario Galaxy 3 -- Sonic Colors sucks. SEGA please put an end to this sad, pathetic series.Peacez.\"", "Sonic Colors is without a doubt a great game. It is a masterpiece which should receive a 10 in game review websites. People complain about the difficulty, I beat it in one night and I wasn't trying to either, it wasn't hard at all. Everything about the game is great and the wisp make the game so much more interesting. My only con about this game (which is nothin about the game), I think the level designs and way that the day levels in Sonic Unleashed were had a better feeling, but the levels in Sonic Colors are the best in any Sonic 3D Game.....even SA1 & 2......Huge and long time Sonic Fan", "I bought this for my son and he loves it. This game is way to fast for me, it is a blur with all of the colors and shapes dancing around I feel like I might go into a sezier but my five year old seems to love it. So I gave it a good rating.", "PRO'S:- Interesting plot choice (amusement park-themed levels)- Graphically soundCON'S:- Horrendous dialogue between Sonic and Tails (I have never found Sonic more annoying... it's a good thing people don't play these games for the storylines)- Nothing overly exciting about this game- Marketed as a 2-player game, when in fact, only a miniscule portion of the game can be played with a friendBottom line: What you see is what you get. You play as Sonic throughout 36 levels (plus boss battles) to foil Dr. Eggman's evil plans. Nothing new, nothing special. The game is good, just not great, and not one I'd recommend buying.I played this game, mastered the basics of it, and ended up beating it in about 10 hours. I could've gone back and gotten all 180 red star pieces (which are collectibles within the game), and was only 35 away from doing so, but I just can't motivate myself to completely finish it. So, for what it's worth, consider the fact that I played 10+ hours of this game to beat it, and only need maybe 3 or 4 more hours to get that accomplished feeling of beating everything in the game, but don't have the drive to pick up the controller again. To me, this is an indication that the game is fairly good first-time around, but has little replay value, which makes for a game that is just slightly above average. I don't know what it is, but there's nothing special about this game.", "\"I was SO STOKED when I read that an actual decent new Sonic game had been released, so I put it on my list of \"\"games to buy.\"\"  I'd watched a bunch of reviews on YouTube and the game looked absolutely beautiful and a blast to play.  Well, I have the game now...just got it.  So far I'm extremely disappointed, so much in fact that I've decided to go ahead and write this review now instead of wait until I finish the game (which, in all honesty may never happen because I'm so disinterested in playing it).  First off, the game is indeed beautiful and a pleasure to look at.  But.  That's where it stops for me.  Now I might be getting old, but to me the environments in this game are WAY TOO DETAILED...to the point of being very distracting.  Add to that the fact that Sonic often scales back SO FAR that I literally lose track of where he is on the screen he's so small (I play on a 26\"\" TV btw...not huge but not small, either).  Do you know how difficult it is to play a game when you keep losing track of where your character is onscreen?  It really breaks up any slight feeling of \"\"fun\"\" I might be having.  And then there are all the cutscenes.  God, spare me with the cutscenes.  If I wanted to watch a cartoon, I'd watch a frickin' cartoon.  I get that Sega's trying to appeal to little kids and/or create a storyline but come on--just let us play the d@mn game.  Spare us the filler.I dunno guys, I think I was duped.  Again.  Lets just face it: Sonic does NOT translate into 3D well.  How many DEAD HORSES is Sega going to unleash upon us while trying (unsuccessfully) to create a decent 3D Sonic game?  It didn't happen with the Saturn.  It didn't happen with the Dreamcast.  It didn't happen on the Gamecube.  And folks, it's not happening on the Wii.  WHEN WILL THEY GET IT THROUGH THEIR HEADS AND GO BACK TO 2D SIDE-SCROLLING GAMEPLAY!?!?!?!?!?  SEGA are you listening!?  We'll still buy your d@mn games if you go back to the original formula!  Look at the highest rated Sonic games in the past 15 years and guess what they are?  Sonic Gems and Sonic Mega Collection.  2-D!!!!  Proof that if you build it, WE WILL COME.  I've been hearing a lot of hype about the newly released Sonic Generations game, but it pains me to hear that game (surprise surprise) contains 3D gameplay in places.  At this point that makes me very reluctant to even give the game a shot.  Once bitten (more like one hundred times bitten with all these doozie 3D Sonic games), twice shy.  Please SEGA, get it together.  Look what Nintendo did: They released New Super Mario Bros Wii in classic 2D side-scrolling with updated graphics and that games sells like hotcakes.  Why don't you do the same!?  2D would even be easier for you to program, another reason you should be all about it.  So what's the hold up?  Enough with the 3D Sonic games...I beg of you.  ENOUGH.  Give us a game like Sonic CD only with updated Wii/PS3/XBox360 graphics.  It's that simple!  NOW DO IT.Edit: Okay, I actually forced myself to play this game to the end!  I wanted to see if maybe I was missing something??  It took me all of seven hours to complete, and I still stick by most of what I wrote above.  Sonic just doesn't work well in 3-D.  Some of the graphics were amazing, I liked some of the music as well.  The fun factor simply wasn't there for me.  I hated the levels where Sonic would automatically run and then you had to dodge all kind of crap, and then if you die you have to start WAY back at the beginning and do it all over again...that got old real fast.  As did the numerous false endings...how many false endings does a game need!?  My God there were three or four of them.  Meh, this puppy is going to a new home!!  I can't fathom ever playing it again, which I guess means the replay value is approximately zero.\"", "If you remember when Sonic was actually a great to play back in the day than you like Sonic Colors.  The graphics are very beautiful for the Wii system.  I did not notice to much slow down when I was playing.  This is good game to play.  If you are a Sonic fan and like playing good games then get this game.", "\"I've not finished this game 100%, but I did play enough to warrant a good review.  I've gone up to the ending of the game, but haven't collected all red rings, or obtained an S rating (the highest) in all the levels.But after playing this game, I'm totally looking forward to the future of Sonic.  I've played a few 3D Sonic games (Sonic Adventure, Sonic Heroes), but I grew up with Sonic by playing Sonic Chaos and Sonic Triple Trouble on the Game Gear, and played a lot of the Genesis titles found in the Sonic Mega Collection for the PS2.So I'm a big Sonic fan.After renting Sonic Unleashed, I found that, as with many gamers, I was looking forward to the day levels more than anything else.  Don't get me wrong: the night levels were fine, but it wasn't a Sonic game.  And Sonic isn't just about speed, but proper platforming.  The Game Gear games I used to play had me figuring out where the the end was, and how to get there the quickest.  There were a lot of puzzles than just getting to the end the fastest, and this is where Sonic Colors makes its debut.They take the best of the Genesis titles (proper puzzles, speed) and integrate them with the lush 3D environments.  Despite how abysmal previous Sonic games have been this century, they were amazingly great with the visuals, and this title is no exception.  It provides a great ideal of goin' fast, but also stops you to figure out the level design as in the days afore.The levels, however, re really short, and the game is overall brief.  Some levels seem more like bonus levels, and a few times I thought, \"\"That was it?  That was the whole level?!\"\"  Granted, there are about 6 acts in each world, but still.  (Super Mario Galaxy /2 has some short levels, but none as to-the-point as Sonic Colors).Now, for some gripes.CONSSome levels are too short, as mentioned before.  You get to the end real quick without even realizing it.  There are no cheap deaths, though, that I've encountered; so long as you pay attention to the environments, you really can't go wrong.The end does get pretty difficult, but that's a given.  The deeper you go into the game, the harder it should be.The controls aren't as tight as I'd like them.  They're fine for the game, but sometimes I wish the double-jump and wall-jump were utilized better.Confusing controls.  In some games you can't map the buttons, but they work fine.  In this game, however, I kept confusing the dash and slam buttons, which shouldn't happen.  I got used to them, but I should be able to switch 'em out.SUPER CHEESY dialog.  The story was a lot better than I thought it would, but there were times when I (a 24-year-old gamer) got a little embarrassed about the game I was playing.  Some may argue it's reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons--but I dunnah know....There were a lot of \"\"watch the game\"\" moments.  There should be a little signal showing when you're not actually playing, because by actually pressing buttons instead of letting the game take over, I would die.PROSExcellent Wisp implementation.  I'd love to see more, but the way this game used Wisps was very well done.  There were some that were a little difficult to pull off (laser), but they were fine in general.SPEED!  Sonic is REALLY fast!  I miss the rolling dash move (hear me, Sega?), but the homing attack is very useful.  The environments greatly pave a way for super-fast Sonic, and when he stops, it smoothly transitions me into figuring out the stage design.Despite the short levels and extremely easy bosses, the final boss makes up for it (no spoiler).Also, despite my complaint about mapping buttons, you can use a wide array of controllers at your disposal: the Wii Remote sideways, the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo, the GameCube controller, and--my personal favorite--the Classic Controller /Pro.The game is a necessary part of your Wii library.  It's no Super Mario Galaxies, but the fact that people are even mentioning such an astronomical title (pun intended) with Sonic Colors just shows how much the game has to offer.  I don't recommend it for the younger crowd as it can be a bit frustrating and difficult, but for gamers in general and those skeptical about the Sonic franchise, I'd say without hesitation that Sonic is back.  It's not the greatest game the Wii has to offer, but it's definitely the right foundation for the future of Sonic.Here's hoping the blue blur shows his stuff in later installments.tl;dr version:PROS:- great visuals- amazing Wisp implementation- very fast- no cheap deaths if you pay attention to the environmentCONS:- somewhat clunky controls- super cheesy dialog- short- easy bosses (at first)A great and necessary addition to your Wii library, and aptly paves the road for the future of 3D Sonic.\"", "\"Poor Sonic. Where have you gone? You were shining extremely bright in the 90s. Then, in the 2000s, (almost) everything fell flat in the middle of that decade. We see a human girl smooching off Sonic to give him Chaos Emerald power, a giant fat cat that everybody hates, and entire games in which a hedgehog wields a gun or a sword. Sonic was practically dying all this time. Luckily for the famous blue hedgehog, the 2010s are bringing him back to the spotlight with Sonic Colors!Sonic Colors is a step in the right direction. It is complete with 2.5D-3D gameplay, (mostly) funny cutscenes, and gimmicks that actually work correctly. Those gimmicks are the aliens known as \"\"Wisps\"\". The Wisps serve as power-ups, something that was never featured in pretty much any of the Sonic games (Unless you count shields and Chaos Emeralds)The graphics are mind-blowing. It's Sega's creativity at its finest! Everything looks pretty darn flashy and colorfully (no pun intended) detailed. Simply put: It's eye candy. The environments are crazy, too, for the most part. Sometimes, I'd just think \"\"How could they have pulled it off so neatly?\"\"The gameplay varies from 2.5D to 3D segments. You would probably think that it would fall flat as it did in other Sonic games. Fortunately, however, it manages to be a fun result. This is what we were all begging for from Sega: A good modern Sonic game that has very appealing gameplay. Plus, it doesn't all rely on speed. There are lots and lots of platforming to do....and I had a blast playing through. Sorry, 360 and PS3 fans...you kinda missed out.Lastly: The cutscenes. Is the dialogue bad like in some of the other Sonic games? No! In fact, there were some pretty good jokes in the cutscenes (Although few are moan-inducing). Some happen to be pretty random, such as how Yacker (the first Wisp Sonic befriends) identifies Dr. Eggman as Baldy McNoseHair. As random as it was, I cracked up.Overall, if you think Sonic is seriously going downhill, you should pick this up. It will change your mind about the series's downfall, and you're gonna love it. While we Wii owners won't be able to get Sonic Generations (Though it'll come on Nintendo 3DS), at least we still have a Sonic game that lets us forget about the blue hedgehog's troubling past.\"", "\"Don't let the negative reviews steer you away, you need to judge this one on your own. There'll always be a critic, this is a damn good game. It's not the longest sonic game around, but it's really fun and really gorgeous. Don't let the \"\"not-so-good\"\" gamers tell you this game is frustrating. Alot of people get thrown off cuz this is a sonic game that requires patience at certain points, like any good game. Some people just want a race to the finish line. Don't be narrow minded, the key to getting passed obstacles is slowing down. After you get good enough, you can pull it off at high speeds. Voice acting is way better than other sonic games and filled with comedy. Sonic fans are gonna have a blast with this.\"", "Let me tell you that people make Sonic Unleashed for the Xbox 360. The controls on the unleashed is horrible. Also Unleashed teased my brother saying that the boost is faster than Sonic Generations. But this Game has better controls. Buyer beware to Sonic Unleashed. Buy Sonic Colors. It has better controls than I thought.", "\"IfSonic Unleashedprovided a blueprint-like glimpse at how great Modern Sonic could be, andSonic Generationswas the truly finalized entry delivering on that promise, then Sonic Colors is in the middle, acting as the first prototype to employ the concept well. What that means in retrospect is that when you play this game, you're getting an experience much better overall than Unleashed's half-n-half dual quality, but not quite as refined and perfected as Sonic Generations' iteration of Modern Sonic. That been said, it's more than worth the price of admission. Indeed, this is the first Sonic game sinceSonic Adventure 2that I personally consider a \"\"great\"\" Sonic title. That says a lot, I think.The story in Colors goes like this: Eggman (or as I prefer to call him, Dr. Robotnik) evidently grows a conscience and in an apparent act of repentance, builds a massive inter-galactic amusement park for everyone to enjoy. Of course, Sonic and Tails are more than a little suspicious and investigate. Of course, they find out the good ol' doctor is indeed up to no good, chaining and enslaving the planets connected to his park in order to gain the energy of their alien citizens called Wisps. The Wisps respond to Sonic's heroics by giving him their energy, enhancing his abilities throughout his adventure. It is very silly and lighthearted in comparison to some of Sonic's most recent outings, but is actually much better for it.The art design and graphical execution in this game is excellent. It's incredibly flashy, colorful, and creative. One level is a massive space fleet meets carnival with a vibrant holographic pathway for Sonic to sprint across. Another is a beautiful, alien world being deforested by Robotnik's forces. Another is a thrilling space elevator. Those are just some examples of what the level themes of this game contains. The imagination is through the roof in this game, and the graphics really deliver. Despite the Wii's limitations, this game delivers excellently on the promise. This is one of the prettier games on the system.The sound design is just as cool as the visuals. Of course, the traditional sound effects are all here, no surprise there. The music is absolutely fantastic, the best Sonic has seen in years. There's also a surprising amount of music here too. A lot of work went into the soundtrack, and it shows. Plant Wisp is my favorite. Awesome stuff. Also worth noting is the voice acting present. This was the first game the new voice actors made an appearance in, and they do a very good job delivering their lines. Not only that, but the writing is decent too, offering a very lighthearted scrip with a lot of humor.The gameplay in Colors is everything that you'd ever want or expect from a Sonic title. For the first time in years, this game delivered a non-stop Sonic experience. No distractingly boring characters like Big the Cat, Amy, or even Sonic... the Warehog, taking up time with boring, slow, and cumbersome gameplay mechanics. It seems with Colors that Sonic Team finally learned that Sonic games don't need adding unnecessary, annoying elements/concepts/characters for the sake of injecting variety that nobody wanted or asked for. No, all anyone wants from a Sonic title is being the fastest thing alive, navigating a massive obstacle course of loop-de-loops, springs, turns, and speed boosts in their own flashy playground. Colors has all of these things in spades, both in 2-D and 3-D, non-stop. There's a boost function that makes Sonic run so fast the outside music and sound distorts. Now that's fast, and exactly what anyone would want from a Sonic title. Epic set pieces are frequent, emulating that \"\"holy crap!\"\" feeling of the killer whale chase ofSonic Adventureand the death truck chase ofSonic Adventure 2. Boss fights are long, engaging, and are as speedy as the rest of the game. Great job Sonic Team! See how simple that was?The newest addition to the gameplay is in the form of performance enhancing wisps combining their power with Sonic when he frees them. Some turn him into a beam of light, shooting like lightning and bouncing off of surfaces at angled trajectories. Others turn him into a pink spike ball that speed along walls and ceilings. Others turn him into a blimp that floats for a limited time. These wisps are awesome additions to the traditional Sonic gameplay, and add variety to the experience without taking away from the speed-focused platforming that makes the game so enjoyable.So is there anything not too great about Sonic Colors? Well yeah, there are some problems. For instance, there are difficulty spikes at really random times and when it does it spikes hard, to the point where you'll want to chuck the controller across the room. It's really frustrating, and you can't progress until finishing these parts. The game is also a bit short for my taste. There are incentives for replaying, but it's not as extensive as Generations' offerings. Too bad. Also, while the gameplay and control mechanics are quite good, you can tell that Sonic Team was still trying to get the hang of how Modern Sonic should control. After playing the perfectedSonic Generations, it's pretty evident that they were still working on how everything should work. The game is still a blast to play and it controls well even still, but it's still worth noting.Overall though, Sonic Colors is the first genuinely high-quality console Sonic title to come out in years. If you haven't played this stellar platforming game yet, I'd highly recommend it. If you're hesitant because of the poor reputation of Sonic console games of the past 7 years or so, while I totally understand the trepidation, I'd suggest you reconsider. If you give Sonic Colors a chance, you'll be treated to a very fun, very true-to-form Sonic title that sticks to the simple yet timelessly fun philosophy behind Sonic the Hedgehog: Being the fastest thing alive. Buy it, speed'n'dash through it, and enjoy playing through your very own intergalactic amusement park.\"", "\"Sonic Colors is an outer worldly experience featuring gamer's favorite blue hedgehog as he and Tails attempt to foil whatever nefarious plot Eggman has up his sleeve. Arriving via an Earth to space elevator at Eggman's space amusement park, Sonic rushes in to save a wisp, this games powerups as well as the beings in need of saving. What is Eggman planning with them and can Sonic save them? Well you have to dive in to find out, as I wont spoil the plot.From the start, the game throws one in and through \"\"?\"\" on the levels, introduces players to the controls (if they so wish).  The game features numerous control schemes including the gamecube controller. I used Wiimote + Nunchuk for the sake of playing with any Wiimote shaking and movement they threw in (which is shaking the Wiimote to use any powerup).  The shaking never gets too onerous unless one has to constantly activate a powerup, but that is only in the sake of collecting every red coin on a level.  There are about 180 of these red coins scattered throughout the games stages (6 in each act) that when collected will unlock something special! There is no \"\"true\"\" ending so one does not need to collect them all. A player is also awarded a rank for finishing a stage, though once again, getting the highest rank isnt required for something special. Player times can also be shared via leaderboard online. The powerups are creative and useful for getting through stages, as many stages have special routes, so playing and returning to stages once more wisps powers are unlocked are vital. An example of a wisp power is a rocket that can be used to transform Sonic into a rocket and he can blast off high into the air then hover downwards.Worlds are pretty colorful and varied, one is a mountain of sweets, another is a tropical resort, and another is a carnival type theme. There are more, but once again I wont spoil them. Ultimately, theres enough variety that players should be able to not get too tired of playing the same type and there are just enough to also easily have favorites. Some of the levels are a bit mindblowing, such as the carnival one makes the level materialize right in front of Sonic, while others have numerous spirals, loops and rails to slide on...theres even a rollercoaster!The game looks great for a Wii game, colorful, bright, and occasionally interesting lighting effects and particle effects. The graphics are so good that one has to truly play it on a big screen to take all the color and such in. It would have been interesting to see this game in HD, if they had made it. Cutscenes look great too, the voice acting was believable and great (some purposefully cheesy but hilarious lines too), and the musical selections were awesome.  The themes for the intro (Reach for the Stars) is fitting and is always great to sit through when booting the game up. The ending theme too is memorable and fitting. The soundtrack was good and perhaps SEGA knew this as they did release the soundtrack on iTunes immediately after the game came out.Ultimately, if one is looking for THE Sonic game to play, Sonic Colors is the one. With no drastically \"\"night and day\"\" difference in gameplay, it is just Sonic in a pure form speeding through levels and saving the helpless, essentially, doing that which he does best. Truly check it out and \"\"reach for the stars!\"\"*Local multiplayer was not played, though it is in the game, separate multiplayer stages*\"", "\"After first hearing about Sonic's new game for the holiday season of 2010, I was not immediately impressed by it. After receiving Sonic Unleashed earlier that year, I thought this game would be just as the concept in Unleashed. However, buying the game and actually playing it would prove me wrong.The main story in this game takes place in Dr. Eggman's space amusement park. Eggman claims this amusement park to be built from a sense of remorse for his past misdeeds. However, Sonic knows better than to trust what Dr. Eggman says. As a result, he and his friend Tails investigate the space amusement park and discover that Eggman is trying to take control of aliens called Whisps. From then on, your job is to save the Whisps.Gameplay, I have to admit, is very fun and very replayable. To add to this fact, you can use a total of four different controller types: Wiimote with Nunchuk, Wiimote alone, Gamecube Controller, and Classic Controller. Whichever controller you choose, you still play Sonic Colors with the same type of concept.Sonic is the only playable character in this game. One of the first things I noticed was the fact that he had a double jump--something that I've only seen him with in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. To add to this, he has a boost gauge that can be filled up by collecting white whisps. This boost gauge, however, must be used carefully so that you don't run out of boost energy or send yourself flying to your death.Main gameplay aside, let's talk about the whisps. There are eight types of whisps. White whisps fill up your boost gauge, blue whisps can turn Sonic into a lazer, yellow whisps turn him into a drill that can dig underground, green whisps let him hover and perform the light-speed dash, pink whisps turn him into a spiky ball that can grip onto any surface and perform the spin dash, purple whisps turn him into a ravenous creature that destroys anything in its path, and orange whisps turn him into a rocket that lets him blast off into the sky. These whisps are the main gimics of Sonic Colors--and can help you to acheive medals which you can use in the \"\"Sonic Simulator\"\".The Sonic Simulator is a part of the game where you and a friend can make your way to the goal ring at the end. However, I prefer doing this alone--as doing it with a friend often results in many deaths. The reason for these deaths result in the fact that if you leave your friend behind or if you simply jump on them while they're already trying to jump to a platform, they will die. However, Sonic Simulator gives you the chance to gain the chaos emeralds and become Super Sonic in regular stages.Sonic Colors is a fantastic game--and it should be in every Sonic fan's library. Even non-Sonic fans will enjoy this for its classic storyline, multiple gimics, and intense platforming.\""], "A": [0.12710341811180115, 0.006337747909128666, 0.03897169604897499, 0.36596113443374634, 0.012613413855433464, 0.12899646162986755, 0.08073572814464569, 0.002042768755927682, 0.007911710068583488, 6.068154561944539e-06, 0.21881268918514252, 0.010500194504857063, 1.4382509405663768e-08, 6.9192856244626455e-06]}
