{"reviews": ["This game to me looks overall better than the PS2 original that I was planning to buy, thank goodness I chose to wait for this game. controls are fine and responsive and the action is pretty good. I totally recommend this game to any 3DS owner over 17 years old", "I feel that I should review this game as another entry in the 3DS library as most people reading this are probably thinking about adding it to their collections. In that regard Metal Gear Solid 3 is a well produced game and worthy of praise. However, it would be foolish to ignore the fact that there are many versions of this game on the market and if you have multiple game systems, this may not be the best option for you. I think the fairest approach is if you want Metal Gear on the go or a taste for more grown-up games on the 3DS, go ahead and get this if you do not own any other gaming system.The visuals are quite nice but I think that some people are stretching it when they claim this version of the game looks better than the HD versions. The 3D effect is very pleasing to look at but when the effect is turned off I do not think it looks better than the HD collections.If you play this game I suggest getting the Circle Pad Pro. It is very comfortable to hold and the second analog stick is much better than using the 3DS buttons to move the game's camera around. The game can be played without that add-on if you really don't want to buy that thing but it does help. Just remember to go into your options screen and set it to detect the circle pad. The developers added a few instances of motion control. One example will be early in the game when Snake is on a tree limb and you have to tilt your system to the right and left in order to keep your balance. This is very much like the same gimmick on Uncharted: Golden Abyss and I do not care for it here either.However, using the touch screen to access your inventory is awesome. You may need a little time to get used to it but it is a breeze to change weapons and items.I do not wish to spoil the story but there is certainly a lot of it here and the voices are very well done. In fact, the game talks a little too much but you can use a fast-forward button on the touchscreen to speed through dialogue if you want to.The only thing that keeps me from proudly recommending this game is the fact that the competing system is going to get the Metal Gear Trilogy collection (including this game) for about the same price. While the 3D effect is nice, it does not beat getting two additional games. If you have a 3DS and no plans to get the Vita then go ahead and buy this version. It is worth playing. However, if you have both systems then I would encourage you to consider the upcoming collection for the Vita.", "i thought it could have been educational, maybe metallic gears, something to do with engineering or physics(someone told me this game had a good engine)nope, no snakes either. i have a pet toad but it ran away.anyways turns out this was quite a fun game. you get to punch a croc and shoot bee hives with your pistol.you slash up the croc for some meat which fills up your health.quite gruesome, but fun. then i got shot to death by neverending soldiers. so i didnt get past the first area.", "Okay so Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is probably the best game in the MGS series, even better than Twin Snakes.  So why is this port just okay?Well the first problem with Metal Gear Solid 3D: Snake Eater is unless you have one of those silly Circle Pad Pros, the controls are unwieldy.  They use the D pad to do what the face buttons should be doing.  Which is awkward and too bad because this game is actually modeled after Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence, not Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater.  In Snake Eater (and also Sons of Liberty) you don't really need a second analog stick.  Those games are practically top down and control very much like Metal Gear Solid did on the first PlayStation.  If Konami had remade Snake Eater for the 3DS instead of Subsistence we wouldn't have needed the Circle Pad Pro at all.  Who knows, they may have even been able to lock down the choppy frame rate in this version of MGS3.  Which is the other problem with this 3DS port.  Talk about a missed opportunity.Those are two pretty big things holding this game back but it's still the same content with a few new Easter eggs thrown in and a create your own camouflage mode using the 3DS camera that I found to be an extremely fun and addictive feature.", "This review's probably gonna be short, because I never played a Metal Gear game before this (With the exception of the NES version of the original MG). When I heard about this game coming for 3DS, it was actually quite a promising thought. I never would've imagined Snake returning to Nintendo systems, really, after Metal Gear Solid for Game Boy Color (Which is a tempting purchase). But after trying this out, I'm starting to wonder why I missed out on this series.The game is all about stealth, something that not many games follow. Sure, you are equipped with a gun that can kill a soldier, but if you are spotted by one, a whole bunch will bunch and go kill you (Fortunately, you could still be able to hide somewhere)! It's frustrating at first glance, but it's actually pretty interesting and fun. It also makes for some nice strategy, as you gotta plan your way through certain situations.Along with the cool gameplay, the largely detailed graphics (especially in 3D), awesome soundtrack, and exciting presentation all around make for a fabulous package. And to top it all off, it has a very dramatic and gripping storyline. In fact, the stealth and everything makes it seem like as if you were really involved within it.If this review isn't enough to convince you to go buy this game, try out a demo of this game by going onto the Nintendo eShop and download it. The download may take a while, but it'll all be worth it once you play it. And for a much bigger experience, buy this game.", "it doesnt feel clunky at all, and with the circle pad its great. its like 3D MGS3, how can you go wrong? there are little technical aspects you can nitpick about, but none of them hamper gameplay.", "\"Snake Eater.  The third Metal Gear Solid game originally debuted on the Playstation 2 in 2004, with an updated Subsistence version that came around a year later.  The game won high praise, particularly for its characters and storytelling.  It has seen numerous releases at this point.  The original, the subsistence release, the essential collection and the recent HD collection.  With the 3DS, this marks the fifth time players could potentially jump in.  How does it stack up on the 3DS and is it worth the buy (especially for those who have the HD collection)?It would take a little too much time to talk about the plot of the Metal Gear Solid saga.  The third one in particular takes place before all the other games in the series and mainly focuses on \"\"Naked Snake.\"\"  An operative sent into USSR to rescue a scientist known as Sokolov from the clutches of a brutal man named Volgin.  He is aided by a few allies, including Major Tom, his mentor \"\"The Boss\"\" and paramedic.  When the mission to save Sokolov ends in failure and betrayal, Snake is sent back into the jungles to stop Volgin once again, as well as to wipe out a special faction known as \"\"The Cobra Unit\"\" (hence, \"\"Snake Eater\"\").  On paper the plot is fairly simplistic, but Metal Gear Solid 3 has quite a good story filled to the brim with incredible characters and moments that'll really tug at your heart strings.  It is nowhere near as complex (or as convoluted) as the plots for Metal Gear Solid 2 or Metal Gear Solid 4... and that's probably why the story in this one works so well.  It's a simpler story but still has its moments and twists that'll blow you away.  But thanks to the emotional attachment we can make to these characters and the environment we're placed in, there is so much more than just an intricate plot at hand.  This alone has caused a great deal of fans to label Metal Gear Solid 3 the best in the franchise (myself included).  It just has the most encompassing story.  That's not to say there won't be cut scenes that drag... but there certainly aren't nearly as many.  And best of all, it's perfectly fine to start with Snake Eater as your first Metal Gear Solid game because it predates the rest of the story.  It might even serve as a decent introduction for those who haven't played the series before.Although, it should be known that the gameplay to Metal Gear Solid 3 is complex.  The original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2 had you using a radar as you snuck around avoiding the enemy.  Here, you use camouflage to blend into your environment, with a camo index showing you how well you blend in.  The higher the index the more hidden you are.  You'd think this would make Metal Gear Solid 3 a difficult game, but the game is hardly difficult at all.  Keeping yourself hidden is simpler than it looks.  If anything the downside is that you may find yourself in the menu often to change camo.  In fact, if you get your index high enough, enemies could be standing nearly on top of you before they realize something is awry.On the other hand, the new controls on the 3DS will take time to get adjusted to.  This is especially true if you're used to the consoles.  You can easily aim and shoot in first person, but the lack of a second analog stick makes camera control feel awkward at first.  Instead you control the camera by using the face buttons while you use the d-pad and touch screen to change items.  At first this control scheme is going to be awkward.  If ever there was a reason to buy that Circle Pad Pro, this would probably be it.  It takes time to get used to, and you can't help but admit that playing the game using an actual controller is just all around better.  The game compensates, but it doesn't separate from the fact that the controls are clunky.The 3D itself is fairly good, however.  In fact, it may be some of the best 3D to date on the system.  You'll certainly be immersed in the world here.  This is especially apparent when you're crawling through grass in first person.  Of course, because the game was originally not in stereoscopic 3D to begin with, you won't really find yourself in dire of need of using it.  But at least it doesn't detract from the experience.  However, it does do one of the things that 3D CAN be good for in a game... it has made the game world itself more immersive.  It doesn't impact gameplay, but it certainly enhances the aesthetic experience of Metal Gear Solid 3.  .  The game was already impressive looking on the Playstation 2, and it continues to be impressive looking here.  The 3D just happens to add an extra layer onto that.  It most certainly shows that some games can be converted to 3D (that aren't made by Nintendo) and done well.On the other hand, the gyro controls most certainly could've been done without.  Having to tilt or move the 3DS while crossing a bridge or being on a tree trunk just feels awkward.  Especially because you don't have to go across surfaces where you balance yourself that often to begin with.  It's more a distraction than an actual additional feature.  And if you intend to play with the 3D on then the gyro controls really don't add to the experience.  They're more likely to take away from it.But, of course, there is the big elephant in the room.  Metal Gear Solid 3 has had SEVERAL releases.  The HD Collection just came out a couple of months before this release.  And if you got your hands on that, is there really a need to pick up this one?  It really depends on if you want MGS3 on the go and if the 3D alone will make you want it.  The game isn't bad but the 3DS isn't the best way to enjoy it.  Especially because it lacks so many features the console version has.  It's impressive to see the game done on a handheld, but the controls aren't good enough and all the extras you got before with the HD Collection or Subsistence simply aren't here.  Even worse, the HD Collection comes at the same price.As great as Metal Gear Solid 3 is, nearly every version released before the 3DS version is superior.  Not only are the controls better, but all the extras are included in full.  The 3D effects in the game are brilliant and the story remains untouched, but one thing is simple: Metal Gear Solid 3 simply worked better on the console.  It's an impressive feat that the full game--cutscenes and all--is on a handheld, but with better versions coming either cheaper or roughly the same price it's a wonder if the 3D alone can really salvage the package.\"", "hard to work controls at first but a good time spender", "This metal gear is like PS2s part 3 snake eater but this is in 3D and you shoot yoshi instead of frogs so this is like every 3DS owners dream who likes metal gear"], "A": [0.34513789415359497, 0.0019353668903931975, 0.3808012008666992, 0.004235611762851477, 0.00439745606854558, 0.0001643749128561467, 0.05989351496100426, 0.18294183909893036, 0.02049264870584011]}
