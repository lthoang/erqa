{"reviews": ["\"I am a longtime fan of all Dove products and was interested to see that they are entering the growing men's product market with a bang. Dove soap really continues to be the main soap recommended by dermatologists and with good reason. It doesn't dry up your skin like desert sand the way most soap can.This is a strongly scented bar of soap with the trademarked \"\"one quarter moisturizing lotion\"\" slogan that has proven to be such a winner. It's a scent that leaves no question in your mind that this is a manly smelling soap bar. It's pretty overpowering, even while still in the package. However I can say that mercifully, the scent gradually fades out after a few days of being exposed to the air. I think that they have most likely done marketing studies with this soap that show that men react favorably to this scent, while for women, it is like being hit over the head with a brick of musk.Scent aside, the Dove high quality is firmly in place. This silky attractive bar is soft and kind to my skin, while the abrasive crystal embedded in it are actually very pleasant to use. It feels pretty good to rub this over my skin, and it does a gentle job of exfoliating. I tried this on the sensitive skin on my face, and had no adverse reaction to it. In fact, it made my skin soft and smooth and glowing.If not for that super strong initial scent, this would have easily gotten five stars from me. But they needed a way to announce to men in no uncertain terms that this is a man's soap, something no woman would ever choose for herself, and the scent calls out across the room that message brilliantly.edit: Once this is out of the box for a few days the scent dies down into something very lovely. I give this soap five well deserved stars.\"", "Make no mistake, this is NOT your typical, lotion-y Dove product.Yes, there's the Dove lotion ingredient, but you're not overwhelmed by the amount of oily residue that sometimes happen when you use Dove's product.The upside is, of course, that you face doesn't feel dried out.  That's especially true here.  My face feels clean but it also feels somewhat smooth, but not dirty or sweaty smooth.A good product and the fragrance is very mild, yet masculine.Great product.", "This is a great little soap. It is gentle enough to use on the face as it contains both moisturizing cream and mild exfoliants. As it is marketed to men,it has a strong woodsy/green aroma. I personally prefer the freshness one finds in most men's fragrances. I liked this one but  less is more. Although the scent dissipates somewhat, it is still quite noticeable. Therefore, I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.My experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes.", "\"This soap has the \"\"micro-beads\"\" similar to exfoliating face washes, etc.  When used with a washcloth, you won't notice them all that much, but used straight on the skin, you'll definitely get a good scrubbing from it.  It does have a lot of moisturizers in it, too, which I can seem to tell a difference given that it's the winter and we have really hard water.  My skin feels good afterward and doesn't have the dry itch from lesser normal soaps.\"", "\"I make my own lotions and I created one with a masculine scent, so I wanted a masculine smelling soap to go with it. The scent of this is okay, not as nice as other versions of Dove I have tried. It has exfoliating flakes that are pretty large. They are much more prominent in this soap than the blue boxed exfoliating \"\"skin peeling\"\" German version of Dove that I have tried (you can buy that version on Amazon or at International Markets). The shape of this bar is different than traditional Dove bars and also fits better into a mesh soap saver mitt. I tend to scrub myself head to toe a few times in the shower and this did not leave my skin dry, even though I shower twice a day. The bar felt great on my face and the exfoliating flakes helped lift off some powdery, dry looking skin that was bothering me.I have tried other men's soaps and they are usually terrible smelling and dry my skin so badly it itches. This one was not drying at all, lathered really nice and had a perfect amount of scrubbing flakes. I took one star off for the scent, which I was a little disappointed with.\"", "I like Dove products so I decided to get this new Dove soap for my boyfriend and I to use at his house. I got the Deep Clean scent, which smells great. Basically it smells clean like real soap. Neither feminine nor manly. Nice neutral smell. It is a gentle soap that is moisturizing too (helps dry skin), but it still rinses clean.It has some little scrubby granules in it - I don't care for scrubbies in bar soap because I think they only work if you rub the actual bar on your body. I usually put the soap on a washcloth or loofah.", "For me this is perfection. No other soap that I've used does what this does. It makes me feel as if I don't have oily skin. Also, the scent - wow. And it looks like it has some fine sand in it but nothing like that is listed as an ingredient.The scent is good but kind of vanity-inspiring in the Dorian Gray sense. I actually keep the bathroom door closed to get the room infused with the scent. Now that I'm used to it, I'm Dove's loyal customer for this product.I love this soap - best soap I ever had and the scent beats everything I ever had. Got it in my Wish List and will grab it again and again.", "I can't fault the performance of this bar soap. It lathers well, rinses clean and has enough moisturizer in it that keeps my skin from feeling dry but still feeling clean. I also like that it's available as a bar soap. While liquid soaps are nice, a traditional bar soap is still my favorite since they seem to last longer (and thus be more economical) than liquid soaps.My quibble is with the scent. Not a big fan of it. I would love it if it came as an unscented version, as the scent is a bit too strong for my preference. It's not a huge negative, but it's troublesome enough that I have to mark it down a star for that.", "Dove for men is a great dual soap.  I love that I can wash my face and body with one product.  It lathers well and leaves me feeling clean without any residue or tight skin feeling.  It has a mild scent, which I find pleasing.My one complaint is I seem to go through it rather quickly.  I go through it faster than an other bar soap I have ever used.  And that is another drawback, it is bar soap.  I like the convenience of a liquid soap, but its lather and clean feeling negate that one drawback.I would recommend dove for men.", "My husband is the one that is using this product, so I'll share what he has to say.  He says that the bar has a very nice scent that is not overpowering.  He feels like it gets all the dirt off and leaves his skin feeling clean without drying it out.  He also uses the soap to clean his face and he has not had any breakouts.  He is an electrician and is outside most days in every weather condition, so his skin is consistently exposed to dirt, etc.  He would recommend this product to others.", "\"I bought my husband the body wash, deodorant and the bar soap to try and he loves them all. He wont use anything else. They smell nice too. Not too strong but a good \"\"man\"\" smell :)\"", "Although I'm not much of a bar soap kind of guy, when this came up on Vine I thought I'd give it a try.  As others have noted, the lather is rich and nice that washes off easily.  There is no detectable residue left after washing off and the scent is fantastic.I use this mainly on my face and it does a wonderful job with the cleaning beads.", "My husband immediately took to this soap.  He loved the strong scent, which I&#8217;m not partial too, and loved how it felt coming out of the shower.  I suspect that&#8217;s from the exfoliating granules in this bar, something that is usually found in women&#8217;s soaps.  In fact, he really is enjoying Dove products from the body washes, to the shampoos, and now the bar soap.  I&#8217;m actually a bit surprised because he can be somewhat &#8220;brand loyal,&#8221; but everyone likes what they like.  He is also using lotions so it&#8217;s hard to say weather or not this soap is acting as a moisturizer.  He definitely is giving the Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean a thumbs up.INGREDIENTS:Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate or Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine or Sodium C14-C16 Olefin Sulfonate, Sodium Cocoate or Sodium Palm Kernelate, Fragrance, Microcrystalline Wax, Sodium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Green 5, Iron Oxides, Red 30 Lake, Titanium Dioxide, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6.DOVE BODY BARS:Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Extra FreshDove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Aqua ImpactDove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean", "I gave this to my husband to use in the shower...after a week- the bar is good sized, my husband states he feels clean and his skin is soft...he also added that he likes it does not have a heavy scent", "\"The second shower product I have used in the Dove Men + Care line is this Body and Face Bar. The first was theDove Men Plus Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 13.5 Ouncethat I liked very much for use on my face but less for the rest of my body. I like the bar soap for cleansing and moisturizing the body below the neck. The moisturizing cream in the bar prevents dry skin, especially on the front of my legs. I am a runner, and my legs get very dry in the cold winter weather. The bar has moisturizer, but it also has cleansing \"\"grains\"\" small gray particles embedded throughout the bar that scrub away sweat and dirt. I like the fact that the bar soap rinses off cleanly without the soap residue that is left by many liquid body wash products. It has a good clean pine-like scent. So, I strongly recommend the Fresh Awake Body and Face Wash for face and neck and the Body + Face Bar for the rest of the body.\"", "This stuff smells fantastic. The scent is clean and masculine but not over powering.  I liked the scent so much that I will keep buying these for the guys in my house. My son really liked the scent as well. This is a very rich and moisturizing soap. But it is also effective on odors- even pervasive ones. We farm and a lot of of the animal smells do not wash off with lesser soaps. My son has found this product is too moisturizing for his face. But it is a great product.", "That is the first thing that I check is the smell when I open the package and this smelled very nice.  Now the second thing I check for is how well it lathers with a wash cloth which this one does very nicely to.I really like these new products that are coming out that are related to mens needs. Ex. Dove, Axe, etc...Would definately buy!", "Dove Men Care Body and Face Bar is a really good bar soap with exfoliating grains built in.  The fragrance is definitely for men - the same woodsy fragrance that a lot of this line has.  My husband loves the fragrance while I am a little more so so about it.  He finds the exfoliating part of the soap to be a huge plus.  I have sensitive skin, so I used the soap only on my hands rather than directly on the rest of me.  It is not a drying soap and it rinses off with a clean feel rather than the slightly oily feel that some moisturizing soaps have a tendency towards.I really like the idea of a nice bar soap for men with some moisturizer built in, especially during the winter months when heaters have a tendency to dry the skin out.", "This bar smells good with a nice but not overwhelming manly fragrance. Lathers well and doesn't leave any type of film. Rinses well. So, why the one star deduction? The exfoliating grains are too present to be comfortable but sparse enough not to be effective. They felt incidental and somewhat annoying. Aside from that...which is obviously a personal preference...the form of the bar is nice, the lather, rinse and lack of soapy after-film all excellent.", "My husband is extremely particular with smells.  He has move soap products than I do.  I noticed that as the winter months have worn on, his skin was getting a little flaky.  I know that exfoliation isn't something he pays a lot of attention to, but I wanted his skin to look smooth and prevent any ingrown hairs.  This bar is the perfect solution.  It has the little bumps within it to get rid of dead skin cells and smells like a man instead of traditional Dove products.  He is pleased with the scent and the fact that he is getting less red bumps along his chin line.  I've noticed that his skin looks moisturized even though I can not get him to use lotion.  We've both been very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone.", "\"8 bars for around $9 isn't a bad deal at all. This soap smells pretty good, it's a masculine smell and it doesn't leave any residue behind or that \"\"dry\"\" feeling. I used to use Irish Spring but am tempted to switch over to this after trying it out.\"", "\"In recent years I gave up on some of the body and face bars for me on the market. The problem was the aroma. They were either too strong and lingered all day like decaying chicken in a garbage can, or they were so light in aroma that you wondered why bother spending the money? And some of them basically were jazzed up soap with a slightly upgraded aroma. Dove gets it just right here. There is a wonderful pleasing aroma that you don't need a special machine to detect, but it's not so strong that when you walk by someone says, \"\"I know that smell anywhere!\"\" It's a very pleasing aroma that will fit in well with someone who may use some cologne, or doesn't, or someone who uses a strong deodorant or doesn't. Also: when you use it you feel you've had a deep clean, yet it leaves the skin feeling wonderful. A test for me is always using it on my face. I rotate my shampoos and some give me allergies after a while. Sometimes a soap will  leave my face red. Not this one. There was zero bad reaction (only a cleaner face that felt nice and probably had an aroma but no so much that someone would say , 'I know that face smell anywhere!\"\" But I have to say: I LIKE its pleasing aroma which is just enough but not overpowering. This is a soap you'll order again.\"", "Update: After using this for a few months, I must say I like it a lot more. The fragrance is sweet smelling and cleans well.--------------------------Has purifying grains. I thought I could feel them like grains in facial scrubs but actually they're too small to feel, but you can feel them when you lather up.Can be used for both body and face with 1/2 moisturizing cream. Is actually a good soap. It cleans and rinses nicely but dries without leaving the skin tight. So I would recommend this because it has two things which I feel are the most important in soap, cleaning well and not leaving the skin dry.", "All in all, this is a pretty good soap.  It's got some moisturizing lotion but not too much, it lathers up well, and it has scrubbing fibers that leave you feeling exfoliated and extra clean.  The relatively small four ounce size feels good and works well.  It has a strong fragrance when lathered - like a woody, musky cologne - and leaves a slight fragrance on the skin when you're done showering.  The only caveat is that if you share your shower with someone who doesn't like that masculine of a scent, you will need his and hers bars.All in all, I thought it was pretty good.  It cleans well and smells good, and I'm not sure what else I can reasonably expect from soap.", "There is something special about Dove Men + soap. With other types of soap (e.g. Dial, Irish Spring), you are left with a soap residue feeling on your skin after use. Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar is great for use with your body or face. Even if you have skin problems such as acne, this soap is great for washing away body oil and leaving your face and skin smooth and clean without the irritation. What I really like about this particular Dove product is the microbeads. These are not rough beads, but you can feel them helping to scrub dirt and oils off your skin. This is really a fantastic product and worth the try if you haven't used Dove Men + soaps before.", "Having gone through much of the Dove Men +Care Face and Body Bar, the specific attribute I can distinguish this soap by is its ability to make my showered skin feel as slick as a freshly waxed car.This incredible, moisturizing bar soap has scrubby bits inside. My skin feels completely free of any residue after I wash.I enjoy the fresh, manly scent and the clean, fresh feeling I get from using this bar soap; it is like no other.", "I haven't used a bar of soap in years, and now I remember why - they're not as sanitary or convenient as shower gel. Just because it's soap, doesn't mean germs can't grow on it. Plus, I have a little dropsy, and don't like playing 'find the soap' after it falls and it noisily ricochets all over the tub.This soap does smell very nice, but it takes some effort to get the same lather shower gel instantly offers. It cleans well, and my skin feels nice, but it just doesn't offer much to make me turn away from gel and go back to bars of soap. Guess it just comes down to personal preference.", "\"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep CleanIn the shower, or at the bathroom sink, in a soap dish, Guys should have their very own body/face bar!  'nuf said.Comments from Dad:  \"\"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean has a very strong, masculine, scent -- it's not flowery!  Lathers up quickly and rinses well in the shower.

What else can you say about soap?Well, it smells great on my husband - a definite plus, for him! It doesn't seem to dry out his skin and since we have softened water, it is sometimes difficult to feel like you have rinsed all the soap off. This is good and doesn't seem to leave a residue.", "This soap has a strong scent that is similar to an old school men's soap. I'm not in love with that scent--it is not my favorite. However, I can see it working well on dirty, sweaty skin.It's also a scrub soap, so you feel like it's exfoliating your skin. Not a lot, though.I prefer new school men's fragrances like Axe.", "The Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar is a deep cleaning soap bar. I have used two of the other Dove Men + Care bars and like this one too. Does what its supposed to without drying my skin. I haven't used it on my face but I suppose it's fine for that too. The bar lasts a long time as long as you keep it on a soap saver.", "\"Even though my husband prefers body wash/face wash over bar soap, I convinced him to try these.  And to his surprise, he liked them!  He said they lather really well, and do give an exfoliating, deep clean.  They don't dry his skin out like some soaps do, and they have a really nice fragrance, like most of the Dove for Men product line does.I also love (and I'm sure he does as well) that these are for face and body.  He doesn't like having lots of \"\"lotions and potions\"\" as he calls it for basic hygiene, so it's really nice that these are for all over.We continue to buy Dove Men + Care products for him, and this great product is another reason why!\""], "A": [0.02917277067899704, 0.027105897665023804, 0.0365787036716938, 0.0385168120265007, 0.03218875825405121, 0.02485058829188347, 0.026035498827695847, 0.031562305986881256, 0.03833283111453056, 0.03478807583451271, 0.03875504806637764, 0.03947125002741814, 0.003301176242530346, 0.03327467292547226, 0.034672919660806656, 0.035460568964481354, 0.02778363600373268, 0.03000119887292385, 0.025448454543948174, 0.03603465110063553, 0.03744687885046005, 0.02244684286415577, 0.032317161560058594, 0.01790725253522396, 0.03499354049563408, 0.035344887524843216, 0.032119326293468475, 0.020910300314426422, 0.03518878296017647, 0.038023095577955246, 0.03544970974326134, 0.03451639413833618]}
