I have no idea how they apply to this new model.", "ProsClip on remote works well and helpfull.Sound is very good.

SEE THE BOTTOM FOR DIFFERENCES OF THE 2 STRAIGHT FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITE.==========================================================================================================I bought this based on someone talking about it in a SOCOM match. The reviews here also were good. First off, I don't have a true surround system. You really need that when playing shooter type games to hear where your enemy is around you. This headset does a pretty good job in helping you locate the enemy. But it is far from perfect. First off, its not built that well for the price. In \"\"Stereo Expander\"\" mode there is a loud background hiss. Chat Boost does not work at all. The quality of the headphone speakers are what you would expect from a $[...] pair of headphones. I know headphone quality, I have headphones ranging in price from $[...] to $[...]. And one of the most annoying things about this headset is the noise the plastic makes every time you move your head. All that being said, you can hear much more in a game then you would normally. I play SOCOM and my gameplay got better because now I can hear people walking around and tell which direction they are from me. The increase in my score was enough that if offsets all the negative things about this headset.PROSLong CordEasy Set UpHelps you locate the enemy in shooter gamesSeparate game and voice volume controlsBass Boost works moderately wellSeems sturdy enough to last awhileYou can turn the mic offGood for when you want to not play and wake people upCONSBackground hiss in expanded modeMaterials make noise whenever you moveSound quality not that greatEarphone cups are a little smallChat Boost doesn't work, at least not inSOCOM: US Navy Seals Confrontation Stand AloneOverall, if you don't have surround and play shooter type games I recommend it. Otherwise, I would not bother.UPDATE:  Keep an eye on the metal pin that holds the clip in place. It barely locks in and can work its way out. Took about 15 minutes to get it back in, pain in the butt. So check to see if its working its way out every so often.========================================================================================================FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITEEar Force P21 vs. PX21 ComparisonIf you're wondering what improvements have been made in the Ear Force PX21, here's a summary of how it compares to its highly acclaimed predecessor, the Ear Force P21:The PX21 Works With XBOX 360.An XBOX LIVE mic jack on the PX21 amplifier makes it compatible with the XBOX 360. All of the features that make the PX21 a great PS3(tm) headset also function on the XBOX 360.Works With PC & Mac Without Adapters.The PX21 replaces the P21 dual RCA jacks with a 3.5mm audio plug, so it works with PC's and Mac's without the need for an extra adapter.Acoustically Tuned Ear CupsThe PX21 ear cups, ear cushions and speakers are acoustically tuned for optimum fidelity. That means you'll hear crisper highs and deeper lows for an improved gaming experience.Improved HeadbandThe PX21 headband has been increased in size for greater comfort.Improved USB Audio ConnectionThe PX21 uses a stereo USB audio chat channel with improved fidelity, compared to a mono USB chat channel on the P21. This means you can use the PX21 as a stereo USB headset for listening to music and other stereo sources on your PC or Mac.Improved Ear CushionsThe PX21 ear cushions use the same soft fabric weave as the popular X31 and X41 headsets, with deeper and softer cushion material for even more comfort than the P21.Improved DesignThe striking chrome rings on the PX21 make it stand out as a high-quality headset that looks like a natural companion to the PS3.\"", "Let me start off by saying that the PX21s have decent sound quality. Better than the TV. The build of the headset is feels pretty cheap overall. Does it feel heavy on your head? After an hour or two you will start to feel the headset clamping down on your head (mostly your ears) and you'll want to take it off. The control module (where you control the chat volume/game volume/bass/etc.) has a clip, and that pretty much snaps if you drop it, cheap. They say you won't disturb anyone while wearing these; that's only half correct. Sometimes I just use the headset for game sound instead of the TV. When you turn up the volume on the headset, others will hear it. I doesn't isolate the sound very well, even when I am wearing it. If I knew it was going to be like this I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. I think $80 dollars is a bit overpriced for the weekend gamer. Now, the sound quality? It's decent, like I said, better than the TV. If your playing a shooter game you'll be able to hear somebody sneaking up on you. The microphone boom feels very plasticy. The sound quality of the mic is once again, decent. Now let's get to the pros and cons.Pros- Decent sound quality- Decent microphone quality- Good bass... BOOM- Appealing design- You won't disturb anyone while your playing.. unless you have the volume of the headset turn all the way up- Pretty easy to set up (less than 10 minutes)- Long cords, 20 ft. +Cons- Ears hurt after about an hour (Feels like headset is clamping down on you)- Overall quality feels cheap- Microphone boom feels cheap- Sound control module clip breaks easy[UPDATE 2/14/11]The left (L) side now has no sound, this is due to bad wiring. I know this because If I bend the cables a certain way, the sound comes back and it I release it, the sound goes away. These headphones have made me better, but not by much anymore, considering that I can only hear from my right ear. I mostly use it for in-game chatting now.I wonder if this product comes with a 1-year warranty or something... I would really like that.************************************************************************I hope you found my review helpful. I have been using these for a few months now. Well actually, to tell you the truth, I rarely use them now. When I first bought these I used it every day and now when I wear them, it just bothers me.", "Wire gets in the way. Wire was on the wrong side of where my ps3 was. would not recommend this.", "The sound is great, you can adjust the bass + chat volume. Why spend $200 for Dolby 7.1?? The cord is sooo long(16ft!!!, had to wrap part of it up), which is good for me since I use a 9.5 foot HDMI for my Ps3 to TV(Ps3 being farthest from me). Also the RCA Splitter cable(wire for the TV) enabled me to plug in another cord without having to buy an extension cord. Stereo Expander Switch, especially great for playing games like Battlefield 3 where you can hear slow footsteps, running, etc.Next time I'll graduate to the wireless, but since I paid $65 no tax no shipping fees, I'm satisfied. I was forced to buy a Headset because I had pre-ordered the new Hauppauge! HD-PVR 2 for $161.14 no tax no shipping fees, which is great as well.REMEMBER to REGISTER all products you buy, online leaves a better paper trail than by mail.Another note: I know that Amazon.com is taking Best Buy, ABC Warehouse, etc. to the cleaners & effecting statewide jobs with their lower prices, no tax, free shipping & fast quality service, but people like me have to budget every dollar & be smart about every luxury item. Sad but true.", "Awesome headset! Sound quality is superb when gaming late at night. Microphone is pretty good. Setting up is easy with PS3 and mac/pc. I was able to kill two birds with one stone with this headset, gaming and voice chat on my mac and pc. Sound sometimes cracks but not very often.(could be my cables). And all the cables can be a pain sometimes. But I am a casual gamer so these definitely exceed my standards. If you are contemplating on getting these or the tritton ax 180s, get these. It is so worth the extra 10 bucks. Much more comfortable, sound quality is better, more full and vibrant, in my opinion, structure/sturdiness and functionality, and design... Not too mention you will be sound whoring like a boss!", "The P21 provides both great sound and a great mike in one headset. I got this headset so that game sounds would not permeate the house, and I'm pleased with the performance. I realized that the ability to distinguish where certain sounds came from would not be present, so I wasn't surprised with that deficiency. But that appears to be the only deficiency, and I'm learning how to compensate for it. And unlike my 6:1 sound system, I can hear softer sounds better.", "I needed a pair of headphones with a microphone that allowed me to play the PS3 at night without disturbing others and also allowed me to chat in-game. This headset does that. It's very easy to set up and use, has a fantastic mic, and provides independent volumes for game sound and chat. Unfortunately, it sounds pretty terrible.As far as I know there is no product at this price point that does what the P21 does. You have to spend quite a bit more if you want something better (like the Astro A40s).The problem with this headset is the amplifier. It's garbage. It introduces all kinds of hiss and noise into the signal, and isn't capable of driving the headphones properly. My $10 pair of Sony earbuds sound better than this, never mind the Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 Pro or Sennheiser HD600s I perfer using with the PS3.The P21s are definitely overpriced and they sound like absolute garbage, but they do what they are advertised to do. That's about it.", "Overall these are decent headphones but I have few little niggles that many of the other reviews have already noted.  I bought these primarily for my son, so that he wasn't blasting the the big system all night long. After using these a few times I picked up a set of Tritton AX pros for myself, as these just weren't up to snuff in my book, although my 12 year old loves them.I can't really compare sound quality as my primary surround system comprises of Marantz Preamp and amp coupled to Martin Logan electrostats, my gaming headset are AX Pros, and my music headsets are Grado reference. You can't compare apples to figs, but I suppose they do sound OK for what they are. The amp gain noise of these is pretty atrocious though, magnified 10x when you turn on the sound expander.  The mute button is difficult to negotiate in the middle of a heated battle.  Chat boost seems to only be a gimmick and there is no discernible difference with it enabled or not.  After calibrating to reduce mic echo these are pretty decent being used only for communication.  The ear cups are quite comfortable and outside sound passes through fairly well, useful if you wish to use them for communication only.  The mic boom feels quite flimsy and I'm afraid that my son will break it, but only time will tell.  Overall build quality is ok, I can't say on par for the price, but it is just ok.Those that claim these to be surround, these are 2 channel. Those that say that these are the best around have not looked around.  These do the job for the price, but that's about it and there are better for the same price.  Be prepared for mediocrity.  I've compared these with a neighbor'sTritton Universal Gaming Headsetand the trittons are leaps and bounds ahead of these and about the same price. If you want to move up from there, although I can't directly comment as I haven't heard them personallyTRITTON AX 720 Dolby Digital Surround Sound Precision Gaming Headset for XBOX Live, PS3 Network, PC and MAC.would be a nice upgrade.  What I can personally recommend if you want to get your money's worth areTRITTON AXPRO True 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound Gaming Headset for XBOX, PS3 and PC Gaming.Absolutely phenomenal for the price.  Yes they are 2x the cost of TBs, but great sound, great build quality, and much better immersion.With all of that said these are ok headphones.+ Voice and Game sound in 1 unit.+ Decent sound reproduction+ Comfortable+ My 12 year old son likes them.- Horrid amp gain hiss- A bit flimsy feeling- Sound expander should be renamed noise expander- Mute switch leaves quite a bit to be desired- Chat boost is worthless- Price to performance is a bit offAs a side note for any headphone, make sure you break them in before evaluating.  Drivers tend to get warmer and sound less hollow after break in.", "First of all, the sound people have been complaining about only happens when you raise the chat volume. It is very noticeable when it is much higher but I do not put my chat volume over the game volume. If you do not care about hearing the game better and knowing whether or not someone is near you in a shooting game, do not buy this. I have not had these long enough to say if this breaks easily because people complain about that but you do need to take could care of it. The set-up takes 1 minute and very self-explanatory. If you play on a daily bases, you should buy this. For the people who are deciding whether to get the X11's or the PX21's, think about it this way. If you have a PS3, you need the PX21's because they are the only ones that support it and you should defiantly not get the P21's, they are not even close to as good as the PX21's. If you have and Xbox 360 and aren't looking to save 15 bucks on buying the cheaper x11's then chose the PX21's. They have more features and less of a buzzing sound. They also sound very good and it is easy to speak and be heard. If you need to save money, go for the x11's cause it is almost the same thing. Here are some of my pros and cons.", "I use this product all the time. I also use it to record live game commentary onto youtube. This is a handy headset, plus the sound is amazing.", "\"My P11's broke so I decided to give these a try. Overall, pretty good headset. Fit is pretty snug, the P11's felt a bit oversized in comparison. Sound is pretty good on these despite being stereo headsets. I wound up returning these simply due to the fact I found a pair of Black Ops 2 Tangos on sale. Two issues I had with these headsets is;1. the hissing noise on these were irritating. If you use the \"\"surround\"\" sound on these then the hiss becomes greater. Not a huge thing but it is noticeable.2. The control module is pretty awkward. It sits pretty close to the headset so I had numerous instances where I'd accidentally move the knobs on the module whenever I moved around. Clipping it on to your shirt sorta alleviates this problem however it feels awkward. The P11's didn't have this issue since the control module was further down the cord.Overall, for the price, pretty good headset.\"", "When living in a house where you have to be considerate of those this is great, but the sounds can sound static-e at times. I hate the mic because its just to big and no matter where u put it, if your not using it you just look stupid.", "I'm extremely happy with these headsets. I purchased two, one for myself and one for my husband. We used them to play Black Ops, and this allowed me to hear footsteps coming up on me camping! I heard a lot of trash talking because they were getting killed over and over again. Even more when they find out it's a girl! The voice clarity is great! Great price point!", "Pros: great sound and control.long cordcomfort +Cons: none yet ... they feel solid but the swivel looks like a likely spot to break ... just from all the other reviews.Other thoughts: The way I see it, I paid about as much as a new game which would be old in about a year if not sooner. so if they last that long I'll be happy ... will update if the break.", "After having two of these headsets I'm done with turtle beach. The sound quality is good, and I love being able to mix my game and voice volume however I want. I bought a second pair after the first one broke after 4 months of regular use and being well taken care of. I bought it again because I liked the sound quality and was hoping it was a fluke. I was wrong, after a little more than a month of use the new pair began cracking and the plastic just broke apart. I kept them going for another couple of months using glue and tape, but they finally just cut out. If I had gotten these for 20 bucks from wal-mart I could understand, but for a reputable brand and higher pricetag I expected more. Don't waste your money on turtle beach, or any of the mid-range gaming headsets for that matter, take time, save up, and get something that will last.", "The head set is comfortable and the sound is great.....this head set has a wire but don't worry the cord is plenty long enough.......", "I have had my share of headphones, like the AX720 (Digital Surround), X31, Ear Force DSS(Digital Surround) paired with the AD700, and now the PX21.If i had started with the PX21, it would have been my only headphones.  Light, Great sound, nice price.Get it and you wont regret it.  it might save you from going crazy into buying more expensive options.It lacks the directional prtecission of higher priced products, and the high quality sound of Audiophile Headphones, but for $80 you get everytnog you need for online gaming with the mic, and multi console compatibleI just went through a gaming marathon with BC2, Dragon Age Origins, GTA Episodes, MAG.  The headset performs GREAT in all around gaming sound.  Really comfortable. no after use headache or weird ear feelings, just awesome.I sugest to turn off the mic when not needed, because the mic has a feedback mechanism which allows you to hear what the mic picks up, so ambient noice might bother while playing RPGs.  Just turn it off and you are good to go.", "Not real surround sound. Can't really tell what sounds are coming from where. I ended up selling them on eBay. The only good thing is that it has voice feedback meaning you can hear yourself talking thru the speakers so you know how you sound and if you're talking to loud. Tritton ax pros don't do that.", "My son wanted some gaming headphones for the PS3.  I tried a couple other headsets that were not suitable for the PS3.  In short, headsets with standard analog input/output or USB input/output don't really work for the PS3.  The reason is complicated but it involves how the PS3 separates the game sound from the chat sound.  Turtle Beach designed special connectors and circuitry for the PX-21 especially to allow chat and game sound to be combined in one headset.  He's happy. I'm happy.  By the way, Amazon had the best price as of early January 2011.UPDATE 1-23-11  These headphones broke less than three weeks after we got them.  I'll test Turtle Beach's warranty service and update this report accordingly.UPDATE 2-14-11  Turtle Beach provided replacement headphones received under warranty.  No stars deducted.UPDATE 7-18-11 These headphones broke twice since we received the replacement set.  The first time, I repaired it with duct tape. This time it looks like the patient is terminal.The biggest problem in terms of construction is the hinge that connects the headband to the earcup is too delicate.  This part needs to be completely redesigned.Due to repeated breakage, I'm lowering my rating to 3 stars.  Maybe that's a little too high."], "A": [1.7042767197494868e-08, 0.21475638449192047, 1.258802629002585e-18, 3.8196335481188726e-06, 0.20473714172840118, 0.007794754579663277, 0.00030306997359730303, 8.005767604402081e-09, 2.780690909123827e-24, 5.3050564019940794e-05, 1.0505099687628774e-18, 2.0285289073496138e-11, 1.5837499116449767e-16, 0.21327102184295654, 0.001784555148333311, 0.14533184468746185, 8.352535988700137e-15, 1.44328789913363e-14, 1.8300483521025692e-15, 0.21196438372135162, 2.1397252858434967e-09]}
