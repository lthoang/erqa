{"reviews": ["After previously using the Shure SE210's and the Sennheiser CX-300's I found these earbuds to be so much better. They are better in just about every way. First lets just look at the important stuff like sound quality, comfort and sound isolation. These earbuds blow those other two earbuds away in sound quality. The bass is so much better in these. I realize now how much bass was lacking in my shure se210's. The bass is also not over powering the other sounds is still very balanced and sounds really good. In terms of comfort these are much much more comfortable then my shure's or sennheiser's. Also in sound isolation these are so much easier to get a proper seal. With my sennheisers and shure's I would have to fiddle so much to get a proper seal. Some times I would spend 15 minutes or more on just trying to a get a proper seal so that I could enjoy my earbuds to get enough bass and isolation. With these earbuds I dont have to spend hardly any time trying to get a proper seal. Now on to the remote and mic part. Conisdering that most earbuds cost a lot more than these and dont even come with a a mic and remote these are a really good deal. I was already looking for a mic/remote combo for my newly purchased 3rd generation ipod touch. I decided to get these even though I didnt need new earbuds and was pretty happy with my shure se210's. Boy was I wrong I am really glad I decided to get these to repalce my earbuds. The remote is very easy to use and also very light. I like how the mic/remote is place in yoke of the earbuds rather than just one of the sides of the earbuds. The remote and mic work great with my 3rd generation ipod touch. If I hold down the play/pause/talk button it activates the voice control on my ipod touch and then the voice asks me what I want to do. I can change track, shuffle, choose a playlist and or ask what song is playing. I also use the mic with the other apps on my 3rd ipod touch like: shazam, skype, voice memos, icall and I am T-pain. Ive also tried using the earbuds with my blackberry bold. None of the buttons work, but, I can use the earbuds to listen to music on my bold and take calls (just the mic and headphones work to listen to the audio part of calls). Overall I am really glad I purchased these. I am a bit concerned about how long these will last in terms of the build quality. The wires are very thin and light so not sure how long they will hold up. The lenght of the cord is about right. It is a little on the short side and could be a few inches longer to my liking. There is also some cord noise when I go out walking and its windy, but, its not really that bad. Not very loud. Also most earbuds Ive tried have the cord noise anyway. I still havent tried these for working out yet. I bought them mostly for walking and taking the subway/bus. I find the sound isolation to be very good on these. But I have found that my shure se20's were slightly better in isolating sound around me and could be done at lower volumes. The klipsch's are not as good as isolating sound but I find the more I fiddle with them to get a better seal they seem to get better in isolating noise around me. Plus I can always jack up the volume a bit to block out the noise around me. Edit: After owning these headphones for more than a month now I can say I havent had any problems with them so far. Also have to add these earbuds are much easier to keep clean from ear wax then my previously owned sennheisers and shures.December 2011 Update: After owning these earbuds for more than 2 years now I can say they are still going strong. No real issues with them. Still sound great and are reliable. Only bad thing I can say is they do get tangled up easily and then its hard to untangle them thats about it on the downside.", "These are very comfortable for long periods of listening - moreso than any of the others I've used (from Shure and Etymonics). Further, the sound reproduction is quite good, though you do have to make sure to fully insert them to get a solid seal and good bass.The only downside is that they're not quite as noise-isolating as their name suggests. I can quite easily hear outside noise through them, even more than in some of my other higher-end in-ear phones. So, buy them for comfort and sound, but not for the noise-isolation; for that, you might want to go elsewhere.", "\"As a recent convert to the iPhone and a headphone junkie, I was making due with my old earbuds and no mic, willing to sacrifice convenience for audio quality.  After I stepped on and crushed my Shures, I was living with some Sennheiser CX400s while I dug around the apple site and tried to find a decent pair of headphones that could capitalize on the new inline-remote features. I was having no luck until I found these.The audio quality on these bad boys is plenty good.  Much better than the Sennheisers (which cost about the same), not as clear as the the Shures (which cost twice as much), but with a lot more bass.The beauty of these headphones is the inline remote.  It's a snap to control the volume, skip or repeat tracks, and use the phone hands-free without taking your iPhone out of your pocket. You can also use voice-commands to control other aspects of the iPod, which is cool but I've barely used it.  I get self conscious standing on the train saying \"\"Play Songs by Wayne Hancock\"\" loudly into my sternum.  The remote/mic is so lightweight I barely notice it on the cable, and I have gotten no complaints about voice quality.  All in all, the cabling is pretty lightweight (and on the short side, but long enough to make it from your pocket to your head), but the earphones and joints seem sturdy enough to last for a while.  There's a two-year warranty though, just in case.Two caveats: the first pair I got was defective and almost immediately started malfunctioning.  Amazon replaced them right away and the new pair has worked flawlessly.  Second, I liked the included rubber sleeves but prefer foam, so I used the foam tips from my Shures, and they really make a better seal.These are a no-brainer if you are looking for better headphones for your iPhone.UPDATE:  It looks like I wrote this review over a year ago, and these things are still going strong (the replacement pair, anyway).  I use these five days a week for at least an hour or two, so there's some wear and tear: the rubber around the connections on the earphones and the plug is split, but to their credit, they still sound and work nearly flawlessly.This isn't a new problem, but I finally put my finger on it:  every now and then the buttons get switched up, and up is down and vice-versa.  It's just a momentary annoyance, but I thought I'd mention it, especially in light of the fact the there's a ruggedized version of these coming out any day now, S5i.  Built with a sturdier cable and a moisture-proof remote/mic, they might be the right choice if you're going to be taking these on runs or generally manhandling them a lot.  Haven't seen 'em though, and these are still the champ until I do.I have only one complaint about the design itself: the have a straight plug instead of the L-shaped type.  It makes the phone/ipod seem that much taller with these plugged in, and I feel like it puts unnecessary stress on the soldering when they're yanked on.\"", "I got these a few months ago. I compared them to Etymotic Research HF2 Earphones; I chose the Klipsch because it also had volume controls on the little controller. I think this was a wise choice as I do find that handy.Other notes: The noise isolation is substantially less than the Etymotic, however that can be a good thing in the car, so you are not so isolated from the outside world. The Klipsch are also easier to put in, and can be easily put in part way for phone calls or to just prepare for a little later when you want them fully inserted.The sound is not as wonderful as Etymotic, but still very good.When used for phone calls, the sound is amazing and really helpful to hear a caller in a noisy situation (including loud cars), but the noise quieting on the mic is less good. I get some complaints that I am hard to hear/understand.The cord tangles MUCH more easily than Etymotic.They are quite comfortable and sometime need a twist in your ear to get the sound right.", "Even with the iPhone-to-Samsung adapter, the buttons never worked properly for me on a Samsung Epic 4G from Sprint (same as Samsung Galaxy II, not Touch). But as earphones they work fine.", "\"Let me start with the basics. Go to CNET and read the review. Start there. Read other reviews. They all highly recommend the Klipsch S4i and with good reason. What's not to like? They are comfortable, decently constructed, affordable (in the realm of what audio equipment, headphones in particular, can cost), and most importantly, excellent sounding earphones. Which brings me back to my first question: if you are a consumer that does your research before dropping $100 - which you probably are since you are considering Klipsch earphones and otherwise would be purchasing Bose's $100 in-ear offering (which aren't all that terrible) - you already know this stuff. Here's a rundown of what you can expect anyways. First, the construction, while not solid enough to warrant outright abuse, should hold up in day-to-day use (excluding ripping apart tangles and pulling the earbuds out abruptly by the wire - that is NOT normal use). Second, the audio quality and detail throughout the frequencies is superb. The headphones don't distort at high volumes, and the thick, \"\"ghetto\"\" lows are matched by a lifelike, smooth midrange that works wonders with vocals, guitars, etc. Third, the higher frequencies are harsh. There's no getting around it, these earphones are tiresome to listen to if you can't appreciate the knifelike detail throughout the upper frequencies. This pair attacks the highs and brings severe detail to the upper band of the audio spectrum. If you want smooth, relaxed listening, buy the Bose offering. They offer similar comfort, construction quality, and decent sound that also packs a healthy amount of low end grunt, if not the detail and clarity through the mids and highs. However, that is not Klipsch. Klipsch equalizes it's products to have a super low end, exaggerated high end, and balanced, powerful midrange. The result: fantastic, multiple-genre capable earphones that may take some time to warm up to for users accustomed to smoother, less offensive sound reproduction. Just know that those highs probably won't soften up much with burn-in. Love em' or hate em', this is a fantastic set of earphones for what they are: somewhat colored and extremely detailed.\"", "These are Klipsch headphones, and they sound to the same caliber as Klipsch headphones should; highs are high, lows are decently low, but they do have a slightly muddied middle that tends more downward than it should.  However, I'm a tough critic to please, so that's not terribly surprising.The thing that bothers me most about the Klipsch is the design of the remote.  Never before in my iPhone headsets have I had a remote that bulged out so far it got unintentionally pressed as these Klipsches, and they do it routinely.  I can barely take these to the gym without having to stop what I'm doing every five seconds to restart the music.  Also, there is tons and I mean tons of cord noise on these headphones.  I've seldom heard less-runnable headphones in my life.  Even under my shirt, which has typically been my solution, these headphones still make a cacophony of their own on top of my music while running.  Let me put it this way, if I hadn't gotten these as a gift, they'd be back at Amazon two weeks ago in a heartbeat.Skip these if you can.UPDATE: After a few months of light usage, the left earbud of these just stopped working one day.  Fortunately, Klipsch stands by their products, and they're shipping me a replacement set to come here in a few days, but it is certainly not the quality of product that I had expected.", "I bought these back when they were $90 and they were worth it back then. At $50 they're a steal. The buttons are in a great spot that makes changing the volume, skipping tracks, or pausing easy to do. Especially helpful if your pockets make it annoying to pull your phone out repeatedly. As an added bonus, I was pleasantly surprised how well this picks up your voice for phone calls. I thought I'd have to hold up the microphone (located on the backside of where the buttons are) and talk into it but people can hear you with perfect clarity with it hanging by your chest. And most importantly, they just sound great. Keep in mind I'm no audiophile but songs sound noticeably better than your average buds.I've had these with my Iphone 4s and Iphone 5 and they've worked on both without a problem. If I end up breaking mine somehow, I'll be buying these again.", "I got these headphones to replace my old earbuds, a cheap but decent set of Creative earbuds.  The Klipsch are very comfortable to wear.  The tips are oval, instead of being round.  This makes for a better fit. When you have seated in the right position, the sound is very good and they do a great job of isolating outside sounds.I use them with an Apple iPod Touch 2G and I wasn't sure if I needed the Apple control or not.  I'm glad I got them (there is a cheaper model that doesn't have the controls).  It's very handy to pause or skip tracks without having to pull out the iPod.  The volume control is handy.  There is a microphone, but I haven't needed to use it.  That would be handy with the iPhone.The sound has plenty of bass, but not overpowering.  You do want to play around with the multiple size tips to make sure that the ear pieces are seated correctly.  That makes a big difference for the quality of sound and the amount of ambient noise that will be blocked.  If you don't own a recent vintage iPod or iPhone, then you'll want to look at theKlipsch IMAGE S4Headphonesinstead.  Pretty much the same headphones, just without the Apple controls.", "I am very pleased with the sound, fit, and sound isolation of these earbuds! They fit my ears perfectly and provide better sound isolation than the other brands I have tried. The sound is natural with a very decent bass and clear midrange and high end.", "I have to say, these headphones suck. They aren't &#34;that bad&#34; but when you have a product that has so much built up hype, you expect them to perform to a certain level. These do not.Most of the reviews you will read on here are your average consumer. They wont know the difference between a true flat sound and a bass heavier sound. These headphones are just bad. The sound that they produce is not true to the music and sounds cold and the bass sounds hollow. They do however get quite loud and can probably burst your ear drums if you go to full volume on your device of choice.I have one other grudge with these headsets. I have two phones an iPhone for work and a Samsung Galaxy S3 for personal use. These controls work fine for these particular headset on my iPhone but they do not for my Samsung. I have tried various adapters and such but these products simply do not work. The middle button does pause/play a song on occasion for the S3 but the mic, and all other in call functions do not work at all. If you want to spend $50+ dollars for these go ahead. But I would have to say go elsewhere to find your new headset because honestly these are well overpriced and should honestly be advertised around $20-$25 dollars not $50+.Hope I helped, cheers.", "Just when I think I'd found the best in-ear earphones (JBuds and Sonys), I decided to splurge for this set with my Amazon points. Holy moley, there is NO comparison in sound vs. the others I've own. Unfortunately, because of the  butt-end or larger ear-piece protrudes out further compared to my Sony's, the S4i won't stay put in my ears. I am continually adjusting and repositioning, and then resorting to a little saliva. Rubber cable sheath also drags on clothing which also causes them to fall out. Aggravating. Audio quality 5 stars, design of unit, no so much. Wish they would stay in long enough to enjoy my tunes. Button control works fine.", "I could not use softer words.Klipsch is exploiting its brand name with this cheap $10 worth headset.1. The cable is cheap and not flexible, very odd and uncomfortable to wear.2. The sound is OK, nothing special comparing to others like Sony, Sennheiser etc.3. The case/box is also super cheap, and won't even close after a couple of uses.While I'm not saying these are bad headphones, I guarantee you will feel ripped off, just like I did after investing $50-$70 in a $10 worth headset.For the same price you can get a MUCH better headset.", "I purchased these after seeing many, many rave reviews across the Internet.  I was bummed because my 4-year old Shure earbuds were dying and they have been perfect.At first, and I mean like for the first 2-months, I was certain I had made a terrible choice purchasing these.  None of the things I had read about them in the reviews were coming true for me. No noise isolation.  No good bass.  No comfort in ear.  Zip.  Nada.  As a matter-of-face I had come to the conclusion I couldn't stand them and was going to simply have to buy another pair of ear buds from another manufacturer.But just the other day I made a discovery which has completely changed my opinion about these S4i's.... You have to put them in your ear the right way.This may sound rather obvious, but there wasn't anything in the accompanying literature or anything I recall reading on the Internet about fiddling with them to get them into your ear just right.  I had been changing and trying all the included ear tips to no avail.  But while at work I accidentally turned one (physically turned the body of the ear bud) such that the cord was now poking out almost completely horizontally and the ear bud slipped slightly, but perceptively deeper into my ear and everything changed.Now they were isolating me from noise.  Now the bass was solid.  Now I was happy!  Unlike the Shures I had previously, which required you to put them into your ear in a precise manner to make them work properly, the Klipsch don't exactly talk about this.  But a gentle twist/turn of the other ear bud and suddenly everything made sense.All in all, and now that I have them fitted properly, I'm enjoying these ear buds much more in the same manner as all those great reviews out there.  They feel good.  They sound fine.  The button control works as advertised and is very, very handy, and I appreciate that they placed it after the cable split so it's not attached to one side or the other, thus making one ear bud pull slightly more.", "i bought these to use with my iPod shuffle (which needs the remote on the earphones to work).  The Apple earphones that came with the shuffle were pretty much junk - muddy sound, uncomfortable to wear, impossible to keep in my ears, etc.  But, I expected that since its been the case with every iPod I've ever bought (and there have been many!).  I tried the more expensive Apple replacement earphones, but they are almost as bad - the remote is fiddly to use, and besides it just breaks if you use these earphones while while you run or workout!I returned the Apple earphones and bought the Klipsh Image S4i instead.  The sound quality is considerably better than that produced by slightly cheaper Apple earphones, and not too far away from my Shure e4c, at least not while wearing them on a noisy treadmill.  Like Shure, the Kilspch earphones do a good job of blocking out external noise.  If you like a LOT of bass in your listening you will probably prefer.the Klipsh earphones at less than half the price.In summary . . .Positive: Decent sound quality; robust, easy to use remote, light cables don't drag and cause noise; strong bass.Negatives: Light cables feel 'delicate';some sibilance in vocals'; bass might be too strong for some people.All in all, these Kilpsch earphone are good replacements for the Apple supplied or upgrade earphones for an ipod/iphone.", "I love this brand of audio gear.  These ear buds sound like they should cost three times the price.  They are extremely comfortable and do not fall out.  You can wear them all day.  The sound isolating is surprisingly good for a passive sound isolating device.  I prefer the sound, comfort, and noise isolation of these, over the most costly brands, which i have also tried.", "if you are looking for the ultimate in sound, quality and noise canceling...you have not found it.  But these are great sounding ear buds.  I have Bose headsets and I have the Parrot Zik which i love but Headsets are just not as convenient as ear buds like these - maybe I am old fashioned but I cannot call these headsets yet.They sound great and they are in your ear.  There is no noise cancelling effect like an over the ear real headset like the Bose or th Zik.  You just cannot get that out of a &#34;headset&#34; like this.  They do not sound as good as the Bose or Parrot Zik but they sound good.I have already lost one of the rubber tips on an international trip and though that is minor, I do wish they came with extra or were easier to order or would not fall off so easily.  That is an irritation.I have had cheaper in the ear sets and honestly, these are better but I would be fine with much cheaper ones.  For me, it is hard to tell the difference in the sound until I get to the really good over the ear headsets.  To be honest, I have no strong feeling about these one way or the other.  I do not think they are wonderful nor do I feel that they are not worth the money.  I just was not as impressed as I wanted to be.  I guess my expectations were unrealistic but i thought they would have more distinctive sound and noise cancelling.Bottom line - I would not purchase them again personally but if you do not want over the ear headsets and are looking for solid good quality sound, go for it and get these.  I would not count on the noise cancelling too much.", "These are the best in ear headphones I have owned including ones that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  I wish they had a soft case though.", "These are not so comfortable, I dont like the sound quality, and I have already ordered a replacement set of ear buds. If you go for name alone then by all means waste your money. If you like to get quality look else where.", "I can only compare these headphones against what I have used (iPhone headphones and Koss PortaPro) and these are very good, but not exceptional, headphones.If you use the iPhone headphones, then these will be a worthy upgrade. These sound superior and are far more comfortable than the Apple iPhone earphones. The Bass is clear but not overwhelming and you will hear much of the background music that you otherwise would have missed with lesser headphones.The iPhone controls and microphones work well but it does take some getting used to. I have found it simpler just to use the iPhone speakers when talking on the phone.These are sound isolation headphones so these are perfect for airplanes and libraries because your neighbors will not hear your music.If you do not care for the sound isolation and want a slightly more natural sound, then I recommend the Koss PortaPro which is far cheaper. The PortaPro has far more natural Bass and sounds little more lively than these headphones. These headphones, however, renders far more accurate sound. You will be happy with either headphones unless you are a stereophile. But then again, if you are a true stereophile, then you probably wouldn't listen to iPhone's compressed AAC and MP3 music anyway.From anecdotal evidence, it seems you can buy better headphones for far more money. But these headphones should hit that sweet spot that conjuncts affordability with high sound quality for most people.Just like all speakers, these phones will need a break-in period of 10-30 hours of music playing before rendering their optimal sound. So if these headphones sound disappointing at first, then let it play some music. Also, you will need to position these earphones in your ears properly for optimal hearing, especially bass.This headphone also works with iPhone 4. I just successfully tested it on my new iPhone 4.", "Good at the price would recommend,  fit is ok ...sound is good...works good price was good....I like these for every day use..", "After countless pairs of the stock Apple earbuds failing, I decided it was time to find a replacement product capable of primarily listening to music and audiobooks, and secondarily to make phone calls from my iPhone 3G.  Prior to settling on the Klipsch S4i, I used my Shure SE530 IEMs that I use with my iPod at work.  The audio quality on the SE530 is slightly better than on the Klipschs but they should be as they cost about 3 times more, too.  In all other areas of importance, though, I have found the Klipsch buds to be superior -- long term comfort, seat more securely in the ear, ability to make/receive calls, ability to control iPhone from cable controls, and appropriate length cable (Shure is much too short).  Before obtaining the Klipsch S4i, I also ordered and returned the Jaybird Freedom Bluetooth headset; the Jaybird was impossible to adjust for comfort -- even with Acoustibuds, would not stay in the ear and the sound quality was severely lacking.  Next to be auditioned were the Ultimate Ears MetroFi 220vi.  I wanted to like the UEs -- I liked there small size and sturdy appearance.  After a week of use, though, they also were returned.  The stock tips were all very uncomfortable and would not stay in the ear.  I then purchased some Comply foam tips which improved both the comfort and audio quality of the UEs but they would not reliably stay in the ear.  The worst part of the UEs, though, was the rigid cable which would not lie flat, got caught on stuff and transmitted lots of rubbing noise through the cable to the head.  As far as comparing the audio quality of the Klipschs to the UEs, they are comparable but I think the Klipsch's sound is a little more precise.  I also like the positioning of the remote iPhone control much more on the Klipsch -- it was too low on the UEs and it is also nice that the Klipsch has integrated the mic and controller into a single node on the cable.", "\"I purchased these earbuds \"\"used\"\" from 1 to 3 Shop, who described them to be \"\"as new\"\". And this they were. The box had been opened and resealed, but the earbuds appeared to be untouched.The sound quality of these earbuds is uncanny. You can hear the full spectrum of music -- the highs, the lows, and the in-betweens -- with startling clarity. Previously I had a set of earbuds from a well-known high-end manufacturer. They cost nearly $200. At a fraction the price, the Klipsch units are superior.There's a trick to using these earbuds which I got from another reviewer: Insert them in your ears, then twist them around so they are \"\"upside down\"\". This creates a perfect seal and the sound quality jumps.Altogether a highly satisfying purchasing experience.\"", "These earphones have premium sound for the price and is very comfortable in the ear.Highly recommended.... better than bose.... quick note to get the best sound the earpiece tips must make a good seal in the ear canal, had to use there largest size ...nice deep bass...clear highs ...and good voice... also they are very very comfortable in the ear compared to other circular shaped earpieces.", "this is my 2nd pair (after leaving the first pair on a redeye flight!) - so repeat purchaser.  i did try more expensive versions before settling on these for their quality and fit.  I purchase some foam earbuds to use to help improve their noise-isolation properties (a tip I learned from another Amazon reviewer!).  they work well with my iPhone, given some added flexibility on controls.", "These earphones are not for the faint at heart in terms of cost; however, those wanting a high quality audio response and pretty darn good noise isolation, you cannot beat the value. I recently purchased a second pair of the S4i earphones for my wife. We both have iPhones, so the iPhone-friendly buttons are a plus (nearly a must). The bass response is tremendous for such a compact set of earphones (try Godsmack's Awake for demo). The treble response probably exceeds most people's hearing (Keely Smith - You Go To My Head). As for noise isolation, with these earphones in place I cannot hear the annoyance of the office air circulation or people shuffling around. Additionally, the numerous soft cones provided with the earphones allows for a very custom fit. Great job, Klipsch!As for customer service, no issues with my order. I did lose the alligator clip on the first set of earphones. Klipsch replaced those with three days of my e-mail to them!If I did not need to listen to anything around me, I would most likely wear these earphones all the time. They are extremely comfortable and have awesome sound quality of any range at any volume.If your budget fits these earphones, you will not be disappointed. Even if your budget is below this price, you will not be disappointed.", "These are great. I use them at work when I need to edit sound/video and the rest of my office is being loud. They block out unwanted sound really well. The sound quality is also fantastic. Music and phone calls sound great! Definitely the type of quality I expected from a Klipsch product. I used to work at an electronics store selling some Home Theater products and as soon I heard a set of Klipsch speakers I have been a huge fan of their products. They know what they're doing!", "I have found these earbuds to be the best. I've purchased others for less and more money; including B&W for 170.00. Although admittedly the B&W have better separation they can't compare with fit. Once you get the Klipsch seated in your ears they sound incredible. I have two pairs of these because I couldn't stand thinking about going a day without them should I loose a pair. I listen to them nearly everyday. You can't go wrong buying these. The price is very reasonable as well.", "Needed a pair of wired headphones for work. Great sound quality but I typically walk around with only 1 ear bud in and had issues with it staying in place. Never had any complaints about microphone quality.", "I have a lot of headphones.  I've wasted a lot of money, especially on ear buds.  The problem I run into most is fit. Maybe I have weird ears, but there are only a select few ear buds that fit comfortably (ideally unnoticeably) into my ears, and as a result, sound great.  Sure the drivers are important and all that, but when it comes to ear buds, finding a comfortable, sealed fit is challenging.So these headphones somehow fit perfectly into my ear.  The material that the tips are made out of is exceptional.  As a result of the fit and solid hardware from Klipsh, these headphones sound great.  I love them.  Though, just as the thousands of other reviews mention, the cord on this older model of the s4i's sucks.  Its been updated to a nice flat, matte finish cord in the latest version of the product, which I will most likely purchase eventually.The moral of the story here is if you want good sound, pursue good fit.  If you have had trouble finding good fit in the past, try these ear buds.", "Good: look nice, a lot nicer than the picture actually. Feels solid, especially the flat wire. The angled buds also make the pair very comfortable. Noise cancellation effects are average but the base beats the Samsung OEM pair by a mile at least!No-So-Good: the buttons are useless on my old iPhone 4, iPad, iPod, and Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Tab 10&#34;. They are not reliable and do weird and inconsistent things. So it's pretty much useless. I use the device controls instead.The Bad: right ear starts to resonate and hiss in the 1st hour on certain note from symphonic music on my iPod Classic. It got so bad I have to skip the music sometimes. The left ear remains flawless. Both buds work fine with other type sound, movie sound tracks, rock, whatever. But I love the overall sound of this pair, it made my iPod shine like never before. Too bad this one fatal flaw forced me to send it back. From the other reviews, this doesn't seem to be an isolated problem.Never used it for phone call so don't know the quality of the Mic.If Klipsch can remove those useless buttons and controls and get rid of the resonance problem, I'll get myself another pair in a heart beat!", "I bought the headset for my husband, to replace destroyed ones. He loved the quality and black little protective pouch. He could carry the set in the pocket with an iphone.Unfortunately he lost the pouch at the airport.The quality of the headset is great, they fit good and are comfortable, good in sealing the outside noise for listening to the music and for talking even on loud airports.I just received new earphones and they came with big metal case instead of snap pouch (the web description indicates the pouch). Have to return it because there is no way you can carry this bulky case with an iphone in the pocket, it is very big and it might scratch the iphone.Also I couldn't find the pouch anywhere (this specific kind), to bad. Love the headset but Klipsch please make the pouch again!"], "A": [3.870568362346338e-12, 0.0013171989703550935, 3.263363306491051e-16, 2.976085984040689e-19, 0.24331863224506378, 1.537626850084612e-17, 9.133288585871924e-06, 6.545775033117707e-10, 1.1635499150546708e-13, 0.01800721324980259, 1.4925929416043093e-12, 2.0052300897077657e-05, 0.013491831719875336, 2.5968467525672168e-05, 1.8268179857727773e-08, 4.425259703566553e-06, 4.753602898341521e-16, 0.2439032942056656, 4.3349096534583964e-10, 1.1601124227933468e-10, 0.24255642294883728, 2.4820961148439426e-16, 0.011337919160723686, 5.694025730917929e-06, 0.1854158490896225, 8.138867997331545e-05, 4.7261541347154434e-09, 0.008663353510200977, 2.0442811887733114e-08, 0.022598901763558388, 2.9368147017508817e-28, 0.009242676198482513]}
