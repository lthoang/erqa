{"reviews": ["This is a relatively strong black tea with an earthy flavor. The ginger is relatively subtle, but it's there. Next time I visit the local Asian market, I'll see if I can find an imported pu'erh with which to compare this. My wife, who is from China, thought this was OK, but she generally prefers Japanese-style tea.", "I have to be in the mood for ginger and this is definitely a gingery tea. While a huge fan of pu-erh teas, this might be my least favorite, battling for last place with the basil mint. With that said, this is still a good tea, particularly for fans of pu-erh. It has all the health benefits of pu-erh and ginger, so those who appreciate either will probably appreciate this tea too.", "Compared to other teas, this has a light spicy flavor. I tried it after a large meal and it did help the food digest. It is a pleasant way to end a meal. No need to add sugar to this tea. It does not have the deeply bitter taste of most black teas. Will be buying this and other Puerh brands from now on.", "I have been a fan of the rich, earthy flavor of pu-erh tea for years, with my favorite variety being the Yamamotoyama 1690 variety available from Stash Tea.  I have been drinking fine teas for decades and enjoy many of the loose teas that Stash and Harney & Sons offer.This Numi tea quite literally pales in comparison.  The brew is not as dark, and the flavors are much milder, washing out some of the intriguing character of the pu-erh tea.While it doesn't taste bad, it is not comparable to the rich pu-erh experience I am used to.  Although it does have some character of pu-erh tea, it is much milder, almost a diet cola to the full cola of the Yamamotoyama tea.If you're going to spend more on a premium pu-erh tea, I recommend you try the Yamamotoyama 1690 variety alongside this to determine which you prefer.  Some people may not like the fuller earthiness of the Yamamotoyama tea.", "I am a huge tea drinker (3-4 cups a day and an avid Numi fan. I buy theNumi Organic Tea Rooibos, Herbal Teasan, 18-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 3)and drink it on a regular basis. My favorite Numi tea isNumi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Full Leaf Black Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 2). However, this Cardamom tea has quickly become my second favorite tea. I drank two cups of it in as many hours.The caradamom is a pleasant aftertaste and gives it a rich aroma, yet, the tea doesn't feel overwhelmed by it. This organic tea is delicious and has the capability to awake all your senses.It's great as a morning wake-me-up tea, as an afternoon teatime tea, and as a bedtime tea. In short, this is one of the best teas from Numi, which are one of the most wholesome tea companies in the world right now. Life's short, why drink anything bu the best?", "Pu'erh might be the black sheep of teas, the fermented cousin of your favorite black teas. Sometimes funky, sometimes spicy, it's a tough blend.Yet Numi hit the nail on the head with this one. Blessed with a few dashes of cardamom, this might be my favorite bagged tea out there. I can't make that up. This is head and shoulders better than most chai in terms of a full cardamom flavor. Yet it lacks the spiciness and retains the complexity of flavor. This can be sipped plain just fine, but if you so desire milk and sugar, it doesn't hurt! 100% worth the purchase.", "I was a bit concerned about trying this, as the smell of the tea bags was very gingery.  But, this turned out to be a most pleasant treat.  With a touch of honey that I added, this was sweet and spicy at the same time.  It was pleasant to drink and relaxing.The only thing I wasn't fond of is the amount of caffeine.  I am rather sensitive to it, and didn't realize just how much it had in there.  After a cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes at 8pm, I was up most of the night.  But, if caffeine doesn't bother you, then this shouldn't be a problem at all.", "I am a regular tea drinker who generally favors basic black teas to flavored ones. However, this was a pleasant departure from my usual habits. The Numi Ginger Pu'erh tea has a light and soothing ginger flavor. In particular, the ginger blend is just right, and is not overwhelmingly spicy.Note that I found this tea to be loaded with caffeine - which gave me quite a buzz as I wasn't expecting it.", "They say this ginger tea is earthy because it tastes a bit like dirt. Seriously.  Not an altogether unpleasant taste, and I can see it going very well with Thai food because it has the ginger notes.  But on its own, as an afternoon pick me up, I was disappointed.  It is supposed to help with weight loss, energy, etc...even motion sickness.  But it's very plain and the ginger could definitely be stronger.I made it and iced it and it was a bit more tolerable with a squeeze of lime.  But not something I would choose again.All its medicinal benefits (as claimed) can be found in Argentinian yerba mate (at Trader Joes, besides here!).  It has a grassier flavor but it feels on purpose rather than just a questionable dirty water taste.A side note, several of the teabags leaked their contents, thus ruining the entire cup as I have no itty-bitty sieve to drain it through.  Perhaps a manufacturing flaw....", "Ginger Pu'erh Tea Bags.  The taste of this tea is peppery and earthy.  I had to get used to the peppery and earthy taste, but it is worth it.  I do love tea, and I love trying different types and flavors.  This is indeed a type and flavor that I've never had before, and it is quite different.I did try it both hot and cold, just to be fair.  I will tell you that I am not a hot tea drinker (it makes me feel like I'm drinking tobacco), but I do love cold tea.  Needless to say, I did not like the tea hot (but what tea do I like hot?), but I loved it cold.However, if you are normally a hot tea drinker, you will, I'm sure, like this tea hot.I bet this tea would be nice around Christmas with peppermint sticks.  (I would drink mine cold.)According to the box, Pu'erh is an anxient healing tea picked from 500 year-old organic wild tea trees in Yunnan, China.  How cool is that?And check this out:  the product is organic and kosher; the box is recycled & recyclable, biodegradable tea bags; the programs lower and offset carbon emissions, including a solar facility; organic tea cultivation protects the environment.But best of all:  the product is fair trade, so that the people can be paid a fair salary so their families can be okay; the tea cultivation takes care of and protects the farmers and their families.  Now that is the best part of all.  I love the tea, and if I can do anything to help these people, just by buying their product, then I will do so!", "\"\"\"Ginger Pu'erh\"\" is the second tea that I've had from Numi, a private tea company that specializes in making a unique blend of herbal teas harvested by farmers in China.***I am a green tea drinker.  Literally, drinking between 3-5 cups per day.  And, I have been for years.  And, I know a good cup of tea.  These blends, have struck me to be exquisite.The \"\"Ginger Pu'erh\"\" is a mixture of ginger leaves and Pu'erh leaves in a package that tastes like a ginger tea but without the slight spicy aftertaste associated with ginger.Now, don't get me wrong.  I love ginger and I love the spicy flavor of ginger, \"\"Jamaican Ginger Beer,\"\" being one of my favorite drinks.  But, the addition of \"\"Pu'erh\"\" leaves seems to mitigate the harshness of ginger to make a really smooth (not spicy) cup of tea.***Numi is a family owned company that prides itself on ethic business practices and ecologically (green) harvesting.  They also state that their packaging is from recycled paper.So, it's a win-win-win for everyone.\"", "Apparently Pu'erh is not my cup of tea. I was looking forward to trying this because I love tea and I love cardamom, but the pu'erh is so distinctive and strong in its flavor that I couldn't even pick up on the cardamom. All I could detect was a taste of something that, to me, had gone rotten. That's the best way I can describe it. It left a picture in my mind of wet tea leaves rotting in garbage. Two sips was all I could take before dumping the cup and throwing out the whole box. Yuck. I will stick with my black teas, oolongs, and green teas.", "This delightful organic tea is fresh and invigorating. A lovely dark red brown when brewed, this beverage is a prefect balance earthy pu'erh tea and exotic cardamom. It is hearty enough to replace morning coffee but still smooth and luxurious enough for after dinner.  I especially appreciated that there were no additives and that the tea bags are naturally biodegradable.  The Numi Company prides itself on corporate responsibility to people and the environment. You do pay more for food you actually can feel good about but in this case the taste and quality justify the cost. Recommended.", "I was not impressed.  The ginger taste was too muted.  This tea was way too earthy for me.  It reminded me of steeping random dried leaves and twigs from my yard--no, I have never steeped yard vegetation, but that is what came to mind.  I also used this when brewing a batch of iced tea and did not like it any better.", "Although I drink a lot of tea, I'm no connoisseur -- so take these comments with that in mind. (Although my go-to tea I always keep on hand is a blend I buy over the phone from a mom and pop operation that still doesn't have internet ordering, so I guess I am kind of picky.) I pretty much only drink black teas, like earl grey, Russian blends, sometimes lapsang, etc. I'd never heard of this pu'erh stuff before, but I love cardamom, so had to give it a try. Most tea I've had with cardamom is basically a black blend of some kind with some pods thrown in for flavor, and while I generally enjoy them, they always go down better with a little milk added. The milk seems to soften the bitterness the steeped cardamom can sometimes throw off. These bags, however, come out nice and strong, but smooth. I guess it's the green tea being used, but there's no bitterness. There is, however, a noticeable tangy aftertaste -- kind of like what saccharin produces. I could imagine that being a big problem for a lot of people, but it didn't bother me. I tried it instead of my usual morning cuppa, and it definitely seemed to do the trick in terms of caffeine. Probably something I'll keep on hand from now on for when I want something a little different.", "\"i drink a lot of black tea & this one taste great.  i find Lipton & even Twinnings English breakfast tea rather dull, but this one is rather flavorful.  Pu-erh is what the Cantonese call \"\"Bo-nay\"\" tea, which is their favorite, often had at dim-sum lunch.  the cardamon added here gives it an additional richness.  i can use one tea bag for a 10 oz. cup.i plan to buy this again & keep it in my regular stock of teas.\"", "Most of the teas that I drink fall into the scheme of traditional black teas or flavored black teas, so this tea fit into my general sphere of enjoyment from the beginning. I really enjoyed the slight kick of ginger coupled with the deeper pu'erh essence.I would definitely recommend this tea, particularly for menstruating women since the ginger is soothing for cramps and the pu'erh tea will help perk you up.", "Numi has combined light spice flavor with the earthiness of pu'erh in theirCardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags, 16-Count.  Although labeled as a black tea, pu'erh is technically a dark tea.  It has undergone a true fungal fermentation for 2 months, which gives it the rich, strong flavor redolent of an earthy, loamy fragrance.  Depending on the strain of fungus and length of fermentation can produce quite different nuances.To complement the pu'erh taste Numi adds green cardamom pod pieces (you can see them in the tea bag).  This combination produces a great flavor that can be consumed straight or with your favorite sweetener and/or dairy product.  Each will bring out a different flavor of this tea.", "Pu-erh tea is the only tea that can be aged, like cheese, and whose flavor can change over time.  It definitely is a specialty tea -and has a richness, or a slight smokiness that other teas lack.  Rare (old) Pu-erh teas can command incredible prices, as once the stocks of a famous vintage are depleted the prices skyrocket like old bottles of classic wine or scotch.  (And if you search online ---you might be able to find a super-specialty tea house and could pay up to $300 for a pot of the rarest stuff, 60 years old.  Wow!!!)That said, most Pu-erh purchased isn't aged for long  (a couple of months?), and it is usually only a little more expensive that regular teas.  Numi sells that kind.  It is a mass market, organic, high quality bagged tea.  If you are trying Pu-erh for the first time, then this brand is a good one to try -it isn't too expensive, and it doesn't require you to purchase loose tea (which the finer teas usually are) which requires the purchase of extra tea straining equipment.But, if you are specifically looking to try Pu-erh tea, then I recommend avoiding any of the FLAVORED Pu-erh teas, like this one, and try the plain one first -it's the only way you'll know if you like the underlying teaI liked his one a little better than the other NUMI flavored Pu-erh tea that I tried -the cardamom one.  I think it is because the ginger taste was much more subtle, and I felt it complemented the Pu-erh better than the slightly overpowering cardamom.  It also had a slight peppery taste that I liked.  However, I do think it could have used more ginger.  Though it was present, the tea really didn't seem like it was all about the ginger.  If you want lots of ginger you'll probably be disappointed; if you want it to be subtle, you'll probably like it.", "\"This tea is delicious. I enjoy the flavor of cardamom. It reminds me somewhat of my favorite chai--not as sweet, not as strongly flavored, but tasty. Further, it is a \"\"green\"\" product, including the teabags and packaging. I had never had pu'erh before and didn't know quite what to expect. My guess is that, if you enjoy chai, you will enjoy pu'erh as the two are quite similar. This product is contains green tea extracts and antioxidants, so it should fit into a healthy lifestyle.\"", "I've sampled Numi's Cardamom Tea as well as the Ginger Pu'erh Tea.  I don't know much about tea so I did a little research (I'm sure folks will let me know if I'm incorrect or not.).  The Pu'erh tea is a fermented tea.  The packaging lists it as a black tea but it is not what we in the West know, traditionally, as a black tea.  It is a dark tea and in Yunnan, China, it is considered a red tea.  The other ingredient of this particular tea is organic Cardamom (which is in the ginger family).The tea should be allowed to steep for 3-5 minutes.The Cardamom tea had a nice, light scent with a stronger ginger flavor than I had found in Numi's Ginger tea.  There was very little after-taste.  I much preferred the Cardamom tea over their Ginger tea.  If you like ginger (and I do) you'll love this tea!", "\"Ginger fans- very mellow gingerPu'erh fans - very mellow pu'erhGeneral fans of black tea - a nice warm, balanced blend,I love tea.I am, generally, not a fan of Pu'erh and I usually choose fairly basic black teas and I love a cup of matcha in the afternoon.  Pu'erh, as I have tasted before this particular blend, is rather \"\"earthy\"\", and by earthy I mean that it tastes, to me, like moss and cigar in garden runoff.  It's just not the kind of thing I would choose to drink again... EVER. No way.I am, though,  a ginger fan.  I love ginger.  I buy pounds of the knobbly root and use it in many different foods, every day.  Tasty stuff and I like the benefits.So, when faced with Numi's Ginger Pu'erh, I had hopes that perhaps the warm and snappy root would overpower and mute that stale, cologne overdose of Pu'erh.It didn't.  The ginger BALANCED the Pu'erh.  The Pu'erh mellows the ginger!  Numi Ginger Pu'erh is actually tasty!I would certainly buy this and drink this again.

Just keep the lid on your teapot and steam.  The weird smell will come out in the steam.  When you are ready to pour your tea and enjoy it, you will be treated to a pleasant aroma and taste to match!  The tea is still delicious and the deep, rich, intense flavor delighted my taste buds.Drinking this tea is a liquid security blanket.  It is good for reducing and relieving stress and it just plain tastes good.  Pu-erh has many healthful properties as do black, white and green tea.  Cardamom is known for being a healthy spice.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS in this tea!", "If there was not a picture of tea and ginger on the package, you would not know there was any ginger in it at all. Ginger must be expansive because they are really stingy with the proportion.The box touts health among recycle and fair pricing, etc. but I just want something convent and tastes good. I will finish off the box but am disappointed in the way, way, way too subtle ginger.I just thought maybe they plan on using sugar to bring out the flavor. I do not use sugar in tea.", "While this tea is soothing, smooth, and quite delicious, it is not what I expected. The smooth, comforting taste of pu'reh tea is there, but the ginger is very mild. Prepared with 6 oz of water per tea bag, there is a faint hint of spice from the ginger that lingers on the roof of my mouth, but that's it. If that is the intent, then it delivers. But to call this a spicy ginger tea is misleading.I have long purchased tea from Numi. One of my favorites was the loose ginger tea I would buy by the pound. That was amazing and spicy. I had hoped I had found it again in tea bag form. But not so. I will probably buy this tea in the future. I am drinking some now as a matter of fact. It's just not the spicy punch I was looking for, and doubling up on the tea bags would ruin the pu'reh tea flavor.", "\"Let me start off by saying - this does not taste like regular \"\"real\"\" pu'erh tea. That is the stuff you get in a solid brick. It has a much milder flavor, which actually works pretty well with the additional ingredient (cardamom).If you were to go by the initial smell of the tea as you opened the bag, then you would pretty much assume there is little to no cardamom in this tea at all. Very hard to discern with just the tea bag. Even after steeping, the cardamom flavor is pretty mild and sits way in the background - if you weren't looking for it, you might not realize what it is. I just drank the tea plain (steeped for 4 minutes, directions say 3-5), but as with the ginger tea, I think that adding a small bit of honey or other sweetener would round out all the flavors a bit more.I was not sure how I would feel about this particular tea as I'm not generally a pu'erh drinker (too strong for me still), and I'm still not sure how I feel about this. I really like the ginger version of this, but this one doesn't seem to have the flavor of the other. I like cardamom and would appreciate having the taste of the tea be a bit stronger with the added spice. All-in-all, this one is just \"\"ok\"\" (though my husband seems to really like it) - unless you're just looking for a mild-tasting black tea. The tea itself is very good overall, just missing the cardamom flavor.\"", "Pu-erh tea is a black tea produced in the moutainous Yunnan province in China by  a special open-air fermentation process.  Supposedly the fermentation mellows the taste and favor of the tea.  Unfortunately this Numi Ginger Pu-erh tea is anything but mellow or favorful.  It tastes like plain water with a hint of ginger.  It has no tea favor.  Furthermore it has an unpleasent fishy smell.  This is not my cup of tea.", "\"We love tea and when we got a chance to sample this Numi Ginger Pu'erh Tea we opted in. The 16 bags should give us enough time to determine what we like about this tea. The box states that the tea is, \"\"Organic--ancient healing tea packed with antioxidants\"\". Frankly I have no way of knowing about such claims. The package  also states that the bags are biodegradable. That is interesting and fits into our \"\"save the earth\"\" scheme.The claim about  what this tea could do for you is astonishing. \"\"Used for treatment of cough, cold, congestion, and as a stomach settler. There is also the claim that this tea goes through a 60 day fermentation process which has a distinct and profound affect on the tea leaves. While the label clearly states, \"\"Made in USA\"\". I doubt that to be a factual statement. Since later on the company says that the tea is sourced from the mountains of Yunnan, China. Now that I believe. There is a large range of other teas and flavors that Numi has listed.This one is \"\"organic\"\", \"\"halal\"\" and \"\"kosher\"\". What more can one ask? My granddaughter loved the words, \"\"gluten free\"\" on the box so they now have another customer from just those words.You can enjoy this tea either hot or cold. We tried it hot first and will more than likely keep with the hot version. The tea is rather strong compared to some other teas we have tasted; therefore don't leave the bag in the cup too long. There is a deep early taste along with the peppery, spicy ginger. I love ginger thus this is great with a few ginger snaps.There are many more claims about the benefits of this tea, such as being an aid in digestion as well as a help in weight management. While lower in caffeine that some coffees, this tea is not caffeine free. However there was the statement that this was a \"\"perfect coffee alternative and a restful night's sleep\"\". I found  was wide awake after consuming a cup of this tea, thus it may work differently on different people. Then I read the package wording, \"\"HIGHER CAFFEFINE\"\"I go along with the claim that this is a deep dark tea. I like the tea and will be trying some of the company's other tea products soon. They say this tea invigorates the mind and I will just have to see about that as I consume all sixteen cups from the package.\"", "\"I failed to read the description before I drank it just as I would normally drink a cup of tea, for taste. It has that gingery, spicy taste, but it just seemed a little salty to me. As I came here to review it, I took time to read the description:\"\"Used for treatment of cough, cold, congestion, and as a stomach settles. Used in prevention of motion sickness. The unique 60 day fermentation process has a profound and distinct affect on the tea leaves and their taste; Results are a deep, earthy flavor with a touch of malt\"\"That changes everything for me. I would not drink it for taste, because the taste of it is not my preference. I can see how it might feel good on a scratchy throat or to someone who has a cold or cough.\"", "\"To me this tea was fine, nothing special, although perhaps this teabag version is not representative of traditional Puerh tea.  I was interested in trying Puerh because I had recently heard an interview about \"\"China's Dark Teas\"\" on The Splendid Table (google-able). I tried both the ginger and cardamom flavors.Traditional puerh comes in cakes or loose leaves, and is supposed to be \"\"rinsed\"\" for 10-20 seconds in hot water to remove impurities and start the tea opening.  Then steeped for about 30 seconds per cup (and the leaves can be re-steeped in more cups).  [Find out more about traditional puerh on the TeaSource page for puerh.]In contrast, the instructions on the package of teabags just say to steep for 3-5 minutes.  Does this tea have some sort of pre-processing that eliminates the traditional rinsing, or did they just used boiler plate instructions? -- the box doesn't say.  However, I didn't detect any major difference in the flavor of the rinsing water (15 seconds) and the cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes, so it doesn't seem that this tea needs the traditional pre-steeping.  The color was quite dark, but the flavor was much more mellow than some other plain black tea brewed to the same darkness.Of the two teas, the cardamom flavor was nice, but the ginger flavor was pretty minimal.  Without the spice, the 3-minute steeps would be too weak for my taste, lacking the fragrance and depth of, say, a good English Breakfast tea, but the cardamom rounded out the overall flavor.  So I would recommend getting the cardamom flavor rather than ginger.I steeped a second cup of each flavor after the first, for 2 minutes, and while the second cup of each was weaker, the spice flavor was a bit stronger in proportion, especially the ginger.  So to get relatively more spice flavor, you might need to steep for the full 5 minutes.  The second cup from the same teabag was sufficiently weaker that it doesn't seem like you could get many cups out of it, as described on the TeaSource page for traditional puerh tea.\"", "This product was given to me for my review.Numi brand Cardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags brew a bold, slightly sweet and spicy tea that I found to be delicious in a few ways. The first time I brewed the tea, I had it black with nothing in it. Normally, this is not my preferred way to drink tea, but I have emotionally needy pets, and simply did not have time to doctor my cup up. Surprisingly, the tea was very tasty. The slightly spicy flavor of the cardamom with the pu'erh tea mixed well together, and I did not encounter any of the bitterness I was expecting from a darkly brewed tea. The second time I made the tea, I used it in a soy latte (Cardamom Pu'erh tea, Silk Soy Milk with DHA and Omega 3s....the only soy milk I like...andSonoma Syrup Vanilla Blend Extract 8 oz, and a dash of cinnamon.
