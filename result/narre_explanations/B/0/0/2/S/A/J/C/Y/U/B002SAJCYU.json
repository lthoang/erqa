{"reviews": ["No complaints.. It's pretty much want I wanted. Design matches the R.A.T. 7 mouse I bought along with it. Keys feel good, the lighted keys aren't over-powering. The USB Cable could be a little longer but, over all great product. It doesn't have any fancy macro keys or anything like that but, that's what I bought it for.", "This keyboard was purchased for playing games. It looks good, has a soft touch, works great and costs very little. The backlight looks awesome. This keyboard can't be beat.", "There's something about the feel of these quiet keys that draws me back. The keyboard has features that seem especially suited for a writer.  First of all the keys feel unusually smooth to the touch and the edges are soft so for someone who types fast, the sensation of moving over the keys is more pleasant than other keyboards I've used.  Each depression offers a light resistance that is consistent all the way down which I find not only provides good feedback but is very satisfying.  I seem to make fewer typos.  I've used several other keyboards that have too light a touch to suit me.  With those, I either skip letters because I think I've depressed the key all the way, but actually haven't, or conversely repeat letters because the key goes down too fast and stays down a fraction too long.  I find the action of these keys to be perfect.My requirements for a keyboard were that it had to be corded to work reliably with my computer, i.e., fast all the time with no lag.  The keyboard had to have audio adjustment buttons so I could mute the sound easily when on the phone and alter the sound level as well.  I find the sound level adjustment better than my previous keyboard because each depression of an adjustment key makes a noticeable difference so usually only a few depressions are necessary to get the change I want.  It takes 25 depressions of 'louder' key to go from no sound to top sound, so there's a good range, but I hear a difference each time I press it.  Perhaps my previous keyboard was unusual, but it seemed like I had to press a key a hundred times to make a difference.The right most of the four hot keys above the number pad adjusts the backlight from off, on-bright, on-dim, off again.  The bright is too much for me so I'm happy to have a less bright setting.  I wouldn't have chosen red, but it serves the purpose.  The backlight feature is especially useful to me when I'm typing in the late afternoon and darkness creeps up.  If I'm engrossed in something, turning on the backlight allows me to continue working until I come to a good stopping point and can tear myself away to turn on the ceiling light.  The other good thing about the backlight is that it shines through the letter on each key.  Hopefully this will ensure that these keys remain readable long after other keyboards' letters have worn off.My keyboard didn't come with the software to program the function keys, but the enclosed booklet gives the website where it can be downloaded if needed.  I only program the function keys with macros in Word and Excel so I don't need the software for fancier operations and can't speak to that.The detachable wrist rest isn't the keyboard's best feature for a writer.  It's great for a gamer who may be using the letter keys with one hand and the arrow keys or number pad with the other, but for someone who has both hands on the keyboard all the time, the wrist rest doesn't provide even support for both hands.  Still that hasn't slowed me down.I like the ledge above the function keys, which I use to rest a pen, and I like that the lock indicator lights are obvious (in the center above the function keys), bright and clearly marked so I can instantly tell if I've got something locked that shouldn't be--instant notification when I hit the Caps Lock key by mistake.The keyboard's protruding corners seem a needless design affectation, but don't interfere with the function I like so much.  So far, I'm more satisfied with this keyboard than any in my past experience and highly recommend it.", "Well I decided to wait to review this keyboard and get a full month of use out of it. I lvoe the color, its bright and the settings are a good variance. The construction doesn't feel cheap or cheesy and is solid and industrial looking. I am on my computer alot, and always gaming, it really adds a nice touch visually and is responsive and feels good to type on.I really have no complaints about this keyboard, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good looking gaming keyboard or even someone who wants solid quality and needs to see at night with no lights on, this thing is very bright!I had never bought a madcatz product before, nor have I heard of them but I will definitely look for their products now!", "this keyboard looks amazing, and is more comfortable to type on than any other keyboard i have ever used. for a casual gamer/ college student, this keyboard is more than adequate. look no further.", "\"I like it because it's simple. No crazy drivers to deal with and malfunction. Just plug it in and use it. Recognized w/o issues by my new system on inital startup.I have used Cyborg keyboards in the past, had great success with them and was happy to see them availble on Amazon.I like feel of the keyboard. The keys take a bit of effort, but nothing substantial to activate the keys. I like this because at times when gaming I will \"\"fat-finger\"\" the keys. With this keyboard unintentional hits usally won't activate the keys.The red backlite is bright enough for low lighting environments without being intrusive.Very nice and simple keyboard. Highly recommended for gaming AND everyday use.\"", "Great keyboard, exactly what I expected. The illuminating blue keys matches my computer casing keys lights which makes allvery grand.......", "I wanted to get a keyboard with lights built in. This one has a lot of lights. My only complaint is that the spacebar is a lot brighter on the left side. I wish it was more even.", "\"I bought this product for the backlight feature.  It was OK, but the angle of the underlighting was bad because the keyboard wouldn't raise up enough to see the keys directly.  I suppose I could use books to prop it up, but that is a hack I don't care to have.  Finally, the program ability of the keyboard was limited and the USB wire was an annoying \"\"feature\"\" but not necessary for such a slow device!  I have replaced this keyboard with a wireless keyboard with extensive program features - but no backlight - Compromise?\"", "I've just upgraded to the Cyborg V.5 from the W9868BK that Amazon sells for $28.00. What a difference with the Cyborg! Much sturdier. The Cyborg offers thick rubber feet that stay secured to the desk. The lighting is far superior to the W9868BK. The volume control is an added bonus I didn't think I'd use, but find it very handy. In all the Cyborg is well worth the few extra dollars you might save on any of the cheapies you'll see offered.", "I was looking for a keyboard to use in low light light, this is my 3rd attempt at finding a decent board.I have been using it for a few days now and am very pleased with it's performance.It looks great with no lamp on and very easy to see.My last board was one of those compact boards with the keys crammed in so close I repeatedly had errors from touching 2 keys at once!That is not a problem with this board partly because of the shape of the keys being smaller at the top like a flat top pyramid.No errors no stubborn keys that you have to push harder than the others and the wrist rest is good too as I have mild carpel tunneland this board does not make my fingers numb from the angle I hold my wrists.All around the best board I have used in a very long time.Six stars!", "I would say this is the best keyboard I have bought. The rubber pads on the back have not torn or worn off. the lighting is trouble free. typing is good. palm rest is durable. I would buy another.", "I got this to go with my custom desktop setup. I have this keyboard, a razer naga molten edition mouse, and a gaming case with red led fans. I love my red/black setup and this keyboard completed it. It feels amazing and types with ease, plus the backlight is awesome! don't hesitate to get this at all.", "got this as a back up so only used a little but for the price its a sweet kb lights the keys very well and keys are not mussy", "other than an initial bit of stickiness on the space bar ( rectified by 10 mins of emailing) this is a clean product. the wrist support is nice, but i like it without as (to me) it looks cooler. the only things that would make this the best KB evah are: usb & headset ports on the side. but all the KB's that have that are scary expensive and i can't justify the differential.gaming is fantastic in all lighting cond. and i've had no ghosting issues.", "\"I love this keyboard. I love the red lights, I love the size of the keys, I love the click of the keys. This is almost the perfect keyboard. Why \"\"almost?\"\" I have owned a different model from this same manufacturer. I loved it too, but it did not take long for the letters to wear away. I am a touch typist and so that is not an insurmountable problem. But when friends used it, they often needed help. I continued to use that keyboard until it finally just up and died. I am downgrading this keyboard one star on the presumption it too will wear away quickly. But, unless someone comes up with a better lighted keyboard between then and now, I will purchase yet another from this company.\"", "I honestly thought it was going to be a little bigger. I've had this for a couple months, the lights haven't given out but I sometimes my WASD keys will stick to each other because of constant use. I should have bought a keyboard with media keys so I can skip tracks while mid game."], "A": [0.0009194622398354113, 0.18306870758533478, 6.688084113193327e-07, 0.18737202882766724, 0.1819741278886795, 2.277319843813075e-08, 0.1122843325138092, 0.012559504248201847, 2.1250299298003483e-09, 3.3977514135585807e-07, 6.866759605372863e-08, 0.18349742889404297, 1.634820344419488e-13, 0.04575072601437569, 0.08954036235809326, 5.5073742259992287e-05, 0.0029771493282169104]}
