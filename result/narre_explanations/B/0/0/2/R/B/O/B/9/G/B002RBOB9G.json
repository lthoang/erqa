{"reviews": ["Seriously, what is better than Lindor Truffles?  I had not tried this variety previously but I like cookies and cream.  This isn't quite the flavor I thought I was getting.  It is close to the cookies and cream, but slightly different.  A little more white chocolate than I thought it should have.  But it is still very good.", "I'm not a fan of dark chocolate so white chocolate has always been my preferred option.  This item combines, a nice soft white chocolate with what sorta tastes like cookie crumbs.  The whole house enjoyedthese little truffles, but it is a lot of chocolate in one bit.  You can use these as a candy, but another good option is putting this inside a raw brownie or cupcake before baking it.  Lindt has one of the best white chocolates on the market, and I always reach for this over the other white chocolate companies.", "I received a bag of the Lindt Stracciatella Chocolate Truffles as part of the Amazon Vine program. I normally love Cookies and Cream sort of things, but found these to be very sweet and very rich. It was a little too intense for me. And some of the nibs had very grainy qualities to them - at one point, I had some hard bit in my mouth that I was afraid was part of one of my teeth since it was so hard. It wasn't, but I also couldn't figure out what it was.Also, the bag itself got banged around during shipping, so many of the truffles were squished. I'd caution people who are considering purchasing these and having them shipped to think about the weather because these also melt very easily.", "This is a truffle based on Italian stracciatella, it has chocolate dust in white chocolate. I don't like this flavor as it's a little too sweet, flavor seems diluted or watery, and the chocolate dust is just unpleasant on the tongue. It tastes a little artificial like other reviewers have commented and lacks the creaminess of the regular white chocolate truffles. I have tasted many Lindt flavors and this was my least favorite yet. I did not like the aftertaste, it was overly sweet like an artificial sweetner aftertaste. The usual white chocolate or even milk chocolate and dark chocolate truffles have a rich and creamy mouthfeel and a pleasant aftertaste. This truffle melted instantly on the tongue and had a watered down and much less creamier mouthfeel. I usually like stracciatella flavored gelato and icecream and expected this to have a stronger vanilla flavor and much more creamier.The first package arrived melted and spoiled and had to be thrown out. I called customer service and they sent a replacement. I would be wary of ordering this flavor in the summer, especially if it has to sit in the mailbox or the front door as this one seems to melt much more easily than other varieties.", "I'd had stracciatella gelato before which I always think of as a rich chocolate chip.  But as for what it means, okay, so I didn't actually ask anyone, but I did look it up.  It means &#34;shred.&#34;  Makes sense...shreds of chocolate!Anyway, what I didn't fully realize was that these would be as white chocolate as they were (for some reason...my bad, I know since it's right in the description) because I normally hate white chocolate.But I LOVE these!  I don't know if it's because they use quality white chocolate or not, but it's so rich and smooth...the shell melts and has little hard bits (the chocolate nibs) in it, but the inside is so creamy and smooth, it just coats your tongue.  It's rich and buttery - not that fake harsh kinda tinny taste I get off of low quality white chocolate.  This is like a dreamy creamy sauce.Lovely.  And I really like the texture difference - 3 textures in one just makes it really fun to eat (creamy inner, solid shell, hard nibs)Even for those who normally might not like white chocolate...worth a try!  (and if you do like white chocolate already, I can't see how these could dissappoint)A very good flavor from Lindt!A suggestion though - if you buy these, make sure to get them either as the large count box, or if you get a smaller bag of them, order it so it ships with something larger, but not overly heavy...it'll make sure it comes in a box and help keep it from getting crushed.", "I have tried and enjoyed most of the Lindt truffles, and kind of adore them.  But these have bits of cocoa in the centers, and it feels more like little coffee grounds that are a nuisance rather than an enhancement.  They were actually really annoying, suspended there in the otherwise delicious and creamy centers.  If you crunch on the actual tiny piece, it feels more like a tiny piece of bark than chocolate.  Odd really.  Otherwise, the product line is great overall.", "I was looking forward to reviewing these for the Vine Program but they melted during shipment during the most recent Heat Wave that hit the West Coast.  I opened the bag to find a puddle of white chocolate and foil.  Drat.", "Lindt truffles are always good. I've tried quite a few of them but the stracciatella flavor is really great. I love the white chocolate flavor and the filling has that subtle crunch from the dark chocolate. The combination is really great for a midday or after meal sweet treat. Guests will love them as well. I have them in a bowl on my coffee table juuust out of arms length so I don't have too many at once.", "There are twelve pieces in each 5.1 ounce bag.  They&#8217;re in the form of a ball with a crunchy outside and an almost liquid gooey inside.  They&#8217;re lightly coated with almonds and must have almond flavoring as well because of how nutty they taste.  Four pieces have 200 calories.  The real danger is snarfing down the entire bag at once.  As always with Lindora products they taste delicious and the texture is wonderful.  The white chocolate flavor is perfect for those allergic to regular chocolate.", "First of all, these truffle candies are SO INCREDIBLY GOOD. The taste and textures are incredible. The product couldn't possibly be better.That's the good part.The not so good part though...The experience of receiving these from Amazon isn't necessarily hassle-free. Use your good judgement. I live in a hot climate (southern California). I wouldn't hesitate to order these from October through March. I selected these in April though and they were melted into candy soup. I had to chill them to make them edible again. But even after melting and reconstituting, these were still fantastic. I would have expected the white chocolate to be gritty after melting, but it was still velvety smooth.If you live in a warm climate, use your good judgement when you order these in the warmer months.", "The crunchy consistency and sweet vanilla taste of these live up to the cookies and cream description. I find these a bit oversweet since I generally prefer darker chocolates.  These are great for what  they are and could be your favorite if you prefer a sweet white chocolate with some crunch.  I recommend trying one of the Lindt assortment packs since they allow you to  to enjoy a range of different flavors.  Sixty truffles  of the same flavor is a bit much  unless you are sure this is the only type you want to eat. Lindt truffles are all wonderful;  the two problems I have are figuring out which ones I like best and eating too many of them.", "I sometimes wonder if I could go back in time and take these chocolates with me I could rule the world, or be very wealthy in anycase, all the European royalty enchanted by my amazingly rich chocolate balls.My absolutely favorite Lindt truffle is the one with milk chocolate on the outside and white chocolate on the inside, this is a close second with the white chocolate with the regular chocolate bits mixed in. But really, you can't go wrong with these, they're amazing - though I think something like 60 calories per ball, not a low calorie food certainly, but a delicious indulgence.", "I am not even a big chocolate eater but these are a great combination of a hard chocolate shell and a wonderful creamy center. I dare you to eat just one! They are so good!!", "The truffles were smooth and creamy with a hard white-chocolate shell on the outside. The inside was creamy and delicious. Embedded in the shell and center are pieces of milk chocolate. Although they were tasty, I prefer the smoothness of the regular truffles without the nuggets inside.", "The best description I have for these chocolates is that they taste like vanilla frosting balls with bits of oreo bits. I love Lindor truffles of many varieties, my favorites being hazelnut, dark chocolate peppermint and caramel. This combination, however, was just OK for me and so I give it average marks. Also, when I received them, Amazon's packaging was inadequate and they arrived having already melted and reformed, so they were oddly shaped and powdery, instead of the smooth centers I'm used to from Lindor's.", "We LOVE Lindt Truffles! I mean, I think we kept the company in business throughout our 6 pregnancies! Needless to say, we were thoroughly disappointed when these arrived and the entire bag was melted. You literally could not eat them because they were so melted and smashed. Unless they change the shipping method for these little gems, just buy them at your local grocery. They are well worth the investment, but shipping is a problem here for Amazon.", "If you're an older foody or chef, you might take issue with Lindt calling these delightful confections &#34;Truffles.&#34; Lindt Truffles do not conform to the traditional French composition of a chocolate ganache ball covered in milk or dark chocolate and optionally rolled in nuts or dusted with cocoa, but do not deprive yourself because of a problem with the name.Lindt Truffles are characterized by a hard chocolate shell and a smooth chocolate filling and come in a multitude of flavors.This version, the White Chocolate Stracciatella has a soft white center and harder white shell with bits of cocoa. Four of us opted to try one after dinner and ended up devouring our free bag of twelve. The only disappointment was that these arrived squashed into shapes more like coins than truffles. Given the fragility of these, going forward, I will not order them online.", "This is a truffle based on Italian stracciatella, or chocolate shavings in cream. The result is a bit sweet, and a bit gritty. The chocolate part almost tastes like coffee grounds. The white chocolate is overly sweet and has an artificial overtone, not like vanilla, hard to describe. Kind of fruity-fake. I really didn't like them. Worse yet, instead of the usually large box for even a tiny part that Amazon uses, they came in a padded envelope and were completely flattened and ruined. And melted--even though it's not all that hot out yet. I suggest you buy these locally if you like the idea of stracciatella truffles.", "These white chocolate 'stracciatella' truffles are so smooth and creamy that they simply melt in your mouth.  They have tiny specs of cocoa mixed that subtly change the flavor from that of the plain Lindt white chocolate truffles, but not overpoweringly so.  Each truffle is individually wrapped and is the perfect serving size...  if you can stop at eating just one.Mine arrive in hot weather and were very soft, so I was forced to put them in the fridge to re-set. This unfortunately hard set the liquid interior, but hey, I discovered that I liked the new 'solid chocolate' truffle just as much. I'll definitely be purchasing these again, although at my local store instead of having them shipped. 5-stars for the chocolate itself.", "I love these truffles.  They used to come out only at Christmas time, but they are apparently making them available year round now.  And, that's great because they are SO very good.", "I love all LINDOR truffles, but these LINDOR STRACCIATELLA WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES are truly out of this world!  The outer white chocolate shell incorporates crunchy bits of dark chocolate, and the creamy white chocolate center positively melts in your mouth.  These luscious truffles make you feel truly decadent.White chocolate isn't really chocolate--it's a chocolate derivative, usually made from cocoa butter,  milk solids, milk fat, and sugar.  The dark solids of the cocoa bean that are included in regular chocolate have been separated out.  Although I still love regular chocolate, as an adult I've come to appreciate the less strong flavors of white chocolate and vanilla more and more.A box of these Lindor truffles (60 individually wrapped pieces for about $14 plus shipping and tax) should make a wonderful gift or personal splurge for any candy lover.  They are delicate, and melt easily, but mine arrived cool to the touch because Amazon packed them in a refrigeration pack.", "These are excellent! The white chocolate is smooth and creamy, and the bits of chocolate give it an interesting texture. It definitely makes the endorphins flow,I feel much calmer and happier after eating one of these.This flavor was a favorite with the kids. Some of them preferred chocolate, some preferred white chocolate, but they all liked this flavor.These are a little bit of heaven on earth. I prefer the plain white chocolate, but these are a solid second. The center of these wasn't as creamy as it was with the plain white chocolate, and the bits of chocolate were more of a distraction from the smoothness for me.I did like them better than the milk chocolate, and I will definitely buy these again. They're cheaper, tastier and safer than anti-depressants.", "These were utterly fantastic and did not last long.  I wasn't going to share but people found my stash.  They were rich and creamy but didn't survive the transit super well and were a little melty.  Still delicious.", "Like all of the other Lindt chocolate truffles I've had (to date), the Stracciatella is excellent. The hard(er) white chocolate shell surrounding the creamy, soft center is hard to resist, and the little bits of real cocoa put it over the top. Once you've started to eat them, it's hard to stop yourself from getting another, and another, and then another, and so on.My only gripe with the Lindor Stracciatella truffles is that they're basically marketed as a take on cookies and cream, which is both inaccurate and totally unnecessary. I'm sure that most cookies and cream lovers would find this delightful enough, but it just lacks that cookie crunch that anything aiming to be &#34;cookies and cream&#34; really ought to have. It does add a different in texture that's not unpleasant, but a crunch it is not.That minor point aside, the Stracciatella chocolate truffles are excellent and arrived unmelted. I'm not sure I'd trust shipping them into a state like South Carolina in the middle of August (when temperatures can get to the triple digits and humidity can be high enough to wilt a corrugated box), but these looks like they'll stand up to shipping to more moderate climes nicely.", "We received these truffles and they were melted and re-solidified when I went to eat them. It wasn't hot when we received them either, so they didn't melt in our mailbox -- they could have melted en route to our house, but that would be a major packaging issue and I don't plan on ordering chocolate from Amazon again.They also tasted like big balls of frosting, if you like that kind of thing, you might enjoy these.", "I usually passed Lindt chocolates over, for some reason being sold individually at a bookstore check out made them seem like a less than desirable treat. Boy, I was missing out for years on one of the most delicious chocolate indulgences.While these white chocolate with cocoa bits aren't my personal favorite, my kids love them. They have that classic smooth outside and creamy inside, but with the bonus of crispy chocolate bits. Just enough to give them a nice texture, but not so much that it's too much.I am for sure picking these up again, plus popping one in my kids lunch bag is a happy day for them.", "These are very special and not often available. Have noticed they are often in stores just around springtime, but that might be changing as their popularity increases.They are really smooth, with a very creamy texture. A bit of nuttiness and crunchiness enhances their very unique flavor.These are very different and nice.", "This white chocolate has cocoa nips (love) in the shell and then a smooth creamy white chocolate in the center.  It is delicious.  I could probably eat the whole package in one sitting if not for that being 920 calories (a serving is 3 for 230 calories).", "Lindt is a chocolate that is known for being good but not great. If given a choice, Lindt would be down the list. However, this new chocolate truffle white chocolate is excellent.There is a rich outer layer of milk chocolate that is wrapped around a round ball of white chocolate. Now, these two chocolates together bring a smile. You have the first layer of milk chocolate on your tongue swirling it around, and then the next layer of white chocolate comes to the fore. Good enough to bring to your family, your love or your boss. These truffles will be very much appreciated, and they give the impression of someone who cares.My bag of chocolate arrived in an envelope, the red bag of Lindt Chocolate Truffle Peanut Butter was a little banged up, but the chocolates themselves were fine. Remember that old adage from a card company, &#34;When you want to send the very best ...&#34; Well, Lindt could use that adage in their ads.Recommended. prisrob 04-24-14", "\"This review will compare three different types of Lindt Lindor Truffles:Lindt Lindor Chocolate Lindor Truffles Milk ChocolateLindt Lindor Truffles Peanut Butter ChocolateLindt Lindor Truffles Stracciatella White ChocolateHere's how a tested these truffles: I put them out in a common space at my office, saw which was eaten up first, and asked my co-workers what they thought.The consensus was:The Milk Chocolate was the best, though a tad too sweet -- we felt like we needed to drink a cup of coffee after eating one to cut the sugar. (3/5)Next was the White Chocolate. Though I'm not usually a fan of \"\"white chocolate\"\" because it's not actually chocolate, the sweetness was not overpowering, but the taste rather band. (3/5)Least liked by far was the Peanut Butter which just had too much peanut better -- it was hard to taste the chocolate. (2/5)\"", "My Lindt chocolates arrived half-crushed (not really Lindt's fault), but they were still tasty.  The stracciatella flavor was interesting, but overwhelmingly tasted like white chocolate.  The chocolate part consisted of a few sprinkles of chocolate and could have been more pronounced.  I'd still eat them however!", "Lindor Truffles are yummy, so I was thrilled to see them offered in a white chocolate variety.  Wonderful taste, but the filling was very firm, almost the same consistency as the shell.  The shell had a nice little crunch with cocoa nibs.  What's a cocoa nib, you say?  I dunno myself, except it seems to be a tiny little milk chocolate crunchy bit.  Love the crunchy shell.  Wish the filling was as &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; as other Lindor Truffles.  But I still like these."], "A": [0.012429106049239635, 0.02350432239472866, 0.02484387345612049, 0.04223556071519852, 0.029999013990163803, 0.051465749740600586, 0.01840866357088089, 0.017881378531455994, 0.06683699041604996, 0.0215260349214077, 0.04423011839389801, 0.05705440789461136, 0.059576310217380524, 0.0416567288339138, 0.01620301604270935, 0.01265642512589693, 0.007900100201368332, 0.04344576597213745, 0.044179242104291916, 0.052425567060709, 0.0050290608778595924, 0.03081446886062622, 0.046623412519693375, 0.016572048887610435, 0.014175446704030037, 0.02810560166835785, 0.03822440281510353, 0.044101227074861526, 0.011948873288929462, 0.020939098671078682, 0.04795866832137108, 0.007049315143376589]}
