{"reviews": ["In my opinion, the Logitech G7 is one of the best designed mice I have ever used. Over the past 4 years, I've tried numerous other mice including its more recent relatives from Logitech (such as the G9), and have kept running back to my trusty G7.So what do I think about the G500?Let's say that my G7 has not been used since I laid palm on this new mouse. Or, in engineering terms:G500 = G7 + custom_buttons - wireless;Where do I start with the praise?1. Ergonomics==============The ergonomics of this mouse are absolutely identical to the G7. The G500 has a natural curve that fills my palm as if it were designed for me. This is a make-or-break feature for mice, and my brief flirtation with the G9 ended when I just couldn't get over its flat form factor.2. Additional Buttons=====================It adds scads of fully programmable buttons, all positioned in very easy to reach locations. They really show me how constrained I was with the single thumb button on the G7.Even more cool, the scroll wheel actually does function as three distinct buttons now. In the G7, I've had trouble with programming the scroll wheel click, left shift, and right shift to separate actions, because the mouse would invariably confuse a shift action with a scroll click. Not any more. The G500 interprets these crisply and clearly.3. Hyper Fast Scrolling=======================The free rolling scroll wheel seems to be much more improved from the G9. I can't imagine living without it any more. This is truly a programmer's best friend. I'm able to cruise through the longest of source files, stopping instantly when something catches my eye.4. SetPoint===========The current SetPoint version is way more advanced - and I absolutely love it. Button functions can be customized almost infinitely. Choices range from basic functions such as scrolling; to more advanced functions such as closing a window, pulling up an active window selector, launching a program, or showing and restoring the desktop; and to power functions such as supporting custom key strokes and macros.This is what makes this truly a programmer's dream mouse.(I hate to admit that I have spent more time configuring this thing than I normally do, and that I've loved every minute of it!)5. Aesthetics==============The design on the top of the mouse is truly attractive. Not that I spend a lot of time staring at mice, but this one looks really professional and arty, giving my G7s a serious inferiority complex.What I'm not too enamored by?1. Corded-ness==============I absolutely love the freedom that comes from owning a cordless mouse. The G7 is truly a marvel with  twin battery packs that can be exchanged so that you always have one ready to use, and with an amazing range. Being tethered cramps my style. However, if I'm going to be bound, then the G500's excellent quality cord (which has a fabric weave to it) would be the way I'd go. The jury is still out on this one though. I'd readily give up wireless for the customization, but why oh why is this an either-or?2. Weights==========I've never understood the fascination with customized weights for mice. Don't get me wrong, its a cool idea, and may be material for some users. It just doesn't do much for me. Even though I have played FPS and strategy games over marathon sessions, this was never on the top of my wish list.I simply got my G500 to weigh as close to my G7 as I could and I was done.3. The new position of the DPI buttons=======================================I'm okay with having to launch SetPoint to change the DPI, so I normally reprogram these buttons to more useful functions. However, the G500 moves these buttons to the head of the mouse, making them awkward to use. I personally would have preferred having these moved down to the right edge.Conclusion==========I absolutely love this mouse.In my opinion this is the absolute best mouse currently available for right handers, with large hands, who prefer to cup, rather than claw, their mice.I'd have preferred a cordless version, but this mouse is a wonderful next step along the transformation path of the lowly point-and-click device, into a multipurpose swiss-army-knife type tool.This is a worthwhile replacement for a G7. However, if you currently use a G9, you might want to check out the G9X instead. I found the ergonomics of the G9/G9X to be vastly different to the G7/G500.Happy Mousing!", "Right out of the package, you can tell this is a high-quality mouse. Logitech has really outdone themselves this time. The mouse is customizable in several ways, including a set of small weights that are included so you can set the mouse to feel as heavy or as light as you want it to. It's formed for you hand (if you're right-handed) and has six extra buttons on it that are programmable for any online gaming or just browsing that you want. And the settings are stored in the mouse itself, so you can take it with you from desktop to laptop and it will work the same. Even the cord is wonderfully durable covered with tightly-woven material rather than just rubber sitting out there. The wheel glides smoothly as well, and you'll probably find yourself overshooting the mark if you just spin it to scroll down a document or web page. This is a gaming mouse first and foremost, but it's perfect for everyday use as well. You'll be spoiled by the quality of this one! Highly recommended!", "\"Logitech is one of those brands where you know you're getting a good product regardless of what you buy.  This mouse continues and builds on that trend.  It's easily the best mouse I've ever used, and a lot cheaper than most of the mice I've used too!! Plug it in and it works immediately, on a PC or a Mac.  Many buttons that are programmable, and onboard memory so you can use the same settings on every computer rather than having to set them manually every time you plug the mouse into a different computer.  If you're a gamer, you won't find a better gaming mouse.  Heck, even if you're just a casual PC user I'd recommend the mouse because of the fairly low price, and the great quality/comfort of the mouse.  My favorite feature is how you can press a button to change the scroll when to either \"\"clicky\"\" mode or \"\"smooth\"\" mode.An excellent mouse.  Do yourself a favor and invest, you won't be disappointed.\"", "So far this is the best mouse I've ever owned.  I came from a Logitech MX518 which is also a fantastic mouse but I needed more buttons and control and this mouse gives it in spaces and looks great too.  Highly recommended for gamers or casual users alike!", "\"After using the Logitech G5 for over 3 years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. The only two possibilities from Logitech were the G9x and the G500. I decided to go with the latter since it includes all the advanced features of G9x, while retaining the perfect G5 shape.Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in precision between this one and the G5, since both are extremely accurate. The G500 however, includes some features not found on the G5:- internal memory (for 1 profile, think)- dual mode scroll wheel (smooth and notched. Smooth mode is low friction rotation but useless for gaming.)- 2 extra buttons (2 extra buttons over the red G5, and 1 extra button over the blue G5)- full macro support (I don't know why this feature wasn't on the G5...)- higher DPI (5700 dpi, but I keep my max at 2000.)It feels exactly like the G5 when holding, and that's its strongest point IMO. The wheel is a little worse, as it's too sensitive (ie, sometimes you end up scrolling four \"\"notches\"\" when you only want to scroll three) but not so much that it makes me want to go back to the G5. I'll get used to it I guess. Otherwise, I absolutely love it. If you are a G5 user and need to upgrade, then the G500 is what you are looking for.Update: After using it for many weeks now, I now love the sensitive wheel. I guess my finger was used to the tight G5 wheel, but I got used to this new one in no time. Absolutely loving this mouse so far.\"", "About three weeks ago I decided to buy a gaming desktop.  With no knowledge of desktop gaming peripherals I searched Amazon to try and find an awesome gaming mouse.  You'll never guess which one I decided to invest in.  What?  This one?  Well you guessed right.  This mouse makes me happy in all the right ways.Pros:-Fully customizable buttons-Easy to use software for changing mouse options-Placement of buttons is perfect-Good Logitech qualityCons:-The weights that come with the mouse barely change the overall weight-The wheel buttons is a little difficult to push (I end up rarely using it due to this)In conclusion, I was quite satisfied with my purchase.  There could be better mice out there but this one gets the job done for me at a decent price.", "Logitech keeps churning out one good mouse after another. Lot of people think the default cheap mouse that comes with the PC is enough and these ones are meant for gamers. Give it a try, it is well worth every penny you spend on these. I love how the mouse wheel feels, browsing and every day chores becomes a pleasant experience. I love the build and extra weights that comes with the mouse. It will never feel out of place. The bottom surface is made on non electrostatic plastic, it wont accumulate dirt and dust like other cheap mouses that OEMs provide. It is always accurate and fast.Now with the gaming season at peak, it does every thing you want to build and maintain your edge. The mouse can be pre-scripted easiy. Sensitivity can be adjusted on the fly. It does every thing listed and does it perfectly. As logitech as done this several times they have all the required features. Most of the questions are surrounding the effectiveness and reliability. Another good news is Windows7 support. Works like a breeze with all the OSes I have tested. Linux, Windows7, Windows XP.. Fantastic work logitech. Keep the good mouses cumming.", "As an owner of the G9x mouse I always thought the even tough that mouse is great didn't deserve the place as best gaming mouse ever. I tried the G500 and felt a instant improvement in ergonomics as in the performance as well. I bought the G500 only because of the great ergonomics feature but had second thoughts about if being actually better in gaming performance as the G9x. To my surprise the G500 is even more responsive than the G9x and runs smoother. The G500 is a great every day mouse AND also a great specialized gaming mouse. The best of BOTH WORLDS.", "This mouse is perfect for productivity and gaming.  It's easy to create profiles and associate them with different applications.  Logitech provides software (download the latest version from the web site - don't use the disk, though) for easily creating macros.  You can also program scripts.  DPI range 200 to 5700 is great.  You specify DPI settings and save them with the application profiles.  Great for Photoshop because you can lower the DPI for precision work. Great for FPSs because you can lower your DPI on the fly for lining up your shots.  You can raise the DPI on the fly for quick navigation or less precise movements.  You set the number of levels of DPI and the DPI at each level in the Logitech software.  The DPI switching buttons are perfectly placed - just out of the way but easily accessible at the left edge of the left mouse button.It has a sort of rough texture, so it won't slip out of your hand while gaming.  It's definitely a different feel, but you get used to it and appreciate it in no time.I also like the ability to switch the feel of the scroll-wheel.At first, I loaded this thing up with the weights so I'd get rid of light-touch jerky movements, but after a few days, I removed all the weights.  It's nice to have the option to customize the feel of the mouse in this way, though.  I may experiment with them a little more over time, but right now I want to game.The only thing I'd change for any gaming mouse is to make the right mouse button require more force for the click (FPS bias).  When I'm surprised during a game such as MOH, I find myself mistakenly hitting the right button while pressing the left and I'm not pushing hard.  Happens when strafing while shooting as well, since the mouse is in motion.  The right mouse button could use a little more resistance in my opinion, since it is usually reserved as the zoom-in function and used less often than the left.I have large hands.  I don't claw.  I rest the pads under the base knuckles of my index and middle fingers on the back end of the mouse.  I use thumb and ring fingers for precise movements.  The ergonomics are great for this.Another great thing is it works just fine in Windows 7 64-bit and there are 64-bit drivers on the Logitech web site.  A lot of game controllers (keypads or mice) have issues with Windows 7.  This product does not.The mouse itself is solid and I'm impressed with it so far.", "I had high hopes for this mouse but overall was very disappointed.  The mouse feels great and I really like the different weights you can add to change the feel.  I also like how you can adjust the sensitivity on the mouse depending on your needs.  BUT - The SetPoint software that you use to customize the mouse and set macros for each of the buttons is next to worthless.  There is very little in the way of documentation and the Logitech web site is not much better.  The software is just not intuitive to use.  You have to go to multiple screens to set profiles for different applications and to set macros for each of the buttons.  I am a very technical person (MCSE), so I can't imagine someone who is not technical being able to make it through the setup of macros.  In the end, I could not get the macros to work at all in any of the programs I tried:  Photoshop Elements 9, World of Warcraft, etc.  I went on the Logitech forums and they were no help.  I have a very standard Windows 7 system and downloaded the latest software from the Logitech website.  I tried multiple different configurations... Installed, uninstalled, and installed again.  No Go.  So, luckily I purchased this at Best Buy and the return process will be easy.", "\"My last mouse wasMicrosoft's Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000. It was very ergonomic, but it had a number of shortfalls that finally added up and it was time to replace it. So, when I decided that I needed a new mouse, what I did not like about my old mouse sure weighted a lot in making my final choice.IF TRUTH BE TOLD, PC GAMING CAN ONLY MEAN A WIRED MOUSEMy old (wireless) mouse could loose its connection (and was then slow in responding or turned unresponsive until reset) if the receiver was not in direct visual contact with it. Moreover, there are a lot of negative reviews about rechargeable mice (such as theG700), so my next mouse could only be a wired one.The G500 comes with an ample length of sturdy yet flexible USB cord - and the fact that it is also braided is a nice touch. Plug it in and forget about it for as long as you keep using it. No batteries to replace or recharge, no receiver to keep changing position. Technology is supposed to make our lives simpler, right?ERGONOMICS GET A B+I was used to the much taller MS mouse so the G500 feels too flat. That may be a matter of preference and something one has to get used to. However, with my old MS mouse the angle my wrist was resting at felt much more natural and my wrist was much less strained after some hours of computer use. Apparently Logitech addressed this in its latest G700.Another issue I am having with the G500 is the BACK side-button which I keep hitting whenever I move the mouse to the right. I did find a partial solution to this by varying the weights and selecting the lighter ones for the left side (although the same can be achieved by completely removing the weight tray).Having said that, the wheel-release and the DPI-level buttons are perfectly placed. Also, the two settings for the scroll-wheel are a very nice feature.AESTHETICSI like the way the red DPI-level lights and the scrolling wheel look as well as the texture of the braided cord.On the other hand, the actual back surface looks nothing like the metallic looking one in the product description picture! It is plastic and its looks exactly that. I would also preferred it to be solid black instead of the two-tone sprinkled gray (again, something remedied in the G700).ENGINEERED WEAK POINTS?This is something I came to realize over the years: companies now seem to actually engineer weak points into their products, to ensure their replacement some time down the road. With my old MS mouse it was the silicone-based surfaces that would become impossible to clean after 12-16 months. The G500 has solid plastic surfaces that may not be the most pleasant thing to touch but they are easy to clean.Some fellow reviewers complain about the durability of the scroll-wheel, so this may be it. After about a couple of months of use I had no problems whatsoever - but I promise to update this point of my review if similar problems occur.DIVERT ALL NON-ESSENTIAL POWER TO THE PORT-SIDE LASERS!The G500 is equipped with a \"\"gaming-grade laser\"\" (I do not know what that is, however, my MS mouse used to cause the cursor to drift for no reason whereas my G500 is solid like a rock) and it has a DPI range from 200 to 5700. The DPI setting can be adjusted on the fly. This is important because the mouse is programmable and can be customized into numerous Profiles (via its software) but it can only store one profile at a time. No matter, adjusting the DPI is what makes all the difference in the world.THREE IMPORTANT THINGS: SOFTWARE, SOFTWARE, SOFTWAREThis is where the G500 redeems most of its shortcomings: the accompanying software works like a charm.Anyone who ever used a MS mouse can tell you this: the IntelliPoint software that comes with it is a pain to use and a hassle to avoid conflicts with. Using the LOGITECH SetPoint instead was a breeze of fresh air!Within a pleasant yet not fancy visual interface, simple and clear adjustments can be made to customize the mouse to your needs.Overall, although not perfect, this may be the best mouse available to gamers today. Its in-house competition, the G700, does come with better ergonomics and a more pleasant color but wireless technology and rechargeable batteries do not seem just ready yet.RECOMMENDED!\"", "I had a G7 mouse back in the day and I loved it and I was sad to see it go.  So I wanted somthing like it and this is what I found.PROS:- Feels like a G7- Fits my hand very comfortably- Good Price- Perfect for Gaming or web browseing- Simple DPI programmingCONS:- Doesn't Make You Coffee but I won't knock down a star for that.", "\"I didn't know it was possible to love a mouse this much!One of the reasons I keep coming back to Logitech as a company, is because unlike certain other companies who shall remain nameless (but not blameless), Logitech keeps making REAL efforts to improve their products every generation.  Sure, some of their ideas don't pan out well (hi track balls!) but when they figure out they have a bad idea, they tend to tweak it, or pull it.I am a proud owner of almost the entire history of mice from Logitech, dating back to their simple green and black mice with no names from the 1990's, to their MX 510 and MX 518 \"\"gaming mice\"\" to their G5 \"\"gaming mouse\"\" and now this one.All of the \"\"gaming mice\"\" had adjustable sensitivity levels.  The G5 and the G500 also have adjustable weights.  What the G5 had, which the MX series didn't have, was the rugged cord (which was also longer, which was quite nice), and the weights.  What the G500 has, which the G5 didn't have, is on-board memory, programmable macros for sensitivity, and the new easy glide wheel.  I think it is the wheel which I love the most.  You can click it back and forth between super-fast glide mode, and the more traditional \"\"clicky\"\" mode, which is slower.  It will also increase/decrease speed, depending on what resolution you have it in.Another bonus over the G5 that the G500 has, is that EVERYTHING works right out of the box, WITHOUT software.  Since I am not the type of user who will EVER be programming my mouse, or storing macros in it, I LOVE that!  I actually had problems with the G5 that I ended up having to contact their customer support about, due to the \"\"back\"\" thumb button not working properly (it only worked in certain contexts).  The G500, however, has none of those problems.  They also got rid of my other major complaint about the G5, namely the overly sensitive right mouse button which was always getting accidentally clicked when you held the mouse in any way other than a very specific way I guess the G5 designer assumed everyone would hold it (read: not naturally).  They have changed the angle a bit in the G500 to eliminate that, and also made the click slightly less easy to happen on that button.To top it off, the annoying rough texturing from the G5 has been moved to just the lower portion where your palm is, and where your thumb is.  It is back to smooth for your fingers, and the mottled gray and back looks very nice too.Overall, 5 star product, I love it!  Well worth the money!  I paid more than they are asking now for this model, when I picked up my G5 model.\"", "I purchased this one on recommendation from another avid gamer that owns several servers but (and I hate to say it) I mistakenly thought he meant the G500 when he really meant the G9X. So to be fair to all concerned I will give it a five star. I did eventually return this one and get the G9X and am really happy with it.", "\"This logitech mouse works very well, especially for gaming. As a gaming mouse, it has excellent weight, great tracking, responsive buttons and excellent ergonomics. I can play WoW for hours without much discomfort. I really like the \"\"heftiness\"\" of the scroll wheel too. A great mouse. Would buy again.\"", "\"I used to own a G5 and for five lovely years it was my favorite weapon and I loved it like Zaeed loved Jessie in Mass Effect 2. It was still in prime shape (and let me remind, it withstood FIVE YEARS of NONSTOP ACTION) but I was getting worried that someday I would not be able to buy a G5 anymore. I made the decision to try the G500 despite being very skeptical about it's 3 crowded and small looking side buttons and strange shape and if I really didn't like it I would buy a G5 while I still could and save it for later. So I bought the G500 and tried it out.Right when I put my hand on it I knew I was completely wrong. It felt like bliss in a mouse. The side buttons that I was so scared of being too small were easy to press and pressing two or three of them on accident was not a concern due to the superb design. The sensitivity buttons are now placed so that you index finger merely needs to move to the side instead of curling up for much easier access. The drivers are fantastic, easily letting you customize you buttons to do just about everything you could imagine. The onboard memory is very convenient for going to LAN cafes. Everything that I wanted from the G5 was there, with fantastic improvements.That being said however, the mouse isn't perfect. The fantastic ergonomic design is a little TOO comfortable, and what I mean by this is that it's more difficult to pick up the mouse because of the lacking ridge on the right side. I have to move my ring finger over to the side to pick it up easier but then it's very crowded and harder to move. The mouse wheel feel very loose compared to the G5 and does not protrude as much. I'm guessing it's loose because of the option for smooth scrolling which I never use and can't imagine is too popular. It would be nice if the onboard memory could hold more than one profile. I just can't imagine having a bigger onboard memory would be too expensive, but I might be wrong. A mouse with this many buttons is very nice to have with many profiles. Lastly, the mice feet that come standard with this mouse are horrible. They should consider using the same feet as Hyperglide or Razer products. I use Hyperglide and it is DEFINITELY worth the purchase!The last thing I want to leave off with is that there are a lot of gamers who look at the new mice in the market today with scorn due to the laser tracking. I want to mention that as long as you are using a proper mousepad (black), there should be NO problem with tracking and those absurd ESReality mouse \"\"benchmarks\"\" measure at speeds far too unrealistic to be of any use. I have tried out a lot of different mice (mainly Razer, Logitech and Microsoft) but of all of them, my G5 laser has been the most reliable. I have never noticed skipping or difficulty aiming and I am a low DPI gamer. So far, my G500 has followed suite.In the end, the right mouse for a person should mainly depend on it's shape. If you are a fan of the MX518 and the G5, the G500 is definitely worth a try!\"", "\"I own many Razer mouses and I give away/recommend to friends a lot. I thought \"\"game's choice\"\" means highest quality but I was probably wrong. Even a flagship mouse fails me twice and I finally decides to try other brands. Come back to old friend Logitech.First of all, I have sort of medium hand. Logitech G500 is a amazing mouse.Things I like:- All the buttons are customizable.- Switchable wheel. Smooth and click-to-click.- Buttons are placed in right places where easy to reach.- sensitive indicator on the mouse. Using + and - buttons on the mouse can adjust sensitive level in no time.- Wired.- Precise & Adjustable weight.- Surface. It's anti-fingerprint surface with a little rough feel.Thing I don't like:- Wheel. Personally I prefer click-to-click style but it has very weak clicks.- Painting. Prefer solid colors.- Ergonomically, it could be too big for people who like claw style mouse.- The software(for adjusting buttons etc) bugs me sometimes. Just don't like extra resources are used by mouse.Thank you for reading. Hope it helps.\"", "\"I really like this mouse. It has a nice solid feel, and I put the max weight that I could into it. Feels great, solid buttons, and the DPI thing is pretty nifty, I can turn it down when working on my audio program to do precise edits, and then urn it up to navigate quickly through things. Gaming wise, it's still a great mouse. I also really love the braided cable wrap. Don't use this with the razer cable bungee, as the bungee WILL destroy the wrap.UPDATE: I just wanted to update this review, as i purchased a razer mamba 2012 to replace this. That was a big mistake. I figured, hey, razer is a gaming company for gamers, its gotta be good stuff. Waste of money. This mouse is still the best feeling, and most responsive mouse i have owned. I also didnt know that i REALLY liked that there are NO GROOVES around the fingers that build up that \"\"finger gunk\"\" when being used a lot. The mamba did that, and I hate that!I would still recommend this mouse to anyone who wants a gaming mouse.\""], "A": [0.008390923961997032, 0.009045436047017574, 0.027619581669569016, 0.01902911625802517, 0.18542534112930298, 0.021904675289988518, 0.0031665267888456583, 0.13487392663955688, 0.0006366127054207027, 0.02061757631599903, 0.03784216195344925, 0.0889529213309288, 0.00023791633429937065, 0.2112429440021515, 0.015378789976239204, 0.04991603270173073, 0.01312694326043129, 0.1525925099849701]}
