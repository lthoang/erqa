Great drive!", "I used 4 of theses drives in my Thecus n4100Pro.  I had a RAID 5 setup and they worked great.  The speed was a little slower than I would have liked but they had a lot of space and were cheap.", "\"When I purchased my one terabyte drive for my \"\"dream machine\"\", I planned to add it to the 500gb Western Digital drive. I wanted to use the 500gb for Windows Vista and my programs and the one terabyte for my data files. The idea was sound and the solution proved to be perfect. One thing to be aware of though is that this is OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and contains no hardware or instructions. I would not attempt to install it myself. I took it to my computer shop with a trusted computer geek and he performed the task. I've been very pleased with Western Digital drives... why would I want something that would die on me after a few months or even years. You'll save money with this OEM drive but if you are unsure about installing it, spend a few bucks more and have it professionally installed.\"", "It is easy to figure out and install, if you have a mac;  It runs fast and quiet, - reminds me of some nature sound. There were no problems formatting or partitioning as desired. Recommended.", "I did not read the description well and missed the fact it is 5400 rpm. The drive works well but is slow.", "\"First I tried a WD black to replace my HP All in one PC hard drive and while fast is was very loud, my wife said it must go. I agreed. In goes th green, and this this is SILENT. A hair slower, but all around a perfect fit for an \"\"All in one\"\" PC with no real case and general home use. It also runs drastically cooler than the black drive.If you have a small case, use the Green drive so you dont hear it working and know it wont heat things up inside the limited air space \"\"case\"\". If you have a large case, the black is where its at cause you'll probably never hear it and you have the air flow to cool it.Both drives are leaps and bounds better the Seagate drives! Seagate is the ONLY brand to fail me in over 20 years of working with multiple PC's. Even when I ran a PC repair business for 5 years, I never saw a WD drive actually fail to at least retrive data. Seagate got 3 strikes and now their out!\"", "\"I bought this hard drive for the purpose of expanding storage of myAcer Aspire AH340-UA230N Home Server. As it seems to be the only operating system that there have been no reviews for, I was a bit hesitant to purchase it. However, I have had no issues with this drive. Acer home server makes it very easy to install additional hard drive with front HD bays that are easy to open and require no additional cables. The hard drive was immediately recognized by the operating system, and it took very short time for it to be formated and made available for general use. The hard drive is quiet and thus far very reliable. I can't comment on how \"\"green\"\" it is, but I have not noticed any significant increase in the power consumption nor in the amount of heat that is emitted by the home server.Just a couple of words of caution: this hard drive is packaged in a bare-bones package, and comes with no instructions or other information. If you have never installed an internal hard drive, you may want to get some information online about what is the best way of doing it for your compute.\"", "Avoid these drives like plague as they have high failure rate. I have two of them and one failed in less that 12 months with 750MB data on it after using only for backups.Luckily the drive was under warranty, but WD requires customer to pay for shipping to replace their defective product. To add insult to injury the replacement was a refurbished drive which I fully expect fail even sooner than the brand new one.Do not be swayed by the low price of these drives as you will have to buy two and back often. Also save your coins for shipping charges and pray drive fails within warranty period otherway you are left with a heavy paperweight. I also have a failed 160GB version of WD drive.Western Digital Caviar Black 1 TB Desktop Hard Drive (WD1002FAEX)", "This drive is a green drive, which means lower power consumption. If you plan to build a RAID, the drive manufacture would tell you not use green drive for RAID.However, I built two RAID using green drives and they all working fine.  The problem with green drive and RAID is that if the drive went to sleep, it might lose data.  I used LSI RAID card and green drives from different manufactures, WD, Seagate, and Samsung mixed to build the RAID. Running for almost a year now without any problem.  I think mix different brands in the RAID may help the drive not going into sleep.I like this drive, reliable, quite, use less power than those 10000RPM drives.", "mirrored two of these and have yet to see any failure. love western digital, and will continue to use them.", "Interesting that amazon is the only place on the planet that advertises this drive at 7200 rpm. Everywhere else it's a 5400. And you have to really dig for the specs no matter where you look.", "I use this as a backup drive for my iMac.  I use it with a dock so I can switch out drives.  Overall the noise level is much lower than my Seagate drive and the speed is reasonable.  The unit was packed very well and I feel comfortable shipping data on drives in this packaging.  Since the price is reasonable and it seems to be reliable I would purchase this again.", "I bought this to install XP with sp1, set jumpers to pin 7 and 8, and the moment i started installing system drivers, rebooted the HD (hard drive) went wacko on me (blue screen) with unmountable boot volume, so i did the XP recovery,did chkdsk /r, no good, did fixboot (restart first) no good and a few others no good, all i did was waste tons of my saturday playing with this drive with XP ... not sure how good this is on windows 7, but for XP i would try to avoid it and buy the cheaper barracuda drive instead.update : works great on win7 (avoid on XP), bought 2 more of this green HDD...", "\"The drive is wrapped in a snug fitting anti-static bag. Then, it's mounted inside snug fitting \"\"bookends\"\".  Basically, it's an injection molded foot on each end of the drive that keeps it suspended in the air.  This GREATLY reduces packaging, but still provides tremendous protection against high-G shocks, such as UPS handling.The product box was put inside a slightly larger box with an air pillow.  I guess they needed a second layer to protect against moisture or puncture, but that seemed a waste.  The internal box would have been sufficient had it been taped and labelled for shipping.The drive itself is pretty standard for WD.  It's lower power, lower performance, bulk storage.  It's SATA, with command queueing, and a decent cache.  That handles having a program running on it, plus bulk storage.  This is exactly perfect for the design and capacity.If you think you'll make a RAID5 and run 5 active VMs on it, you're sorely mistaken.  IOPS on this large drive is lower per GB than smaller drives, than SCSI drives, etc.  Cache per GB is lower, even with the big cache.  Also, RAID5 will cut your IOPS by a factor of about 3.5.  If you want high performance, then use several smaller drives with 64MB buffers, higher speeds, and maybe even a smaller spindle, slapped into a RAID1+0 array.If you want something to store a boat load of data economically and with lower power consumption, then this drive is what I would recommend.UPDATE: I have this on Windows 2003 R2 as bulk storage.  Initially, it seemed stable, but after 3 months, I started getting \"\"Delayed Write Failure\"\" and the device would go offline.  Now, this happens about every 2 days.I thought maybe I needed to run the alignment tool; however, WD won't let me download it.  One is a clone tool which will not install in 2003 because it's a server operating system.  The other cannot be downloaded without registering with serial number.  There's no easy tool to pull serial number from the disk while it's installed.  The software didn't come with the disk.Basically, WD has made it very difficult troubleshoot this device because their custom software isn't readily available.I had similar issues with their 3GB MyBook USB3 drive, where it would go offline daily on both my Linux and 2003 system.  I'm not sure what WD's problem is, but my supposition is that to meet their \"\"green\"\" claims, they're forcibly making the drive(s) go offline.Regardless of what's actually occurring, WD has lost credibility with me because of their green drives.  A drive should work like a drive, and any custom performance software should be optional, not a requirement.  Spinning disk should just magically work without any special 100MB enablement software.  Etc etc etc.\"", "This drive is a fantastic time machine backup drive.  It's quiet and stays cool.  Disc access seems speedy also.  I have used a number of these drives and have been very happy with them all. I recommend the Cav Greens.", "WD is a good quality drive manufacturer with a good rating for longevity (in my opinion). I have order dozens of these drives and the last order had one (1) of the two (2) DOA. It happens. As with all online orders, if it's mission critical always buy two. You can always use a spare or return it once you are up and running. At this cost, just mirror the drives and save headache in the long term.", "\"I have never had a hard drive fail on me, nor know any friends or family members who've had a hard drive failure. So I was very surprised when windows came up with an error about this drive failing. I had it installed as a secondary drive for more storage space, and thankfully did not have my windows OS installed on it. I hardly used it for the 3 months I had it, only putting about 200GB worth of data onto it.It failed shortly after moving a 7gb folder onto it.

The 5400 rpm seek speed limits it's performance but it is a very large capacity drive.  Would be good for mass storage", "I purchased this drive to replace the drive in my Wife's computer that was running out of space. The PC was running Windows 7 and the drive being replaced was a WD3200KS 7200RPM drive.PC the drive went into: Stock Intel Q6600, Gigabyte GA-EP45-D3SL, 8GB DDR2, and a ATI HD4870.The Windows install wasn't that old and I didn't really want to mess with getting her all her stuff back so I used a Clonezilla Live CD to clone the old drive to the new one. I then booted straight into Windows 7 off the new drive. Windows asked me to restart so I did and the system was up and running without incident. I then went into the Windows 7 disk manager and extended the partition to fill the whole drive.Knowing this was an Advanced Format drive but unsure if the alignment would be correct due to the cloning, I downloaded the bootable image for the align utility from the Western Digital site and burned it to a CD. I ran the utility and it indicated that the partition was aligned correctly and there was nothing that needed to be done.The old drive showed as a 5.4 and the new one as a 5.9 on the Windows Experience Index. I didn't think that was too bad coming from an older 7200 RPM drive to this. I was a little worried it would be slower but that isn't the case. I haven't personally used the PC enough myself to know but my wife says she notices it is a bit faster and things are quicker to load.This drive for me was a worthwhile upgrade and money well spent to this point. Only time will tell about the reliability as with any drive.", "A bit slow compared to a Raptor, but good enough for general purpose storage.  I don't care about the junk science of man-made global warming.  I do care that this style of drive doesn't reject as much heat into my system as faster drives do.  This makes everything last longer.", "\"THE QUICK TAKE:  The WD10EARS is a new (shipping 12-2009) version of Western Digital's popular and successfulWDxxEADS Caviar Green seriesof drives.  It's a very good drive, but may need more thought than usual about whether it's the right drive for you.The Caviar Green drives offer low power consumption, low noise and moderate operating temperatures, while still maintaining performace good enough for many applications, such as networked storage.  This new WDxxEARS series uses more dense 500GB platters - so a 1TB drive has just two platters, and several drives up to 2TB are available.  The new models have 64MB of cache.ADVANCED FORMAT:  There's another change as well.  WD is using this series to transition to 4KB sectors on the hard drive; they call it WD Advanced Format technology.  The long-term goal is to improve the efficiency of large hard drives, but as a transitional move they still trying to accomodate the 512B sectors that Windows XP uses.  So the drive emulates that, using 512B logical sectors.  However, they still claim that Advanced Format provides an improvement in burst speeds.ISSUES WITH XP:  While that sounds like all good news, it turns out that many XP users need to use the WD Align software to setup the drive, which can be time consuming and create some potential issues in formatting and partitioning the drive, and in finding tools to do that.The exception is if you are using a single partition for a clean install - then there is an option to set a jumper on the drive before installing.  WD has a table which summarizes installation at their \"\"Advanced Format Hard Drive Download Utility\"\" web page - anyone buying this drive should be sure to review that page.So less technical users may want to believe WD when they say \"\"WD Advanced Format drives are specifically optimized for Mac and the latest Windows operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7.\"\" This drive might not a good choice for some XP users - you'll be fine with the tried and true EADS series.VISTA AND WINDOWS 7:  Further, cloning and partitioning tools might present issues with Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well.  You can read more about the AF transition at the WD web page mentioned above in the AnandTech article, \"\"Western Digital's Advanced Format: The 4K Sector Transition Begins.\"\"  They note that as of 12-2009 there might not be any commercially available cloning and imaging tools that would work with these drives.LINUX AND MAC:  The Anandtech article also states that current versions of Linux and Mac OS X are not affected by issues with Advanced Format, but discussions online suggest that Linux users seem to face some complexities on how to best partition and format to avoid mis-alignment.OTHER INFO:  The WD site has a good whitepaper on Advanced Format. Tom's Hardware has a good discussion about the earlier EADS series in an article entitled \"\"Caviar Green, WD10EADS, And 1 TB,\"\" with power and performance info; and some interesting points if you Google \"\"Pros And Cons Of Going Green.\"\"\"", "Ah, I searched and searched for a replacement hard drive for my Tivo HD and cam across this drive.
