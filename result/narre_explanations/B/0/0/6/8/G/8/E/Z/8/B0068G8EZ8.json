{"reviews": ["As I'm typing these, I have one of these strips on me, removing the blackheads on my nose. I've been a fan of Biore nose strips for the last decade or so, since they invented them. There have been many copycats from a variety of different companies, but Biore has managed to always make the exfoliation process much more thorough and to make the redness afterward disappear a lot quicker.I have sensitive skin and I do well with these strips, much  better than with a lot of creams, lotions, and/or potions.I enjoy seeing the copious amounts of blackheads that remain on the strip after it is removed (once your skin starts to feel like it has paper-mache on it, wait for 30 seconds then remove, wash with a cleanser right afterward for longer lasting clean skin).I've had acne in my T-zone area as a teenager and I enjoyed taking care of the blackheads with Biore strips then. Now, it's merely a mild inconvenience, but I still like to make sure that my skin is super exfoliated and blackhead-free prior to big events.One piece of advice: Make sure to follow the directions and not to use the strips on areas that have other types of pimples than blackheads - the irritation afterward isn't worth it.", "I don't know why it's fun to peel these things off your face, but I know a lot of people agree that it is.  You just sort of feel cleaner even if you don't see a different.  Yeah, there are little spikey things sticking up, but is that stuff that was in your pores before or just part of the product in action?  Weirdly satisfying either way.", "My nose has been covered with blackheads for years, and this product does seem to clear it up every time I use it.  I'm sticking with the every three days recommendation that is on the box and I'm noticing a difference in the number of blackheads and such on my nose.  It is actually starting to look clear now and it never has before.", "\"If you have sensitive skin, beware: this product runs the risk of peeling off a layer of skin along with the blackheads in your nose and face. If you're this type of person, I recommend using a liquid version of the pore strip. I know that the Body Shop has a tea tree item that does this, although I stopped using it because it didn't grip hard enough to get everything. It's perfect for people with very sensitive skin, which is what I'd recommend as a good alternative.That said, if you have non-sensitive skin and a ton of blackheads, this is a great item to try out. It'd been a long while since I'd used the deep cleaning pore strips from Biore, so I decided to give this a try to see what they've done differently. I'd stuck mostly to the normal strips as those worked well, but had good memories of the deep cleansing strips.Ugh. I'd take a picture of what this pulled out of my face, but I don't want to scar you guys. Let's just say that I pulled out enough to where I wanted to go cry in a closet and scream \"\"Sanctuary!\"\" because I felt like I'd been walking around like Quasimodo with a set of really bad pores. I do have an issue with large pores, but I'd felt like my other stuff had been dealing well enough with it. This stuff is freaking awesome and I can't wait until enough time has passed to where I can use it again without doing any harm to my skin.The only downfall is that if you aren't careful, you'll end up with the pore strip equivalent of super glue on your nose, chin, or wherever you plan on using this. Time the strips very carefully and make sure that you have a high pain tolerance. This might seem like common sense, as you're pulling the equivalent of cosmetic fashion tape off of your face, but this stuff hurts. Other than that, I wish that there was a way to keep this stuff from leaving so much residue on your face afterwards. Yes, you should be washing your face afterwards, but this stuff leaves quite a bit in the sides of your nose and around the general area of the pore strip. Nothing major that I'd say would stop me from using the strip, though.\"", "I have been using the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips for quite some time now. And I love them. They are super simple to use, and work! After a few minutes, my pores are cleaned out and my face feels fresh.", "I hadn't used these little strips in a while, so I thought I'd give them another try. While they do seem to unclog some pores, I think one of the things they mainly do it pull out small hairs, which wasn't my goal. They also left a residue that was not easy to get off. While it's probably a helpful product for many, for me the expense is not worth it.", "It's been years, but I used to be a faithful user of the pore strips and I have no idea why I stopped - I didn't realize they were still around. This package came with a combo of facial strips and nose strips, and is very easy to use. Wet the area you want, and just apply the strip over it and let dry for 15 or so minutes and then pull them off. If your pores are really clogged, look at what comes off with the strip for a *eewww* factor :)Rinse and moisturize and you're all done.", "\"I could see that some of the \"\"junk\"\" *was* removed from clogged pores, but it hurt when I removed the strip from my nose and my nose was red.  I am not sure if this time of year was just a bad time to try it, because we're having some really cold weather in the Northeast and my skin has dry patches.  However, it did pull a little bit of dead skin.  I could tell this because my skin felt extremely soft and smooth afterwards.Look at the other reviews too.  I did not have the best experience, but if I were you, I would not base your decision (whether to purchase) on my review alone.\"", "Is it bad that I think these are fun?! A guilty pleasure of mine would be to face a mirror and pull out black heads from my pores, sometimes for hours on end. Of course, I never got them all and I could feel them as I ran my hand across my face.As soon as I got the box I read the instructions (wet your face, don't dry, and apply!) and slapped on three pore strips; two regular strips (one on my forehead, one on my chin) and the nose strip. I sat for the required fifteen minutes and felt the strips go from wet and flexible to almost rock hard.When the fifteen minutes was up I removed the strips and found a forest of ickiness! My face felt so much better, cleaner and softer! I can definitely see a difference in my complexion and enjoy the feeling it gives me.I reduced the strips to 4 stars because it is almost impossible to get the strips to adhere behind the nostrils where the angle is the sharpest, even while holding them in place. If this area of the face didn't collect so much junk it wouldn't be an issue, but some of the grimiest places on my face are located in this spot.", "Like another reviewer, we alsways used Biore but last time we ran out, we never replenished.  Using this product reminded us why we love their products.  Plain and simple, it works.The strip is very simple to use. However, I highly recommend you time use and not exceed recommended times, especially for sensitive skin. The new ingredients are stronger than previous versions.  Almost like superglue. The new design, which provides slits, allows from a much better fit than previous versions. Though some residue will be left behind, we found it easily washed off (which you should be doing anyway).All in all, it's a clear winner. I knocked one star off the review because the new ingredients can cause injury if left applied for too long.  It's that strong.", "And by scary, I mean it is scary how much junk these things can pull out of your skin.I was always weary of any product that is supposed to be able to pull dirt out of your skin, especially since I have had oily skin my whole life and have battled blackheads since my teenage years.But this product does what it claims.  You wash your face like you normally would, then apply the strips on your nose and/or forehead as described in the instructions.  Let the strips dry and when you slowly peel them off attatched to the strip is all these little dots and blobs of gunk and junk that had been stuck in your pores!Now after you do this your skin in these areas may be excessively dry because you basically emptied your pores out.  But with careful regular use I saw improved skin condition in my problem areas and a virtual end to black heads.My only major complaints were that I have a rather large nose and I don't get as much coverage from the nose strip as I would like.  Maybe if they offered a large size option?  But that is just me.  Also I wish I could get this product to work on some trouble spots near my chin, but I have had no success with that.If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.", "This is actually one of my favorite products. I've tried all of the HOMEMADE versions on Pinterest and the internet and they just don't compare. You need to get the Biore ones. They are worth the money and they work really well. I wish they had a whole face version!", "When they first arrived on the scene, I remember buying these, and not being crazy about them. They were messy, and if the water ratio wasn't exactly perfect or you removed the strip a second too soon or late, it did nothing.Have they improved? Yes, I think they have. Easier to work with, and does clean your pores. On the bad side, it also can pull out those ultrafine, barely-visible-to-the-naked-eyes hairs on your face. Those near microscopic hairs deflect light and give your skin a more even look.However, if you have a true (excuse the analogy) minefield on the face, better to use these and lose the hairs.", "\"I've tried a couple of different brands and have found Biore to be the best.  I gave it three stars, because I don't think it delivers 100% on its claims.  The promo says it \"\"removes deep-down dirt that can cause blackheads,\"\" this isn't entirely true.  The strips are excellent when you are trying to remove medium sized blackheads and does pick-up a lot of smaller white heads.  However, it leaves behind the smaller and larger blackheads. I found that the face strips weren't as effective as the nose strips on myself or my teenage boys. In fact, the face strips didn't work at all.  I am going to cut them down and use them as nose strips. The nose strips worked really well.  I will buy them again, because they lifted enough blackheads and whiteheads to make \"\"cleaning\"\" up my face a lot easier.  I found that after carefully removing the strip, it was easier to gently squeeze the area and remove the other blackheads and whiteheads.  This makes it worth the price.  Here are a few tips:* Wash your face with warm water before applying the strips.  It will open up your pores and help the strip be more effective* Pull the strip gently.  At times, it can adhere tightly and irritate your skin if you pull it off too quickly.* If you have sensitive skin, test a small piece before you use this product.  Again, it adheres to your skin really tightly -My son's friend was pleased to see that it removed the tiny hairs from his nose - so again, test it before you apply an entire strip.Overall, I the strips are great if you want some general facial cleanup.  The strips works well on medium sized blackheads and smaller whiteheads and are particularly effective in the nose area.  These strips will pull up enough dirt/pimples to make cleaning your face a lot easier.\"", "This product works better than I expected, but not as well as I would like. It does remove some of the blackheads, but not all of them, and repeated usage doesn't improve on that. My nose does look clearer, but after a month of weekly use, the appearance of my pores doesn't look diminished at all. At 50 a strip this is a much better deal than the six pack box, but I'd still rather invest in some decent face wash.", "I always saw this product as being for teenagers, or those in their 20s who still had oily skin.  However, I discovered it works pretty well on older individuals, too.  It caused no irritation when the strips were removed, and it had some long nice lasting effects on my skin.", "These little strips really do work at getting the dirt out of your pores. I was surprised at what came out of mine- show of a professional facial I don't think you can get your skin cleaner.", "I don't know what I ever did before these were made, but I've been using them for years. Even though I use an assortment of facial cleansers, nothing works as well as these strips. (Even my husband uses them from time to time.) There is something weirdly satisfying about being able to see the dirt that is pulled out of my pores.Since these strips have come out, Biore has been making other products, but I haven't found any of their products to be as effective as their strips; however, theBiore Blemish Fighting Ice CleanserandBiore Cleansing Clothsdo pretty well, especially when used with the strips.", "\"Pulling built up stuff out of your pores is not fabric of literature, but this reviewer likes the product none-the-less.  I waited for a week to assess the results of this crazy product and I cannot understand how it works.  Okay, the wet skin activates the \"\"glue\"\" on the strip and yanks the stuff out, but how does it do it without damaging or ripping your skin.  It somehow has the right balance of strength and performance. What can I say?  It works!\""], "A": [0.039340268820524216, 0.06486358493566513, 0.05839359760284424, 0.03307131677865982, 0.051544543355703354, 0.060264021158218384, 0.04747205600142479, 0.051239583641290665, 0.04894716665148735, 0.04935675859451294, 0.040496159344911575, 0.06464307010173798, 0.06339302659034729, 0.054666586220264435, 0.047901593148708344, 0.06209692731499672, 0.05694541707634926, 0.041802097111940384, 0.06356225162744522]}
