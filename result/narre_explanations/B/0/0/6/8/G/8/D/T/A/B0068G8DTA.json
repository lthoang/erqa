{"reviews": ["Does an okay job on the blackheads located on top of your nose but does not do a good enough job of clearing out the blackheads in the crease between the nose and cheek.  I have large pores and these strips I believe are more designed for someone who has a minor problem with blackheads.  The strips did not adhere good enough to my skin.  I expected to see the strip to come out looking like a porcupine but instead it looked like a lighted spotted Dalmatian.  I need a strip that is more aggressive.", "I tried the Biore deep cleaning pore strips and it was very easy to apply. The strip dried quickly, pulled off easily, and oh yuck, was disgustingly successful (as you can see by the picture I am uploading). My son tried one, he has a larger nose and had issues with the fit, to use it on the side where most of the clogged pores are he would have to cut the strip and apply to either side.My nose didn't feel painful (nor was the pull off painful) afterwards, a little dry but I hadn't moisturized between washing and applying the strip so it would be dry anyway. There's no residual redness or discomfort.The box does say not to use if sunburned, if you have spider veins, or an active breakout of acne, or are on acne medications.", "I've heard of, but have never tried these before. Glad I did - they are very effective in deep-cleaning pores. Usage is very simple: dampen the area, apply the strip, wait for it to dry, and peel it off. I didn't find it at all painful to pull off, but it does take some effort.The stuff that's on the removed strip will not be a pleasant sight! But it does do the job of deep cleaning.Although the manufacturer cautions that the strips should only be used on your nose, I tried it on other areas without any problem. I also found that the strips can be cut to size to make them more economical to use.Definitely worth looking into for deep cleaning.", "I've used Biore's nose strips for many years. If you're unfamiliar with them; place the strip on your wet nose, sticky side to your nose. It dries for 10 - 15 minutes and the strip becomes stiff, you peel it off and the gunk from your pores sticks to the strip. I'm not sure if it's oil, dirt or even little hairs but there's stuff all over the strip. It's pretty gross. There is almost an entertainment factor to it, you either want to hide the strip before anyone can see it or show it to someone for amusement.Use weekly for best results.", "I know it's silly but I have always liked these.  It seems ridiculous to plaster something on your nose to pull out everything on it.I haven't used these for years.  The design has changed a little with the cut-outs but it does the same thing.  It feels nice to have a clean nose. Isn't that weird?  The weirder thing though is to pull it off and then let it sit a few minutes so you can see what came off.  Weirdly satisfying.The first thing I always want to do is do it again but since I know better than that, I waited for the teenagers to come home and then tested it out on them.  They went along with it and went upstairs to watch the history channel (surely).  Then I yelled up to them that they could take them off and to put them down for a few minutes.  Then I told them to look.There was a lot of yelling about how gross they were and how gross the other one was.  One of them came down and wanted one that would fit over his whole face.  I'll give him one for his whole face, all right.  Doesn't it seem likeAmaco Claycrete Papier Mache 1 lb. bagwould work?", "This is the warning that is included on the packaging; unfortunately, it was not included in the online description for this product or I would never have ordered it.  If you are sensitive to any type of adhesive, this is not for you.  While I cannot try the product to see how effective it is, it is a good thing that someone mentions this warning.  The product may work great for others but I cannot use it as it may take a layer of my skin off with the blackheads.", "\"If you are older, you may recall versions of these sorts of pore strips which would be too harsh on your skin. I have had that experience. However,  as I get older, I also know that most boxes DO have directions. If you follow them, better effects will take place, and frightening things will be less apt to happen to you in your ongoing quest to be the mostbeautiful woman or man in your town.In my personal town, we have Sonia. She is pretty beautiful, but she might not actually live in my town. She might just work here. That being said,I COULD very well BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN MY TOWN (if I could only fix my hair problem, and \"\"get a time machine\"\", as my husband Jim always says).Why?Because I read this box and followed the directions and these Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, by Biore, actually are gentle and do work.So now I have a nice nose (if a tiny bit large). With this as part of my arsenal of \"\"Jean will be gorgeous\"\" products, if it actually does, after repeated use, make my pores look smaller, I might be able to be the most beautiful woman in THIS TOWN... and maybe a mile or so into the next town. We'll just have to wait and see.They do work, they don't hurt, they add to your flash and flirt.best wishes,jean\"", "\"I decided to compare three different pore strips, Biore Original, Biore Ultra and Kose, a Japanese brand. I chose to use the Kose strip first because I really wanted to compare the two versions of Biore, and I figured it would be a more fair comparison if I used the Kose first and ripped out the tiny little hairs on my nose as well as making an original pass at my clogged pores. The Kose strips don't work quite as well as Biore, but pretty close and they are less expensive. Plus, they are BLACK so if you want to be like that woman in the commercial who is examining her pore strip and going \"\"oh gross, it looks like a porcupine!\"\" (and isn't that half the point of using pore strips?) the black makes it very easy to see all the gross stuff you get out of your nose. Fun, fun!After the Kose strips I waited five days before trying the Biore Original.I like to use pore strips right out of a long, steamy shower. I then remove the sides of the pore strip pouch, loosen the slits on the actual strip and set it aside while I take a cotton ball and thoroughly wet it with warm water. I squeeze most of the water out of the cotton ball and then wet my nose and the area on either side. After peeling the strip from its backing and forming the strip around my nose, I wring even more water out of the cotton ball and then use it on top to complete the formation of the strip around my nose. I find it is then important to not doing anything to move my face. No talking or chewing. Only very careful sipping of liquids. A little fanning with a piece of paper or a paper fan is helpful to get the strip to dry faster but not too fast.After peeling the \"\"original\"\" strip from my face, I found a fair amount of pore gunk, and also plenty of tiny fine hairs. I was a bit surprised to see so many just five days after the Kose strip. Finally, about five days after that, I used the \"\"ULTRA\"\" strip. It vexes me that there are two types of Biore strips and at the store it is necessary to choose - do I want a few more strips for the price or do I want the promise of an even stronger unclogging of clogged pores? What I found was that the ULTRA seemed to work slightly better, seemingly by having a stronger adhesive. It was a bit more painful to rip from the nose and arguably had a bit more pore gunk (and still more tiny, fine hairs. Where do they all come from?) The ULTRA basically costs 33% more and is maybe 33% more effective - but if you use the entire package then I guess they come out about the same in the end. The ULTRA strips made my nose feel a bit sore and raw after using. In the end I think I'd choose Original over ULTRA because I feel it's less damaging to the skin, but if I had younger (maybe teenage) skin I might be more likely to go for the ULTRA.\"", "I have oily skin and large pores that have bothered me since I was a teen. I love these Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips because, while I don't get big blackheads, I do get buildup in my pores that just make me feel icky. Using these strips, though, makes me feel like I have some control over my nose's appearance.The strips are easy to use. You need to wash your face well first; I find the strips work best after a long hot shower or bath, when steam has opened up my pores. The strip is peeled back from it's plastic backing and applied to the nose. You need to make sure it's smoothed over the entire surface of your nose. I sometimes dip my finger in just a bit of water to help make sure that there's enough moisture on the strip to make it adhere well. You can't really leave the strip on too long, but if you don't leave it on long enough, it's just not going to do anything. I tend to leave mine on for a good 15 minutes or so (lwhile I'm getting dressed, combing my hair, or reading a chapter in my current book). When I peel it back, I make sure to use a finger on one hand to press against my cheek and give some tension as I use the other hand to peel back the strip.On first glance, you might not notice that the strip has done a lot, but if you tilt it just so in the light, you will be able to see all the gunk that gets pulled out of your pores. It's gross and fascinating and effective all at the same time, and after I've used a strip, I can see a dramatic difference in the appearance of my pores. Whether anyone else can see the difference or not, I know that using these strips makes me feel like I look better. I have noticed that if I try to use a strip after just 2 or 3 days they don't do anything (perhaps not enough gunk to grab on to); so I try to use these about every other week.I do wish the packaging for this product were a little less wasteful (it's a fairly big box considering there are only 8 strips in it), but I don't know that retail stores would want to carry anything smaller because of the theft risk. In any case, I'll keep buying these strips because I love what they do for my pores.", "I've been using Biore's pore strips for years, and nothing else comes close. They're easy to use and they work. Even after doing a deep cleaning of my face, the Biore strips always pull something gross out of the pores on my nose.I use them once a week, and they're worth every penny. I've never found a knockoff that comes close to doing the job.As long as they make Biore strips, I'll be buying them.", "I used these many years ago and loved the visible results. So I was please to be able to try them again. Since I don't actually have issues anymore (and they don't work on wrinkles) I tried them on my son, who is going through 'those teenage years' and has a number of clogged pores and blackheads.While I found that they did a good job with him, it didn't seem to get as much as I thought it should. I made a visible difference, smoothed out the surface of his nose but left a couple of (albeit lighter) blackheads.So overall, I'm pleased with the product but wondering it its lost a little zip over the years.", "I remember as a teenager trying to figure out how to remove those unsightly little blackheads that populated my nose. I even debated placing a piece of tape on my nose to see if that would remove them. So you can imaging my shear delight when Bior&eacute; first came out with their deep cleansing pore strips. I like how effective they are at getting the minute black-heads off my nose. Not to be gross, but I still remember the first time I used them - the strip looked like it had a forest of little spiky black specks. All of my black-heads were gone.Though there are other brands out there now, I still gravitate back to the Bior&eacute; strips.", "My daughters and I have used these strips for years, and they really do a great job of removing blackheads and opening blocked pores.  They are meant to be applied on a clean, wet nose, then left to dry for about 15 minutes.  Once they are totally dry, you peel off the strip and admire the blackheads and dirt sticking to it. No soap or washcloth can remove dirt and oil *inside* the pores.I've noticed as I've gotten older that these strips are more damaging to my skin.  And I've read a few articles that mention that these are a no-no for people with rosacea or very sensitive skin. Older skin is thinner and more fragile, so it makes sense that Biore strips would be too harsh.  So I just use them less frequently - probably 4 times per year when I notice that I have blocked pores in my nose.My daughters use them about once a week, and don't have any issues with skin damage.  Having young skin causes blackheads, but they can also tolerate using these strips to take care of them.Biore strips are a great tool for removing blackheads, just use them with care and common sense.", "\"I've been using Biore strips for over 10 years now and they perform exactly as they did back in my High School days. Too often products are changed over time and end up not being as effective so it's always refreshing to find a product that works well and hasn't been messed with in the name of saving production costs.These strips are very easy to use. You simply wash your face, leaving your nose area wet and place the strip over it. Once the strip has dried (10-15 minutes), peel it off your face and be both disgusted and amazed at how much \"\"pore-clogging dirt, oil and blackheads\"\" it removed from your pores.After using I clean up with a bit of toner. My skin looks cleaner and feels noticeably softer after using these. I love these strips and hope they never change them. Excellent product!\"", "I love Biore strips as an occassional deep cleaaner for my pores.  A clean pore, an empty pore is a small looking pore.  And a little pore is the happiest pore in my opinion.These are easy to use, and if used according to directions work well and are painless.  Less messy than masks, and less irritating. Unless you have particularly oily skin, you won't need these often, so this pack of 8 really is a nice quantity.", "I love Biore strips, and have used them about once a month for years.  Personally I do not have extra sensitive skin or allergies to any adhesives but I find that is sufficient to keep my pores clean around my nose.  I've noticed that they do work better after a warm shower or after wetting your nose for a few minutes with warm water to open the poses a bit. Sometimes it can sting a slight bit removing the strip, but it is no big deal for me since the result is so worth it.  The amount of dirt seen on the strip is impressive and I find I save a lot of money by not having to go for facials very often, since my nose is the area that I most have large pores and blackheads.", "Judging by the amount of gunk on the strip after I pulled it off...these are very effective.  When it hardens, it really is on there tight.  They are very easy to use too. I've tried others in the past and been disappointed when I pulled them off because nothing was really on the strip, but these really worked. I would recommend this product.", "Disgusting as it is to see little black bits on the strip after use, you can't argue with the results.  After using this a bit now, my skin looks clean and clear and yes, the pores look a bit diminished.  This is very easy to use.  Clean and dry your skin.  Take it out of the package, twist it to loosen the little groves, and put the smooth side on your skin.  Wait 10-15 minutes and peel it off.  That's it.And I have to confess - whether I'm supposed to or not, I didn't just use it on my nose.  I also used it on my forehead and was thrilled with the results.Granted, the five-year-old laughs at me when it's on my face, but I love the results.  I'll continue to use these strips!", "My daughter (13) and I tried these out.  They work.  There's no question that something is being removed from our nasal area.  I can tell because I now have large open pores glaring back at me in the mirror.  (Honestly, I'm not sure it's an improvement...)As far as ease of use, it's pretty straightforward.  Wet nose, plaster strip on and wait.  Removing it is more of a chore as it has to be done delicately.My daughter's perky little nose didn't show much difference, but she is blessed with this lovely peaches and cream complexion.  Her strip did show goo, but there was no dramatic 'effect'.  (note: she had a thick layer of sticky residue that had to be washed off with soap)My nose, on the other hand, only had a tad of residue, but showed a lot more gunk.  (Apparently it's been camouflaged there for years.PROs--easy to use--worksCONs--my nose is dry and sore.  Granted it's winter, but this product would appear to be too harsh for my aged skinWould definitely recommend to younger women and guys.  I think for older skin something more delicate would be better.  My nose actually hurts and is dry and irritated after only one use.", "I have used this product now for a few weeks and I cannot get tired of obsessively examining the strip of what is pulled out of my pores.  The first week I used it every other day, of course it dried my skin so I use it once a week now.  I have also bought a second box and will now keep this as part of my skin care routine.  Together with my pore minimizer serum.  My pores have been getting smaller and my face looks smoother.  I Love these pore strips.", "removes make up does not dry out your face, I like this product a lot. you do have to use more than one wipe to get the make up off but it is great at it even mascara", "I used to use these often as a teen, but it's only been in the past few years that I've started getting blackheads again. These work as well as they use to, though the strip removal is almost as bad as waxing! I think I have a new (or new again after years without them) beauty item!", "My teen daughter and I tried these strips.  The first time around, she didn't get her nose wet enough and at the end of the waiting time, not much came off.  I had great results even the first time I used them.I thought I didn't have many blackheads or so much gunk but was surprised when I saw all the yuck on the strip.  I did have a bit of glue residue that washed off easily.  Get the nose really wet and you will see the results.  Always test for sensitive skin (I cut a small piece and tried it on because I was not sure if I'd be allergic to the glue since I've had issues in the past).  So far, no problem, just a clean nose.", "\"If you have not used these types of products before, take a minute or so after you've followed the directions and look at the strip side that was against your nose.  It may gross you out but all that black, gray, and brown stuff sticking up was in your pores.Regular use does indeed reduce pore side and what you get out of them decreases in color and size as well.  However the first two or three times you use these you may experience pimples because the open pores can now get filled with other matter.  Makes sure you practice good hygiene especially after you remove the strip and it will help.The smaller count package of a more \"\"intense\"\" version of these strip is really not necessary if you use them once a week as instructed.\"", "I've been using Biore Pore Strips for years and it's quite amazing how well these things work.  If you've never used these before then you're in for quite a shock the first time you use them.  As long as you follow the directions correctly then you should be quite shocked to see the amount of stuff that comes out of your pores.  It's like looking at a mini porcupine on the strip.  It's a bit gross to look at and think about the fact that all that stuff was built up inside your pores but you're nose will feel like it's taking a breath of fresh air.  It's an incredibly nice, clean feel.It's not the most comfortable feeling to remove them from your skin and I have paper thing skin right below my eyes so I don't push it down at the very top in that spot but it's not so uncomfortable that it makes you not want to do it.If you've never used these before I would highly recommend that you give them a try.  You'll be amazed at what they can do.", "This is one of those products that you probably wouldn't have thought actually do anything unless you've actually tried them. But they do and it's quite shocking to see the results.To use, you wet your nose, apply the strip then wait a while and peel off. What you get is a little forest of trees consisting of all the grime and grease in your skin. It's not a pleasant thought but the alternative is that gunk remains on your nose and can cause zits and so on.Biore strips work great and don't have to be used that often. Highly recommended.", "After using these strips for several weeks and really not having any results, I've come to the conclusion that they do not always work if you do not have obvious blackheads. If your nose is not showing blackheads, these do not seem to remove just clogged pores, which is what I have and was hoping to see some results in clearing them up. They really do not seem to do the deep cleansing job on that skin condition.I followed directions, left them on for the required time. The strip gets hard, almost like a light weight cast. By wiggling my nose, they loosened up a bit and when I removed them there was nothing to see. I have tried soaking my nose with a warm washcloth thinking that would help open pores to let these clean them and still no results."], "A": [0.03604242950677872, 0.03194931149482727, 0.03472135588526726, 0.02927658148109913, 0.03524676710367203, 0.03444570302963257, 0.04225083813071251, 0.03049398399889469, 0.024785999208688736, 0.021924108266830444, 0.028321119025349617, 0.03624418377876282, 0.022573694586753845, 0.046403177082538605, 0.04387706518173218, 0.03938906267285347, 0.04533763229846954, 0.0445697158575058, 0.04280010610818863, 0.04186716303229332, 0.04826444387435913, 0.048432283103466034, 0.029194340109825134, 0.03811533376574516, 0.04062000662088394, 0.04065398871898651, 0.04219961538910866]}
