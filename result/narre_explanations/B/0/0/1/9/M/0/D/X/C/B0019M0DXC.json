{"reviews": ["This product has to be the worst fitting, problematic device on the market.  It is uncomfortable and does not fit in your ear properly no matter how much you adjust it.  You also cannot turn the volume up too high or you'll hear screeching feedback.I wish I never had purchased it.  It is worse than nothing.  The price is staggaring as well...I only purchased because it was the only device that I found that was compatible with the crappy corporate phones we use.  Thank God I didn't pay for it personally (charged to the company).", "I have wrist issues so I wasn't able to hold a portable phone for long periods of time.  I've had one other headphone and it was horrid, I was afraid to try another.  However, after reading all the reviews I decided to fork over the money and give this one a try.  Am I ever glad I did.  It's fairly comfortable, easy to use, and the range is fantastic!  I was able to go to the end of the driveway to get the mail, all the while talking with a friend... the reception was perfect!  I've yet to experience any interference and no one has said one word about my being on a headset.  The last one I had nearly everyone thought I was on a speakerphone, cell phone, or some other phone because of the poor reception.  This one is fantastic, expensive but definitely worth it!", "Sound quality is very good and the operation range is good without any problem. Easy to operate, just plug and play.", "more headaches with this device then its worth in savings.Lifter for this device is garbage.  look at those reviews as well.2 stars because it works but you sound distant, even when I have the audio gain turned all the way up.Technical support is useless!  instructions are overly worded.Summery:  Get a 'Hook switch' built in device! Get with another brand like JABRA or get a refurbished Plantronics if trying to save.", "Had to update this review as I have also experienced the broken plastic piece that holds the headband, so you can't wear it on your head without repairing it.  I was able to do so with a couple of wire ties, but it looks a bit sad.  Poor quality plastic was used and it fractures with regular uses.  now that I've repaired it, it will probably last.  Still very happy with the quality of the sound both send and receive.Plugs into the wall jack so it is a stand alone device, but you need to have another phone in the house to make outgoing calls.  I use my other phones to make the call, then join the call with this headset and hang up the other phone.  This may link to DECT 6 remote phones, but I didn't try that.  Didn't seem to be a need to do that and tie up another station on my phone system.  The incoming volume is widely adjustable.  The outgoing voice is clearly heard on the other end.  Only downside is that it is hard to tell when you have pressed the mute button.  I sometimes have to walk back to the base station to see the indicator since people talking loud can cover the small beep that happens when you put the device on mute.", "For the last couple of years I've been using Google Voice routed through my cell phone for business calls.  This worked great in general - but left me open to any fluctuations in the cell signal, which doesn't make a great impression on clients.  Cell phones also tend to have a one-person-at-a-time effect, so it's often impossible to hear the other person if you both start talking at the same time.Anyway, a couple of months ago I decided I was going to start routing the Google Voice calls through the PC with a DECT 6.0 headset (since I've become used to the Bluetooth headset with my cell phone).My first attempt was to pick up aPlantronics Savi W740since I had used Plantronics in the past and figured it would be an excellent headset.  Unfortunately, the promise did not live up to the reality.  The Plantronics is extremely comfortable; but, the sound quality wasn't great and it wouldn't work for answering Google Voice calls on the PC.  It also routed all the PC audio through the headset, which is not what I wanted at all.That sent me back to the drawing board; but, with a better idea of what I was actually looking for.Fortunately, my next find was this AT&T; TL7610 headset - and it turns out this is exactly what I was looking for!  I was able to get the phone, thematching dial pad, and theOBi110 VoIP Telephone Adapter- all for less than the cost of the Plantronics.Here are the things I love about the AT&T; headset:- It is fairly comfortable (although it isn't as comfortable as the Plantronics model was).  I'm using the over-the-head wearing style since I think the ability to hang directly on the ear is just for advertising.  Smaller Bluetooth headsets work great like that; but, it's hard to imagine letting this TL7610 hang on my ear all day.- The sound quality is excellent!  I can hear my customers perfectly and haven't had any complaints from them either.  It is also very resistant to both breathing and wind noises - which the Plantronics picked up horribly.- The range is very good.  I can move throughout the house and out to the workshop without any issues.- It is very easy to setup and use.  All the buttons are intuitively placed and there aren't really any multi-second/multi-key combos you have to remember.The only real downside to this headset is the way the notification beeps work.  For example, both being on mute and having a low battery will result in a beep - but they are timed differently.  That isn't a very effective notification scheme since I don't have time to count seconds between beeps while I'm on the phone.  Honestly, a voice notification would be a huge improvement in this area.If you're not going to be using this with another phone, then I highly recommend getting thematching dial pad.  At first I was just using the Google callback feature on my tablet to make calls through this headset - but that completely breaks if you call a number that requires going through a menu (i.e. enter the extension of the person you wish to talk to...).Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this headset.  I feel like it's a great value for what it is - and it's been a MUCH better solution for me than using my cell phone with a Bluetooth headset.", "Sound quality and talk time are both fantastic. I can be on conference calls all day long and never get a low battery warning beep as long as I charge it nightly. This device is basically a cordless phone without a dial pad. I keep the base downstairs and use the headset in my home office upstairs. The only challenge I have not being by the base is sometimes I have a hard time telling if I'm on mute or not. The base has a LED that lights up when you are on mute. The range is fine as I can wear the headset anywhere in my house and never have issues with call quality or noise. I have yet to venture out far enough to find out how far I need to be before call quality drops. If you get the optional dial pad you can use this as a stand alone phone. You can also answer calls on it directly without needing you regular phone. I use this with a home cordless phone and it works great. Highly recommend.", "\"This item replaced my Plantronics 55CS office headset. I loved the Plantronics, but had two complaints: It had limited range (in my home) and seemed subject to static electricity which required occasionally resetting the headset-to-base communication link.The AT&T; unit has MUCH better range - I can now make it all the way to my kitchen (only about 15 yards as the crow flies, but there are several appliances in the direct line from the base to the kitchen) and keep listening and speaking to the other party. It's too early to know for sure whether the AT&T; will be subject to the same static-electricity-killing-the-connection problem that the Plantronics had.The overall sound quality of the AT&T; is OK, but not as clear as the Plantronics. There is a slight \"\"scratchiness\"\" or tinniness with the AT&T; unit. It's perfectly usable, but not quite as quiet and crystal-clear as the Plantronics.I don't use the earloops on these devices - I only use the over-the-head device. It took only a few minutes to discover that the over-the-head device that came with the AT&T; unit was very uncomfortable. Fortunately, I was able to make some modifications to the Plantronics headband so that the AT&T; earpiece would fit it - so I am using the AT&T; device mounted in the Plantronics headband and of course it is now as comfortable as the old unit. But people who don't have another headband to mount the earpiece into may be disappointed in the comfort of the AT&T; I cannot vouch for whether buyers will be happy with any of the earloops provided by AT&T; because I don't use them.So, with the modification of the headband, and the new longer range, I am overall more happy with the AT&T;, even with the slight loss in sound quality.Update 11/26/2011. I am pleased to report that this device does not seem to be subject to the ESD (electrostatic discharge) that plagued my prior Plantronics unit. I have NEVER had to reset the communication between the base and the headset, even after a few power outages. I am still quite pleased with this unit.\"", "I have a dual line ATT desk phone that I use for working in my home office. I tried all sorts of inexpensive wired headsets and ALL of them had issues with sound quality or volume (either speaking or listening). I finally decided to quit messing around with cheap stuff and bought this. What a great choice! The range is excellent (I can walk outside and down the drive), plus I can adjust both the transmission volume and the listening volume to get the best results. I HIGHLY recommend getting the kit that includes the handset lifter for the phone. That way you can answer the phone while you are not sitting in front of it. You simply press the button on the side of the headset and the lifter picks up the headset..and voila..you're connected. I HIGHLY recommend this unit. Great sound quality. Great battery life. Easy to install. Great range.", "\"This is a headset only phone, which for me, replaces a \"\"normal\"\" household telephone. I was using the Plantronics cs55h but it became prone to severe static so when I found this phone (ATT clearly copied the cs55h, but I'm not complaining) I was thrilled with the sound quality. The problem is that no one at AT&T uses one, you can tell, because there is no head in the world that would find their ridiculous head bands comfortable. The problem is that the actual phone is rather heavy and extended use can really hurt. On just normal wear, I've broken 4, yes for of the \"\"across the top of the head\"\" one (my preferred piece). It's just a thoughtless, poorly designed piece of shiz.  Calling support to get another does gets you one, but they remind you, JUST ONE. The other thing is that they make a dial pad to go with it because what's the point of it being wireless if you can't call someone from where you are. But you have to pay extra for that.  So for sound clarity it's fabulous - for comfort, you will have to prepare a second option, At&T clearly did little product testing. I've liked the sound enough to buy three of them (because the plastic just falls apart at the seams) -- I will wait for a remarkable new one from Plantronics and switch back (they clearly understand comfortable head gear). AT&T made their head set unique enough that you can't really find a replacement for alternate wear. I've got cotton pads taped to my band to help not hurt and duct tape on the actual phone where the seams are...Looks like crap but the sound....\"", "The audio quality of this headset is good but you cannot pick up the phone on this headset unless you also buy a AT&T; TL7000 lifter too! And that lifter is not available from Amazon - only AT&T; for another eighty bucks plus shipping. So the whole cost of this wireless headset solution comes out very expensive.UPDATE 1/28/2012:AT&T; TL7000 Handset Lifter for Digital Cordless Headset, Blackis now available at Amazon at a much cheaper price than from AT&T; - web site or phone order.", "I bought one of these for my girlfriend a few months back.  I'm going to buy another one for myself.Firstly, if your love usually lives and sleeps under a different roof, you need some sort of hands free.  It isn't for nasty chat, it's so that you can chatter while doing chores and stuff around the house.  It really increases your chat time.  I also find that it results in a cleaner house because I can only do relatively mindless chores (like washing dishes, putting stuff away, ...) while talking.My current hands free is just a wired head set going to my cordless hand set.  It works decently but is a bit a bit clunky because I have to route the wire and clip the handset to my shirt or something.  It can get awkward.  I'm up grading.This AT&T; unit is not nearly as awkward.  My GF has logged some serious hours on hers without complaint.  It was very easy to hook up but did take a few experiments until she found a comfortable way to wear it.  I haven't used the unit, just hooked it up and talked to my girlfriend while she uses it.  The sound quality is as good as any of her other handsets.  This is probably the best thing I've bought so far for my girlfriend, and our relationship."], "A": [0.2925368547439575, 0.0022674070205539465, 0.5292127132415771, 4.920053106616251e-05, 0.1756065934896469, 1.5809178965930926e-10, 0.0003133680147584528, 4.067105546490308e-20, 1.4243618506881717e-09, 1.0502494269056096e-26, 1.1727534741934331e-11, 1.3937305084255058e-05]}
