{"reviews": ["\"I was actually surprised by how much my kids liked this toy. It's a series of wooden animals with a hole through them and a long string with a wooden stick at the end that can thread the animals. I naturally assumed the kids would get bored of this quickly, but surprisingly they haven't yet. The wooden pieces are very durable, were well designed, and are brightly painted. The wooden \"\"needle\"\" at the end of the thread makes it easy for a child to thread the animals on the string (my 2 year old had no problems with it). I'm sure the limited possibilities will eventually bore my kids, but they haven't yet.\"", "Seeing the kid play with the toy it is fun. This is one of my favorite toys from Alex, this is the second one we get. (the other one is cars) and it work great. I like this one more, because you can use it to teach animal sounds and more aside of the actual teaching abilities of the toy and the fact that teach fine movement skills.", "\"My daughter is 28 months old, and we gave her this String a Farm set for Christmas this year.  She immediately grasped the concept of stringing the wooden farm pieces on the string, though I think they do bead projects at her pre-school, so this wasn't a new concept for her.  Unlike some other stringing-type toys, this set is very sturdy and very well designed.  The string is thick and tightly woven, so it doesn't catch or snag on the pieces.  I love that one end of the string is anchored by a wooden piece that is permanently attached, so the other pieces don't fall off when you strong them on (a source of endless frustration to a toddler).  Also, the stringing end of the string is a 3-inch wooden \"\"needle\"\" so it is very easy to push the needle through the thick wood pieces, even for small, uncoordinated hands.  All in all, this is a great toy that has given my daughter hours of fun.\"", "My daughter's only 20 months, so under the recommended age. She isn't really able to do the stringing yet. But she likes me to do it and then she plays with it and takes it apart. She also plays with the animals on their own. My 5 year old with play with her as well. It feels like a good quality sturdy toy.", "This is a great set and makes an excellent gift. The blocks are large enough for little hands to easily grasp. My son likes to set them up and make a farm scene and play with them that way as well as stringing them. The blocks are durable and painted nicely, the holes for stringing are well made and it is easy enough for my toddler to string the beads. There are no choking hazards that I could find and overall I found this set to be a favorite toy!", "This toy is really cute. I got it for my toddler daughter because she loves putting things into holes (like pens into pen lids). This toy is perfect! I love the cute and colorful farm animals that are easy to grab for little fingers. This toy is nice quality and durable.", "My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this toy.  I showed her how to do it the first time, and she immediately picked up the concept.  This is an excellent toy to help teach patience, and to help encourage fine motor skills.I have seen similar sets before, with just plain wooden beads.  I think that the farm theme to this set helps hold the interest of a child."], "A": [0.14122657477855682, 0.150271475315094, 0.12177983671426773, 0.1537042111158371, 0.14034155011177063, 0.1461961716413498, 0.14648015797138214]}
