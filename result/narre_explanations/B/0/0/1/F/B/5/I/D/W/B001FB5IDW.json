{"reviews": ["This is nice lotion in that it feels good, moisturizes well, and doesn't feel greasy. It has a light scent that happens to be one I don't care for, but it dissipates quickly, so it's not a big deal. I have been using this lotion for two weeks now, and my skin does feel nice, but no better than it did with my previous lotion. I don't know how to measure the firmness of skin, but I don't think mine feels any different than before. If I were to use this for a few months, I might notice a difference, but so far, not so much. I do like the way it feels, and I also like the fact that a little goes a long way.", "\"I'm always looking for new lotions to try. I liked the feel and texture of the Nivea skin firming lotion, but I did not experience the \"\"skin firming\"\" part. It's a good every day type lotion that absorbs into the skin very well.\"", "It's a very light lotion with almost no scent, which I like,  but I don't know how firming it is. It's not greasy and rubs in easily and completely. I usually prefer a heavier lotion but this is perfect under make up.", "I haven't used Nivea products in years but decided to give this one a try. The lotion promises to provide all day moisture, tighter, more resilient skin and improved skin texture. The lotion is relatively thin but applies easily. It is not greasy. I did not care for the aroma. It is initially very strong and sweet. The first few days I used this product it was overwhelming and didn't fade significantly. However after about a week, it seems to have weakened. It is still noticeable but is much milder. After two weeks I can say this works well as a body lotion. My skin's softness and smoothness lasted all day. I did not notice any change in firmness, resilience or texture.While I did not experience any side effects from using this lotion, I note it contains mineral oil. While generally considered safe, it has been known to cause rashes, irritation and dryness in sensitive skin. I prefer to use lotions without mineral oil.Although I credit this product with providing all day moisture and smoothness, I really didn't care for the scent and the mineral oil. It is no miracle in a bottle but it does function well as a body lotion.", "Tried this in our home and love the feel, the scent and the way the product works. Super love that its unisex so not too flowery for the man in my life to use on his skin. It works as described and the packaging is easy to use.", "I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and love it.  It smells great and really seems to be starting to firm my skin.The best thing I like about this lotion is that it seems that it keeps moisturizing your skin all day.  It does not disappear like some moisturizers.  It keeps on working.", "I have very dry skin, but I am also picky when it comes to lotions. I don't like the way a lot of lotions leave my skin feeling. Some leave it too slippery, or too sticky or too greasy. But this Nivea skin firming body lotion feels good on the skin. Easy to apply, it is not a thick lotion almost on the side of a bit runny. But I like the way it feels. It doesn't have a harsh smell, it has a smell that a lot of my hair conditioners smell like.I haven't used it enough to comment on the skin firming aspect of it, but if I notice that affect I will update my review. But, I am mostly using it to hydrate my dry skin. I like the pump top, easy to dispense the lotion. Didn't have any trouble getting the lotion out of the bottle.I usually use Vaseline lotion, and it has the same feel to it as the Vaseline lotion. So if you like vaseline you might like this lotion as well.", "\"Nivea Skin Firming Body Lotion worked very well for my super dehydrated skin on my body. Unlike other brands (like Keri, Lubriderm, etc.) it soaks in rather than laying on top of the skin, creating a \"\"sticky\"\" surface. I hate having to let my lotion \"\"dry\"\" before getting dressed....it's annoying. I got much better results by a gentle exfoliation with a dry brush prior to application. I also use exfoliating gloves in the shower, and that helps the product penetrate better as well (I like to apply my lotion on damp skin to lock the water in). It worked especially well on rough areas like knees, ankles, and elbows.I have a mild case of eczema and this lotion kept flare ups down to a minimum.It does have a fragrance that tends to linger (less in hot weather, perspiration tones the scent down considerably).  I wasn't bothered by the fragrance, the scent is very similar to some hair products I've used in the past. But if you like a much less \"\"perfume-y\"\" lotion, I would try something else....an unscented lotion would be better. As long as I'm not attracting bugs (some no-seeums and mosquitoes adore scented lotion) I'm happy. I apply a sunscreen on top of this lotion (it worked well with my self tanner too) and I'm good to go! FYI: My skin is very dry naturally and due to living in a dry climate, and is \"\"post menopausal\"\". Products very seldom make me break out since I have so little oil in my skin and I exfoliate regularly for my eczema. That may have some bearing on the result I got. Unfortunately, my skin wasn't any firmer as the name of the product implies. If that were the case I'd purchase enough to fill up a bathtub and soak in it for a few days. The \"\"skin firming\"\" claim is a bit over-the-top, but it's a good product at a very fair price in my opinion.\"", "\"Well, nothing firms your body except exercise - we all know this.  However, this is a nice lotion, smooth and sweet-smelling.  I couldn't tell that it had any particular \"\"firming\"\" effect on my skin, though.\"", "Skin starting to sag a bit here and there, so I decided to try this given what others had said about it being good at firming and in a short time.Unlike some other reviewers, I did not notice any odd smell when using the product. It has a light smell at most and pleasant if anything to me.It goes on well and absorbs pretty quickly for the most part. No greasy feeling. Does help with dry spots pretty quickly. Still need more time with it to see how well it works at firming, but I do have some indications that it might work out.The one thing that I didn't like very much was that it does feel a little heavy for a while after putting it on.Overall, so far so good.", "This is amazing, i love the way it feels, not a greasy or sticky feeling. Skin is glowing and moisturized completely by this. I noticed the firming of my skin after about three weeks. i used it after every shower sometimes before bed in addition. Does better after a shower or bath to me. The skin is still wet and it seems to absorb better. Also love that it has a decent smell to it and not a chemical smell.", "I use a lot of body lotion because of my dry skin. When I received the bottle of lotion, I didn't immediately figure out how to get the pump going. My husband figured that the instructions on the white part of the pump.  There are white raised letters on white and I couldn't see it because of my glaucoma.The sense is pleasant not very strong so that is great. The consistency is lush, thick and non-greasy.My skin already feels softer.I haven't had time to find out if it firms or not because I just got it. If it does, then I will be back for more. Today I am just enjoying this luxurious body lotion. I think almost all lotion is soothing  but this definitely is.", "I really love how well this stuff works. I do not care for the smell. It is a little to perfumy for me.", "An itchy, bumpy, red rash has developed all over my legs and arms after use of this product for several days.  I didn't know if it was just a coincidence, until I started reading similar reviews.  So, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to skip this product!", "I'd tried some of this lotion at my sister's house a while back, and it felt just divine. I've got dry old skin, the kind that's not only itchy but looks loose and wrinkled. (Well, I AM 60 years old.) I haven't been able to stand too many lotions because they are too heavy and seem to make matters worse, plus I'm getting more sensitive to additives and fragrances as I get older. But this Nivea Q10 body lotion feels really good, the feeling lasts a long time, I don't have a bad reaction to it, and I do see an improvement in the tautness of my skin. Even if it didn't firm up my skin, though, I'd still love this lotion. It really does feel great on my skin.", "Thank goodness I haven't had any rash from using this like some folks have.  I've been using it on my arms, hands and elbows.  As an older woman, my skin is fairly dry and working outside dries it out even more.I like the scent of the lotion and the fact that it's not real thick.The pump feature dispenses enough to apply a light coat to both arms and hands with a single pump.The lotion is absorbed pretty quickly, but I feel it does leave a slightly waxy residue.  It's not oily, but feels a little waxy.  It seems to be doing a decent job of moisturizing the dry skin on my arms and hands, but I'd hesitate to use it on my face for fear the waxiness might clog pores.", "Well, I'll admit it, after reading the incredibly negative reviews here about developing contact dermatitis (as a result of an apparent mineral oil allergy), I was concerned. Still, I used the product and experienced no negative side-effects whatsoever. Here is my experience:Pros:-Some people complain about the fragrance. In my opinion, it was so light that I did not even notice it. In fact, I only noticed the scent when I was doing laundry and could smell it on my clothes ever-so-lightly.-I use a fair amount of lotion ... occasionally it leaves white marks on my clothes or even temporary white streaks on my skin. Perhaps as a result of the mineral oil, this comes out of the bottle white but soon becomes clear on the skin.-Left my skin super, super soft.Potential con:-It would appear that consumers are viewing this product as some sort of $8.00 miracle. Savvy buyers know that these lotions are fantastic for making skin soft (and in some cases, with better lotions containing retinoids, can improve texture), but not much else. If you need help with anti-aging or loose skin following weight loss, see your dermatologist/cosmetic surgeon (there are many options available ... some swear by Thermage). And, add strength training to your daily schedule. A tone body can go far.This is a nice lotion, but as with all purely cosmetic over-the-counter products, keep your expectations realistic and you will be pleased.", "I have always been very pale so I have always had to protect my face from the sun. I do have some wrinkle but not very bad. My hands however have gotten that papery old lady look. They really tell my age.I did not expect much from this lotion other than moisturization. Almost no lotion does all the things claimed. But this one really does help. My arms and legs do not show much difference. But the thin papery old lady skin on my hands has improved. I have tried lots of things to correct that problem. Some of them were quite expensive. But this is a great product at a great price. It does feel a tad sticky but I don't care.", "\"This lotion claims to be skin-firming. Although I like the lotion for its moisturizing properties, if you are expecting this to make it look like you've put extra time in the gym or had some medical touch-ups, you'll be disappointed. Granted, I knew up front that the claim probably wouldn't hold water (no pun intended)...at least not in one bottle. It has a light scent and feel which is good because I am in Texas in the summer. However, the claim that it will make your skin firmer and \"\"more toned\"\" (back of the bottle) within two weeks, did not prove true for me. Perhaps my lack of toning isn't enough for me to have been able to tell a difference but I'm almost through the bottle and it's been several weeks and nothing remarkable.\"", "Who knew Nivea skin firming lotion was so good. Maybe it's the Q10 supplement but I like how this lotion feels when applied and without any residue after application. For the record I have combo skin type and but this lotion up there with lubriderm or high end lotions by Kiel's.", "\"The skin care product, Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion, which I have been using, says on the back, \"\" Nivea's exclusive Hydra IQ technology supports skin's own hydration network to unleash deep non-stop moisture that lasts more than 24 hours.\"\"OK, that makes sense. I believe this skin care lotion does assist one's own skin stay moisturized, if you use it every day.However, I think any body lotion would accomplish that task without some arcane exotic \"\"technologies\"\"  to attempt to fool the buyer into thinking cellulite will disappear. On the Amazon page for this, below the photo, in fact, there is a statement that you can read which informs you cellulite is not going to go away if you use this product.I think that the implication of the name is very misleading and intentionally so. People these days are doing a lot of self care to save money.  Many of the ladies who used to go to salons and spas for massages and skin treatments cannot afford to do this any more.I am possibly imputing too much importantance to my thoughts on the phrases and words  \"\"skin firming\"\" and \"\"Q 10\"\", but I am bothered by the snake-oil aspect of this product.I read all the ingredients. I don't like them. I would never use this on my disabled son even though he is an adult. Additionally, I don't like the smell and on me it doesn't fade.This is a \"\"no go\"\" for me, although possibly I am being too hard on it. Usually I like Nivea products. This is a rare thumbs down for me to give Nivea.\"", "I had never used a Nivea product before trying this Body Lotion.  I really like it.  I have very dry skin and when I apply this after showering it keeps my skin smooth and silky all day long.  That is really saying something!  It has a very nice fragrance too.  I was very pleasantly surprised  with this product.", "I guess I really don't have much to say about this product. I didn't find it to be a particular stand-out in the lotion department. I don't know if I have to keep using it a certain amount over a certain period of time, but I didn't see any 'skin firming' effect. Perhaps, at 48, my skin is too old and saggy to be firmed up by something as simple as a grocery store body lotion... In addition, it's thinner than I'd have hoped. My skin feels nice with it on but no better (or firmer!) than other lotions that I enjoy using more.", "\"Everyone in my house uses some type of Nivea lotion, so I jumped at the chance to try the skin firming lotion. The smell is light and gentle, not overwhelming. No one in my household (including my kids with sensitive skin) had any negative reaction to using this lotion. It has a very light feel and glides on nicely. I've been using it on my legs and arms for weeks now and my skin is soft as can be. I'm not sure of the \"\"firming\"\" qualities of it, didn't really notice much of a difference from using my other Nivea lotions. I will try to do a comparison and come back to revise my review. But overall I would purchase again, as all Nivea lotions make our skin soft without a greasy feeling or overwhelming scent, making it great for the whole family!\"", "I was hit by a car and completely disabled for two years.  Normally I'm a very active person and a lifetime athlete.  So when I was finally able to return to my head-cracking activities--I have a helmet of course, so I should really call them helmet-cracking activities--I realized that not only did I get fat and weak, but my hair, teeth, and skin had all changed.So at some point in this comeback, I had an odd allergic reaction to suntan lotion which caused dry, itchy, scaly bumps on my arms, shoulders, and back.  Never had this problem in my life.  I guess it's the lack of sweat, because normally I do a lot of outdoor sports and sweat a lot.I saw a dermatologist about it and he prescribed moisturizer--and to stop scratching.  He gave me a bag of sample size Aveeno colloidal oatmeal moisturizer bottles, but it wasn't very effective so I started using Aveeno's more hardcore Eczema therapy moisturizer, which was better but it still only really worked and felt good when I applied it.  Then I tried Nutragena (spelling?  I forget), which was better than Aveeno, but I still felt the need to wash it off after a few hours.Finally I sampled this lotion and never looked back.  It does the job, smells good, feels good, I don't feel the need to wash it off later because it doesn't feel like I spread cake frosting on myself as I did with the others, and it's even decent on my face.The scent is very clean.  It doesn't smell like perfume, or flowers, or potpourri.  This may be the only product which has a 'unisex' smell.  It reminds me of fresh talc, but it doesn't feel like chalk.Good stuff.  Both my wife and I are using it after showering and we both prefer it to other products we've tried.", "\"It's a pretty lightweight lotion with a very strong scent. The scent is perfumey strong, and not all that pleasant. I haven't noticed any \"\"firming\"\" of my skin at all, and made sure to use it daily anywhere that I felt is a \"\"problem\"\" area. Also, this lotion is way too lightweight for me, the moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough, even initially upon application, let alone after an hour or two. This product does not seem to be up to normal Nivea standards, very disappointing.\"", "I found Nivea Q10 Skin Firming lotion to be both well absorbed and neutral in fragrance.  It left a nice smooth finish to my skin with no greasy feeling.  And I have to admit, my skin felt more hydrated than usual and perhaps that lead to my feeling a bit firmer on my arms and chest.  I can't say I saw a visual difference but I also don't have a lot of wrinkles in those areas either.Bottom line, this is a nice moisturizer with maybe some skin firming effects.", "For having such a rich texture, this lotion absorbs into my skin fairly well with only a minimal amount of sticky feeling left over. It has a baby-lotion kind of smell which is not offensive or overwhelming like other products seem to go for these days.I've been applying it twice a day for the past 5 days and have noticed that my neck and chest area do not apear as dry as in the past. The results on my arms and legs have also been really good. It's no miracle worker (yet), but I'm very satisfied with what I'm seeing so far.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the package indicates it is some kind of skin firming lotion and that to really experience these results, you need to be using it for 2 weeks or more.  So, I guess I'll be back in the next 10 days to give an update.  However, for the time being this is working out to be a better than average body lotion (especially for the price) and if there is any other additional benefits and/or improvements to my skin, I will consider this to be icing on a very lovely cake.", "I have never used a Nivea lotion before so I was happy to give this one a try. I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand I wasn't impressed. It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent (another turn off for me, I usually lean towards the fruity smelling lotions). This is something they should put on the bottle, I had assumed it was unscented. The scent lingered on my body for several hours after putting it on. The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour. In the winter time this would be a plus but with the heat and the humidity of the summer it is no good.", "I was eager to try the Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion due to past experiences with Nivea products. I was not at all pleased with the nauseating scent of this lotion. Also, I did not notice any skin firming action either. Not a great deal at $17.00 dollars for a pack of two 13.5 FL ounces.", "I love Nivea hand lotion and so decided to try this skin firming lotion with Q10 plus, which I had no idea what this was.  I have been using this lotion all week, I have not noticed any firming on my skin but do notice how moisturized it is and love how this lotion smells.  I am sure one week may not be enough time for the firming to take place, and I am going to keep using this to see how that works.  The bottle says it may take up to 2 weeks for any firming so we will see. I hope so because bathing suit season is just around the corner and I can use any help I can get. I would definitely recommend this lotion regardless of the firming properties, it comes in a nice big pump bottle, smells great and is very moisturizing.", "I received this Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion through amazon on the vine. I really loved this product. It isn't greasy at all and has a light fresh scent. The scent is stronger when you first put it on but it definitely dissipates after a few minutes and is barely noticeable. The lotion is easy to put on, no streaking it absorbs in nicely. It instantly hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling so smoothe and soft. The effect it has on your skin lasts a whole day. When I wake up the next morning my skin still feels soft from the moisturizer. My skin tends to get dry and sometimes even flaky and this Nivea has really made a huge difference. No more dry skin!! As far as firming goes, my skin may seem a little firmer but don't expect miracles. However, I will be buying more and would highly recommend this product."], "A": [0.03416845202445984, 0.037729911506175995, 0.03787947818636894, 0.028976691886782646, 0.03769815340638161, 0.03410627692937851, 0.022955231368541718, 0.01917322538793087, 0.03860119357705116, 0.03605610877275467, 0.03401868790388107, 0.036537863314151764, 0.038172245025634766, 0.036882974207401276, 0.035255104303359985, 0.03275684267282486, 0.03389580175280571, 0.034861255437135696, 0.024378228932619095, 0.03132693096995354, 0.019116898998618126, 0.03455881401896477, 0.035919904708862305, 0.021954091265797615, 0.03161164000630379, 0.023109566420316696, 0.019651640206575394, 0.02826290763914585, 0.03667951375246048, 0.02601594664156437, 0.027765363454818726, 0.02992306835949421]}
