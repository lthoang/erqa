{"reviews": ["\"I bought this because I was jealous of my wife's Creative Zen 8 GB player.But really, I bought this because of the promised X-Fi sound quality.  I have an X-Fi audio card for my desktop PC and I really love the enhanced MP3 sound quality and was hoping for more of the same in a portable unit.  The Creative Zen X-Fi does not disappoint, straight out of the box I found the sound to be full of the bass tones I love so much.  The X-Fi settings add some nice quality to my tones and vibrate my little eardrums with heavy beats.  With the included headphones the bass was almost overwhelming for me, but with my Bose Triport IE's I found the sound to be very satisfying.So lets get down to brass tacks here.  So far here's what I love:*)  The new iPhoney sleek look is very nice, an improvement I think.*)  The buttons have a nice tactile feel.  With very little practice I can easily find the play button and volume adjustment without looking.  Visually its a little harder to figure out which button is where.*) Even better, the buttons never get pressed unintentionally.  This is a big plus since I use it for working out and yard work where I'm often bending over; my clix was constantly getting paused or fast forwarded unintentionally which has been a constant source of annoyance!*)  I found it virtually effortless to hook this up to my PC, connect to my existing MediaMonkey library and download all of my songs and playlists.*)  Great sound for bass lovers.  X-fi crystallizer makes for a crisper quality if thats what you like.*)  Wi-fi connection, hooked up to my network easily and I was browsing the Creative Media Center in minutes.*)  Very lightweight compared to most of my other players.*)  User Interface: If you are familiar with Creative players then you will find the buttons easy to understand and use.  I find the basic menu system easy to understand and navigate.  Lots of nice background images to choose from.*)  Easy firmware update, I downloaded the latest firmware from Creative website and easily installed it.*)  Decent headphones included -- possibly the best I've ever seen packaged with an MP3 player.*)  Lightweight, easy to carry, seems to be pretty rugged construction, fits nicely in a pocket.*)  Nice battery life:  compared to my Clix 2 (4 ish hours) or my iPod Touch (about same!) this thing lasts forever at about 10ish hours.*)  Big bold colorful screen, which I find easy to read even in daylight.*)  I love the way it pops right back to where I left off even after a power off, it comes right back to the Now Playing screen and resumes my playlist.  Most of my other players don't do this very well so its a plus when it works the way I think it should.And the things that are not so great:*)  Well, as is the \"\"case\"\" with many non-Apple players, accessories are not easy to come by.  This seems to be a bit thicker than its predecessor so I don't think the old Zen cases are going to fit very well.  Also, the power button has been moved to the back of the player which will mean you need a special case to be able to access the power button.  As of this writing, I can't find a single X-Fi leather case out there, not even from Creative.  -- Update: I just ordered a leather case direct from Creative, hoping its a good one! Update: Found an i-nique case which is very nice, with the only problem being hard to access that power button on the back... still waiting for the perfect case!Thats about it, I highly recommend this player as a heck of a lot of MP3 player for the price (I paid more for my 8GB Clix 2 and a lot more for my 16B Touch!). In many ways I like it better than the Clix 2 although the Clix does have the crispest sound I've ever heard from a player.  The Touch of course is a wonderful unit but it is bigger, heavier and more expensive.\"", "Got this as a gift and what a piece of JUNK!  I wanted the iPod, but my significant other didn't want to jump on the bandwagon and really pushed me in the direction of the Creative.  I wish I hadn't been so easily swayed.  This thing stinks.  I had a Creative MP3 player before this (in fact my significant other and I had the same one) and I loved it.  It is about 5 years old now and still working - I would use it regularly, but it doesn't hold much music and the screen is so tiny.Any way...I have had nothing but technical problems with this thing since I got it.  The buttons are possessed and work when they see fit.  Very irritating when you are trying to turn down the sound, skip tracks, or use the other function on the player.  I have loaded and reload the software several times and run numerous recovery programs on it.Ultimately, Creative jerked me around for over a month and then never responded to my warranty claim.  I finally found a phone number for them that worked (they do not do phone customer service, email is the preferred method) and they said they had no record of my claim and there was nothing they could do.If you are seriously considering buying from them you should think about customer service and its importance.  This is not an accessible company.  If you type Creative Lab customer service into a search engine you will see the numerous complaints against them.  If you are fortunate enough to get a product that is not faulty I am jealous of you.  I will never buy a Creative product again.", "I had the Zen Vision M and then the regular Zen, without X-Fi. I'm a fan of Zen's, and this one is extremely cool in every way. The ear buds are phenomenal!!  The user interface is excellent, the color screen is nothing short of fantastic - though a little small, (but usable - I watched a 2 hour movie on it and had no issues; and my sight is bad) - and having a radio, expandable SD slot and built-in speaker (!!!), plus the extraordinary X-Fi sound and, for the money, you can't beat it.Unfortunately, I ended up returning it, for one reason: I like watching recorded TV shows during my long flights.  The Zen was fine for this, but I was seduced by the extra inch size of the iPod Touch, plus all the apps I could run on it.  The only downsides to the Touch (2nd Gen) are the lack of expandable memory - a bummer, but not something I can't live without, given the 32gb model - and the much-hated, (by me, at least), iTunes.  Or more the vice-grip it puts on you in terms of ease of getting music on and off your various computers.  That's the reason I went to Zen in the first place.  But, now that you can get software that gets around the iTunes issue, I'm cautiously optimistic about it.The Touch is another $120, at least, and you're stuck with 32gb's; but, it's about as cool as you can get.  It's more of a PDA than the Zen.For those wanting just music and ocassional vids on their MP3 player, you truly can't go wrong with the Zen X-Fi.  And everything runs fine straight off the SD card.BTW: After ordering the Touch, I went and TRIED to buy the EP-830 ear buds that came with the Zen X-Fi, but they aren't available yet, except from Creative directly.  I ended up buying the Creative Auravana in-ear models - which used to be $99 but can be gotten for $59 on Amazon - and I have to say that I PREFER the EP-830's!!  I returned the Auravana's and bought the $49 EP-830's direct from Creative.Good luck with your X-Fi.  You're gonna love it!!!", "\"Well, this is a semi-solid Creative product.  It size is a nice change, very nice video quality and superior sound quality.  As said before, the x-fi technology is kinda a gimick... the basic sound improvement comes from the sethoscope-like headphones that seal out alot of background noise, and do provide higher highs, and amazingly lower lows.  I\"\"m thinking its more the headphones that the technology.The software isnt that bad... anyone with mediocre computer experience should be able to do well with it.The player itself is teh problem... it seems cheaply built. While the light plastic used contributes to the light weight, it just seems cheaply made.  The silver paint on the back of the unit is easily scratched off.  For nearly $300, I'd expect a more durable player.So, for now, I would suggest buying the new X-fi earphones... but maybe reconsider on the player ;)\"", "A nice player overall.  The main drawback is that it does not play protected AAC files that you buy from itunes.  So if you buy from iTunes regularly, dont buy this player as you will have to convert all of your music into a mp3, which is not as easy as you'd think.  The battery life is also not as long as advertised.  When I was studying at a coffe shop for approximately 9 hours or so with the X-fi and X-fi surround on, it was down to about 25% of the battery life left.  Unless it has a Seinfeldian type of gas tank on it, it would go about 12 hours with music.  Putting the lock on may help as that shuts the screen down, but my player was stolen right after I figured that out.The headphones are extremely nice.  The voice recorder is extremely clear.  The speaker on the outside is nice, but probably finds little use generally, but nice to have I guess. I am not sure how the Wi-Fi works, but it seems rather limited with what it can do.  If you could tap into shoutcast radio, like on Winamp or something, that would be ideal, but I never used the Wi-Fi feature.  It seemed like a feeble attempt at something like the Zune with its sharing.", "I believe this is better than the Ipod, in my opinion. I believe the serious MP3 Player enthusiast will appreciate a player like this. Not many people do their research and think the Ipod are the end all of player. I challenge them to find an Ipod that plays FM radio, built in MIC, multiple video and audio format. Can display picture and has the ability to get on a wireless lan and stream audio and video files. I mean, this device has a plethora of features that truly make a worthy opponent to the iPod.Pros: Multiple video and audio support, wireless lan capabilities, built in FM turner, MIC, built in speakers, premium headphones included.Cons: Weak FM Radio signal at times, some album art don't tag properly, packaged software sucks.Overall, this is a great player, I am satisfied. Sold an iPod nano 4th gen to get this.", "\"Zen X-Fi 16GB review 2-28-09Had the Zen X-Fi 16GB for two months of daily use now.The device is well built and solid. It needs a silicon skin for protection, though. That is extra but highly recommended so your expensive player doesn't slip out of your pocket.First, the buttons are too flat and are not illuminated. Sounds like a small thing, but flat black metal buttons against a black metal background in the car at night are very difficult to find and press. If the buttons were transparent and had the tiniest LED behind them, they would be a lot easier to manipulate accurately.No Bluetooth--I'm getting very tired of wired connection to my car and headphones. LOSE THE WIRES, Creative! The earphones that come with the Zen are terrific. Really good quality. But the wires are tiresome.Though I'd rather have Bluetooth, Zen is Wi-Fi capable. You can wirelessly hook to your computer's wireless router and play or copy files back and forth, but it's so frustrating to make it function it's virtually useless. USB cable is the way to connect.As part of Wi-Fi, Creative does provide something called \"\"Media Server\"\" that you can access via your internet connection wireless router if you're in range and properly connected. After waiting a couple of minutes for the connection to be made, you can listen to propaganda from all kinds of politically correct content like NPR, the BBC, Australia's ABC and KCRW. Yes, master: I hear and obey. Mostly a waste as you can't really select content you want, only what they supply. Definitely politically correct. And boring.It has a kind of chat texting capability but that's what phones are for these days and the Zen's dinky keyboard just doesn't cut it. The keyboard is laid out the way it is so it can emulate a phone keypad when you're in chat mode. Too frustrating to use. It's why QWERTY keyboards are on phones now.Bookmarks. A few minutes after being shut off, the Zen forgets where you were when you shut down. If you fire it up an hour after shutdown or dock it to your computer to upload new content, it starts playing the last file you opened from the beginning. This is a bit frustrating when you're part way through a three hour podcast. So Creative allows you to set a Bookmark from within the file you are playing. It's quick and easy once you figure it out. I use it all the time now. This allows you to set a point in a podcast so you can return to it later. But while you can set the bookmark from within the file, you have to navigate to the Bookmarks screen to select the bookmark when playing back later. Not very intuitive. Took me two months to realize the usefulness of the feature. Why doesn't it simply remember where I stopped listening by itself? My DVR does. Just resume from where I left off. But no.The lower left button is programmable. It's called My Shortcut. You pick from a list of available functions and set it. This allows you to go to a particular favorite screen or function once you decide what that is.The Zen first and foremost is marketed as a video and MP3 player. What I wish it could do is have a \"\"skip forward\"\" ability (again, like my DVR does) that allows me to skip forward 30 seconds or a minute (or a user defined amount) so I can move forward in predictable amounts instead of holding the fast forward button down.  If it's going to be called a \"\"player\"\" of any sort, it should have a variety of player controls. Skip forward/back should be available. Firmware upgrade wish, Creative.Speaking of the fast forward button, the longer you hold it, the faster it goes. It starts by forwarding at a slow rate, then speeds up until you are jumping forward minutes at a time. This is good for zooming to a point quickly. But if you want to go forward, say, seven minutes, holding the FFwd button down too long will launch it into hyperdrive and you'll be at 10 minutes or more into the file, then have to rewind/search back. Somewhat of a pain. No. A real pain. Let me skip forward or back in 30 second increments.A great feature is its built-in speaker. It sounds like my transistor radio from my childhood. This feature was the main reason I bought the Zen: you don't have to use earphones if you don't want to. It is a great and rare feature among MP3 players. A pocketable mini boombox.Creative's Centrale \"\"iTunes wannabe\"\" software is dreadful. I tried it for awhile, then uninstalled it and now just drag files to the device.Video screen quality is very good but 320x240 is still a bit small. Diagonally it's 2-1/2\"\"; 2\"\" wide x 1-5/8\"\" high. It's also the old 4:3 aspect ratio, not the modern 16:9. If you're viewing a 16:9 video letterboxed, you are looking at one tiny video.The video player (as opposed to the music player) is very weak. Windows Media Player 11 it ain't. Another key reason I bought the Zen is because it promised it could play a plethora of video formats. Wrong. I have dozens of wmv video files which exist in many sizes and bitrates from thumbnails to HD. Unfortunately, almost all of them need to be converted via Creative's stand-alone converter app or Centrale into squeezed-down bitrates and 320x240 size. This process is clumsy and slow.If virtually every file needs to be converted in order to play, it's not really playing the advertised list of formats: it's playing the format Creative has selected and must be converted to. Often, even if I render out a wmv directly from my video editing software to Creative's parameters, it still won't play properly without conversion. Yet another marketing promise dashed to pieces.The Zen allows me to delete files directly from the Zen if I want to (as opposed to needing to plug into iTunes to delete or add). This is good.It has a built in mic and audio recording capability and you can program the \"\"My Shortcut\"\" button to start the recording process immediately so you don't have to navigate to the recorder's controls.It has an FM radio that only works if the ear phones are plugged in because the wire becomes the antenna. What I'd really like is an AM radio, though, for news, talk radio, traffic and weather. Who needs FM? That's what your MP3's are for in the first place, right?The unit has an SD card slot, but it's not well integrated. Content on the SD card does not appear in the normal file list. You must navigate to the card and browse it separately. Worse, when you do that, it comes back with \"\"There are no playable files in this folder\"\" even when I know I put mp3 files on the card that the player can play. You have to use the \"\"Import\"\" function to move files from the SD card to the player's memory in order to play them. Think of the SD card as an aux thumb drive, not as expanded memory, except it doesn't even work like that, actually. If you think you can buy the 16GB and \"\"double\"\" its memory capacity with a card, think again. It's more of a gimmick than a useful feature. More Creative fluff that is long on promise but short on delivery.By the way, when you plug the Zen into your computer's USB cable the Zen does not mount as a drive (what Windows calls a \"\"Local Disk.\"\") It \"\"docks\"\" as a \"\"Portable Media Player\"\" according to Type in Windows Explorer. This means you can't play directly from the player. If you click on a file on the Zen from within Windows, it moves the file to a temp folder on your C: drive before playing. Not a big deal, but if you intend on connecting the Zen to a USB input on your car stereo or computer, I don't think your stereo will be able to see the Zen's contents. While the Zen is docked to the computer, all the play buttons are disabled and the display indicates \"\"Docked\"\" until you unplug the device. On the other hand, you don't have to unmount the device. Just pull from the USB and go.Poor Creative. Always trying. Never quite getting there. Won't be long now and a phone will do it all. Look at Sony Erickson's W760, iPhone or Palm Pre.\"", "I bought this player after reading many reviews claiming it was one of the best if not the very best mp3 players out there -- in particular with respect to sound quality.Unfortunately, my experience says otherwise. My unit has an unfortunate sibilance / harshness problem around 1-3k that just drives me crazy. I have tried a couple different sets of headphones and the issue is still there. I don't consider myself a super audiophile, but I was expecting more. My old 3G ipod did not have this problem.I don't know if this is a problem my individual player or the design, but it's kind of a deal killer for me.That aside, the features are pretty cool, and most everything works.+ The video playback is excellent- The UI is just okay. The buttons are pretty small. The corner buttons of the keypad are a waste- I don't know what to make of the wifi feature. When I'm home and have access to my wifi, I turn the stereo on. It would be neat if it could work from just any old hotspot, but that's just not the case.- The software that comes with the unit... meh. I tried out various alternatives, and chose MediaMonkey, which works pretty well for me. In particular, I wanted software that would manage a lot of podcasts for me.- The video converter software works okay, but is crazy slow. It also crashes on one of my computers but not another. I have switched to using the mplayer/mencoder (linux freeware, but windows binaries available), and it is only slightly faster, but much more flexible (you have to be willing to hit the command line to make best use of mencoder, but it will encode whole DVDs, for example)+ it's small and light+ battery life is admirable. I plug the unit in to sync my podcasts and that pretty much takes care of my charging needs for day to day use+ picture browsing is cool- The SD card slot is good, but the integration with your music library is not there. Actually, it's just handled totally separately, and even browsing to the SD card stops whatever was playing from your normal library. Annoying. I use the SD card to hold DVDs I've converted, so this limitation is not too annoying because my 8GB card can only hold 25 movies or so, anywaySo, in summary. It's not an Apple product, which is nice. Size and battery are nice. Screen: also nice. It's got lots of features and the video is good, which is also nice. No problem playing any of the music I threw at it. The UI is just okay. Wi-Fi, only useful if you're at home running their media server. Finally, the sound: very disappointing.", "Try this player at your own risk...Works for some, not others.My 3rd Creative player. Have the ZenV:M and Vision. No issues with these players, nearly flawless syncing/playing.This player failed in many ways. Syncing was hit or miss. Sometimes it would skip files, sometimes it would shut down after transferring files. I had to format the player 3 times before I finally decided to return it.Bottom line is features, framework, software are irrelevant if the player does not perform reliably.I have a Sony E348 now and am very happy. Looks like Creative will have to design a player that exceeds all their current standards before they win me back.", "\"The MP3 player worked for a week and then nothing. Creative Labs has \"\"international\"\"(India) support which is worthless and slow. On the other hand Amazon returns was Fast and GREAT. They supplied me with the return label and my card was credited in days! I will continue to shop with Amazon!\"", "This is a wonderful mp3 player and has many features.  I really like being able to have my contacts available on it.  Sound is great.  Wish they used a different software with more playlist options. Player feels strong and well made.", "\"If you are looking to buy an mp3 player and are on a shoestring budget, I would advise you to get an iPod shuffle. This was my first Creative mp3 player and possibly my last. There are a variety of options but their effectiveness is lackluster because the intuitiveness and interface is below par. It all ends up looking very \"\"china made\"\"Why did I buy this?I wanted to try something else. There were cool features and the price wasn't sky high.I have nothing encouraging to say about this product.\"", "Pros:- Ideal screen size and colors- Speaker- FM Radio- Microphone (recorder)- SD Slot (up to 16 GB SDHC card)- WiFi for MSN/Yahoo Chat and Media content- X-Fi: Enhance low quality music- High quality in-ear earphones- Great value for the Price!Cons:- No button backlight- Fingerprint magnet screen- Creative Centrale. Not a great software for video (AllToAVI is a good free alternative)- No wall adapter included- No pouch (or skin) included- 2 inches USB cable (useful if you have a laptop)-----I bought the 16GB model from about a month, and this is my experience so far.Videos: You've to convert them up to 320x240 pixels (MPEG, DivX, XviD or WMV). I use AllToAVI (it's free) to convert the videos (Creative Centrale doesn't work very well).Music: Low quality music (128 kbps or less) improves a lot with the X-Fi feature, but higher quality songs sounds kinda strident (so you can turn the X-Fi off if that's the case). The speaker and earphones volume is very good.Earphones: The in-ear earphones have 3 different sizes, I use the smaller ones. Sound nice and don't cause discomfort like normal earphones.Photos: Work nicely. It could be improved adding more flexible rotation. You can rate photos.SD Slot: The SD slot is great (although not integrated to the main libary) and you can transfer your JPG photos from your camera to the player for example, if you have to.WiFi: Chat for MSN/Yahoo. Writing text is kinda slow but not impossible (it should have a feature to add common phrases in order to save time writing). You can use TVersity to stream video (of any size) from your computer or watch live TV (Google it for more info)Radio: Works well with strong FM radios and with the earphones (antenna) pluged in. You can set names to radio stations.Voice Recorder: It works well with interviews for example. If you want to record distant sounds, the ambient sounds can interfere.Battery Life: With music only, the battery last a lot.. I've not measured the time (X-Fi reduces the duration). I've not tested watching a whole movie, but the WiFi (chating) drains the battery some more than watching videos (I noticed that one time I chatted some time with the device).Is a nice little player in my opinion. Has a lot of features for a great price, music and videos sound and look great. The WiFi could be improved for the chat (a browser could be added but only for WAP in my opinion). The buttons are kinda hard to press but later you can handle it (maybe a problem for thick fingers?). The back of the player is of a kinda weird and slippery plastic... but not a big dealIn other thoughts, I have an older Zen Micro (5GB, B&W; Screen).. and I still prefer that touchpad to control the interface. Is great to have the wall adapter of that player that also works with the ZEN X-Fi, and also the pouch. I recommend to buy the silicon case (it should be a included in the original package!) and the screen protector to avoid fingerprints and scratches over the screen and buttons.I would give this player 4.5/5 but Amazon only let me put 4 or 5 stars, so 5 it is since is more close to it.", "I have no doubt that it is the sound of perfection, the greatest sounding MP3 player ever. I own the original Zen and find that the quality is great but as I got Soundblaster extremegamer x-fi, I know there is room for improvement. I hope to see the Zen with built-in speaker and here it is! I hope to see X-fi integrated to Zen and here it is! I hope to get longer battery life and here it is! I hope to get 32GB at greatest value prices (bundle with high quality earbuds EP-830) and here it is! When I bought this (from Creative in Singapore at S$399 the day it was released) and load my songs in, with X-fi crystalizer ON, X-fi expand ON (some people don't like surround, so you can off it), paired with EP-830, the music is even better, louder, ups and downs better, better bass without distortion, the best that you can get so far. The wireless streaming feature and instant messaging (wifi) is a plus but I have yet to seriously use them. There is no internet browser. The 9 button is comfortable to press and improves navigation over the original Zen. It is slightly thicker than Zen, but it looks and feels more high class due to the sliver backing and chrome edge and the slightly heavier mass. Overall, it is a great improvement over the original Zen and offers better value and full package for sound of perfection (EP-830 with X-fi and Zen quality). You can also buy a docking station with built-in rechargeable battery (not yet available) that also charges Zen X-fi. Will update once I got more results on wireless features.", "\"I bought the Nomad Zen NX about 5 years ago and it still works great. However, it is relatively big and heavy, and that's why I decided to upgrade now. Other players I considered were the Zune 120gb and the iPod 120gb but the Zune lacks an equalizer which was a dealbreaker for me and the iPod only has equalizer presets -- no customization. So I went for the Zen X-Fi 32gb and I'm glad I did. It lacks the capacity of the other two players, but the SD slot sort of makes up for it, even though it isn't well integrated with the internal memory. Also, SD prices have been falling fast, so I can see 32gb SD cards being sold for a reasonable price in the not too distant future. And this Zen is considerably smaller than those other two devices which is a big plus for me.The sound quality is very good.  I like that it has a customnizable button to configure however you like. I assigned the volume control to it since that isn't directly available via another button in all screens. Now I can more easily access it at all times.FM reception in my area is superb, with little distortion or static. I think it will depend on where you live. In NY City, it's great.As for syncing, I am using the J River Media Center. It syncs fine with the Zen X-Fi and I prefer it to the non-intuitive Centrale software.The Centrale software bundled with the device is not totally useless. For one thing, it installs a help file on your PC that's a lot more detailed than the Quick Start guide that comes in the package. You should install Centrale at least for the help file. After you copy it elsewhere, you may be able to uninstall Centrale if you want. However it's harmless and I think uninstalling it might remove some of the needed drivers your PC may require in order to recognize the Zen X-Fi.  You can also re-format the player using Centrale.Speaking of drivers, there is a Windows glich that prevented my Windows XP machine from initially recognizing my Zen x-Fi so I couldn't update the firmware or sync.  I tried re-installing the Creative software and updating the drivers through Windows device manager but I kept getting this error message -- \"\"A service installation section in this INF is invalid.\"\" A google search came up with the solution. If this happens to you, do a google search on that error message and follow the link to myCreative Fansite. In the first post is the answer -- A missing umdf file -- and a link to download it.  The solution is really simple and worked like a charm, and my Zen is now fully recognized by my PC and the Creative software. It is not Creative's fault as this is happening to users of other MP3 players who are on Windows as well.The headphones are terrific and are far far better than the stock headphones that come with most players. I had planned to sell them on eBay since I have a few sets of earbuds already, but I'm going to keep them now as they have a nice rich sound and work well with this player.  They are fairly easy to drive too so you can keep your volume on the Zen low which means your battery should last longer. For example, if I am listening with these headphones with the volume set to 7, I might have to set the volume level at 15 to get the same loudness using my Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds.You also get a nice hard plastic case to store all the little papers and accessories that came with the player.To clear up something a recent reviewer said .... once you have the correct drivers installed from the CD that comes with the unit (and apply any Windows fix if you have the umdf issue like I did), you do NOT have to go through Creative's Centrale software to get files into this player. It will show up as a separate drive instantly when you connect. Just click on My Computer to access it and you can browse the folder structure and drag and drop files. This is an additional way to load music files along with other alternate options such as Windows Media Player or J River Media Center.I would have given this player 5 stars if not for the poor integration of the SD card with the internal memory. I also really wish they had volume and pause hardware controls on the SIDE of the player which would allow one to control them even with a closed leather case. My Zen NX has this. With the Zen X-Fi you have to open the covers of the leather cases to get to the volume and pause controls. Because of this, I might simply go with a hard plastic case with cutouts or a silicone skin.Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase.  As I said, this little player is almost perfect.\"", "I have to admit a bias upfront.  I have always bought Creative products.  My thinking was that they made fantastic sound cards, they took the knowledge and put it into the MP3 Players.I got this for my oldest son for Christmas, as his older Zen version was running rapidly out of room.  We got a 4 MB one for him 5 years ago.  He is now downloading more and more music every day, and needed space.2 things I love about this MP3 player-the sound quality, and the screen.The sound quality is fantastic.  The X-FI system is really superior to any of the previous Zens, as well as other MP3 players that I have listened to over the years.  (My youngest was different and wanted an IPod Touch.  It is a neat thing, but I am not too crazy about the sound quality)The screen has a great resolution, and videos downloaded to it play clear.Others have complained about the clunky software Creative provides.  Yes, it is clunky, but it is easy to understand and work with.  Plus, there are other programs out there that you can use to convert Audio and Video just as easily.We have only started to experiment with WiFi, connecting up to the network I set up in our house.  I will have to update as we conduct a couple of other experiementsOverall, a great MP3 player!", "\"I've owned some of the best there is:Zune HD 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Black),Apple iPod touch 8 GB (3rd Generation) NEWEST MODEL, and now this one.  I can safely say that one is really not \"\"better\"\" than the other - it's all a matter of what you intend to do with the device.  When you boil it down to its core, you need to find out exactly what you want - and then get that device, even if it's not necessarily the most 'popular' of them all.I'd been using my Blackberry Storm as a media player.  For the record I only needed such a device to funnel audio out to my car as my current car does not have iPod or other inputs, nor does it have USB or flash inputs.  That only leaves me with Line In - opens up the possibilities, limits the coolness.  I don't watch videos on the go except on my netbook, so I don't need a small video player.  I don't use it as a picture device; the Storm can handle that.  Same for a voice recorder.  I only need it for music.  The problem with the iPod Touch is that it's essentially a toy: a device that you can play with all day and lets you do whatever you want without having to carry multiple devices; yet it doesn't really do any one thing all that well.  The Zune HD is a music and video player, and it excels in music management, but it suffers from (A) a price that's a bit iffy for the size, and (B) proprietary connectors and software that are turnoffs for someone on the move like myself, not to mention (C) issues with Wi-Fi that I've spoken to in my other review.Enter the Creative Zen X-Fi.  On Black Friday I decided to buy a media player, and it was going to be one of the aforementioned three.  I settled on the X-Fi because it seemed to offer everything I needed: A way to get a bunch of music portable and accessible with a reasonable price point, in an attractive form factor.  It's already more than proven it's up to the task, being able to continuously play music on a 10 hour drive and still have more than 3/4ths power remaining.  The audio quality is comparable to what I would get playing the music from an MP3 CD, which is about what I expected to get.  It also has a built-in speaker, and others have commented that the speaker quality sucks.  I don't agree.  If X-Fi is on, the speaker sounds quite robust to be so small (which makes you wonder why they can't use the same technology in cell phone speakers).  It's not going to rock a party, but it's more than sufficient to have sitting by your desk to play some music without earphones.  I did have some issues which I will speak to, but for now I'm satisfied with the device on the whole.  I find it to be worth the price I paid.=- What the Zen X-Fi Does RIGHT -=- Small form factor, easy to carry, easy to obscure- Attractive design- Most attractive packaging I've ever seen- Uses standard mini USB to communicate, sync and charge- Support for connecting to media servers wirelessly- Mass Storage and software sync support - you can drag and drop files or use WMP, WMC, TVersity, etc. to sync your files- Native support in Windows 7; it will show up in Devices and Printers as a Zen X-Fi, no external driver needed, with full connectivity- Audio quality is quite superior to the iPod Touch in my opinion.  Zune HD is higher on the scale, but does not have the external speaker- Lots of memory AND an SD card slot to go even higher=- What the Zen X-Fi Does WRONG -=- The included earbuds look fantastic but sound horrific.  I mean, they sound worse than the built-in speaker.  That's sad.- No apparent support for shuffle play within a genre.  For example, if I select a genre, it won't allow me to play songs in random order, only alphabetically.- No backlight.  The front interface seems to scream for it, yet it is not here.- Button placement is rather haphazard.  Play/Pause is on the bottom right - no problems there, but then navigation buttons are an odd array of 9 metal buttons with no markings to tell you what they do or how to use them.  When you navigate you're using the center crosshair buttons, and if you're in the dark, you have to \"\"feel\"\" it out.  Very annoying.  Also, when trying to type something in, you have to use these same navigation buttons, and instead of a cellphone-like manner, they're...I can't describe it.  Trust me that it's uncomfortable.- Navigation buttons are a tad bit hard to press.  I don't know why they didn't make them clear acrylic like the other four music buttons.- Album art won't show up unless you sync with software (i.e. you can't drag and drop).  This is a bit troubling, since the artist/song information doesn't change either way.  That the device is not smart enough to go get it at the time you drag and drop it, seems like a very small thing that was overlooked.  For the record, I drag and drop because it's faster than sync, plus I'm not then held hostage to that software if I need to make changes to my musical makeup.- Videos require sync (you can use Windows 7, doesn't have to be Creative's software, but still), even though their native formats (WMV, MP4, MPG) are supported by the device.  Why can't I just drag and drop them??  The sync takes 5 times as long to complete!  I mean I love that it's got so many formats it supports and all, but it really should support drag and drop all the way around.  Seriously.  I don't even use the feature and this is the primary reason why - too much hassle.- No included wall charger.  At all.  You have to charge on a computer or buy a charger.  I *think* a mini USB charger like the one for the BlackBerry Pearl might work, but I've never tried it.So...do I recommend it?  At its current price it is definitely a solid product...but it does have issues.  For someone who only needs to be able to play music it's light years ahead of the competition.  IF you're the kind of person who is a 24-hour device head, get the iPod Touch.  If you're the kind of person who wants to sync his media with his computer and his 360, get the Zune HD.  The Creative Zen X-Fi is a 5 star music player, a 4 star device, and that's what this review is trying to tell you.\"", "\"After my Zen Vision M 60GB Personal Video Player (PVP) died, decided on replacing it with a similar.  Ordered from Amazon the Zune 120 because of the great reviews it had.  To my surprise and in spite of its 120 GB capacity, the Zune was perhaps the biggest disappointment (read my review) in technology from MSFT.  I returned the Zune and quite hesitantly, ordered the Zen X-FI 30 GB model; the one with the highest capacity from Creative Labs, plus a couple of SD cards.  Creative stopped production of their HDD based Vision M and Vision W series (ZVMs) and now all their PVPs are made with chips, not rotating platter disks.The Zen X-FI 30GB might be an alternative to consumers that do not expect much video features and are not used to the ZVMs.  If you are familiar with and spoiled by the ZVMs, as I am, stay away from Zunes and the X-FI.  This new Creative gadget has some great things such as the credit card size, the light weight and the internal speaker which is OK for personal listening.  Screen brightness, contrast and detail are comparable with the ZVMs and much better than the Zune.  Unlike the Zunes, your computer will recognize the Creative products as Storage Devices and allow you to drag and drop pics, music and videos.  But the good things end here.While the ZVMs are capable of playing any size of converted movie/video, the X-FI can only play files in 320 x 240 resolution.  Thus, if you are trading your Vision M for an X-FI, prepare your computer to convert all movies into the proper size.  The Creative Centrale and Converter can do this but will take hours.  ZVMs allowed video playback on TVs, monitors and similar devices with the optional cables, the XFI does not.  My 60 GB Vision played continuously five hours of video or up to 12 hours of audio.  The X-FI battery limits actual playback to three hours of video and not more than eight of audio.Now the worst, even though X-FIs have a slot for SD cards, these cards are not recognized as mass storage devices by computers.  Thus, in order to load anything into the cards, they have to be removed from the Zen, installed in a compatible device (GPS, camera or even a card reader/writer), connected to your computer and then trough the Windows Explorer, drag and drop the desired files.  How come a company like Creative allowed this flaw on their flagship PVP?While the ZVM series allows you to modify the picture on their small 2.5\"\" inch screen to suit your preferences with features as Fit to Screen, Stretch to Full, Zoom to Full or Keep the Original size, the X-FI only allows you to Stretch to Full, a useless feature since videos were already converted to 320 x 240.As for the Zunes, not much to say other than they are not recognized as storage device by computers, the screen is dull, has no adjustment capabilities and only plays videos in MP-4 formats.  These formats are twice the size of the AVI format played by Zens.  Other bad things on the Zunes are the short battery life and the mediocre headphones included in such a relatively expensive product.After understanding that the new Zens or even the Zune 120 did not fulfill my video playback expectations I searched for old ZVMs and found that the 60GB versions are being sold as high as $600 in Amazon and $300 plus on E-Bay.  Thus, I ordered a couple of used ones, 30GB working models (for $50) and was able to get an old 60GB from a good friend (which is thicker than the 30GB).  Next month I plan to retrofit the 30 GB slim models with new Hitachi 60GB drives and later the one with the 60GB capacity will get a new Hitachi 100GB disk.  Said disks are the ones used by several laptops and manufactured by Toshiba, Seagate and Hitachi.  On a future article will publish the step by step process on how to increase the storage capacity of the ZVMs.Thus, after having stated the pros and cons of these devices, my advice is:  If you want a player to listen to music mostly, consider the Zune 120.  If you want a player for video playback, take a look at the Archos line.  If you want a player balanced with music and video capabilities plus considerable battery life, look for an old Zen Vision M or Vision W.  The Zen X-FI, although a nice try, is not to the standards of the technology of year 2009.  Good luck on your decision!\"", "\"I just bought the 32 gb zen x-fi, and returned it after 3 days.The UI was a joke & hard to navigate. The software that came with it? Pathetic. the 9 keys? retarded design. The player also froze on me 4 times and i had to do a reset to turn it back on.The software that came with it automatically loaded whatever files were in the \"\"my videos\"\" and \"\"my pictures\"\" and \"\"my music\"\" folders. I have like 200 gb between all 3 folders. So my player was instantly loaded with crap.The video converter was crap to. it took my avi's and cut the resolution in half. But the speaker worked well. The only way I was able to erase everything, was to format the disk. POS. stay away. They need alot of work on this thing.In theory, everything seems great about this player, except for the obvious SD slot shortcomings. But in reality, its not worth the effort.Pros:- SD slot for expandability (though not integrated with players memory)- FM radio- Built In Speaker- Voice Recording- Decent earbuds- Large Screen on compact playerCons:- Craptastic Software- Unfriendly User Interface- Retarded Button design (The previous zen's is much better)- Software FreezesWith a player with this many problems that interfere with regular daily use, Im playing with the thought of just getting an.... (shutter) ... iPod.\"", "Got this for a parent who wants an external speaker mp3 player and it seemed like the best one on the market.Pros:1. Video looks excellent. Clear, crisp video.2. External speaker: as of right now this is the best product (aside from my Iphone) with this function. Volume is loud enough and sound quality is good.3. SD card slot. ipods need this.4. Very nice earbud headphones.5. FM radio. I wish my ipod had this.Cons:1. Video needs to be converted to a Creative Zen format for use. Regular Mpeg4, avi, etc. do NOT work in this player. The description was a bit misleading to me. You should download the standalone converter from Creative.com which works better than the one included in the package.2. Software: itunes is so far superior to this. Interface is slow and not always intuitive.3. Included mini USB cable is the shortest one I have ever seen.I own a lot of ipods and an iphone and this product is really not as good as far as ease of use, feature set, and software.If regular ipods came with external speakers, I would not have bought this.That said, this does play music and video well once you are able to get them onto the player. The music and video sound and look great.", "\"This device started \"\"freezing\"\" and \"\"crashing\"\" from the first second it was turned on.  I returned it to Amazon for a credit which I am still waiting on.\"", "I brought this product 2 years ago, it provides with great audio quality, above average battery life, useful FM radio, and the EP-830 noise-isolating earbuds are way better than most, the only issue i found is related to the SD support, not only the integration is mediocre but I also got randomly lockouts when loading tracks from my SD cards (tried several capacities and brands) and IMHO expandable memory is useless if is not reliable.", "I bought this mostly so I could listen to an audio book and then, if the mood strikes me, I can hear a bit of another audio book or perhaps some music. So the bookmark feature is very important to me. But I need it to resume when I return to the bookmark. It does but not as it should.  The bookmark only resume on the current file, not on a set of files. That means you have to manually play each file or go back and reset things.This is also a hard item to learn how to use. There are no instructions to speak of and if you've never used one, you're in the dark. Moreover, when you charge it with the AC you sometimes have to reset the unit --- it literally dies. Fortunately, you don't lose your content. Just pop a pin in the little reset hole and it's back. But what a total inconvenience that is! And this is with the latest firmware.Moreover, you need a program to tag some audio books and most mp3 files. Many folks already do that but I'm used to just throwing some files on the player and it plays.I also found the player a bit hard to learn and there's little available instructions. If you're used to this sort of player, it's probably a snap. But I'm not and it isn't.The unit also gets smudged unless you have some sort of case or skin for it.For now I give it three stars. The sound quality with earphones is great. The regular speaker is good but not loud enough in most cases. I bought it partly for the external speaker and I find it does have value. Just not as much as I'd hoped.-- Susanna K.
