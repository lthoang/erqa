{"reviews": ["Speakers arrived on time and in good condition.  I'm using speakers to listen to iTunes via wireless connection. Sound is excellent and heat from the amp is not a problem, even when the speakers have been used for several hours.", "The Audioengine A5+ speakers provide outstanding audio right out of the box.  After a reasonable break in period, I am confident that these speakers will sound incredible.  The build quality of the speakers is first-rate.  I am very pleased with these speakers; I upgraded from the Audioengine A2s -- which I really liked.  The A5s do not disappoint (and I am very finicky when it comes to audio quality).  Highly recommended.", "\"I'm so happy, bought this on Amazon and it came in very quick. When I opened the box, it was just a complete \"\"premium\"\" experience, very nice packaging, and I mean for speakers?!? yea.I bought this for my record player, and WOW, the quality is SO GOOD, there's actually BASS coming out of it.This speaker is for my bedroom, and it filled up really well. If you're using it for a bigger room you might want to add a subwoofer to make sure the deep bass doesn't disappear. For my setup, my records sounded amazing and warm and clear, high quality, and three dimensional in a way. I've played ZEDD and some other records with huge bass, this thing delivered with much confidence.*THIS DO GET REALLY LOUD with very little to no distortion at all.Design wise? it's clean, just how I like it, very \"\"Apple\"\" like but this is a speaker! so you can feel the premium quality. I got the black version and it looks great beside my turntable, most importantly it doesn't take much space - it's not a small desktop speaker either.I really like the size, feel and weight of this pair!I totally recommend this Audioengine A5+ for you who are looking for a very nice speaker that deliver good amount of bass for not too big of a room (bedroom, living room, . . .) and produce a great quality, clear sound for your music. For $400 pair of speakers, this is my top #1 and yeap, no other!\"", "Wonderful construction, performance and overall quality. I use these in conjunction with the subwoofer, and sitting in a wooden chair at 50% volume my whole body vibrates with the crystal clear bass. Highs and mids are excellent as well with this set, you do not NEED the subwoofer, but it's very worth it.", "\"I have been an audiophile for over 60 years, have owned many systems and heard even more. These two small (but heavy) speakers really impressed me right out of the box. I set these up in the master bedroom on the occasion of getting a new TV that I wanted to compliment with somewhat better sound. This was to be a secondary system that could provide good sound and music for movies and classical recordings including pipe organ.I was not really interested in going overboard and wanted to be able to connect a Pioneer DV-47A's stereo output directly to the speakers so as to avoid having to have an additional receiver. Fortunately the A5+ allows the connection of two audio sources without the necessity of having to switch between the two sources. So the DV-47A connected to the stereo input and the Samsung Smart TV connected to the mini-plug input.Once I got them hooked up and placed I selected two of my SACD demo records to test the speakers out and see what they could do. My first selection was the Sony recording of \"\"The Four Great Toccatas and Fugues\"\" played by E. Power Biggs (SS87983). This is the most sensational organ recording I have ever heard and provides some of the deepest bass notes of any organ recording I have. The performance on these speakers was nowhere in the league of my main system but did a vastly better job than what I was expecting them to do. I was impressed by the linearity between the midbass and low bass response; there was no appreciable boominess in the midbass and its lower bass range was satisfactorily extended and could be felt in my chest. This was enjoyable listening territory and suggested I could enjoy my organ recordings through this system.The second selection I played was the Telarc \"\"Classics at the Pops\"\" (SACD-60595). I picked out Verdi's Grand March from Aida and it sounded very good indeed. Initially there seemed to be an ever so slight harshness to the high end but it seemed to either rapidly diminish or I just got used to it but it did not interfere with my enjoyment of the music. The A5+ \"\"Setup Guide\"\" warns on page 9 under the heading \"\"Break-in Period\"\", \"\"Your speakers will sound great out of the box and will get better over time. No need to do anything else but listen to them, but give them at least 30 to 50 hours break-in time before doing any critical listening.\"\"The A5+ comes with a remote which has the volume control, a mute, and a sleep mode. The sleep mode is the off/on and effectively turns it off. The nice thing about that feature is one can listen to the TV using only the TV speakers if desired.Everything about these speakers suggests quality construction. I understand one of the differences between the A5 and the A5+ was improved heat dissipation; the heat sink on the back of the powered speaker has an impressive size.The sales price is formidable but the value is definitely there; I do not feel I overspent for the quality received. If you're looking for small, sonically excellent speakers these are worthy of consideration.\"", "Numerous folks that have reviewed these speakers comment that the bass is muddled or overpowering when first using them out of the box.  If one was to review these speakers based only on the first few hours of listening, then I can assure you that this product would be nowhere near as highly regarded as it is.  I have &#62;20 hours on mine and they get sweeter to listen to each time.  Initially, the bass was harsh and even sounded as if the speaker cabinet couldnt tolerate the vibration, but in time, it smoothed itself out and is now a true punch, as advertised.Mids and Highs are spot on.  Vocals are crisp.  These are very well staged monitors.  Anyone who thinks you need a subwoofer to enjoy music may not have yet listened to a set like these before.  I just wish that I had them in my custody sooner.Packaging from Amazon was subpar, but the packaging from Audioengine was stellar and proved impervious to Amazon's oversight.  They are unexpectedly heavy (shipping weight of almost 34 pounds).  They are not small either.  It doesnt matter though.  They more than do the job of the Bose Cinemate 2.1 GS II they just replaced.  At every volume, these are clear and sharp.  The Bose truly shined only at high volume levels, and vocal/speech was also difficult to discern.Whether it be music, speech, movies... these things are great!  Would buy again in a heartbeat.", "These are unquestionably the finest speakers that I've ever owned. After trying out many different speakers from other companies, I purchased these due to the extremely high reviews on Amazon. I connected them to a low wattage Grace Mondo Internet radio and also connected them to an inexpensive Polk PSW-10 sub-woofer. I'm also listening to the music on my iPod Touch through them. The difference between these speakers and others that I tried out is like night and day. In addition, Audioengine is an extremely nice company to do business with and readily answered any and all questions that I had regarding my purchase and the proper way to set them up.All I can say about these speakers is that they are astounding. The sound quality right out of the box is phenomenal. I have them mounted on stands, with the tweeters at ear level and when I turn them on I'm in nirvana. Even without the use of a sub-woofer, the sound produced by these exquisite speakers is simply out of this world, with an abundance of crystal clear sound and just the perfect amount of mid and lower range levels. These speakers easily fill a very large room with abundant, quality sound. The solid bamboo is beautiful to look at and fits nicely with the furniture in my living room.While these aren't inexpensive, I believe that they're worth every penny. I'm no expert when it comes to audio, but I can certainly tell that there's a major difference between these and all of the other speakers that I tried out before buying the A5+'s.When you open the box, instead of being greeted by styrofoam packaging, you'll be delighted to see that Audioengine uses earth friendly packaging material, with no items that are a detriment to our environment. In addition, the company goes out of its way to encase the speakers and power supply in beautiful velvet bags, so as to cause no harm to them during transit. The user manual is straight forward and the speakers can be set up in a matter of minutes. One suggestion that I have, is that if you're going to be using speaker stands that allow you to hide the wiring, you should purchase a 30' roll of 16 gauge speaker wire prior to the arrival of the speakers. The reason for this, is because while the speaker wire is long enough on its own, it's too short if you use the stands for hiding wires. I contacted the company about this, and was told that they would consider putting longer length of speaker wire in the box, as they hadn't thought about the issue with speaker stands. This is a company that not only listens to you, but that truly cares about what you think.The bottom line is that these speakers deserve more than 5 stars, as does the company itself. If you decide to purchase them, you'll undoubtedly be blown away by the sound they produce, just as I was and continue to be. It's hard to believe that they'll sound better than they do now, but after 40 or 50 hours, I'm told the sound will be even more amazing.", "I bought these speakers when I was upgraded from a desk to an office at work.  I routinely listen to music while working.  I was using some Senheiser HD 555 headphones (which are still awesome) with a nuforce uDAC.  Now I have these speakers also hooked up to the nuforce uDAC and they sound incredible. The Bamboo finish is definitely worth the extra price in my opinion.  Everything else in my office is black, so these stand out nicely.", "\"I still have a very, very old Zenith console stereo that has massive speakers and really thumps the floor.  And I run one of my computers through it, so I know that music still has a full range of sound in all of the 1s and 0s on CDs and .mp3 files.  But most speakers available most places are just dreck.  These Audioengines, plugged into a wireless device (like an Apple airport express) will allow you to listen to music like it was meant to be heard.  Your ears will thank you.This rendition of the A5 (the \"\"plus\"\") includes a heat sink on the back to address the overheating issue some had with the earlier version.  What you lose is an AC adapter in back.  But what you gain is confidence that your speakers can handle volume for long periods of time.And, like the Zeniths of old, these babies have some heft.  They give legitimate bass response and true sound through the rest of the audible range of sound.The only drawback is that such sound comes at a hefty price to match.  I still shake my head that I spent this much.  Other things have come down in price significantly since I bought my stereo in college--but not real, honest speakers.  You still have to pay for what you get.So my advice--swallow hard and buy them.  I know, I know.  It's four times what you think they should cost.  But in life, that is the general rule: anything worth having costs four times what you are willing to pay for it.\"", "I'm lazy and almost anything I could say has been said before, so this is going to be short.I'm using these directly out of my MBP's headphone out, and I'm seriously amazed. I'm getting the D1 soon, can't wait to hear the difference, and finally use my speakers with the PS3 using the optical out. Dishonored, anyone?Back to the speakers though, I've got $300 headphones (AKG K550) and the speakers best them easily. The detail and extension is still probably better on the headphones, but the speakers create such a rich, real sound, especially angled correctly towards each ear, that I only use my headphones at night now. I used to listen to them all the time.Basically, as an audiophile with great hearing and aspiring music professional, these are really really nice speakers. The sound is just amazing. I've used them as near-field monitors and for movies in a larger living room, and though they're better up close, they still sound full-range, capable, and detailed at greater distances. The ease of use factor is great. I can move them from room to room really easily.I'm incredibly pleased with these speakers. These are the revision to Audioengine's original, highly-acclaimed A5's, with the heat issue fixed and the sound refined. They produce real bass down to 40hz, if i remember correctly, which is great for the dorm life as I love my bass but I'd be hated if I owned a subwoofer.Great as computer speakers, monitor speakers, social speakers, movie speakers, and hopefully, game speakers as well. I highly, highly recommend them.", "the speakers are absolutely the best I have ever owned. I have some old JBL's in the 80s but never had any studio quality speakers to match them with.", "\"For now this review will be short and sweet because I havent had a chance to really test these yet, because there not broke in. But right out of the box these things are amazing. I also own the a5's so i knew these wouldn't disappoint me.  The clarity is amazing and I can promise you that you wont find a better powered bookshelf speaker until you get in the 8 or 900 dollar range. If you want to really make these speakers shine your going to need a good dac, like the ones I showed in my pictures. A couple of things that really make these stand out from the standard a5's is the new heatsink, wireless remote, advance tuned cabinet with rear-ported waveguide, variable preamp line out, RCA and mini-jack inputs, new stand-mount 1/4\"\" threaded inserts, speaker connector binding posts. After I have listened to these for about 50hrs I will try to do a break in follow up. All I can say is that if you have the money for these, or if your thinking about upgrading from your standard a5's you will not regret it.\"", "I bought a pair of the A2's well over a year ago and love them! Amazing sound for such a small speaker with such a small footprint. After a year or so, I decided I wanted more bass and more sound! Being such a huge fan of the AudioEngine A2's, I couldn't help butt steer directly towards the A2's big brother, the A5+.While the sound is very similar from the A2 to the A5+, the A5+ definitely sounds better, crisper, cleaner, more clarity, especially at higher volumes with less distortion compared to the A2. I think the A2 is more impressive in regards to size:sound and that's what initially amazed me and blew me away about the A2's, however the A5+'s sound is just so amazing that with a USB DAC, quality cables and wires they are a force to be reckoned with all together.The A5+'s bass response is far cleaner, punchier, deeper and better overall which is expected from a bigger speaker. The Mids and Highs on the A5+'s are also better all around from frequency response to clarity.I highly recommend the A2's and the A5+'s, either way you CANNOT go wrong, they are both amazing.-----A2-----SOUND*Highs 4/5*Mids  4/5*Lows  3/5SIZE5/5 - Such a small footprint with such amazing sound is astonishing.BUILD5/5 - These speakers are so very well built and designed, they look and sound amazing.QUICK REVIEWBy far the best speakers I've EVER heard from $200 or less, they even rival speakers twice their costs, such as the B&W; MM-1's. Amazing sound, amazing build, amazing design, all around amazing and audio enthusiasts and audiophiles will not be disappointed. The bass is great for a small speaker, but DO NOT expect earth moving lows/bass from these.-----A5+-----SOUND*Highs 5/5*Mids  5/5*Lows  4/5SIZE5/5 - With a bigger footprint than the A2's but still a great bookshelf or desk size speaker with more than exceptional sound is astonishing.BUILD5/5 - These speakers are so very well built and designed, they look and sound amazing.QUICK REVIEWBy far the best speakers I've EVER heard from $400 to even $1000 price range. The overall sound spectrum from highs to lows is just dumbfounding. The added features such as USB Power, built-in Amp, remote control, etc are all bonuses to this speaker. Audiophiles will not be disappointed, I highly recommend these with a USB DAC and UltraViolet USB cable.", "\"After months of research, I decided to go with Audioengine. The A2's looked like all I would need, but after reading the great reviews of the A5's, I chose the A5+ Bamboo. I ordered them on Friday late AM, and received them on Saturday morning (overnite FEDEX, $3.99). I've been breaking them in all day (not that I noticed a problem out of the box), as the mftr suggests. I'm feeding them the signal from a Fiio E-10 DAC, plugged into the USB on my iMac. They are mounted on a pair of dense foam blocks, to raise them slightly. I'm not sure I see the advantages of using the optional stands since they tilt the speaker back and change the plane of the tweeter and woofer. I had to re-arrange some items on my office shelves to prevent resonance during some of the lower bass passages.The packaging was stellar, with cables and speakers covered by some nice soft, cloth bags. The bags will come in handy to put over the speakers while I'm away, and help prevent dust settling on the speaker cones. Anyway, the setup is straightforward, and AE even provides some good speaker wire to connect the two units. They look fantastic. The manual says the sugar compounds in the bamboo are 'carbonized' and 'caramelized' to bring out the darker wood tones. It also provides a sweeter sound (ahem). Whatever. They look great, and seem to be finely finished. Worth the extra money for this option, I think.Okay, now for the sound. An audiophile of sorts, I have a history of buying the best-value components based on my readings of Stereophile, Absolute Sound, and high end audio blogs. My tunes are all Flac, Apple Lossless, or AIFF-C files. Of course, my iTunes purchases are 256Kb conversions...can't help that. I train my ears by going to many pop and classical concerts and listening for the qualities that make live music so enjoyable. So, I don't take my speakers lightly...I have some expectations. How do I rate the A5+'s? I couldn't be happier considering what I paid. The speakers never seem to strain, even at very high volumes. The only thing I notice is some compression of the midrange at VERY high volumes. The bass hangs in there, albeit cutoff below 50hz. I do miss that very bottom octave, however. Kettledrums just don't have that extra punch you expect. This is not a criticism; maybe it's just a reason to get a subwooofer. I rarely listen at very high levels since I'm usually working while listening. Female vocalists sound very natural, with no boxiness in the lower ranges. Sibilants sound very natural, and maybe a tad soft. Acoustic instruments have some body to them attesting to the good midrange. Imaging is excellent, and I find the placement is not super-critical. Equidistant spacing, lightly angled in seems to be just fine. (Note that AE suggests having at least 6\"\" of space behind the speakers, and they should be at least 6\"\" away from a side wall.) When I move, I don't notice shifting of frequencies, which means the dispersion of the tweeters seems to be very good. The soundstage is wide, very wide on some tunes. No problem with that. The sound is so darned neutral, that I can listen for hours and not get weary.As much as I enjoy listening to music through my IEM's (Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10 Pro's), it is really nice to be 'sitting in the audience' and listening to these speakers. With the lights down, they disappear, and you get that great experience of being there in the studio or concert hall. I'm sure there are better speakers out there that probably cost more, however I just can't fault the A5+'s. An audio bargain in my humble opinion.Update 10/30/2013I'm still loving these speakers. I missed the lower octave however, so I took a subwoofer I bought at Radio Shack several years ago, and plugged it in to the speakers. Now, I have a fuller experience of my music. I really love this system, and I have had no problems with it. No hum, pops, clicks, and the cases look as beautiful as the day I bought them.\"", "Background you can skipI realize that these have received many and consistently positive reviews all over the internet. And there is a reason for that: in its price range these are probably hard to beat. I thought, rather than adding more glowing reviews about the sound quality, I'd review my experience with setting these up in a Apple environment.Now before I get tons of hate mail about my Apple equipment: this is not supposed to be an Apple ad. It is merely meant for those that are looking to use some of the Airport/Airplay capabilities that come with iTunes, iPhone, AppleTV, iPod and iPad/2.Here is our setup in our home: most of my kids have iPods. My wife and I have iPhones. We also have iPads. We have a formal living room and a family/entertainment room with AppleTV and naturally we have iMacs on which we run iTunes. My iTunes library is sizable, at around 90GB since I digitized all CD's and and records I had over the years. We have this iTunes database on a Synology DS411+ from which we stream and it is shared in the home.In the family room I have an reasonably high quality stereo setup: Magnetostatic speakers and a amp/pre-amp (won't drop brand names) and CD player etc. Reasonably high end (better than my ears can detect anyways). I installed a Airport Express and used a 3.5mm to RCA cable to feed the AUX input et voila, I can select the Airport as an output location from iPod/iPad/iTunes etc.I could also use the AppleTV as an output location but that would require me to use the TV when I only wanted to stream music.This setup led me to think about getting music expanded to other rooms in my home. Many of the systems out there from Bose and Sony seemed to be very proprietary and completely overpriced for the sound quality they delivered, nor did they integrate very well.Looking for a multi-room setupThen, during a search for a better solution I ran into these in an audio store which happened to be willing to part with all their demo pairs at 50% off. After listening to them I decided these were right for me:- They had an Apple specific solution that only required me to BYOA, Bring Your Own Airport Express. Those Airports were the perfect solution for me: each pair could be selected in iTunes independently or I could select a whole series of them. An online article suggested you could not stream to multiple AE's at the same time unless you did a workaround (see article URL at bottom) but with the latest iTunes you can select several, all or one output. No work arounds needed.- They came in white, which I prefer in my home given the WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor) and Bamboo rather than the standard black only.- They were small enough as to not draw too much attention.Anyways, back to the Airport Express setup. It works well. The sound quality is fine and only limited by the quality of your audio files. It also plays in sync (no echo effect) when running multiple rooms at the same time. We, however, tend to use it in the rooms we are in at the time but have done a multi room party with it where people were asking where we got the awesome audio setup.Since the success with this we have expanded to the master bedroom and the kids rooms so that they can play their iPods without having to buy a whole stereo system.Not sure what else to say than that this is as easy as it can get for a multi room streaming solution and the sound quality is second to none.I have heard the Bose lifestyle solutions and mine blows it away with these little critters. I paid half but that the MSRP these are still very very worth it. And Apple sells the refurbed AE's for 69$ so you can't go wrong. Do make sure you do get the 8.11n Airports.Good luck if you decide to follow suit.URL I discussed above: [...]"], "A": [0.00016326751210726798, 0.1849060207605362, 3.263618195137319e-11, 1.4890602528794261e-08, 5.561984673421424e-16, 0.06309259682893753, 8.86661299936975e-11, 0.3684539794921875, 2.694171448436311e-11, 5.655969447471678e-19, 0.38338205218315125, 1.0672914108056375e-08, 1.1497404997463587e-14, 2.0442778350115987e-06, 1.5201313183846253e-18]}
