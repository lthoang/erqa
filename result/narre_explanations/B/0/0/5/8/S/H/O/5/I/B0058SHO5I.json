{"reviews": ["\"Clearly designed for the younger kids in your house, this game is a more kid-friendly version dance game for the Kinect. (less complex routines than Dance Central, etc.)  The upper age range I would recommend is 8 years-old.  The song list references \"\"Hot Pop Songs For Older Kids!\"\" but I suspect most older kids might politely disagree with the definition of \"\"hot.\"\"  (my thirteen year old loves dance games and wasn't too interested in this game).Many of the reviews note issues with the user interface, but we did not have any issues we haven't seen before with other Kinect games.  The Kinect controller is a great idea and largely works but it is often touchy and/or non-responsive.  The technology is still developing - it is not yet perfect for any game in my opinion.If you have younger kids who want a dance game for the Kinect, this game is a viable option.  I am amazed at the complexity of the routines present in other dance games and I think it is great to have a dance/Kinect option for younger kids as well.\"", "Chances are if you are looking for a dance game, you have seen the plethora of choices available to you. Every where you turn there seems to be a new dance game, then add to the fact that there are multiple sequels to dance games can make it even more confusing for some people. Which one is the best one is a matter of personal opinion.This game is geared towards kids (as evidence by the title of the game - I get points for stating the obvious there) :-). For the kid demographic it's a fun, engaging, and entertaining game. I don't see this game as a game that the kids will play for hours on end, but I see this game comfortably slipping into the rotation of games that get played often.There isn't anything, in my opinion, that makes it stick out above the others, but there's also nothing that makes me shun it either.", "As soon as your game's name mentions being for kids in the title, that's usually a red flag as far as quality's concerned. Most developers churn out a kid's game without having much of an understanding of what it takes to make a good kid's game. And for a 'grown up' system like the Xbox 360, it's rare to get one that isn't a platformer or movie-based game. It's even more rare when it turns out to be one that uses the Kinect, and is a music game of sorts. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of those games that I sighed at when it arrived in my mailbox, but shocked me at how much time UBI Soft put into making it a great package. But here's a quick warning for parents thinking about getting this title- this game is more for kids ages 4-7. Kids older than that will probably be ready for the regular dance games, but as usual, it depends on the person playing it. There are a lot of songs on here that anyone past the 2nd grade will probably roll their eyes at once they see them. That aside, if you have a young child, Just Dance Kids 2 is worth a shot.Just Dance Kids 2 has a fairly good selection of songs, and I was glad to see two tracks from Yo Gabba Gabba! and the infamous Gummy Bear song listed. Even the 'classics' are pretty good, though I don't know if any youngsters will know any of them in this day and age. Unless you're showing them Tiny Toon Adventures dvds or you're a big They Might Be Giants fan, there's not much of a chance that they'll know Istanbul. The game itself plays like your typical dance game, and grading is a little generous compared to something like say, Everybody Dance. If my old tubby self from the early 90s were to play this game now, I'd probably be getting above average scores and feeling like a Disco Stu[d].  Of all the features included with Just Dance Kids 2, the one that surprised me was the tracker that shows how long your child has been playing, which song they've played the most, and about how many calories have been burned. You know what else is cool? They even included a 'Pose & Shake' mode that has your child pretending to play instruments in the song. It might not seem like much, but the fact that they threw it in here is nice. Finally it has to be said that the kids dancing in the game are full of energy and look genuinely happy to be doing all of the dances. Even the little dude dressed up as Gru for the Despicable Me track looked into it, despite portraying a bad guy.There's not much negative to say about Just Dance Kids 2. It's a cheap game, so you won't feel like you've been ripped off, the gameplay is simple to get into, and it has a lot of great features. I just feel that the covers of the songs on here could've had a bit more energy in them (was it that hard to get the rights to the original songs?), and it would've been even better if the songs would've been played out in full rather than shortened versions. But with everything else the game gets right, I won't nitpick too much. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of the better games for young kids at the moment, and would be ideal for parties and holiday get-togethers.", "My kids, like so many other kids these days, are very electronics savvy. They and their friends love the Just Dance series for the Kinect. I was super excited to see this one and grabbed it, the songs are a little more kid-focused, etc.The BIG problem with this is that you cannot override the controls to use the controller and it sometimes messes up when you use the gestures. My kids and their friends were SUPER frustrated with that. They played for a little while (mostly at my prompting) but eventually moved on to other things. They've tried this a few other times, but they still tend to just use the Just Dance original series.Not a horrible game, just a huge oversight in design. Just because they are kids doesn't mean they don't know how to use the controller (heck, my kids have to turn the darn thing on for me!)", "My youngest boys are ages 5 & 7 and LOVE to dance. I really thought that they would enjoy this game but they didn't. We played once and unlike the rest of the Kinect games we own, they never wanted to play again.  I have no idea why the general disinterest as they already liked the bulk of the music used in the game.  I loved the game but I'm not exactly the target demograph.I'm unsure how to rate it.  I thought it was fun, the kids hated it.  I don't want to trash the entire game in the even my children are just oddballs on this opinion so I'm compromising with a 3-star rating.Update April 2012-I wrote this review in January.  Today I came home and my kids were playing this game and were having a blast.  I'm upgrading my review to 4-stars because it may be that I introduced it to them too close to Christmas.", "\"Just Dance Kids 2 is a Kinect-enabled game for your Xbox 360.  Kids play along by mimicing the actions of the dancers on the screen.There is a variety of songs for all age levels - both our 4- and 8-year-old managed to find some familiar favorites (while also discovering some new ones).  The biggest hits were the ones from their favorite TV shows (\"\"Yo Gabba Gabba\"\"), movies (\"\"Despicable Me\"\") and silly classics (\"\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\"\").The dance routines themselves also vary in complexity and even dynamically shift based on how the player is doing - mess up enough and it ratchets down the difficulty on-the-fly.  This is great for younger kids because they get to wiggle and jump around and yet still see a good score with lots of stars at the end.  This not only reduces their frustration but also levels the playing field when playing with older siblings.  By the time you get to the full-complexity routines, Just Dance Kids 2 delivers quite a workout as well - it's a great energy spend on a rainy day.  Note that some moves take up more space than other Kinect games that we've tried, so plan accordingly (or suffer stubbed toes!).The presentation is very kid-friendly, from the fun on-screen graphics to the kid dancers themselves.  Maybe I'm just getting old-fashioned, but there were a couple of instances where I found that the hip moves were approaching the line of suggestive - more conservative parents may want to watch along with their kids and monitor/restrict certain songs or else risk seeing their little one learning to bust a move that's better suited to the teen years.  The game does have a playlist feature that facilitates parental control of the songs.My only concern was the relative brevity of the whole playlist.  While our kids didn't seem to mind, it didn't seem to take long before we were all repeating the same tracks and routines.All in all, this is a great Kinect game for kids.  It keeps them active, helps build coordination and motor skills, and keeps them entertained.  We found that it also was favored by kids of all ages, so the replay and overall value is high as well.\"", "I have three Just Dance titles. This and the Just Dance Disney both get a lot of play time. All of my kids love dancing to these but the biggest difference between the two is that the Disney one can accommodate 4 players while Just Dance Kids 2 can only have up to 2 players. No clue why that is.Also, this one is more geared toward a younger crowd. All the songs are appropriate for the under 10 crowd even though it's fun for all ages. About half the Disney tracks are from Disney channel shows and those are more for tweens/teens.Overall, this is a fun game that I can play with my kids. The only frustrating part is that the kids cannot play by themselves since the kinect interface is too challenging for them.", "I used to have a Wii and my kids loved the Just Dance game for that system.  I was really excited to get and have them play this one fr the Xbox Kinect were you dont need a controller.  I have boys who are 4 and 6.  They really loved this game and its a great way to get them off the couch and moving. Love that their is a variety of songs for both older and younger kids and that they are recognizable songs.  A great game that is a nice way for the kids to exercise.  Would still recomend they go outside and play but for days were you cant this is a way to get them moving.", "My family has so many dance games but Just Dance Kids 2 really nailed it, accomplishing the task of meeting the needs of the younger kids rather than over-challenging them with the dance games made for older kids and adults. I also love that they introduced this game for all three major gaming system platforms. My kids have both the XBox 360 with Kinect and the Wii, but many of their friends just have one or the other so no matter which system they have they can buy it. My kids and their friends played this for hours and when I have younger visitors to the house they never turn down an opportunity to play this game.", "I acquired this for my daughter (9 years old) to use with our Kinect.  She loved it and still does..although after a while the novelty wears off and the games sits and eats dust.There are a few bugs, but after spending a little time with it and increasing your patience with the user interface; it is quite easy to manage...nothing that would make me hate the game.First things first - make sure your Xbox has all of the latest system updates installed - Ours was behind by one and that made things a bit more frustrating with this game.  Once we applied the update it was a bit better as Kinect was a bit more friendly.As with any game of this sort - remain informed - kids will like it and even love it when you first get it.  However, it will get stale once they have 'conquered' it and gone through all of the songs/levels/etc...overall 4/5 for us...", "\"This game is a bit hard for our 4 year old, but my husband and I had a blast playing with our 7 year old.  It took him a minute to get over his shyness, even though it was just family, but once he did he had a great time.  The songs on here are easily recognizable, a few of our favorites are \"\"Whip My hair,\"\" \"\"Shake Your Groove Thing,\"\" and \"\"Burnin Up.\"\"I am not well versed on all the mechanics to the Kinect, but once you put the game in it is very user friendly.  Since this is a dancing game for younger kids, I liked  that the moves are slower and repetitive, but not so boring that we didn't enjoy playing with the boys.  I can even see our older kids (17, 16 and 12) playing around with their little brothers for a laugh.Once you pick a song, there are three dancers on your TV (all these kids can dance, and they look like they are having fun without being goofy OR cheesy), and you are told to follow the middle dancer.  (We have a Nickelodean Just Dance game as well, and you follow the same instructions, so I am assuming that is the case for all \"\"just Dance\"\" games.)  I would guesstimate that you do each move four or five times, so that even the younger kids can take a moment to get the hang of a certain move.Another thing I liked is the song selection.  My younger son enjoys listening to nursery rhymes and they had a number of those on here, while my 7 year old likes pop music, again a number of those choices as well.I think this game is easily worth the money.  It got my kids up and moving and we all had a good laugh.  Great family game!\""], "A": [0.000606129877269268, 0.41250136494636536, 1.6154622244357597e-06, 0.00018003775039687753, 0.0012104091001674533, 0.18989960849285126, 0.14203479886054993, 0.011483822949230671, 0.2269897162914276, 0.0012064877664670348, 0.013886054046452045]}
