{"reviews": ["\"Dance games sure have come a long way since shaking your groove thing to David Bowie in Dance Dance Revolution. As opposed to slipping and sliding on plastic dance mats, today's next gen consoles take full advantage of 21st century controllers like the PS3 Eye and Move controller.  But down to the game at hand. JDK2 is easy to use and the kids seem to like it. You will need some room to move around, especially if you plan to have more than one player dancing at a time. On that topic, these sorts of games are great ways to sneak some exercise in on your kids while they play on their favorite gaming console.If I have any criticism on JDK2, is that it tries to be all things to all \"\"kids\"\". Any collection that includes Itsy Bitsy Spider and Burnin Up is going to raise an eyebrow or two. In the same breath, they have classics that mom and dad can enjoy with their kids - songs like Lollipop and Crocodile Rock. In the end, I'm not sure if all 40+ songs will be fun to everyone in your crowd, but it should get the kids up and moving and having a fun time doing it.\"", "\"Wow, the sound is completely broken in this game. The menu music and sounds are fine, but when you play a song the music is very quite and only comes from the front left speaker. All sounds effects for scoring are 5.1 and loud, it is just the song that you dance to that is screwed up. Did Ubi try playing their game before shipping it? Speaking of Ubi, this game does not have an area in their forums and the \"\"official\"\" web page is facebook, WTF? Back to Amazon as defective if I do not find a fix ASAP.\"", "While I've seen other reviews give problems with technical difficulties on this game, we never experienced any. It's definitely a kid's game, as the songs get annoying very quickly to most adults. You'll probably put this one in and leave the room for a while rather than watch the kids play. There aren't that many songs here, but I guess the fun for the kids comes in knowing the songs.", "My family has always loved dance games but this is the first dance game for kids we got for the PS3. The user interface is very confusing. At first I left the game to my kids but they couldn't figure out how to pick the songs, so they got frustrated and came to me. It took me a while to figure out. Picking a song or making a playlist is a royal pain.The songs themselves are okay, some more familiar than others. The songs are accompanied by real human kids doing the moves but the on-screen kids are pretty homely and therefore not too inspiring to my kids or their friends. Finally, the novelty factor wore off quickly and they soon went back to their DS and Wii games.", "\"I got this for our family game night and it was a lot of fun.  This game will be remain a staple in our weekly video game night until we can progress to more complicated dance games.  I have two boys (8 & 10) and wanted to find something that would be fun without having to worry about the song selection.  You'd be surprised at some of the songs included for kids games.  All 40 songs were kid friendly and ranged from pre-school to pop songs and I would rate the age range from 3-8 but it also works for families.Please note that you must have a PS3 Move controller to be able to play this game.  The moves are simple and can progress but are never difficult.  I would recommend this to beginners only.  We've tried \"\"Just Dance\"\" and \"\"Dance Revolution\"\" for wii but that was a bit tricky for our youngest so we went with this game and are happy with the choice.  It is easy to set up and my kids figured it out without guidance.  You can play one song at a time, string them together or use the shuffle function.  A filter for age range is provided and you can make up playlists for up to 10 songs.  My only complaint is that I wish additional songs could be downloaded instead of having to buy additional discs but this is minor so I didn't deduct any points.I am very happy with this game and highly recommend it to families with young children.  It is easy to do and lots of fun to play (even those sitting on the couch will have fun watching).\"", "\"I have two \"\"kids\"\", at 10 and 13 years old.  I let them play with this, and here's their review.  This is a very good game for kids.  It has many songs from a variety of shows and artists.  However, it does not appeal to anyone above the ages of 6-7 because it is a KIDS game. Being 13 years of age, I found the game very, very unsatisfactory, but I could see my younger cousins loving it.  The same went for my sister, at 10 years old, it was still not challenging to me.Overall, a nice game, from a parent's point of view.  Nice songs, nothing harmful, and the moves aren't suggestive or anything.\"", "\"Just Dance Kids 2 for PS3 is fun for younger kids, and their older siblings as well. My kids are 7 and 11 and they both enjoyed playing this with each other, with myself also hopping in at times to get my butt kicked with my terrible dance moves. They enjoyed a good portion of the songs which are included, although they had never heard a few of them before.Overall, the game provides a good break with some silly fun and great exercise for the whole family. I don't think it's quite as involving as the regular Just Dance titles without the \"\"Kids\"\" label, but that's what makes it easier and perhaps funner for the younger ones to play. I think the recommended age range of 3-8 years old is about right for this game, but older kids can still enjoy it as well.\"", "I have only dabbled with DDR in the past and don't really do dancing games much so for me the 1:1 move control is underutilized in a game like this.  Holding the controller to mimic arm movements can be fun but you really have to throw yourself into the dancing part (feet aren't recognized) to have any fun and fortunately kids are good at doing just that.  My 3 yr old has a great time holding the controller she tends to watch the feet of the dancers instead of the hand movements, when I remind her to move her arms however she does great and many of the moves are swooping and whooshing arm types which she really gets into.  Many of the songs are chosen exactly for younger gamers (itsy spider/hokey pokey) and are good clean family fun.  She has hit the PShome button on accident a couple times during gameplay but has also gotten quite adept at getting her controller set on the player selection screen.  There are avatars for gamers but no profiles which makes jump in multi play really easy.  The menu control which has you holding the trigger button to move the cursor takes some getting used to, and the options are hidden under menu choice for PARENTS.  The songs themselves are almost all cover versions some better than others and the 10 yr old has found many to dance to and is good about using the Team Score mode to let the littler one feel a sense of accomplishment.  They do fight over song choice but they have learned to do one song for each of them.  I am going to get another version of this for the Wii so I can get my Move controllers back, the kids have discovered that the songs are more fun when you start to memorize the dance moves.  The camera option doesn't work in the room I have my PS3 set up in as it is to dark but that is a problem with every game that uses the EYE to take pictures for me.  4 stars when the kids opinions are factored in.", "This game is good, but the selection of songs for younger children is better in the first game (Just Dance Kids). Still fun, though, and I'm sure my kids will get a lot of use out of it.", "\"Just Dance Kids 2 for the Playstation 3 is a great dance game for children and pre-teens. With over 40 different songs, sung in 4 different languages (English, Spanish, French & German). These songs are organized by different age groups. The \"\"younger\"\" age group which is aimed at preschool-kindergarten age includes songs like Are you Sleeping, The Hokey Pokey, and The Wiggle Song from Yo Gabba Gabba. The Older group, has a range of songs that even your 11-12 year old would enjoy, such as \"\"Whip my hair\"\", \"\"Just the way you are\"\" \"\"Rocketeer\"\" and more. Most songs with the exception of the ones sung by the Wiggles, or Yo Gabba Gabba, are done by cover groups.The Game itself features up to four players so the whole family can join in and dance together. The dance's themselves are creative, energetic and easy to follow along so everyone can enjoy. One of my favorite features is the Shuffle playlist which can be set anywhere from 10-60 minutes, so you never have to stop and select a song. It also utilizes the Playstation Move's Camera and takes pictures while you dance which you can save and share with friends.This is a great way to get your little one up and moving, and having fun while they're doing it. Just don't expect to get your Playstation 3 back once you get them started : ).\""], "A": [0.004571693483740091, 0.063005730509758, 0.11981362849473953, 0.10206004977226257, 0.19412237405776978, 0.04187902808189392, 0.003020666306838393, 0.006112727336585522, 0.4288492202758789, 0.03656485676765442]}
