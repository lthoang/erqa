{"reviews": ["\"There are other excellent reviews of this projector's ability to function in a business setting. However, its decent 1280x800 resolution (approx 720p) and its HDMI input allow it to support movie projection. In this review, I'll focus on whether it can anchor a home theater system.[I'm using it to project a 135\"\" diagonal, with a throw distance of about 16 feet, mounted on the ceiling, in a completely light controlled room.]The EX7210 actually turned out to be a very capable performer in terms of its brightness, color reproduction, and sharpness.However, where it's price point becomes apparent is in its inability to achieve decent blacks. The best I could manage were grays. Also, its fan is loud, and kicks in early. (The fan can be turned off in ECO mode, but that sacrifices brightness.)This results in a movie experience that is definitely enjoyable, but not completely immersive.Overall, this is a very thoughtfully designed unit. Its menu layout is logical, it provides a wealth of control options, and its competent remote can not only control every function, but also can work from every conceivable angle - great for use in the dark.This is definitely a 5-star business projector due to interesting features such as the ability to store a logo, to drive slide shows from a USB drive, and to use the remote control as a mouse. However, its home theater performance is closer to 3-star territory. I've averaged these scores to rate it at 4 stars.Happy movie watching!\"", "I bought this for my astronomy club that uses it for presentations to public, schools, scouts. I had previous experience with a couple of older models. This one really is dramatically improved in several ways. Ability to use with HDMI of course as well as USB and SVGA connections. While previous projectors also had keystone corrections, this version adds an additional feature that lets you tilt the image side to side which is a neat feature. The remote has a few tricks of its own...the best is you can turn on a pointer on the screen to point out things. You can leave your red dot pointer home. It is 2800 lumens and plenty bright and does not need a long cool off period before completely shutting down. The 3CCD is one of the factors that give much better color perfomance and the lens is sharper than I remember on older projectors. The USB ability to use flash drives, etc. may not be completely useable for your purposes  as it only works with some image types and not Power Point. This last is expected as you really need to use a tablet or laptop with PP or its free reader.  I wasn't expecting this to have a speaker but it does although of course not going to fill a large room. It is OK for very small groups.It comes with a nylon case for the projector and a small amount of room is provided in the case for some cords but it is on the small side...would have likd  a bit larger case to hold more of the cables but his isn't a big deal. We take good care of our equipment but it might be worthwhile getting a heavier duty hard case for transportation if you are a &#34;road warrior&#34; type of user. I recommend Pelican brand cases.Bottom line for a computer projector is the image quality. We need very high image quality to show our astronomical images at there best...this one does it. It is HD at 740p which is sufficient for our purposes. At this point no one makes a 1080p HD projector at this price and quality point. I figure that will be the model upgrade down the road but hopefully it will keep the form factor of this model and not the bloated home theater projectors that cost a LOT more money.", "I am not going to go down the list of specs, just the pros/highlights.  I have no cons as of yet.  I am by no means a projector professional wizard, I just know my electronics and need a well rounded, light-weight project with HD (720P) and for my money, this one was perfect.Setup - 1 is for business travel for sales meeting.  Other is for in the lobby of our business we project ESPN up on a 25 foot wall that is curved in a full circle.&#8226;Image is bright, crisp and clear.&#8226;HDMI & USB connection is great.  HDMI is best solution when connecting.  For lobby projector that is 75 ft away from sat set-top box, we connected via HDMI with Actiontec My Wireless TV WiFi / HDMI Multi-Room Wireless HD Video Kit.  The combo is amazing.&#8226;I love the speaker on it, we needed that for the lobby so we didn't have set up separate speakers from the sat set-top box.&#8226;The video mute (manual slide that will cover the lens is great during the meeting when you just need to get the image of the screen immediately have something cued up for the start of the meeting.&#8226;Bring in the corners and pan/tilt is easy and fast for corrections on this projector.&#8226;No cool time necessary, start up is fast.  Operation is near silent and doesn't have over-whelming heat from it.&#8226;Comes with a carrying case, could use a little more padding, but not reason to take away a star or not buy it.  Its pretty decent.All in all, very very satisfied with this unit.  Time will tell if it will last the test of time.  We have had both for well over a month with steady use on the one we use for meetings and daily use for the projector in the lobby.", "Well, maybe it's not the very best (some permanently installed at my university might beat it), but it's definitely the best portable projector I've used. I've seen smaller, but it's plenty compact, lightweight, and portable, while still being really bright, having plenty of interface options, high resolution, and some pretty nifty features built in. I especially like the distortion corrections for viewing angle if you're not able to set the thing up perfectly at 90 degrees from your projection surface (vertical corrections are automatic, and you can also correct horizontals using a slider if needed).I haven't worked my way through the menu settings yet, so I don't know all the features, but I haven't had any problems getting it to work with my laptop, using either either my laptop's HDMI out or the VGA connection (or even USB, but see below).I've used it for classroom presentations, as well as hooking it up to the home theater system and using it for a big-screen effect (which also works well). I like the widescreen format (similar to my laptop, so not as much gets compressed upon resizing). I also like the high resolution, which means the display looks really good (and again, it doesn't have to resize as much, since it's closer in resolution to my laptop than other projectors I've used).Comes with everything needed: carrying case (decent, but could have been made better), plus cables: VGA and A-to-B-type USB cable, plus power cable. No HDMI cable included though (went to monoprice for that, awesome).Oh, the USB connection. Yes, you can hook your laptop to the projector via the included USB cable. No, it's not as good. I'm guessing that data rates must be low, so don't expect to be playing any high resolution video via that cable. It was really choppy. Use VGA or HDMI for that instead. For static powerpoint presentations, USB might be fine since it's not dependent on high data rates. Still, it's not an option with other projectors, and could come in handy (one less cable, a backup option, etc).I still haven't tried using the projector to play presentations directly from a plugged-in USB drive. Honestly, don't know how that can work (does it have powerpoint built in?), but I'll try it soon and hopefully remember to update this review.Anyway, it's awesome. I hope the bulb lasts as long as it claims, since it's not gonna be cheap to replace, and I love this thing.", "\"Epson has gone the full 9 with this projector.  It's compact, comes with most of the cables a majority of users will need, and even a nifty carrying case to fit everything into.  I think the part that impressed me the most was the exclusive tech support phone number right on the bottom of the projector itself.  Clearly, Epson is aiming for the business class and intend to stand behind their product.Easy SetupI recently got an Epson printer and had nothing but trouble with the software setup right from the get-go -- a tell-tale sign of a piece of junk in my book.  Well, it looks like they got their act together this time around, by contrast, the setup for this projector was as uneventful as it should be -- no issues whatsoever installing the software on Win 7 Pro 64bit; just a clean seamless install and use.  Silly as it sounds, that's often not the case.  Truth be told, there's little to no setup if you're doing slideshow presentations off a USB flash drive; everything can be done on the projected screen right out of the box.  The same holds true of your laptop has an HDMI port -- just plug in the cable from laptop to projector and operate your computer as normal.  But here's the real kicker...Android Tablet projection via Toshiba ThriveToshiba Thriveis the only tablet, Android or Apple, to offer a full-sized HDMI port -- I just plugged in an HDMI cable (not included) from my tablet to this projector, and voila, my Android tab is being projected onto any surface I want.  Now that's forward thinking technology in my book.  Tired of all work and no play?  How about playing Angry Birds projected on a huge screen?  Or maybe you're an app developer wanting to show your latest creation to a room of clients.  The possibilities are endless, that is, if you have a Thrive with full-sized HDMI ports.Speaking of InputsThis projector has every port I'd ever want -- USB, HDMI, S-Vid, RCA -- even the arcane VGI port if anyone still has the need (eek!  I guess the only thing missing as an SD slot, which might have been good for certain slideshow presentations.  But with all the other connectivity options, the oversight is no big deal. After all, at the end of the day, it's all just multiple options of doing the same thing.Image Quality & BrightnessThe quality of the projected image is superb -- naturally some environmental factors come into play, such as, the surface being projected on, and lighting environment.  But I was able to get clean, crisp images, even in a room with the lights on!  I'm quite happy with how everything looked.  And yes, even text was crisp and perfectly legible. And it doesn't take much tweaking with the focus and projection angles to find the best settings.  Perfect!QuietThe unit itself is fairly quiet.  It does have internal fans to dissipate heat, but the sound wasn't distracting or loud by any means.  Over time, as the fan blades collect dust, that may change.  But most times I can quiet down a noisy fan by just blasting it with a shot of compressed air.It Gets HotThe projector does get hot quite fast and blows warm air from its vents almost immediately.  It's not scalding hot or anything.  And the manual does say you don't have to wait for it to cool off before packing it away.  But it's just worth mentioning that it heats up fast.Boot UpThis projector boots up and is ready to go in less than 30 seconds.  So if you're running late and everyone is waiting for you to get going, this Epson won't hold you back at all.RemotePretty much everything this projector does can be controlled with the wireless remote, including switching input sources, e-zoom, volume, etc; offering all the flexibility and control I'd want or need.  And I don't even have to point the remote directly at the projector to make it work; in fact, I intentionally pointed the remote away form the projector at extreme angles and the IR signals reached the projector with no trouble at all.SoundThe built in speaker is surprisingly loud.  It's not HiFi stereo or anything, but people shouldn't have any trouble hearing audio during a presentation.Light & CompactThis projector isn't overly bulky or heavy, which is great, because I'm disabled and don't need to lug bulky, heavy peripherals around.  I have some applications for this in mind which will all occur on the road, so this lightweight projector is a plus for me. It's about the size of one of those big 4\"\" 3-ring binders, only nowhere near as heavy as those get if loaded to the max with paper.  Another nice touch is the carrying bag is marked on the inside, reminding me to put the projector inside with the lens facing up (if it were facing down and the bag was accidentally dropped or set down too hard, the lens could shatter.)Bottom Line -- this is a pretty straight forward projector -- everything works as I expected and was easy to operate.  I really didn't need to refer to the instructions for much of anything.  This is a great projector, and compared to how expensive these used to be, the price is good for the quality.  I don't recall the brand I used to use in the past, but I remember it was 3x the cost of this Epson, and didn't have all the features.  But then, rapidly changing tech is just a sign of the times.  If you don't need HDMI, Epson even offers a cheaper model than this one; just figure out what inputs you need most, cuz there's no need to break the bank buying features you'll never use.  Though IMO, the HDMI is the most indispensable and the port I'll use most.  I may even project video off my HD video camera!  Kudos!\"", "We purchased this product for one of our conference rooms.  I have purchased a different model Epson for a smaller conference room and was happy with it so i went with Epson again.  We have it mounted upside down at the ceiling and we are displaying it on a 106&#34; Da-Lite screen and it looks really good.  I am very happy with the product.", "I got this so that I would never have to depend on someone elses equipment, after an evening of malfunctions.  It is nice to have a reliable, bright, easily adjustable means of displaying media.", "\"When looking for a multimedia projector, you have a few choices -- this is definitely one of the better ones, and it's priced reasonably. My main experience is with multiple Optoma HD20 projectors in my office (which cost a few hundred dollars more but support a higher resolution.) Epson has put a lot of thought into the everyday use and have created features that make this my preferred model over the Optoma, despite the resolution difference.All the standard ports are there -- HDMI, USB (for PC/Mac connection, and storage device), VGA, Composite, and S-Video. DVI and component are available with the necessary converters. Power, USB, and VGA cables are included -- the rest you'll have to provide on your own. HDMI is my primary connector (for both my MacBook Pro and iPad, with appropriate Apple adapters) but am disappointed that the sound in the projector is subpar (and probably monaural), but no real surprise there. Buying a projector with only VGA is a terrible investment -- while still standard today, the manufacturers have indicated that VGA (analog) ports will be less common in just a few years. Best to output your sound to another speaker system -- you can't output the sound from the projector to another source directly, so you'll have to do it from its origination point.The projector more or less provides 720p resolution, for those who prefer that jargon. The Optoma I referenced in comparison is a 1080p projector, but unless you need really detailed text resolution or are an A/V purist who wants the best Blu-ray has to offer, it's generally not worth the extra cost. The resolution provided here is sufficient for the vast majority of personal and business uses.USB options: I didn't try outputting an image from a computer directly to the projector this way; due to USB speed limitations, the image would definitely be subpar -- and it requires another (useless) application to be installed. Plugging in a USB mass storage device (e.g. digital camera, USB thumb drive) provides for direct access with the processing power in the projector for certain file formats (images, mostly.)Useful functions: There is no lens cap to lose -- it's an integrated slider (that also mutes audio, if applicable, when closed.) There is a keystone adjustment right by the lens -- a great slider that gets the image straight on the wall, no matter your projector's angled position. This is normally the main reason to fumble through a projector's OSD menus, and this feature gives you one less reason to do so. Once the projector is off (yes, it's still hot) you can unplug immediately -- no waiting two minutes for the fan to cool it down. Might want to wait a bit still to put it back in the included (cheap, but serviceable) carrying case, but at least you can work on cleaning up the wiring while you wait. The included remote control, which I haven't needed much, but also lets you control your computer's mouse cursor, works well no matter where the projector is, since there are infrared sensors on BOTH sides of the projector. These \"\"special features\"\" really do make this Epson unique.The bulb: The projector boots up relatively quickly to full brightness, perhaps in about 30 seconds. I've turned on ECO mode, which is supposed to eek up to 1,000 extra hours to the bulb (5,000 vs. standard 4,000) -- with my use of a few hours a week, I'm hoping the bulb will last me a while. The replacement bulb is a couple hundred dollars -- not bad, not great, but par for the course with LCD projectors. I haven't done any scientific brightness studies, but the image seems totally readable even in a moderately sunny living room with windows all open. Of course blacks (and colors) in general look better in a darker room, but it's totally passable. All my tests were on a semi-glossy wall, not even on a dedicated projector screen.All the standard mounting options are available, if you're looking for a (semi)-permanent installation somewhere like a ceiling, rear screen mount, etc. -- the projector will happily adjust the image as necessary with just a few selections in the menus.Bottom line: If you need 1080p, look elsewhere, but for most uses, this ~720p projector will suffice for you -- whether it is watching the latest Transformers movie (which I did and looked great), viewing photos, or a \"\"bland\"\" PowerPoint presentation. The price seems about right for the feature set, and definitely less than these cost just a few years ago.\"", "\"Just recently, very few people can afford a projector for home use.  Now that they are everywhere, even high definition projectors are cheaper than LED or even LCD HDTVs.  What is great about projectors?  You get a giant screen that you can practically place anywhere as long as you have a wall.Epson is a well known brand when it comes to projectors.  The EX7210 has a WXGA resolution which is 720 x 1280, hmmm... not 1080P, but close.  My intent is to use it as a portable home mini theater having just the perfect size walls (in our master bedroom, living room and basement) to project widescreen images at 120 inches or more.WHITE BLANKET:We tried using a white blanket.  The problem with a regular blanket is that you can easily see the creases unless it is completely flat.  This is more visible if you are projecting in an angle.  Not that it will not work, but if you are not planning to spend a fortune for dedicated screens, a white blanket will do.The best choice is a wall big enough to project the image.  Our wall is not completely white but a bit of a beige; still, the colors are rich and you can see the vibrant colors of red, green, or blue.  Our master bedroom on the other hand is light mocha, but we really cannot tell the difference.  Anyway, there are special paints available that are specially made for projection.  Just make sure you don't have objects on your walls like picture frame nails or holes as they can be annoying when you are watching.2800 lumens is sufficiently bright, the images can be clearly seen even on daytime, as long as you don't have pretty strong lights coming from the windows.EXTENDING LAMP LIFE TO 5000 HRS:For home use, one of the first things I did was to change the setup of the projector to ECO mode.  This extends the life of the lamp to 5000 hours.  The lamp currently sells at Amazon for about 160$.  You will need the remote for that - go to Settings/Power Consumption/ECO.CONVENIENT CONTROLS:Keystone, zoom and focus ring are all very accessible, they are located just right on top of the projector lens. The permanent lens cover slides to protect the glass so there is no cap to lose.  Keystone adjusts the image for a perfect rectangle if you cannot position the projector exactly in the middle of the room.  If you are still not satisfied, you can adjust each corner individually using the remote.UP AND DOWN TILT:Push the front button and a mini stand will fall and lock into position at the height you choose when you release the button.\"\"SOURCE\"\" BUTTON:If you have multiple sources and cables attached to the projector, a push of this button will automatically cycle to different video inputs and stop where there is a video signal, whether from a DVD player, a setup box, a camera, or a laptop.2 INFRARED RECEIVERS:Whether the projector is in front or on your back, the remote control will not have any problem sensing it.  It has infrared sensors on the front and at the back.***NOW THE ROKU:For my purpose, my biggest question is if it will work with the Roku.  Roku is as small as a hockey puck.  Add that to the EX7210, and you have a super portable entertainment set combination.  It took me a few days to get the right answer.  I thought it was funny that both Epson and Roku customer service doesn't have a ready answer.  I chatted first with a Roku rep and asked if it will work with my projector using HDMI and the analog A/V output to an external powered speaker.ROKU chat Rep:  \"\"It will not run because of HDCP issue\"\".Email response from Epson:  \"\"This should work with the Roku. The projector is HDCP compliant.\"\"Email from Roku:  \"\"Normally we recommend the customers to connect the Roku player directly to the TV. We never tested Roku with the projector. However you can try connecting the video via the HDMI to the projector and the audio via the A/V analog to a pair of powered speakers. You may get the output.\"\"- Was a bit surprised there that they have not tried their product on a projector and wasn't sure if the external speakers will work.--------------Cons:The main reason why I have to contact Epson and Roku is that the projector doesn't have an audio output (something more common with HDTVs via an optical output).  You'll have to get the audio from your content source device, which in this case is the Roku.And so, I bought a Roku.  Since the projector is not 1080P, I just chose the LT which is the cheapest but still capable of displaying HD contents via Wifi.  I hooked them up together and so happy that it worked.  Amazon Video on Demand HD and Netflix HD contents are gorgeous.I also hooked up the projector using my PC computer, my WD TV player and directly to a Flip camera.  They all worked.Finally, although it lacks a little bit of padding, it is nice that they have included a carrying bag.\"", "Bought this for my church and am pleased. It handles all formats and runs online. Online menu is similar to Sony's and offers a good variety of services. Nice left/right keystone adjustment on top. Window/lens shutter is very useful as it shuts the projector light off, too. Not noisy. Not hot running. We are using it to show classic movies, regular DVD format films and Blu-ray. All look good.", "\"Seeing this device and thinking of the possibilities of life-size, if not bigger, characters from video games moving around on the wall or on a projector screen had me drooling pretty quickly.  I could spend a ton of moulah (that I'd rather not have to spend) to get a big TV or I could get this little device and have a TV of pretty much any size I wanted provided I have an appropriate wall space or other area to view the output at.  What's not to like?Ok, ok, it's really NOT going to be used for video games for me (sorry to disappoint everyone).  It could do that, but really this is also a serious device for serious business users.  People that will want to show Power Point presentations and slide shows and such can be assured that this device will cover their needs very well.  It just so happens that it could also be used with a modern gaming console or Blu-ray player to show movies or play video games and could just as easily be hooked up to a cable/satellite set-top-box to project TV content.  Versatility (which I talk about more in just a bit).When I got the package from Amazon I'd have to say that I was a little concerned that something must be missing and everything wasn't in the box.  Thankfully my worries were quickly erased as I learned just how nice and light weight this projector is.  It's not feather light, but it's not at all heavy.  I added (assuming it comes through with the review) the additional attribute of \"\"Weight\"\" for the review just so I could give this device 5 stars in that individual category as it really deserves it.  I've had to lug an older and much heavier projector around the office at times and hated having to do so, but we have a tendency to use equipment until it really can't be used anymore there as we live frugally and stretch the budget to accomodate needs over wants.  Anyway, I know that times have changed as we have gotten very similar projectors to this one for use in the work place and have enjoyed using them as compared to their older category cousins and siblings.I also added the Versatility and Usability individual attributes because this is a very versatile and usable device.  The various ports that are offered mean not having to wish for a connection type/port that just isn't there.  While there will surely be some potential buyers that are looking for something different, for most people's needs this device should have you well covered.The solitary complaint I might have with this device is in the area of heat production.  The lamp gets very warm.  Not at all unexpected and not dangerously so, but still something to consider if you intend to use the device for a while.  In my home, if I wanted to use this device in my bedroom, where I have an olderApple TV MB189LL/A with 160GB Hard Drivedevice that is in and of itself a space heater, I could see myself wanting to crank up the air conditioner just in an effort to cool things down.  Admittedly the air flow and heating/cooling concerns of my home probably don't match those of others here, but the point would be that this device does generate heat and a user should factor in the need to provide adequate cooling and air flow.  You'd also need to allow for cool-down periods so the lamp can cool off before storing the unit in the included carrying bag.Having the bag in the box was also a nice treat since it meant not having to hunt around for a bag to go with the device.This one definitely rates an enthusiastic BUY IT rating from me.\"", "This is a great projector.  It is extremely easy to use.  The price is fairly low and it has all of the features that I need.", "I am a teacher and am using two versions of this projector currently in my classrooms, the EX7210 and the EX3210.  This review includes both general information about the two projectors and describes the differences between them.General review of the Epson Multimedia Projector: Applicable to both modelsThe projector itself is smaller than I expected. It is also reasonably light and comes with a carry case for easy transport. As teacher who moves from room to room the portability is handy.  The carry case has a strap long enough to throw it over your shoulder, a real plus when you are juggling stuff between classrooms.  The case has a front pocket for the power cord and remote as well.  The manual and CD (for extra info) are originally packed inside this front pocket of the case.Inputs:The projector is absolutely idiot proof when it comes to inputs.  You can push the button that says Source Search and it will find where you are trying to input and start displaying the information.Light output:Light output is strong enough that Powerpoint presentations can be seen with the projector 20 feet away from the screen (this is as far back as I can get it in the room  in partially lit room.  Partially lit in this case is defined as the overhead lights are off but the three windows do not have blinds.  The room is bright enough that the students can easily see their papers and take notes (and I can see the students!).  These projectors put out 2800 lumens (a lumen is a unit of visible light emitted by a source).  The school has 1500 lumen projectors, which I rarely used because the lights had to be all the way off for the student to see the projections, and that leads to trouble.Sound output:It has built in speakers and they are loud enough for use in a room with 50 students but just barely. In the smaller room with 25 kids it is great.  If you use it with a laptop I would suggest adding some speakers for sound.Noise and Heat:They hum.  The fan whirs.  Not very loud but it is audible.  They get hot, and fast.  This is one problem because you need to let them sit for a few minutes after using so the fan can cool the bulb down before you unplug it.  That means I have to remember to turn them off a few minutes before class ends.  If you are leaving it in one place this is not a problem.  If you have to run, it might be.Differences:Want to watch movies?  You want the EX7210 with the HDMI input.I see two main difference between the EX7210 and the EX3210 (besides the color) .  The first is the inputs.  The EX7210 has HDMI inputs and a higher resolution (1280 X 800 for the EX7210 and 800 X 600 for the E3210).  The difference is clearly visible.  If you are using the projector for video (or showing movies) the EX7210  definitely provides a clearer picture.  Projected on a screen from 10 feet away movies are clear, sharp and very little pixilation is visible.Just want to use it for presentations?If you are using the projector for business presentations (Powerpoint and such) the lower end EX3210 is plenty good enough.  I have often been using it to project a grid onto the classroom chalkboard for graphing.  I can then switch to the next image with the answer and the student can see if their solution was correct.  This is a godsend, as it is difficult to graph on a chalkboard with any accuracy without a grid.  The projector even has a setting for the chalkboard, which takes into account its greenish grey color and counteracts the color change.  It is bright enough to project a clear grid.  The only small problem is keeping out of the way so you don't block the image.And other usesThe projector can also be used in science class to project a clear slide of one color of light to show color absorption and reflection.  I know this is not what it was designed for at all, but it works very well for this purpose.  I simply made an image of the various colors I want to compare and since the projector uses LCD to make the light the wavelengths are very precise.  Although this will probably not be useful for most users it does show you how clear a projection the device yields.Other issues:I originally tried to use the projectors with really cheap (think less than a cup of high end coffee) 25 foot long HDMI cables.  This caused some problems, with the signal dropping out every once in a while. Digital is either all there, or not.  With a slightly better (think two fast food dinners) 25 foot cable I did not have this problem.The replacement lamp is currently just over 160 dollars on Amazon.  Since it is rated for 4,000 hours that is a lot of science and math.I cannot speak to the price/value for these projectors (as I only have these and the school ones  but they are a LOT better than the school provided ones.  Everybody wants to borrow them, and since they are easy to move around it is simple to loan them out.", "\"This projector was purchased for use by our service club to make presentations at our weekly meetings.  I spent some time with it going through the menus and getting familiar with it so that I can provide \"\"tech support\"\" to various presenters who may or may not be club members.  The first thing that I noticed is that this projector has no trouble identifying and connecting to the video source, whether it be HDMI, VGA, or USB.  (How many times have you been to a presentation that started with, \"\"Well it was working a little while ago!\"\" while everyone sits and looks at a screen that says \"\"searching ... searching ...\"\".)  In addition, it is possible to connect multiple video sources and easily switch among them with the remote.  Speaking of the remote, you can aim it at the front of the projector, the back, or bounce the signal off the screen.  Speaking of the screen, this projector supports normal, inverted (for ceiling mount), reverse (for rear projection) and reverse inverted modes.  I like the fact that it can do a slide show directly from a USB thumb drive, although be advised that the only file format supported for that function is JPG.  That's not a severe limitation, however, since PowerPoint can export an entire presentation as a series of JPG images.  One issue that you must be aware of is that the projector reads files exactly like any other (dumb) computer.  So, if you number your image files, it will read them in the following order: 1, 10, 100, 101, 102, ... 2, 20, 200 ....  The fix for this is to use a scheme such as 001, 002 ... 010, 011, ... 100, etc.  No big deal, just confusing at first.Overall we are very pleased with this projector.  It has good brightness and good color.
