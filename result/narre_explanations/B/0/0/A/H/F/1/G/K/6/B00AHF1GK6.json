{"reviews": ["It's hard to beat 3 razors for $10 especially when they work as well as the Schick Hydro 5. It delivers a really nice close shave and it was extremely easy to maneuver around knees and ankles without any nicks.  Obviously this is intended for a man, but it worked amazingly well on my legs.  Fellas, if you buy this, expect your wife to steal it.", "I've used an electric shaver exclusivley for years now but was never very happy with the smoothness of my legs from it.  There seemed to be a bit of stubble that the electric couldn't get at.  This solves that problem and the moisturization this gives as I shave eliminates the fear of razor burn and scraping that I had experienced from a blade.  My legs are left soft and smooth and there is no greasy feel as I thought there might be.  Best of all, the shave is so close there isn't the slightest hint of stubble and the shave lasts over a week longer than it did with the electric.  I may give up the electric shave for good and switch over to this permanently.", "My teen daughter gave me rave reviews for the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor. And she is picky, believe me! She said it worked very well and the skin was smooth afterwards!", "I have been using Schick Intuition razors for a couple of years and really like them.  I now have a new favorite!  This Schick Hydro 5 is a great razor.  It gives a clean smooth shave, and leaves my skin feeling soft.  The curved handle fits into my hand without feeling bulky or too slim.Razors have certainly come a long way since I started shaving with an old one blade razor many, many years ago!", "This five blade disposable razor has a water activated serum that provides soothing moisture.  After much badgering by his girlfriend, my brother finally decided to shave his less than impressive goatee. He used this product with a light application of shaving cream and was pleased with the results. His face is hair free and he likes the feel of his skin. He did not suffer from any nicks, cuts or irritation. He reported that the razor glided smoothly over his face. I note that he is not particularly hirsute, so those with thicker growth may be less satisfied. Its portability is a plus for travel.  Recommended.", "I always say it whenever I review a razor, because it's true- women get the best disposable razors. The Soleil line of razors is my go-to brand 90% of the time. I've used many different razors over the years, and have yet to find a men's razor that I can stick to. Schick's Hydro  5 disposable razors aren't going to take the place over my girly Soleils any time soon for two big reasons, but it's not a bad razor. The bottom line is, if you're happy with your electric or whatever razor you're using now, you should probably stick to it and pass on these.The Hydro 5 has, as you can tell just by the name, five blades. Because the Mach 3 wasn't enough, we get two extra blades that don't really add anything to the shaving experience. First I tried out the razor on my mustache area, using Axe Shield shaving gel. The Hydro 5 shaved like any other razor I've used, but as I would swoop up with the blades, I could tell that it wasn't getting everything because of how bulky it is. The hairs just directly below my nose were untouched and I had to re-do that spot several times before I finally got them. Shaving the front of my neck went a little better. Then there were the more...*ahem* sensitive regions that I used the Hydro 5 on. It did its job just as well as any other disposable razor I've used aside from the bulkiness.Bulkiness is one of the main problems I have with this razor, and the other is its lubrication strip. Using the Hydro 5 with shaving gel or even a regular bar of soap (I usually shave in the shower this way) leads to a lot of ooze on the shaved spots at first, and prevents the blades from cutting like they should. You'll have to press a bit harder now and then while shaving, and that's the kind of thing you shouldn't be doing for a razor with five freakin' blades.It's not a bad deal for 3 disposable razors. I'm going to stick with the Soleil brand though. They feel more sturdy and are smaller than this.", "Disposable razors are something I never buy now, but I loved Schick so I thought I would give these a try. They work great. They are very comparable to a regular razor they just don't last as long. They blade seems to get dull quicker then a regular razor. But I have never used a disposable razor this long and I have never had one work this well. I love these and will purchase them over and over.", "\"I've seen several programs on how women pay more for certain things like dry cleaning and razors and such.  I decided to see if this men's razor was the same as the women's razor that I use, especially since it did cost less (though not by much) and if I was paying more unnecessarily for something marketed specifically for women.I usually use either the Venus five blade razor, or the Schick Quattro (whichever is on sale or I have a coupon for).  I'm not necessarily brand loyal as long as the result is the same.  I use the Schick Hydro and I have to say that the shave was very good, but the feel of the grip, the weight, and the size of it felt foreign to me.  I don't know that I would buy these again, even though they are cheaper than women's razors and I don't know that the \"\"Hydro\"\" added anything for me.Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with it.  I was pleased with the result, but I prefer my women's razors better...even if they do cost a little more :)\"", "\"I was a little disappointed in this razor.  While the razor felt ergonomically fine in my hand, it didn't shave my legs any better than my cheaper three-blade razors.  The \"\"hydro\"\" part only allowed the razor to glide down my legs easier than the other brand, but afterwards my legs didn't feel silky smooth as anticipated.  The silky lotion seems to even have dried the skin more than usual, so that post-shaving moisturizers were required.\"", "This is a decent shave for a disposable. I like that I can shave quickly without cutting myself. It's just that it's not quite as close a shave as a regular Venus razor or the like (maybe that's good---fewer ingrown hairs). I think it's decent, though, and would recommend it.", "Used this a few weeks now and it's smooth and cuts very close.  So smooth that I dont feel any pain when i use it. My face feels like baby's butt after the shave. The quality is very nice, doesn't feel like disposable ones. It's been a few weeks and it still cuts like new.", "This doesn't feel like a disposable razor. It is sturdy and has a nice thick handle. I got a great and comfortable shave with it. Unfortunately, the price does not reflect a disposable razor either and it seems to me that you could get replacement razor heads for cheaper than these. If for some reason you need a razor to be disposable though, I would recommend these because they are so nice.", "I started shaving a long time ago. I remember single blade razors, though my first was twin bladed. Years later, I switched to three blades - mostly because I had little choice as the twin blade type became very hard to find. I have used nothing but Schick for many, many years.The later twin blade razors had a tab you could press that let you easily wash out the stubble and shave cream that stuck between the blades. The three blade type never had this feature and were always harder to clean after using.All of sudden there were four then five blade razors. I think they have stopped at five. I tried a four blade, but I found it awkward to use and much harder to rinse clean than the three blade I had been using. The three was still available, and I kept using those instead.I saw this five blade disposable on Vine and decided to try it to see what it was like.Remarkably, they have solved the cleaning problem. The gunk from shaving rinses clean under the tap, no problem. The shave is close and comfortable - the built in lubricant works well and needs to given all those blades.Is the shave itself any better than the three blade? If it is, not by much.I plan to stick to my three blades razors. Mostly, it is because the five blade model just feels a little awkward, clunky and harder to handle/control when shaving, especially in harder to reach areas.And one other thing, this five blader just looks so odd - the blade head and handle I mean. How many colors are needed in one razor? It looks like something made for young children, but then they don't shave. Seems like so many products have this look these days. A big turn off if you ask me. I'm an adult and like to use things that look like they are meant for adults.Of note is the price. The five blade razors are more expensive than the three blade type. I see no reason to pay a premium here.", "So obviously if I'm giving this razor 4 stars it's good for more than just travel use, but that is what it will be used for in our household.  I use anepilatorwith the occasional disposable razor at times and my boyfriend uses hisPanasonic Nanotech Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Electric Shaverregularly.  He had even taking to traveling with it until recently when somehow it was left behind at the hotel....over 150 miles away.  Thankfully it is a location that we return to often and we were able to retrieve it, but after that it was decided that it would no longer travel.TheSchick Hydro 5 Disposable Razorprovides a smooth, close, easy shave with no irritation.  He has used it in the shower and at the sink, bith having similar results.  Additionally the 5 blades do seems to provide a slightly better shave than the Mach 3 he had used in the past.  Overall a good quality disposable razor that you won't feel the need to retrieve if it gets left behind.", "For a disposable razor these aren't bad at all. They have 5 blades on each razor and the blades are good quality and didn't give me any cuts or razor burns. They give a nice close shave and do so without much skin irritation at all. I like the built-in hydrating gel strip that gives some added protection. The only place they irritated my skin was on my neck but that is always a trouble are for me. The cost is about average for a set of 3 five blade disposable razors. As long as the price is competitive then these will be one of my favorite choices.", "Everyone wants a sweet smooth silky shave for the summer months( and all year)especially.  This Schick Hydro 5 Disposable is sooooooooooo easy to use and such a nice feel to the skin when the shave is being administered  and afterwards.  There is no stinging and tight feel from the blade....there is only the feeling of silky smooth skin that is not taut and pulling as if it needs something else.  The stubbly hair is gone and the skin is healthy and so smooth you want to caress it over and over again....Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor", "The name/packaging of this razor is confusing in my opinion.  The 5 in Hydro 5 refers to the five blades each razor has not to the count of items you receive in each package which is three.  Like theSchick Hydro Silk for Women Razor (Colors May Vary)(which I loved) this is a fine razor though not quite as good as the Silk.  The handle is nice though, again, not as ergonomically excellent as the Silk's handle.  It's made of a combination of soft and hard plastic with most of the soft plastic having ridges that help the user grip the unit.  Like the Silk it has a layer of moisturizer above the blades which helps facilitate a comfortable shave.  It also has the added feature of a flip upper unit that lifts the moisture layer away from the blades allowing even closer shave.  I can't imagine needing that since the razor provides an awesome close shave as it is.  I don't recommend this but I actually used the razor on wet skin alone without soap and had not only a close shave but a comfortable one with no nicks or cuts.  The major negative with this shaver is its (current) high price.", "This is a great shave!  When I first used it (I shave in the shower) I wet the blades and started shaving, I did not think it was working since I did not feel anything, but than I felt my skin and it was smooth.  These razors are super sharp and the little coat of gel keeps your face hydrated and slick while shaving so the blades just glide right over it (you truly will feel that you are not shaving since you will not feel any hair being pulled or anything).  I felt the shave and it was super smooth their was no stubble or anything left, I held the blades under the shower water and washed out nicely and fits (a little big, but does fit) in my razor holder on my shower mirror.In the end this is a great razor, it provides a super smooth shave and the little gel stuff makes it just glide over the skin (I never use shaving gel).  After shaving my neck is smooth and their are no nicks (although, I rarely nick myself with any razor).  I really like these and highly recommend them for a fast and smooth shave!!Just to note, their are 5 blades (I always get either 3 or more blades) and their is no precision blade (single blade on top for precision shaving; I do not use this personally, but wanted you to know that it does not have it since a lot of other blades now a days have that back blade).", "As advertised the 5 blades provide a smooth shaving experience.  I'm not a gel user so not overly impressed with the gel, but if you're into that, will probably like this blade.  Good product but probably won't change from my standard Fusion razor.", "\"I recently went on a mini-vacation and the Hydro 5 Disposable Jetables came right along with me. I brought along and tried both the Hydro Silk Disposable Jetables targeted toward women and these.  I usually throw a small disposable in my suitcase, but don't often care to use them because inevitably I end up nicking my ankle.  It's difficult to take my electric razor and don't have much of an alternative.  The difference?  This is definitely a sturdier razor and the five blades gave a much closer, smoother shave than my regular disposables.Five blades do help and I didn't have to go over any areas twice.  My \"\"regular\"\" disposable is a pain in that regard.  I must admit the straight handle made it much easier to grip than the ergonomically-designed Hydro Silk.  The \"\"hydrating\"\" formula is the Aloe Vera.  Mind you, there's not a lot of it, but enough to moisturize and give a pleasant shaving experience if there is such a critter.  The only drawback is the price, but the Shick Hydro 5 Disposables Jetables are perfect if you only want to use them now and then.Hydro 5 Refill Blades(four-pack)INGREDIENTS:PEG 115M , Titanium Dioxide , Cyclodextrin , Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E) , Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice , Maltodextrin\"", "\"I'm not a big fan of disposable razors, but the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor is very good. It lacks the weight and feel of a non-disposable razor, but it still has good ergonomics. The hydrating gel reservoir makes shaving easy and smooth, without irritation. The razor also has a unique \"\"flip trimmer\"\" which works well. The razor's 5 blades seem to stay sharp for long time, as I've used 1 razor numerous times already and it still seems good as new. The only real downside to the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor is the cost. It's costs much more than most disposable razors, but you get what you pay for. It's among the best disposable razors I've used, and recommend it.\"", "As I opened the box, I caught a message on the packaging that claimed this is their best disposable shave or your money back.  That's certainly a strong statement and I was eager to see if this would be true for me.  It did a pretty good job almost to the parallel of my regular Schick.One razor can be used more than once, depending on your needs.  However, at this time(depending where you buy,) these cost more than cartridges.  I would use these for travel when I would not want to take my regular blade with me, as you can simply use this and throw it away after a couple of shaves and if you lose it, it was disposable anyway, right?  For your convenience it also have a cover on top when not in use.  If cost is not an issue, then these are indeed one of the best disposables on the market today.", "\"When I removed the razor from the package, I literally laughed. It looks like something straight from a Saturday Night Live sketch: \"\"Why buy a razor with three blades when you can have one with fifteen!?\"\" The over-sized appearance is super silly. Moreover, I have gotten much closer shaves from a \"\"simple\"\" (and less expensive) three-blade razor. This one is a bit cumbersome. Additionally, I first used it with a lotion and the razor skipped over and over. Then, I tried it without lotion, and it gave a better, but awkward shave. My underarms were left \"\"prickly\"\" even after several passes.If it matters, the aesthetics appear as though it is a generic razor. The instrument is a flat, opaque color. And, for me, was definitely not ergonomic. (It feels/looks like something from the 1980's with extra blades).In this case, for me, less is certainly more.\"", "when it's not on :--)a 5-blade razor that is both portable and disposable is both exorbitant and awesome. I like the feel of the handle and the shave it offers and the travel cap is a very welcome improvement.", "\"I've used the Hydro 5 with replaceable blades for a couple of years and love it, but my husband insists on an entirely disposable razor. When I had the chance to get these I took it. I've used one so far and it works just as well as the replaceable blades, though not quite as long -- two weeks for the \"\"regular\"\" razors to 10 days for these disposables. I think they last longer than the lady shavers so I tend to go with these instead. My husband loves these disposables, so I'm letting him have the other two in the package. He especially likes the conditioning strip on a hinge that allows him to pull it back when he doesn't need or want it. The handles are great for use in the shower, easy to hold and don't slip. The conditioning is good and is distributed evenly, instead of other brands where the conditioning strip lasts two shaves and then goes dry. These last the whole time, lessening as you use them of course, but they don't dry up so quickly. Very recommended.\"", "As a person that must shave frequently, I have tried over the years all kinds of razors, some the disposable type, some the ones you keep and buy more cartridges, and all in between. I done the electric shavers, and I still believe the best shave will come from razors, for the electric ones, even though more convenient, do not quite leave the face smooth of hairs. Areas like the neck have always been the most difficult, and only a very decent razor can do the job well. Of course, as the blade or blades loose sharpness it is time to replace blades or throw away the old disposable, and pick a new one.Gillette, Schick, I think are the big dogs in this category. One competes with the other and vice versa, so I was really eager to try the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, 3 Count, for sometimes nothing beats a disposable razor for convenience. The trick is to have a disposable razor that performs in a superior manner, where the difference with cartridges and disposables is blurred. Yes, in my view some disposables do the complete job, with the same level of performance of just about anything that is out there that can shave a man's face. I liked these razors, found them comfortable to hold, and with the proper shaving cream did an above average job. I use Nivea as of late, and I found out it works like one with this razor. I also think they are decently priced?I do not follow the science behind these disposable razors, for I have seen them being sold in packages of 50, which is a whole lot in my opinion. The life expectancy of these kind of blades fluctuates, I am sure, from consumer to consumer. Heard of a rumor that said that buying them in bulk was a mistake because with time the blades would become dull. I know there is an advantage to using disposables, and it seems the demand for disposables is very much alive. It would appear that price wise it is not a bad investment, for we all know how expensive the proglide cartridges are these days. They give 8 for almost $30!? I guess it comes down how many uses can you get from your razor and how well it shaves.No problems in getting a very decent shave, and as for their longevity, I have found they can be used enough times to where one does not feel cheated. I like the smoothness of the blades, I found it a little tedious to do the area right below the nose, but in the end I could look in the mirror and say to myself: Voila! Not a perfect product but certainly above average. Amazon, once again, gets my gratitude for letting me try this fine disposable razor. Yes, they are many out there, but not all are in the same league, and I can say with no doubt that as far as disposable razors are concerned, this Shick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, is a superior product compared to the really sad excuses for a razor that I have had the misfortune to try over time. Fine product, 4 Stars.", "Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razors are the best there is. When I got them in the mail, the hubs was super interested in confiscating one. I had to hide them from him. I love him, but these are great razors! I really enjoy the hydro part and the smooth shave.", "These are not great but they are still much better than the Schick Hydro silk version for women. They are not irritating. The Schick Hydro has a lubricating strip which is more sticky than lubricating. But it did not leave my skin irritated.The Schick Hydro did leave me with hair still on my legs though. It is pretty annoying. I am at a loss at to how 5 blades are an advantage if they are still missing hair. I am better off with with a cheapy one blade mans schick disposable and a bottle of shave gel.", "I always have to be careful with what razors that I use because I have very sensitive skin and can only use certain ones.  Some of them make me break out in a rash or bad razor burn. Was excited but apprehensive about trying something that I never have used before especially on my face.I was pleasantly suprised.  They were very smooth against my skin and also gave a close shave. Felt refreshing afterwards-that is probably because of the aloe vera and Vitamin E that helps with irritation.  Nice rubber handle and design of the product.Would purchase if on sale at the local CVS.", "Used this or my legs and underarms.It was a nice,smooth shave.No nicks.Would repurchase again on my own.", "The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor works surprisingly well.Pros: The razor itself hardly seems to have a curve or incline to the handle but even so,  the head with the five razors nicely follows the line you are shaving and travels along the face and removes hair smoothly without nicking.After shaving the skin does feel soft.Cons: None really - the razor is of course disposable, but holds up quite well.", "I was looking for a cheaper disposable razor that works to help offset the price of more expensive disposible blades.  This one looked to be a good deal as it also offered the 5 blade shaving method but it just didnt work as well.  The blades dulled pretty fast and it seemed to be tugging the hair out after awhile instead of cutting it. I probably wont be using these again as they dont offer a very smooth and painless shave.  I will pay more for a better shave."], "A": [0.03727060556411743, 0.03565182909369469, 0.022881781682372093, 0.032928042113780975, 0.03473600745201111, 0.021293476223945618, 0.04015333205461502, 0.00912491139024496, 0.036192070692777634, 0.03976481780409813, 0.04079548642039299, 0.03722817078232765, 0.029620196670293808, 0.03358916565775871, 0.03452520817518234, 0.027656855061650276, 0.026269005611538887, 0.03878036513924599, 0.04076337441802025, 0.007832778617739677, 0.019472049549221992, 0.04097088426351547, 0.03622326999902725, 0.034669600427150726, 0.022492285817861557, 0.02638726495206356, 0.029553871601819992, 0.02122671902179718, 0.04002390801906586, 0.029186727479100227, 0.0356220118701458, 0.03711392730474472]}
