{"reviews": ["Let me start by saying that Forza 4 was the best racing game I have played.  Ever.  I spent over 200 hours driving to acquire the &#34;Bucket List&#34; achievement, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The music, the tracks, the cars, everything fit perfectly.  That game (Forza 4) came out six years into the Xbox 360's life cycle.  Two years later the sequel (Forza Horizon doesn't count) is released on a new system and everyone is up in arms about how terrible it is.  Shockingly this opinion seems to be felt only by the Amazon community.  Most of the reviews I've read seem to be from trolls or casual Forza &#34;fans.&#34;  Here it is from someone who has spent a lot of time playing racing simulators, with over 1,000 hours invested in the Forza and Gran Turismo series.Graphics:  This is probably the first thing you will notice playing a next-generation system.  It is hard to describe how I feel about the graphics in this and Battlefield 4 (the only other game I own).  I would say that the textures look similar to previous-generation systems, but the amount of graphics displayed has increased tremendously.  I first noticed the crowds in the stands and the track-side detail.  It is impressive.  There is just a lot more &#34;stuff.&#34;  In Forza 4, the Sebring raceway seemed very open and spread out.  In Forza 5 it feels intimate, close up.  I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like you're driving through a real place.Content: In Forza 4 there were over 500 cars and 26 tracks.  Forza 5 has 200 cars and 14 tracks.  It is easy to recognize that you're getting about half of the content of Forza 4.  The big fear is that Microsoft will try to sell the &#34;missing half&#34; as DLC.  This remains to be seen, but I will pass on the DLC and wait for the sequel if it comes to that.  As it stands, it is better than what I expected for a launch title.  Everything has a very high level of polish and fits well.  The game seems designed to attract new players, as a lot of the menus and layouts have been simplified.  I honestly wish they would have borrowed more from Forza 4 in this case, but I can understand why they chose a different path.Driveatars:  This is probably the coolest addition to the game.  I love that as I write this, my driveatar is out there earning me credits and racing against other players.  It is really neat to watch the other cars race, as it shows you how other people handle the courses differently.  I've actually copied some of the driveatar techniques I've seen to see if it makes me faster.Global standings:  This is a minor point, but when you finish a race your fastest lap time is ranked world-wide.  It has definitely motivated me to re-race a couple of tracks just to get my time down.Physics:  The cars seem to have more &#34;heft&#34; than in previous Forza games.  It feels more realistic.  One of the complaints I had about Forza 4 was the glued-to-the-track feel of the cars with TCS on.  It feels much better with this one, you're no longer invincible with TCS on, the tires will break if you over-do it.In-game currency and micro-transactions:  This is where everyone is bashing Forza 5.  I honestly didn't notice the micro-transaction stuff until I read some of the reviews on here.  It isn't as &#34;in-your-face&#34; as everyone is making it seem.  The primary complaint revolves around the super-expensive cars, like the 6,000,000 credit Ferrari GTO.  If you want to pay for it in &#34;tokens&#34; it translates to $63.00 in real money (or somewhere in that range).  So let's be honest about this.  You can grind, as I did in Forza 4, to EARN this car or you can be an idiot and pay real money for it.  It is your choice.  I acquired the GTO at around the 180 hour mark in Forza 4, and trust me, it isn't anything special.  The only reason I bought it was because I had around 40,000,000 in game credits so I just bought all of the most expensive cars (achievement unlocked!).  Forza 5 is a little more conservative with doling out credits.  The main reason for this is that the credit multiplier has been reconfigured significantly.  I would earn 115% in credits in Forza 4 because of the way I set the difficulty.  With similar settings I now earn an additional 45%.  That said, I was driving my two favorite cars (Eagle Talon TSI and Dodge Viper ACR) within an hour of playing the game.  I'm sitting on around 500,000 in in-game credits with about 10 hours of gameplay.  And I've bought and modified several cars.  Bottom line, if you actually play the game, you will get the super-expensive cars.  There aren't as many cars in Forza 5, so you don't need as many credits as you did in Forza 4.  If you whine and complain that you can't drive the GTO on your first race you're not a gamer.  Go play &#34;Angry Birds&#34; on your iPhone.  If you are stupid enough to waste $63.00 on an in-game car, well, you know what they say about a fool and his money.Music:  My final point and biggest complaint about this game.  Forza 4 had one of the best original soundtracks for a video game in my opinion.  It was done just right.  They tried with Forza 5.  You can definitely tell that they tried.  Unfortunately it falls flat on it's face and comes across as one of the most pretentious and douchey soundtracks that I have ever heard.  It sounds like a bizarre combination of the soundtracks from the Lion King and Titanic, mixed in with big-band music from the 1950's.  It is very strange and has no place in a video game about cars.  When I listen to it I try to imagine the person who developed it.  I guarantee that whoever it is drives a Toyota Prius and can't tell you the difference between an air filter and a cabin air filter.  And they don't know how to drive a car with a manual transmission.", "Let's be honest, with Forza 4, most people never drove the majority of cars they had in their garages.I love Forza 5 for the same reason others are knocking it. Others are saying that it takes too long to earn money to buy all the cars but that's the biggest improvement over Forza 4. When it takes little effort to earn cars there is no feeling of accomplishment or reward when you get new cars. With Forza 5, unless you are willing to pay out cash, getting all the cars is going to take time and effort.When others complain that there are few tracks, this is a valid complaint but not one I have. For me, I prefer quality over quantity. All the tracks from previous games have been redone and the improvement is obvious. For example, I never really enjoyed Laguna Seca because I thought it had too many visibility issues but in Forza 5 it is one of my favorites.The biggest improvement in Forza 5 are the drivatars. WIth Forza 4, the AI drivers were predictable and beating them was just a matter of learning how they move, but with Forza 5 the drivatars are unpredictable and act like human opponents.Rather than focus on the number of tracks or cars, just enjoy the game. If Forza had 500 cars people would be complaining that most were slight variations. If Forza had 100 tracks, people would mostly play the top 20 as they did on Forza 4.Forza 5 has plenty of cars and tracks to keep you more than busy until Forza 6.", "\"PROS:- Top Gear. fantastic.- Playing Forza 5 while snapping Top Gear UK on Netflix is epic- visuals are beautiful- voice-overs are excellent- music is taken seriously, excellent. a far cry better than the usual wussy fake rock that you have to suffer through in most racers- turning off the assists and racing in the opposite direction is good for some laughs.- the fit and finish, shimmer and sheen of the game is glorious.NEUTRAL:- fairly long loading times- you don't race real life racers, you race your offline friend's avatars. okay I guess, that's fine...- your avatar wins credits racing against other people while you are not playing which is sort of neat, but the amount of credits earned isn't worth much.- if you don't know who the Top Gear folks are, the jokes, the insults back and forth, the Stig, none of this will make any sense whatsoever and in fact might be annoying. Not Everyone is a fan of the BBC...I'd personally like to see an entire Top Gear game from Turn 10 where I get to race insane nonsense creations against the hosts...CONS:- limited number of tracks. some are beautiful (Prague, etc) but you'll repeat them ad infinitum.- limited number of everything else, there are no weather effects, day/night, etc- although there are a decent amount of cars, there is no way to own a lot of them without playing this game every day for the rest of your life. earning credits takes too long so you will be required to pay real money to get them faster. spend a million credits on a car you don't like? tough luck. I even got 300,000 free by logging into the Forza website, but it doesn't matter. I'll need to race 30 races to get enough to buy a high performance car...I don't have that kind of time...- even if you come in every race 1st, you always start near last. there are no qualifying runs. starting near last means the guy in front doesn't have to contend with all the bumper car-style traffic nonsense that can knock you out of control...and you feel dirty hitting the Y button to correct it...- the game pointlessly uses 2 methods of purchasing power, credits and tokens. they do the same thing so why use 2?- the game sort of cheats from time to time. I played using the default settings. In a few races, I lost because the game AI assists would continuously break even though I was on a straightaway with nothing but a sea of blue arrows...I have NO IDEA what was going on there but it was NOT fun to see my car breaking for NO reason while cars sail on by...- I played beyond level 50, nearly all of the series, and yet I still don't think I \"\"figured out the trick to the game\"\" -- Do I pick speed? Acceleration? Speed, acceleration and handling? A good mix? Just pick the one they recommend? I could pick a car with all 10s and still spin out of control. Pick a different car with average stats and get through multiple series without hitting the REWIND button even once, never spinning out of control, not even when someone else hit me, or me them...After all this time, racing the same tracks over and over and over ad nauseum, I just don't \"\"get\"\" this game...In the end, I think MS needed some good launch titles fast and Turn10 churns out good products, so this is the result. With the limited number of tracks, etc, it feels unfinished. With the Top Gear guys, it feels glorious. It's a mix, just like the Xbox One itself...\"", "This game is gorgeous. Just. Downright. Gorgeous.It's a great time killer, Some of the pros are breathtaking thoughPROS:Top Gear Announcements: I LOVE the cut scenes with the top gear guys, giving me information on certain car types....it's such a great touch.Graphics -- WOW....CONTROL -- Wow x2Reverse - I like being able to un-screw myself, but I also like being penalized for doing so.Assists - They penalizing you for using them, but hey, what do you expect? This makes it so anyone can race.....ANY ONECONS***There is only one Con, and we should have seen this coming from a mile away: MICRO TRANSACTIONS. To hell with micro transactions...they are evil. They make the developer string along progress to be even longer... I have a theory on Microtransactions, I'll add that at the end if you would like to read it.CONCLUSION:Amazing, beautiful, breathtaking, time-consuming game.......with stupid micro transactions***A WORD ABOUT MICROTRANSACTIONS***A Large portion of our society falls into two categories: you either want stuff now without earning it, or you have an extreme value on feeling like you're busier than the next person..... I am the latter. I think Microtransactions not only feed on the &#34;right here right now&#34; crowd, but I think they also feed on the &#34;Rushing your way through life&#34; crowd. It's despicable.", "I really like these driving simulators, but every one I have played lacked something. Add a feature to one game and take it out of the next. I am also thinking of Gran Turismo 5 as I write this. I like off-roading and GT5 had none of that. GT2 and GT4 had some. I would say Forza never has, but I never played Forza Horizon so I am not sure about that one. I did not like being forced to do a race as soon as the game loads. Micro-transactions don't bother me much. I don't play it all day though. I am sure I would be as annoyed as most reviewers if I did. Downloaded it off Xbox Live so no proof I own it on here, but I do have it.", "Needs some work with the controls.  Joystick too sensitive.  Started to buy a &#34;Wheel&#34; control but the reviews on most of them indicated a lot of the same problems...", "This games is so stripped down a riddled with micro transaction. Forza 4 was the peak of this series. I would definitely go with Gran Turismo 6 over this.", "I love this game. Best Forza let. The graphic are stunning an game play is amazing.", "Looks great, but is lacking in content. And the system for unlocking what little content there is, is frustratingly bad to say the least. I dont know if its a case of launch game norms or what, but this is plagued with the exact same problem as the badly reviewed Ryse. It just seems they went more for looks over gameplay / content.", "There's a lot of hubub about microtransactions.  I haven't felt the need to spend real money.  The game looks and plays better than ever.  There are fewer cars and tracks, but this is an entirely new product.  What's there is good--really good.  Every car is modeled precisely inside and out.The multiplayer works without a hitch.If you liked Forza in the past, this is worth your while.Also, they've reduced the prices of cars to make them more attainable with in game credits.  Be sure to sign up for Forza Rewards.  I got 4 million in game credits for my last reward.  Plenty to buy the most expensive cars in the game.", "Not really much to say other than it is next installment of the best racing franchise.If you like racing cars and have an X1 buy it.", "\"REVIEW UPDATE: 4/9/2014I have updated my review from 2 stars to 4 stars.  This is because Turn 10 has actively listened and responded to fan feedback, and has made changes.These changes include:- Adjusted career winnings.- Reduced car prices.- Increased \"\"Forza Rewards\"\" money.- Road America track download for FREE.- Long Beach Circuit track download for FREE.As a result of these changes, the game required much less grinding to build up your garage.  Buying tokens now feels like an optional shortcut instead of a necessity.  It feels less like the \"\"free-to-play\"\" business model that it did before.I'd like to give the game a 5 star rating, but the microtransaction monetization scheme is still present... even if it much less obnoxious now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Turn 10 and Microsoft are charging $60 - $80 for Forza 5, depending on the version you get. However, despite the full price tag, they are treating this like a \"\"free-to-play\"\" game. As it aggressively pushes for microtransactions.You might hear a lot of players say \"\"Oh, you don't need to buy tokens!\"\" And they're right, you don't NEED to, but the game has been designed from the ground up to milk extra cash out of you.Proof:- The storefront is gone- The auction house is gone- Gifting cars to your friends is gone- Sharing your cars in a Club is gone- Earning cars as level rewards is gone- Affinity bonuses don't get you free parts anymore- You can't sell cars back for money anymore- You can't sell parts back for money anymoreThe end result of these changes is this:Getting new cars is a LOT more time consuming. Earning enough money to buy and upgrade multiple exotic cars requires excessive grinding... or buying tokens of course.Forza 5 throws out so many of the things that made previous Forza titles great so that they can milk their loyal customers as much as possible. It's like a slap in the face to someone like me, who has been loyal to the franchise for eight whole years.Skip this entry. With any luck Forza 6 will avoid these downfalls.\"", "this game is the epitome of all simulation racing games or was. i played forza since forza 2 and i can easily say this isnt much of an improvement from forza 4. even though forza will always win racing game of the year in the end that doesnt matter. what matters i the gamers satisfaction, the replay value, and how innovative a franchise and its developers can be. forza 4 won racing game of the year not too long ago but even i and other critics claimed that it wasnt much of an improvement from forza 3 and its the exact same situation with forza 5. u dont have to take my word for it but forza 5 is pretty much forza 4 with updated commentary from the top gear uk hosts and a new drivatar ai system. this game only lasted my a couple of weeks. dont get this game if u want to play something for a long time. instead get plants vs zombies garden warfare when it comes out!", "I am not a big racing fan but this game is amazing!(if you are a racing fan you will definitely not be disappointed) the level of detail is great in Forza 5 and the cars handle how they would in real life.I got this game 2 weeks ago and have already spent 20 hours on it,great game,buy it!", "This is a good game, but if I had to do over I would pass on it and see what comes up for the next version, if they get rid of the charges for extras. A few reasons:-It plays very well. Think Forza 3 or Forza 4 with better graphics.  But that is the problem. It is an upgrade to those versions, but not by a ton in the graphics dept.  In all honesty, after playing it, we all thought, wow, that looks great, but then we went in the other room to play the 360 versions of Forza 3 or Forza 4 because they simply have more depth to them.  Once you are driving the cars, the graphics aren't enough of an upgrade where it makes a huge difference.-There is just too much content missing, or content you have to pay for. With the 360 versions of the game, you get a TON more cars and a LOT more tracks.  With Forza 5, you simply get a slight upgrade in graphics of the 360 versions, but with a lot less content,  And by a lot, I mean a LOT.Of course they want you to pay for extra cars and tracks.  If this game cost $29 at retail, I can understand charging for extra cars and tracks.  But not at full retail price.If you never played or owned any previous Forza games, this might be a good purchase. But if you own Forza 2, 3, or 4 for your 360, you will find this purchase a waste of money.", "It's a beautiful looking game, and it's undeniably fun for a while but it just, I'm sorry to say, gets boring. It seems to take an age to get anywhere, it's hard to get back to the main menu to configure things and it's just race after race after race, often on the same tracks. I also hate that, like $1.99 iPhone games that you can pay to advance further. C'mon, we paid $60 for this, don't nickel and dime us.In all fairness, that's a reason for me to never buy another Turn 10 title.In more all fairness, it is a good looking fun game up to a point and a nice way to show your friends what your new xBox One can do, but it's still very, very disappointing.", "this game earned every single star u see!i luv forza horizons&can't wait to see horizons#2 on xbox1.full 1080p/60 fps!?uhhh YES!lol ppl doubting the Xbox1 need2 see this game flow&thats the perfect word for this amazing sim type game.best racer out here till maybe GRAN TURISMO comes out on Ps4 maybe?lol idk,but we will see.turn 10 studios really stepped up there game on this one thats for sure ppl!!can't wait to get deeper into the game.cars handle like they look to omg.just happy to have this game&i got a deal used to save $$$looks brand spanking new!someone took excellent care of this disc lol.this games worth every penny.i can't wait to buy car paks on xb live.they give 2x the car count i see too!?bout time.360 only gave u 5-6 cars or so?u get like 10+ etc cars now ea pak?awesome!ha GET THIS GAME THRU AMAZON OK?Have fun on ur Xbx1", "I have played this game and love the physics, graphics, and everything about it. BUT, with the restrictions in cars and tracks to race, the game will not last as long as Forza 4. I played for about a month, and now it's just sitting in the corner picking up dust. Games like Battlefield and Call of Duty or Titanfall, these are games which will keep you satisfied for a very long time. Forza, not as much. Unless you were playing Forza 4 for multiple years without losing interest, I don't recommend spending your money on this game. But besides that, graphics are definitely the best on the Xbox One so far.", "Microtransactions, everywhere. Yes, this game should be free with how much they try to rip you off with in game purchases. It's on the same level as an android or iphone game begging for money.They also had to lower the graphics by A LOT to get it to do 1080p and 60fps. If you compare video of it at E3 when it was obviously running on a high powered PC, compared to the version we got on Xbone. It's just sad. They removed buildings, lowered texture quality, removed a lot of shadows and light effects. They tuned down everything to get it to run at those stats. I would have preferred a 480p game if it would mean they could have left all the other stuff in. Just a terrible excuse of a game. Please skip this unless you have hundreds of dollars to waste buying cars instead of earning them.", "When I first got my Xbox 360 my friend brought over at game that he just got. I am not big on driving games but when he booted up this game I wanted to play it. The game was Forza 3 and it is a game that I still play to this day. Now with a new release of a console the folks over at Turn 10 studios have released Forza 5. But is this going to be the ultimate drive experience on the Xbox One or should you drive on by?As with the previous games in this series you will be racing in various tracks in an array of supercars all over the world. But one of the newest features of this game is called the Drivatar. I could spend pages describing what this is but in a nutshell it is a copy of you. Your Drivatar will copy your driving habits, quirks and skill and can compete with other people all over the world. Just like the ad says &#8220;even when you&#8217;re sleeping it is racing&#8221; making for a very interesting concept ever unleashed on a driving game.One of the most crowning achievements of this game has to be the graphics. Forza 5 has some of the most breathtaking graphics of any racing game to date. Taking full advantage of the new Xbox One platform you will be able to see the tracks, cars and even the crowd in full detail. It feels as if you are truly behind the wheel of a supercar driving around some of the most breathtaking tracks ever created digitally.The only problem that I had with this game was that there is less content than its predecessor. Forza 4 had around 500 cars and 27 circuits while this incarnation has around 200 cars and 14 tracks. Additional tracks and cars are going to be released in monthly installments and available as a DLC for a fixed price on the marketplace. This also means at some point there is going to be a Forza 5 Ultimate edition with all of this content included. Now you don&#8217;t have to go out and get this additional content but I feel as if this is a way to nickel and dime players of Forza.If you are looking for a great racing game on launch day then Forza 5 is the way to go. With unique features, a wealth of cars and tracks and wonderful graphics this might be the best Forza game to date", "I've been in love with racing games since I first played Night Driver on the Atari 2600 (and for anyone that thinks the progressive runner like Temple Run is original try Night Driver.)  Heck, I even loved the electro-mechanical racing games at the arcades way back before the Atari days.Anywho; this FORZA 5 is the bizomb.  What a great game.  Looks absolutely stunning.  Handles like a charm.  I know others may rip on it for having less tracks/less cars but it's a launch game and I for one would rather be playing it and buying Forza 6 in another year with more upgrades then reading about another delay like DriveClub.Seriously it's got me mesmerized and full disclosure-I thought Forza Horizon was the best racer ever.  The driving in this game just compels me regardless of any features it has (which was excellent) or lacking as of yet.Now for any of my dear followers from my prior posts I had a bit of a significant conniption fit that almost caused me to stroke out just trying to hook up the Xbox One the night I bought it but I got over the angst once it got over trying how to update itself and we've been in blissful love ever since.  Sure, I know it's gonna eventually crap the bed on me as my previous Xbox 360s did but till then call me a fool."], "A": [4.746467539007426e-07, 3.332773612640949e-09, 0.0027055819518864155, 0.046676721423864365, 0.032097332179546356, 0.10463673621416092, 0.00083034613635391, 0.14074121415615082, 0.006519225891679525, 4.412354246596806e-05, 0.2145882397890091, 0.07101843506097794, 0.005851665511727333, 0.2093099057674408, 0.0009024035534821451, 0.006765556987375021, 7.295762043213472e-05, 0.04284307733178139, 0.1086486205458641, 3.5646439755510073e-06, 0.005743884947150946]}
