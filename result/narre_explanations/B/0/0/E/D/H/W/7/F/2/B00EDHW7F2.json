{"reviews": ["I love this coffee - smooth, nice caffenated kick :), and great price (I'm estimating it will be less than 50 cents a K-cup once it is available on Amazon, based on the prices of Caza Trail Donut Shop elsewhere, and price of Caza Trail K-cups on Amazon).Many coffees and particularly K-cups seem to have a bitter taste. I have only found a few I like, and I find this to be medium-bodied and VERY smooth. I love it.My new go to based on balance of great flavor and great price.", "In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I received a sample box of this product.  I tried not to let that affect my evaluation.This Caza Trail donut shop blend coffee is a good value for the dollar.  It is priced well below the mainstream K Cup varieties from Green Mountain, Tully's, Starbucks, etc.  However, the coffee doesn't taste cheap.  I used their capsules, which are comparable to original K Cups in design, and found that the coffee was an acceptable medium roast.  I can even get away with making the larger cups on my brewer at home without it becoming too watery.  Not bad.  Given the price, you might want to check out this company's varieties.  I'm eager to try more to see if I can find a &#34;go to&#34; replacement for the more expensive brands.", "As the price of k cups periodically increases, it is a welcome offering when a new brew is introduced that is a fine blend at a reasonable cost.The Casa Trail Donut Shop Blend is a true robust coffee flavor without bitterness or aftertaste.For those who like it stronger brew a smaller cup, for those who like it more mellow, brew a larger cup.  All brew sizes deliver a fine coffee experience.", "This is a very strong, bold, smokey flavored coffee. My husbands the type that sets the Keurig to say a 6oz setting when making coffee so that it's more concentrated but boy not with these! They are not for a blonde coffee drinker. So lots of flavor for a low price.", "I recently tried the Caza Trail Columbian Blend Fair Trade Coffee. I like a wide variety of coffee but Columbian coffee is typically one of my favorite options. I have tried Caza Trail coffee before in several different varieties and I have always liked it. This Columbian Blend coffee is good as well. It has a nice flavor and is really smooth. It almost tastes like a breakfast blend or doughnut shop coffee. I think it has a slightly milder flavor than most good Columbian coffee. It&#8217;s a good coffee for first thing in the morning with toast or breakfast. I have also used it to make caf&eacute; mocha&#8217;s and with other flavored creamers and it tasted good as well. This coffee is fair trade certified so you know it was produced under honest and fair working conditions. This box comes in a package of 52 so they will last a while and the K-Cups are the regular and typical type so they are quick and easy to use. If you like a rich and medium roast coffee that is good for everything then this coffee might be a good option for you.", "As an owner of a Keurig for less than a year, I have spent some time looking for the perfect K-Cup to satisfy my own personal taste and the taste of my more discriminating son. We have found some winners in our quest and also some total losers. In my own opinion the Caza trail K-Cups meet my definition of a good cup of coffee. They are not overly strong but have a full bodied taste. My son did not like them as well. He prefers a much stronger cup of Joe. We can both agree that the price is right - this box of K-cups is quite affordable.", "It isn't the best coffee I have ever had but it is good. I thought it had a little bitterness to it but the flavor was decent, my husband likes this too. I'm not sure if I will buy this again or not because of the bitterness I could taste. I normally buy the green mountain breakfast blend. I like a weaker coffee so I used the largest cup setting for this and it was fine for me.", "I didn't like this coffee blend at all.  It is weak, even in a small cup.  I took some of the cups to work and it went over well. Perhaps it was just me because I do like stronger offer.  Based on the difference between my reaction and that of my co-workers, I find it difficult to rate this product.  I'm giving it 3-stars because I believe that it did lack flavor and depth.  I hope to try another Casa Trail blend in the future that may have a more positive appeal to my taste buds.", "I typically brew an 8 oz cup out of my Keurig, and usually go with black in the mornings, a little cream in the afternoons, and more cream in the evenings. (Yes, I drink coffee all day.)Next issue: K-Cups are not cheap, even if you get into the newer brands that are offered. You'll want to price shop, but Keurigs aren't really about cheap, they're about easy.Taste: the Donut Shop Caza Trail coffee has a strong coffee taste. There's no additional flavors trying to hide that reality, and it's a good thing here. The coffee is not one with subtle notes of anything--it tastes like fresh coffee. Which, considering the local donut shop's coffee tastes more like burnt rubber, is an improvement for the Caza Trail Donut Shop over my local one.As a coffee for adding differing creamers to, it's a good base flavor to pour a bit of French Vanilla or other flavor into.I like it--if the price is right, (which is currently debatable) this is worth adding to your coffee stockpile.", "I usually like really full bodied coffee yet many K cups I find are bitter tasting...and I love a flavored coffee but they usually taste like colored water. I was really pleasantly surprised to find this has a great taste. Not too light and not too dark, no bitterness. I'm not sure what the retail price is going to be (I received a 56 count box) as at the time of this review, the item (the 56 count box) it not available, so, I can't comment on the value for price. For some sort of guidance (because everyone has different taste buds) - I like Caribou coffee but dislike the original Donut Shop brand donut shop coffee (yet I like Donut Shops chocolate donut).So, if you are looking for something with depth (gah! I'm not even sure if I'm explaining this correctly - I am not a coffee snob - so I don't know all the terms!) this is a great coffee. It won't curl your toes, put it will put some pep in your step (obviously, I'm not a poet either!). Recommend!Edit to add: I use either the 6oz or 8oz size on my Keurig. Use one pack of Truvia and about a teaspoon of creamer when making my coffee.", "These k-cups are not only a great value, but the coffee is delicious. I like mine medium generally with cream and sugar, so if you are a strong coffee drinker, you may want something a little stronger, but for me, the strength is perfect and rich, not at all bitter.", "Caza Trail Donut Shop Blend single serve cups is depicted on the carton a producing a medium strength brew in my Keurig. I brewed three different cups of coffee using these cups, all at the full cup size on my brewer.  I have no idea what donut shop blend signifies inasmuch as it has been years since I bought coffee at a donut shop. The coffee doesn't have very much aroma and not too much flavor either. It brews a very weak cup of coffee to my palate. On the other hand, my husband, who doesn't like strong coffee, rather liked the brew. We both drink our coffee black. Sometimes, depending upon my mood, I will add a flavored creamer. I wouldn't think of doing that with this blend because any of the coffee flavor would disappear altogether.", "I'll admit I am not a big fan of Caza Trail coffee usually. I've had quite a bit of it in variety packs of K-cups and I've given a lot of it away. It's not bad, but it is not great either.I had not tried the donut shop, so I decided to give it another go.I found that it has a good flavor and produces a fairly strong cup of coffee at the 8oz surviving size.  I still prefer the actual Dunkin Donuts products, or even theDonut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)over this one, but I'll give it a 4-star rating because it was the best Caza Trail product I've tried yet.  Maybe they are starting to improve?", "These K cup style coffee single serves are really good! Plus, the flavor choices are immense- but the best part of single serve, is just that- one perfect cup at a time- with no mess or coffee pot to clean up!", "I really prefer bold coffee, but this is a bit mild.  The nice thing about this coffee is it does not give me heartburn and some strong coffees do.  At the right price, I would purchase it.  It has a good taste just a bit weaker than I like.  If you like coffee and don't like it too strong, this is a good coffee.", "I really enjoyed this. Medium to light roast and very flavorful with light acidity. No more Green Mountain Nantucket for me. I have found a replacement.", "\"If you like \"\"coffee\"\" - not dark, not bitter, not roasted to within an inch of its life, not flavored with hazelnut or chocolate - but just straight American style coffee, this k-cup is a perfect fit.It's mild and well balanced, without the bitter notes that some heavily roasted Starbucks style blends get.  It basically tastes like a good cup of coffee, and is currently well priced too.I like it a lot.  Of course, I also like all those more gimmicky coffees, and one of the great things about the Keurig is you can try a bunch of crazy things without making a whole pot, but Caza Trail is great for when I just want \"\"coffee.\"\"  Highly recommended for compatible drinkers.\"", "Flavor: It has a reasonably bold flavor, which I like (I find k-cups are often weak in flavor relative to what you'd get at a coffee shop for instance).  And it doesn't have a much acidity or after taste - clean finish.  I wouldn't call it complex or particularly interesting - just a good basic coffee.Packaging - regular box.  Would have preferred a perforated top that can store in the cabinet without pulling it out to get the kcups.", "This was a nice balanced coffee for a good price.  It brews well and add bonus that it is fair trade.  Would certainly buy again!", "Really good tasting coffee at an affordable price for you Keurig a smooth, mild and consistent choice.  The aroma will lead yourself into a good start of your day.", "I'm pretty picky about coffee and love a dark roast. That said, I loved this blend. For when you don't want you coffee to slap yourself awake, this is your blend. It is perfect for a coffee break at work. I shared some with the office staff and everyone liked it. I've tried some K-cups that were really bitter, but not this blend. All the pods look fine and have performed as expected so far. If the price remains as fair as it is now, I will be trying the bold blend next.", "We've had our Keurig since Christmas 2012 and often wonder how we lived without it.  We have tried many different brands and flavors and were happily surprised to find this coffee.  It is one of the very best we have tried so far, so smooth but strong enough even on the largest cup setting.  I look forward to trying their other flavors as we really enjoy a nice variety of coffees.", "\"Since receiving myKeurig K75 Single-Cup Home-Brewing System with Water Filter Kit, Platinumcoffee maker last year, I've grown to really like a variety of different coffees.  I've zeroed in on a few that are my favorites, but I'm always open to trying new ones.So when offered an opportunity to try this Caza Trail Colombian Fair Trade, I jumped at the chance.I'm glad I did -- I quite liked it!I'm a \"\"medium-roast\"\" person -- dark roast always tastes burnt to me, with a bitterness I just don't like.  Also, I use the middle cup-size setting - 8 oz. - as I've found that seems to give me the \"\"strength\"\" of flavor I like best.  When I test coffee, I use that setting, and drink at least one cup plain black, and at least one with sweetener and creamer.This one is a very nice medium roast, very similar to Caribou BlendCaribou Coffee Caribou Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 50 count, but with just a hint of \"\"sharpness\"\" to it.  Describing coffee flavor/taste is such a subject thing -- so I'll do my best, but ultimately it's up to you.  Caribou Blend is my all-time favorite, so if you like that, you'll find the taste of this very similar.It has a rich flavor that really shines when served black, but it's robust enough to stand up to sweetener and creamer without losing anything.Definitely thinking about adding this to my subscribe and save list -- it's an economical alternative to pricier similar K-cups.\"", "I like donut shop blends usually, so I thought I'd try this one out. I've found some of the medium and dark blend K Cups to be too harsh for my stomach, but this one was really smooth and had a really good flavor. I like it better than many of the other brands I've tasted, and I've tasted a lot.If you're a coffee snob, I'm not sure this is for you. I'd imagine this will be at a mid-range price when it's released, but if you just like a good cup of joe. I recommend.", "I had my doubts about this coffee.  I had not heard of this brand.  But when I tried it I was quite impressed.Nice taste, smooth finish and really rivaled other well-known brands.I have had a few other people try this out when visiting and they too were impressed and wanted to know where they could get this coffee.Really a great coffee that won't disappoint.", "Donut Shop coffee is my usual coffee.  I do order different blends on Amazon.  This one is the closest to the Donut Shop coffee I usually buy and at a lower price.  One of the better coffees that I had never heard of.", "Caza Trail K-Cup coffee taste good. It tastes much like a donut shop blend more than a specialty coffee brand. For the price of 52 K-cups, this is a great deal, I think, for a good tasting coffee without breaking the bank.", "We enjoyed drinking Caza Trail Donut Shop coffee for Keurig K-Cup brewers.  The coffee is less harsh than the Dunkin Donuts Donut Shop K-Cup but still has that pleasing aroma to awaken your senses early in the morning.  I typically brew a medium cup and then a small cup with this particular K-Cup and find it is the perfect strength for my particular taste.  The K-Cups come in a cardboard box with 56 cups inside.  If you have a large family or want to be the hero in the office then this is the ideal purchase!", "This is a basic medium brew that surprised me with the smooth flavor and my family enjoyed them as they have no bitter aftertaste. I would have these on hand for guests who prefer something other than the dark roast we usually have on hand at our house. You cannot beat the price vs. other more expensive k cups and I compare the flavor to Starbucks House blend in terms of smoothness and this brand is definitely one I will put in my K cup rotation.", "I loved the price for the amount of k-cups right off. I prefer flavored coffee, but need to keep plenty of regular for visitors. My folks don't care for strong coffee, so this was just right - a medium brew. I had never heard of the brand before, but I was pleasantly surprised with the nice taste. I would definitely get this again.", "As someone fond of lighter roasts, I like most Donut Shop blends. I say 'like' because most miss the mark when it comes to coaxing any degree of depth from a light roast.This one is no different.Fairly bland, although using less water helps. Decent caffeine buzz, however, so nice for foggy mornings.", "I really like this coffee and have had no trouble with the pods.  They have a medium roast flavor not too strong and not too weak.  I always make a 10 1/2 oz. mug and it's perfect each and every time.  Best part is, which they don't tell you in the description, they are made with 100 percent arabica coffee.  Yes I'm picky and I prefer Arabica over any other coffee blend so this is great and the price is really good.  You'll pay alot more for a better brand name that will taste exactly the same so why not try these.  You won't be disappointed."], "A": [0.01276132557541132, 0.027664974331855774, 0.033780548721551895, 0.02779608964920044, 0.016576780006289482, 0.014832480810582638, 0.05459382385015488, 0.01735614240169525, 0.010042103938758373, 0.02592148818075657, 0.05045469105243683, 0.02076828107237816, 0.02071702480316162, 0.048883676528930664, 0.02943023294210434, 0.045588668435811996, 0.02938278205692768, 0.023555254563689232, 0.05702127888798714, 0.06581731885671616, 0.028349118307232857, 0.040915876626968384, 0.01781691424548626, 0.0308221485465765, 0.04423457756638527, 0.055766984820365906, 0.047466907650232315, 0.005776860751211643, 0.016643015667796135, 0.041162945330142975, 0.019601285457611084, 0.018498379737138748]}
