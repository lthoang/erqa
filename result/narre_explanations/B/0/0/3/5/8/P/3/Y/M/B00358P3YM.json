{"reviews": ["Great price for the product.  Fits my 17in macbook pro with room to spare.  Slim, not bulky.  Cool look.  Better than other more expensive products.", "\"I actually carry a 12.1\"\" laptop in this bag. I needed the extra space for my adapter, portable mouse,external hard drive, 2 USB drives, 4 pens, 4 disks, phone charger, and miscellaneous documents. They all fit well in this bag. With all of this, I can fit a 1.5\"\" full binder and it will still zip up. The shoulder strap is comfortable and I can adjust the plastic piece on the strap doesn't dig into my shoulder. The padding on the inside of the bag holds my laptop well, even though my laptop is smaller than the bag is meant for. There are plenty of pockets and everything zips up, so I'm not paranoid that I dropped a pen or cable. On a side note, I was able to fit a huge HP ZD7000 17\"\" laptop and it's giant 110 watt adapter into this bag just fine. The weight did bother my shoulder, but it was probable less an issue with the strap, and more of an issue of the laptop and adapter weighting 12 LBS together.\"", "I bought this bag for my new laptop. It is reasonably sturdy and well made for the price. It has pockets for your mouse or power supply or whatever. No complaints.", "Imagine the inside of a camping tent. This is what this bag is like on the inside and the outside. Do not like the cover, do not like the clasp, do not like the cheap feel of it. Bad choice and poor taste. Was a mistake to buy this.", "\"It's bigger than I really need, and not in the directions where I could put extra space to the best use:  it's too tall and wide, and doesn't expand forward or back (or in any direction.)  The compartments are well thought-out, and the ones that need it have a good layer of foam in between them; however, the foam's pretty dense and solid - without a lot of \"\"smoosh\"\" to it.  This is good for adding ridgity to a bag that's big enough to need it and doesn't add too much weight, but again, not really features I need very often.It fits my Dell Studio 17 with inches to spare in every direction, and due to the padding between compartments, lets me carry the external drive, charger, mouse, etc with confidence.  On the rare occassions I need to transport it, this bag is the best I have for it.  While it's not going to pass the Timex Elephant test, the case itself would pass the Samsonite Gorilla test with ease... although the laptop would be a goner (so I'll try to keep it away from the elephants and gorillas.)\"", "\"The Caselogic \"\"17-Inch Laptop Messenger Bag\"\" is a very nice case, suitable for carrying larger laptops (up to 17\"\" wide). While this would not be my choice for an extended trip requiring a lot of extra peripherals and files, it is almost perfect for day to day use. Here are my observations:* Main Compartment;+ Handles Large Laptops - easily fits my 15\"\" wide Compaq CG60 Laptop+ Has a pocket for USB Thumb Drives+ Zipper is good quality+ Reasonably Well Padded (but I wouldn't check this through airline baggage handling)* Outside \"\"Speed Pocket\"\";+ Convenient for small items like keys, cell phones, etc- Zipper is hard to open and does not feel very durable* Outside Flap;- Closure is made of metal and it hooks on a sturdy loop, but it does not securely latch* Internal Compartments;+ Large \"\"Document Pocket\"\"+ \"\"Power Pocket\"\" is a large general purpose area that can be used for power supplies, DVD drives, etc+ \"\"Accessory Pockets\"\" are inside a zippered area and can be used to hold a mouse, pens, supplies, etc- This area can get bulky fast and the padding is somewhat thinner than I would like* Shoulder Strap;- Not enough padding- Plastic clip body with metal latch, but I am concerned about the long term durabilityOverall, this is a very nice case that I will be using for carrying my laptop almost every day but, due to the under-padded shoulder strap and limited space for peripherals, not for my longer trips.RecommendedCFH\"", "\"This may not be the fanciest laptop bag, but it does the job and has plenty of features that proved to be very useful on a recent trip. If you're looking for something fashionable, this is not the bag for you. But if you're looking for  comfort, durability, a good price and a simple useful design, then you can't go wrong.The bag fit my 17\"\" laptop perfectly and there was plenty of padding to keep it safe. My laptop is heavy enough, so I definitely appreciate that the bag was very light and did not add any additional bulk. There is a small pocket on the top flap that is great for keys, flash drives, etc. Inside compartments provide room for cords, extra batteries, pens, writing pads, etc. As a woman, I still need my purse, but I think most guys can get away with the laptop bag alone since there's so much room for the extras.The shoulder strap was very comfortable and was padded with what I believe is faux leather. The luggage strap also came in useful and attached easily to my carry on. I had a small spill, and it was very easy to wipe off the material and move on.\"", "This provides plenty of room for my 15-inch laptop, and room for much more. Like any laptop bag, it bulges when you add items to the pockets. It feels like it protects the laptop rather well, but I'm not dropping it everywhere. My only complaints are the material is a bit noisy when you move the flap. Also, the flap secures with a hook and strap, which is relatively difficult to connect when the bag is at one's side. Velcro would have been better, though perhaps less stable.In addition, the USB pocket on the inside is very convenient. The outside pocket on the flap is definitely a plus, though the zipper is a little tricky to tuck away.", "\"After browsing around a bit on Amazon for a bag for my new Pavilion dv7 (17.3\"\") I came across this model.  I really liked the look and price.This particular bag has a zipper across the top which allows access to the computer storage compartment.  You do not unzip an entire flap, nor can you adjust any bolsters or velcro straps.  You unzip and slide the computer into the compartment.  Now, my Pavilion has the extended battery pack that sticks out a good 3/4\"\" from the bottom of the computer, and even with this added thickness, the computer fits easily into the compartment and the side fit is just about exact.You definitely wouldn't want to send the computer as checked luggage in this bag, nor would I say it's highly protected; but it's adequately protected and access/removal is ultra fast.After inserting the computer and zipping the zipper, you flip the 'messenger' flap over the top and can buckle the flap with a Z-style hook.  It's not that secure and the flap can come open although this isn't of any consequence for the computer and would only matter if you were an actual bike messenger with loose papers shoved in the flap.  There is a decent over the shoulder strap with light padding, connected to the bag by plastic/metal hooks & D-rings of average-appearing strength.There are miscellanous other compartments under the aforementioned flap for papers, USB sticks and I could fit my power cord & brick, too.Overall it's an understated bag almost 100% black with tiny bits of silver piping on the handle that amounts to nothing and teal blue inside.  I like the black, simple exterior and ease of use.  I also like that it's not covered with zippers and bulging with pockets everywhere on the exterior.Perfect for those looking for a light to medium duty 17.3\"\" bag to tote a laptop and a few files to and from the office; but don't expect it to stop bullets, and don't toss the bag across the room onto your desk when you get to work.\"", "The Caselogic Messenger bag is designed to hold 15-17 inch lap tops. Light weight the bag sports several pockets to hold a computer, a few folders or other items. A zippered front pocket has several compartments including two small ones which are perfect for a cell phone and/or Ipod.The basic black exterior works well in a business environment and goes with everything. Inside the lining is a rich blue with a silky touch.The Caselogic bag sports a handle to tote it with but includes a shoulder strap as an alternative method.Overall this is a classic black computer bag with nice features at a good price point.~ Lee Mellott", "I picked this up to replace my old leather laptop case which is falling apart after seven years of constant use. Although this is definitely a step down due to the lack of compartments and the cloth is nowhere as durable as the leather, this is balanced out by the exceptionally nice price Amazon is selling this at. It's too bad that the case isn't selling for a penny more so you can get Super Saver Shipping, but that's why I have Amazon Prime. :-)I've recently taken this case on two long trips - one from D.C. to Ohio and one from D.C. to West Virginia and the case held all my laptop and its acessories just fine without any noticeable wear or tear. My laptop is a 17-inch one so it was nice and snug in the case. I wouldn't recommend this for a laptop under 15 inches as it may slide around a bit and thus get scuffed in the process.Overall, this is a fine little no frills laptop case and for those of you on a budget, you really can't do much better than this. It's lightweight and although it won't hold up as long as a leather or hard case, you'll definitely get your money's worth from this purchase.", "\"Nice and roomy, lots of compartments, and great features!  I wanted a bag for my new 17.3\"\" laptop, and didn't like the prices of what I was finding at Walmart and other places.  Then I found this nice bag and it's just about the perfect bag.Reading from the material that came with the bag:\"\"Features:*External SpeedPocket secures cell phones, wallet and keys for easy access*Internal Power Pocket holds bulky power cords, book and other accessories*Inside accessory pockets organize a USB, portable mouse, iPod and pens*Document compartment fits file folders or magazines*Luggage strap securely attaches messenger bag to most rolling luggage\"\"One nice feature is that the compartment for the laptop is on one side of the bag, and then areas for files, notebooks, and other sundries is on the other side.  The laptop compartment is accessed by a zipper that goes down 3 or so inches on either side..i.e. it doesn't zip all the way open so that the laptop slides down in.  Then, the other side has roomy areas for files, a zipper compartment (about 7\"\" x 12\"\") where you can store pens, keys, credit cards, money, etc., and everything on that side of the bag is covered by a flap that secures at the bottom with a hook-type closure.  This closure doesn't close tightly like a snap would, but I actually prefer it because I don't have to wrestle with a snap.  I it should come loose, I believe the structure of the bag and the weight of the flap would hold it pretty much in place...and the zipper compartment would be closed to avoid spilling anything.  The flap also contains another zipper compartment on its front for really easy access without having to access areas under the flap.  Also on the back is the luggage strap with a velcro closure.  Overall, the bag seems to be well-padded to protect the contents.The only negative is very small, but I don't like the fact that the shoulder strap (if used) has metal and plastic parts, which makes me worry that the plastic could fail/break at some point, since a rather heavy laptop is being carried, along with other items.  I will most likely not use the strap at any point, but I think a re-design would be in order, as this really is a very nice and useful bag. (I did feel I needed to score a 4 for durability for this reason.)\"", "\"I like the look of this bag, and use it as my new work bag, taking my laptop to/fro and my daily papers.  There isn't a lot of space in the bag, though -- I mean, it's rather narrow from front to back, so I have difficulty fitting much more than a couple thin books and my laptop in it.  For those who were wondering, considering it's flap front, it is NOT a messenger bag, but rather a fairly stylish, slim, yough'ish looking laptop bag.Pros:* It fits all my 3 laptops (13.3\"\", 15\"\", 17\"\") with ease (separately), and with reasonable padding.* It's fairly stylish -- more on the younger person style than and older more staid person's.* Easy access to zippered pockets, including the one on the front which is surprisingly well placedCons:* Too thin from front to back -- it's not very forgiving, and doesn't fit larger objects with any reasonable width.* The front flap, after a couple weeks of normal wear, is starting to butterfly out, as if the plastic / cardboard lining is out of whack* While stylish, it isn't really \"\"professional\"\" looking enough to use it if you're going to take your laptop with  you on a business trip where you'll be running into clients (in my opinion).* I fear the clap which buckles the front flap to the body of the bag will eventually stretch out the nylon belt it grasps on to.* It's wide -- I'm 6'1\"\" and a pretty big guy, and this definitely goes fully across my back.  It might be too big for some people's preference.  IT took a little getting used to in my case.On the whole, a good bag, but given the option again, I think I would choose something else.\""], "A": [0.11734242737293243, 2.5480403564870358e-05, 0.2890746295452118, 0.296269029378891, 0.1477610170841217, 2.39822884395835e-06, 0.14604097604751587, 0.0028355997055768967, 1.5609636250246695e-08, 0.00010882245260290802, 8.823070675134659e-05, 0.0004514007596299052, 7.440841831574119e-10]}
