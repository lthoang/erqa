{"reviews": ["I have most of my peripherals from Logitech and have been a great fan of theirs from the first product I have bought which was a Harmony One remote -Logitech Harmony One Universal Remote with Color Touchscreen! Also have the Google TV / Logitech Revue -Logitech Revue Companion Box with Google TV and Keyboard Controller!This was bought for a new desktop computer that I built recently, also bought a Logitech mouse -Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macand a webcam, from them -Logitech 1080p Webcam Pro C910 with Skype HD. All of these haven't failed me yet and their customer support - when I had to contact them once regarding the Revue was pretty great too!Okay moving on to the Keyboard -Logitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard K800! Even though I'm a great fan of Logitech products I in no ways was limiting my search for a wireless illuminated keyboard to Logitech alone! I was in the market with a specific need - Wireless and Back-lit keyboard - I searched high and low for one all over the net and even posted in forums asking people what they used or suggested! It so happens that there is not a lot of manufacturers who make such a keyboard - wireless and back-lit - mostly because the back lighting on the keyboard keys, tend to consume a lot of power and thereby drains the battery, so it has to be a wired keyboard to provide an unlimited energy source for the back lighting!Logitech however developed one which solved that problem by building in what they call a hand sensor, which means that the key will be lit only if it senses a movement (preferably your hand, ha ha) close to it! Hence the led lighting does not drain the power of the battery when not in use - this is very innovative and with that innovation Logitech filled an existing void in the market! That is one of the main reasons why I'm a fan!So as of now they are the only reputed manufacturer who make such a keyboard which has back lit keys, is wireless and has a great battery life to boot! Problem solved for me and that is where my search ended! So that is the the reason why I bought this keyboard!So if you are in the market for a wireless back-lit keyboard you would, right now, invariably end up with the K800!The keyboard works great and looks amazing, detailed review below -1) Functionality: The back-lit keys and the hand sensor works amazingly well, and does what it is supposed to do! The keys itself is nothing to brag about, they are bit stiff to the touch but does give you some feedback when you click it - I still like the feel of my work keyboard, which is a plain vanilla dell wired keyboard - better, for the simple reason that the keys are more elevated and you can definitely feel the key being pressed!2) Aesthetics: The keyboard looks awesome, especially in a dark or dim lit room like where I have my desktop! The hand sensor switches the led on and off as it senses the proximity of your hand, all you need to do is wave in front of it if you need to see the letters and numbers when its dark around! Build quality is awesome as expected from a Logitech product, it is pretty thin all round as there are no battery compartments, that helped to reduce the thickness a lot, I would assume!3) Battery Life: I have been using it non stop for the last week, I haven't shut down my system for a long duration continuously for the last 2 weeks and the keyboard is still live and well. It hasn't died yet! So I'm pretty happy with it and also it has a rechargeable battery - recharged through a USB cable provided! I haven't used it yet though!4) Ease of Setup:  If you had a wireless keyboard before you know how easy this is, just plug in the unifying receiver and you are all set, Windows did the rest automatically, sorry don't know how that would work on an Apple but I don't think it would be too different! If you are using an existing system this should work as soon as you plug the receiver in, if you have a newly build system, sometimes you might have to update the drivers of the motherboard to get the USB to work as it should!5) Unifying Receiver: One neat thing about having multiple Logitech peripherals is the Unifying receiver, which means that all your wireless devices and connected using a single receiver and you don't block multiple USB ports with all the receivers! For me I have a mouse and keyboard connected via one single USB receiver!6) Wireless Connection: I haven't ventured too far from the receiver as both my monitor and tower is in the same place, I have just pushed the chair back and used the keyboard from my lap mostly, and it works great! But if you have the monitor and tower separated for some reason, you might want to use the receiver extender cable provided along with it to give you some extra wiggle room!7) Durability: I have only been using it for the past month or so, so would hold off on commenting about this, it has so far proved to be extremely reliable and durable!8) Price: A very important consideration in my buying decision especially since you can get a Keyboard/Mouse combo for under $20, spending $70 on a keyboard alone was excessive, but of course they charge a premium for the innovation but customers like me who are looking for such a product is out of options. I wish someone would develop a similar product and give them some much needed competition and give me an option to choose from, at least a subset of 2 brands would be nice!So there you have it, rated it 5 stars, because the only crib I had was about the keystroke feedback quality, which is not bad at all, but just not the greatest I have seen, that does not IMHO deserve to lower the rating! Neither does the high cost, because this is the only product in this sub category, so I don't have a realistic price comparison, and even with the extra dollars spend, I'm happy with the overall value!", "This keyboard is extremely to type on especially when compared to my current logitech mk700. This keyboard is also considerably quieter when typing. In addition it is backlit with 2 built sensors. One sensor adjusts the backlit according the rooms lighting and the other wakes up the keyboard due to the proximity of your hand. I recently purchased logitechs k810 Bluetooth which had all these features and just loved them so I decided to purchase this one for my laptop. I use the Bluetooth one with my iPad Air and Apple TV 2. I haven't got a chance to test out the battery life yet. I'm sure it will be much less then my mk700. This keyboard can be charged via USB or you can remove the rechargeable NIMH batteries and replace them with any AA batteries. If you replace the batteries then you won't be able to charge the keyboard. Also once the batteries are removed I believe the warranty is void, at least that's what I've read from other reviews. The keyboard can also be used while being charged, although you cannot connect this keyboard through a wired connection. It has to be connect wireless via the unified receiver. That's another great feature of this keyboard since it uses the unified receiver you can connect up to 6 logitech wireless devices with just one USB port. Overall great keyboard. I do wish the battery life was rated higher. Also it would nice to get a full size keyboard just like this but that connected via Bluetooth with no need for a USB dongle. The k810 is Bluetooth with similar features  than this one but smaller and doesn't as much short cut keys. Got this keyboard for $60 and I think that's a very fair price. Anything more is just too expensive for a desktop keyboard. Considering you can get the higher end mk710 keyboard and mouse combo for $70.", "Pros:1-Keys are perfect silent and smooth very natural2-Lighting in the keys is perfect cannot be better than that.3-capslock lights up green when pressed in k400 they had no sign.4-battery lasts almost a week with minor usage like 3-4 hours a day5-Light sensors does the job amazingly perfect.6-It's design is perfect love that bezel and smooth surface.Cons:1-It's heavy damn heavy you cannot hold it in one hand for more than 30 seconds.2-I heard if it's keys breaks there is no easy way fixing that.3-I will advice shipper to use lasership company for shipping my landlord kept this keyboard for long time and ups told me they left the package at door.(Lasership company delivers to your door)Update:This keyboards range is limited to 4-6 feet it looses signal after that and misses letters typed but that usb extension for dongle really worked.", "There isn't much of anything wrong with this keyboard.  It does what it is supposed to do.  The battery life is decent and charging is easy.  The wireless connection is a no brainer.  Easy to use.", "Has anyone been able to successfully connect this keyboard to a Sony Wi-Fi enabled Blu-Ray player?  I was able to connect and use a standard (wired USB) keyboard via the USB port in my BDP-S390.I am wondering if anyone has been able to use the Logitech (or similar) wireless keyboard with a Sony BDP-S390 or compatible player.  Since wireless keyboards require software drivers, I suspect this may prevent me from using a wireless device.Thanks in-advance for your help!", "I am a computer programmer and as someone who uses the computer all day and another 3+ hours when I get home (checking emails and online game playing), I can tell you that this keyboard is one of the best keyboards I've used. Very comfortable and key press pressure is good with a good feedback. The wrist pad is good and I like the fact the keyboard is thin. I also like that when the keyboard needs recharging, I can just plug the mini USB cable in and it does not effect my typing whatsoever. The back lighting is good although I have to admit that once I notice the back lighting is when I turn on the room lights. I can imagine that it would be good if the computer was in your bedroom and you had to keep the lights off or dim for your spouse. Overall, very please with this purchase.", "This keyboard is everything I had hoped it would be when I ordered it.  It is worth every penny.  One concern when buying a $90 (after tax) keyboard is whether or not you're actually getting what you're paying for and whether it will actually be that much better than a less expensive model.  Now that I have it, I feel like I got a bargain.I was concerned at first that I was paying for illumination and for the wireless aspect, and that the keyboard itself would just be a slight improvement over something like the k400.  Not the case at all.  Everything is premium on this keyboard.  The typing experience is great.  It's sized properly.  All around well done.Highly recommend.  There are other great keyboards, and maybe one of those better suits your needs.  But if you know what you need, and the product features have put this on your short list, or maybe its the only thing on your list, then the only thing stopping you may be questions about the implementation of those features.  They are implemented perfectly.  Worth every penny and then some.Oh, and if you see that it isn't the newest product out there, forget about that.  Ask yourself, what part of this product would be better in a newer model?  It's not relying on changing technology.  It's not like monitors, hard drives, etc where there are constant improvements, advances, and changes.  Once you've got it wireless, and illuminated, and made of modern material, then it's more about how well it's crafted than anything else.  The feel of the keys.  The ergonomics.  The size.  Those things haven't changed, and don't seem to be on the verge of changing anytime soon.", "I frequently use my computer late at night. I do keep my lights on but the only reason is so that I can see the keyboard. I really wished I didn't have to, hence looking into an illuminated keyboard. There are some in $20 - $30 range, but this one is worth the price because:1. Slick design and attention to detail such as clear trim.2. Overall look clean and polished, feel like an $80 keyboard3. Illumination of keys are clean, bright but soft, and can dim slowly and elegantly4. Wireless (see below)5. Re-chargeableWireless feature allow me to unplug the USB adapter from my desktop and plug it into my HTPC and allow me to use computer on a big home theater screen.The laptop feel keyboard is easy to type. However, for a full size keyboard I would rather see it deeper, perhaps between the depth of regular keyboard and laptop.I have not tested the battery life of this yet as I don't expect to go several hours without charging.", "This keyboard is simply amazing. I use it in my small living room closet home office with my 11 years old Dell XPS Desktop. The backlit is bright and has some kind of built-in intetelisense: it senses your fingers approaching and lights up and turns off as soon as you take your fingers away. Very smart engineering indeed.I have used it frequently for over three weeks now and the battery is still showing full charge. I understand it uses Sanyo Eneloop Rechargeable battery just like theLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac. This means that you can swap the battery when and if it ever stop holding charges through the lifespan of the keyboard.Setup is as easy as downloading or installing (from enclosed CD) the logitech setpoint software and subsequently pluging and pairing with the unifying receiver. Bear in mind that you can only pair one device to one unifying receiver at a time. This means you cannot pair the keyboard or mouse with the receiver on your desktop and also pair the same keyboard or mouse to a different receiver on your laptop. If you do this you will receiver pairing error. You first need to unpair the keyboard or mouse from the receiver on your desktop before attempting to pair it with the receiver on your laptop. You can of course simply transfer the receiver from your desktop to your laptop. The keyboard will only recognise the last receiver you paired it with. I am using the same unifying receiver on my desktop for both the K800 and MX Performance Mouse: a delightful combo for sure.The look and feel of this keyboard is pretty much like laptops. It is thin and has a small wrist rest that may make additional wrist pad superflous for some people. I am not sure about its durability but trust Logitech's craftmanship. I am loving it and would not hesitate to purchase another one if it breaks down.", "Love the keyboard. Not sure how to describe it but the feedback from the keys feels really good. Some keyboards feel cheap and flimsy. The keys on this one feel solid but not too hard to press. Also, love that it light up when you place your hands over it.", "\"I'm typing this review on it right now. Sitting on the couch, with the laptop over by the TV, and the matching trackball mouse next to me, using my 60\"\" TV for a monitor, with the keyboard on my lap. Haven't had it long enough to drain the batteries yet(about a week).It still shows full charge. The keys are smooth as glass, very quiet, with a very positive \"\"click\"\"(felt) to let you know you hit it enough. The \"\"calculator\"\" hot key is cool, nice to have that at the press of a button. And it's WAY cool to have it light up just before your hand gets there. There's nothing I don't like about it so far. The USB extender for the receiver is great, it lets me dangle it in front of the TV base for much smoother mouse function.(my TV stand occludes the receiver if I leave it in the computer) But it will work from 20' away no problem if nothing's in the way. All around nice, well made piece. I'll see if I need to do that battery upgrade down the road, but it's all good so far.10/24/13 Update:Haven't had to charge it yet, still shows \"\"full\"\" when you mouse over the icon.I don't use it more than an hour or so each night, though more lately since I've been playing pinball, which is almost constant use. I'll post again when it finally needs charging.\"", "12-17-2012a (third update)This is a very nice full sized, wireless keyboard ....The back lighting is blue-white, but not obnoxiously so (I hate blue LED's).Read below, why I marked it as, only 3 stars...Pros:Full sizedEasy to see night or dayConfigurableCan be sued with the USB cable connectedHot keys to music player, email whateverinteroperable (unifying) with SOME of their mice (not the M305 = minus one star))The key board USB dongle seems to be OK, with the mouse dongle right next to it (no interference)Cons:Mine was missing the micro-USB wire used for charging (uses same one as my DX2), they wanted me to go through hoops, just to get one, or I had to buy a new one = Minus 1 starList price high, I paid about 1/3 lessOccasionally wont turn on. Power switch kinda flaky. Solution: Turn off than back on, all the way to the right (once it malfunctions, it wont again, for many days.  MeThinks its software).Intermittent keyboard stutter (it hits the same key 3 or 4 times).  Same as above, cycled the power.  One more thing like this and I'm gonna return it...Nice key board, customer support kinda sux...", "This keyboard has a very nice feel however I use a KVM for my computer setup and the wireless adapter didn't work with my KVM.  Also this keyboard is very bulky.  Please note that I am huge Apple fan and I appreciate minimalist and sleek hardware.  I gave this keyboard a shot to see if it would be more comfortable that my Apple keyboard.  Also this keyboard is louder that the manufacturer advertises.", "I think that this is a great keyboard for the price. Its not full of features as a gaming keyboard but serves its purpose nicely", "\"I admit that what made me buy this keyboard was all the positive reviews from my fellow Amazon reviewers.  Almost everything they said was spot-on. I usually like to buy my keyboards from the stores because I want to tap and type and touch / feel it before committing to a particular keyboard. There's nothing worse than buying a keyboard that you absolutely hate typing on. But, I bought this keyboard with no previous touching or typing and it worked out great.The unit is sleek, well-proportioned, and very functional. All the function keys are where they are in a traditional keyboard. No more having to \"\"get used\"\" to the special placement of some function keys like on other keyboards. The illumination function on the keyboard is kind of neat and probably would be really helpful if you're typing at night and don't want to bother people around you with a desk light. I don't tend to use it much because I'm in an office environment where there's always above the head lightening. There's an easy light strength adjustment on the keyboard itself (FN+F5 to reduce the illumination and FN+F6 to increase the illumination). The keyboard also has a built-in sensor that senses when you hands near the keyboard and the illumination pops on. After using the keyboard for a few days now, I've discovered that the illumination kind of turns on and off by itself. Maybe my lightening conditions (office fluorescents) aren't ideal but it doesn't really bother me at all so I don't consider it a deal-breaker.There's also built in shortcut keys that you can program the F1, F2, etc buttons with. All the keys are standard size. I don't like it when keyboards try to be different and shorten the space bar to make the enter button smaller. The big thing that makes me love this keyboard are the KEYS ... they are shaped like little chiclets (those gum / candy pieces supermarkets sell) and they have just the right tension and give to make typing fast and accurate. These \"\"chiclet\"\" keys are also low-profile so it creates a pretty flat surface for your fingers to fly over. I actually think I type faster on this keyboard than my old Logitech MK300 keyboard because of the \"\"chiclet\"\" keys. Also, this keyboard is one of the quietest keyboards I've ever used. My co-worker sitting 6' from me can't hear me banging on my keyboard anymore (but I can hear her on her keyboard).I like that there's an ON / OFF button near the top of the number pad. I don't know if I like the fact that it comes with rechargeable batteries that you \"\"recharge\"\" by plugging in the provided usb cable charger into an available usb port on your computer. (You can remove the rechargeable batteries (secured in a screwed compartment) and replace them with traditional batteries.) This means you sort of have to constantly watch out for the charge level on your keyboard. In the instruction manual, it tells you what the green indicator lights (next to the the ON / OFF button) mean. Full charge is 3 GREEN lights, 2/3 charge is 2 GREEN lights, etc). The manual also says that the keyboard will take about 5 hrs to fully charge on \"\"empty\"\" with power button \"\"ON\"\" while it only takes 3 hrs to fully charge with the power button on OFF.  I've haven't tried this yet so I can't really say. I'm sure recharging depends on how you use the keyboard also.This keyboard comes with Logitech's Unifying Receiver USB technology where one receiver can be used with up to 6 Logitech devices. No more bulky mouse / keyboard receiver sitting on your desk staring at you all day. This thumbnail size receiver is simply put in an available usb port in your computer. You download / load the Logitech Set Point software (either from CD-ROM or their website) and the software walks you through connecting each Logitech product from mice to keyboards to speakers. Within the Logitech Set Point software, there are tabs of the different Logitech products that you are currently connected to and you just press the tab to specifically setup your mouse, keyboard, etc. Quite convenient and makes it easier to find all your devices.The only bad thing I can say about this keyboard (and again, not a deal-breaker) is that there is a surrounding area of shiny black glossy plastic material that circles the main QWERTY area on the keyboard and if your fingers touch it, you'll leave smudge marks or fingerprints. It's just the nature of the material they used on the area around the keys. Matte material would have been better. So, I find myself wiping down the area around the arrow keys a lot because my fingers sometimes touch the glossy areas smudging the area.  Other than that, this keyboard is pretty darn great.\"", "I have owned three other wireless keyboards before this one and none could compare to the Logitech K-800.. The feedback from the keys is perfect for me and I love the back lit keys. The battery lasts for about a week per charge. I have used the keyboard for a couple of weeks now and can find no fault with it. I highly recommend this product.", "This keyboard is the cat's meow. I don't know how I got along with the others. Just turned it on and it paired up with my other Logitech devices. Just put your hand near it and it lights right up. Or, keep it plugged in and it stays lit up.", "My son needed a new keyboard, so without question, I ordered one of these because I enjoy mine so much.PRO:A.  WirelessB.  IlluminatedC.  Long battery life, (Same batteries used for two years)CON:A.  Still expensive for a keyboard.B.  It's just a keyboard, it needs some cool features, like a digital clock, or color change feature, or smell like bacon.", "I bought this keyboard especially for my grandson.  He is an avid gamer and loves the features of this keyboard.", "I have 30 years computer experience and have gotten used to buying new keyboards every 6 months over the years.  Happy to report I have been using this wireless keyboard now for 2 years and its still working fine.  I did have to take the screw out and change the rechargable batteries after about a years usauge.... was happy to find out that it has two rechargeble AA batteries in it so now am back in business. Never had a keyboard last this long before so it softens the blow of how pricey it is.  I think its worth the money.  Am thinking of buying another just in case this one dies on me.  So far so good. Works on Linux too.", "This keyboard is a 'step up' from my former wireless keyboard -- also a Logitech:Logitech Cordless Desktop S510. While my old keyboard was nice, the K800 offered a number of significant improvements, including an illuminated keyboard and a built-in rechargeable battery. It's also compatible with the Logitech Unifying Receiver, which operates on the 2.4GHz frequency for great range and performance. Bottom line -- I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD. For more details, see below:>>SETUP&lt;&lt; -- Getting this keyboard up and running was a snap. I just took it out of the box, inserted the Unifying Receiver, a teeny-tiny little USB device, into my desktop, and turned the keyboard on. The entire operation, from bringing the box inside my house to actively using the keyboard, took around a minute. This keyboard is truly plug-and-play.>>APPEARANCE&lt;&lt; -- This keyboard is sleek and stylish. The all-black coloring and use of both matte- and glossy-black finish is a tasteful design choice. This keyboard, like my old one, has a slim profile... very modern and 'clean' looking. The backlit keys are amazing! This is definitely a feature I will enjoy. It's nice to be able to see the keys at night without having to have the lights on; not only does it cut down on electricity, but it lets you do work at night without having to keep the house lit up while others are trying to sleep. Plus, if you're into gaming, it lets you get 'in the zone' with the monitor as the sole light source (besides the keyboard).>>PERFORMANCE / FUNCTIONALITY&lt;&lt; -- Again, this keyboard is a step up from my old one in every way. The illuminated keys (which have 4 brightness settings plus an 'always off' setting) are very nice. The programmable function keys are a bonus, but I don't typically use those. The keyboard layout is pretty much the standard, and should be intuitive for those with even a basic level of computer experience. The key spacing and proportions are good; I have large hands, my girlfriend has small hands, and we both love the keyboard. Keystrokes are smooth and QUIET, making even less sound that my old keyboard, which was already pretty quiet. The feel is that of a very nice, solid laptop keyboard... only a bit larger, and without the Laptop.>>WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY&lt;&lt; --  The 2.4GHz receiver with Logitech 'Unifying' technology is awesome. Truly plug-and-play. As an added bonus, the range is FAR superior to that of my old keyboard. I can sit at the table in my dining room, eating a meal or playing cards or another game with my friends, and use my keyboard to shuffle through a playlist on the computer in my office 30 feet away, behind a wall. The extended range of the 2.4GHz unifying receiver is something users of this keyboard will definitely enjoy.>>RECHARGING&lt;&lt; -- The recharging feature is great; no more worries about popping out batteries. I useSANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesfor my devices, and a pair of AAAs in my old keyboard would last a couple months. Not bad, but it's even nicer to NEVER have to worry about batteries. The 10-day life is fine for me; recharging is as simple as plugging in a micro-USB cable to the back of the keyboard. You can do this while using the keyboard, or leave it charging overnight. Having the keyboard plugged in every week or so for a few hours, to me, is well worth the tradeoff of its light weight, illuminated keys, and excellent wireless range. NOTE that while the keyboard package includes a USB charging cord, you can use any old micro-usb charger plugged into a wall socket / power strip just as easily. Personally, I have two micro-usb charging cords plugged into my office power strip, and have them threaded through the little hole at the base of my monitor stand. I use these to charge wireless headphones, my cell phone, the K800 keyboard, bluetooth headset, etc. Very convenient, very cheap. You can find them for around a dollar on any web retail site, Amazon included.>>SUMMARY&lt;&lt; -- what's left to say? I really, really like this keyboard. At around eighty bucks, it's a considerable pricetag for something as 'basic' as a keyboard, but take it from me: you will like this keyboard. The feel and layout are comfortable and sleek. The performance is great. The design / appearance is clean and modern. The recharging and illumination are key features you never knew you needed or wanted until you sit down and type with this keyboard. Bottom line: I enthusiastically recommend this keyboard to any and all users who may even occasionally wish to make use of the functionality of a wireless keyboard.", "I've had this keyboard for over a year and it has surpassed my expectations in every way. It was easy to set up with my logitech mouse using one receiver, so no wires on my desk. I love the way it lights up only when I touch it. The battery is very good. I have only charged it twice! It has a nice touch and is quiet. As I get older I find that I really like (and need) the extra visibility of a backlit keyboard. Do yourself a favor and get one.", "I wanted a wireless keyboard and this one comes highly recommended - it works well.  Need to be recharged once a month but this is easy to do overnight.  It is slightly less than full size", "I type in the dark quite a bit, so this backlit keyboard works wonders for me.  The default level of backlighting is just perfect, though it's also adjustable if you want it brighter or dimmer.  The keys have a very nice mechanical feel to them, and are just a pleasure to type on.  Setting it up was extremely easy, just plug the little USB receiver into the computer and it went through its setup routine automatically.  Took about 2 minutes.  then just start typing.  The backlight comes on automatically when you place your hands over the keyboard, and it goes off a few seconds after you remove them.It has an on/off switch, and I originally thought I'd need to turn it off when I wasn't using it.  This doesn't seem to be the case though, as I've had it on for several days now and the battery meter still shows it being fully charged (3 bars).  I probably use it for an hour or two a day.It's a bit expensive, but the cheaper backlit keyboards seemed to have weird key layouts, with various ancillary keys arranged in a non-standard layout.  This one is just perfect though, everything is in the standard place, and all the keys are the standard size.  Just like the keyboard that came with my computer.It also has volume up and down keys, as well as mute.  These work (I'm using Windows Vista), though for some reason you have to hold them down for a few seconds before the volume starts changing.  There's a big delay in there for some reason.  There's also a key that brings up the calculator, and that too seems to work though with a long delay.  You can download some software from the Logitech site which allows you to customize various things, like disabling certain keys that you don't use so you don't hit them accidentally and various other things.", "It charges via USB, but I have been using it for 6 weeks, and have yet to need to recharge it. I love that it's backlit, and the keys are quiet when pressed. This is the best keyboard I've ever owned.", "Simple last long works great and has a lot of helpful feats like illuminations and key commands! by this if you want to go wireless right!", "I never thought I would call a keyboard beautiful, but this has to be one of the nicest looking ones I've seen. I wasn't expecting much, as I generally use ergonomic keyboards for comfort, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the look and feel of this keyboard. It is thin and black, with backlit keys, and it has a built-in battery which can be charged via a micro-USB port. There is a separate numeric keypad for number-crunching, and the key layout is standard with no major surprises.What I really liked was the smooth feel while typing. The closest I would compare this to is the Macbook keyboard. I was able to type quickly and accurately. The wireless connection was seamless, and with all recent Logitech wireless products, the USB receiver which is plugged into the computer is just a tiny nub and very unobtrusive. I also use a wireless Logitech mouse, and a very neat thing is that with one USB receiver, you can connect both the mouse and keyboard, which is great if you don't have many USB ports to spare.There are only a couple of downsides that I could find. First, the num lock key doesn't have an indicator light, so you don't know if it's on or off. Second, it's a fairly compact non-ergonomic keyboard, so your hands may begin to feel cramped after many hours of typing. Overall, though, it's another really polished Logitech product. I'm a big fan of theirs.", "I was hesitant to buy this after returning a different wireless keyboard by logitech, but so far I am happy with it, only used it for a few days so far but I personally like being able to recharge it after using so many wireless keyboards over the years that ran out of charge and once required me to go to the store to get more. I wouldn't use this for gaming, but being wireless it cleans up my desk a little bit. Time will tell how well it holds up but I would like it to last.", "Okay---for me this keyboard is just the best of all........The one and only complaint I have is not about the keyboard itself ---but about the mouse situation. It needs a mouse---wireless preferable.....they make some to go with this ..but either Logitech wants to  assume you know this or simply forgot to tell you that you need it.You MUST have a mouse ...... So NO mouse is a problem !!!!! Especially if you order this or travel to a store for it and get home all ready to surf ---only to find out that you CANNOT !!!!....becaue you have NO MOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!!! Since this is made for laptops---the mouse needs should be clearly mentioned on the box and in the ads.Getting back to the keyboard itself...let me count the praises down for you.1. Backlite keyboard. The laptop I hooked this up to is in my bedroom. I have several computers--but the one in my bedroom is the only one that I will be using in low light or no light because I pretty much only use it at night.What a excellent thing it is to be able to ACTUALLY SEE the keyboard. A wave of the hand will regenerate the light if it goes off ..which it will do as a engery saver.2. Did I say WIRELESS !!3. Ease of use. How easy can it be ? Simply insert wireless connection plug into your laptop and you are good to go !!....and if you get their brand mouse --so will it be ready as well.4. Keyboard keeps its charge for a long time..need to charge it up ??  You are only a cord (USB) away.5. Feel of the Keys  ! Soft , inviting , come hither keys. I cannot stop wanting to caress them.6. JOY OF USE------  100 %  !!!!!!", "Everything about this keyboard is AMAZING! I love it, everything about it, it's sooooo cool! wireless, lights up, feels great, and uses the same usb nub as my mouse :)", "This is a fabulous LIGHTED keyboard.  I tend to work late into the night at home so lighting is not always the best.  Having already had eye surgery for cataracks, my night vision is not what it used to be.  So I looked for a lighted keyboard.This keyboard is great and it is CORDLESS.  It has it's own battery that you occasionally charge through USB port and the battery is replaceable.  When the light is on the key letters are lit in white and are very clear to see as I am typing.  IF I stop typing, it will stay lit for about 10 seconds then dim down and go out.  Waving over the keyboard or touching a key will bring the light back on again.  Very nice.  The keyboard is almost the same as the OEM IBM keyboard so you won't have any problem getting comfortable with it.  If you need to be sure the keyboard layout is what you need, look at the pictures and check it out.  I am happy with this wireless keyboard and would recommend it.  140412", "Great wireless keyboard, rechargeable and illuminated.  The keys are very quiet even with my heavy pounding hands.  Must be from all those years on a manual typewriter LOL......I can't really think of any &#34;cons&#34; with this unit:  As this is a different configuration than it is from my last keyboard, I was making some mistakes, but that was easily remedied by time:  Some of the keys were different in size, but a couple hours and I was as comfortable on it as I was my old one ;))This connects as a plug and play:  All you have to do is plug in the nano receiver and you're set.  I HIGHLY recommend going to Logitech.com and downloading their SetPoint software so that you can customize the speed of the cursor, the sensitivity, etc."], "A": [1.9065049018662794e-12, 6.147072264011122e-19, 5.379091817303561e-06, 0.17479190230369568, 9.105525222707911e-09, 3.53152154275449e-06, 2.5572328976597447e-11, 0.0020462998654693365, 5.105255194287617e-12, 0.001212604227475822, 6.29396870992921e-13, 1.3459857685881038e-13, 0.17724980413913727, 0.1683356761932373, 3.3309401352064453e-28, 0.00010396735888207331, 2.9994579736625226e-11, 0.17276106774806976, 0.16847971081733704, 2.607811779853364e-07, 9.78994524336585e-11, 1.13493424578337e-05, 0.07934798300266266, 6.321557374372114e-24, 5.6649816542631015e-05, 0.035078082233667374, 1.7755604602702747e-27, 0.0003844472812488675, 0.0033282351214438677, 5.8239587815478444e-05, 0.0020472232718020678, 0.014697635546326637]}
