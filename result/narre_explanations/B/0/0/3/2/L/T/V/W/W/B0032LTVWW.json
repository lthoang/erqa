{"reviews": ["Know what you get, and what you don't.NO ROMANCE / NO DLC USAGE / NO REPLAYABILITYTo date, I've invested more than 150 hours in Dragon Age. I bought all the DLC. For me, all Bioware games are Must-Play. But I can't make the argument that Awakening is Must-Own. It all depends on what you care about. Bioware games work on four pillars. Story World. Level-up System. Romance. Replayability. Awakening has two of the four. By 25% more Dragon Age, I expect to get 35 hours out of Awakening. Three play throughs, about 12 hours each. Warrior, mage, thief. I don't count that at as full replayability. I expect to get 6-8 play throughs for a Bioware game. Awakening doesn't let you use any of your DLC. Awakening has no romance. No old romance. No new romance. With no romance and no dlc and no full replayability, I consider Awakening 50% of a Bioware experience.5-STAR BIOWARE STORYTELLING / LEVEL-UP TO 35The same writers, the same artists, the same level of excellence. If you understand what you're getting, Awakening is easy to love. New quests are fun. Meeting new characters are fun. It's bittersweet that you don't get to continue with your old companions, but that's part of the emotional experience. You have to imagine making leather-bikini love to Morigan in that secret part of your mind while you're splattering fresh darkspawn blood. Or you can treat this mission as optional, and never make the trip. It's your Fantasy. You don't have to play it. You don't have to buy it. You don't have to give Bioware your money.FOR ME, IT'S A MUST-PLAY. FOR WHAT IT IS, IT'S AWESOME.", "\"Dragon Age: Originswas a real treat for me. I was absolutely absorbed by the lore Bioware created for it, and instantly fell in love with the characters with whom I eventually traveled Ferelden. On the whole, I almost liked it BETTER than even MASS EFFECT 2, because I felt like I was playing out MY story, not Shepard's story. That's a feeling I've not had since KotOR. But, similarly to KotOR, the production values of DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS felt last generation, which hindered the experience in many ways.So, I was surprised to hear about this expansion so soon after the main game's release. I mean...when I first heard about this at the beginning of the year: barely two months after DA:O came out. I was concerned that this was just going to be a moneygrab by Bioware/EA, since...who has ever made an expansion that quickly? (Maybe EVERQUEST). Additionally, though Bioware have proven that they are the best at creating absorbing story/character-driven video games, they absolutely suck at DLC. (Pinnacle Station RAGE!)Is this expansion worth buying? That's difficult for me to say. Hopefully my experience will help you make up your mind.Chances are very good that this expansion will not snugly sync up with your ending from the main game. In my case, I had made it pretty clear to everyone that I was going to leave with Zevran to track down Morrigan. Then, I begin DA:O - AWAKENING to discover that I had apparently changed my mind and decided to become a commander of the Crown's army. A small scene to show how my character was drawn back into the fray would have solved this, but this is just one of many instances where your decisions from the last game have almost no effect on this storyline. (And to the poor souls who began the game wearing nothing but their underwear: my condolences.)This was a major downer, and I am very disappointed that Bioware didn't put a little more time (god knows Bioware fans are used to the long development cycles by now) to make the transition much easier. Don't even get me started on the import system. It's not as fine-tuned as that of MASS EFFECT 2; it takes data from your last save point. I had started up an old save at some point on DA:O, so I began AWAKENING with my character at level 17. It was an hour before I had realized what had happened. EDIT: Just so there's no confusion, I was able to open up an \"\"advanced\"\" menu and select the right save file, but words cannot communicate the frustration involved with immediately replaying that bit again.But that's not to say I hated this game; I enjoyed the story in AWAKENING and I REALLY enjoyed the new characters. At times, it felt like the best parts of DA:O. In addition to this, some new talents and specializations, a higher level cap and, finally, someplace to store equipment: I was a happy camper for a while. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to rule Amaranthine, and I wish that Bioware had expanded upon this a bit more. Carrying out prisoner sentencing in a fantasy setting has to be one of the coolest features ever.On \"\"normal\"\" difficulty, getting all (but one) of the achievements, and completing almost every quest in the game, I enjoyed just over 13 hours of gameplay.Was it worth $40? No, probably not. I think anyone who has reservations about this expansion should trust their instincts and wait for the price to drop. Bioware really should have taken the price down to justify the content, rather than place it at $40 and keep people like myself wondering why there isn't more. I don't exactly feel cheated, since I really did enjoy the expansion, but I paid just as much for the first 4 expansions of FALLOUT 3 and those actually felt like EXPANSIONS. DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS - AWAKENING feels like an episode: almost completely isolated from the last game in terms of both content and story.There is much that can be loved in this \"\"expansion\"\" for fans of DRAGON AGE, but this should be a very clear example to Bioware of why some gamers insist on buying their video games used.\"", "This expansion to Dragon Age Orgins, pales in size to the original game, but it nevertheless a good size expansion. The cost may be a little much at first release, but I did really enjoy playing the expansion. You start at a high level and get to fully utilize plenty of high level abilities, weapons and armor throughout the expansion. The stories, quests and characters are overall pretty good, as are the voice acting and graphics. There are a decent amount of choices for an expansion game and some detailed endings. I thought it was pretty well done and certainly worth playing for anyone who liked DA Orgins.", "It was quite a bit for the expansion pack, but still better than DA 2. The first part of the trilogy is a very well put-together game.", "For an expansion this game played more like a DLC. Not that it wasn't fun to expand on my player from origins and take the story further. I didn't have many problems with glitches but from what I understand there we're a lot of glitches. The story is anywhere from 12 to 15 hurse worth depending on if you do all the side quests or not. All in all it is worth the money to buy now than when it was just realesed.", "I am giving such a low rating for one reason. It is not worth $40 (what I paid). I LOVED DA:O. It is in my opinion hands down the best game of this genre that has been released since KOTOR. I actually like the story in Awakenings, I liked the skill upgrades etc. But seriously, I completed the entire thing in less than 10 hrs. DA:O took me just over 60 hours and it only cost $60. This expansion pack is a rip-off at around $40. Not to mention, I replayed DA:O at least 10 times...and I wanted to replay it. While the story is good in Awakenings, I would rate its replay value at around 2 out of 5.I know many will say to rate this so low based on price is unfair, but for overall value alone I would've give it less than 1 star....the story brings it back up a couple of notches. If I had it to do over again, I would wait several months and pick this up used for half or less than half the price and I would've been happy. There is just way too little content/story to this expansion pack to justify the cost.", "Man, these reviewers are harsh!  Stop freaking whining about all the little items you wanted to import from the last game (which will easily be replaced with new and more powerful stuff), quit crying about how you want to go look for Morrigan, and freaking play.If you do play, you'll find a great story, interesting new characters who are fun to use in combat, amazing battle situations, lots of new items, specializations, skills & abilities, and plenty of play time for your money.  The new enemy types are great--powerful and fast, the sub-quests are pretty cool, the loot is plentiful, and the art direction and creativity of the new environments, locations and such are, if anything, better than the original!People are complaining about the length-- when most games cost $50-$60 and give you about 6-9 hours of play time, I don't know what the problem is here.  With the ability to create a new character from scratch adding even more replay value (in addition to playing through with any/all your characters from the first game) what the heck is there to complain about?In short, go in with an open mind, and don't focus too much on a couple of character-importing details/glitches, and you will have a blast with this add-on.  I will say that having played this both with imported characters, and with a newly created one, it works MUCH better creating a new one.  The story makes much more sense, the process of equipping your character makes more sense (bringing in all that powerful stuff from your original game imbalances this one), the game is more challenging & balanced--things just click.I sincerely hope they keep churning these out, I'm happy to pay for more time with one of the best video games ever made...spoiler--->> the only bad news is that the finale of the game really seems to put the nail in the coffin of this tale, bringing everything to a close and basically letting you know that your character's adventures, and the threats to Ferelden seem to be over.  That makes me sad."], "A": [0.00027571662212722003, 2.9623393857036717e-05, 0.23756572604179382, 0.21928094327449799, 0.34362006187438965, 0.18596677482128143, 0.01326119713485241]}
