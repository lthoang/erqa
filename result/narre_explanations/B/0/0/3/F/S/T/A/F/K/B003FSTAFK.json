{"reviews": ["Generally I cannot compare this with a built-in model in one vehicle, but it serves a perfect portable addition to the other vehicles.  Most likely, the biggest downside is that the screen could be larger than the 4 inches.  Plus, I would have preferred an easy way to attach without gluing anything to the dash.  I have moved this to two different vehicles and need to buy a suction holder.The screen is easy to read, but I cannot read it from the dash.  So, I carry it by my side.  The voice is nice and clear, and the menu page is easy to navigate.  Advancing the screen map by touch proves a little challenging.  Some of the features I enjoy are the Advance Lane guide which I use frequently.  I also like the time to arrive, mileage, etc., but the font is very small.  I have not used the Help Me feature, but this appears to guide to important locations such as hospitals, police, etc.  For an extra feature, you can select online different cartoon voices.What I like is the lifetime updates.  The points of interest feature is accessable, but I have not had the need yet.  Planning a route is easy and I have chosen the female voice and one can go online for help, plus more cartoon features if you like.Since I carry this between two vehicles that are used frequently, I like the nice compact case the navigator comes.  Everything neatly stored for transporting to other vehicles......Rizzo", "\"This is a personal opinion of theTomTom XL 350 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator.As a stand-alone GPS navigator, this unit is decent and informative, and the front-end conclusion is that it works.  For my purposes, I don't need Bluetooth capability, I don't need to view pictures or play mp3 songs on it, I do not need the elevation feature.  I just need it to help me get from A to B.  Having had experience with another TomTom GPS unit (XL 340TM) and a Garmin Nuvi 255W, I've made direct comparisons with these units.  This review and the comparisons I posted here are, of course, subjective, though I tried to be as objective as possible.For all intents and purpose, the TomTom 340 and 350 are almost identical in design and function, with some minor differences.  Tracking the satellite signal at startup, the 340 picked up signal faster than the 350, the time difference varied from a few seconds to half a minute lag for the 350.  When I plan the same destination for both units, the 350 took longer to route, taking from a few seconds to half a minute longer.  When I drove around with both the 340 and the 350 side-by-side, they gave the exact same directions and the audio prompts were nearly identical (there were some 1 second lags between the two units, but mostly the same).  When I deviated from the planned route, the reroute calculation took almost the exact same time, though the 350 lagged by at least a second (or more) 85% of the time.  The 350 has a 2D/3D toggle button, which allows you to switch the map view.  However, the 2D view only shows a North-up map and does not give you an option of having the map rotate/orient to the direction of the car.The routing gives you the primary route, and then an alternate route.  That's it.  I was hoping for a third option (shortest route), but not with this unit.  Not a big deal, but can be an issue if that is a required/requested feature for a prospective buyer.If the nomenclature is supposed to follow tradition, I would expect the 350 to be the newer and \"\"better\"\" unit.  I will have to disagree with this.  About 80% of the functionality is similar to the 340, but a few of the differences make the 350 inferior to the 340.The bottom line is that if I had no prior experience with a GPS navigation device, I would say the TomTom 350 would be a very good/excellent device.  It gets you from point A to point B with minimal frills (no Bluetooth capability, no pictures, cannot play mp3 music, no traffic updates).  Therefore, it is a decent stand-alone GPS navigation unit.  However, having made a direct comparison with other devices, I cannot say this device will be my top choice.Other features are described below:The input is easy (qwerty keyboard), and the touch screen is sensitive enough that I don't need to press into the unit.  The mount is easy to put on the bottom left corner of the windshield, and the unit is also easy to put on the mount.Direct Comparison:  TomTom 350 vs Garmin Nuvi 255WNote:  After doing a side-by-side comparison of the TomTom 340TM vs TomTom 350, I am comfortable making the statement that the two are 95% identical in function (mapping, routing, POIs).  Because the 340TM has lifetime map upgrades AND a traffic receiver, I will give an additional edge to the 340TM over the 350.  For the rest of the review (comparison against the Nuvi 255), I will say that the 340 and the 350 are identical.When compared to a Garmin Nuvi 255W, there are a few noticeable features that either excel or lack.  On the TomTom XL 350, I like that all the information is on the screen (map, current speed AND posted speed limit, current time, time of arrival, distance left to destination, distance to next turn, and traffic along current path).  The device also warns me if I have exceded the posted speed limit by making the speed limit RED.  These may either make or break the deal, since these are purely subjective features.  The TomTom features are similar to what is available to the Toyota cars with built-in GPS.  For the interface layout, I will give TomTom the edge.  (TomTom up one)I followed the same routes that I used for the \"\"TomTom 340 vs Garmin Nuvi 255W\"\" challenge in the streets of San Francisco (which I posted on the TomTom 340TM product review).  I started in the South of Market area (near downtown) and put in a destination way across the city (Ocean Beach).  The way is pretty straightforward, since there were two main streets available to me.  The two units were nearly identical in calculating the course.  So far, TIED (TomTom still up by one).I further tested the units by making some unplanned turns along the route.  When I deviated from the course, here is where there were some obvious differences.  The Garmin Nuvi recognized the turn slightly faster than the TomTom 350 (only by a few seconds), and the recalculation time was also significantly faster for the Garmin Nuvi, averaging 15 seconds faster.  This may be due to at least two factors:  1) the TomTom 350 is slower in processing speed, or 2) the satellite technology for TomTom (Tele Atlas) is generally (and subjectively) regarded by various online forums to be inferior to Garmin's (Navteq), though this latter factor can be a very hot debate topic.  So, Garmin wins this first functionality test.  (TIED)Next, I tested the units by starting and ending in places that are not so easy to plot.  I started in Diamond Heights neighborhood (Upper Market area, very hilly and the streets are not straightforward) and ended up across into Crissy Fields and planning on going through the Presidio.  Neither units plotted the route I planned on taking, so this is the perfect test.  Once again, the Garmin was able to recalculate sooner and faster than the TomTom 350.  However, both units got me to the same place in the end, and as much as I would like to give it a TIE verdict, I may have to give this test to Garmin as the winner.  (Garmin up by one).Now we will get to expandability.  TomTom 350 has 1GB built-in memory, 95% of which is used out-of-the-box.  I was hoping that the map update would be as easy as the TomTom 340.  Updating the 350 was not as easy.  At first, I could not perform an update (I had to buy the update), so I decided to just use the 350 with out-of-the-box functionality.  The Garmin Nuvi 255W has 2GB built-in memory PLUS an SD slot for map expandability, so upgrading the map did not require further modification of the memory.  The edge goes to Garmin (Garmin up by two).The TomTom can be customized by the user with corrections and updates (new/closed roads, new traffic lights, POIs, etc).  This is done and verified online, and is not available to the Garmin 255W.  Edge to TomTom (Garmin still up by one).There are other features I can review, but I think what I listed above should be enough for 98% of those looking for a decent GPS navigator.  I've had the Garmin Nuvi 255W for a little over a year now, and I have had the TomTom XL 350 for a month.  I've been driving everywhere with these units, and I have to say that though I initially favored the Garmin over the TomTom, the TomTom 340 made me reconsider using a TomTom device, but the 350 made me take a step back.  If I stopped with the 340, I may have considered using the TomTom 340TM exclusively over the Garmin.  Suffice it to say, I will be giving this 350 unit to my sister.The bottom line is that there are some features on this TomTom unit that are superior to those in an equally priced Garmin Nuvi 255W, and there are some features that are inferior.  In the end of my brief comparison, both are decent stand-alone GPS navigators.  The TomTom XL 350 works, it can get you from point A to point B, and has a few extra features that users can either ignore or take advantage of.  It's not the best, but not the worst, and it works (which is why I gave it three stars).  Overall, I can recommend the TomTom XL 350 as a stand-alone navigator.\"", "\"Summary: TomTom XL 350 is a great, easy to use GPS. The large screen is easy to read, and the ability to speak road names makes it much more useful than older models that could only play pre-recorded phrases. Very easy to do all the basic navigation things, and a great 3-D or 2-D map display. Routes are basic (default or \"\"alternate\"\") and some minor niceties from other GPS brands not present, but overall, the best TomTom I have used to date. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to get an easy to use, inexpensive GPS. Updatable content via internet (voices, etc.) is a fun plus (want your GPS to speak like a redneck? Darth Vader?). Near perfect!The Review... First, my GPS background.I bought my first GPS system around 1996. It was a Delorme Tripmate -- large yellow box that plugged up to a serial port on a PC/Windows laptop, then software from CD was loaded on the PC for maps and robotic speech. I made many trips with the laptop seatbelted in my passenger seat. It was a great introduction to GPS technology.Much has changed since those early days of consume GPS systems -- including pricing. In the years the followed, standalone dedicated devices game out, such as the Garmin GPS V which I bought for $300 from Best Buy. This was a tiny black and white unit (with no voice!) that had such limited memory, you had to connect it to a PC and load maps in to it before each trip. Slowly. Over serial port. It was so slow that if you missed a turn while, say, driving through Kansas City, you would be out of luck as the device took so much time to recalculate, you'd miss your next turn :)Fast forward to the 2000s, and TomTom is all the rave with a clever radio marketing campaign that just makes it sound so... nifty. I purchased an early cheap TomTom as a gift for a friend back around 2006. It was very basic and simple, but did the job (mostly). A few years later, I bought a TomTom One for another friend (GPS units make GREAT Christmas and birthday gifts). This unit was slightly improved, but still pretty close to the basic TomTom experience.Overall, I liked the TomTom, but thought my Garmin had some better routing capabilities (just slower and worst screen and no speech). The TomTom failed me, though, when being used in Southern California. It's lack of ability to speak street names made the voice guidance almost useless as it kept giving such generic \"\"keep on the right\"\" and \"\"next right\"\" instructions it was hard to figure out which of the dozens of exits it meant.With that in mind, I must say, I am VERY impressed with how far TomTom has advanced in short time. There have always been higher end models (with a higher price) that could read out street names (usually an \"\"S\"\" model, indicating speech). This is a VERY important feature, which makes the navigation systems in a Honda Fit or Toyota Prius have an edge even if the TomTom experience was still more user friendly than either of those multi-thousand dollar factory add-ons.The TomTom 350 XL has a nice, wide screen, which is very easy to read. They have improved the graphics and now you get a nice 3-D vied of the road ahead and upcoming turns (you can change the car marker to pictures of, say, a VW Beetle or even custom graphics you can load in yourself). Tape the bottom of the screen and it switches to a traditional 2-D North-Up map view. In this mode, it zooms in as you get near intersections, then zooms out when you are on longer stretches of roadway. Nice! (The Garmin did that; but I don't recall many others having that feature.)Strike: I still cannot figure out how to toggle the 2-D map in to \"\"Forward\"\" mode -- where \"\"up\"\" is always the direction you are traveling, not always North. Many folks have trouble reading maps sideways, and I am one of them. Maybe this feature is in there, but the included documentation was almost nonexistent and I couldn't figure it out from menus anywhere.You can easily set destinations by name, address, or moving a pointer on the map. Unlike past TomToms, you can now easily scroll the map by dragging a finger across the screen, similar to an iPhone or iPad (but no multitouch support for zooming; that's done through + and - icons on the corner). You can swap the device for LEFT HANDED or RIGHT HANDED operation, which is a bonus when it comes to punching things in.You can also search for things like Gas Stations (categories/points of interest) or turn on selected icons on the map. I leave mine displaying certain gas stations I like and ATM machines, for example. Just basic GPS stuff, really.When you drive, the display will light up with arrows indicating which lane you should be in! This is great -- on a four lane highway with a right hand exit, the display shows four up arrows and a right arrow (of a different color). At freeway intersections, a 3-D graphical representation of the roadway appears with the lanes clearly marked (and blinking to tell you which ones you should be in to avoid missing an exit). VERY VERY NICE.The voice prompts are GREAT -- telling you things like \"\"turn right, then turn left\"\" (so you know you'll need to stay in a left lane). It will also tell you exit numbers AND the names of the places you are going -- \"\"exit 2, pavilion avenue\"\" or whatever. Again, VERY NICE. It even tells you areas of town -- as I near an exit I take regularly, Clive Iowa, it will tell me \"\"towards Clive\"\". Sweet.TomTom is famous for having custom voices you can load in to the device, and even shows you how you can make your own with free tools you can download. The pre-made voices are mostly commercial (you can buy celebrity voices, like Mister T or Darth Vader or even Homer Simpson) and the community has created hundreds of free (some great, some awful) voices to try out. I like the pirate and the southern redneck voice. Great fun, but gets tiring real fast since there is a very limited amount of phrases they can say. The computer voice sounds very realistic and gives far more practical information.So, play with the voices for a gag and fun, then switch back to computer speech for real navigation.The unit comes with a window mount that suction cupped right to my glass and has stayed. The unit pops on and off easily and a mini USB cable is provided to sync with a PC or Mac, and a car adapter for power it in the car. There are batteries to and the unit will run for awhile without being plugged up -- great if you hop in someones car and need to navigate for an hour or so without a cable on you. (Option accessory: buy the carrying case, and order a screen protector from [...]).Strike: When routing, you have a primary and alternate route, and that is it. I could not find out how to select \"\"shortest\"\" route -- this is important to me, since one place I travel is 15 miles away, taking 16 minutes. There is a 10 mile route my Prius will suggest, that takes 17 minutes, so driving there and back each time on \"\"shortest\"\" only takes a minute longer, but saves me 10 miles on my car lease (and less gas -- do that daily and by the end of the year, and that's a ton of savings in gas). The TomTOm may have this feature, but I sure couldn't find it.Also missing (or I couldn't find it) -- speed notification! Older TomToms has some beep you could turn on to warn if you were driving faster than the speed limit of the road you were on (according to map data). I miss this, and wonder if it's hiding in there somewhere. The menus seem very light compared to older, cheaper TomToms.Most things you do take only a few presses on the screen, but sometimes backing from one menu to another is a bit more work than you feel it should be -- I think the iPhone/iPad/etc. has spoiled me when it comes to touch screens. Overall, though, it's easier to use than either the Honda or Toyota navigation systems, and in many ways better (but built in car systems have some advantages -- larger screen, voice recognition, etc.) The TomTom has no such integration -- phone call comes in, and you have to tap the screen and mute the volume (while a built in Nav would do that for you if you were using car bluetooth handsfree).TomTom Home software is available free, but the link given in the short getting started manual was to a page that didn't exist. It took a few minutes of searching to find the download (and I reported this error to TomTom, but a week later still haven't had my ticket acknowledged). THe software lets you purchase map updates (but you get one free if a newer one comes out or is already out within 30 days of buying the unit -- I got an instant map update for mine). You can also buy add ons, like listings of traffic cameras and such. Higher end TomToms can do traffic guidance and stuff too, but nothing like that in this little one.And a word about route planning -- you can do complex routing with the device, loading in multiple destinations on a trip, but I did not figure this out. Also, they use some kind of \"\"IQ\"\" intelligent route planning that will take traffic and time of day in to consideration, meaning it shouldn't take you down a main downtown street during rush hours -- using an alternate route instead. When I think back to all the times on a long road trip that my Garmin (or older TomTom) took us THROUGH Kansas City instead of around it, thinking \"\"hey, it's all interstate and this is shorter!\"\", I can say this feature -- if it really works -- is worth the price alone :-)GREAT features in this device, and TomTOm is the brand I recommend to anyone I know just getting started. It's a widespread brand that is everywhere and I probably know more people with TomToms than any other specific type of GPS system.Not much else to see -- other than two missing features, overall it's a great device. Even though I have a high end GPS system built in to my 2010 Toyota Prius (with voice recognition and many features the TomTom doesn't have), I wanted a TomTom to take with me on car rental trips, or when riding with others. I plan to buy a carrying case for it and keep it in my travel bag. (Just remember to plug it up to TomTom Home software now and then and get the latest updates, software, graphics, etc.)Buy one.A note about customization: TomTom gives you access to some cool features, like making your own voices to navigate by (a cumbersome, long process, but doable with patience and a microphone). You can also customize the graphic shown for startup and shutdown -- I like to put my photo and name/contact information on the device so if anyone steels it, they will know it clearly advertises it's not their unit (hoping they aren't smart enough to figure out how to change the screen). You can even download or make your own icons for navigation -- want a pirate ship? a trans am? Prius? Make your own or download some of the hundred free ones.For folks who like to tweak their PC desktop wallpaper, you will like what you can do with the TomTom.\"", "\"I got the TomTom XL 350M just before a long trip up to Buffalo NY, so I barely had time to get familiar with it before I left. I did have time to download the updated maps, but be aware it can take awhile.  I did it over a T1 connection and it took nearly an hour.This is my first TomTom as I have been a Garmin user, and in fact I used both of them on the trip, since I didn't even have time to program in a route on the TomTom before I left.Here are my impressions, both positive (+) and negative (-), keeping in mind I am used to a Garmin modelPositive+ The interface is generally very streamlined with very crisp clear fonts on the maps, especially street names.+ I liked that I could not get stuck deep in layers of menu like I can on my Garmin.+ Finding nearby points of interest/locations (like restaurants) is very streamlined.  This made it easy to pick up and go somewhere at a moment's notice.+ The lane guidance is an great feature that my Garmin doesn't have (though I am sure newer versions do)+ the lifetime maps is a killer feature.  I know for my Garmin that would be worth at least 80 dollars in and of itself.Negative- Streamlined simplicity is gained by severely limiting features and customization options.- I did not like how I couldn't simply use the TomTom XL 350M to keep track of where I was unless I had programmed a route.  If I did not program a route, it would go to screen saver ever few minutes.  Since I like to use my GPS to see upcoming street names, that was more than a bit annoying.- I could not figure out any way to find locations like restaurants further ahead on my route or in other cities.  This made it hard to plan ahead.- The suction cup mount would often loosen while we left and fall off after we started driving.  This happened on both the windshield mount method or using a friction mount (not included with the GPS but purchased separately from Amazon)My wife, who has never used a GPS before, likes how simple this one is to use. When we were in and about town in Buffalo, we used this GPS almost exclusively because finding places we wanted to go was much quicker.  I therefore think this is a great \"\"starter\"\" GPS.  For the price , with free maps, I don't think it can be beat.\"", "This is my first GPS although not the first time I've used them.  I've borrowed from others and have even overpaid just to have them in rental vehicles while far from home, which is when I really need navigation.Testing this unit locally, I found the mapping to be completely accurate.  The upper volume was not as high as I'd like.  This TomTom included features that I like a lot such as time, posted speed limit, remaining distance to destination and arrival time.I plan to use the update map feature and note that some have found this problematic.  You get 30 days to do this free from the time you start using your TomTom.While the mapping was accurate, there were a couple mistakes regarding places, but that's not very important to me.  Neither is the voice style, so I won't be paying to download a special voice.I think this is a good GPS unit.  The screen size is ok because a larger size would weigh more and present mounting difficulties whereas this one mounted fine.  I like this TomTom.  Here's the carrying case I use for it:AmazonBasics Carrying Case for Portable GPS Units (Black).", "\"TomTom XL 350M 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator (Lifetime Maps Edition)I am not a tech savvy person... I have resisted using so many products for fear that I wouldn't be able to figure things out and then find myself with another tech toy tossed out or given away.  However, I have to say that this was a very simple product to use and that even a Luddite like me can't screw anything on this product up.A big concern was how it installed - it installs to your windshield with ease and is quite stable.  I tried driving all over our back roads and hitting every bump and pot hole I could find to see if it would fall off.  It didn't fall and stayed very secure. You can also use an included adhesive disk to attach it to your dashboard, but I really didn't like that idea, so the windshield was the way to go for me.  This product has a way to change  from right to left handed...something my husband and I love because we differ in that respect.Corrections to the map when needed are simple to do. Set up did take me quite a while, as the product needs to down load quite a bit of information.Browsing the map to find things like gas stations ATM's and stores is a breeze..The volume is loud enough so I can hear it even when I have my convertible top down.Another useful thing is that it not only tells you how long it will be to your destination, but it lets you know your speed limits and if you are going over the posted speed.Helpful selections include \"\"Drive to Help\"\" for hospitals car repair, police etc .The screen is a nice size and very easy to read and includes lighting for nighttime driving.  There are multiple ways to view the screen (3-d as well as road level) The voices you can choose are veryand I was relieved to hear that this model doesn't constantly \"\"nag\"\" you.  It does give you ample deriving time to change lanes when making exits and turns.The bad----the plugs (male/ female) are small and extremely difficult to maneuver and I found myself a bit frustrated when I couldn't get them to inter-lock without a lot of wiggling.  The touch screen is lovely, but as with other touch products, if you have long nails you will fin it a bit frustrating.  A good option is that you can change the size of the keyboard.\"", "Maybe I don't really need a GPS.  I've never had a lot of trouble getting from here to there.  That said the GPS is an interesting toy.  This machine is easy to set up in just a few minutes though right after I set it up I noticed I had entered the am/pm incorrectly and still haven't figured out how to correct that.  Another bad feature is the display is totally unreadable in the sun. On the plus side I did find a screen that has the latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes to three decimal places which puts you within about seven feet of your position on the planet.  Geography geek that I am I found that really interesting but that doesn't relate much to car travel.  I used the device for about a week before I looked at the manual.  The manual is extremely brief but did explain some of the things I hadn't figured out myself.  Other people have told me about the online manual that I guess explains a lot of the features that aren't apparent on the machine itself but I haven't had a chance to look at that yet. All in all it is an interesting device but not something I consider a must have for me.", "\"I used to have droid gizmos and gadgets and the navigation system in there was pretty good -- not perfect but decent.  Then I drank the Koolaid and went Apple.  I expected the navigation program on the iPhone to be on par with the Droid application (which offered voice-prompted turn-by-turn).  Imagine my surprise when the Apple version (iOS 5/iPhone 4s) only gave you the \"\"list of directions\"\" to follow.  I tried some of the apps but had difficulty when I was in very rural areas where I would lose cell reception -- then I was essentially \"\"flying blind\"\".  This occurred fairly frequently as I embarked on my last trip.  I hate to fly at this point and will avoid it at all costs. So when I had to go from North Carolina to Chicago to visit family, I decided to drive.I wound up not leaving the house until about 5:00 p.m. and wound up driving late into the night. I had no maps with me and in essence was relying on my talking lady to get me up to Chicago. I had made the trip before and more or less knew the way... you head up through the Blue Ridge Mountains and hang a left in Kentucky... cut across and then head north through Indiana. So imagine my surprise when at 2:00 a.m. I was on a rural 2-lane road in Ohio and the talking lady was advising me that I had at least another 75 miles to go. This was a little scary for me since there were no gas stations or businesses open if I were to have any problems. Fortunately, I had filled up my gas tank before I embarked on the great Ohio adventure.After that experience, I decided could not rely on my cell phone for my nav system...I wound up driving back to Chicago a few months later... in addition, I drove up to Eagle River, WI (about 350 miles north of Chicago) and then had to go straight from Eagle River directly back to NC. \"\"Tom\"\" was up to the task -- he didn't send through roads less traveled in the middle of the night (not that there's anything wrong with roads less traveled... just that there is a time and place for that sort of thing and when you have to \"\"make good time\"\" and you have your 2 boys in the car with you, that isn't the time)Tom was nice enough to give me some control over the type of route I preferred -- interstates? country roads? Tolls? I got to pick. Navigation was fairly easy though you have to go through several menus to actually get going -- in this case a little bit slower than my outsourced \"\"talking lady\"\"... but at least I sort of had a clue where I was supposed to be going and if I saw \"\"Welcome to OHIO!\"\", then I knew something was very wrong!The Chicago area is always changing in terms of new roads, new exits and tolls where there had not been any in the not-too-distant past. Tom was on it -- he knew about these changes even before I did. He was able to help me find restaurants, gas stations, and provide alternatives when we hit construction or heavy traffic.I took off one star because the ease of use and navigation of windows was a bit cumbersome. However, I would much rather deal with that than being lead astray so that is a relatively small issue.The upshot is that it is easy to get complacent about your Nav system. However, when push comes to shove, you need to have confidence that the nav system is up to date, that you have some idea of what is lying ahead and you have some say over how you will go. Tom gives that and that is the reason why I will have yet another single purpose device.[NCJVR]\"", "TomTom sells many other GPS unts without lifetime maps.  I have one of those too.  Don't do that.  The maps are way more than the unit if you do.  Buy an old unit like this one cheap and download the maps when they change.  4 stars becaous the download takes hours!!", "\"Great unit for the price. I do not like the fact that the 2D display shows the car symbol on the map going in various directions on the screen.  For example if I am traveling North to South the \"\"arrow\"\" points downwards  and the maps move upwards.  Of course this changes constantly if my direction changes for example to East or West...  The 3 D view is more conventional and the car symbol is always pointed upwards regardless of the car's traveling direction. I have always prefered the 2D view on my older TomTom 540 unit, but I can live with that.Traffic updates/warnings so far have been more a nuisance than help, but I don't know if in other cities they would be more accurate or helpful. Great maps and voice is clear. The unit picks sattelite signal very quickly, typically 40-70 seconds.I would buy another TomTom again, but likely a different model, just because of the 2D/3D view discussed above. This is why I gave it a 4 star rating.\"", "\"I have a Garmin Nuvi 260W and have been happy with it overall. While in Europe a friend was using a TomTom and I really liked the feature of \"\"Center City\"\" go to button. This allows the GPS to take you to the center of a town if you really don't know a street address and just want to get into town to walk around etc. So I was excited to receive the TomTom for my wife's use but that quickly vanished after spending some time with the Tom Tom.For starters, I thought the integrated window suction cup was a nice idea but after using it I will pass on that feature. Yes, it doesn't require you to carry another mounting item which is nice for travel but at least on mine I found it hard to keep the unit mounted on the window and the unit itself kept falling off the mounting. Not sure if it is just someting with my unit but mine kept falling off the window and the unit kept falling off the mounting connection on the back.The GPS for the most part is fine although on my route to work it kept wanting to send me towards the highway and I couldn't find an option in the software to eliminate highway routes. If its there, I can't find it and if I was not familiar with my route this unit would have sent me way out of way. I don't find the map viewing as clean as the Garmin. The map seems cluttered and I just didn't find it very usefull on a lot of things. I understand the feature of not having to type in the state but it seems longer to type in a city and then search a drop down list for the city you want out of a list of other cities in the US with the same name. Not a big deal but I would rather just choose the state and have it reduce the city list.On the plus side, I do like the free updates that TomTom provides compared to Garmin who charges up to fifty dollars for an update. This particular unit does not come with an SD card slot for adding maps via SD card but I guess for most people who use it in US only that is not an issue. I just like on my Garmin how I can add Europe via SD card and remove it when I get home.\"", "\"The good:Lane guidance.  I like to plan my turns and exits, especially in thick traffic.  I hate it when the passenger who claims to know the way suddenly says \"\"Left turn here!\"\" to feet from the intersection when I'm in the right lane and the middle and left lanes are packed with traffic.  No more.  Tom Tom says things like, \"\"Take a right on 17th street, then a left on Maritime Road, giving me time to get into that left lane.\"\"  It also gives you lane guidance for exiting the highway, when it's right two lanes for this highway, and middle two for this bridge and left one for the other bridge.  You can see on screen, and it tells you aloud, which land you want.It tells you \"\"left turn here\"\", which is good when the street sign is missing or obscured.It adapts quickly. It seems to know traffic laws, so it doesn't try to put you the wrong way on a one way the way Mapquest did in the early days.It tracks your speed.The route chosen to a familiar location surprised me, but thinking it over, it was the most direct route.  I normal go one exit on the highway. It had me go a few very small side streets instead.It works in or out of the car, for those who want to use it for camping or geocaching.The bad:Even on the loudest setting, it's a little hard to hear. The pronunciation is off, which one might expect, but the volume is poor.  It's hard to hear, even with no one talking in the car.  Good luck if you've got kids in the back seat.It was a little hard to figure out.  It wants the street then the number, and I tried offering the full address.  Once I figured it out, it was pretty easy and did a great job.\"", "The XL 350T is my 2nd GPS device, the 2nd I acquired through the amazon Vine program. I primarily use the other device (the TomTom GO 740TM Live) and this one is used by my wife. Both are VERY capable and almost ridiculously simple to set up (good news for a guy like me, while I like to THINK I'm pretty tech-savvy, in reality, well...nevermind). Some of the cool advantages of the XL 350T include its ability to customize. Don't like the voices included? Download some new ones (and there are some great ones to choose from). Is your car a different color than the one on the screen? Change it. Wanna go shop at Walmart, Walgreens or the nearest Mall? TomTom can help. Need to take care of a desperate craving for Pizza? No prob. Want the best price on gas, or current weather? Once again, TomTom comes through. As I said, the ability of this device to handle more than just the usual via customizing is alone worth taking a serious look at this particular model.My GO 740TM Live only received 4 stars because I really, REALLY wanted to use the Bluetooth hands-free capabilities making a call during a drive much easier and safer and yet I was crushed at how few phones were compatible with it, kind of making me feel a bit cheated (even though I received it for free). Why, you ask? Because why go through the trouble of having this feature only to restrict it to a very small number of phones? The XL 350T doesn't offer this feature and I expected to give it a full 5 stars except after my initial use I kept missing one small thing: an easy way to boost volume. My other TomTom has voice recognition and a VERY loud speaker. To turn it up all I have to do is touch the microphone on the screen and say, 'Increase Volume' and it does so automatically. Now before I continue, let me say this: I was searching for the volume increase area on the XL 350T without benefit of the manual and simply could not locate it. The reason why I am being so harsh is because, (as far as I can tell) ALL features are amazingly simple to locate and operate--if so, why not make volume JUST as easy to locate and increase/decrease? Arguably working the volume is one of the more important basic functions of the GPS unit, I would think that it would be just as easy to locate...unfortunately it isn't.And THAT, my friends is pretty much the ONLY complaint I have about the XL 350T. Otherwise I have noticed it is VERY accurate (as close as any other competing device I have ever seen at ANY price) and the ease of use (other than the aformentioned volume issues) make this unit a tremendous value when compared to what it can do, where it can take you, the great color touchscreen and for the lifetime of map updates it offers you, if you are in the market for a great unit that will more than make your investment worthwhile, I say you simply CANNOT go wrong with the XL 350T. Once again, my supreme thanks to the amazon Vine program for making this available to me in the first place.", "I have been very happy with my Garmin GPS's and was surprised how well the TomTom XL 350 compares.  Here is a brief comparison based on my use of Garmin Nuvi 680, 350, 205, and 255w:TomTom 350 XL Pros+ TomTom's predictive/suggested names appear as you type (below where you type so not intrusive) for much quicker and easier entry of destination+ Offered in T/M/TM versions which include lifetime Traffic and/or Map updates at extremely reasonable prices.+ Intuitive menu with many selections to help you find what you need without resorting to instructions or trial and error+ Ability to correct maps and download community corrections+ Ultra simple setup and very easy to useTomTom Cons- Garmin presents a more polished main screen with much less clutter-  Garmin units  offer more settings (i.e. GPS will use speeds you enter for different types of roads)- TomTom is a little slower, but not to the point where it would matter to most people- I couldn't find the volume control except to mute the TomTom- Most new Garmins  display speed limit for most roads.- Included windshield mount is harder to use than Garmin's; unit detaches easily from mount while you are trying to adjust it.Overall, I feel both companies make excellent GPS devices that are offered at competitive prices.  The 350 XL is not as polished in some areas as the Garmin devices I've owned.  It also lacks some settings that could be important to you.  However, the TomTom excels at ease of use and could be the better choice if you are looking to avoid instructions.", "\"This is less fully featured than my TomTom GO720, but I think that will be very handy for some people. It seems to me to have all the important basics, and the \"\"lifetime\"\" maps is a great thing. (I put \"\"lifetime\"\" in quotes because of course at some point, they'll stop providing them for this model.)I think I might have preferred the traffic updates version better, but I haven't tried that so I don't know if it's worth the extra money.I was frustrated that TomTom will allow you to have only one device on an account and I had to decide whether to leave my old one on the account or put this one on the account.Like my previous TomTom, this required updates out of the box and it's a little tedious to click through everything. But unlike my previous TomTom, this one worked without a hitch through the updating process and I was good to go.This comes with USA Canada and Mexicooptions to buy more detailed maps for:USA ($49.95)Canada and Alaska ($49.95)Mexico ($41.95)USA, Canada, and Mexico ($69.95)Unsurprisingly, it issues exactly the same instructions as my other TomTom... I've tried using them both at the same time on several occasions to check.So in the end, I think this is a fine basic GPS, although there's no \"\"wow\"\" factor to it.\"", "\"If you wonder why the 340 costs more than the 350, read the reviews. This is the DumDum TomTom. The menus are simplified for your convenience and if that's not your idea of a good thing, you should move on. I don't really have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is TomTom breaking the unit *after* I bought it!I bought this unit because it would read street names. I got it home, did all the updates, and figured out which voice I needed to use to have the street names announced. Then I went for a drive to test the unit, and the street names were NOT announced. I checked to make sure I had the right voice working and even sought out more major streets, thinking that it might not be able to recognize the smaller streets. Finally, I went home and checked out the support forums. Turns out that the latest update of the device software broke the street names if the volume is set above 80 or 85%. The volume at 80% is not enough to hear the unit over freeway noise and moderate radio volume. TomTom acknowledges that their latest update broke the street names and says they will fix it \"\"in a future update.\"\" Great! Nothing like remotely rendering your product defective. I'll wait about a week for a software fix and then return the item. If you would like to avoid the hassle, avoid the product.\"", "This is a bare-bones entry level GPS unit that will appeal to folks who like the idea of never getting lost, but don't want to have to learn a lot of special features.  If you know where you need to go, it will definitely get you there but if you want the sort of added features found on a lot of current GPS units (MP3 player, bluetooth, etc) you will not find them here.The GPS has a suction-cup windshield mount that can be converted to be compatible with ProClip mounts, assuming you are strong enough to pull the mount apart without breaking it.  It takes a goodly amount of strength and frankly I gave up trying, my hands are not that strong.  If you normally remove your GPS from the windshield and take it with you when you're parked, you will quickly discover that the mini-USB power cord is not very easy to re-attach since it has to be carefully aligned with the port it plugs into.I normally use a Garmin GPS and I do prefer the Garmin interface though again, if you are just starting out, you will find this interface very usable.For the price, I'd say this is a decent GPS and I would certainly consider buying one as a gift for an older driver who's not terribly technically savvy, or for a college student getting ready to go off on his or her own for the first time.If, however, you want more special features, I'd look further because there are units that don't cost a lot more but have more functionality.", "This is our first GPS and we love it.  It does exactly what we wanted it to do which was get us from Ohio to South Carolina for our vacation without getting us lost, sending us way out in the middle of nowhere, etc.  We've had a lot of issues with using mapquest, phone GPS, etc in the past so we were concerned about it getting us lost in the mountains or sending us to some tiny town in the middle of nowhere like last year with a borrowed GPS.  We fully charged it before we left and it held the charge for 5 hours of constant use.  We weren't able to get it to charge or turn on by using the cigarette adapter, but we had an ac/dc adapter in the car for my laptop so we just plugged in into that and it charged just fine.The times/miles were pretty accurate though it did seem to have a lag time if you changed from the pre-planned route.I'm sure there are other GPS' out there that offer a lot more bells and whistles, but this is perfect for someone who just wants a basic GPS with a simple interface.  I also like that we don't have to buy new maps and updates like I've heard friends having to do.  It did take about 90 minutes for me to do the first update from the computer, but that was no big deal.  I'm looking forward to using this on more trips.", "\"PROS: great price and featuresCONS: frustrating to use at times, simple things omittedThe TomTom XL 350 price can't be beat. For $129 (on sale at BB) you got lifetime traffic and maps, and that is unheard of. There is also lane assist and full junction view, both great add-ons at this price. The routing seems intelligent. The traffic service is Clear Channel as opposed to Navteq and, in the Philly area, that is a MASSIVE upgrade. You get a signal everywhere and it is a help. The unit overall is fast, especially doing POI searches. The desktop software is clean and easy to use, which is a good thing.Based on the above items, I'd possibly recommend the unit. However, there is a whole laundry list of maddening items:- Why can't I view the route turn-by-turn?- Where is the 2D view with rotating north?- Why are there next to no options? (I can't turn off a toll road warning on a route? Seriously??)- Where is the Mute option? And why is the volume so difficult to adjust?- Why can't I list all traffic events in text view?- Why can't I zoom on the route or traffic map? (not to mention scrolling)- Why is the keyboard so awful? And by \"\"awful\"\", I mean \"\"AWFUL\"\"!!!!! Non-responsive, inaccurate, etc...- Why is scrolling the map next to impossible?- When searching POI's by name, why doesn't it return the location? Search \"\"Starbucks\"\" and you get 30 hits with mileage, but no town or anything.- In general, too many buttons to press to do anything. I now understand what they mean when they say TomTom's are difficult to use.- The power plug is awkward to insert and remove and the mount isn't that easy to deal with either. In fact, the mount stinks.- I needed to manually uninstall unused files (as will you) in order to upgrade my maps. That is a MAJOR BUG and they should be embarrassed it was let out.- If you don't sync every ~7 days to the software, your satellite acquisition times skyrocket to about 2 to 3 minutes. Why? Good question.- The \"\"latest\"\" map doesn't have my work address, but Garmin and Magellan have it out of the box without updates.All in all, the UI is crap. There is no other word. It is pathetically, inexcusably awful. Want to scroll the map? Good luck. Want to see your route? Good luck. (Unless you can see really small things, as it only gives you a picture from WAAAYYYYY up high) Want to see traffic not on your current route? No dice, despite the fact it shows incidents, you can't get a listing. Want to SEE where its rerouting you when it asks? No dice there. We are talking EXTREMELY basic features and this GPS never even considered them. It is mind-boggling.Maybe its my imagination, but it seems like you need to click endlessly to do anything. And it is illogical! If you have a route set and want to search POI's. you need to choose \"\"Alternate Route\"\", then pick a POI, then search. Why is there no POI choice without doing all of that? The software is just **SO** bad.... it made me nuts!It is my sincere hope that some of these items can be fixed with some firmware updates. But, I doubt it.UPDATE 7/7: I lowered my rating to 2 stars and returned the unit. I did so with some heartache too, as it truly routes better (most times) than anything I have seen and the traffic is excellent. Sadly, not being able to see the route is just such a massive drawback that I can't recommend the unit. You have no idea how inconvenient this is until you experience it on a reroute. The lack of options, like not being able to turn off toll road warnings, also is so dumb that this company doesn't deserve my money.Take their routing and traffic and combine it with Magellan/Garmin interface and you'll have a winner. Until then, it is so frustratingly hard to use that it renders itself useless.\"", "Pros: i bought 6 tomtom gps (6 family members) because they are the best based on my opinion.  i am in charged of activation and updating maps all of the gps.  The first one was quite confusing to activate and to update maps but completed the process by talking to a wonderful tech lady.  because it took me time to do the first one.  therefore, it made sense to continue to purchase the same product until they fail me which they have not yet.  i had to activate each gps with is own an account (6 accounts).  after installing tomtom home to my pc, plug in tomtom thru usb cable, turn on gps, select gps &#34;yes, connect my gps to pc&#34;, i was in.  once in i could update maps, manage gps, or purchase any tomtom products.  I saved certain things such as languages and voice to pc then deleted languages and voice from gps to save space.  i have my first one at least 8 years ago and still working fine. it takes gps from a few seconds to a few minutes for it to connect to satellite.  it is much faster to use outside with open sky.Cons: the first one was confusing not because of gps but because i was new to the new product.  if it was the fault of the product, why the next 2-5 gps did not give me any hard time?Opinion: once i purchase a product, any product, that i like because they work well, i stick with the same manufacture.  it may be the same model or may not be but the same manufacture.  this way i won't have to spend time learning about new product.  so many times when i found a product from different manufactures on sale, cheaper than what i paid for.  but i did not buy them because i was not going to waste time learning about it.", "\"I took a while to review this, as I have had several GPS units.I travel between NY and DC frequently, sometimes to remote locations, and was more than  pleased with this unit. The traffic alerts have been sensational, and accurate.Setting up the unit took me about an hour, as there were updates.  I found directions to be correct, with few error's, though the feature to \"\"avoid toll roads\"\"  Could lead one on a LONG journey!For general use, this is outstanding.  I have used it for around 3 month's , and have found the traffic alert's to be sensational! Sort of like having a traffic concierge, if you can imagine.Though not promoted, this one works for \"\"walkers\"\" as well -- the GPS offers you places to visit, driving or walking, which is nice- be it a diner, hotel or monument.  Really nice.You have a choice of voices, most of which are free, though there are paid voices - STAR WARS, Homer Simpson, and a VERY sexy Kim Cattrell are well worth consideration - not mandatory, but fun.This is one item that is pretty much out-of-the-box easy - and a value to most.  If you happen to travel a lot, this unit is LIGHT YEARS better than the units car rental firms offer, at $10-12 a day.Great gift, or something nice for yourself.  After 3 months, this is a keeper!\"", "Not much to say about navigation systems. I like the small petite size--fits in my glove box and works when I need it to.I give this nav system five stars. However, I'd like to caveat this with the fact that I'm not planning on fully using all of the bells and whistles this system comes with. I go on quite a few hikes during the summer and I love this for those trips. But I'm pretty simple when I look for a nav system. The only reason I needed one is due to a hike a few years ago when I got lost in a new area. So I'm glad I had the chance to try this one. The screen is nice and clear and the system was able ...", "\"For the past year I have been a big fan of ourGarmin n&uuml;vi 260W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigatorbut I am always willing to upgrade, and that's what the TomTom XL 350T was. It arrived just a few days before my big summer trip to The Kawarthas (Ontario) from our home in Southern Michigan.Right out of the box I was intrigued by the unique style suction cup. Instead of having a long neck like our nuvi, the TomTom assembly was only about an inch thick when laid flat. After turning it on and following the set up menus I decided to take it for a spin around the neighborhood. Immediatly I was disapoited to find that it had the house numbers on my street messed up and my home address put me half a block up the street according to its maps. I have found the other maps in the device to be very accurate but its easy to notice when your own house number is not correct.Besides the early hiccup with my home address, I found the directions and menus to be clear and intuitive. I also like that when I deviate from the planned course, this device silently finds a new route instead of saying \"\"recalculating\"\" in that accusing voice my nuvi uses. My nuvi would also tell me to make u-turns long after I had found a quicker route. The TomTom seems to avoid making U-turns until absolutely necessary, which is a feature that I appreciate since it's often inconvenient to turn around.I found my favorite feature of this device when I plugged it in to my pc. It had all the driver software and a downloader right on the device, so after a few minutes I was ready to try some of the downloadable features. Through the TomTom program you can download all sorts of custom color schemes, voices, and car icons. Most are free but some you need to pay for. I found a free custom car icon that was a super cute orange kitten head called \"\"TomTommy\"\". This changed my whole feeling about this product. I found myself talking to the device like \"\"Oh Tomtommy, where shall we go?\"\" or \"\"You're just a baby cat, how do you know so much about traffic?.\"\"Tomtommy and I set out for Canada and just after putting in the address I was headed to Tomtommy immediatly asked me if I wanted to avoid toll roads. \"\"Good question, Tomtommy\"\" I answered and we were off. On the way to the border, Tomtommy informed me that I can avoid traffic and save 8 minutes by getting off the highway. I skeptically agreed and found that my surface street detour was actually saving me time.As our trip continued I noticed that every time we passed an exit to local lanes Tomtommy thoughtfully told me to stay left each time, which got annoying the 15th time I heard it. Also I was taken on a \"\"time saving\"\" traffic detour that had me get off the freeway, drive a block, make a u-turn, and get back on the freeway at the same exit actually costing me 5 minutes.The biggest failure of this device happened on the way back from Canada. I asked for a route that avoided toll roads and then it asked me if I would like to avoid car-pool lanes also. Having not seen any carpool lanes on my trip I was not too shocked that Tomtommy suggested a 4 hour detour through New York to avoid a few miles of toll road in Toronto instead of just going around the toll road in Toronto.After I told it I didn't want to take carpool lanes, it asked if I would take a ferry. After answering no to that, it said it could not plan a route. If TomTommy wasn't such a cute kitten I would have been sorely upset.Besides these few flaws, this device has a great map, and some cool extra features like the \"\"where am I\"\" button, and a good collection of points of interest. It also shows you street signs for exits that are sometimes pretty close to what the actual sign looks like.In the end, I would choose the TomTom XL 350T over my Garmin Nuvi for the better looking maps, traffic updates, and the lane indicators. I also have to admit that there will always be a place in my heart for a cute little kitten named TomTommy.\"", "\"I've been a happy owner of aTomTom ONE 130 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigatorfor more than a year and was ready for an upgrade.  First, I boughtTomTom XL 340TM (Lifetime Traffic & Maps Edition) 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator.  After much trouble with the TomTom XL 340TM (my review is posted), I first exchanged it for another dud and then returned it altogether for this XL 350TM hoping that it was the 340 series that was the problem.  The 350 series differs from the 340 series in that it has Easy Menu.What's great about XL 350TM?  It works!  Below are some of the features I find important to note:EASY MENUThere are lots of complaints about the Easy Menu.  For myself, I don't mind it.  Sure, the features are not as customizable as in other models, but it's not a big deal to me.  I can still do things like alter my route, change volume and choose voices.  The basics are still there.  I would especially recommend Easy Menu for someone like my dad, who's electronically challenged.LANE ASSISTLove the Lane Assist feature, especially in places like Southern California.  It even shows the carpool and toll lanes.  At a glance, I can see which lane I need to be in.SPOKEN STREET NAMESOnly the computer voice can speak the street names.  They come out garbled half the time, but I can make them out.  Occasionally, the street names aren't spoken or they are spoken too close to a turn, usually when driving slowly down a neighborhood.  I'm used to glancing at the screen, so it doesn't throw me off too much.LIFETIME TRAFFIC AND MAPSThe Lifetime Maps code that was in the box worked.  We get four updates per year, which is plenty, since I will only use it about once a year at most.The Lifetime Traffic is included in the cable, which must be plugged into the cigarette lighter.  The traffic data is updated frequently.  When there is a backup, I am told how long the delay will be, my new estimated time of arrival, and whether the route I am taking is still the best route.  All of that is both spoken and displayed.  If there is a quicker route around a backup, Tom Tom will ask if I want to be rerouted and I only need to touch the screen once to answer.Traffic is very bad around here in Southern California.  Although I know my way around, I've been using this TomTom during rush hour and I find my commute smooth and very quick.  I am routed onto backroads I never knew existed, but it always works.  I actually hope this Tom Tom doesn't become too popular, lest my newfound lightly traveled roads become congested.My TomTom One has led me astray a couple of times a year.  That's not very much, considering the map was not updated.  I haven't been lost with this XL 350TM, but it's still relatively new.  If the maps become a problem, I will come back to update the review.PROS:+ it works!+ Easy Menu for the electronically challenged+ lane assist+ spoken street names+ lifetime traffic+ map updatable up to 4 times per year+ reroutes around traffic jamsCONS:- less customizable than models without Easy Menu- spoken street names occasionally spoken too late or not at all- spoken street names garbled half the time- traffic cable must be plugged into cigarette lighterSUMMARYThis was a very nice upgrade from the TomTom One and is many times better than my TomTom XL 340TM.  I love the XL 350TM and hope to keep it for a very long time.UPDATE 7/21/13:  I am still using this Tom Tom.  I update the maps occasionally and it works wonderfully.  The only annoyance is it can't say the \"\"0\"\" in \"\"405.\"\"  It will say \"\"four-west-five.\"\"  But I'm used to it.\"", "\"\"\"The Tom Tom XL 350M is a perfectly adequate GPS Navigator.  It is not a stripped-down model, but neither is it top-of-the-line.  I began my GPS experience with Tom Tom's iPhone app on my 3GS, which is also an adequate but not exceptional unit.  The 350M has a few more bells and whistles than the iPhone app, and the screen is, of course, slightly larger.  Both units perform their basic function adequately, i.e., both will get you from point A to point B.Both have similar (nay, identical) pronunciation problems, sometimes humorous, and potentially misleading.The product has a larger than usual speaker, which results in good sound; unfortunately, the speaker faces backwards, so that it will be difficult to hear in a moderately-noisy vehicle.  It would be better if the speaker faced forward or, better yet, if the sound could be routed through the vehicle's sound system.The iPhone app has an Instructions function which, after I've entered a destination, will give me a MapQuest summary of streets and turns; I can't seem to find this on the 350M, which is unfortunate.  I also have difficulty programming intermediate stops on a route, but suspect that I've not yet figured out the right steps.A minor point -- I travel frequently along a major interstate, and both units seem to be required to get me ON to that interstate every few exits, even though I am in fact staying on that road for a long distance.  This is unnecessary and a little annoying.A major annoyance:  the socket for the USB connection and the charger is recessed to the point of ridiculousness -- it is VERY difficult to plug either cord in,and requires extra force - I suspect it will eventually damage the connection to the point that the unit is unusable.I needed a little help with set-up, and tech support eventually got me where I needed to be, but it took some time and confusion.  And then it turned out that it is impossible to get traffic information with this model -- a serious lack, in my opinion.  I was told traffic may be available later, but that doesn't get me home from Seattle tomorrow.Finally, I have two pairs of sunglasses, and the unit's screen is virtually invisible if I'm wearing either pair.  It would be a boon if someone could solve this dilemma.\"\"FK\"", "I think TOM TOM has gotten a little carried away with all the different models availible.  In any case, Im revising my review.  after 4 months of use, while driving on a cloudy day I notcied a black circle on the LCD screen.  at first I thought it was a shadow.  Then noticed no GPS signal.  I went to reset the unit while I was driving and it was extremely hot.  Over the next few days it would work on and off.  Sometimes it would start most times it wouldnt power back up.  than it finally died.while it worked it gave me good directions,  the processor was a bit slow so had to wait a few seconds for the text to catch up with what I was typing in.  I was expecting this to last for at least a couple of years not a few months.  changing my review from 5 stars to one.", "I had several GPS units in my life. I'm not interested on one with Blue Tooth, MP3 player etc. I have that separate.So I'm going to talk GPS, originally I had a Garmin, very nice...I gave it to my youngest daughter...LOLPresently I have a TomTom One which I love because I'm used to set it any old way on the fly, it works fine for me and it's as easy as pie. But I'm giving it to my oldest daughter, so I bought a TomTom XL 350 TM because I wanted and needed TRAFFIC, and this unit give it to me (with lifetime maps and traffic to boot!)I see many folks who are frustrated because they can't find how to turn off the voice, and have difficulty finding features that are there anyway (yes it tells you what street are you on...)Anyway, here's the link to an extensive manual provided by Tom Tom, and there you will find many of the features you are missing.[...]As you can see it's a pdf file, and you can save it to your computer...I haven't looked for a while, but I think that on the TomTom Home you can also access the manual....I hope this helps", "basic GPS and you can also program it to make your own voice commands. It comes with the traffic receiver, typical basic TomTom GPS", "\"I am writing this review of the TomTom XL 350 based on my experience with another entry GPS modelMagellan RoadMate 1212 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI drive a ton for work and need a reliable GPS in order to make all of my appointments safely (trust me, you don't want me to be holding a map and driving!)To make this easy, here are the pluses and minuses of each based on my weekday driving in a 150 mile radius:- Mounting hardware: Magellan clearly wins here.  The TomTom can be knocked out of its mounting hardware when pressing the screen or a button.  Badly designed.- Screen Size: TomTom's a bit of a winner here but I must say I never look at the screen as I listen solely to the voice directing me and keep my eyes on the road.  If neither GPS read the street names this may have been more of a bonus but it's a minimal benefit for me as they both give directions with street names read aloud.- Customization: TomTom is the winner.  Change the colors of the screen, change the look of your car, change to a bunch more voices, etc.  Magellan does not offer as many fun features.  However, if you want the TomTom to read street names (and why wouldn't you???) there is only one female computer voice that is preloaded that offers this option.- Ease of muting the system: TomTom wins by a bit.  They both involve more screen presses than I would like (one touch would be wonderful).  The TomTom involves two screen presses, the Magellan requires three.  If you are wondering why this is important... when you have a phone call come in on speakerphone the GPS just keeps on jabbering right over your call.  How rude.- Route Options: The Magellan wins in some areas... TomTom in others.  The Magellan prompts, before ever calculating your route, options to avoid toll roads, avoid freeways, choose fastest route, or choose shortest route.  The TomTom does not prompt before calculating a route.  Your options once your route is planned is to avoid a foreseen roadblock or to keep hitting \"\"Calculate Alternative\"\" until you have something that suits your fancy (it may never give you the type of route you are looking for).  No option to avoid a freeway altogether that I have been able to find.  HOWEVER, the TomTom does have a \"\"Travel via\"\" option that can allow you to plan a route with another stop of your choosing.  Not possible with my Magellan.- Accuracy: The TomTom wins without a question.  This is the TomTom's strong suit and really is what a GPS is all about.  Getting there without driving in figure 8's through a neighborhood for no reason whatsoever.  The Magellan had me doing all kinds of crazy tricks on a regular basis (driving 3 miles east before going west when all I had to do from the beginning was to make a right turn and I would have been at my destination).In summary, the weakest point of the TomTom is the flimsy mounting system, however, its accuracy more than makes up for it. Between the two, I will trust the TomTom any day to get me where I need to go... even if I have to take a highway when I really don't want to.This is a great choice for an entry priced GPS.\""], "A": [2.75017425499513e-10, 3.5105458037060222e-12, 1.1943019799678438e-17, 1.4109072417334279e-11, 6.393216178679495e-09, 1.315222345095457e-12, 0.9031527042388916, 1.1289550891357969e-11, 6.289068096521078e-06, 3.85783088120882e-16, 1.1458844940623325e-12, 2.6307395151192736e-10, 3.083168376028368e-15, 2.6404125739142026e-13, 1.5426430003740756e-14, 0.0011225769994780421, 1.7139157648671244e-07, 3.804306106758304e-05, 2.860364745060906e-08, 0.026411067694425583, 5.0619693325870685e-08, 5.043871738052985e-07, 0.0013577905483543873, 0.006299916189163923, 1.3023696965319687e-07, 0.061598505824804306, 9.575600415701047e-06, 4.6473705439531443e-10, 2.6024426915682852e-06]}
