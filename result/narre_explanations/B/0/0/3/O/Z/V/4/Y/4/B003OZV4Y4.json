{"reviews": ["Black Rasberry flavored ICE is my favorite drink by far.  It has no calories, a great taste and I love the carbonation.  I rarely drink anything else and my husband laughs about this - what would I do if I had no black rasberry ICE in the house?  The answer to that question is that I'm never without it!  I'm not fond of the other flavors and recommend that you try the black rasberry first and if you like it (and I bet you will) stick with this flavor.Just one caveat: DON'T SPILL IT.  IT STAINS BADLY.", "I discovered the Sparkling Ice beverages about month or so ago. They're quite good and come with a variety of characteristics I like. They're zero calories which is good for my weight watching. They are ever so slightly carbonated but nowhere near the typical carbonated soda. They're only slightly sweet. I tend to like the much lower sweetness Even no sweetness might be better. The taste is mild but excellent and I like the Orange Mango better than the other two flavors I've tried (lemon-lime and raspberry). The bottle is 17 ounces so you can go it alone or easily split it for two. I bought it at a local store but things have a way of appearing and then disappearing, so it's good to know it's available on line. Good product! Light and refreshing!Gary Peterson", "I've tried several flavors of the ICE series and this is my hands down favorite.  Bottles cost $1.00 at all the local grocery stores (ATL area) so when I saw it on sale, I bought several 12 packs.Strong flavor.", "Good flavor and better for you than drinking soda.  I also like the fact that unlike some low calorie drinks it doesn't leave an after-taste. I would rather they used something a little more natural for the sweetener ,but overall if you're looking for an alternative to soda then you might want to give the Sparkling Ice a try.  So far I've only tried the coconut pineapple but am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.", "I love the taste of peach -- cobbler, pie, ice cream, iced tea, etc.  So I saw this, read the reviews specifically for this flavor, and decided to give it a try.It's .... good.  Definitely taste the peach and nectarine.  Nice over ice on a hot day.  But I keep picking up another flavor:  watermelon!  Maybe it's just how my &#34;taster&#34; works, but there's definitely a strong flavor accent of watermelon when I drink this.It's not enough to deter me from drinking it -- but I have to say I was just a *bit* disappointed.  Would I purchase again?  Maybe.  Jury's still out.  If I stop thinking about it as &#34;peach/nectarine,&#34; and start thinking of it as &#34;fruit salad with peach, nectarine, and watermelon,&#34; I think I can get over it.  But I still like my Snapple peach iced tea for my liquid peach fix.", "\"You might have seen my reviews on three ICE flavors. This one is good. It has less bite than the pink grapefruit, but it's not overly sweet like the pineapple and coconut. I'd consider it a light taste, in the middle of the grapefruit and pineapple. There's no \"\"diet drink\"\" aftertaste with this flavor, either. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, like sugar, with the ICE drinks.\"", "I have to say, this drink is probably my 2nd favorite of the Sparkling Ice line-up (the first being the Coconut-Pineapple) and it is very delicious.  As a away to quit drinking soda, I've been looking into healthier alternatives, and the Sparkling Ice brand is one of the brands I've found to try out.  And I've enjoyed almost all of them.Black Raspberry tastes exactly like black raspberries.  It's a little bit sweet, and has that tangy raspberry in the sun flavor.  And the aftertaste is just the same as the original taste so you don't have to worry about a shock of sour or other weird flavor.  It also has carbonation so you get that pleasant fizzy feeling on your tongue while drinking that makes soda so popular.  One bottle is pretty large too, 17 ounces, and I've found that it will get me through most of the morning at work, although it stops being cold after awhile, but hey, it even tastes decent warm.The ingredients are pretty good too.  With the exception of the sweetener being sucralose, which I'm not crazy about, they have green tea extracts, actual raspberry flavors, and spring water listed.  And the list is short compared to a lot of drinks out there.  It may not be the healthiest, but it's not as bad as soda either.  And it's still 0 calories, which for a flavored drink is pretty good.  They also put in a few vitamins to the mix, such as B3 and a some other B vitamins so you can pretend you're drinking something healthy as a result of that as well.I will keep buying these drinks as a soda replacement.  They're reasonably priced and taste good and make the no-caffeine transition easier.Review by M. Reynard 2012", "A  tasty alternative to iced tea and pop. I keep these chilled in frig for a quick thirst quencher. They have ZERO calories and are flavorful.", "This beverage is ok.  The stats are good, but the flavor is really off on my palate.  It does not taste anything like berries to me, it tastes like apple juice?!  I hate apple juice.  The color leaves crazy stains so sip carefully.  I like the orange mango flavor from the store, I had an issue with taste from an amazon order but they made it right.  Taste one from store before ordering a ton of them here!"], "A": [0.07144059240818024, 0.06660435348749161, 0.1346573829650879, 0.11441794037818909, 0.1298396736383438, 0.17362743616104126, 0.08428236842155457, 0.12853796780109406, 0.09659231454133987]}
