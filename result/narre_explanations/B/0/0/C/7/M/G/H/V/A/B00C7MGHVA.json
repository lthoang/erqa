{"reviews": ["This tea is really good, and works well in our Keurig.The flavor is balanced, like a lightly steeped cup of tea (it is not the strongest tea...).Overall, recommend.", "i was a bit wary of making an iced drink with my Keurig, an appliance meant for hot beverages. I suppose I thought it would be somewhat more involved than they typical K-cup brew.There's a 3-step instruction guide on the top of the box, but it's pretty simple: you dispense the tea into a cup filled with ice. Voila! Iced tea.I've got the unsweetened version, and the taste is exactly what you'd expect from a Lipton product. It's good, but it's not going to taste like iced tea brewed with loving, attentive care with the freshest, most expensive ingredients. However, if you're considering making iced tea in a Keurig, then this will definitely do the trick. It's an easy way to make fresh-tasting iced tea.", "I work out of my house and use my Keurig several times a day.  Since it is spring and moving into summer I am moving into iced drinks.  I am mostly a coffee person, but like the occasional tea drink in the afternoons.  This is the best tea I have tried.  It is sweetened, although not overly sweet and has just enough lemon to flavor it without overwhelming the taste.", "It's not rare for me to try a food product through the Vine program that I think is good, but it's not common for me to like one so much that it changes my normal routine.  This did!  I really enjoy this tea.I think that this has a really good mix of spice and sweetness.  I drank a few cups with nothing added and loved it, and then I tried the suggestion on the box and added some milk to it - delicious!  The milk helps to smooth it out, but it's not necessary at all.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to you to try.I do have a couple of notes, though:1. I didn't realize before getting it that it has sugar already added, so I wanted to mention that here.  It has 45 calories per serving.2. The plastic walls of the k-cups are thinner than others that I've used (and I've been using them for seven years).  In my k-cup brewer, this hasn't caused any problems.  I mention it for others of you who, like me, might want to use these in your Vue brewers using the Solofill adapter (I have the V2 version).  If you use that, you need to be careful when you insert these, and I highly recommend puncturing the bottom first.  The first one that I tried just crushed when I tried to insert it, so I do open a small hole on the bottom first and then insert it slowly.  Sometimes they have leaked in my Vue brewer, but not often.So, again, highly recommended!", "I wanted some iced tea and i did not have my brewer around. So i used my Kuhn Rikon single cup brew. It turned out excellently. The tea has a nice flavor to it , but it does come out a bit strong, so make sure you have loads of ice to temper the taste. It is a refreshing drink that is easy to make with a brewer or any coffee/tea press.", "\"OK I thought I ordered plain green tea K-cups.  To my horror I read on the box that they were green tea with \"\"herbs & other natural flavors.\"\" Yikes!  I don't like spices in my tea.  I suppose my dislike comes from a childhood of lemon & honey flavored teas - yuk.  Well I was surprised to drink my first cup.  It was more green tea and less spices.  It was better than I thought it would be.  A nice mellow, refreshing tea to unwind the tale end of the day and transition to bed.\"", "First I've tried a variety of K-cup ice teas and this one is a surprise.  I don't particularly like Lipton teas (the usual tea bags - I find them weak and tasteless) so I never thought to try their k-cup tea.  Every now and then I have to check to see if my prejudices are valid and this product was available so I thought I should try it out.These K-cups make a nice strongly flavored brewed tea with just a touch of sweetness -- I usually don't sugar my tea so consider that against your tea sweetening habits.  The sweetner, according to the box, is sugar -- which is a plus for me since many of the artificial sweeteners give me headaches and yet, it comes in at 50 calories per large cup.  Made according to direction it make a strong cup of ice tea (you fill a large cup with ice -- meaning full to the top -- and then press the button on the machine for a large).  Most of the ice melts as the hot tea streams into the cup.  As the rest of the ice melts it gets a bit more diluted but still maintains a fairly good tasting tea.Not content to just make a mug of ice tea following directions, I put in a fresh k-cup and using a measuring cup (one rated for boiling water) and double tapped for large cups.  The tea coming out still looked pretty strong so I did a third tap for a small cup. This made about 3 cups of tea.Next, I poured a bit in a cup for hot tea.  Not bad still just a tad of sweetness so no need to add more unless you like a sweet cup of tea.  (I don't use milk products in my tea so use of milk might change the flavor.)Next, I had small cup of the tea over ice.  Just as good as when I made it according to directions.  Note because I'm now using more tea to ice -- the tea doesn't dilute as much toward the end when all the ice melts.Finally, I had some sugar free raspberry flavoring syrup for my coffee and I poured the rest of the tea over ice and added a 'glug' of the raspberry syrup.  Heaven -- slightly more sweet but more tart in taste than the raspberry flavored ice teas I've tried.", "I ordered the unsweetened version but have been disappointed as the tea has a sweetish aroma and an orangey color and does not taste as good as a plain old black tea brewed up the typical way. I like the flexibility of being able to add less or more sugar to unsweetened tea. But with Keurig there are too many steps.First I make the tea with the K-Cup, then I have to stir in sugar or a sweetner and then pour that mixture over ice in another glass. If I don't cool the mixture a little before I have to pour it over lots of ice and it dilutes the taste of the tea making it pretty bland. It seems like a lot of steps for something I can do more easily and cheaply with a teabag. I will stick to making hot tea and coffee with my Keurig.", "We use our Keurig a lot in the winter for hot teas and hot chocolate. Now to find that we can enjoy a glass of ice tea on a hot day is wonderful. One glass is perfect for me, so it's nice to not have to make a whole pitcher that may go to waste. The flavor comes out perfectly each time and cleanup is as simple as throwing the used k-cup away. No more drippy tea bags!", "So easy and great tasting! I love my Keurig and was very excited to try something non-coffee. A tip before you begin brewing: I find that if you just brew w/out the ice you don't have to worry about any overflow. All you do is brew w/out ice then pour everything in a tall glass w/ice. Also have extra ice cups on hand for your first batch will melt all the way down.The tea itself has a nice rich taste. If I didn't know it was Lipton before I am sure I would be able to guess that it is Lipton due to the same Lipton ice tea taste. Just because you didn't buy the Lipton in a bottle doesn't mean it will taste completely different for I feel that they taste just the same only more convenient in a K-Cup.I would buy again due to the taste, ease of using, the amount of K-Cups in the box when compare to price.", "\"I like Lipton tea.  In fact, I have several boxes of Lipton Green Tea flavors on my kitchen counter.  And, on occasion, I also bthe bottled ice tea in the supermarket.But, this Keurig brewing formula is not up to the standards of the other Lipton styles.There's something about the aftertaste--I think it may have to do with \"\"Reb A\"\" a Stevia extract.Why not just have natural, unrefined, unbleached sugar?Lipton \"\"Refresh\"\" 3 stars.\"", "This is not as good as the expensive tea bought from the tea shop, that I steep carefully.  But it is a lot more convenient, and is good enough for even a tea snob to enjoy regularly.  The extra caffeine is appreciated", "So this doesn't actually taste lemonade-like  at all to me. If anything it tastes a bit like tea with orange in it to me. Even the color of the liquid is more of an orange shade. It is very sweet to me but I usually drink my tea unsweetened. If you need a sugar boost when it's hot out this is fairly good but I'm not sure that I would get it again.", "I was expecting pure black tea in a K-cup, unadulterated, unsweetened, just the clean and bracing flavor of pure black tea. What I got was some odd vanilla flavored beverage. It is not disgusting but it is certainly not black tea. The ingredients say this product contains orange pekoe and pekoe cut black tea, natural flavor and soy lecithin. It tastes like one of the Celestial Seasonings seasonal offerings. On the other hand the K cup worked perfectly. But this strangely flavored concoction is just not my cup of tea.", "i like the convenience of the Keurig brewers but i haven't found a great tea for it.  this tea is ok but tastes a bit flat.  i find even Lipton's own tea bags tasting better.  maybe tea needs to be steeped & not just dripped.", "\"Do we really need sweet tea k-cups? Probably not. How much more difficult is it to put a tea bag in a cup? But if you have a K-cup coffeemaker already, you might want to stock up on a few tea k-cups as well. To use these, you put the k-cup in and run the machine, letting the hot tea go into a cup full of ice.So if this were an excellent glass of iced tea, I'd say \"\"Go for it\"\", but the tea is not quite right. I've made multiple cups. I love iced tea, and I drink both sweet tea and un all summer. I figured these would be nice if I'm between pitchers. But the flavor is off in some subtle way. There's maybe a slightly chemical aftertaste? Our coffeemaker can make three sizes of coffee with the k-cups in place. I've tried all three sizes. The big cup is too weak, the medium size is bland, and the small cup is okay, but not nearly as good as homemade tea. Don't know why, but the result has been consistent. Family members agree.I like k-cups, but ultimately don't think this iced tea version is good enough to use regularly.\"", "I swear that this kcup is no more than an ordinary Lipton teabag x5 the price.  It tastes exactly like you would expect from Lipton.  There is really not much to say except that I can't get past the cost inflation for this item and I feel as though I would be throwing money out the window, had I paid for this item out of my own pocket.It's the KCUP variation of a Lipton tea bag.", "I love my Keurig but when it comes to tea, I am a bit of a tea snob. I decided to see how these tea k-cups compare to steeping a cup of tea from a teabag. I must say I prefer the teabag mostly because of the huge difference in price. The Lipton K-cups are nice and convenient and even have a good flavor but the price per cup is much higher. There is a bit of sweetener after taste with these k-cups. I will stick to teabags and being able to control my own sweetener in my tea.", "I'm a long-time tea drinker, and at home, I take time to make a proper cup, boiling the water with a kettle (never microwave) and using a good-quality tea bag.  At work, however, we have a Keurig machine for public use, and I thought it would be nice to try these K-cups in that setting.I was worried that the K-cup might produce an overly strong brewed cup of tea--or worse, one that didn't taste fresh brewed at all.  To my pleasant surprise, these Lipton K-cups made a cup of tea that was brewed perfectly to my taste.  Once I added cream and sugar, I would have been unable to distinguish this from a cup of tea made with a tea bag.Like all K-cups, these are rather pricey, but if you are looking for convenience AND a good cup of tea, I would recommend them.", "I enjoy Lipton's brand of teas. They aren't posh or amazingly tasty, but their Black Tea in particular is a daily habit I indulge. The taste is consistent and nice. It's a nice cup of tea that I can make quick and easily. So I was pleased to see these. The price is worth it too.", "At first sip I thought this was the best tea I've tasted in awhile. But the more I drank, the odder the taste got. It's a green tea for sure, but there are herbals in this blend that are just a bit off-tasting. They just don't sink up. Maybe there's too much bergamot (?) I just can't drink it much at all now. I can stand it better cold so I may finish the box that way.", "\"This is a very sweet chai tea.  I have tried several versions of chai tea and this is the only one I have tried that I do not have to add sweetener, but some may find it to be a little bit too sweet for their liking.  It has a nice chai flavor to it.  I prefer to add milk or half & half to it to cut some of the sweetness.As for some of the other reviews, apparently, people cannot read.  There is no mention on the box or the ingredients that this product contains Stevia, so I assume it does not contain a reportable/material amount of Stevia.  The ingredient list includes sugar, maltodextrin, and sucralose as sweeteners.  It is 45 calories per serving.  Also, the ingredients plainly include \"\"black tea.\"\"  It doesn't taste like traditional black tea because it includes the spices that give it the classic \"\"chai\"\" flavor - cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, black pepper, chicory, etc.\"", "We have a new Keurig coffee machine thus when this product was shown on the Vine page we opted quickly for it. We received 24 cups in the package They were all the same, Soothe Green Tea. However the title is not all that complete. The green tea is blended with chamomile flowers, lemon verbena, spearmint leaves, rosetips, orange peel, hibiscus flowers, lemon grass, spices, orange juice concentrate, orange pulp, chicory, sunflower lecithin and soy lecithin.Don't let all the ingredients floor you as we tasted a hint of orange along with the green tea. I am sure those who are experts in tea making and drinking will recognize all the other flavors as they enjoy an excellent cup of freshly brewed Green tea.Using the Keurig means at our house the maker is always ready to make quickly another cup of coffee or tea. With almost no clean up afterwards as you just toss the little pod. Great product from Lipton.", "This 'natural energy' premium black teas brews a strong cup of tea when you chose a standard cup size.  It has a pleasant, but sweet, bold tea flavor.  I love k-cups for coffee, but given less of an ability to more finely control how bold this tea brews would not routinely by these cups for use.", "I definitely love the idea of green tea in a K-cup. I need/want to drink more green tea for health reasons, but forget to make it the traditional way. K-Cups make it as simple as tossing it in and pressing the button. The hardest part is waiting the few seconds for it to brew.The Lipton SOOTHE Green Tea is strong. It has that green tea flavor with a hint of lemon. I think it would feel particularly good in the winter cold and flu season when that strong flavor is an advantage.", "These K-Cups work perfectly in our Keurig.  The sweet tea is a little bit sweet, but not too sweet for me.  Though some family members would need to add extra sugar to their cup, we are in the South after all and here sweet tea is supposed to be SWEET.  If you want just a touch of sweetness this is the flavor for you.", "One star says it all. Not a Lipton that I am used to.  A bitter, weak brew.  I am trying to send it to the office with my hubby.  He keeps leaving the bag(bg)", "I was skeptical -- suspecting instant tea inside the K-cup, but it was surprisingly loose-leaf green tea leaves! Nice surprise! Now for the brewing: extremely easy, if you only want one cup of tea, which has been very convenient for our household with teens and college student who grabs a cup at a time and for adding to our variety of K-cup flavors and choicesThe flavor: very mild. While I tend to prefer hot tea to be a very strong black leaf tea, this green tea was really very, very pleasurable! I did add a dab of agave for sweetness, and enjoyed the tea hot. Also, over ice -- very good and I actually prefer this milder green tea flavor ICED.Again -- Surprised! Pleasantly. I would def recommend it for K-cup users.", "Generally, I like these K-cups.  The tea does taste brewed and, for me, has the right level of sweetness.  I followed the instructions and brewed as an 8oz cup, then poured over ice.  You'll need a lot of ice, so it easily made a 16-20oz glass.  Even then, it had the right strength and sweetness for me.  The one thing I didn't like was that after drinking, it seemed to have a metallic aftertaste in my mouth.Ingredients: Sugar, orange pekoe and pekoe cut black tea, REB A (Purified Stevia Extract). 50 calories each, 13g sugar.", "These are great K-cups. The chai flavor is robust and has a nice, mysterious flavor just like a good cup of spiced tea. I really appreciate the fact that these are already sweetened, so I don't need to bother adding honey or sugar, which is convenient.At the current price point these really aren't any more expensive than decent loose / bag tea and are compatible with my Keurig brewer. I like to have one of these near the end of the work day, when I want something comforting to drink but don't want to spend all evening wired off another cup of coffee.I'm a fairly avid coffee / tea drinker and have to say I'm surprised and impressed that Lipton (which I always sort of assumed was a 'bourgeois' tea company) is offering such affordable and pleasant K-cups. I'm going to have to look into their other offerings... looks like they have sweet tea cups as well!5 stars for great flavor, decent price and convenience.", "Owning a Keurig makes it easy to serve up a piping hot cup of coffee or tea. Just turn on the appliance, pop in a K-cup, press the button and walla- a cup of steaming hot beverage is ready to drink. There is no waste and you make only what you need so nothing goes to waste.Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea Lemonade is as easy to use as any other K-cup. It carries the Lipton name, so it has a solid reputation behind it. These are all good things, but I have to say that the beverage itself is only so- so in taste. It&#8217;s a little on the sweet side, at least for me. I usually drink my tea unsweetened, but I can handle a small amount of sweetness. This one goes a tad far in the sugary direction so it doesn&#8217;t necessarily suit my preference.Aside from the sweetness, Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea Lemonade is also somewhat artificial in taste. I tried a few different cups, hoping that perhaps I got a bad K-Cup. But each cup of tea tasted about the same as the last. The flavor seemed a little off- not bad, but not anything amazing and not as good as some of my favorite all- natural, tea- bag style teas or other K-cup teas.I drink quite a bit of tea and I love the convenience I get with my Keurig. But not all K-cups are worth drinking and Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea Lemonade is one of them. It isn&#8217;t terrible, but the artificial flavor and sweetness level convince me to rate tis product below average.", "First, no one can reasonably expect a cup of K-cup tea to measure up to a cup of properly brewed and well-prepared tea, this tea has to be judged by the standards of other K-cup teas.  And by those standards, it's a decent cup of tea.  Not too bitter, but not weak either.  Put a couple of spoons of sugar or honey in it, and it's a pleasant way to start the day."], "A": [0.038497693836688995, 0.018515251576900482, 0.055375248193740845, 0.019806936383247375, 0.023267541080713272, 0.043991319835186005, 0.016463201493024826, 0.03332054987549782, 0.025717569515109062, 0.026924720034003258, 0.02952909842133522, 0.04729488492012024, 0.057960063219070435, 0.01956883817911148, 0.040898118168115616, 0.00953394453972578, 0.05653442069888115, 0.035384293645620346, 0.024860454723238945, 0.03630787506699562, 0.036217521876096725, 0.04456660896539688, 0.020836062729358673, 0.04289263114333153, 0.01809585839509964, 0.05630682408809662, 0.01719016581773758, 0.015084179118275642, 0.022515296936035156, 0.00785140972584486, 0.020302649587392807, 0.03838873282074928]}
