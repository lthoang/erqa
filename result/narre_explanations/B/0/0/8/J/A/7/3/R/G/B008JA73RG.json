{"reviews": ["I've previously tried thePomegranate/BlueberryV8 energy drink and enjoyed it, so I was happy to also try this peach/mango flavor. Overall, the nutritional content of these drinks are pretty much the same: 50 Calories and 10g of sugar, which is pretty good in comparison to other energy drinks. It also has a decent amount of vitamins C, B6, and B12, but that's nothing you couldn't get just by popping a vitamin pill.Upon opening the can the peach smell is strong, but the actual fruit flavor is pleasantly subtle (this is similar to the blueberry/pomegranate version). The drink also has the mouthfeel of mango juice, but the peach flavor displaces the mango flavor for the most part. According to the nutritional info, this drink also contains all sorts of juice - sweet potatoes, yellow tomatoes, carrots, etc. - but I personally can't detect any of that.Overall, it's a very light energy drink, meaning it's quite easy way to get 80mg of caffeine. I think I prefer this peach/mango version, but they are both pretty good.", "\"I did not enjoy the flavor of this product. I am not sure if it was the \"\"peach mango\"\" combination or the presence of artificial sweeteners but there was a very definite chemical taste while drinking it and a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste.  For those that might enjoy these taste sensations, there is also 100% of one's daily allowance of vitamin C and a good bit of caffeine in the product (roughly equivalent to a cup of brewed coffee).  That being noted, and allowing that others might enjoy the taste of it, I still cannot recommend this flavored energy drink.\"", "I had hope that with this being a V8 fusion and green tea product that this would be a healthier energy drink mostly based on fruit vegetable products. Each 8 ounce can does contain some fruit and veggie juice and provides a reasonable amount of vitamins with only 50 calories.  However it had a significant amount of caffeine.  The peach mango flavor was well balanced and intense enough. However, at about a dollar for 8 ounces, it won't become a go to product for me.", "I really enjoyed the taste and energy boost of V8 Fusion.  I really like the fruity taste and the fact that there is no added sugar.  Also, the fact that the caffeine is sourced from green tea gets 5 stars in my book.A pleasant drink that really works.  Highly recommended.", "Most energy drinks are absolutely gross to me.  That being said, I actually liked this one.  It gave me energy without that creepy skin-crawling feeling I get from other energy boosters.  It wasn't amazing energy, but when you're looking for that spastic energy, I think that's when you end up with the buzzed jitters.", "\"Taste:The V8 Peach Mango drink starts off with a tang, which mellows quickly. The consistency is kind of pulpy, which seems to be standard for V8 Fusion drinks.  I didn't find the pulpiness to be very filling, but the Peach Manago tastes pretty good for what it delivers (vegetable & fruit supplement).  There isn't an aftertaste. Overall, the taste wasn't bad, and the V8 was certainly better tasting than a typical energy drink.Energy Boost:The V8 supposedly contains 80mg of caffeine. I couldn't tell. Perhaps it is because my body is use to caffeine & 80mg was \"\"nothing\"\" in comparison to my regular intake? In any event, the V8 was too light on caffeine to fit my \"\"energy\"\" needs at this point in time.Ingredients:The V8 label says that the 8 fl oz contains 1/4 vegetables & 1/4 fruit. That is pretty good for a 50 calorie drink.UPSHOT:To me, the V8 is not an energy drink; however, in the supplement drink category, the V8 has its place.\"", "I was surprised that I liked this drink as much as I did.  Normally most beverages that are mixed with vegetable juices turn me off with the taste, but this one didn't.  The peach is much more prominent than the mango which didn't matter to me, but might to someone that doesn't care for it. I drank it in the morning, very cold and within 3-4 minutes. Although not a lot, I do like the addition of some vitamins which I don't get with my coffee. As to how it compares to my coffee? It says it has almost the same amount of caffeine as an average cup of coffee and since I didn't find myself tired halfway through my morning, I will assume it's true and that it had the same effect on me as coffee does. The size for me was just about right, anymore and I probably wouldn't have finished it in one serving. Also looking at the current price I think this definitely competes with my daily coffee if I were looking to change it up a bit.", "I'm not a soda or coffee consumer, nor am I a fan of Red Bull or Rockstar, so I'm always on the lookout for viable sources of caffeine. At just 8 ounces per can, the new V8 Fusion Energy Drink might be my new go-to drink. With a mere 50 calories and 80mg of jitter-free caffeine, V8 Fusion is a convenient, low(er) calorie option to get you through the afternoon slump (or get you going in the morning). Here's a quick breakdown of the nutrient profile:Calories: 50Total Fat: 0gCholesterol: 0gSodium: 50mg (2%)Potassium: 170mg (5%)Total Carbohydrate: 13g (4%)Dietary Fiber: 0gSugars: 10gINGREDIENTS:Water, Reconstructed Vegetable Juice Blend (Water and Juices of Sweet Potatoes, Yellow Tomatoes, Carrots, Yellow Carrots), Reconstituted Fruit Juices (Water and Concentrated Juices of Apples, Oranges, Peaches), Contains Less Than 2% of: Mango Puree, Natural Flavoring, Green Tea Extract (With Natural Caffeine from Green Tea), Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Sucralose, Vitamin E, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1 and Vitamin B12.As you can see, neither the Peach or Mango play a prominent role in the flavoring, which is quite evident upon the first sip. The predominant flavor I could taste was that of tomato and carrot, but the fruit blend was certainly present and added a refreshing sweetness to the beverage. I enjoyed the flavor combination, but I could see how some might find it less-than-pleasant, especially if expecting a strong Peach Mango flavor.The caffeine, not too high or low at 80mg, kicked in fairly quickly and sustained me throughout the afternoon, and I experienced no subsequent crash. Just a pleasant boost in alertness and focus, which is exactly what I was looking for.Overall, V8 Fusion Energy is a great alternative to soda, coffee, Red Bull and the plethora of high-octane energy drinks, offering convenience in a small 8oz can. The price might be a little bit too high to make it more economical than coffee or soda, but for the occasional energy boost, you can't miss with this drink!", "This is a light refreshing drink that only contains 50 calories.  It has a slight after taste of mango and peaches but since it contains so few calories, you won't get the real fruit taste.  The energy is supplied by the green tea extract, but if you are a heavy coffee drinker like me you won't get any jolt from it.  Bang for your buck wise, it's pretty expensive.  It's a healthier alternative to other energy drinks.  If you are constantly on the go and don't like coffee, then I would recommend this, otherwise I would skip it.", "I've picked up cases of V8 Fusion (but not the energy drinks) at Costco, and I've liked them. I like that the sweetness comes from the actual fruits and vegetables, not added sugars. But the regular V8 Fusion drinks are a little too heavy and sweet to have as a drink with a meal. (I think of them almost like a meal replacement, with a piece of cheese or slice of whole grain toast if I'm really hungry.)But, being only 50% fruits and vegetables (the rest I presume is the green tea), this energy drink is really good with a regular meal. The peach mango flavor is surprisingly tasty, and I could see it substituting for coffee and orange juice at breakfast. It does have a punch of caffeine, of course, which is where the energy boost comes from; that and the antioxidants and vitamins in the veggies and fruits. I'm not as wild about the Pomegranate Blueberry flavor, which surprised me because I would have thought that would be the one I would like the best. So when I buy a case of these, I'll go for the Peach Mango. I think V8 ought to package up a sampler of different varieties so people can try several flavors before committing to a whole case.I definitely like the 8-ounce serving size, and also that I'm getting the health benefits of the green tea. I tend not to drink green tea on its own, so this V8 Fusion Energy line is appealing to me. I haven't tried doing this yet, but I'll bet if I drink a can of this about half an hour before dinner, I'd have better luck with controlling meal portions and eating less. There are lots of vitamins in these drinks, too, especially Vitamin B and C.", "This V8 fusion energy drink combines the flavors of mango, peach, and green tea in a low, 50 calorie pick-me-up.  The taste is reasonably pleasant, with mild mango the most prominent flavor.  The eight ounce can is a convenient size.  There is a mild energy boost sensation, which did not measure up to the morning cup of coffee for this reviewer, but is probably healthier; recommended.", "I was so excited as I love the orginal V-8. I thought this would taste awesome as I love anything mango, but this s just plan nasty. I did not detect peach or mango only a slight pear taste.It smells slightly fruity with the veg /green tea slightly detectable.  It has a lightly sweet taste, but for me it had a nasty bitter green tea after taste that lingered.  It did not give any energy boost.I saw no difference.Everyone's tastes are different and subjective, do not neg me just because I hated it. This is my experience and you my have a dfferent one.", "This energy drink has a nice flavor and delivers a full serving of fruits/veggies with only 50 calories.  I also appreciate that it has more caffeine than a soda but a bit less than a cup of coffee.  Perfect for those who prefer their healthy foods in liquid packages.", "This is a very refreshing and nutritious drink that offers a unique taste.  Differing from the traditional sodas and tea drinks, this V8 Peach Mango drink is an attractive alternative.  It is not overly strong - not trying to shout out that it is different by overwhelming your taste buds, just simply interesting and easy to drink.  I've enjoyed this product when particularly thirsty after having worked outdoors, but also just as much sipping it while reading a book.  I don't choose to drink it everyday, but I generally keep a few cans in the refrigerator all the time. Best served quite cold.", "I don't use energy drinks very often; I know of too many people who have suffered from health consequences. However, there are times when an occasional boost of caffeine, usually with vitamins and other nutrients that can help me over the related stresses, can get me through an important task. I was looking forward to a V8 Fusion version. It's ok, but I had expected it to be sweeter than it was. I didn't mind the calorie count being low, but I would have preferred anything peach-mango flavored to be sweeter.", "This is the third V8 energy product I have tried.  It is the best tasting.  It doesn't taste overly sweet and has a nice fruity tang.  There is still more sugar than I would like. The fusion energy drink has some added vitamins that add to the energy benefit. I struggle with drinking sugar but if you were going to go with a more natural energy drink I would recommend this one.", "\"I'm not usually a \"\"sweet\"\" fruit juice drinker but I did enjoy the V8 Fusion Energy Drink Peach Mango.  The predominant flavor was peach with a slight mango note.  The only problem was the sucralose after taste was simply too sweet and artificial for me.  Otherwise, a good tasting fruit drink and probably an excellent way to get some vegetables into your diet if you don't ordinarily eat veggies.  As I love veggies and fruit both, it probably isn't a drink that I would buy regularly but would recommend it to anyone who does like sweet drinks.\"", "I have always liked the V8 product line of drinks over the years and this new line of energy drinks is no exception.  I preferred the Pomegranate flavor to this flavor but this is a personal choice and I didn't dislike this flavor at all.  It's crisp and light with a distinct kick of energy from the caffeine at the end.  I always felt that the taste of Redbull was rather harsh and so this is a very nice contrast.At 50 calories you aren't going to be going overboard on your diet either, which is always a plus.  It's a good switch up from soda.", "Not bad but nothing to get excited about. Out of 3 different V-8 Products, this one (peach mango) was the best tasting. Personally didn't notice much of an energy boost but that may be due to the fact of being a coffee drinker who also takes vitamin supplements on a daily basis. Basically this claims to be 50% juice with caffeine and vitamins added. Unlike Red Bull or other energy drinks, this didn't really give a surge of energy. Combined with the odd aftertaste, not really sure I'd be inclined to buy it over other products on the market for energy despite the addition of the juice.", "When I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2011, I had to make major changes in my lifestyle, especially what I ate and drank. The first big change was to make sugary colas a very occasional treat instead of two or three times a day (and I tried the diet colas, but I hate them). I tried low-sodium V8 vegetable juice, and I loved it, and I have one or two 8-ounce glasses a day (50 calories/10 grams carbohydrates per 8 ounces), but I still craved something sweet without too many carbohydrates. I had previously tried some of the V8 Fusion drinks, but I hadn't found a taste that really clicked with me. That changed with my first Peach Mango. It's a smooth taste with a real peach-mango flavor, very light with a pleasant aftertaste, not the overpowering artificial peach taste that some bottled drinks and flavored teas have. Considering that a serving contains equal amounts of fruit and vegetable juices, the taste is remarkably fruity with no vegetable taste at all.With only 13 grams of carbohydrates, an 8-ounce can of V8 Fusion doesn't blow my blood sugar, which is my first criterion. Like the V8 vegetable juice that I've been drinking, there's enough nutritional value to feel good about drinking V8 Fusion once or twice a day at my snacktimes. Another concern of mine is the amount of sodium in a drink, but with only 50 mg, Fusion is just fine.If I had one wish, it would be for some of the fruit and vegetable fiber to be retained, as in V8 vegetable juice (2 grams of dietary fiber per serving). But I do really enjoy the Peach Mango Fusion drink. It's a winner in my book.", "This is for someone looking for a natural energy drink. This drink has juice, vitamins, caffeine, and a just a little sugar. So it has a little something that juice itself or coffee/tea itself doesn't have, but is a blend of the two types of drinks.Drinks are all about flavor. The peach mango tastes pretty good, the blend is about even with equal amounts of peachy and mangoey flavor in my opinion. But it's a little bit bland, I just don't feel the flavor is intense enough. But that could be because it has other juices in it that dilute the flavor of peaches and mango. From the list of ingredients, it has also has sweet potato, tomato, carrot, orange and apple juices. Also despite all those juices it doesn't have any fiber in it.Overall:Pros:1) Contains vitamins including 100% vitamin C2) Only 10g of sugar and no high fructose corn syrupCons: None really.Summary: So if you want a coffee cup's worth of caffeine, juice and some vitamins, this might be a good choice. The taste is pretty fair and it doesn't have a lot of sugar, which is a good thing because some natural juice drinks have up to 4X the amount of sugar this does. I actually think this would be a hit if they sold it just as a juice drink without the caffeine, because as I said, some juices out there are so full of sugar they're undrinkable.", "If you've been waiting for a fruit juice energy drink, your wait is over. Drinking this energy drink tastes like drinking a fresh fruit juice. There's barely any hint of energy drink flavor, and a very, very slight metallic aftertaste. Other than that, it's just a fruit drink. So the tiny bit of off flavor is the price you pay for getting the energy drink kick. I guess no energy drink is perfect but this one is darn close.", "I had only juice with my breakfast this morning, so having tried this without any coffee in my system I should be able to detect the caffeine. Though I can feel a bit of a caffeine kick, I'm not so sure it has the same effect as an actual cup of coffee [that I would brew]. On the bright side, I do get a serving of fruits and veggies out of it, and it is beneficial to consume essential nutrients to neutralize the depleting effects of caffeine.The Peach Mango Fusion Energy contains fifty percent juice, of which less than only two percent is mango puree, but the flavor is unmistakable peach-mango. It's texture is ultra-smooth, with kind of a thickness that can be found in the syrup of canned peaches - it's yummy, yet thick.There are plenty of natural ingredients in V8 Fusion Energy, but it's not without its nitrates, its flavins or its chlorides. With one combined serving of fruits and veggies per can, though not the same vegetable powerhouse as V8's flagship product, Fusion is still more wholesome than other beverages in its class.With Fusion Energy, V8 brings a delicious variety to the vast selection of energy drinks available. Fusion is a great choice to balance nutrition and an upper. At about a dollar a can, when bought in twenty-fours, it's not a bad deal. It's makes for a tasty, eight ounce shot.", "Taste good but where's the energy?  This stuff definitely tastes better than the popular energy drinks.  Very fruity with a nice consistency for good mouth feel.  Fairly low calories compared to your typical soda or juice drink.  The problem is that there is really no boost in energy.  Once can has 80mg of caffeine which they even compare to an 8oz cup of coffee that has 90mg.  I don't know too many people that use energy drinks and only have 8oz of coffee at a time.  A Tall Starbucks is 12oz and a Grande is 16oz.  The only time I have drank only 8oz of coffee is when I spilled the rest of it...  I say if you are looking for an energy drink you are likely going to want one with a bit more punch to it.  If you just want a fruit drink, get a fruit drink.", "I love the taste of this fusion drink.  The peach taste does come through more than the mango, but the combination is very nice.  It was a bit too sweet for my husband, but to my taste, it wasn't as sweet as sugary sodas.  It also is not as heavy as pure fruit juice.  According to the product information, it is 50% juice, and the lightness is very refreshing.I like that there is no added sugar, which is not to say there is no sugar.  The sugars come from the fruit and vegetable concentrates.  I'm a veggie fan, but understand that not everyone likes them as I do, and the fruit taste completely obliterates any veggie taste, probably a good thing in a sweet drink.I didn't experience any significant, or even noticeable, increase in energy.  Again, according to the product information, there is more caffeine than in a diet cola but less than in a brewed cup of coffee.  To me, although this is a nice drink, it falls a bit short as an energy drink.Overall, I would get this again for a relatively healthy drink because I like it, but I wouldn't get it if I needed a quick energy boost.", "I don't doubt this is good for you, but at $1 a can, it's a little pricey. So, how does it taste -- hmmmm....welllll....it's ok, I suppose. But I don't see myself reaching for this as a thirst quencher, or craving more when I run out. It's basically like fruit juice, but with a definite whiff of vegetable. Some people will love this, for sure. But at the end of the day, there's certainly better tasting fruit juices out there, and vegetable drinks, I'm learning, just aren't my thing. This stuff is just kinda ho-hum. I can take it or leave it, and doubt I'll ever get it again.", "This product had a pleasant taste. It was not sickly sweet, and provided me with a decent pick-me- up.I think it may be a better choice than many other similar products with significantly more chemical gunk that I can't pronounce or readily identify. :-)", "\"One of the major advertised ingredients includes peach juice which I normally don't like. In the case of V8 Fusion Energy Drink, Peach Mango, I had no problems.A lot of the beverages in the \"\"added caffeine\"\" market tend to over do the sweetness factor, but also, not so in this case. Yes, it's sweet tasting. Just not overwhelmingly so.The directions to \"\"shake well before opening\"\" are buried pretty deep, so be aware that the recommended approach is to mix things up before imbibing. After chugging it down rather easily (cool but unrefrigerated) at 5am before my regular coffee, I felt the burr of a low level (for me) caffeine burst.One of the better tasting and easy drinking caffeine/fruit drinks I've ever had. Excellent in a brown bag lunch, I've ordered a case for my February lunches.\"", "I've tried a few different energy drinks in the last couple of years, largely as part of the Amazon Vine program, and this is my new favorite.  Most energy drinks do a good job hitting my body with some caffeine and waking me up, but they generally have an unpleasant bitter chemical taste.  This drink does have a little of that bitterness if you're looking for it, but mostly it tastes like peach and mango, like it promises on the can.  I drank my free sample just before I left for work, after a rough night with very little sleep, and I was impressed that it tasted so much like regular fruit juice (if it helps, I left the can in the fridge overnight, so I don't know if the taste is as good at room temperature).  By about fifteen minutes into my hour-long commute, I felt fresh and energetic - not manic or jittery, just really awake.  I never had any kind of an energy crash, and I was able to keep up all day at work.The next time I buy an energy drink, it will be this brand.", "V8 V-Fusion Energy Drink is a tasty & fairly healthy, 50% juice, energy drink which contains 1/4 cup of vegetables and 1/4 cup of fruit.

Great taste as with all the V8 products I've tried.As far as the energy?  I really didn't feel any different and I drank it after work for a boost.  May have worked but there was no caffeine buzz.  That's a good thing Martha!I will drink more of this.Thank you.MEF", "V8 Fusion Peach Mango Energy drink has a beautiful orange color, a complex flavor primarily of peach and mango, and a nice sweet-tart ratio that I really enjoyed.  The ingredients seem to be mostly reconstituted vegetable and fruit juice.
