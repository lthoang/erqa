{"reviews": ["It only takes a handful of San Francisco Salt Company's wonderful Sleep Lavender salts to turn your bath into a luxurious, relaxing spa experience. As the rose colored salts turn to a pale purple color as they dissolve in the water, the aroma of lavender rises up and smoothes out the wrinkles of a stressful day. These superb quality sea salts include the lavender essential oil, as well as vitamin E, and aloe vera, so your skin is moisturized by the oils while it is exfoliated by the salts; the results are a velvety feel to your skin, and if you don't want to take a long soak in the tub, you can add a little of the salts to your shower gel, or sprinkle some on your soapy wash cloth. You won't get the benefits of the relaxing, detoxifying soak, but your skin will still feel fabulous after your shower, and you'll have the pleasure of the aroma.San Francisco Salt Company makes a variety of high quality salts, and the health benefits are enormous. They help release the toxins your body takes in (this is especially true of us city dwellers!) and combined with the warmth of the water relaxes your muscles. And skin just glows afterwards....such a nice reward for taking that extra time to be good to yourself. I love all the San Francisco Salt Company salts I've tried, and perhaps the Sleep Lavender most of all. It's pure luxury, and feels rejuvenating and uplifts the soul. It's a sensory, tactile delight.", "I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better. One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night - it really helps feel and sleep better.  Recently I included Sleep Lavender Bath Salts from San Francisco Bath Salt Company into my routine. I love it!  The Lavender salt bath smells really nice.  I don't like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable.  It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.Note that if you don't like flowery scents, San Francisco Bath Salt Company offers other salts with different scents, for exampleMuscle Soak Bath Saltswhich smells minty.I am attaching a collage of three photos (you can locate it by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo).  The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains. The second photo shows the bag the salts came in, the salt has a light purple color.  The third photo shows salt as it begins to melt in the tub.I find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back. I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak helps to ease the headache as well.I usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag will last quite a long time.I received an evaluation bag of Lavender Salt for evaluation and an honest review. I have been using salt soaks for a couple of weeks now. In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.  I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water).  It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth.In addition to the use in the tub, I also enjoyed using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator. It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.Overall, I am very pleased with Lavender Salt and will continue to use it.Ali Julia review", "\"While I'm OK with lavender scent, I can't say it is one of my favorites, and I prefer it on a subdued level at best. Ths bath salt is a bit too strongly scented for me, even when using less than the recommended \"\"large handful\"\" for a regular bath (two handfuls are recommended for a \"\"therapy bath\"\").On the plus side, if you like a strong lavender scent, you'd be pleased with this. The lavender essential oil is pronounced and, I would imagine, of good quality to be so strong.The salts dissolved easily with no visible residue left at the bottom of the tub.I did like it much better when I followed one of the suggested product uses and tried it as a shower salt. I sprinkled some on the shower floor before turning on the water, and it felt quite nice underfoot. Sort of a massage-type feeling. Plus, the scent, when diluted with the shower water, was no where near as intense as it was in the tub. Plus, it filled the bathroom with a very nice, light scent that was better than any air freshener I've ever used.It also comes very nicely packaged in a bag with a \"\"scent button\"\" that allows you to get an idea of what it smells like before using it. Good idea!I'll give this 5 stars since I can't fault the product for my lack of a strong affinity for lavender. It does what it says it will do, and it was quite nice as a shower salt.[manufacturer provided a sample for review]\"", "Pure bath salts with essential oils in them, San Francisco Bath Salt Company has created relaxation in a bag.The packaging is fantastic. The plastic is a nearly perfect barrier; I can't smell any lavender with the bag sealed. They used a one way valve like the kind used in soft coffee packages. Squeezing the bag forces a bit of aroma out of that valve. I like the Tiffany blue color of the bag, this looks nice sitting around a bathtub.I compared this blend to the Walgreens Lavender Epsom salts. The San Francisco bath salt has a stronger lavender smell. The Walgreens salts are much less expensive and in a larger bag (although not as pretty). Where San Francisco went a little strange is the use of FD&C; coloring. In a really pure product with nice ingredients, I'm confused why they had to add coloring. There isn't enough to make the bath water noticeably red once the tub is full. In addition to the lavender oil, the salts have glycerin, Vitamin E, and Aloe Vera added. Walgreens went the just salts and lavender route. Not sure I really need those extra ingredients (oddly the other salts from San Francisco don't have these added ingredients).The salts make for a very relaxing bath soak. The aroma is pleasant. The salts do not leave a residue or oily film. I like this product a lot.I was provided a sample for review.", "Lavender is one of my favorite herbs.  I use it dried to cook with, keep little sachets of it in my folded blankets and adore lavender bath products, so I was in heaven when a bag of San Francisco Salt Company'sSleep Lavender Bath Salts 2 Lbsarrived on my doorstep.  I've found the scent of lavender better than pain killers for headache relief and a wonderful relaxer too.These bath salts are the nicest I've seen, relatively fine grained so that they dissolve easily, wonderfully scented.  And did I mention that I love the elegant packaging?I have been spoiling myself with a couple of handfuls dissolved in my footbath every evening.  You'll find other suggestions on the package - sprinkle some on your feet in the shower, then rub your feet together (nice!) or even add some to your shower gel for a body scrub.Grandma's $0.02 - I love these top-of-the-line bath salts! You will too.  Definitely Gift Worthy!", "I'm more of a shower person than a bath person, but the sleep lavender bath salts are a great product for showering as well as for tub baths. For my nighttime shower, I use a body wash that has the consistency of shaving cream. To a handful of the body wash, I added about a teaspoon of the sleep lavender bath salts and worked them together for a few seconds, then scrubbed up. Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the lavender scent was very pleasant and very relaxing.The sleep lavender bath salts package suggested several ways to use the salts, and one of them was to sprinkle the salts over wet feet and rub the feet together for a massage and foot refresher. I tried this while showering, and my feet felt wonderful, plus the soothing effects of the lavender aroma.A long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the lavender bath salts added a nice touch to the shower. Note that I've also used the San Francisco Salt Company's muscle soak product in the same way, and it's a similar experience, except with a peppermint scent instead of lavender.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.", "The first thing that came to mind when smellingSleep Lavender Bath Salts by San Francisco Salt Companywas a hotel spa.  A type sea salt, this product has a great balance of lavender scent, blended with the healing power of aloe vera and vitamin E.The manufacturer lists several great applications for this product.  A therapeutic bath can be made from a couple handfuls sprinkled and dissolved in a tub of warm water.  Sleep Lavender Bath Salts can also be used to massage gently on your skin during a shower to help exfoliate and they even suggest sprinkling a small amount on the shower floor to cleanse your feet.  The salt can also be used in your foot bath to help soften and relax tired foot muscles.  The lavender scent is invigorating, adding a nice touch to what would otherwise be an ordinary sea salt product.  I enjoyed using this product in all of the applications and experienced great relief from the relaxing power of these extraordinary salts.The luxury bag packaging makes this product perfect for gifting.  Pop a bow on, and you have the gift of a luxurious bath for that special friend or family member.Overall, theSleep Lavender Bath Salts by San Francisco Salt Companyis great for bringing a hotel spa feeling to your own bathroom.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review. A review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.", "I received a sample of Sleep Lavender Bath Salts in exchange for writing a review of the product. There's nothing I love better after a long day, than soaking in a tub with bath salts and a good book. I had to wait several weeks to have a free evening, but the anticipation was building.The package for this product is beautiful - nice enough to give as a gift to someone who needs a little pampering. I sniffed the lavender scent through the little valve on the package and decided that I couldn't put it off another night.I ran a full bath of almost-hot water and added a cup or so of the salts. It dissolved nicely and the fragrance filled the bathroom. Making sure all the kids were in bed, I got in the bath and almost melted with the decadence. The salt made the water soft and silky, and the lavender in the steam did its job relaxing me. I soaked until the water was cold, and felt so relaxed. My skin felt amazing - soft and hydrated. I slept like a baby that night!I look forward to the next time I can slip away and indulge in this lavender treat!", "This bath salt contains natural sea salt with lavandin essential oil, glycerin, vitamin E, and aloe vera leaf juice to condition and protect the skin.A handful added to a tub of hot water fills the air with the natural lavender scent, which is very calming.  A long soak soothes tired muscles and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.One of the indirect benefits of using bath salts is that they serve as a reminder and encouragement to take the time to soak in a tub for pleasure rather than having a hurried shower just to get clean.  Light a candle, turn down the lights, and listen to music for an experience that soothes the soul as well as the body.A review sample was provided by the San Francisco Salt Company.", "If Muscle Soak is my favorite, my wife's favorite is Sleep Lavender bath salt.  And why not, it smells just wonderful.  Grab a handful and throw it under hot running water which then dissolves in a jiffy.We love a hot soak in the tub specially after a long trip roadtrip (or for me, after a long day of walking when my wife decides to drag me to the mall).  Nothing soothes your aching legs better than a steaming tub of salted H2O.  After drying, my muscles feel completely relaxed.  Next thing, I just plump myself on the bed and conked out till morning.The salt comes in a classy recloseable bag. It is square with a flat bottom that I just lay it at the window sill beside my tub.I was provided a sample of this product, so I could use it and write my unbiased review.", "There's something about the fragrance of lavender that relaxes and reminds me of a field in Provence in the South of France. It's the prefect way to relax before going to sleep, in a hot bath with these San Francisco Bath Salts. I find that the fragrance lingers, even the next day. It freshens the whole room. I don't always have the time to take a long bath, and the nice thing about these bath salts is that they can be used in the shower as well. If you combine a tablespoon or so of the salts with some bath gel or liquid soap, it makes a great exfoliating shower scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft afterwards. The roughness of the salts removes old dead skin cells and my skin looks more luminous after using them. It's particularly nice on elbows and feet where there always seems to be dry skin. And just like in the bath, it makes the shower and the whole bathroom smell wonderful.  They're made with premium Pacific sea salts with pure lavender essential oil, you can tell it's the real thing.If you're not crazy about the smell of lavender, there are several other bath salts made by this company such asRose Dead Sea Bath Salts 2lb Bag,California Breeze Bath Salts 2lb BagorBubble Yum Foaming Bath Salts 2lbs. Or if you prefer something with less perfune,  you could also use theMinera Dead Sea Salt 20 Lbs Fine Grainand still get the nice exfoliating effect.Suggested usage for the bath is 2 large handfuls in a bathtub and then a 20 minute soak.  But who would limit themselves to only 20 minutes when these salts make the bath feel so luxurious? I say, 30 minutes at least. And if you have a nice glass of wine, a few lit candles and some good music playing, maybe even longer. It's nice to spoil yourself once in a while, especially after a hectic week or a rough day.  My skin felt so soft after getting out of this bath and I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.I was provided a sample of this product by the San Francisco Bath Salt Company for a fair and honest review. It was a good way to be introduced to their fine line of bath salts.", "If you like the scent of lavender, as much as I do, you will love the fragrance of these bath salts.  Aside from the wonderful scent you get the exfoliating action of genuine sea salt.  These salts make a great addition to a relaxing pre bedtime soak in the tub.  And the packaging for these salts is also quite nifty."], "A": [0.04198998957872391, 0.06983404606580734, 0.09594699740409851, 0.03825455904006958, 0.07259207218885422, 0.06578420102596283, 0.10422024875879288, 0.11999358236789703, 0.030298881232738495, 0.12230916321277618, 0.10458038747310638, 0.13419589400291443]}
