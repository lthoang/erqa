{"reviews": ["\"About time Amazon offered these instant code for the PSN cards. At first had to go to a store to buy these, then Gamestop was offering the so called \"\"instant\"\" download that took hours and hours to be emailed. Now with Amazon I get the code in seconds. Not much good right now, of course, but glad to know these are available, since I doubt anyone is gonna have their credit card stored with Sony anymore.\"", "A pre paid card. You pay money for it, use the code provided and convert into virtual currency in PSN store. Simple.", "Bought BO2 DLC with this on PSN. it does its job, and thats all i got to say about that.", "code worked without a problem.don't have to run to the store, or wait for the mail. delivery is instant! in my case I received the code in less than a minute and funded my wallet.I recommend this to anyone. buying online codes on Amazon is great..", "Great prices, definitely the best price, you save up a penny, in other places always charge you an extra% for the card, it's all here on amazon EASY AND FAST NO DELAYS OR 2 minutes", "Great value and fantastic. Convenient. It was to my liking thankfully. This is a good way to acquire funds for PSN.", "I added money to my wallet this morning via Credit Card and the wonderful Playstation Network wouldn't allow me to add any more funds.  Tried another Credit Card, same thing.  I tried all morning with no luck.So I come to Amazon, buy a PSN Card and I didn't even have to wait for an email.  There was an option to have have the code come up immediately on the confirmation page.Fast, easy and it worked.  I was able to add the funds to my PSN account and The Last of Us is downloading now.  Fantastic.", "I bought this because for some reason the PSN store would not allow me to add credit/$ cause I guess it was down or something. So I just went online and bought a 20 dollar psn card from amazon.yay", "I bought this PSN card and I got the code a few seconds later, It cost $20 with no extra fee or anything. Overall it's a great buy. I recommend", "If you have ps plus, you can get great deals with this card, unlike Xbox live where you have no deals at all.", "I like it when i can get the card from amazon and then use it on my PS3 it beats going to gamestop evertime i need something.", "I like to buy the download keys instead of having Sony have my credit card info. Seems that the less companies have your card info, the less headaches happen. With that said, Yes I trust Amazon : )", "I love buying the digital codes on Amazon, easy to use and receive them fast. My kids are always looking for Playstation funds and this is a great way to add funds to your account without using a credit card. Simple, fast, and easy to use. Highly recommend these cards.", "I love it, I love it, I love it.  I live overseas and being able to buy these things from online is great.  So easy, so good.", "Immediate delivery, outstanding product.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone needing to pick up a Playstation Network card for PSN purchases.", "I really liked being able to buy my PSN codes via Amazon. Unfortunately, I don't think you can now and I am forced to buy them from lame-stop.", "It&aacute; very easy to input the code on the Playstation Network, it's worth if you don't to spend a lot of money.", "It's so great to have online game codes, makes everything easier. i used to buy them off another website before i could find them on Amazon and that website had a $4 activation fee and the code took a while before being sent. This fixes my issue and it's for the $20 listed. Nice product. Emailing the code to other people is also a nice option.", "nothing else to say, it does what you need it for, to help you buy games in the psn store without using your credit card.", "Not much to really explain as these cards give you the added security and benefit of getting the game of your choice on the PSN without the concern you may have of giving away your Credit Card Info if you don't want to.  As a big fan of some of the early PS2 and PS1 games I missed out on I was glad to be able to get them at an affordable price on PSN and while you might not have the physical copies the games play just as well regardless. While I might not be the biggest fan of digital downloaded games it is nice being able to get some the hidden gems at these prices rather then paying a ridiculous price of hundreds of dollars or more. So if you have a PS3 and are looking for some of the classic PS1/PS2 games you missed here's a handy item to help you when selecting your games online without the burden or concern of trading your Credit card info as opposed to just giving the code.", "not much to really say other than it was it, so i did get it and it is so great !!!", "Once you submit payment, you get the network card code instantly.  Saves me the trouble of having to go to the store to pick one up.", "The code was given within seconds.

The code arrives almost instantly that you made the purchase. No problem at all", "There isn't nothing to review here. This stuff is straight forward. It is just plug in and go. No bunch of thinking or malfunctioning to worry about.", "There isn't really much to say about this product. It's an immediate type thing were they just show you the passcode. This is the actual price of the card you for what you get, for example with you were to purchase a card on PC Gamesupply they charge you a little extra, I think around 4 or 5 dollars and you have to wait aound 10 to 30 minutes to receive and email so then you can look at the code. This was on Amazon is faster and a little cheaper.", "There's not much to say here but the fact that I needed this code in order to buy a couple of games off the PSN. I got the code instantly and it worked, so I'm satisfied with this", "These are very easy to use. The codes enter real easy from the PS4 menu. I have entered a few codes so far and no problems. They are good for buying the cheaper online games PS4 offers, i.e. Tiny Brains, etc.", "This is a perfect way to buy psn cards you get if fast and it works right away. That way you dont have to use your own credit card and your information will be safe. 5 Stars!", "This is a super fast and convenient way to get credit at the Playstation store, without having to give Sony our credit card number.  Takes less than a minute to complete the order and get the 12 digit code.  Enter the code on your PS3 and you are done.  The entire process takes under 2 minutes.  It's also the best way (and only way that I can tell) to gift PSN credits.  Highly recommended if you don't feel comfortable giving Sony your info.  At the end of the sale, when you get the code, you have the option of sending a gift email right there.  Of course, you can just copy and past the code into an email as well.  Or write it down, print it and send it to someone, or whatever you want.", "Use this method it is WAY better and easier than giving Sony your credit card. Get a code and redeem it, it is that easy with amazon Online Game Codes. Even if the code is bad, for some reason, they'll check it and if you apply they'll give you a working one.", "worth it 100%, you get your code in seconds. i recommend this to people who can't buy through psn because we live in other places than USA, you have to have a usa account mandatory"], "A": [0.053080614656209946, 0.002211641753092408, 0.056815627962350845, 0.056359656155109406, 0.056197915226221085, 0.022654356434941292, 0.0027061952278017998, 0.039872560650110245, 0.05578634887933731, 0.06755311042070389, 0.020911814644932747, 0.028752868995070457, 0.025159507989883423, 0.01582907885313034, 0.029949486255645752, 0.052655138075351715, 0.005572611000388861, 0.03357000648975372, 0.046743445098400116, 0.0009419709094800055, 0.016812164336442947, 0.016076302155852318, 0.017766892910003662, 0.023288151249289513, 0.05514366924762726, 0.0205279141664505, 0.01741831935942173, 0.020328249782323837, 0.059126511216163635, 0.02548353187739849, 0.014613788574934006, 0.04009050875902176]}
