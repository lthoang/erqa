I was disappointed the case did not have any compartments inside.  My husband fixed that for me.  He went to a hobby shop and bought materials to make compartments in the case,  He would have to explain that process. I was pleased with the cosmetics assortment that came with the set.  This set is one that would be good to have in an office drawer.  A college or High School Student could also find this set very useful.The case is big enough to add shampoo, hairspray, brush, comb, other items.  It would be a great item for the extra makeup case or the portable make case, Linda W.", "This is so cool to have! I feel like a professional!
