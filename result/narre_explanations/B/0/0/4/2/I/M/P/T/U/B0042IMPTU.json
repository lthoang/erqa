{"reviews": ["Overall, Lipton Green tea is a great value and alternative if you want green tea.  It tastes pretty good and has a great price.+much more reasonably priced vs. other brands-slight bitter aftertaste (though not as bad as some brands)Overall, would recommend.", "This green tea tastes good, steeps quickly in about a minute, comes in individually-wrapped bags, and only costs about ten cents per bag.  While I also like more expensive teas, this is a fine tea at a relatively great price.  I especially appreciate the individual bags with strings to pull them out of the cup (I bought some black tea bags in a multi-pack that were just loose bags, which are a bit more work to use).", "\"I think Lipton must have been around since the Middle Ages...it was the only tea my English mother would drink...but that was the old Lipton...lately Lipton has done some great innovations, with their wonderful Pyramid White Tea flavors, and now this \"\"Rainforest Alliance Certified\"\" (look for the frog seal!) Green Tea. It's a lovely tea. Very mild. Even if you leave the bag in your cup and let it steep endlessly, you will get very little bitterness. This is a green tea even people who don't like green tea will appreciate.It's simple and refreshing, and a great after-dinner tea, as it seems to have a palate cleansing effect. And as for the frog, if tea from the Rainforest Alliance helps \"\"Improve Worker Welfare by providing safe working conditions and decent wages,\"\" among other good things, I'm all for it. Way to go Lipton!It also has 165mg of tea flavonoids (per 8 oz. serving), and every book I have read for preventing or healing cancer has stressed the importance of drinking green tea and getting  your daily flavonoids.  Thank you Lipton for this delightful tea...I am really enjoying it.\"", "Summertime is coming, and I tend to make a lot of iced green tea... and since I use 6 bags for each pitcher, this big box of teabags is just the ticket. These Lipton bags make refreshing, healthy iced tea (I make it with either honey or artificial sweetener) that is hard to stop drinking. I also occasionally use them for hot tea, and they make a nice cup; full-bodied but still light with no bitterness.", "The tea was good, tasted good. The bags are really flimsy though and fall apart so easily.  This leaves loose tea all over and who wants to drink a cup of tea leaves?", "Lipton usually can be counted on to deliver a decent cup of tea, so I had hopes that their Green Tea would perform similarly. Unfortunately this did not turn out to be the case. The cups I've tried so far have hit my palate with nothing very distinctive or even very flavorful. I realize green tea is meant to be more subtle than orange pekoe, but I find that this does little to elevate hot water much above hot water.Update: no change to what I said above, but I have adjusted the star rating to reflect that this product does make a very nice sun tea, with a refreshing delicacy and more green tea flavor when poured over ice.", "I can easily tell the differences in green tea. They each have a distinction and you can even do the blind test and tell the differences. However this has always been my fall back tea. It is inexpensive and plentiful. It is quick and easy to handle. There is an excellent after taste.Some people drink green tea for medicinal purposes. Not me; I just find it better sated for all occasions than fermented teas.So go ahead and experiment with the various teas and have fun. Just remember at the end of the day Lipton Green Tea is a good staple tea.", "Lipton tea has always been my favorite brand. Green tea is new to me, but I really enjoyed it. It has a nice mild flavor as a hot tea drink and I look forward to making iced tea too.", "The flavor of this tea is subtle and weak, even if you steep it for a long time. It's a nice, smooth flavor, but it's not great. There is no bitterness at all.  This `green' tea brews to a weak orangy/rust color. Overall, this tea is okay but I wouldn't recommend it if you prefer a strong tea.", "I really enjoyed this green tea.  It has a nice mild flavor, not grassy or strong.  I drink between 2-4 cups of green tea daily and this big box of tea is perfect for me at work.  I find that it is delicious as is with no sweetener but is also nice with a bit of honey or sugar if you like your tea a little sweeter.  The tea is 100% natural, no preservatives or other additives.  Overall, a very nice tea with smooth taste and delicate aroma.  I would definitely purchase again and suggest to my tea drinking friends.", "I always liked drinking green tea.  I always pondered about the quality of the leaves of other green teas i drink.  I trust Lipton brand and the fact that it's all natural make it confident about what i'm drinking.  I like the taste, it tastes clean. I usualy dip the bag for less than a minute.", "This package of Lipton Green Tea includes 100 tea bags and the cost per cup of tea is very low. They are the standard tea bags but they work well without the string ripping off or the bag tearing. I mention this because I have tried other tea bags that have had problems like that. I haven't had a tea bag yet that broke and caused loose tea leaves in my cup. This is just a regular green tea but it tastes good. If you are a green tea drinker then this may be a good deal for you.", "If you already like green tea, you definitely won't have a problem with this. I mainly got it because I heard it was good for you. So I will have plenty of tea to help keep me healthy, because there's 100 tea bags.  So I will be drinking tea for months to come.", "I've never been a big green tea fan. It's always been almost a herbal-like tea in flavor. It's light in color and in my opinion, light in taste. I'm a southerner and we like our tea cold, sweet and strong which wasn't usually what you got out of a green tea. Well, after trying Lipton's Green Tea, I've had a change of heart. I fixed it on the stove in a stainless steel pot like I do my regular black tea. I just get a stock pot of cold water, tie the tea bag strings to the handles with the tea bags hanging down into the water and bring it to a boil. Boil till it gets to a real good rolling boil. Turn the burner off, cover the pot with the lid and let it sit. After you tea has cooled, just pour it into your pitcher with the sweetener in the bottom. You can use sugar but I use Splenda.Perfect sweet southern tea! It tasted almost like regular tea. It wasn't weak and wasn't see-through like the bottled stuff you buy in the store. I had never tried just making green tea like a regular pot of black tea. The green tea that I had always had in the past was either bought already made or was sold in the small herbal boxes and so that's how I had fixed it, by the cup and usually hot.My southern sweet tea loving husband said it tasted fine to him and that he would drink the green tea from now on after I told him about how good green tea was for you.It was really delicious and I have a whole different opinion of green tea now.", "I have sometimes had green teas that I really enjoyed but this green tea was both greener and more bitter than theBigelow Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)which I taste tested for comparison.  A Wegman's (store brand) green tea which I also comparison tasted was more like the Bigelow green as well. I prefer both the Bigelow and Wegman green teas to this Lipton green tea.  If you like a very astringent and brighter green tea this could be a tea that you will enjoy.  I also tried it with some added white grape juice and I think it might make an OK sweetened green iced tea.A general recommendation for green teas is that they will be less bitter if brewed at about 175 F rather the just off boil range around 205 F.  I repeated the taste comparison with Lipton's green tea vs Wegmans with my wife as a second taster after  brewing at about 170 F.  We both preferred the less bitter Wegman (store brand) tea to Lipton's at the lower brew temperature as well.For the detail obsessed tea aficionado (mea culpa) I recommend an inexpensive but sturdy kitchen thermometer such asTaylor Classic Instant-Read Pocket Thermometer", "\"Lipton green tea has been a staple in this house for many years.  I've been trying out a lot of the fruit teas, but other family members prefer to stick with the teas they are most familiar with and love the best.  I was very pleased, however, to note that this tea is now Rainforest Alliance Certified and boasts their logo on the box.  In order to be certified, Lipton growers must past rigorous standards.  According to the Rainforest Alliance it \"\"is awarded to farms and forestlands that meet the rigorous, third-party standards of the Sustainable Agriculture Network or the Forest Stewardship Council.\"\"Each serving also has 165mg of tea flavanoids, something those who are interested in a healthy diet may be interested in.

I do not like other teas very much, so I decided to start simple (vs. any of the flavored green teas on the market).  This Lipton Natural Green Tea really durpassed my expectations in terms of taste and made me a convert right away.  I just sweeten it with a few drops of honey.  This package was also great - economical and just the right size to keep in my desk at work.", "I'm a huge lover of green tea, and Lipton makes a great one. I've tried other Lipton products in the past that have been sort of ho-hum (in general, I find Twinings and Celestial Seasonings to be a lot better) but Lipton green tea is really great. It has a slight bitter taste that you find in most green teas, but can be sweetened with a bit of splenda or honey. One thing I love about green tea is the health benefits. It's supposed to be good for your digestion, and without going into too much detail, I can confirm that. In my experience, it is also good for suppressing appetite. Green tea is also supposed to be good for your heart, blood pressure, etc.... I can't recommend it enough! With 100 tea bags in the box, it seems like a really great value. If you love green tea like me, this might be the perfect product for you.", "\"Lipton's Tea will make all your tea-loving friends \"\"green\"\" with envy.  It's tastes Tea-Riffic and is Guaran-Tea'd to refresh.  But, nah....It really is a quality product and well worth the money.What more can you say: healthy, zero calories, refreshing, easy-to-use and super tasty. No complaints here!\"", "\"I was in hopes that I would like this tea, but I guess I'm just too used to the \"\"good stuff\"\" (green tea leaves from specialty tea shops).

It's a quality product - the tea is a smooth flavor, not bitter.  Nice aroma out of the box before you steep the tea.  The box is the standard Lipton cardboard box, and the tea bags are individually wrapped in paper like other Lipton tea bags.Highly recommended!", "I'm really picky about my tea and coffee-Lipton's tea is usually pretty good, and their green tea is no different. It's decent both hot and when chilled and sweetened (sort of like a sobe green tea).  I'll probably end up alternating between this and their black tea.", "This tea comes in bags. (If you are a tea snob, you should have stopped reading by now.) I for one can appreciate a good cup of loose-leaf tea, but sometimes in the morning or at work, or when I am getting ready to work out I just need convenience. This tea is not the most flavorful bagged tea, but for the price it will serve. It is not as rich as, say,Tazo China Green Tip Tea, but then you are getting more tea for the money.I have never thought of Lipton as an eco-conscious company, but interestingly this is Rainforest Alliance certified. This is a great bonus for me, as I do consider myself a conscientious consumer. Considering how inexpensive this is, it is a convenient way for even the most tightly-budgeted consumers to make an environmentally-friendly choice.In conclusion, I give this four stars, not because it is the best-tasting tea, but because it is at least passable, you get a lot of tea for the money, and it is Rainforest Alliance certified.", "\"If you're looking for some simple, easy-to-make, green tea bags then this Lipton Green Tea fits the bill.While the marketing on the box says it's \"\"made of the finest leaves from around the world\"\" all I can say for sure is these tea bags deliver consistent cups of tea and the tea isn't bitter as long as you don't leave the tea bags in for too long.Like most green teas available is supermarkets in the U.S., these Lipton green tea bags are easy to deal with and simplify the process of drinking green tea for people who want the health benefits of green tea without more complicating brewing procedures. 100 tea bags for the price that Amazon charges isn't a bad deal. While I prefer Japanese Matcha green tea this Chinese-derived tea blend isn't terrible and is perfectly fine if you're just looking for a basic cup of green tea.\"", "I have a HUGE supply of team (95% of it I buy on Amazon.com). Over the years I've had  various flavored green teas and have not had pure, pristine green tea in many years. This Lipton green tea (one of their best sellers) is one of the best green teas I've ever had. It's pure, flavorful green tea. I often put sweeteners in tea, but with this one I found  a quick squirt of honey is enough and wonderful. I also had some cups without any sweetener and it was highly flavorful and satisfying. This tea can be enjoyed any time of the day. I tried having it first thing in the morning, mid day and at night (not too late because it does have some caffeine in it). This is good, pure, high quality green tea. What's NOT to like?", "\"I'm going to get a head start on the reviewing process. Lipton Green Tea is, in a word, \"\"awesome\"\". It has a great flavor and it makes for a great iced tea. Normally, I'm not a fan of hot tea, but with this tea I make an exception. Although I know that pretty much ANY hot liquid will do the trick, I particularly enjoy a cup of hot green tea when my allergies are flaring up and have what feels like a semi jammed up my nose. This stuff really helps to open my head up. The fact that it's actually GOOD for you (or \"\"better for you\"\" as opposed to say, black tea) is just an added bonus.\"", "This green tea is OK, but I prefer black tea. This just didn't have much taste. I did add a sweetener, but still just tasted too bland to me.", "\"Personally, I don't find green tea all that tasty. There's one brand I like,Choice Organic Premium Japanese Green Tea, 16-Count Box (Pack of 6), but I don't think it tastes good enough to pay more for. I drink plenty of roasted green tea (same brand) and Kukicha (green twig tea) because I find them more flavorful. However, my husband drinks plenty of green tea. He puts sweetener and lemon in it, so, for him, the flavor is not that important. He's interested in what he considers the health benefits of the drink.So, I got the (free) box of Lipton green tea. He's had two cups and says \"\"it tastes the same as what I usually drink.\"\" What's that? Whatever's on sale.  So, it's not great, and it's not bad. I've had bad tasting green teas. This is not one of those. It's your average \"\"American green tea.\"\"Now, I do have questions about the green frog on the package. What is the Rainforest Alliance and what does their certification mean? I actually went to the trouble of looking at their website, and it's pretty complex. I admit I did not have the patience to read everything to understand what this certification means. It looks like a good certification, and who wouldn't be for anything that helps preserve the rainforest? Unilever (the world's largest food company) owns Lipton, and I must admit that concerns me a little bit, along with the \"\"100% natural\"\" label. What on earth does \"\"100% natural\"\" mean in a green tea? Is there really some green tea that isn't? All these things seem to simply be a bunch of advertising that is meant to make people feel warm and fuzzy about their buying choices.As I said, I got this tea free. I'm glad I did, because I did not know that Lipton was owned by Unilever and I hadn't asked myself the question \"\"what does 100% natural mean?\"\"I'm not going to answer that question here. This is, after all, a tea review. For that, this tea gets three stars. It's fine, and if Lipton (and Unilever) are indeed doing anything that might be a step in the direction of more sustainable agriculture, that's good.\"", "Iced tea is one of my very favorite beverages. In fact, I brew a fresh pitcher just about every day, year-round. Recently, after reading about the health benefits of drinking more green tea, my husband and I made the switch. Our first few attempts with other brands were rather disappointing: they tasted stale, somehow, or so weak as to not really taste like tea at all.When the chance came to try Lipton's Green Tea for free via the Amazon Vine Program, I jumped at it. If we didn't like it, I figured, what would be the harm since we weren't out a dime, right? And, honestly, since I'm not a fan of Lipton's regular tea, I didn't expect to like this one much. Wow, was I wrong.This is a pleasantly-flavored green tea that possesses both that lovely scent and slight tang one expects with any good green tea. The flavor was quite fresh, and yet bold enough that it actually tasted like tea, and not just tea-colored water. Unlike several other brands that package their tea in flow-through bags, Lipton's didn't allow a lot of sediment to come loose, so we didn't get that nasty sludge at the bottom of the pitcher.Both my husband and I prefer our tea unsweetened, and this tea tasted wonderful served that way. My neighbor prefers her tea sweetened, and after adding her standard amount of sugar she was surprised to learn this was green, and not black, tea.We'll be buying our own at the store now, but thanks to Lipton and Amazon for letting us try it for free!", "I am a avid team drinker, and am trying to work into my diet more green tea. I was very pleased with this product offering from Lipton. It has a good, mild flavor, and makes both a nice cup of either hot team or a refreshing glass of iced tea.This is a simple, well made satisfying product that I offer you would probably enjoy as well.", "\"I have just recieved a 100 count box of this green tea and immediately took out six of the convenient bags and put them into the holding-trap of my Japanese-style terra-cotta pottery teapot and poured nearly boiling water into the cool un-pre-heated pot -- in order to get about a proper brewing temp. After a few minutes, I tried this green tea with some brown sugar and just a bit of concord grape / acacia juice to mellow the typical bitter [hops like] undercurrent of green teas. After a few cups from very hot to just warm to just cool, I can verify this \"\"Lipton Green Tea\"\" as being pretty tasty and good -- about as good as many more expensive green teas. Even if you are somewhat more of a black tea drinker [like me], you may like this modest green tea -- especially via ways to *mellow the bitter* -- like adding sugar, honey, a bit of fruit juice or even some crushed Altoids -- all ways I have used with various green teas -- and will with this one +++\""], "A": [0.037404440343379974, 0.022966166958212852, 0.014995844103395939, 0.014767413027584553, 0.047535985708236694, 0.028887882828712463, 0.0270070843398571, 0.050901781767606735, 0.046624187380075455, 0.031095631420612335, 0.02244405448436737, 0.028483740985393524, 0.04469229653477669, 0.03018988110125065, 0.018128594383597374, 0.004442479927092791, 0.05039222911000252, 0.02951211854815483, 0.019833974540233612, 0.02759654074907303, 0.026729775592684746, 0.02943550795316696, 0.05452469736337662, 0.008288659155368805, 0.03644778952002525, 0.041148945689201355, 0.030961010605096817, 0.04175882413983345, 0.03477877750992775, 0.041923172771930695, 0.046712975949048996, 0.009387538768351078]}
