{"reviews": ["My son actually tried this product for his eczema, I don't know if it because eczemais really bad he may need to see a doctor but it didn't work for rashesbut it works for irritated skin especially likemosquitos bumps, I used it for thatwhat I also like its very lite not a strong fragrance", "My son suffers from seasonal mild eczema.  We have used Eucerin products (especially the tubs of Original Moisturing Creme, and the tubes of Calming Creme) in the past to treat it, and have come to rely on this brand.This new Eczema Relief Body Creme is also working well for us.  It is a very rich, thick lotion, which is easier to apply than the ointment-like Original Moisturizing Creme).  My son says it feels soothing on his broken, rashy skin.  He does not complain of stinging or burning like he with some products.  His skin looks healthier within 24 hours.I also like this product for myself, for extreme dry skin.  It doesn't absorb very quickly, so I save it for nighttime use.", "Eczema Relief Body Creme by Eucerin is a good product.  Its texture is quite thick and a little bit goes a long way, so this 8 oz. tube will last for at least a year.  I noticed a slight tingling sensation upon application and it lists Colloidal Oatmeal 1% as the active ingredient, but I suspect this is due to the Ceramide-3 and/or Licochalcone.  It claims to be steroid-free and it is unscented, something I really like.One improvement I've noticed is that it relieves itchy skin.  However, it contains mineral oil and that may be problematic for some users.  Also, Eucerin doesn't claim that this cream is non-comedogenic, so apply sparingly and only in places where clogging isn't a potential issue.Overall, I found this cream effective, though oily and heavy.  It doesn't take much to relieve itchy, flaky skin and the relief is long-lasting.  I wouldn't use this as a moisturizer per se, but as a supplement for problem skin, particularly re. eczema or other related issues where topical treatment is desired.Recommended.", "This is a thick and rich creme, which is good for moisturizing dry skin, but it did not help my eczema at all. At least it did not make it worse like some other products.", "Eucerin Body Cr&egrave;me, Eczema Relief does just what it says. It relieves itch and works really well. There is no fragrance, dye or steroids in it. It is a rich mixture, almost the consistency of toothpaste and it rubs in quickly. I have prescription cr&egrave;me is that not as soothing as this one. In fact, to tolerate the prescription cr&egrave;me, I have to add petroleum jelly. I recommend this product.", "I have been applying Eucerin Body Creme to the dry, itchy patches on my daughter's skin. She has 3 different types of skin allergies from childhood, including eczema, and allergic dermatitis. This creme does not burn, is gentle and is fragrance, dye, and steroid free. I also tested this creme on my own skin, which is extremely dry from Arizona's intense heat. In addition, I have applied this creme to my dad's dry skin in the past, for relief of itching. None of us had any complaints. In comparison to several other cremes I've tested over the years for severe dry skin, Eucerin products have been in favor for eczema relief. I would purchase in the future to help protect and relieve dry skin irritation, and itching. Recommended!", "I have a bit of eczema on my leg, and while the product was moisturizing on my hands and legs, I didn't find a difference in making my eczema better. It didn't make it any worse, though. The product was okay, but it is very thick. I found that it soaked in well and didn't leave a residue.", "Seems like the older I get the more my skin needs extra moisturizing.  This body creme has no odor, which I like, and it's very thick. After you massage it in, it leaves your skin feeling softer and the effect lasts for hours.  I like it, and I'll be buying more when it runs out!", "This is great for eczema. Non irritating, fragrance free and long lasting. Goes on thick and creamy and lasts a long time. Really happy with this. Works as well if not better than the prescription stuff and is a lot cheaper than what you get for RX cost. Will definitely buy more of!", "I don't suffer from eczema.  I do suffer from combination skin.  My arms are fine, but my elbows are dry. My legs are fine but my ankles are dry.  My upper arms get dry where my short sleeves rub.  But I also live in Florida where it's very humid but somehow I still have these dry area's that get itchy.Eucerin works.  It moisturizes my dry spots but doesn't make me itchy or greasy.  There was no detectable smell in my opinion.  I did not smell the product from the bottle but instead smelled my skin after application.  No smell.  Also no stains on my bedding, since I apply before sleep, this is important to me.", "\"I really like how thick and emollient this lotion is.  When I've used it, it helps soothe my irritated skin right away, and helps calm the redness down.Because it is so thick, however, I have to be careful with where and how I apply it; if my eczema is acting up on my hands, I have to apply this sparingly to the affected areas or else risk having greasy hands for awhile.The ingredients are also designed to build your skin's barrier, and the ceramides are supposedly very effective for that.  Another reviewer commented on the strong scent, but, to me, it really is fragrance-free.  It is also free from steriods and dyes, and doesn't contain parabens.While I really like how well this works, I'm  not sure if I'll continue to use it since one of the main ingredients in it is mineral oil, which I try to avoid since my experience has been that it's a cheap filler that, while it works well to keep moisture in the skin, still doesn't feel as \"\"breathable\"\" to me as other occlusive agents.Amazon isn't including the ingredient list, but I'm copying it here from the Eucerin website:*  Active Ingredients: Colloidal Oatmeal 1.0%*  Inactive Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mineral Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Palmitate, PEG-40 Stearate, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Ceramide 3, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid.\"", "I've been looking for a replacement for a dead sea product that I cannot find anywhere and I loved by Crystalline. This is pretty good because it's creamy and has an almost undetectable fragrance. Still, for my purposes I'd like more emollients and the healing benefits of sea salt from the dead sea would make it perfect.", "I've used Eucerin Eczema Relief cream for a week now, and I really like it.  It's fragrance free, absorbs quickly, it's very moisturizing, and it keeps my skin hydrated 24 hours.  I like that it's richer than a lotion, but not as heavy as some of the cremes that come in pots.  Especially in summer, I don't need quite as much moisturizing, and this cream is perfect.I have a small patch of eczema on one elbow, and it's noticeably better after just one week of daily applications of this cream.  I like that it's fragrance, dye and steriod free, and that it contains oatmeal.My favorite all-time moisturizer is still CeraVe, but Eucerin is a close second.", "In my household Eucerin is a trusted brand.  For years, I have purchased their products, specifically Aquaphor, since my son suffers from seasonal eczema. Usually when the seasons change, his allergies will flare which means dry, itchy skin. Typically I have used Aquaphor, but when this product was offered for review, I had nothing to lose, and I'm glad I tried it. I thought it was extremely soothing (I put some on right out of the shower) and moisturizing. I really liked it.  Why?This lotion comes out like a thick cream, but when you rub it in, it feels light and leaves the skin feeling soft. It definitely soothes dry, itchy skin. You can use it on your entire body, but I found that it was perfect for scaly heels, elbows, and knees.  The bottle boosts claims that there is oatmeal, ceramide-3 and licochalcone, which from a layman's perspective just means soothing. There is no real scent. The product doesn't leave your skin feeling or looking greasy/oily. **And for those who are use to purchasing Eucerin or Aveeno products, the price of this lotion will seem reasonable, especially if it does all that it promises. In conclusion, my family and I will probably need to use this product over time (longer) to determine its long term benefits, but as of today, we are pretty satisfied.", "Eucerin is a well-known product and for the most part, performs well. This cream is no different. It last a long time and isn't greasy like other products. I highly recommend this cream for those suffering from excessive dry skin.", "I really like this lotion. I have very dry feet and most product either are to weak or are super greasy and make my feet itch worst then before I put anything on. Eucerin's Eczema relief is great as it is strong, reduces itch, absorbs quickly and don't leave that greasy sticky feeling. Great!", "Wow, really like this creme.  It's very soothing to irritated skin, and it is very moisturizing.It goes on waxy.  At least at first.  But then it leaves your hands soft with a slight sheen.  The place I usually test lotions is on my elbows and hands, and right before I started using this creme my hands were mess.  Itchy, because I'm slightly allergic to dish soap, and very dry, because I've had a lot of pots to scrub lately.After 3 days I noticed a huge difference.  My palms weren't as itchy, and the back of my hands look moist and younger.  (If you're an old gal like myself, you know what I mean about how the back of your hands can look older than the rest of you.)No fragrance to speak of.  This Eucerin product didn't irritate my skin (which is easily irritated) nor did it seem to wash and wipe off too easily.  And because it also didn't make my face break out, it's likely to be my Winter lotion.", "\"Our daughter has quite an eczema problem and so was glad to try this product. She says it's quite easy to use and quite economical. It gives her \"\"some\"\" relief, about what she gets from other, similar non-prescription products.And that's the real issue. This product is good if you don't have a very significant or serious eczema problem. It will deal with minor flare-ups and the like. But for anything more, what you can get in a non-prescription cream is only going to go so far. You will (as you already know) have to deal with doctors and prescription medicines.The limited relief that this cream offers isn't, in a way, the fault of the product, because the manufacturer can only do so much within the limits of non-prescription strength remedies. But I do rate the product 4 stars instead of 5, not because it isn't good within the limits that can't be avoided, but because it's over-hyped.\"", "Unfortunately this is what my face looks like right now.  Had had eczema in the past, but what I have now is a version of hives that was instigated by a bug bite.  So I tried this cream hoping to calm my complexion down.  Think this stuff is wonderful, and the formula is a very rich gel cream that is highly emollient.  My skin is very dry, so I'm not advocating use on the face for all because after this is labeled as a body creme.  But I've been ignoring labels for years and have found that creams for the hands or body are just as good for the face and best of all they are far more economical.  You get more cream/lotion for less money.I first used the original Eucerin creme as a kid when I had eczema.  That cream was soothing but it was extremely thick and hard to distribute.  In fact it was more like a paste.  Eucerin has stepped up its game with this new line of products.  Note this cream is dye, fragrance and steroids free.  That's good but must admit I did find this to be slightly irritating upon initial application.  Like to apply this mixed with olive oil, which has excellent anti-inflammatory properties.", "I have been plagued off and on by spots of dermatitis for years. They come and go, and I've used all sorts of medications and treatments to try to get rid of it. These range from simple things like sensitive skin soap, wash, and detergent to corticosteroids prescribed by my doctor. This Eucerin creme is sort of a mid-way between those and I find it works fine for maintenance. It does not, however, help much with actual healing of the skin.First off, I've also used Eucerin face wash along with those sensitive skin agents which include (but aren't limited to) the sensitive versions of Tide, Dove, Neutrogena, and Cetaphil. I've also tried Neosporin Eczema face wash. To be honest, I never noticed any difference from using these and have since gone back to cheaper regular soaps and detergent. Apparently this isn't the cause of my particular irritation.Stepping up a bit in terms of both expense and hassle are these body creams. I've used some regular moisturizers like Lubriderm and Dove, which sometimes help a bit. However they also sometimes irritate the skin if it's in bad enough shape. I've tried adding Benadryl when this got bad enough, but it seems a bit too strong at times and of course means I need to apply two things. This Eucerin creme does double duty in this regard- soothing itching and also moisturizing. I've also used Neosporin Eczema Essentials which does very much the same thing, and have found the Eucerin to be the better of the two. It does a good job of moisturizing and relieving itching; the Neosporin is a good moisturizer but I find it doesn't do much about itching unless you use the cortizone cream in conjunction with the supposedly anti-itch moisturizer.I should note though that this is still no substitute for prescription ointments, especially when it comes to reversing skin damage. For that I've had desonide and fluocinonide prescribed, and nothing works faster or better for actual healing. It instantly relieves itching and can repair skin in as quickly as two days. The downside to these corticosteroids is they can have a pretty bad 'rebound' effect where after some use, if you stop using them it can actually get worse than it was before, causing the whole cycle to start over. I've found that the hardest thing to deal with is itching when the skin repair is finished.That's where the creams like this Eucerin come in. I've found that it works very well to use the prescription stuff for a few days, then when the skin is no longer inflamed start dropping the amount and using the cream instead. It's still hit-and-miss as far as actually curing the spot goes, but it's the best way in my experience. As far as the Eucerin itself goes, it's still necessary to apply at least twice a day- I've found that one treatment in the morning isn't quite good enough for the whole day. The one big downside I've found to this cream is it's pretty thick and feels that way when you put it on. It's definitely not one of those 'invisible moisturizers' and is both quite visible in a mirror and has an oily feeling. But I still would recommend it since it simply does what you want it to do. It also sticks pretty well even if it comes into contact with clothing, which quite a few other products don't."], "A": [0.06317673623561859, 0.026848038658499718, 0.010784811340272427, 0.06298064440488815, 0.051474761217832565, 0.04952085390686989, 0.060029301792383194, 0.05851211026310921, 0.06117404252290726, 0.055179428309202194, 0.007769392337650061, 0.059351883828639984, 0.04241456463932991, 0.05011361092329025, 0.05948689579963684, 0.06114170700311661, 0.061334576457738876, 0.060480423271656036, 0.05004212632775307, 0.04818407818675041]}
