{"reviews": ["I've been a big Skylanders fan since the first game Spyro's Adventure. To this day it's still magical picking up a character and setting them on the portal and watching them appear in the game.Swap Force is still magical but now with the ability to take certain characters apart (in half) and attach them to other halves of characters creating new and unique characters. Pretty cool addition to the franchise.Game play is largely the same, although the ability to jump has finally been added. Puzzles are still fairly simple, but this is geared towards kids after all so that's expected. Great story, characters and level design make for some fun/addictive gameplay.Lots of good things to say about this game really, why the 4 stars? Well, simple the cost. To really experience all there is for the game you'll need additional characters - and they come at a cost. ten to fifteen bucks per character although you can save a little bit with 3 packs it can quickly add up. So it's a love hate relationship with those.If you have played either of the other two you know exactly what to expect. Still an amazingly charming game and lots of fun.", "THE SKYLANDERS CAN FINALLY JUMP!...sorry, I'm just still excited over them finally being able to do such a simple action. It only took three games!Skylanders Swap Force initially didn't seem like a full game to me. Giants had only been out for a while, and from the first couple of gameplay videos I saw, it looked like a big expansion pack with a few new characters and a new mechanic rather than a full fledged sequel. Fortunately for everyone, Swap Force may be the best Skylanders game yet. Not only can you finally jump(!) but the swap mechanic is actually fun and adds a bit of depth to the game with how your character plays. There are tons of different combinations you can make with the characters here, so much to the point where I actually tried every combination with the figures that we have. If you were a little underwhelmed by Giants, Swap Force may be just what you need.The game plays a lot like the previous games. It's the same style of action game where you collect treasures, blast enemies and try to stop Kaos. You can upgrade abilities and attacks, though now with the Swap Force characters, you can upgrade the top and bottom portions individually! The game may be designed for kids, but it's great to see a developer putting time and effort into making a game of this quality for the age group. Here I was just talking about that in the Smurfs 2 game review I did a few weeks ago- many games for kids (or all-ages) are dumbed down and too basic. The Skylanders games don't fall into that category. Level design in this installment is much more diverse than we're used to. As you, the Portal Master, level up, new features and options are unlocked. Basically, everything that was fun in the first two games is back, just spruced up. Secret items and areas can be very tricky to find this time around too. If you're the kind of person who enjoys finding everything in a game, you'll be pretty busy with Swap Force.Important things to keep in mind before purchasing:-ONLY the Swap Force Skylanders can use the swap ability-your old Portal of Power can't read the Swap Force Skylanders-all your old Skylanders and Skylanders Giants figures DO work with this game and its new Portal-you can kiss your money good bye if...no, -when- your kids really get into it!The visuals, music and voice acting are top notch. I'm constantly impressed by the soundtrack for these games. While it may not be anything to put on a 'greatest game soundtracks' list, it's definitely memorable.What more needs to be said? Fans of the franchise will love this game. I just hope that in the next one, a run/dash ability for all Skylanders is implemented. That and we get a huge world to explore with double the length of this one. Still, Swap Force is a hit!", "I got this for my daughter who played the previous versions, and she loves it.  She even went out and got an additional character for the game.  The game comes with a couple of figurines and a base unit.  I watched my kids play it for a while and can see how they would enjoy it.  Graphics are a notch above some WII titles I've played and the sound is good.  I think it is safe to say if you like the other skylander games you'll like this one too.", "This is my first experience with Skylanders, so here's my random observations...- Your character is SLOW.  Holy smokes.  SLooooooW.  I swapped the Octopus guy top with the fireball guy's bottom and made a guy that has jet legs with a gun and sword.  If you hold down the C button, he powers up and then flies around at a slightly faster clip by using the jet legs.- There is some kind of chip in each toy that stores it's information!  Very cool!  You can level them up, and it stores it in the actual toy!  Not sure if there is a way to 'reset' the toy.  They have no buttons or switches or batteries or anything.- Wow.  You can earn/buy hats in the game, and they give you different abilities, or better stats rather, but they look AWFUL.  Really, a stone crusher robot dude in a pimp hat?  A dragon wearing a coonskin cap?  The awful part is that they not only don't fit the 'environment', they also don't fit.  Literally.  They just kinda hover over your head.  It might be better if they were built around each character design, and molded to each different head.  As is, they look...dumb.- Some of the figures light up!  Very cool!  Different color LEDs light different parts of the toys.  Awesome.  The toys have a really great design too.  Nice artstyle, but also well sculpted.- The Swap Force toys are well made too.  They have two small, but powerful magnets inside their waist, and then you basically snap them off at the belt line and swap the tops around.  It works well and feels like a high quality build.- TONS of stuff to collect.  Like...TONS.  Fun to relax with, good goals for kids, fun variety, etc.- TONS of voice work.  Every Skylander talks and pretty much every major voice actor in the industry voices someone in the game. BUT you can't skip much of the talking.  Sometimes, you can press '2' to skip, but not often enough.- Save points are in weird places.  The levels are kinda long for what they are, so you're looking at twenty minutes or more between save points.  Not cool.  I had to watch a long, unskippable cinematic twice even when I quit out of the hubworld.  Lacks polish.- TONS of stats, information, codes, add-ons, etc.  I still don't understand it all, but you can also just mess around and blow through the game (like a small child might enjoy doing), so none of it is really mandatory.- The cord on the portal is kinda short.  It's probably 8-10' long, and plugs into the back of the Wii.  I have to sit on the floor by the TV to play... not super comfortable.  The first game, two years ago, came with a wireless portal, but I couldn't ever get it to work.  This one works, but you would think they could have nailed down the wireless format in the past few years.  Clearly, this is less of an issue for children, but should be noted.- I'm assuming you could get through the whole game with only one character, but you'd miss A LOT of content.- I was in an 'air' section with an 'undead' figure.  He was issuing 39 hit points per hit.  I swapped to the recommended 'air' character, and it went up to 59 hit points per hit.  I swapped to an 'mountain' giant and he issued 70 hit point per hit.  The Giants have cool figures, cool moves, do more damage, why not just play as a giant the whole time?- You end up swapping figures on the portal a lot.  Some of it makes sense, entering a forest for 'life', or water for...'water', but sometimes you'll pass something and it'll go into dialog and change the 'effective element' (ie. best tool for the job), so you swap your dudes, and then when the dialog is done and you take another step, it turns out you need a different element unless you're entering the door you just passed (for example).  It probably takes less than ten seconds to 'boot up' your new character, but its still a little annoying.  And man, this game LOOOOVES the 'Undead' element.  Expect to break that dude out quite a bit.- Some areas cannot be reached, but the game doesn't explain why.  For example, you might see a chest on a short ledge, but cannot jump high enough to reach it.  I'm assuming at some point your character can level up, or have a higher jump or something.  I tried Spyro himself and couldn't reach it.- The graphics are a little meh.  The environments are nice, but everything is pretty jaggy.  Maybe I just haven't used the Wii in a while compared to the Xbox 360 or PS3.- It comes with three 'elements' - life, fire and water.  There are eight elements in the game, and also 'giants' AND also different bases on the SwapForce characters, so... I'm guessing at least 17 different characters are needed to open everything.  Wait, not everything because some gates are sealed by two elements, by using swap technology.  So... I guess if you buy all your elements in Swap Figures (which are more expensive), and a Giant, then maybe you could open everything?  I just counted, and the game menu lists 16 Swap Force figures. Besides the cost of the game, I'm guessing you're in about $100 in figures just to get all the elements.  Now is a good time to buy if you're not picky about which characters you get though, because all the old Giants and figures from the first series seem to be on a fire sale at many retailers.  I got two figures from the 'Giants' set (but not actual giants) for a total of $6 at TRU this week because of a fire sale.  I'm not picky about characters though.  ALSO, some characters are more 'rare' than others, so they cost more (if you are picky) and used game chains don't carry used figures because 'someone might have put them in water' is what I was told by a store associate at GS.  Isn't that true of all cartridges?Overall, a great idea for a game.  I wish the gameplay were a bit tighter, maybe it is on the Xbox or PS3?  The premise is great, obviously it can become a huge money pit, but its fun to play and mess with the figures.  Ultimately, I found myself longing for the play mechanics from Ratchet & Clank and it would be a home run.", "When the Skylanders reincarnation of Spyro legend surfaced a few years back, it introduced a new concept in gaming - a series of collectible character action figures that drop into the game when placed on a &#34;portal&#34; that plugs into your console.  Each character had unique strengths depending on whether they were water-, fire-, magic-based, etc. Sure, you could play the game with only one or two characters, but you'd find that certain areas of the map were restricted to only certain classes of characters and that some challenges would be very much so without possessing the right mix of attributes. The cynical complained that this was just the latest ploy to further monetize your game purchase, somewhere between enticing and requiring you to buy more  and more of these action figures at $10 - 15 each.Skip ahead to today, and that cynicism may be proving to be true.  The original Skylanders was followed up with the Giants sequel (with larger action figures and in-game characters).  And now the latest version is SWAP Force, with action figures that separate in the middle (via magnets) so that the top and bottom halves of different characters can be combined to create new powerful combinations to use in the game.  Completists will be about knee-deep in Skylander action figures at this point!Much more so than the Giants sequel, SWAP Force provides some real innovation.  The ability to combine different attributes really increases the players' versatility in how to solve in-game puzzles or to defeat previously insurmountable bosses.  It's also humorous fun, particularly for kids who enjoy seeing their Frankensteinian creations come to life on the screen.  Note that your older action figures will work with the SWAP Force game (although obviously can't be part of the mix-and-match fun).The game itself will be familiar to anyone who's played any other game in the series:  chapter-based 3D platforming with puzzles to solve, mini-games to play, tons of Easter eggs to find, and button mashing combat.  The fighting is all bloodless and no one ever visibly dies - bad guys typically evaporate into some magical flashes when defeated; if your character takes too much damage, he/she will need to be exchanged for another action figure (with an on-screen message that he/she needs to &#34;rest&#34; for a while until you can join him/her back into the game).  The overall mental and dexterity requirements of the game are best for 10 and up, but even younger kids could play when teamed up with an older player.  Teamwork is emphasized throughout, with many of the puzzles and mazes being more easily solved when two players work together.  The SWAP Force game also provides some overdue fixes to the Skylanders formula, with smoother, easier, more intuitive controls (they can finally jump!).If you're on the fence about whether or not your family would enjoy the world of Skylanders, note that you can now find the earlier games and their figures on pretty good sale.  However, you'll be missing out on the fun of mixing and creating new characters with the SWAP Force capabilities.  This is a series that continues to improve upon its proven formula while also providing creative innovations in the right places.", "I got this for my 6 and 7 year old boys. The have the skylanders giant game and absolutely love it. This game adds new characters with the ability to switch their tops and bottoms to create new characters. This game is fun to play and not to difficult for them. I'm not saying that it is to easy though. It does offer them some challenges. I also love the new portal as the top is more open and doesn't have the raised edges so you can fit the larger characters on better.  Overall a really fun game that is a great addition to this series. You can also use your older figures which is a plus. Only downside is your kids want all the new figures which can get very expensive.", "We have been Skylanders fans since the first iteration of the game, and I can easily say this one is the best yet. The graphics are a clear improvement, and while they retain the colorful, family-friendly vibe, the environments have received a fair bit of realism that really adds to the experience. The music also seems far more varied this time around and builds on an already enjoyable (if not forgettable) soundtrack with a number of melodies from certain areas that are hauntingly beautiful.The most important part, however, is the gameplay. I have always played the Skylanders series with a large group of family and friends, including my 8-year-old son who happens to be my main gaming buddy. While we've loved all the Skylanders games, Swap Force adds even more co-op into an already co-op heavy game. The door puzzles which were once single player are now fully two-player, and even more fun with two. The mini games that were also once single player are now two-player as well, making the entire game seamlessly multiplayer from start to finish, with no one feeling left out and no arguing about who gets to play Sky Stones this time! I really loved this aspect of the new game and is easily my favorite among all the new features.The kids' favorite feature is clearly the ability to swap the characters and create new and unique characters. The upper part of the character determines your actual abilities, while the base gives you a single special ability, like faster movement. So you can continue leveling up your favorite &#34;top&#34; piece while switching out the bottom pieces to suit your needs. The kids absolutely loved filling in the in-game grid of all the swap possibilities. They also quickly memorized all the names and burst into fits of giggles when they manage to find a particularly silly sounding name. It's added a whole new level to gameplay and makes the figures far more interactive than they used to be.As always, the old characters are all usable here, too. Even though they can't gain any new levels with Swap Force, it's still fun to bring out the old favorites. We've been finding ourselves picking up the newer &#34;poses&#34; of the older characters just to be able to level them up again. It's definitely a money grab, but the characters are so much loved by everyone that I don't see it as any different than collecting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barbies, which are easily just as much (and more) expensive than the individual Skylanders. I noticed this year they're even bringing out physical play sets for the Skylanders, which may be an even further expansion into physical play with the toys.One thing I was concerned about was that Giants would be forgotten with this game. No one really picked the Giants unless they had to because of the way they lumber around at a snail's pace, but I was happy to see they've added some parts to the game which still require the Giants, so they are sure to feel useful in the new game as well.Overall it's been a really fun experience to enjoy with the family. There are a lot of really cool new characters this time around. With Giants, we were &#34;ho hum&#34; about a few of them, but we love all the new additions to the Skylanders family, especially some of the new lightcores like Smolderdash and Star Strike. The only complaint I have about this game is the amount of storage required to house all the Skylanders! I just picked up the door hanging storage system for half off at the big giraffe toy store, and it easily holds all our Swap Force characters so far and frees up a ton of space, so I highly recommend that at the sale price!", "\"My kids, aged 22 and 20 play this game with their friends when they all come home from college.  When this new version came out I didn't hesitate to get it.  I haven't had any issues with it freezing or with it not working so I can't really testify to the issues others are having with their game.  I do know that the kids really enjoy playing the game and using the different interchangeable pieces.  I will say that it is pretty easy to \"\"beat\"\" the game at their ages, but my nieces who are 7 and 9 years of age are way more challenged by the game.  I guess my advice would be to get this for your young ones and don't be surprised when the \"\"big\"\" kids take over!\"", "The new portal is attractive, and you can put multiple Skylanders on at a time.  The max I had was two skylanders and one sidekick.  The play through is like the first two skylanders games which makes it AWESOME, but some of the portals have mini games now, some require element combos (swapables with two different elements or even two players of two separate elements)  I love this game.  I want all the skylanders.", "The console versions of Skylanders have finally caught up with the 3Ds versions that have had jumping from the first version.  The meaning of the jump button in gaming history can't be overstated and it really adds to the challenge as do the even harder levels and leveling capabilities of figures.  The story is just good enough as are the graphics at least on the Wii version look dated to be kind.  Gameplay however is quite good reminiscent of the first 3ds version.  The controls are very smooth and leveling your characters is as addictive as always.  I don't know that many of the new characters (series 3) look as cool as the old ones but the included figures are a nice selection of powers and animations.  The new power portal is sleeker and still USB powered.  The swapable component seems a bit gimmicky but the kids some to have fun switching them (fingers can get pinched as the magnets are strong).  I can't compare this to the Disney Infinity game as I haven't tried it yet but Skylanders has us dusting off our old figures and playing them again so the game has yet to lose its charm.", "I'm not a fan of games/toys/items that upgrade simply to get more money. For example are all iphones really that different? The are usually just small little upgrades that aren't honestly THAT different from the previous incarnation.SWAP force doesn't feel like an upgrade, more like an extension on the adventure! The fact that you can use your previous Skylanders is a bonus and takes a bit of the sting out of having to buy a new portal.Once again, though, I found myself buying a few more Skylanders as we wanted to access other parts of the game. The good news is that it wasn't too bad as we already had quite a few Skylanders!We had tons of fun playing this but the gameplay didn't take too long for a 12 year old video game lover. For younger children I'm sure it would take longer! But it is fun and even as a grown-up I loved the game!", "If you love the Activision Game Skylanders, then you will continue to love the new expansion/sequel Skylanders SWAP Force. The Skylander SWAP Force Wii Starter Kit comes with The Skylanders Game, 3 skylanders. Blast Zone and Wash Buckler which can swap the tops and bottoms, and a New Version of the popular character Stealth Elf called Ninja Stealth Elf. The Starter pack also includes a Character Collection Poster, 3-Sticker Sheets with Secret Codes and 3-Trading Cards.All Skylanders have different powers and will be essential to use at different points in the game just like the previous Skylander games. This is an excellent introductory into the Skylanders world as character from the original game and Giants are compatible in the Swap Force game, and if you or your child loves Adventure/Platform games then Skylanders is a must own!"], "A": [0.08450193703174591, 0.0007192284101620317, 0.17830727994441986, 0.0004059531493112445, 0.009212063625454903, 0.1036110669374466, 0.02556401677429676, 0.29988083243370056, 0.08752650767564774, 0.0008691890398040414, 0.019375979900360107, 0.19002597033977509]}
