{"reviews": ["\"This review has been a burden of monumental proproportions.I was contacted by a representative from Kiss Me Organics to test out their culinary grade matcha green tea.I didn't realize until I accepted her offer that  \"\"Matcha\"\" was a different--very different kind of green tea.  One, that I was to learn didn't taste remotely like traditional green tea.Then there was the issue of a review written by \"\"Don,\"\" claiming that Kiss Me Organics was offering something less than legitimate.Although, there's no way to know if Don actually tasted KMO's brand, his criticism cannot be dismissed as illogical.  So, I felt that I needed to educate myself on what a good or, at least, acceptable cup of matcha tastes like.***For almost two weeks, I went to every Japanese restaurant in South Miami attempting to interview a chef to ascertain from an experienced point of view the quality of the Kiss Me Organics tea.In those two weeks not one served matcha tea, most didn't even know about it.I did eventually find the one place that serves matcha: Teavana.  But, they only offer a \"\"ceremonial\"\" grade tea.  And, they wouldn't comment on Kiss Me Organics brand.This left me with preparing and tasting the tea with some guidelines for preparation that I found online.I took the tea pouch to work and made a carafe of it for me and my co-workers.  What I didn't anticipate is that not only would they grow throughout the day to love this drink which was, initially, okay but actually love it and thinking about different way that it could be used as a drink.My supervisor, Alcides, actually says that it's best cold and wonders what it would taste like with a bit of honey and on the rocks.***For the purpose of my first (and only) cup of the day, it was okay.  It tastes more like wheatgrass than green tea with the consistency of a green drink you'd buy in a Natural Whole Foods store.The froth which Don spoke about was there very lightly and only for a couple of minutes.  And, he was right about the color being a muddy green.  However, this is consistent with \"\"culinary\"\" grade matcha.I have to say that without any past experience with matcha to measure it against, I can't find any fault with it being what a professional says or doesn't say it should be.  Because, at the end of the day, I have to agree with my co-workers that if I'm not in the mood for a hot cup of matcha in the morning, it can be prepared as a different kind of beverage.And so, subjectively, matcha is an acquired taste and if given a chance (at least a second) cup, it would be something you'd return to over and over again.\"", "I was surprised when this product arrived.  I expected tea in individual bags.  I even had to look up the work Matcha as I was unfamiliar with its definition.  What I found was &#8220;Matcha is 100% natural, organic green tea leaves which have been carefully ground down to form a fine powder.&#8221;There were no instructions on the packaging other than saying it could be used to make lattes, smoothies or in baking.  I usually find packing to give a suggestion on the amount to use of a product for making a cup of tea for example.I also found the packaging to be a bit harder than other packages of similar type to open.  I had to use scissors and then pry it open with the point of a knife.  The web site stated that a free recipe guide eBook came with the purchase.  I never received this but since this was a product sent for review that may be why.I made several cups of tea and found the tea to have no flavor at all.  This would be great for baking as it wouldn&#8217;t mask the flavors in whatever you were making.  I tried it in several strengths and it still didn&#8217;t make any taste difference.If you like the idea of drinking green tea and don&#8217;t want a flavor, this is the product for you.", "Matcha is one of those products that you will either love or hate - the trick is finding the best blend in a recipe where the taste compliments the flavor since green tea doesn't mix with everything. I found that a quarter spoon mixes well with Vega protein shakes whereas a whole teaspoon will go into a fruit smoothie (any more and the color alone will put many people off). We've also had some success with baking it into products and it's barely noticeable. Personally, I like taking a teaspoon in hot water - it's like a strong green tea.I've tried several matcha products and like this one for a few reasons. The packaging is easy to open, use and reseal which is important when you're using such small quantities. This also doesn't contain any sugar and so many supposedly healthy matchas are absolutely full of sugar so although it has a bitter taste, this is the raw, real deal (you can always sweeten if it's not your style).Matcha is such an unbelievably good product that it's worth trying to make it part of your diet routine. I find it works extremely well as an appetite suppressant and does help with managing stress. Using 2 teaspoons a day, this pack will easily last over a month so is a good option if you want to add matcha to your diet.", "I regularly drink green tea and Matcha green tea powder.  On occasion, I've purchased blended Matcha beverage mixes and have always found them to be too sweet for my liking.  When offered the Kiss Me Organics Organic Matcha Green Tea (Culinary Grade), I was quite interested.  The Matcha I purchase for hot tea and the traditional Japanese tea ceremony or chado are from Japan and I get it in a little tin which costs about the same as this 4 ounce resealable bag of Matcha from China.  Those are referred to often as Royal or Imperial.  Basically, Matcha tea is totally unfermented and all of the tea leaves are consumed as the powder is not strained.With this culinary grade tea, I also received a link to a PDF file of recipes and found them to be interesting and well assembled.  This powder is protected in its package and because it's not a huge bag, the spoon slips easily in and out, reducing any powder loss.  Although I don't use my Japanese Matcha powder for cooking or even making green tea fraps, this culinary grade is ideal.  Using the recipes provided, smoothies are just the beginning!  I often use brewed tea in cooking in place of stocks or water, and this product makes that even easier.  Think of powdered bouillon and you catch my drift.  Matcha powder has an herbaceous taste, so don't think of this as just any green tea because it is not.  It is filled with benefits which seem to change all the time.Sample provided for review.", "This is my first experience with Matcha, so I can't really compare this flavor to any others.  However, I will say that I have found it very palatable and that it does provide a very nice, easy sustained energy boost.  The taste was slightly like a green tea, and otherwise mostly quite earthy.  I didn't detect any noticeable aftertaste.  It's a taste I'd say isn't bad, but it isn't great- but the energy and focus it provides makes it very nice.The color is a vibrant green, and luckily for me it came with a recipe guide that was quite comprehensive.  I used mine in muffins, smoothies, and shakes.  I never tried just drinking it with water.I especially liked it in the Minty Matcha Mojito because I have fresh mint growing.  It made a nice bright green drink that was both relaxing and yet energizing too.The recipe book that was emailed to me was a pdf - Itwas very nice with recipes in several categories.  It made my introduction to matcha very pleasant.The energy I'd get when having a matcha drink would last for many hours- with no jitters or crash, just a nice clear focus.", "I have enjoyed green tea for many years and was eager to try this powder. Since I make smoothies every day it was easy to add some to my concoction.First, though, I had to open the package. Unfortunately, I found the package difficult to open. It had two notches that were supposed to easily tear so I could open it. Both notches failed, and I had to use scissors to get into the package. I do like that the package is resealable, but someone needs to work on the package design.You don't want to use too much of this stuff. It has a strong taste (not terrible but can be overpowering if you aren't careful). Still, I don't mind the taste, and I am convinced the supplement is a healthy addition to my diet. This was a great idea for a product, and I'm interested in what else KissMeOrganics comes out with.Note: I received a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "I make smoothies for our family almost every day, and I'm always looking for quality, tasty, healthy ingredients to add.  I was very pleased with this matcha powder, mainly because my kids thought it tasted great in their smoothie.  Getting them to eat and drink &#34;healthy&#34; concoctions is sometimes a struggle, but they loved this.In the bag, this matcha is a light greenish color and has a slight smell like grass or hay, which I find pleasant.  I added about one teaspoon of matcha powder for each serving (along with oatmeal, yogurt, banana and strawberry) in the blender, and mixed it all up.  It gave the smoothie a greener color, but wasn't overwhelming in color or flavor.Research shows that green tea/matcha boosts energy, revs up the metabolism, and is a powerful antioxidant.  This matcha is organic and certified free of chemicals and preservatives.I received a sample of KissMeOrganics Organic Matcha green tea powder for testing and review purposes.", "This culinary matcha lends a beautiful color and green tea flavor and aroma to anything it is added to, from baked goods to smoothies.  The herbaceous flavor is versatile and it is just as tasty stirred in a glass of milk with honey as it is paired with citrus, vegetables, or chocolate.  It can even be enjoyed by simply sprinkling it over a bowl of vanilla ice cream.Green tea is a rich source of xanthines for a helpful metabolic boost, as well as a good source of antioxidants and micronutrients.  The powder is much more concentrated than brewed green tea.This matcha dissolves well in liquids or melted fats or it can be sifted into dry ingredients for baking.It is produced in accordance with USDA organic standards and is packaged in a handy resealable pouch.Kiss me Organics provided a sample for evaluation and review.", "Since I started drinking this I have experienced great sustaining energy throughout my day. I add half a teaspoon to my smoothies and I feel energized the entire day. I am happier, more upbeat, literally dancing on my feet. I get a lot of work done and I don't crash. I cannot drink coffee because it makes me ill, literally, and caffeine has not effect on me (I've taken 6 shots of espresso and besides the uncomfortable belly ache, I went right to sleep). So, I am not sure exactly what it is about this Tea Powder but it DOES work to get you going and increase your energy.Today is the first work day I have not used this (don't use it on the weekends) and my day dragged and I was exhausted by 2 PM.I will keep updating this review as I try this powder for other uses. But, for smoothies, it is great. Highly recommend.* Sample provided for review.", "I am new to matcha, so I can't compare this with others.  However, I can say that I am now a matcha-holic!  This is a culinary grade, so more designed for baking and smoothies, but I decided to taste it with just hot water to understand the flavor.  The powder dissolved surprisingly quickly and without much effort.  The color is beautiful and is not clear like standard green tea.  The texture is more akin to coffee made in a coffee press - a bit turbid and creamy.  It is a completely different experience.As a culinary grade matcha, I expected some bitterness, and it is there.  However, some stevia helped counter it to create a balanced and delicious drink, even without milk.While I don't have enough experience to recommend this product over the competition, I have been very happy with it and will likely be ordering more when it runs out.Thank you to the company for a review sample.", "I'm an agnostic as regards the various health claims--especially regarding anti-oxidants--that are made for such items.  But there seems to be enough evidence that drinking gree tea is healthy.  So I do try to have a cup a few times a week.Meanwhile, I do drink a smoothie almost every day.  I have two I like and I use them to different ends.  For just a big dose of fruit, I blend orange juice, a frozen banana and some frozen fruit, usually blueberries or strawberries.  For a protein dose, often a substitute lunch, I blend almond milk, a frozen banana and peanut butter. But they both taste so good, and I'm puritanical enough, that I try to add some extra nutritional goodness : chia seeds or flax meal for the most part.When the vendor offered this matcha powder it seemed like a potential additive to soothe my conscience.  I was only worried about what it might do to the taste.Fear not.  I've tried it in both and while it does radically change the color it does no harm to the flavors.A big thumbs up.", "While health and wellness are pretty important to me, I am not a band-wagoner. But I've been wanting to try matcha for a long time so when a recent opportunity to receive a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review came up I did a lot of research into it. Its health benefits are awesome but if you're like me and tend to prefer tea and coffee over soda and juice you'll love it because matcha is delicious.But let me tell you specifically about my experience with Kiss Me Organics' organic matcha. I giggled when I opened up my package from Amazon because there was a note attached to the bag to warn about the strong aroma to expect when I opened the pouch. This is very fresh and therefore the smell is very rich and verdant as soon as you open it. I love the scent myself so I had to resist sniffing lest I get it all over!I've been experimenting with it since receiving my complimentary sample and I don't own a matcha whisk so my teas have been a little silty but I found a clever way to fix that by using my french press to prepare it. If you don't care for the taste of matcha it can be hidden in fruit smoothies or used in baking. Something to consider if you want to bake though is that high heat destroys many antioxidants so if you're focusing on matcha for its health benefits I'd recommend something delicious that doesn't involve boiling or baking like my Matcha Mint Magic drink or making popsicles if you're not into smoothies or teas.Don't worry if you're not a matcha maven yet, KMO has got ya covered. They will email you a really helpful recipe book when you purchase their organic matcha. I expected it to be kind of slapped together but it's very nice, with full color photos and realistic ingredients. Not just smoothies, lattes, and teas but ways to incorporate it into pizza, frosting, dips, curries, and meat dishes. I really want to try some matcha scones!What I've been really impressed with is the lack of an astringent aftertaste that I commonly find I have when drinking regular green tea. It's smooth and mildly sweet with a green flavor that's rich without being tart. I also have experienced a balanced and notable mental energy boost without the jitters and crashed-feeling coffee and black tea usually give me. I haven't noticed considerable differences in my skin or metabolism yet but it's still a new addition to my routine.All in all, if you're looking for a budget-friendly way to introduce matcha into your health and wellness routine I would definitely recommend it. The quality is good and the benefits are well worth finding ways to make it part of your every day diet in some way.", "I accepted this product for an honest review. I am not really a big tea drinker, however I know that Green Tea can be very beneficial for us all. I haven't had Green Tea in a while so I thought I would give it a go. The package it came in was secure. I had no problems with it, nor concerns.  My sister lives with me, and she asked if she could also try the tea. I brewed two cups. She loved hers  and said it tasted just as it should, but I did not like the taste of mine at first. She is however more use to Green Tea  flavor than I am.  She suggested that I try it in a Smoothie. Hum, okay I'll give it a shot.  How did that turn out. Well, I could tolerate it much better in a Smoothie, and after several sips I actually enjoyed it, somewhat. .  Perhaps my next use of it will be in a cupcake with lots of icing. Okay, maybe not too much icing.I do like all the benefits that consuming Green Tea does for your body in so many areas, and this product seems to be packed with them.  Actually I had forgotten how good it is for you, and when I finished my  Smoothie I was happy to have helped my body.  I just need to get use to the taste of it again. I have had some everyday and I actually believe my body is consuming its goodness. I do feel more alert and less tired.  I believe for  Green Tea users this product delivers what you are expecting. Enjoy!", "I received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review.I love green tea and drink it every day with my lunch. Much better and healthier than any diet drinks.This product is excellent. Contrary to a negative review complaining about its color and freshness, the package I received contained nice green matcha that was delicious (green tea is an acquired taste and is not for everyone).Initially I thought the current price of 25.00 was exorbitant. I was wrong. I based that initial opinion on the fact that I can buy Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea), 100% Japanese Green Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags at my local Costco for 14.69. However after I wrote that in my initial review, the seller contacted me and correctly pointed out that the Costco product is not organic, and also that I was getting tea bags rather than matcha (if you use the Costco product you know that the amount of matcha accompanying each tea bag is negligible).Anything organic always carries a more expensive price tag. Other sellers on the internet of organic matcha green tea powder that I saw charge at least as much and often more (sometimes double) than this seller. So this product is reasonably priced for what you get.I found that only a small amount was necessary to give me the same potency that I was getting from the Costco tea bags, so I can probably get at least 50 cups from this bag (I'm still experimenting how much to use, so that number may be higher).Bottom line: If you are willing to pay more money for organic green tea powder, this product is a good buy.", "Green tea,  is known to be incredibly healthy.  It boosts energy and metabolism.  It can increase your focus. It can improve over all skin health.  It's full of anti-oxidants.  It has been rumored to battle cancer successfully. There's even evidence that one of the antioxidants found in green tea can generate new brain cells. Matcha is finely ground, high quality green tea powder.  It has 137 times the antioxidants found in brewed green tea.  The higher quality the matcha, the more sweet and intense the flavor. It is popularly used in tea, noodles, as a dye, and in Japanese confections.I'll be honest.  I don't like green tea.  For years, I've had people trying to push it on me, stating how healthy it is.  If I can't stomach the taste, it doesn't matter how healthy it is.  Now, here's the problem. What I've tried in the past has been factory brewed and bottled green tea.  Or green tea bags.  I don't care for it at all.  I find it bitter with a chalky texture.Matcha is definitely different than green tea.  It doesn't have the chalky texture and it doesn't have the bitterness.  I still wouldn't call it sweet, but it's definitely more tolerable.  My discovery into Macha has been slow-moving.  I began by putting a teaspoon in with my coffee grounds when I made coffee.  As I became more bold and began to realize that I didn't hate green tea after all, we diversified into green tea milk shakes, green tea and cilantro bread, and every other idea we could come up with.  Eventually, we grew incredibly bold and made green tea cupcakes with green tea frosting. Delicious!  Honestly, my favorite way to consume green tea!  It was sweet, but still had a slight tea-ish flavor to it.Kiss Me Organics offers high quality Matcha that is available only through Amazon.  It's finely ground and organic and can be put into most anything in order to get your daily dose, which is about 1/2 teaspoon to a teaspoon.  I found it incredibly versatile and a great way to change my mind about green tea.
