{"reviews": ["I must disagree with the other reviewers who said this tea is not great but not bad. It is bad. I've had quite a few brands of Earl Grey tea, and this is absolutely the worst. The tea has very little tea taste, and the oil of bergamot (the Earl Grey flavor) tastes artificial and smells like cheap perfume.Every other brand is better than this one. Avoid.", "Lipton is trying to get into more &#34;gourmet&#34; teas by improving their packaging and charging more for the tea. Sadly, a silken bag does not better flavor make. Although these pyramid tea bags are better than the paper bags Lipton typically packages their tea in, the flavor is still mediocre at best.There are a lot of better tasting teas on the market for the same price, Tazo (Starbucks's brand) being one of them, for example.If you have allergies to corn, beware that this tea contains non-descriptive natural flavors. One article I read claimed that natural flavors can also mean formaldehyde and other awful components. Do your research.I would not describe this tea as a good value for its mediocre flavor.", "Are you an Earl Grey fan? I am, and while I appreciate the convenience of bags, I really can taste the paper when I brew it that way. So I was especially pleased when Lipton came out with the pyramid nylon bags. It allows all of the convenience without the paper. I'm not sure if it is designed that way, but I actually find it faster to brew my tea in these bags.It will never replace a nice &#34;cuppa&#34; with a proper teapot and friends to share it, but it sure if super for grabbing at work or for a quick cup at home.", "When I have Earl Grey it is usually Twinings brand.  However it is somewhat expensive.  Last night I tried Lipton Pyramid Earl Grey tea.  It was very good and flavorful.  No off tones or artificial flavors.  I like the pyramid bag as I think it allows the hot water to completely surround the cut tea inside.  I will definitely get this product again.  Earl Grey - for me - is a nice finish to a hard worked day!", "Lipton Black Tea, Earl Grey, Pyramid Tea Bags, 18 Count.  This tea has a weird kick to it.  It tastes perfumy, way-too-strong citrusy (it tastes more like a perfume citrusy than a food citrusy).  I tried this product again and again to give it a fair review.  Finally, I said that's enough, and will have to throw out the rest of the box.  I simply cannot drink it.I've never drank any tea that tastes like this.  I usually drink regular black tea.  And I drink it a lot.  And I love it.  And sometimes I drink those herbal teas.  Especially the fruity ones; peach is my favorite.  So even though I am not an expert on tea, I do have teas that I love and enjoy.But this tea tastes weird.", "I enjoy most of Lipton's tea blends. However I find I prefer the traditional flavor of Earl Grey when it's made with bergamot. Lipton's Earl Grey is made with marigold flowers, which makes for a milder and less bold cup of tea. It's okay, but not my first choice for a cup of tea. This tea would most likely be enjoyed by those who find some of the Earl Grey blends from other companies a bit too strong, and would like a milder and less aromatic version.", "I'm not much for bergamot flavor, but this tea bag has the perfect light balance of black tea with just the right touch of bergamot. I did not expect to like it at all, but it's one of my favorite iced teas now. I do drink it hot, but mostly cold.", "Let me begin by saying we don't usually drink teas by Lipton, preferring instead an unnamed competitor who is known for producing Earl Grey. My son and I are also both big fans and regular drinkers of Earl Grey. All that being noted, these are great tea bags! The pyramid-shaped mesh bag and the particular combination of tea and spices works together to produce a flavorful and natural tasting tea that was delightful. I remain concerned about the environmental impact of these bags, but that aside, I like the tea made from these bags a little better than that from our regular Earl Grey bags. If you like Earl Grey, or tried it in the past but thought it too bland, I recommend that you give these bags a try. You will be pleased you did!", "Yes, I do like a strong tea.When I drink black tea I use either a loose leaf..I like Adiago...or for the convenience of bagged tea, I buy Irish tea bags.The Irish love their tea and they know how to make a tea bag.Other than plain black, the only flavored tea I love is Earl Gray.And this is not the best..or even very good.I do like the 'bags' and perhaps they help with the brewing process.But you can only brew what ya got. And this ain't got much flavor.The bergamont flavor is subtle to say the least, too, too subtle for me.And I must say the amount of tea in the bag seems very small.They say it will make a 8 oz. cup so for my mug I needed two bags. Even then, not much flavor.Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about.For my Earl Gary fix, I will be going elsewhere.", "\"The \"\"tea bags\"\" are quite unique and attractive - they are pyramid shaped and the material seems to be fine netting. The tea was good but I did wish it was stronger. I am going to brew a second cup and use two teabags - hoping that helps. The tea flavor was pleasant but I felt it lacked a distinctive 'earl grey\"\" flavor.\"", "I like this black tea that has the highest grading of black tea, known as &#34;orange pekoe,&#34; and &#34;pekoe cut black tea.&#34;  These are high grades of tea leaves with orange pekoe being the highest grade and needing to be picked carefully with one's fingertips.This is not the traditional Earl Grey tea that has some oil extracted from rinds of the bergamot orange.  Bergamot oil makes for a bold, citrus-like fragrance.This is one of the many other types of Earl Grey tea, although not well appreciated.  This Lipton Earl Grey has marigold flowers in it.  The marigold flower is a cleansing and detoxifying herb with anti-fungal, anti-viral, and antibiotic activity.  This makes it an extremely healthy black tea.Other more popular Earl Grey teas place with black tea with lavender and Seville oranges and is often called, Lady Grey.  French Earl Grey Tea uses jasmines.I like that the Earl Grey with marigold flowers is so healthy and subtle in taste.  Also, I think the shape of the tea bags and it helps to get all the flavor and benefit out of the bag very quickly.", "I agree with another reviewer's comment that it doesn't quite taste like your average Earl Grey tea, but I really like this flavor. I'm a huge fan of the Lipton Pyramid tea bags, having been a regular user of their standard black tea pyramid bags for a couple years now. I'm not entirely sure if the tea inside the bag is any different, but I really like that you can see the loose-leaf tea inside the bag before and during the brew. It also seems like you get a cleaner tasting tea. I have not traditionally been much of an Earl Grey drinker, but I really think I will go get some more of these to add to my rotation. I'd definitely recommend giving these a try!", "Lipton features &#34;black tea&#34; on it's packaging with Earl Grey in smaller lettering. I'm not sure what the think they are selling. This Earl Grey is not as flavorful or aromatic as either Bigelow or Twinings tea.  It tastes slightly sweeter than the other two brand.I don't know what problem the pyramid shape tea bag addresses. About the only thing I can figure is that it makes the tea bag sink to the bottom of a cup more easily.  I don't think a tea will brew better at the bottom of the cup or floating on the top.Other tea bags are always wrapped in foil or plastic packaging. These triangles are just packaged in a cardboard box. Maybe that is why they have less aroma and flavor than other brands.", "Earl Grey is not a tea that is always the same flavor, but rather one made with different ingredients.  For example, the most commonly added ingredient is the bergamot orange.  This one lists the first ingredient as &#8220;orange pekoe,&#8221; which is not derived from an orange, but is a grade of tea.  It&#8217;s a bold tea, but if you are looking for that citrus flavor you might be disappointed as the bergamot is only listed as a &#8220;flavor&#8221; on the front.For a sweetener I added a small dollop ofOrganic Blue Agave, another natural product that enhanced the flavor of this tea. The little pyramid bags act similar to a tea ball infuser, allowing the tea leaves and other ingredients to float free in the water.  Undoubtedly, this only enhances the flavor.  This is a good, full-flavored, bold tea, but if you are expecting a Twinings you won&#8217;t get it.  This is a unique tea blend that will be easy to get used to.INGREDIENTS:  Orange pekoe and pekoe cut black tea, marigold flowers, natural flavor.CAFFEINE LEVEL:  25 mg. per serving.FULL LINE OF LIPTON PYRAMID TEAS:Lipton Pyramid Tea Bags, White Tea With Island Mango & Peach FlavorLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, White With Blueberry PomegranateLipton Red Tea, Harvest Strawberry & Passion FruitLipton Black Tea, Bavarian Wild Berry, Premium Pyramid Tea BagsLipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea BagsLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, Tuscan LemonLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, Bedtime StoryLipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea BagsLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, Black Tea, Earl Grey", "I am no tea connoisseur, however I know what I like. I generally love Earl Grey and Lady Grey tea and tend to stay away from bagged teas - I don't really trust them anymore since I've switched to loose tea. But I thought I would take the chance on this one, simply because I've heard so much about the new style packaging.It is a pyramid shape and it (the bag it self) is no longer made from 'tissue paper' or whatever they used to use. Now it feels like some sort of nylon mesh. If that helps to brew a better cup of tea then sobeit. If the tea is supposed to expand to fill the material -well, it doesn't. That does NOT make this tea any less delicious.This is really not the way Earl Grey tastes, but it does have a very unique aroma and flavor that I found most enjoyable. It was a peppery scent which carries over to the flavor of the tea. It is not as rich or strong as I would usually like, but I found this to be a very pleasant drink for the late afternoon or early evening.It has a lovely aroma while steeping, and an almost delicate flavor.What made me drop this a star is that while it is flavored with Italian Bergamot orange oil, it also is made with several other ingredients and tea types that a traditional Earl Grey does not include.", "Lipton's long leaf tea in a new shaped (at least to me) tea bag makes a rich bodied delicious Earl Grey black tea. The pyramid shaped tea bag allows the long-leaf tea to maximally mix with the boiling water thus bringing out the most flavor. Delicious.", "Lipton's series of triagular teas is solid and dependable without quite hitting the 'perfect' mark. While the Earl Grey flavor comes through here, you have to steep it a bit to get the full monty; on the other hand, it has good aroma and if you do steep it, the reward is a good-flavored version that satisfies. For excellence in this variety, I would probably go with a more venerated brand, but this was my tea of choice for breakfast as long as the box lasted - nothing like the smell of Earl Grey tea. It manages quite well for a mass-produced and easily-acquired brand.", "I grew up on Lipton tea and haven't stopped drinking it since. I like the design of the tea bag; though I'm not sure how much more functional they are than the regular flat tea bags, it's fun to look at the pyramid shape. I don't think that the earl grey flavor is particularly strong, which is a shame as earl grey is such a pleasant flavor for me. I could easily use two bags per cup of tea. I also opened a few of them up to make earl grey shortbread and the tea flavor just wasn't where I would have liked it.", "Earl Grey tea is one of my favorite teas. A black tea with a faint lemon flavor from the addition of bergamot, it goes very well with Tea Buns and assorted quickbreads.  Each box ofLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, Earl Greycontains 18 of their pyramid-shaped tea bags, which allow the tea a bit more brewing space for a cup closer in taste to that brewed from loose tea.The tea bags themselves are recyclable (#1) and made from the same food grade plastic that water & juice comes in.  They are microwave safe.  (I recently looked this information up for another review of pyramid tea bags.)One teeny-tiny issue - Like nearly all tea bags, fine tea dust can work its way out of the bags during shipping.  As these tea bags do not have a paper over-wrap, some of that works its way out of the box where you will notice it inside the cellophane wrapper. It is nothing whatever to worry about.I find it handy to store open boxes of tea in zipper plastic storage bags to keep things fresh and avoid mess.  These Lipton boxes fit perfectly in a quart freezer bag.Grandma's $0.02 - Nice for an afternoon cuppa.  Recommended", "I find that most teas lack flavor, and the taste resembles warm water regardless of the amount of water or time the tea bag seeps.  However, this black tea has a great, smooth flavor!  I usually have to add lemon and/or honey to hot teas to taste anything, but not in this case.  This tea has citrus and herb undertones that do not leave an unpleasant after taste.  I have only tried this tea with hot water and not over ice.", "For decades, I believed that the gold standard for Earl Grey tea in America has been Twining's.  According to recent reviews at Amazon, Twining's may have reduced the strength of its brew -- some claim to save money.So I was curious to try what I believe is this new entry into the Earl Grey segment from Lipton.It's tasty but also a bit bland and I think not as rich in subtle flavors as the Twining's I remember.  Twining's had notes of citrus and oil of Bergamot, and I don't detect them as readily here.I have deducted two stars from this product because first, the pyramid-shaped teabags are almost impossible to wring dry.  Lipton's classic flow-through tea bag would lie down in your spoon and allow easy wringing with the tea bag string.  This pyramid refuses to lie flat, and I wound up having to hold it down with my other hand so I could wring it dry.  Not easy or elegant in the least.  I also note that these tea bags, unlike the flow-throughs, have no individual packaging to keep them fresh.  They sit loose in the box.I deducted another star because these Lipton Earl Grey bags seem to be priced rather higher than the contemporary Twining's.  Wassup wit dat?This tea does pack a dose of caffeine, and I will be interested to see if it gives me the pickup of my usual mug of coffee.  Even though I switched to a medium coffee blend recently, the coffee seems to give me heartburn, and if the tea doesn't, I may switch back -- but likely to Twining's (or Bigelow's), not Lipton.", "I am a bit generous giving this four stars, but it is from a reliable maker. My first impression was that the flavor was bitter and a bit flat, without the usual bouquet of good black tea and bergamot. The best Earl Grey tea uses premium black tea with natural bergamot(a type of citrus fruit). In this product, the ingredients list is as follows: Orange pekoe and pekoe black tea, marigold flowers, and natural flavor. Let's go through these. For years, Lipton has been telling us about orange pekoe and pekoe teas. Has a nice sound to it, doesn't it? What does it mean? Actually, the meaning varies, but basically all it means is a medium grade black tea. It is NOT a type of tea, which Lipton probably would like us to believe and it is NOT even the highest, premium grade, just a medium grade. Lipton has been using this term for so long, they really have created a new definition for it, so maybe in their minds, it is something better than the usual definition. They also tell us it is a long-leaf tea. Maybe that is why it is flat and bitter. Usually, the small leaves are considered the best. Why do they tell us the leaves are long and the grade is only medium? They would be better off keeping quiet!I hear that Perdue Chicken feeds their chickens marigold flowers. Why do we need it in Earl Grey tea? Does it lower the cost?Finally, why is it so hard to have real bergamot in bergamot tea? Is it asking too much? Natural flavor could mean anything. If you look at the tea, you will see little bright white tubules. Are these crystalized natural flavor pieces? Certainly doesn't look very citrusy.There is nothing particularly wrong with this tea, and I enjoy drinking it, but I am easy to please. I have had much better Earl Grey tea.Two quick notes. The teabags are quite nice, little triangular pyramids made out of a synthetic plastic material.Star Trek fans may recall that Captain Jean-Luc Picard's favorite tea was Earl Grey, the best advertising Earl Grey tea ever got!", "I've been a tea fanatic since 1972, my last semester at Colgate University when I went over to New Delhi, India on an independent study program. I love almost all kinds of teas and in my condo in San Diego I have two shelves filled with different flavors. NONE has been Earl Grey and the reason is that over the years I tried Earl Grey and there was eiither a slight sharpness to the flavor, or else they were in tea bags and no matter how prestigious the name the tea tasted cheap, almost sprayed with flavor rather than blended. So NO JOKE I never had a full box of Earl Grey. Until NOW and I tried Lipton's black tea Earl Grey. This is the best Earl Grey I've had and it will be in on my tea shelf forever. They have smoothed the flavor of Earl Grey, and also enhanced it so it's the best, most delicious and satisfying cup of Earl Grey ever -- and I would say one of the best teas I've had. The front of the box says it's &#34;Earl Grey with Bergamont flavor and other natural flavor.&#34; The back of the box says it has Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea, Marigold Flowers, and natural flavors. Plus, it uses a pyramid teabag. There is a school of thought that a pyramid tea bag gives a fuller, more flavorful tea, since it's closer to loose tea. I will say: WHATEVER. The bottom line is that I have never wanted to have a box of Earl Grey on my shelf until now. The taste is smoother, fuller -- and my 18 tea bags are almost gone after a week. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!", "\"For ease of use and flavor these score a \"\"five\"\".  The flavor is excellent and the interesting plastic pyramid \"\"bags\"\" are easy to use and work well.The box gets dusty with tea dust (not a problem).I question how healthy it is to use plastic in boiling hot water.  BPA???I also question how long these will remain fresh since there is no individual packaging, once you break the plastic on the box *all* of the tea bags are exposed to air.The flavor is great, the ease of use is great.\"", "\"My baseline evaluation of any tea is, first, Is it drinkable without anything added?This tea passes that test wonderfully.  The aroma is just fantastic and enticing.  It draws you in.  Then, like a fine wine (?), some of the \"\"notes\"\" of the flower start coming in, too.  It is delicious and satisfying and calming all at once.  You can definitely tell that quality tea leaves went into this.  I give it an A-plus, but just wish, in the interest of full and honest disclosure in labeling, that we'd all be told what the \"\"natural flavors\"\" are at the end of the ingredient list.  There's no good reason NOT to label fully, in today's marketplace.Highly recommended.If it turns out that the little triangle \"\"bags\"\" are plastic, then everything I've said would be negated.  Just in case, I've started cutting them open and putting the actual tea leaf mix into my own glass and metal containers (one of those steel mesh brewing balls).\"", "I enjoy Lipton brands a lot and my only other preferred tea is Luzianne.  Lipton'sEarl Grey Pyramid Tea Bagsare pretty bad.  Though I really like the design of their pyramid bags, and really like the Earl Gray flavor; there is something very off with the flavor from this tea.  It's like a very strange combination.  The Bergamot flavor is missing from this, no question.  You can't even smell it when you open the package.  The ingredients mention some type of marigold flowers which do not mix well with the Earl Gray.  I would skip this particular product; it just doesn't taste at all like true Earl Gray Tea.", "Lipton Pyramid Tea Bags, Earl GreyCategory: Beverages&#34;Lipton earl grey tea is made with long leaf black tea leaves and bergamot flavors. The unique pyramid shape of our tea bags creates a truly exceptional tea experience.&#34;Okay, I'll try it! :)  *reaches for a favorite clear cup*After steeping a single Lipton Pyramid, Earl Grey, tea bag for about 7 minutes ( I like tea a bit on the strong side ) in 8 oz of boiling water -- and sweetened to taste ( cuz that's the way I roll with My tea ) -- one ends up with a clear golden brown-colored (like a smoky topaz gem stone), extremely aromatic, full-bodied Earl Grey tea.

Admittedly, I've never been a huge fan of Earl Grey with its very pronounced flavor profile and distinctive taste.  A tea snob would probably put me in my place for the suggestion (and I worked in association with a premium coffee/tea establishment for over four years), but everyone has a different taste profile.  Let's just say that Lipton Earl Grey did not particularly revise my feelings.If you don't love Earl Grey, this still has that strong earthiness and familiar bite.If you do love Earl Grey, this has a slightly sweeter flavor than traditional blends (probably marigold flowers) that might throw you off.My recommendation for any tea product is to sample one bag before committing to a huge purchase.  While I wouldn't buy this tea again, you might love it.  And a shout out to Lipton's pyramid tea bags and commitment to long leaf tea.  KGHarris, 1/14.", "This tea is pretty good.  Standard Lipton quality and I like Earl Grey as is.  These brewed just like tea bags. I'm not sure what the benefit is supposed to be to the pyramid shape but the tea was still good.The box packaging had me worried when I first got it as there was loose black tea under the plastic packaging which made me think that the tea bags weren't holding the loose tea very well. However once I opened the box there wasn't any loose tea and there wasn't loose tea in my cup either so I don't know why the box itself was so messy.", "I've tried a variety of tea brands and Lipton is one of the better ones. And this flavor in particular is quite good. I recommend you give it a shot.", "I definitely have loved the way Lipton has made innovative ways of making tea with any tea drinker, from their new K-Cup teas, to their half tea and half lemonade drink mixes. But hearing the news of them changing the way we drink teas and trying it with a pyramid tea bag, I was definitely surprised about this one. Lipton's new Pyramid Tea Bags with a Earl Grey taste is alright, yet it doesn't change the taste or provide a better taste to how your drink your teas. It isn't a bad idea, but could have had a bit more of the taste than feeling a bit bland, or just tasting the same as you get from any normal tea bag. Still, it isn't bad from any angle. But more could've been more from each sip of Earl Grey.Price: B-Taste: C 1/2+Overall: C+", "Lipton pyramid style tea bags in &#34;Earl Grey&#34; black tea flavor I give 4 out of 5 stars.
