I was introduced to it when I went to visit my sister - and was surprised at how good adding milk and sugar to this particular tea worked! This blend is just made for it.The pyramid bags are a nice improvement on the paper and don't add a taste that I often found when I was using the paper bags instead of brewing it in a proper pot.A very nice addition to the Lipton line of tea.", "Lipton Pyramid Tea Bag is a rich, full flavored tea.  They almost replace my coffee fix.  I intend to keep a box on hand.", "Lipton Black Tea, English Breakfast, in pyramid-shaped bags.  Not exactly the flavor that is in regular black tea.  I do drink regular black tea all the time, and the flavor in it is perfect.  This flavor, however, is a little off.  I will not buy this tea.  I will continue buying the regular black tea.This flavor is not my favorite, but it is drinkable; that is why I gave it 4 stars.  I wouldn't buy it, but I can drink it.I am not an expert on tea.  I need to read those cozy mysteries that feature tea, then maybe I would learn about tea.  I know there is at least one tea cozy mystery series, and probably more.  I haven't read any of them yet, but they are near the top of my list.I only drink cold tea; I do not like hot tea.  I drink my tea either totally unsweetened or with only a small amount of sugar.  I do not like a lot of sugar in my tea.", "I drink a lot of black tea. It's pretty much all I drink. I rarely drink soda, never drink milk or coffee and only occasional have juice. So my beverage of choice is a hot cup of tea, and almost always black (not really into herbal or green teas). I drink everything from Irish Breakfast to Earl Grey. English Breakfast is actually pretty different in flavor than most other black teas. It has a simpler flavor that works well for building on. For those that enjoy adding milk, honey or sugar to their teas, this is a nice blend. I enjoy it plain myself, since I don't particularly enjoy any milk or sugar added to my teas.Lipton has impressed me with some of their most recent black tea blends. My favorite teas come from the Harney and Son Teas, so I'm use to drinking their VERY bold tea black blends. When I use to think of drinking anything from Lipton, it was the pitchers of brown iced tea my mother use to make on hot days in the summer time. I never thought of Lipton as a brand that would make hot tea blends I would enjoy. However even with the milder blends Lipton makes, they are still quite good. They make a cup of tea that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people. Strong enough that those who like a bold cup will still like it, but no so strong that it puts off the casual tea drinker.This tea snob says Lipton makes great tea blends!", "\"LIPTON English Breakfast tea tastes like a milder version of Earl Grey.As an habitual orange pekoe drinker, this tea took some getting used to but it was worth the effort. A rich, smooth flavor, and clearly more \"\"kick\"\" than the generic teas I use at work. I've gotta admit this is quality stuff.The teabag is quite remarkable too, not just for its unique trianagular shape, but because unlike paper bags, this thin mesh material (whatever it is!) doesn't weaken or tear after soaking in hot water, and its microscopic screen allows flavor out while keeping the smallest leaf particles trapped inside the bag.If there's such a thing as a state-of-the-art teabag, this is it.Altogether, a definite winner!\"", "While it's definitely not what I would call &#34;premium&#34; tea (along the lines of Harney & Sons, Smith Tea, etc.), this tea does serve a useful place. For me, the first cup of tea of the day is not one that needs to be premium. It needs to be hot, taste reasonable, and be drinkable. My goal is wake up and help get the kids ready for school, not necessarily relax and enjoy. For this purpose, the English Breakfast by Lipton serves well. There is a bit too much dust for my liking to be considered premium, but overall, it works fine.", "I've been an avid tea drinker for many years -- black, green, white, herbal, in whatever flavor you put in front of me. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for a good, simple black tea. This one is pretty good, with a fairly rich flavor (I leave the tea bag in, by the way). I like the pyramid bags -- neater and cleaner than the typical tea bags. The flip-top box is user-friendly. And I appreciate that the packaging includes the caffeine content, as well as the flavonoids.", "I drink a lot of tea and &#8220;English Breakfast &#8220; is a flavor of tea that I generally like. I have been drinking it for years. This Lipton brand is not one of my favorites. It is okay tasting but the flavor is a bit weak and bland. I prefer the English Breakfast flavor made by Bigelow.  I do like the pyramid shaped bags though.", "I drink various brands and types of black loose leaf tea, about 2-4 cups a day. As far as teabags go, I have had similar teas like Mighty Leaf Teas and PG Tips (that's one of my favorite loose leaf teas) as well as many others, so I decided to give Lipton a chance at their Pyramid tea bags. Upon looking at the tea, it seemed similar to the size of tea in a PG Tips pyramid bag, but smaller than Mighty Leaf's tea. The bag has a silky feel to it similar to Mighty Leaf. After boiling the water and letting the bag steep for over five minutes I was hoping that Lipton put out a tea that was better than their standard bag, but that did not turn out to be the case. I enjoy milk and sugar in my tea in the English tradition, Unfortunately, when I poured in my usual amount of milk, I noticed that the tea was lighter than I like having it. That was not a good sign, even regular Lipton bags can hold up to milk and sugar - the English Breakfast cannot. I found the tea to be weak, very nondescript, with very familiar Lipton undertones. Very disappointing. I don't mind having a standard Lipton teabag while out at a restaurant, in fact it is a refreshing change from the tea I usually have at home, but this English Breakfast Black Tea should be stronger with a different blend of teas - it is too similar to their standard tea, and weaker. Those tea lovers who are into Black Tea should probably stay away from this bland tea and pick up a box of PG Tips.", "This is a good tea. Tastes just like English breakfast/black tea is supposed to taste. Plain and simple. Nothing complicated.The pyramid bags are kind of cool in themselves. I hear that they work better than the old style too. The only down side is that a little of the tea gets through the bag and into the box which I have not seen with old style tea bags.The price seems steep compared to similar teas I've tried in the past. Admittedly, the others were made using old style bags, but I'm not sure if I'd say that difference is worth the higher price.", "Although I do think Lipton is trying to get their popularity back, they didn't quite make it with this version.  I let this teabag steep for 15 minutes, really, and still, no flavor.  Then, I even put it into the microwave to help it - nothing.  That was for a 12 ounce cup.  Even the 10 ounce still was without flavor.  Now, if you're looking to maybe using an 8 ounce or smaller English teacup, then you have a chance. But, drink it black.  It just won't hold up to milk.  Tetley's British blend is quite good and does hold up to milk but if you're partial to Lipton, then be prepared to use 2 teabags for this variety.", "These tea bags come in a box of 18 pyramid style tea bags. These tea bags seem to be stronger so they have less chance of breaking and the super fine mesh material doesn&#8217;t let any tiny pieces of tea leaves out of the bag. With regular tea bags the little piece of paper always seems to rip off the string but I haven&#8217;t had that problem with these.These contain premium long leaf black tea. If you open the box and smell the tea it really doesn&#8217;t have much of a scent at all. That made me think that I probably wasn&#8217;t going to like it at first but you can&#8217;t judge a book by its cover because it was really good. The instructions say to brew it for 3 &#8211; 5 minutes and I like my tea strong so I brewed it for 5 minutes. It&#8217;s a very dark and full flavored tea that I like with a little sweetener. This may be one of my favorite teas that I have tried so far.", "Lipton claims that &#8220;The unique shape of our tea bags, combined with long Ceylon and Kenya tea leaves allows for a truly exceptional tea experience.&#8221;  Well, I wouldn&#8217;t go that far, but this English Breakfast black tea is very good and perfect with a couple of cookies in the evening.  My husband really enjoys black tea and prefers it over the green.  The flavor, however is not quite as strong as some of the more expensive black teas such as Davidson&#8217;s.  It&#8217;s a nice everyday tea to have on hand.For a sweetener I added a small dollop ofOrganic Blue Agave, another natural product that enhanced the flavor of this tea. The little pyramid bags act similar to a tea ball infuser, allowing the tea leaves and other ingredients to float free in the water.  Undoubtedly, this only enhances the flavor.

But it is nice to have some tea bags around for when I'm in a hurry :-)  So, I was willing to give these a try.The pyramid design is great!  It gives the tea plenty of room to expand.

So here goesI drank Earl Grey last night and on the first taste realized it was a distinctive taste, that I'd experienced before by another company, but was not...quite...right...On the other hand, I'm drinking English Breakfast right now...again, having tasted and enjoyed it by another company, and am sitting drinking it with a quite satisfied smile.English Breakfast is a bit milder while the Earl Grey, I thought, was too overpowering, at least for me... It's nice for a change once in awhile but not one I would routinely choose...My normal tea consumption is 2-3 large mugs a day and have even experimented with regular teas from different brands...Lipton I would also choose on a regular basis...I found no great significance with the different tea bags, or frankly the higher quality tea as stated, of either of these compared to Lipton's normal brand... so if you are using that, try these two and do the taste test too!One thing I've found is that changing sweetners also affects the tea... I also use boiling water and in a microwave only in desperation! Microwaves makes sweetners foamy!I would recommend either of these to you, but, frankly, if these two types cost more, than better check them for yourself than take my or anybody's opinion.  Right? Tea lovers must be happy!GABixlerReviews", "\"I drink a lot of tea.  English Breakfast is a staple in my house, a good basic black tea that most everyone enjoys.  While I do often prefer loose tea made in a real teapot, tea bags certainly have their place, not least of which is in my Mama's recipe for Iced Tea.  (Mama was a Southern Girl.  I grew up on Iced Tea.)I really quite like theseLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, English Breakfast.  The extra space in the pyramid-shaped bags makes for a well-balanced brew that doesn't go bitter if you allow the bag to sit in the mug and I appreciate the lack of extra paper waste.  I did notice that another reviewer raised the issue of just what these bags are made of, so I went and looked that up.  Lipton says -\"\"PYRAMID TEA BAGS: The translucent Pyramid tea bag is made of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalatethe) the same food grade material clear water and juice bottles are made of. As with any plastic, it would not be considered biodegradable. PET is completely safe and is 100% recyclable within the plastics waste stream. The recycle symbol is #1.\"\"I see nothing there to worry about.  That same reviewer also brought up the issue of whether these pyramid tea bags can be used in the microwave.  I don't generally microwave tea (it takes longer to heat water in the microwave than it does on the stove) but the answer to that question happened to be directly below the information about the composition of the pyramid tea bags.  The answer was easy enough -\"\"MICROWAVING:  All Lipton tea bags are safe for use in the microwave\"\"I do have one relatively minor issue.  Tea keeps best if it is stored airtight.  These pyramid tea bags do not come in an outer wrapper and the box that contains them is just a lightweight cardboard box.  As a result, some tea dust does shake out of the box into the cellophane wrapper and you must either drink the tea fairly quickly once you've opened the box or do something else about storage. (There is a reason that loose tea often comes in a metal can.)  Luckily, a box ofLipton Pyramid Tea Bags, English Breakfastfits nicely into a 1-quart plastic zipper storage bag.Grandmas $0.02 - Not English Breakfast from a fine British Tea House, but acceptable flavor in a convenient package.Recommended\"", "I love the design of these teabags, they are a good shape for brewing and the material of the bag means that there is no tea residue left at the bottom of the mug. The tea itself is very good, although I had to brew it for rather a long time before it was a good strength for me to drink. Even then it was not the strongest English Breakfast tea I've ever had (and I'm English, so I've tried a few!)Overall though I was pleased with this tea and would get it again.", "I consider myself a cultured tea drinker - of the British variety. I am always willing to try anything that passes for a good cup of tea. There are many versions of what they call English Breakfast tea - unfortunately this one lacks the distinct flavor of &#34;Barry's&#34;  or even the robust &#34;PG tips&#34;. to my mind this tea is better suited to an evening cuppa - when one is not looking for a pick-me-up taste but are content with a mellower, smoother experience. On the plus side, I much prefer the pyramid design and I think it helps to maximize the flavor. I just wish there was a tad more of it with this particular product.", "\"I wanted to give this tea two stars,and I'll get to why shortly, but let me state up front that it's not a bad cup of tea. It's not a good cup of tea, either, but with a splash of half and half, it has a full bodied \"\"generic black tea\"\" taste, exactly like a cup of regular Lipton tea but stronger.That's the good part. The bad part? Lipton is hyping the pyramidal teabag for a tea that doesn't match their description on the back of the box. They write that English Breakfast tea is a mix of \"\"long Ceylon and Kenya tea leaves.\"\" English Breakfast tea is generally considered to be that, and the name is thought to originate from Colonial American times, when tea drinkers who put a splash of milk or cream in their morning tea called it by that name.So, Lipton doesn't mention that, nor the fact that it's traditional to add cream. I did, and I doubt I would have enjoyed this tea otherwise.But, that's not what bothers me. The pyramidal tea bag was invented for the reason that Lipton states. There are many tea companies that use it so the long leaves of tea are not crushed in packaging and to let the leaves steep better. Whether the latter \"\"works\"\" I can not say, but the former is certainly true. However, there is not a single long leaf of tea in these bags. Even though I suspected as much from looking at a closed bag, I opened one up and spilled out the contents. It looked like your average cheap crushed black tea leaves. I took a store-brand tea bag out of my cupboard, cut that open, and compared them. Exactly the same, including the absolute lack of aroma when dry. A good tea should smell good even when dry.If you want a cup of robust and tasty English Breakfast tea, I suggest you spend your money elsewhere, and if you want a cup of robust Lipton tea, leave your regular tea bag in for one or two minutes more. You'll save some money.Still, I give this product three stars, because I surprised how tasty it was. Nothing to write this much about (though I did!)  but there it is.\"", "It's been a while since I drank anything Lipton, and now I know why.  These 'English Breakfast' teabags are extremely weak.  I brew them the same as my other tea and all I end up with is a cup of hot watery milk.  Yuck.  I tried using two teabags to increase the flavor, but then it just tastes bitter and nasty.  Not to my tastes at all.  I'm going back toPG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240Count Boxes (Pack of 2).", "I drink tea almost every day, and I'm a fan of the netting in these pyramid bags.  It allows the water to pass through freely during steeping and allows the leaves to expand and release more flavor.However, I didn't think this tea was any different than regular Lipton black tea in the traditional paper teabags.  Perhaps the cut of the leaves was a little longer, but the flavor was somewhat weak even after steeping for 5 minutes.  English Breakfast Tea is usually strong, robust, and rich - just what you need to get going in the morning.  The second time, I added two bags to the water, and that was just about right as far as strength and flavor goes.  But that makes each cup of tea too expensive to enjoy.I prefer Twinings, Bigelow or Stash in their English Breakfast Tea varieties.  I give this Lipton brand 3.5 stars.", "\"Lipton is my favorite brand of tea. This \"\"English breakfast\"\" flavor black tea comes in pyramid shaped bags which helps them to brew faster.

I will buy this tea again along with several other of Lipton's delicious flavors! 4/5 stars!\"", "I'm not too familiar with English Breakfast tea, but this was a mild black tea that needed no extras like sugar.  There's no lingering after taste either.  And of course, I like the pyramid bag that Lipton has started using; it makes the tea more like loose leaf while keeping the convenience of the bag.", "This is the real deal. If you are into tea, this product is bulging with real tea flavor. There's nothing fancy about it and don't look for new age flavors -- this is the basic stuff.I'm glad to see this product on the market.

I liked it a lot, very refreshing.Highly recommended.", "\"Funky pyramid shaped teabags are, well, different.  But do they offer better flavor?  Personally, I didn't notice any difference in taste, as compared to the usual Lipton \"\"flow-through\"\" teabags.  It is a decent cup of tea, but I'd have to say I'd favor the original Lipton bag.Why?  Three reasons.  The first is that the pyramid bags are rather bulky.  I can fit about 50 regular bags in my \"\"tea tin\"\", but probably no more than 25 of the pyramid bags.  Secondly, while the regular bags come in a paper envelope, the pyramid bags do not, meaning that a) they're open to the air (which I've always equated to loss of flavor/staleness) and b) they leave \"\"tea dust\"\" all over the place when you handle them.  Thirdly, the pyramid shape makes them hard to \"\"wring out\"\" when you remove them from the cup.  I don't know about you, but I always squeeze the living daylights out of the bag when I take it out--these pyramid bags are slippery little devils that won't stay on the spoon and there's no paper sleeve to squeeze them with so you get a \"\"hot thumb!\"\"I'd give these LIPTON PYRAMID TEA BAGS a tepid THREE STARS.  It's a decent cup of tea, but \"\"novelty\"\" seems to be the only plus the bag has going for it, which is far outweighed by the negatives.  If you want to impress your friends and make them think you're a tea connoiseur, then they might be worth the extra cost, otherwise, I'd recommend the regular Lipton tea bags.\"", "Lipton English Breakfast Tea is made from premium cut black tea, long Ceylon and Kenya leaves, according to the labeling on the package. 2 to 3 cups of this tea per day would provide 150 mg of flavonoids which are supposed to contribute to a healthy heart. So how does this tea taste? It tastes milder than English Breakfast Teas that I've had in the past but still very good. I think it tastes pretty much like the original Lipton Orange Pekoe tea that I've been drinking for years and years. So although I don't think it tastes like I would have expected, I still like it.One thing that is rather unique about this tea is the pyramid shaped tea bags. They are made from food grade nylon or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which are two of the safer plastics as far as leaching anything into the tea. From what I've read, this is the same material used in plastic drinking bottles. The pyramid shape keeps the teabag open on the three sides for water to flow through so the tea seems to brew more quickly. The tag and string on the bags is lightly attached to the side of the bag when you take it out of the box so the tags and strings don't get tangled. You just lightly pull it away from the bag when you're ready to use it. I think it's a very nice design and a lot of thought went into it.", "I have been sipping tea since I was a baby and most of them I love with a few exceptions. I made a big jug of this a few days ago and I am still enjoying. I usually make it strong which is the way that I like it.
