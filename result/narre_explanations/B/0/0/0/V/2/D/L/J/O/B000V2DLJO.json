{"reviews": ["\"This is quite a nice little product for anyone who'd like some exfoliation and a smoother skin. Is it \"\"anti-aging\"\"? I'm not so sure.You get a little \"\"wand\"\" and 12 puffs (with cleanser built in). Just stick one of the puffs onto the wand, wet it, turn on the wand (it vibrates) and rub it gently in circles on your face. Afterward, rinse well.The first time I used this, I couldn't believe how incredibly smooth the skin on my face felt. (It did leave my very fair skin slightly reddened, though, so I would recommend using this at night, rather than as part of your morning routine.)I've been using this faithfully three times a week, as directed, and my skin definitely looks smoother and \"\"glowier.\"\" I don't feel like I look particularly younger, but I'm only 31 and thankfully don't have much in the way of wrinkles, so I may not be the product's target audience.That said, I do think this product is rather pricy, and the replacement puffs seem overly expensive as well. I may stick to a baking-soda scrub after my current supply of puffs runs out. It doesn't work as well, but it's SO much cheaper!\"", "\"This a good product and works as advertised. I am careful about what I apply to my skin and try not to abuse my face with too many chemicals. I take care of it by just cleaning my face every night with water or gentle cleansers and moisturize it regularly. This is a product that I can adopt as it is convenient to use, fast, not at all messy and gives great results.It's simple to use, the abrasive pad sticks on to a head that goes onto the massager wand. Then you turn it on, to the low or high speed setting, and gently massage your face while the abrasive pad does the work to slough dead cells off your face. I found that not pressing too hard is better while moving the hand in circular motion in an upward direction. When you gently massage your face you'll feel a tingling sensation as it gets \"\"rejuvenated\"\" .  I have good skin but it took on a luminous glow after using this product and also felt a little firmer right after the first try. It felt good after a week too, especially right after I use this massager on my face.Applying a good moisturizer right after just adds to the effect. I useOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozwhich is a fabulous, fabulous product. Light, non greasy and makes my skin very smooth and soft.Overall, I love the Nuetrogena Rejuvenator as it is less messier than the other products like the microdermabrasion cream. It also seems to be gentler yet more effective than some other products out there. I'll not be using this wand more than the recommended 2-3 times a week as I've found with previous experience that less is more to maintain  my skin. Due to the abrasive nature of the pads - despite their gentleness - I'll also caution you from using it if you have very sensitive skin or acne prone skin. I do recommend this product if you have healthy skin and want a product which will take care of fine lines that start appearing post 35. I will post an update here after I've used it for a few more weeks.\"", "I was one of the skeptics about this product until I tried it.I did it for the first time last night, and this morning when I woke up, my skin indeed looked fabulously glowy and smooth, even better than a lot of the high-end exfoliation products I'd used!  I could not say enough good things about it, but here is the summary:1. Very easy to operate.2. Facial massage:Despite the instruction that recommends three minutes of use, I did it for 10 minutes because it just feels so good!3. Safe for sensitive and thin skin.Mine is sensitive/thin/dry skin.  With 10 minutes of use, my skin actually took it very well, no redness or peeling at all.4. Multi-function:Yes, I also used it on my neck.  Then, I applied a thick layer of Vaseline lotion onto my neck.5. Amazingly effective:My face/neck visibly and feel smoother, bouncier, more even, less patchy, less red after only one application!I cannot stop touching my skin!!!  It feels so soft and looks so radiant!  I also notice that it absorbs my moisturizer better, which helps a lot with the skin improvement.  I personally use a lot of anti-oxidant products on my face on a daily basis.", "I love beauty products; creams, lotions, scrubs, exfoliators, masks, you name it I love it.  When I saw this Neutrogena product up for grabs I jumped at the chance.  The product makes certain claims, and I have only been using it for about 3 weeks, so I haven't been able to see if it lives up to all the clinical study results, but this is my experience so far.Dermatologist Clinical Study Proves: (as stated on the back of the box)instantly:  91% had smoother, more luminous skin1 Week:  88% had visible improvement in fine lines4 Weeks:  88% had significantly reduced appearance of wrinkles or age spots8 Weeks:  72% had substantial improvement in firmnessThe directions are easy, apply the little puff to the attachment head, press down firmly, wet, and then snap onto the system applicator.  Massage face 1 to 2 minutes.  Rinse face, dry.  Discard puff.With my first use, I confess to not enjoying it.  The vibration made me a little woozy and I felt cross eyed.  It was really rather uncomfortable.  The results however were well worth it.  My face felt so soft and my skin looked fantastic.  So I kept on with the treatments, and after awhile the vibration didn't make me feel sea sick or cross eyed.I have really sensitive skin and a touch of rosacea, so I was afraid it might irritate my skin or make it overly red.  I was pleased that after about 5 minutes the redness caused by the puff went away.In the 3 short weeks I have noticed a big difference with the appearance of my skin, I think it looks healthier, and my pores look fantastic.  My skin has never felt so soft and with that result alone I will keep using the product.  So far I have been impressed and I will continue to use it.", "From the first treatment, my skin felt smooth and soft. The rejuvenating crystals in the buffs aren't harsh and are very gentle on the skin. The treatment feels more like a facial massage and is relaxing. In other words, this is one product I look forwarding to using. The only problem I had was opening the battery compartment. Other than that, this is perfect.", "The experience of using the skin rejuvenator I found most appealing for the sense of relaxation and glamour I felt. The overall sense was of a warm massage for the facial areas - certainly a treat for those like myself who, though well past the age where wrinkles may be expected to evaporate, love a sense of beauty and pampering. It would be an excellent gift - unless, of course, it were given to anyone who'd be insulted at the thought of needing 'rejuvenation.'The product leaves one's skin feeling very smooth and soft, and there is no irritation (as one might have with certain scrubs). The pressure is light - sufficient to give the 'massage' effect, but not at all rough to the touch. Overall, it is a delightful beauty product.", "\"After a rough (literally) start, I'm very well pleased with this item With the first use I attempted to follow directions by massaging for 1 to 2 minutes on a facial area.  Even though I did it for just under a minute because my face began to feel \"\"rubbed,\"\" I experienced chapping and some flaking of skin.  Therefore, I waited several days before additional use.Also, I erred in beginning the massage with my forehead thus some of the solution ran into my eyes, which really stings.The key for me has been to adapt this rejuvenator to my individual skin, and that has produced excellent results.  It has only been a little over two weeks  of regular use and there is definite improvement in tone and smoothness.  I'm eager to see what the result is with continued use.The directions are vague - never mentioning that there are two speeds on the device.  What is each speed recommended for - type of skin, specific area?  And it would be helpful to caution customers about getting the solution into eyes.Having said all of this, I'm impressed by the price, the ease of use, and the salutary effects.- Gail Cooke\"", "Oh this is fantastic! I also own the other face exfoliator from Neutrogena that requires the purchase of a sponge and the exfoliating cream, totaling about $35 for refills of both and while it was a bit messy and it worked okay, it doesn't compare to this! This stuff is truly great, the pods are easy to use, they Velcro in and once wet, massage the face in a seamless manner, I enjoyed the ease and comfort while my face felt like glass. After first use my skin looked like it was air brushed, which is before I even applied makeup.In fact, okay this sounds crazy, but my boyfriend asked me if I need to take a pregnancy test because I had this ethereal glow on my face. I had to break it to him that it was a face scrub! Sounds ridiculous but it made me laugh, this is one product where I feel for once will not disappoint me. This really produced results, I haven't seen my face this clear ever. Another thing is how often this can be used, I no longer have to wait days to have this smooth skin, not to mention my face serum and cream sinks in like a dream, waking up with clear and smooth skin with a glow is so easy now.- Kasia S.", "My wife and I have both used this and really like the results.  There was a noticable glow and we had a more even complexion right after the first treatment.  There are several of these products out there but this one is nice because the the pads have the cream built into them...just add water.  Another we have requires you apply the abrasive mixture before using, then clean the spongy pad afterwards, a pain.  With this one you just remove the old pad and rinse, very easy.  I am not sure what replacement pads cost, but considering what you'd pay at the dermatologist or beauty salon, you are still getting a better deal.  The pads foam up nicely and you can really feel it working.  My wife and I both liked the scent of the the solution, not too harsh.If I had to nitpick the only drawbacks would be the requirement to buy new pads after the initial supply runs out, the fact that the liquid can run into your eyes, and that the vibrations might be a bit too strong for some.  I personally liked it though.  It was hard to open the battery door the first time, but once you get it, then it is fairly easy after that.Those are minor nitpicks though.  If you want an easy to use, relatively inexpensive and effect battery powered dermabration tool, then I doubt you could do better without spending much much more!  In fact, I am going to go give myself another treatment right now!  ;']", "\"I have used the Retin A for about 20 years and occassionally have the typical problems with skin flaking.  I bought this product at Target and use it 3-4 times a week. It is great.  It is gentle enough that it doesn't cause problems with my sensitive skin because of the prescription cream, and it does a great job of getting rid of the dry layer.  My skin really looks better than it has in years.  I get the refill puff that you attach from Amazon's \"\"subscribe and save\"\" unit.  You can find it under search.  They send a box every two months, automatically, there is a discount for buying it from \"\"subscribe and save\"\" and they don't charge for shipping!  If you do a search for the product and the subscribe and save it should show up.  Sorry to turn this into a commercial for that program :~)\"", "\"Want a better complexion in the New Year?  This little kit, might just be the way to get it.The kit, which is used for home microdermabrasion (aka power-exfoliating) comes with an applicator (machine which runs on 2AA batteries, which are provided), and 12 puffs which contain ultra-fine exfoliating crystals and \"\"mild purifiers\"\".It's easy to use. The puffs attach to the machine-head, via a velcro-like substance, then you wet them, and gently go over each area of your face for about two minutes. (Go easy!) When you're finished, you'll see a better tone to your skin (blood circulation is up, so you'll be slightly pink), and your skin will feel noticeably smoother.I gave this just a one-time use, so I can't report on what long-term results will be. But so far, it's a nice cleaning and exfoliating system.If you use a scrub regularly, I think you'll enjoy the novelty of using the machine. But I gave it four stars instead of five because:--cost of the batteries and replacement pads will be more than your usual trusty tube of facial scrub.--simple is good, and that old tube of scrub can be left in the shower, and used regularly.--\"\"old-fashioned\"\" scrubs require just your hands. The machine part is novel, but I don't think my face felt any better than when I used a certain apricot-scrub that comes in a tube.If you like gadgets, you'll like this. If you just want better skin, any good scrub will do.\"", "Did you know the Earth Therapeutics foam applicators fit AND their micro-exfoliation cream works well with this device?Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment PackGreen Tea Cellular Renewal Micro-Exfoliation CreamThey do I use them and the results are great!I have one of these, love it but refuse to buy the ridiculously priced discontinued refills. I've been finding ways to get more life out of the device since the line has been discontinued and replacements/refills are scarce.UPDATE: 9/7/2011Neutrogena recently started selling aNeutrogena Microdermabrasion Systemthat's a newer version of this item for TWENTY BUCKS or less ANDNeutrogena System Refill Puffs - 24 Countfor EIGHTEEN BUCKS or less! The best thing is the new pads fit this Rejuvenator, older Microdermabrasion Systems and the Wave systems too!!!", "\"I absolutely love, love, love this thing.  I'll admit, scrubbing my face with this has become an absolute addiction, but my skin looks so glowing and everyone notices how fresh-faced I am after using it.Nothing can compare to professional scrubbing and microdermabrasion, but this thing works great for in-between to get excellent results from an at-home kit.  I find that this scrubber gives me better results than the at-home microdermabrasion kit.I love how soft and silky smooth the \"\"soap\"\" on these pads leaves my skin and it smells wonderful, too.  I have sensitive skin and this has reduced my breakouts, significantly.Please, NEVER discontinue this item.  It is my favorite beauty product on the market and I adore it.  Every woman should give this a try.  (My husband loves it, too)\"", "My wife was the main user for this product, and liked the feeling, but doesn't think it lives up entirely to the hype.First of all, the packaging was nice, and it was a nice touch that they decided to include batteries.  The cleaning puffs work very well and leave skin feeling fresh.  It is nice that there are different vibration levels, as the highest level felt a bit too much for my wife, but when I tried it was just right for me.  It is a very nice to have this treatment available on a daily basis, which does feel like it cleanses pores and cleans off dry skin.  The only concern my wife raised about the design is that the circular base works well enough but is not easily adaptable to the chin and the upper lips and other curvy areas of the face.Does it really remove wrinkles and age spots?  It may be too soon to tell but after a few weeks it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference.  While it's not magic, the skin rejuvenator does leave skin feeling, well, rejuvenated and fresh.  If nothing else, that's not a bad way to start the day.", "For the most part, this product does what it claims to, providing you follow the directions.  I found it very effective around fine lines of the eyes and on the forehead.  however to see the promised effects you need to use it at least 3 times a week.", "This is my second rejuvenator, and I nearly didn't try it because of my reaction to the first one.  That one got thrown away within days because it relied on a cr&egrave;me containing aluminum oxide, a product I definitely don't want on my skin but couldn't get off.This one is different. Rather than a sticky cr&egrave;me, the puffs that do the work are filled with a gentle soap that easily washes away. Even after the first use, the rejuvenator leaves skin feeling smooth and much softer.Now - will it actually leave skin firmer after a couple of months' use? That remains to be seen. And to be absolutely certain, I think you'd need to compare before and after photos. However, the Neutrogena site has a page about the clinical results from using this machine that are very promising.Overall, a good product that will exfoliate and leave your skin feeling good! I'll add more after 8 weeks to let you know if my skin is actually firmer.By the way, I had no trouble finding replacement pads at my local Wal-Mart. Of course, you can also order them from Amazon.com.UPDATE: July 21, 2008I've been conducting an experiment the last two months, using the Rejuvenator on one forearm every other day and not on the other.  Then I compare the two to see what, if any differences there may be.There are a lot!1.  There is a major difference in sagging and wrinkling between the two arms.  The Rejuvenator definitely works to improve skin and rebuild collagen.2.  There is a clear difference in skin tone.  Freckles on the treated arm are somewhat less noticeable than on the untreated arm. Color is much more even on the treated arm.3.  There is a clear difference in the smoothness of skin with the treated arm being much silkier and smoother than the untreated arm.I have proved to myself that the Rejuvenator works, and works better than any of the hugely expensive potions and lotions I've tried.  Do your own experiment.  You may be as impressed as I am.", "For those that like to pamper themselves, this is the product for you.  There is a noticeable difference right away that won't go unnoticed by your friends.  The treatments are soothing and feel good.  The one problem is the price and that the refills are and extra twenty dollars every other month on top of that when you run out (this comes with a one month supply).  But for those whose price is never an option when it comes to the best skin products, you will get your money's worth here.", "I was really looking forward to trying this, but it unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations.It was easy to put together and worked fine. I didn't find it too harsh but I think I might be allergic to the soap as I got a rash after my second use.It would be nice if the puff were soap free and  you could use your cleanser of choice. Also the refills look really hard to get, Amazon has them on backorder as does other internet sites I checked.If I hadn't had a reaction to the cleanser I would have liked this, it's a good product for the price.", "Neutrogena's 'Healthy Skin Rejuvenator' does exactly what it sets out to do - gives your facial skin a healthy and invigorating dermabrasion-esque scrub for pennies on the dollar from the comfort of your own home.  Setting this up couldn't be easier and Neutrogena includes everything you need to get started right out of the box including 2 AA batteries and 12 Rejuvinating Puff Pads.  The device has 2 settings - low and high.  I found the low setting to be perfectly adequate in giving your face the needed scrub over without feeling too overpowered.  My personal opinion is that the high setting was a bit extreme but feeling slightly knotted up on my shoulders that day as a result of some long racquetball sessions I applied the rejuvinator (sans puffs of course) to my muscles and found the device to also function very well as a portable massage device.  This 2 for 1 functionality makes this product a good value in my book.", "My biggest concern when trying this product is that it would leave my extremely sensitive skin very red and enflamed afterwards. I was surprised after the first use of this product. My skin was polished and silky! I was delighted by the results. Any dead or dry skin was buffed off and my skin looked luminous. My only negative comment is that I had to quickly apply a moisturizer as it left my skin tight.I couldn't be happier with the end result of this product however and I will continue to use it as part of my daily facial program.", "\"I'm a guy. So ladies, you can move on to another review of this product...because though we all have skin, the genders approach taking care of it in different ways, have different goals, and have different limits to what they'll put up with.Using this product for 1 to 2 minutes on each facial area is time consuming. It just doesn't fit into my morning or evening toilette. I chose to do it in the morning & was nearly late for work each time. The first time I used it, I thought my skin felt like it was a canvass ready for make-up. (So ladies, if you are still reading & that's what you want: buy!)After using it as instructed, I have to say I'm not impressed. I don't think my skin is rejuvenated or more radiant. Using it on my face was reminiscent of a ride on a wooden roller-coaster. It leaves you kind of dizzy & light headed (so two stars for the nice head-trip). It really just vibrates the little pad. So I'd say it's the perfect machine for anyone with a broken wrist or those with carpal tunnel syndrome so bad they can't rub a pad across their face.Katherine Helmond's character in the movie \"\"Brazil\"\" would probably use this and like it.\""], "A": [0.05015812814235687, 0.022244786843657494, 0.055211588740348816, 0.040170326828956604, 0.05818216875195503, 0.06489106267690659, 0.04675492271780968, 0.05169595032930374, 0.03972679749131203, 0.02843259833753109, 0.03072516806423664, 0.04963986575603485, 0.03897877410054207, 0.05605931207537651, 0.06334830075502396, 0.02693212404847145, 0.06474008411169052, 0.05966583639383316, 0.05193202570080757, 0.060849547386169434, 0.039660628885030746]}
