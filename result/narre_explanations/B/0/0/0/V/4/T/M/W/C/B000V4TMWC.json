{"reviews": ["\"The Magellan Triton 400 is a very easy to use GPS with most of the features and functionality you would expect to find on higher priced units.  My needs in a handheld GPS are fairly basic since we are casual hikers, however we do live very close to the Appalachian Trail in an area that has a lot of side trails, some of which are poorly marked. On two recent occasions my son and I have lost the main trail and have traversed some very heavy forest heading in what we considered to be the general direction of our entry point. With the Triton 400, this would not have happened as the unit's auto trail clearly shows where you have been.Here are my observations on the device:Likes -* Very fast satellite acquisition* Accurate speed and distance readings (as measured in my car)* Very nice color screen* Basic menu functions are easy to navigate* Uses standard AA batteries* Includes USB cable for connecting to PC* Good companion PC program (VantagePoint)* Supports GeoCachingDislikes -* Preinstalled map is VERY basic (better maps are available for sale)* No written manual (on included CD, but it doesn't do much good in the field)* Small internal memory (but does support SD cards)The VantagePoint software installed fine on my 64 bit Vista PC and it provided an easy to use interface to the GPS. It was handy to have the PC show my Waypoints that I set on the GPS. Since a lot of the other reviewers mentioned that their firmware needed to be updated due to stability issues (which I did not experience), I used the VantagePoint's \"\"Magellan Update\"\" feature to confirm that both the VanatagePoint software and the GPS firmware were already at the most current levels.As noted above, my main concern with the Triton 400 is very basic preinstalled map. It only shows the most major roads (Interstates) and not much else. The Magellan website has plenty of maps for sale, but they do tend to be somewhat pricy. A related issue is the small internal memory that is only large enough to hold the default map, so you will likely need to install an SD card. It should be noted that some of the maps can be ordered preloaded on an SD card so all you would need to do is insert the card and enter the GPS configuration menu to tell it to use the new map.This is a very solid GPS, both physically and functionally, that meets my needs. If you need more detailed maps or topo maps, you need to consider the cost of adding them at a later time.Recommended, with the above caveats.\"", "I have a hubby who loves to geocache, and he's adoring this thing. Being able to save locations in memory is extremely useful. Could use a more detailed map (common for basemaps in this product genre), and it has crashed at least once for no particular reason (solved with a simple restart) but is very accurate, chock full of features and locks on solid to satellites even under significant tree coverage (and once under the upper deck of a parking garage!)The screen is beautiful and very easy to read in sunlight. *Just* shy of five stars for the (minor) software issues.", "First off, know what you're getting. Many of the lowest ranking reviews are simply because the reviewer expected a GPS that would help them drive around the city or walk around town. This GPS is absolutely not for this purpose.Second thing you need to know, when you open the box, the thing is next to useless until you load some topographical maps (beyond the extremely basic one included) into it. There are free ones as well as maps you can purchase depending on your desired use. This process is pretty easy, but not at all intuitive nor painless. This would take a pretty techy guy 20-45 minutes to do. My dad and grandpa would never have a hope of figuring it out as it involves their computer and quite a few steps. You'll also want to do a firmware update to solve some of the crashing issues (so I've heard from other reviews; after my firmware upgrade I have not had issues with crashing).After you get it going, it will take you about 30 minutes to an hour to figure out what most of the icons mean and how to navigate the menus. (It will probably take you a day or two of pretty heavy use to become near proficient at it...the Triton was not intuitive according to my experience).But then, you'll have a handheld GPS that you'll probably like to use for things like hiking, hunting, boating, and golfing. If you drop it, it keeps working (Mine fell out of the car onto the asphalt from about 4 feet and suffered no ill effect). Magellan says you can have it in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. I didn't want to risk trying it. The unit truly is handheld and pretty ergonomic. The screen quality is acceptable. Overall, I am greatly underimpressed by this unit. It is useless for driving and in the city use (which would greatly increase its usefulness). It performs only the basic functions of a GPS (waypoint marking, route marking, geocaching, etc). It doesn't seem to do anything remarkably better than GPS units available 10 years ago (with the exception of support for some of the upgraded maps) that you could pick up used for a fraction of the price.Nevertheless, if you are looking for a topographical-only, rugged, and durable new handheld unit, this may be for you.", "I see all the bad reviews of this product and wonder what's wrong with me because I was able to get it up and running without pain. I'm a neophyte when it comes to handheld GPS units; I use the one in my car a lot, and I am pretty good with a computer. I had the software installed, updated, and the firmware updated with no problems, and quickly. After that, the little GPS works great for my needs. It reads the satellites quickly and is very accurate, even inside. I can trace my steps around the inside of my house with it. The map that comes with it is limited, but you can buy others, and in fact there was a special included with this one that allowed me to download my choice of one free map. I use this on short hikes, mostly, to record my distance, and also on the bicycle. It is the perfect size and shape to fit my hand, very comfortable to hold, and it seems sturdy. It's a bright color so it's easy to find in a backpack or purse. I plan to also use it walking around unfamiliar cities--even if every street isn't mapped, I know I will always be able to set my starting point (hotel, for example) and get back there without fail.I really like this little GPS!", "I've always wanted a hand held GPS and I have to say that I'm not at all disappointed with the Magellan. It's very user friendly and fun to use. I also have a Tom Tom that I bought for my husband but we both prefer the Magellan. I did notice that the Magellan had quite a few bad reviews, all of which were probably done before the software updates because I've not had any problems with it at all.", "\"Magellan came out with this series of Triton's with the great idea that they were the only GPS handheld manufacturer that could download USGS maps at 1:24,000 scale to a SD Disk in the unit (only models 400 and up).  Their website states all the software they are compatible with.  It has been a miserable failure.  Thousands of these handhelds have been returned due to software and connectivity problems, which is a real shame.  I personally have gone through four Triton's and have the same problem every time.  It simply will not connect to my PC.  The satellite signals work great even in my home and I can easily move about any region and can even take Magellan's software (called VantagePoint) and incorporate waypoints, trails, geocache's, etc. with no problem.  But this is only on my PC.  After literally hours (probably over ten) with support in the Philippines and Florida, I could not get anyone to resolve my connectivity problem.  The computer recognized new hardware through my USB port, but when I tried to connect it, it got stuck on, \"\"waiting to connect\"\".  My drivers were fine, so I knew it was not my PC.This is a real tragedy for Magellan, as the idea to download USGS at a finer scale is fantastic, but it just isn't working out.  The other features are fine - as good as Garmin or most manufacturers.  However, I just cannot recommend this product after all the time, money and hassle I went through.  Go with Garmin.  You might have to settle for the pre-loaded map SD chips at a larger scale ratio, but at least you'll know where you are coming and going.\"", "UPDATE 11-30-2009: I initially gave this unit a rating of 3 stars. I am upgrading it to 4 stars because of a firmware upgrade that vastly improved the speed of the unit and eliminated issues I saw with VantagePoint. That said, I am leaving my original write-up intact.---I am an avid geocacher, and I have other hand-held units by Garmin and DeLorme. I have never used a Magellan GPS though I have friends who have used an Explorist for years with reasonable results. I was anxious to try out this unit to see if Magellan puts out a good product. In a nutshell, it is a mixed bag though overall the Triton 400 is a nice unit.This is a very small unit, a little smaller than my Garmin eTrex Legend which is a fairly simple unit. Small is not necessarily a bad thing. It fits nicely in a pocket or a stash bag, being about the size of a cell phone.The display is small too and people who want a large display will not like this unit. That said, the display is very bright, crisp and clear, everything being quite visible and readable. It had, in my opinion, the best general display of the units I have used, surpassing even the DeLorme in display quality.Once the unit is powered on, it quickly starts finding satellites. Though it switches to navigation mode quickly, it is important to remember that the unit may or may not have a good lock on satellites - it may still be acquiring more. Be cautious in this regard, until used to using this unit.The Triton has small buttons. I have big fingers. Surprisingly, this does not seem to be an issue, as I have not yet had the misfortune of mis-keying anything.Several reviewers have complained that the menu system on the Triton is confusing, unintuitive and hard to use. I did not find this to be the case. I can simply say they are different than Garmin's implementations. That is neither good nor bad - just, different. Once used to them, this unit is no less intuitive than any other unit.Navigation is straightforward and easy. When navigating I have found the unit to be on par with my Garmin GPSMap 60CSx, which is usually fairly accurate. I've no complaints in this regard.My disappointment with the Triton mostly involve what's [not] in the box and the software that the computer uses to interact with it. There is a single CD in the box that includes PDF versions of the manual. There are no printed manuals in the box, at all. This is ok, but other units include a manual so it would be nice if this one did too. There is also a link to the website where you can download Vantage Point, the software for working with the unit. The software is 42MB, and I am on dial-up. Even including an older version would have been nice since there is plenty of room on the CD for it...When the software is loaded on a Windows Vista machine, system behavior becomes very sluggish, mouse movement being choppy and COM port communications getting interruptions - enough interruptions to disconnect from the Internet. Though the software has eye appeal and offers a lot of functionality for dealing with the GPS, it drips of slowness. When sending caches to the unit, it sends at a rate of about 1 every 5-10 seconds, which means sending 500 at a time would take a good deal of time. That said, geocache information stops a little shy of being a paperless solution - the unit retains description, terrain/difficulty, owner and hint information, but it does not offer previous logs, sizes or other important bits of information. It's a good reference in the field but not sufficient to go true paperless.Though there is a place on the bottom of the unit for a lanyard, it is disappointing that there is none in the box.One area of real concern for me is the connection interface for the unit. The connector on the unit is exposed and uncovered, with nothing to keep it from getting dirty. If nothing else there should be a rubber flap over it, or a cover, or *something*.This is actually a nice unit, with a decent feature set and good accuracy. Magellan cut some corners and left out some details that keep this from being a great unit. The technology is there. The design is there. The details are not. Hopefully Magellan will close the gap on these details soon.", "I picked up this GPS for use on my bicycling trips on road and on local trails.  I am not demanding on my bike GPS, and essentially use it as a bicycle computer that tracks distance, pace, etc. while giving me the bonus of an idea where I am (since I have NO innate sense of direction).  Unfortunately, the Magellan Triton is barely adequate for either function.CONS:  The base map lacks all but the most major roads, and could barely figure out where I was in relation to the shore of Long Island Sound.  The satellite acquisition was slower than any of the other GPSes I have owned - even those with lesser chipsets.  The system can't tell you any directions, though it does tell you where you have been.PROS:  The menu system is decent, and with a little experimentation you'll find most of the basic functions without having to go to the manual.  The actual positioning and tracking of distance is excellent - matching other GPSes that I compared it to exactly.  Tracking of speed is also good.Overall, this is fairly useless as a GPS for those with any but the most basic needs.", "Let me first start by saying that YES, you DO NEED to do a software AND firmware upgrade to get this thing to work.  It took me about 10 minutes and a couple tries to upgrade the GPS, and it seems that it actually did two upgrades, a software upgrade AND a firmware upgrade (not sure what the difference is).  I did have to personally turn on and off the GPS a few times to correctly connect it to my PC via the USB connection, as well as having to download the patch from my PC (I believe it was about a 35 MB download).  Also, with respect to some of the specs and features below, I'll admit that I didn't read the slim paper manual or the online manual [actually, it's an offline manual, since it's on the included CD], since I'm sometimes a lazy guy.)PROS:-Nifty color (kind of an earthen red).-Water resistant (don't know the limits, though.  Maybe the manual has actual specs).-Innovative 4 point contact for USB cable, which should be resistant to wind, rain, and dirt.  Instead of a jack, you get 4 contact points on the back of the GPS, and the USB connection (special USB cable included) also has 4 contact points, as well as a screw, to hold the connection in place.  This means no moving parts along the connection, no hole in the jack where stuff can get in, and if there was any dirt, you can easily wipe it off with a bit of spit and polish.-very sturdy buttons, which are rubber coated for this water/dirt resistance.  The thing looks pretty rugged, although I haven't dropped it yet.-VERY Fast and strong reception.  I've had 2 driving GPSs, and neither was able to connect while in my house, but this unit not only was able to connect, but relatively quickly.-SD Card slot.  With today's technology, you can buy a 1 or 2GB SD card for an amazingly low price, so this allows you to put in cheap upgrades (i.e., maps).  Note also that the SD card slot is covered by a pretty tight rubber seal, again protecting the unit and memory from wind and rain and dirt.-uses 2 AA batteries (not included).  Not those expensive lithium or calculator or camera batteries.  I was able to stick in a couple EneloopsSANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries(my favorite), and the machine was ready to go!  Oh, and yes, the battery cover does have a gasket.  Didn't test for how long the batteries last, but I would imagine that it would depend on the type of battery (heavy duty, alkaline, NiCad, NiMH, LSD NiMH like Eneloop), as well as the type of use, since the screen backlight turns off when not in use (there's a button for that on the left side).Room for Improvement (i.e., CONS):-No street map (although it does contain highways and a couple main streets).  Not sure if I can download a full street map, but that would be good, since I can then hand the machine to my kids to follow along as we drive around town and the country.-No battery charger.  Would have been nice if there was a way to charge the batteries though the USB connection (I mean, I can charge a cell phone, my driving GPS, and my Sony Dualshock through a USB connection, so it shouldn't be too hard to add that feature).-Buttons are hard to press.  Basically, the side-effect for such ruggedness, the buttons are covered in rubber, and have to be pressed hard to work.-No touchscreen or keypad, so if you wish to quickly enter coordinates, especially for geocaching, you have to do it via computer.-I wonder if there's a way to download some games on there?  Okay, so this isn't something one should expect from a handheld GPS, but hey, I got kids, so anything to distract them...Despite the room for improvement, I recommend this unit.  Good for a starting geocacher, and someone looking for an entry-level handheld GPS, especially for younger users.", "\"The features are there, but the execution is poor.- SiRF Star III- Impact-resistant (rubber coated plastic)- Water-resistant to IPX-7 standards- Two AA batteriesAnd then you turn it on and realize the 2.2\"\" screen is tiny especially against the whole orange body. Then you are faced with a non-intuitive menu as you try to navigate around with a tiring directional keypad.The Triton 400 is s step up from the lower model by an addition of an SD card slot. Yipee. Other than that, it's  basically the same low-end unit. And at this price, you get what you pay for.This is definitely for the outdoor person in you, but there is a steep learning curve in using and navigating around this Triton series versus the usual touch-screen vehicle GPS devices with a larger and brighter screen.If you do take the time to make use of it, then I recommend downloading the Magellan Vantage Point software for a better way of planning your route and setting waypoints. And while you're at it, you can purchase the National Geographic topographic maps for a more detailed map on a specific area.Neat features not found on conventional GPS include an electronic compass, sunrise/sunset information, and elevation.But I don't have the patience to navigate thru this clunky menu and slow software because I want to enjoy my hike more than spend time on the handheld GPS.There has got to be a better way. Unfortunately this Triton 400 is not it.\"", "I own many GPS units and I use them in many of my hobbies, especially geocaching.  I am always on the lookout for an entry level unit to recommend to those who are interested in taking up the hobby. In the past I have been telling people that low-end Garmins are the way to go.  Still, I am always willing to try something new.  I have playing with this GPS for a while and I've tried to be optimistic, but I have come to the convolution that there are much better units out there for the money.A basic GPS should be intuitive and should be ready to go right out of the box.  Even with all of my experience I had a hard time figuring out how to use this thing.  Using it for geocaching was problematic to say to least.  If you are looking for a basic, handheld GPS, I suggest that you keep looking.", "\"I was quite excited about the Triton 400.  I got it out of the box, installed the software, patched everything, downloaded the set of free TOPO maps covering different portions of the United States (well, I signed up, waited for the email, and then downloaded and installed them) -- I was, to a degree, a kid on Christmas morning with a new toy.I overlooked (or at least tried to overlook) how clumsy and dated the software was, and how tragically difficult and needlessly frustrating it was to get the device to communicate with my PC.  I didn't worry about the fact that when I first turned the unit on, and waited for what would these days be described as a somewhat painfully slow load process, what I saw was an unmarked beige \"\"map\"\" with an arrow in the middle and nothing more.  As I backed out, and out, and out, finally a landmark appeared, a major highway a few miles away from my location.  Fine, I thought, it's the pre-loaded map, I really was more excited about the TOPO map anyway, it will have all the detail I need.  Like some other reviewers, I plodded around my house, sort of giddy about how the arrow would turn with me, and it would mark the path of my little wanderings from the family room to the kitchen.The realities soon overtook that new toy glee.  First was the realization that I could do nothing whatsoever, at least that day, with my brand new TOPO map.  No, that requires a separate memory card.  Sure these cards are cheap, sure they're easy to come by, isn't that all the reason Magellan needs to just include a small one so that you can use this device out of the box?  And that's the seed that provoked this rather unhappy review.  In a day where virtually anyone with a smart phone has access to Google maps and the like, and the new iPhone 3Gs models come complete with compass capability, what does a handheld GPS like this really have to offer?  It's waterproof, I hear you say.  Yes, yes it is.  It's shock resistant, I hear you say.  Indeed it is.  It's a rather natty shade of orange, easy to find if you drop it in the brush.  Yep, you're right again.  Here's what it's not though, at least not right out of the box; useful.  The software IS dated and clunky.  The unit itself IS slow.  You're back out to the store to buy a memory card to load a useful map (maybe the preloaded map is more detailed where you live, I'm in a state capital here, but it is Ohio, so maybe the joke is that there's really nothing to see in the mid-west anyway).Doesn't it deserve more than one star, you ask?  You know, 5 or 10 years ago, this is a WOW device, with WOW software.  Today?  Reviewing it is a bit like being asked to give a critical opinion of an average outhouse, while being accustomed to all the trappings of 'modern' plumbing and toiletry.  I'm just unimpressed.  Maybe I've missed the point, maybe I just don't have a real need for what this niche product has to offer, and perhaps that will make my observations valueless for those with different requirements.  All possible, perhaps even probable -- but my purpose here is to invite people, before purchase, to consider whether or not their needs may be better served elsewhere.Will this be a serviceable GPS for folks who just want something to track hikes and rides?  Absolutely.  Chances are, however, your cell phone will do the job just as well (even if you have to buy an app to do it).  I just can't bring myself to give this device anything more than the minimum score, when the reality is that the cost of this unit falls well short of what it delivers, against the wide range of alternative GPS solutions available in today's market.  I'm not saying that it makes sense to take your 3Gs camping and kayaking.  I am saying that if you're going to drop this sort of money on a GPS to do just that, then it better be ready to go right out of the box.This one is not.\"", "\"The first thing to know about the \"\"Magellan Triton 400 Handheld'Navigation System\"\" is that it is strictly a hiking GPS.  There are no'street maps, and it won't plot any courses for you if you are planning'on taking a trip.  I don't have an iPhone, but I have seen friend's'iPhones and I know what they are capable of, and it was too bad that'this dedicated device didn't have similar capabilities.It also doesn't work as a car navigator. I got this for use on a'camping trip to Lake Wenatchee in Washington I had planned with my'wife, so the first thing I did was input our destination, only to have'the GPS draw a straight line across the map from point A to point B.'Not exactly useful if you are driving a car and have to follow roads...Actually, let me back up a bit.  That wasn't the first thing, because'when I first turned the Triton on it located me some thousand miles'away in California for some reason, even though I was sitting on my'back porch in Washington.  A quick \"\"turn off/turn on\"\" solved that'problem and I was firmly located where I should be.  Always the'quickest, best solution for electronic gadgetsSo it was useless for urban and car navigation, which was too bad, but'turned out to be a great tool for hiking.  The Magellan Triton can'record your hikes, which can then be saved if you want to walk the'same trail again, or just as a memory for where you have been.  If'you are trying to get to a specific destination, this GPS will keep'you in the general direction of your course without drawing you a'path. If you are a geocacher, then I think you will have a lot of fun'with this.The Magellan Triton is a very sturdy device and will hold up to some'banging and even some wetness.  It is about the size of a cell phone,'so doesn't take up too much room in a pocket or pack.  You might need'to bring an extra set of batteries along if you plan to be gone for'while.  The signal definitely gets weaker as'the batteries fade, and'the functions begin to fail.All in all, I think I would have preferred a more multi-functional'device, one that is helpful in an urban setting as well as the great'outdoors.  Otherwise, as a dedicated hiking GPS it is decent withoutbeing spectacular.\""], "A": [1.003424685563914e-07, 0.00034975752350874245, 6.917805706052604e-08, 2.0776525389010203e-08, 0.06444438546895981, 9.950674211722799e-06, 1.3096870838234849e-19, 0.2168835550546646, 0.7177028059959412, 8.77877948113337e-09, 1.0684679807582143e-09, 0.0006075716228224337, 1.820296461119142e-06]}
