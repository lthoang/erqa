{"reviews": ["This game could have been amazing, but is hampered by relatively clunky/awkward movement and controls. I recently played Silent Hill 1 for the PsOne and thought it controlled better than this game. With that aside, this game is a very fun ACTION game.. Don't expect this to be your typical Resident Evil Survival Horror, because it is not. It is much more action based with light survival horror (collecting supplies to survive) and light RPG elements (inventory management and buying/selling equipment at the vendor). I had a blast playing this game and if it wasn't for the controls would be a perfect 5/5 in my eyes. The story is alright but has really no ties to other resident evil besides the main character and the typewriter I guess. They mention raccoon city but just in passing. I paid 19.99 for this in the PSN store for PS3 and don't regret it at all, I just wouldn't go into the game expecting such a great experience like Resident Evil 1,2, and 3.", "This game is the main reason I purchased a PS2, and I'm damn well glad I purchased the system for this thrilling masterpiece. Before RE4, I struggled with the past numbered entries. I enjoyed them, but they were frustrating as hell. RE1: Why are there so many locked doors?! Why can't fight off a zombie when he tries to eat me? Ugh... SO MUCH CRAP TO FIND! RE2: Who the hell builds a police station like this?! There shouldn't be this many locked doors and passageways in a police station! Damn you lickers and zombie dogs! RE3: Ahhh!! GO AWAY NEMESIS, GO AWAY! Run Jill Valentine run, you slow b**ch! DAMMIT! I'm dead from a f***ing rocket launcher... FANTASTIC. But RE4 completely rebuilt the franchise from scratch and gave it new life. If you didn't play RE4 solely for the fact you had many troubles with the past entries. Worry not, this entry has eased the difficulty by miles and it's paced far better than the past entries. This means those long moments of nothing are pretty much eliminated.WHAT THE GAME IS: This game is a mix between survival-horror and third-person shooter, though it feels more like a third-person shooter. Leon Kennedy (The guy from RE2 and he had a brief role in Gaiden) has been sent on a mission to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter; Ashley Graham; in an obscure part of what appears to be Spain. During his mission there, the villagers attack and attempt to kill Leon. It also turns out these villagers are infected with something. These guys aren't the rotting corpses you remember from the old RE games, these guys are meaner and more deadly. He must find the source of the outbreak and look for the secrets surrounding a mysterious organization that operates there.GRAPHICS: Who said PS2 visuals are bad? This game looks great and even looks better than some of my Xbox 360 games. Overall, the visuals look great and really know how to milk the PS2 hardware for what it's worth.MUSIC: There is little present most of the time, something I miss from the old RE games because there was always some kind of creepy music in the background. It comes up at key moments but is sadly absent most of the time.SOUND: Shooting, dying screams, chainsaws, and exploding heads.GAMEPLAY: This game introduced the over-the-shoulder camera which works quite well when shooting. The shooting mechanics work well and use the same button layout as the past RE games (R1 to aim, X to fire). You  get to shoot lots of zombies, and ammo is far more plentiful than most likely all the other RE games combined. There is a great selection of weapons to buy or find like guns, rocket launchers, and grenades. There are a bunch of other items to buy in the game as well. This game also has an upgrades system in which for a fee of some sort you can have your weapons upgraded to enlarge fire power and how much ammo a weapon can carry. But be warned the item compression system from the old RE games is still here, meaning you can only carry a certain number of items. This item compression system is at least far better than the old ones, allowing you to carry a large number of items before running out of room. You can also buy another box if you find your current one too small. This game also has a lot more health recovering items as well. You can even shoot fish and eat them along with chicken eggs to heal you. This game's main focus; shooting; works very well and the targeting system is among the most reliable I've ever used in a game. This game has great boss battles that are carefully balanced and heart-racing. This game relies on some timed button press scenes like the boulder scene or dodging some other large object that's coming at you. One part of the game I found rather surprising was the escort mission. All gamers pretty much hate escort missions because the person you're protecting is annoying and you'd rather see them die than let them live because it would just be a burden. Not in this game. The escort mission wasn't tedious or frustrating at all, and it was quite nice for a change to protect someone who isn't annoying as hell. Puzzles are cleverly devised in this game, and can be real brain-teasers at times and they weren't boring to solve. Every part of the gameplay is polished to perfection and can't really think of a way to knock off points against it. GO BUY THIS GAME NOW.OVERALL: This game is a superb and phenomenal and the gameplay is perfect.THE GOOD: Perfect gameplay, lots of guns, lots of zombies, lots of ammo, lots of health recovery, great story, an escort mission that doesn't suck, it's thrilling, good boss battles, great characters, and great graphics.THE BAD: The lack of music is the only thing that's wrong with this game.", "I was excited when I first bought this game but after beating it 3 times. And unlocking everything I really don't want this game anymore", "This could be the start of an interesting new phenomenon: double dipping video games, just like double dipping dvd's. First, Resident Evil 1-3 and Code Veronica X were ported from PSOne to GC. (Veronica actually went from Dreamcast to PS2 to GC) RE1 was totally redone, the other 3 were exactly the same as the previous version.Well, transferring RE4 from GC to PS2 proved to be a step in the right direction. The graphics are exactly the same as on GC. Separate Ways was lots of fun, so was the movie gallery, and new weapons and costumes. It is definately worth it to buy this game for PS2.", "This is the first Resident Evil game I've tried and was quite surprised that the controls were this poor. I had heard nothing but positive reviews on RE4. Most all of them containing remarks on how they finally got the controls right in contrast to eariler RE games. Those earlier games must of been close to completely unplayable. But you'll have to excuse me I guess. I just finished playing games like Halo, Halo 2, FarCry, and many other recent 1st person and 3rd person action games whose controls are flawless or close to it. There is really no excuse in this day and age to have controls this horrible. If the controls were done this way on purpose to heighten the suspense or something, perhaps the makers of this game should have just simply made a better game to accomplish this. Poor controls = No Fun.", "if you are thinking about picking this up i'd go for the nintendo gamecube version over this one. the graphics look much better and it plays smoother on the 'cube (plus playing on the gamecube means you can use the best video game accessory ever made= the ultra-dope wavebird wireless controller) . the game was designed for the gamecube, and the weird architecture of the ps2 didn't help the shifting over from that console. the game itself is fantastic but be aware that it is much better on the gamecube.", "Zombie-shooting games have always been a blast, but the Resident Evil series is known as the ULTIMATE zombie-shooting experience.  And for good reason: these games RULE.Resident Evil 4 is definitely the best in the series when it comes to incredibe graphics and blood and gore.  Everything looks so BIG compared to Resident Evil 2 and 3.  Walking around shooting the zombie people is really awesome because the graphics really make the game an incredible sight.  The zombies have never looked more impressive.I've never seen so much violence in my life.  The way blood splashes all over the place and the way zombies basically EXPLODE after you pump them with bullets is truly a wonderful experience.  Some battles have a required strategy in order to complete, which didn't happen much in the previous RE games.  NOT recommended for children, or anyone under the age of 13.", "Resident Evil has seen many highs and lows in the years since its' debut on the Playstation in 1996. I, personally, lost interest in the series after RE3:Nemesis. While I played RE: Code Veronica X, it just seemed to me it was the same ol' same ol' all over again. So, I went with Silent Hill for awhile because of its' fresh approach to survival horror. Sadly, it, too, began to regurgitate the same ol' formula with it's PS2 games so I gave up on games of this nature altogether. So, recently, my nephew comes over to play videogames with me and brings his copy of Resident Evil 4. Leaving it behind when he leaves to go home, I find it and decide to take a look at the game. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I got sucked into the game and played for hours on end. See, with this installment of Resident Evil, the series goes into a bold new direction with a greater emphasis on the story. If you're wondering how, all I can say is to check it out.The story itself has Leon Kennedy(whom RE Vets will remember from RE2) searching for the President's daughter in a remote European village where she was supposedly spotted. Yet, instead of facing zombies like in previous Resident Evil games, Leon faces a threat far greater than that. A threat that is genuinely creepy and very unsettling.While many of you know this game was originally released on the Nintendo Gamecube, it was successfully ported over to the Playstation 2 with several new extras(such as Ada Wong's Separate Ways sidestory, new outfits & whatnot). Very little was sacrificed in the making of this game and it shows. The game looks absolutely stunning(measuring up to the graphical style of Silent Hill and then some) and the gameplay is as perfect as it can be. Resident Evil 4 is a fine return to form as the leading Survival Horror game on the Playstation 2. I highly recommend you play this game.For me, I'm gone....out to buy Resident Evil 4. Later you all.", "This was an awsome game. This game was real fun, leon had to find ashley thorugh the horrific mission he was in. As the story continued he had to battle not zombies but people with viruses, he had to fight he's way through a creepy yet thrilling mission to find ashley. When i first played this game it was great from the begining, it starts of with leon driveing a car with 2police men then they let leon out and leon explored the woods thinking he was not alone, he went inside a house a found a man that wanted to kill him but that did'nt happen. The 2police officers were being attacked by the people with viruses then there car crashed in the water, leon went outside to wonder what was going on then the people with the viruses was trying to attack him but luckly he had a gun. He then walked over to where the crash was and he found the car but the 2police men were not in it either he was thinking they were flushed away by the water or the people took them. Continueing the story he was walking he's way out the woods but more of the people came and wanted to kill him but leon was loaded with action and got through in anything that stood in he's way, he then came out the woods and founded the 2police officers hanging on a branch burning, then he new their was shelters around him with the people with the viruses in them, then a chainsaw guy came in the party but leon fought he's way through him to. He went inside a shelter and pushed something to hold the door then he ran upstairs then found a shotgun a grenads the people used the latters to get upstairs were he was but he jumped out the window and was waiting for them to show, killing one by one on the roof, after he got passed that part he went to a door and saw a symbol hole, the could'nt open without the symbol in place of the door so he had to find a way to get the symbol. He saw a door he did'nt no was there then opened it and he was in a farm and fought he's way through to get passed then he opened another door and he was in a graveyard and the people with the viruses were there to. Their was a symbol on the door like the other one but different shape, so he walked over the brige and the people were their trying to attack him but he got passed, he opened a door and the people relesed a big ugly monster to kill leon that part was fun. Leon was shooting the monster then a dog came and distracted the monster giving leon the chance for advantege to attack withoutthe monster seeing him. Their's more but this was a great fun game.", "I'm not a Resident Evil junkie. I played Veronica X and dabbled with one of the original ones on the original playstation, and that was about it. But Resident Evil 4 will blow you away.First off, the graphics are fantastic! I bought this the other day and on my day off watching my newborn son, I decided to sit down and play for awhile. Yeah... Awhile was an understatement. My wife got home, asked what I did today and I had nothing... nothing to say except... Resident Evil 4 was fun.This game will scare you. I don't care if you think it won't. It will. I think it's because it builds tension so well. You arrive in a remote community in search of the Presidents daughter and are quickly subdued into the carnage. After you explore the first house, you'll realize how cool of a game you are in.You can slide a dresser in front of the door so people can't get it in. (This is a good idea). You can dive through windows to escape. You have new weapons and the controls are fluid... although you still can't RUN and SHOOT.  You can Run.... stop and shoot... but you can't run and shoot.  That is the only thing I can complain about.I'm not gonna give plot away because half the fun is finding out all the twists that Resident Evil 4 has in store, but I will say... that this is unlike any Resident Evil 4 game you've ever played.Gone is the stiffness of previous Resident Evil games. You have an open environment to explore. Explore how you choose. There are puzzles, but not overwhelming puzzles... this game is mostly about scares and violence.Choose the right time to use your shotgun... sniper rifle with scope... rocket launcher... incideniary grenade... and of course the mystery weapon that I'm still working to get.In Resident Evil 4, you also have to collect jewels so that you can buy goods from the merchant dealer who is a shady character himself. The first time he walks by a window when you're walking down the hallway and says something to you... you'll wonder if you should go or not.Oh... and if you hear a chainsaw? RUN like hell. Seriously.  Great game! Fantastic! I can't wait till I can sit down and play it again.", "Very few games can top resident Evil 4 overall.  I've played God of War and the Prince of Persia games (which both rated high), but as far as I'm concerned, they can't even touch resident Evil 4.  Unlike it's other 'Relative Evil's', Resident Evil 4 focuses much more on action and progression versus finding the key and backtracking.  The enemies are quick and challenging and as Leon Kennedy or Ada Wong, you need SOCOM skills to pull off the kills.  No annoying camera angels to contend with anymore either.  When you aim, the behind the back view goes into over-the-shoulder, making much more sense in the long run.  The atmosphere is extremely engaging, thanks to a great musical score and excellent graphical environments.  It stands up well against it's brother, 'Silent Hill' in terms of atmosphere, where the other 'Evil's' soon became redundant.  The game itself is HUGE.  I kept thinking that soon I'd reach the end and that would be it, but no, the environments just kept expanding.  Even when I did beat it, I got to play a whole new game as Ada Wong and than other game with Ada and even more the Mercenaries Game (which included good old HUNK from Resident Evil 2).  So, as far as replay and game length, this game takes the cake for action games.  As far as the graphics go, I was blown away by how smooth enemies move and how smart the AI is.  No more of the boring zombies that simply lunge at you.  Now, you're up against fast moving angry possessed folks with pitch-forks and chainsaws that chase you down and hunt you from all angles.  It's great that you can actually use the environments to your advantage by pushing crates in front of doors to block enemies, etc.  What's even better is when the enemies start hacking away at the door, trying even harder to kill you, versus waiting outside until you're ready for them.  There's some standard puzzle-fare and a few 'find-the-key, go-back-and-unlock', but the action takes over and forces the game along at a perfect pace.  the character acting is far better than any other game in the series and the story works well to draw away from the Umbrella storyline (which was getting tired anyways).  All in all, this is the BEST Resident Evil Game and as far as I'm concerned, the BEST Playstation 2 game.  If you don't own it (maybe because you hate the Resident Evil series or Survival Horror in general), buy it and try it.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.", "\"I did play Resident Evil 4 on the GC but I never bought it. Then it got ported to the PS2 so I thought hey why not? The game is good regardless so whether you're playing the GC or this version it's still an awesome game regardless. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best game this generation but still.Story: It's a port so it's directly the same but unless you don't know the story I'll fill you in. There's no Umbrella or zombies in this, it's something else entirely. 6 years after Raccoon City got nuked because of the viral outbreak, former rookie officer Leon Kennedy has been assigned a quite important task: protect the President's family. Only Ashley, the daughter, gets kidnapped and spotted in Europe so Leon's on his way only to find that there's something up(of course).Graphics: It's been roughly 9 months since I played the GC version so I can't exactly tell there is a drop but it's not as polished/detailed as the old one but still it's still great graphics. The thing oozes with atmosphere, exploding heads still look great and the back corners of europe look unsettling.Sound/Music: Sound effects and whatnot is excellent. Shotgun blasts definately sound powerful here. Creatures have that unearthly quality while your main enemy here(they're called Ganados but I'm not spoiling what they are) speak spanish and they repeat themselves a bit too much. As for music, it's more ambient than anything, no catchy themes or anything here. But as usual the music really unsettles you to the point where you know something's going to happen but nobody's telling you anything.Gameplay: Nothing's really changed except for 2 new weapons, a new mode featuring, umm, a RE veteran. Detractors of previous RE's(such as myself) couldn't get past one thing: the control scheme. Essentially it was like you drove a tank, regardless of where you were pointing, up was always forward rather than it being 3D controls. This made precious ammo wasted since you couldn't see if you were actually getting anywhere. Well first there's several overhauls: camera is now Splinter Cell-like with a not-quite third person camera. This makes maneuvering and aiming a hell of a lot better. The control setup is still the same but because of the camera perspective it's not as bothersome.There's also plenty of ammo so you're not blindly firing shots. Some might find there's too much ammo actually. I literally had to rearrange my inventory to make it fit. The other overhaul is that in previous RE's, you needed an ink ribbon to save so no ink ribbon, no save. This was quite a problem when you went an hour without saving then bleeh, dead. Another overhaul is that in the old ones, there was a magic box where you stored weapons, ribbons, ammo and such. This connected to others so you never had to go to one such box to get one ammo, a box right next to you would have it. Well not so here because Leon carries an attache case so you get a portable briefcase with customization for it to fit more stuff since guns tend to take up space(with a rocket launcher taking up a good 20 spaces or so.If there's one thing that hasn't changed is the dialogue/voice overs. There just as B-movie as ever. It's hard not to cringe/laugh at lines like \"\"you're right hand comes off?\"\" when he meant a villain's sidekick is rather sad. Voice acting also isn't the best. Hearing Ashley go \"\"Leon!\"\" several times isn't that good for sanity. However it's Resident Evil and you don't play it for Metal Gear Solid voice caliber.The big attraction is Separate Ways, where you play Ada Wong for 5 chapters with a certain goal. They're really quick and I beat all 5 in about 2 and a half hours but mainly it's for fun. For example, why did the church bell ring in the prologue? Or how Ada managed to save Leon from a certain death? It's all here. One thing that sucked is the inventory was extremely limited to at least 4 guns or so and you couldn't even upgrade the stupid things.You should judge the game on the game itself rather than what Capcom did wrong going from Gamecube to PS2 so if you don't judge it, you'll find an excellent game underneath.\"", "Resident Evil 4 is simply the best video game in the series and the best PlayStation 2 game. It not really scary, but it can become intense when you are trying reload your gun with zombies coming your way in all directions.  This is a must have for zombie fans.", "\"A few years ago, while I was reading my favourite Playstation magazine, I came across an article on Resident Evil 4. Yes!! I am a massive fan ever since I played the original. There were a few pictures and brief insight as it was very early news. I was all worked up and excited! You play as Leon Kennedy! He was great, almost an equal to Chris Redfield! The next month I was devastated. My trusty magazine had just informed me that it was to be Nintendo Game Cube exclusive! Nooooooooooooo....!!!!But then, on the 4th day in November, I collected my copy for the PS2 from the Royal Mail Office (It should have been posted through my letter box but I won't go into that now, read my \"\"10 things that annoy me\"\" review to find out). It seems Capcom didn't forget about its fans after all....Resident Evil 4 gives a very warm return to Leon S Kennedy, the rookie cop from Resident Evil 2. It is six years since the Raccoon city incident and the notorious Umbrella Corporation has been destroyed. Now he is a government agent assigned to rescue the President's daughter, Ashley Graham. Information leads him to a small village somewhere in Europe. Leon arrives escorted by three local policemen.Walking down a narrow path through the trees, Leon advances towards a small cottage. Inside there is a man with his back turned poking at a fire. Upon approaching him, the man picks up an axe and starts walking towards Leon. The latter has no choice but to open fire on the assailant. Leaping out of the window Leon finds that there are more armed attackers waiting.Welcome to Resident Evil....Changes------------------------------------There have been a lot of changes to the latest instalment of the Resident Evil series. All of them are a massive improvement!How annoying was it in the previous games when you knew there was a zombie around the corner, but you didn't know if you were shooting it due to the fixed camera? Admittedly, the fixed camera did help to make the scary atmosphere as you couldn't see what was around the next corner, and it did mean that hi-resolution backdrops could be used. Well, forget pre-rendered backgrounds, this beauty is in Full 3D! That's right; the camera is now close-up behind Leon, so you see what he sees. There is still the tense feel of the old camera as it is easy for enemies to sneak up from behind or the side as the camera is so close.It now means that aiming can be used fully. With each weapon (except the rifles) a red tracer laser shines out of the gun, a tiny circle at the end indicating when a target is locked on. It also makes it possible to have sniper rifles (Yes!).Who can forget those infamous door clips from the resident Evil series? (Every door you went through or most steps had a short intro, in the 1st person, of the character going through) Thought not... Well those of you who thought they were tediously annoying will be pleased to know that it has been scrapped completely! Most doors are opened by Leon in real time, while some have a short loading screen.Leon opens the doors slowly when you click on them, but double click and he will burst through with a good kick! Nice little touch!Another big change is the Inventory. The previous games allowed you to hold between 8 and 10 items (6 for Chris in Resi 1). It was always quite annoying because a key took up the same space as a shotgun!? Boxes were located around the game so that excess items could be stored until needed. Now you get a case with lots of little slots. Each weapon or item requires a different amount of space depending on the size. This means you can carry multiple weapons and herbs etc. Larger cases can be bought later on in the game.It is now essential to find money (ptas), either hidden in crates or from killing enemies. The amount you find varies and will not necessarily be in the same place each time you play. For example you might find 900 ptas in a vase, then die and load back up, and the same vase might hold 800 ptas or ammo. The money is used to purchase weapons or upgrades, which brings me on to the next big change...The item boxes have been scrapped as Leon can now hold much more. In its place is \"\"The Merchant\"\". This guy pops up all over Resident Evil 4, noticeable by the blue torches. There are three options to choose from, Sell, Buy or Tune Up.Sell gives you the opportunity to make money from any treasure you have found. Also if you want another weapon and have no space left, you can sell any item including weapons. The latter can be bought back at a higher price if needed.Buy lets you purchase weapons or rare items, such as treasure maps or larger cases. There is also the option to buy a First-Aid spray; there is only limited amounts so don't go thinking you can replenish whenever he's around.Tune Up allows you to improve almost all your weapons, at a high price of course! There are four parts to improve, Shot Power, Firing Speed, Reload Speed and Capacity. These can be upgraded to a maximum of level 6, although some weapons cannot. There is also the possibility for an \"\"Exclusive\"\" upgrade to some weapons. This comes about much later on and costs heavily. The Exclusive upgrade has a special enhancement on the selected weapon; for example, the Handgun has a x5 chance increase of Critical Headshots, and the Shotgun has the same Shot Power from all distances!The structure of the new Resi Evil is very different from it's predecessors. The old games were one big long level, divided into different places, but with no obvious level start and finish.Now it has taken on a \"\"Devil May Cry\"\" type structure; although it is still one long level in a sense, it is divided by sub sections that are divided themselves, e.g. you could be on level 4 - 3. At the end of each section you are shown your accuracy, number of enemies defeated and number of continues taken. You are also giving the option to save the game.Ink Ribbons have been removed totally. The typewriter is still there, but you can now save to your heart's content! This is a welcome loss, as it was so annoying when you wanted to save but didn't have an Ink Ribbon. And to make things even better there are excessive amounts of typewriters everywhere (OK, maybe not excessive, but still loads)Enemies--------------------------------------The main enemies of Resident Evil 4 (Surprisingly!!) are humans! Well, I say humans, but they seem half human and half zombie?!?They talk (In Spanish I believe...) and they are intelligent to the extent that they dodge where your gun is pointing and sneak up on you. They also run! Which is quite terrifying when you need to reload! Also they climb through windows and open doors. But there is something not quite right with them. Remember the groaning zombie noise of the former games? Well it's back, but this time it's got more depth in the sound! (Don't ask me how but it just has!) And with it comes a quiet chant to themselves, so you can hear them before you see them.If one spots you they will point and shout to their companions of your presence. Keep your senses alert as they can come from anywhere; off roofs, through windows and form the doors behind you.They come with a range of weapons, from knives and spades to crossbows and even chainsaws! Some are protected by a wooden shield (a quick blast from the Shotgun should sort that out!) and there are others with a bullet proof helmet!To deal with the monsters most effectively you have to get a Critical head shot to make their head explode. Blood spurts out from the neck which is quite cool close up! But be careful later on as something can sprout from the neck.........Shooting the men/women in the legs causes them to fall to the floor, very good for when faced with multiple foes.There are sections with new and different foes, but I won't give too much away...!Interactive--------------------------------The Resi Evil world is now more interactive thanks to it being 3D. Crates and vases can be smashed and hold valuable ptas or ammo. Also there are treasures hidden throughout the game that you shoot to make them drop. Some doors and windows can be shot through, breaking them with each shot.There are a lot of puzzles or objects that need to be shot in a certain place in order to progress, e.g. a drawbridge stuck half open, shoot the brackets on the wall to make it fall.Graphics----------------------------------The graphics in resident Evil 4 are exceptional! Everything is so smooth and highly detailed with a great use of colour and lighting. The latter seeps through windows and cracks and looks misty from the dust. Even the caves in the game are packed with detail, the walls really look real! The animation and detail on the Bosses is the best I have seen in any game (Watching the endless body parts shoot out of a man's body will leave you in awe!).The water is again amazing, with great colour and depth to it. The scene on the lake is jaw-dropping; it has fog and bits floating in the water, and it moves with excellent realism! Not to mention the creature that lurks beneath.....!!Sub Missions---------------------------------There are a couple of sub-missions in the main game, most notably the Bottle-Caps. The Merchant runs some shooting ranges in the Castle; select your choice of weapons, either automatic or sniping. The idea is to earn as many points as you can to gain Bottle-Caps. There are 24 to collect and they can be viewed in the treasure menu. Click on them for a close up, and they even have a sound effect! A small, but fun little extra to distract you from the chaos outside...!Weapons---------------------------------There are many new weapons in Resi Evil 4. I won't ruin any surprises by mentioning them all; instead I will give a brief description of a few earlier in the game:KnifeIt wouldn't be Resi Evil without the trusty knife. This time it has a greater use and is easier to use. Hold L1 and the knife is quickly taken out. Use it to smash crates etc to save on ammo.+Advantages - Doesn't require ammo-Disadvantages - Hardly any damage, can only be used at close rangeHandgunSmall but effective, the 9mm handgun will be the weapon most used as there is a lot of ammo and is fairly easy to get that precious head shot. It only takes up 6 slots too.+Advantages - Lots of ammo available, accurate-Disadvantages - Lacks powerShotgunA must carry at all times weapon. Ideal for multiple enemies or when confronted by a stronger foe as it will send them flying backwards. Ammo is sparse so keep an eye on your supply.+Advantages - Very powerful close range, excellent for dealing with multiple enemies-Disadvantages - Not very good at distances, takes up a lot of spaceRifleAn old bolt-action rifle with a scope fitted allowing Leon to zoom in on far away targets. A more powerful scope is avaliable from the Merchant.+Advantages - Extremely accurate, Powerful-Disadvantages - Slow reloadGrenadesThere are three types of grenade; Hand Grenade Large explosion), Flash Grenade (Blinds enemy) and Incendiary Grenade (Bursts into flame). Equip like a normal weapon and throw in the same way.+Advantages - Large damage radius, helpful for blinding Bosses-Disadvantages - Too many can take up a lot of space, can cause damage to yourselfBroken ButterflyA powerful Magnum that comes at a high price. Get this in for those tougher monsters!+Advantages - Extremely powerful, Size of a Handgun-Disadvantages - Limited ammo, Expensive to upgrade, Long reloadRocket LauncherThe ultimate weapon! Use this against the Bosses or any tough situations!+Advantages - Kills virtually everything, large damage radius-Disadvantages - Very expensive, only one rocket a time, Takes up a lot of spaceFlaws------------------------------------The only real flaw to this superb game is that you cannot side step or move while aiming. It means that in order to shoot round a corner you have to run forward and turn, exposing yourself to the enemy. But then it may have been intended to keep the tension high as it is very difficult to see what is round the next corner, and you have to stay rooted to the spot while enemies lunge at you which is quite terrifying! So maybe it's not a flaw after all......Another flaw is that at certain points in the game you find yourself running or dodging various attacks. This is fine in itself, but when running you are told to vigorously bash 'X' then have to press either the buttons or 'X' and square when prompted. It doesn't allow you much time to perform this action so your reactions have to be fast! The trouble is that I found myself constantly dying and it became a trial and error process. And sometimes the buttons change! It's not too bad a flaw, just gets a bit tedious after the 3rd attempt...Summary----------------------------------Resident Evil 4 has a more tense atmosphere than it's predecessors. This is mainly down to the music and sound effects. When an enemy is present, the music kicks in and doesn't stop until they have all been eliminated.The scariest moment for me was the small maze. You can hear the dogs breathing heavily but you have no idea which corner they lurk around! I jumped on more than one occasion when a dog has snuck up on me! Being able to hear the monsters before you can see them gets your heart thumping and every little noise gets your adrenaline going.The enemy eyes are another big 'chill' factor; they are a dead red and close up their stare can be very intimidating! All the more reason to blow their head's off!The infamous puzzles of the previous games have been reduced dramatically which thankfully doesn't slow down the games pace. There are some puzzles, but they are so easy you hardly notice them.Amazingly there is hardly any returning to previous places. Other Resi Evil titles depended on this to extend the playing time, which could result in frustration. RE4 hardly suffers from this problem at all, thanks to the vast size of the levels. The maps are like a narrow tunnel, with barely any branching off, but it goes unnoticed thanks to the superb aiming system that fools you into thinking that you can play it how you like.Capcom have done an excellent job redesigning the whole structure, and have pushed the PS2 to its highest peak!Overall: 97%-------------------------------This game is a virtually flawless, action-packed, enjoyable masterpiece that is quite possibly the greatest game of 2005!This will keep you entertained for a good few weeks, and when played alone in the dark will get your heart pounding and your forehead sweating!The main game takes a good 15-17 hours to complete (Not including dying) and there are also some extras to unlock.Most notably it has five extra Ada Missions that were not in the Game Cube version (Haha), expanding on her background and why she's there. It coincides with Leon's missions and shows just how she helped him out. And it takes about 5 hours to go through so it is a very welcomed addition!There is also another Ada mission, and the good old Mercenaries, which has unlockable characters!And if that wasn't enough, on completion of the game you also get a \"\"Professional mode\"\" for those of you who love a good challenge!A must buy for all fans of the genre (and everybody else actually...) If you enjoyed any of the previous games, you will love this!I know this was a long read, but it is such a good game that I had to put it all in! The game is worth it! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it :D\"", "\"resident evil 4, what a weird game.  i had to try it again after my first disappointment because it's rated so highly.  the second time, i figured this game out.  i was expecting it to act more like a FPS, when in reality it's a survival horror game.  fair enough.  that means instead of crouching, proning, jumping, sprinting... you'll be standing totally still and shooting a bunch of zombies at close range.  it's a different kind of game, and it is quite enjoyable.. until you take the negatives of RE4 into account.  the movement of your character is just so frustrating.  he moves very SLOW.  to turn around, you have to use up on the analog stick + a button.  that's not intuitive or fun.  the instinct is to RUN when a zombie throws a stick of dynamite at you.  but you shouldn't run, because you're too SLOW.  ironic considering our \"\"hero\"\" can run and jump out of second story buildings without a scratch.  again, i don't expect this to be a FPS game.  as a survival horror game, it gets a lot right.  the shooting is done very well, but here's where we get to an even bigger flaw then the frustrating/clumsy controls..  NO AMMO.  huh?  you mean this is a shooting game where you end up using a freaking KNIFE and he can't even move while he's swinging this knife?  you got it!  our \"\"hero\"\" has to get up really close to the evil zombies and swing his knife while standing still.  personally, i just don't find that very fun.  i think the guns are a lot more fun to use.so this is what happened to me - i was playing through this game like a normal gamer would, by using all my handgun and shotgun ammo up.  since you can only find ammo in barrels and boxes, it's very scarce even after you explore all the areas.  that's right folks - YOU CAN'T BUY AMMO.  you can buy guns, first aid.. hell you can even upgrade your gun's firing power and reload speed with money, but you can't BUY AMMO?!?!?!  what kind of a freakin' game is this?!  you can't move with a knife in your hand and you can't buy ammo?  umm, ok.  anyway, this resulted in my INESCAPABLE death because i had to face a strong zombie with a chainsaw.  the only way you can take this dude down is with a shotgun.  i tried shooting him with my meager handgun ammo.. he lived.  so then i had to use the knife.. but that means he quickly sawed my head off with his chainsaw.  game over.  to beat this jerk, i'd have to start the game ALL OVER and start killing zombies with the STUPID KNIFE to get anywhere.  but wait.. how do you know when it's OK to use your handgun or shotgun?  joke's on you, gamer, because - YOU DON'T! HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!  \"\"here, let's give the player a bunch of cool weapons and let him spend his money on them, and then give him so little ammo, he doesn't even know when he can use his guns!  whenever he decides he can use them, he'll run out of ammo and have to use his knife and he'll die!  hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!\"\"  jerks.  this game pisses me off.\"", "\"I haven't been this addicted since Grand Theft Auto III!!Real Horror, excellent effects, a great story line, great graphics, a whole lot to love!I've been playing games on the PS2 for awhile now, and some games are good, some are great and some are truly epic.  Resident Evil 4 falls into the truly epic category.Here's why;  It's everything from the technical aspect of the camera angle, to the weapon selection and upgrades, to the sound effects and downright creepy sounds and environments that you play in.  Too many games mess up the camera angles, to the point where sometimes you actually lose your spot on the screen (which is invariably at that critical time when a bad guy is just about to eat your lunch) not so in Resident Evil 4.  The weapon selection is very varied with many upgrades.  The sound and graphics combined are enough to stand the hairs on the back of your head on end.  Throughout the game when one of the unseen zombies screams you will literally jump out of your chair.The best part of Resident Evil 4 is the replay value, which is SKY High.  In particular \"\"Separate Ways\"\" which puts you in the position of an important supporting cast member as you replay the game through her eyes, its a great twist, which adds a lot to the game.Lastly, with over 20 hours of gameplay, Resident Evil 4 really delivers.  Its a first rate achievement, way to go Capcom!\"", "I am a fan of the franchise, so I may be a little biasPro- game is amazing and smooth- the aiming function is a good addition to game play- game story is good and somewhat follows the overall story from previous games- character voice sound great and portray the character wellCon- noneOverall I have played and beaten the game several times.", "For me, this is the best Resident Evil so far..., the story, the graphics and the gameplay are fantastic, i recommend this game !!!", "Resident Evil 4 is a fanastic game, plain and simple. Everything is done right, from the variety of weapons, to the ridiculous graphics and spooky atmosphere, RE4 provides a truly great experience for any and every PS2 gamer.The only problem with the game is that everytime you fire your weapon Leon stands still. In other words, he can't run and shoot at the same time. So what you have to do is run to a corner, turn around real quick, and start firing at people's heads. The game is just plain scary at certain points and will make you jump out of your seat and put the light on if you're playing at night. (which is the best time to play by the way)Another thing that I love about this game is the diffculty level, which increases nicely from the start of the game to the end. This game also uses interactive cut scenes, which add some variety to an already addicting game. As you progress through the spooky town into the depths of hell, this game grabs you and never lets go.What are you waiting for? Go get this game, you will not be dissapointed.", "This is the best game to the resident evil series i think.reason being is 1-the graphics are amazing.2-the veiw is kinda close to u most the time tho hides whats to ur left and right(but u can move the veiw with the right analog stick).3-the controls are awsome as they have been sence re1.4-its not as easy as before because these monsters aren't retarded,they run and use weopens,plus there not easy to kill.5-still a great story line as always.6-the graphics are so good u cant even tell when ur accualy playing.7-you can upgrade your guns and it accualy helps its sweet.The bad....well i think that theres not realy any bad get this game.another thing to add RE4 won game of the year 05'.awsome game.hours of fun", "Probably the earliest game released that I've played with the over-the-shoulder shooter style. The graphics are unmatched by any other PS2 game and has a very fine storyline.The one small problem that I have is that the aiming is hard to control. You cannot dodge and shoot at the same time or even remotely at the same time. I wish they would have utilized both analog sticks for shooting.", "\"This game is about as intense as action/adventure games get. Although it's survival horror, you'll only be scared by the intensity of the battles and wits of the enemies.The traditional zombies are gone and have been replaced with psycho villagers and weird chanting cult members. The old camera view is gone so now you don't need to worry about running into walls for no good reason and has been replaced with a unique over the shoulder view. You also get assisted with a laser for your gun.  You can shoot people anywhere on the body and that body part will be affected. Such as if you shoot someone in the leg, they will fall to their knees. Or if you shoot them in their face, they'll grab their face.The graphics are top of the line for a system that's about to be last gen. The game cube version is only slightly better with faster load times. However the ps2 version makes up for that with the additional weapons and side missions.Cut scenes in the game are interactive so if you think you'll get to sit back and enjoy the show, you're wrong. You'll need to press certain buttons at the right time to avoid being stabbed, shot, etc.The series has been reinvented and hopefully will only get better; we'll have to wait for RE5 to see.Pros:-As intense as action/adventure games get.-Amazing graphics-unique game play and shooting style.-decent length with added side missions-different story although it's still a \"\"rescue and get out in time\"\" kind of gameCons:-Could have benefited with a one-button-quick-switch-weapon option.\"", "\"I like the new take on Resident Evil Capcom has decided to go with. This is unlike any resident evil I have ever played. Killing \"\"Zombies\"\" is actually a part of the storyline and you even get points for doing it. The upgrades you get from the merchant are nice. And even though there is a lack of the T-virus, I still get a sense of fear and terror from all new villains and monsters.I can't wait to try this on the wii, because the PS2 version is stil pretty fun.\"", "Ok, so my review for the Wii version may have been a tad bit on the squeemish side. I went and purchased this game for my PS2, (as my friend had the Wii) and have LOVED it. I am on section 5-2 and have been enjoying it every step of the way. In fact, I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Halo, Half Life and Medal of Honor Allied Assault.In this game you play the character Leon. He is a cop from racoon city sent to rescue the presidents daughter from a remote European location. This is when the plot takes a twist and he finds himself in a village of Spanish speaking villagers, obviously possesed by some greater evil. He later finds that they are the mutated result of a dangerous virus injected into them by an evil group called the Los Illuminados. Monks with attitude. Their evil plan: to turn Ashley inject Ashley with the virus and send her back to America... Causing serious problems. Basically, throughout the course of the game, you fight villagers with pitchforks, axes, and... yes... even chainsaws. This game will have you cracking up one instant and screaming in terror the next.GRAPHICS 5-5GAMEPLAY 5-5SOUND/MUSIC 5-5GAME LENGTH 5-5REPLAY POTENTIAL 5-5Definately one buy!(For a teen player.)", "Resident Evil 4 - Circa 2005GOOD:- Fast and furious game play- Original Resident Evil story with little to do with pervious Resident Evil gamesBAD:- When compared to other Resident Evil games this one is a little light on story- You have to buy almost all new guns and upgrades (which for some people is a pain)- Graphics slightly better on Game CubeIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- This game is almost nothing like pervious Resident Evil games form the game play being very fast moving, to the story having no zombies or umbrella company- This game while harder combat wise when compared to other Resident Evil game is much easier in terms of puzzlesGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Resident Evil: Zero- Resident Evil (Remake on Game Cube)- Splinter Cell (not for story or stealth, but for shooting aspect that is similar in both games)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Beating the game once will unlock Leon's Resident Evil 2 costume (police uniform) and a 1920's Gangster costume, An arcade style battle mini-game, and a bouns Ada mini-game that is more expanded from the Game Cube version", "After proving to be the greatest Resident Evil game of all time when released last year on the Gamecube, Resident Evil 4 makes it's bloody debut on the PS2, and the good news is that it retains just about every excellent feature that made Resident Evil 4 a game so good that it was worth buying a Gamecube for alone.  The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics aren't as mouth watering as they were on the Gamecube, but RE4 still looks amazing in this PS2 conversion.  You play as Leon Kennedy, six years after the Raccoon City disaster of Resident Evil 2, and you're on a mission to rescue the President's daughter.  You're led to a creepy town where the locals, well, let's just say they're not too happy to see you.  I don't want to say much more about the story so not to ruin it for those who haven't played this, but make no mistake that it's the best storyline you'll ever see in a Resident Evil game.  The enemies are challenging and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, making RE4 the most action packed edition of the series yet.  The controls aren't as responsive as they should be, in fact, they can be downright clunky when they want to be, but for the most part they don't deter how amazing this game really is.  Capcom threw in some extras here as well, including side missions where you can play as the mysterious Ada Wong and alternate costumes and such.  Make no mistake, Resident Evil 4 is the best RE game ever made, and just like it was on the Gamecube, this PS2 conversion is an absolute must own.", "I know a lot of people don't like this game because it no longer has zombies, but I don't really care. I love this game. When I first played it, I was amazed by how much Resident Evil changed. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I absolutely love zombies, but I also feel a series has to evolve in order to hold people's attention.Either way, what I liked about this game was the new inventory system, which lets you organize your items. Also, the addition of many different types of weapons is cool.A lot of people criticize this game for not being as scary as the other ones. Well for me, I was never really as scared of the other ones as I was with this one. But that's just me.This game comes with cool extras. You can rewatch scenes, play the Mercenaries (a minigame in which you have to kill as many enemies in a set time), and even play an extra scenario as another character. As cheap as this game is, it is definitely worth a try.", "\"Resident Evil 4 is the best game of 2005 and the best one out of the entire Resident Evil Franchize. The amazin gameplay, cutscenes, Boss battles, and graphics and physics have made this game so damn fun. Leon Scott Kennedy (from RE2) is back but not in Racoon City But in Europe Possibly Spain on a top secret mission \"\"to save the presidents daughter\"\". The Game from beginning to End is without a soubt amazing and scary. I suggest you get the PS2 version because although it has less appealing graphics, it does have much more extras such as the new mini game-Seperate Ways which explains the more confusing parts of the story. New costumes With Leon wearing a mafia type suit and Ashley wearing an armor which is extremly helpful because the enemies can't hurt her or pick her up and take her away because she's so heavy wearing that armor. Plus new weapons like the Cross Bow-Gun (seperate ways only) which is an explosive cross bow, and P.R.L.412 laser cannon which is a gun that shoots powerful electric/lasers at the enemies. I highly reccomend this game to all types of gamers because it really is that good.P.S.But if you own the first one on the Gamecube version then there is no reason for YOU guys to get this version\"", "Resident Evil 4, to keep the synopsis short and sweet, follows the exploits of Leon S. Kennedy, the rookie cop from the still-brilliant sequel Resident Evil 2, as he touches down in rural Spain, to rescue the President's daughter from an as-yet unknown group of kidnappers.And really, since the game pitches you headlong into some of the best and most rewarding plot-driven action moments I've ever been lucky enough to experience in a video game, there's very little need for me to elaborate. That, and the fact that I hate spoilers! Trust a man who's been a confirmed games player for sixteen years: this is a great *expletive* game.GRAPHICS: So what if the Cube original version of this game has better graphics? I challenge all but the most superficial kind of player (you know, the kind that's happy with endless driving and fighting game sequels) to be anything but delighted when they see what magical Capcom has managed to do with the six-year old techology behind the PS2. The overall visual theme (washed-out colours, smooth animations, excellent lighting) is very reminiscent of that king-of-atmospheric-games, Silent Hill 2, and the character and enemy animations are first-rate. Enemy design, from the lowliest (villagers, crows) to the more impressive boss battles (the first and second bosses are actually jaw-dropping) is worthy of awards, and the whole visual feel of Resi 4 is one of supreme mastery and undeniable creepiness.SOUND: Voice acting's pretty damn great - in a nice change for a Resi game - and the music is excellent. Finally, here's a Capcom survival horror with real aural punch and muscle. The characters seem more real and their situation seem all the more immediate and tense because of the obvious lengths the sound designers have gone to to bring a deeper sense of the game's experience to us.PLAYABILITY: Here's the real jewel in the crown: Resident Evil 4 is one of the most intuitive and playable games I've ever had. The controls are smooth and familiar to any fan of Survival Horror, and introduce some almost Metal Gear Solid-esque elements to the playing field. Dodging, shooting, and moving about are a joy to experience because of the lack of sluggishness that seems to plague even the most highly-regarded of the survival horror genre - remember how frustrating the speed of characters was in the Fatal Frame and earlier  Resi games was? All gone!The learning curve is a little steeper than normal, perhaps, but in a game of this nature, where the storyline is all about being flung into unreasonable situations with a sense of no-way-out, this actually helps things along.LASTIBILITY: This is, as with all survival horror games, not a terribly long trip. Don't misunderstand, it's 15+ hours on the first play through, but because it's such an amazing experience, you want more. Capcom (I love you!) has tried to alleviate this with some all-new PS2 extra bells and whistles, plus an all-new side-quest starring... ...someone :-), so it's not too disappointing when the credits roll for the first time.But trust me, this is a game you'll come back to for both the storyline and the blissful playing experience again and again.OVERALL: A mighty game; if this is where the Survival Horror genre is going then sign me up for life. That all Software Houses would put such a creative effort into their releases! Resident Evil 4 is deserving of all the praise it gets, and we should feel very thankful that Capcom is around to draw that praise out of us.It's not so much scary as it is jumpy, like an action game with some beautifully-directed moments of tension and fear, and it is so, so much fun to play.Recommended for immediate purchase!", "\"What do you get when you take the classic Resident Evil formula -- shambling hordes, red and green herbs, and plenty of firearms at hand -- and then make the enemies smarter and faster, revitalize the gameplay by updating the control scheme, add some of the best graphics ever seen on a home console, and throw in some film-quality voice acting to boot?What you get is Resident Evil 4, the best Resident Evil game in the whole series.RE4 is definitely a new entry in the series, an original in its own right. The gameplay has been improved immmeasurably by an over-the-shoulder perspective that moves with the character constantly, a method which is both dramatically easier to use and immensely intuitive. The voice acting, usually sub-par to average for the previous Resident Evil games, is substantially improved here.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, utilizing complex terrain and environments which seem to live and breathe, and rich character models that almost seem like they could jump right out of the screen. The addition of a simple economy/market system for new weapons and upgrades adds a new dimension never seen in Resident Evil before. The story is a departure from the tropes of the previous games, though it still has its roots in familiar places.And yet, despite these improvements (and they are ALL improvements), there's enough of the classic Resident Evil here to satisfy the diehard fans of the series.  Plenty of nasty beasties to fight with a variety of weaponry, and if you aim well heads will still explode and bodies will still burn.  Green, red, and yellow herbs are still here to heal you, and you'll still find the occasional can of First Aid Spray as well. The main character in this one in Leon Kennedy, last seen as a rookie cop in Raccoon City in Resdient Evil 2, now working for the U.S. government, tougher and stronger and ready for a new challenge.  Other familiar characters will also appear along the way, including a couple of old favorites from the previous games.Resident Evil 4 is a long game, too, taking many hours for the initial run-through, withs lots of replayability once the first time is done. After you finish the first game, new games become available, including \"\"Mercenaries,\"\" a free-for-all shooting match, \"\"Assignment: Ada,\"\" in which you take on the short mission of one of the other characters, and new for the PS2 version of the game, \"\"Separate Ways,\"\" a five-chapter story filling in some of the gaps that the main storyline doesn't completely explain. And once you finish those, you might be ready to try the main game again in Professional mode for a bigger challenge.  Rest assured, many hours of gore-streaked play await you with Resident Evil 4.As much as I love the original Resident Evil games and the way they do what they do, I was glad to see that the makers of this game took some risks and breathed new life into the undead. By making a few changes, they actually made the experience of this game more like playing the original for the first time, and all the delightfully twisted, disgusting, scary fun that entailed.\"", "This part of 'Resident Evil' video game series is indeed a marvelous transition from the RE3 system on PS1 to a whole new and improved system on PS2.You get to play as Leon S. Kennedy once again since RE2 on PS1, save the president's daughter, protect her, and most importantly... try to survive the whole story!This game also contains two additional playable modes that you play as Ada Wong, and a new and improved 'Mercenaries' mode with alot of characters to play with.This game is simply awesome and amazing, I recommend it for all RE players.", "\"THE GOOD: Fantastic presentation; revolutionary action gameplay; unforgettable enemies; top notch audio and visual; lengthy adventure and unlockables make for high replay valueTHE BAD: Not as scary this time around; some questionable and scripted hit detectionDIFFICULTY: Medium-to-HardWell, it's obvious the folks at Capcom were just about as tired as the rest of us when it was clear where the RE frachise was going with mediocre spin-offs that basically offered the same clunky gameplay over and over. They heard your complaints and suggestions, and basically outdid themselves this time.Resident Evil 4 was origionally released for the Gamecube a year before the PS2 version, and its absolutely revolutionary gameplay, incredible graphics, memorable enemies, and constant on-your-toes challenge made this in most publications the 2005 game of the year.The PS2 is a very near identical port of the GC version, and with the new extras thrown in, may make this the better of the two games... in some aspects.The storyline is pretty straightforward, you are Leon Kennedy of RE2 and on a government mission to save the president's daughter in the outskirts of Europe (most likely Spain, since everyone speaks spanish). It stands on its own for the most part, so newcomers who've been living under a rock and never played any of the first 3 RE games will be pretty safe here.Now, the first thing people will love about this one is the new over-the-shoulder camera perspective which gets rid of that annoying static camera and clunky \"\"tank\"\" player control of the original titles. You always have a fresh look on everything and with the new laser sight enemy hit detection system, it makes pulverizing your grunting, dirty, virus-infected human monstrosities all the more fun... so fun in fact that the unlockable \"\"Mercanaries\"\" mode which offers ONLY the pure, balls-out head exploding action that will have you replaying this time and time again (this isn't even mentioning the other 2 Ada missions, one of which is a PS2 exclusive and offers a new 6-7 hour adventure). Besides the action, the puzzle aspect of the game still lies within, though not anywhere near as thorough as the original RE games had it. This is a good thing, no more collection annoying crests to open doors and whatnot. The game controls very much realistic as well, Leon isn't able to strafe or do all out Devil May Cry style death-defying jumps to avoid enemy hits, it's all very accessible and though isn't as tank-like as the early games, it still feels a bit limited which better balances the horror on-your-toes action. The game will also keep you on your toes mainly through the cut-scenes, which don't offer a break like other games, no. In most instances you'll have to quickly hit a series of 2 different button combinations to avoid attack in split-second timing, if you don't, you either get hurt pretty bad, or die. Some are so intense you'll find yourself staring at the tv eyes wide, sweat beading down your forehead, holding your breath, fingers tense and ready - it's VERY exciting.Now, though most aspect of the Gamecube version are great, the aiming system feels a bit touchy mainly because the PS2 controller isn't very good for first-person shooters which require fairly precise aiming. Also, the hit detection, though a great addition - which makes enemies react appropriately to which area of the body they are hit - can sometimes be off and feel scripted rather than real. About a quarter length into the game, you'll find that blasting an enemy's head off will result in his inner \"\"monster\"\" to start waving a very dangerous whip blade at you, which makes the combat even tougher. So generally you'll try and start shooting them elsewhere. Still, the game sometimes forces you to fight these annoying monsters, so even though you'll hit an enemy square in the stomach, his head will magically blow off. This becomes annoying especially when trying to control a huge crowd of foes. One final minor complaint is with the atmosphere in the game. Though the battles and fear of getting killed are scary, the atmosphere that made the first RE games so scary just aren't here anymore. This is partially because the game is very action-oriented, and though the environments look beautiful, they aren't very scary.That's about enough with the negatives.One great positive is how the game forces you to fight. In older games, if you didn't have enough ammo you could simply run past enemies. In this game, the vast majority of enemies will leave behind money, weapons, and health power ups which are necessary for later in the game. The money aspect is a very welcome addition. Generally, in many parts of the game you'll come across a mysterious guy who you can buy and sell from. New and upgradeable weapons, along with the more realistic and strategic inventory system, bring a great RPG element to this game which can also greatly enhance the replay value (should I trade in this shotgun for this other one? Are buying these treasure maps really worth it?) It's enough to warrent another playthrough just to see what other weapons and power-ups you can upgrade and how it'll alter the challenge.Graphics and sound are a grand showcase of their own. Every shot, every kill, every explosion, every scream and moan just oozes inspiration and hard development work. And the graphics, oh man the graphics, are SO gorgeous at times that I found myself simply stopping just to LOOK at it. It's amazing the PS2 was even able to pull this off.There are simply too many positives which make the PS2 version of RE4 worth an instant purchase - fast enemies (no more zombies in this one), split second reactions, incredibly fun hit detection, lengthy adventure, strategic inventory, gorgous graphics, GOOD voice acting, and involved story make this easily the BEST Resident Evil and easily the greatest game of 2005.BOTTOM LINE: If you own a PS2, and don't own this game, you don't deserve your PS2.
