{"reviews": ["This Enfamil formula variation, while good in terms of nutrition, ease of digestion, etc., isn't different enough from other Enfamil variations for infants with sensitive systems to merit the increase in price. The &#34;premature&#34; label adds a premium that the slight difference in nutritional value doesn't reflect.", "We used this when our son was born prematurely. Our doctor recommended this in order to get our baby gain some weight. I was able to help my wife with the baby a few times a day when she wasn't breastfeeding. This gave her time to get some rest. It worked great as far as my son gaining weight. The formula mixes well just like all their other products.", "Our daughter was 6 weeks premature and spent the first 6 months of her life on this formula to help her put on weight (per doctors orders).  It worked great.", "One of the things I like about the powdered formula itself is that it is shelf stable. Similar to things such as powdered milk, the formula will need to be kept in a cool, dry place. The expiration date is approximately ten months from now, something I really like. I used to purchase a ready-to-feed formula, but storage was a problem. Preparation and storage are definitely issues that need to be adhered to. We have thePhilips AVENT Electric Steam Sterilizerand have made good use of it over time.There are Enfamil formulas that you can tailor to your specific child&#8217;s needs.  This formula is specifically designed for the preemie to ensure he or she will have enough nutrients when transitioning to the home setting. Powder is powder and sometimes problematic to fix, but a premium formula like EnfaCare is well worth the effort. What I see different in this formula as opposed to some of the others is the addition of the whey proteins.FEATURES:&#9658;  Enfamil EnfaCare is scientifically designed to support development and growth for premature babies during their first year of life after leaving the hospitals&#9658;  Expert recommended levels of DHA and ARA to support brain and eye development&#9658;  Blend of nutrients and antioxidants to help your baby&#8217;s immune system&#9658; Clinically proven to help premature babies achieve catch-up growth similar to that of full term, breastfed infantsINGREDIENTS:Nonfat Milk, Whey Protein Concentrate, Corn Syrup Solids, Lactose, High Oleic Vegetable Oil (Sunflower And/Or Safflower Oil), Soy Oil, Medium Chain Triglycerides (Mct Oil), Coconut Oil, And Less Than 2%: Mortierella Alpina Oil*, Crypthecodinium Cohnii Oil**, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E Acetate, Vitamin K1, Thiamin Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Vitmain B6 Hydrochloride, Vitamin B12, Niacinamide, Colic Acid, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Choline Chloride, Inositol, Calcium Carbonate, Calcium Phosphate, Magnesium Chloride, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Cupric Sulfate, Potassium Iodide, Sodium Selenite, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Citrate, Potassium Hydroxide, Taurine, L-Carnitine, Nucleotides (Adenosine 5&#8217;-Monophosphate, Cytidine 5&#8217;-Monophosphate, Disodium Guanosine 5&#8217;-Monophosphate, Disodium Uridine 5&#8217;-Monophosphate). *A Source of Arachidonic Acid (Ara). **A Source of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA).", "This is a difficult formula to rate.  My daughter was a month premature and was 5 lbs 14 oz at birth (5 lbs 6 oz when we left the hospital) and was put on EnfaCare for about a month because we had issues getting her to eat and she needed the extra calories.  I didn't have any issues with the formula.  It mixed well and she tolerated ti well, but did it help her catch up to her peers?  Maybe?  I don't have a control group to compare to!  I know the manufacturer says most babies who start on this stay on it for nine months.  My daughter did not.  Her pediatrician didn't feel she needed it once she hit about 8 lbs.  She is now a pre-teen and stays around the 5th percentile for height and weight.  Is this because she never caught up or because she was just destined to be a smaller person?  I believe she was just meant to be a smaller person.I now have another preemie in my care.  We'll see if the end result is different with this one!", "Enfamil EnfaCare Infant (ages 0-12 months) is characterized by milk, whey proteins, more corn syrup, less lactose, DHA, choline, vitamins, and minerals.The sugar in milk is non-sweet lactose (disaccharide), which is not absorbed into the bloodstream already in the mouth, as sweet glucose (monosaccharide), which thus is not a healthy substitute for lactose. Unfortunately, most of milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in EnfaCare and not for a polysaccharide, e.g. maltodextrin.  Corn syrup (solids) contains glucose and - like high fructose corn syrup - may contain fructose, which presence (sweetness) can be masked by adding other sugars. Scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine. So are corn syrup solids with fructose, which content is not provided on the label. Also, high intake of dietary fructose may lead to liver damage from bacteria due to their movement from gut into the blood stream and liver.So, would you like to start your child's obesity and exposure to a potential liver disease (NAFLD) when he/she is an infant, wait for later, or maybe not to accustom the child to corn syrup at all in order to avoid the fructose desire/addiction, as concentrated fructose is not common in nature, humans were not exposed to its consumption, and thus are vulnerable even those who are not obese yet?! A benefit for prematurity does not excuse beginning addition.DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) found in fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be synthesized in humans. A study found that preterm infants fed DHA had better developmental outcomes, but not the full-term infants or term infants (1-12 mo) who develop normally.  A formula for the newborn (0-3 mo) without corn syrup seems to suit better both the preterm and full-term newborns while no evidence suggests that supplementing DHA for the older infants (3-12 mo) is beneficial.Choline is found in sunflower, soy, cod fish, broccoli, cauliflower, milk, chicken, etc. Endurance athletes and people who drink a lot of alcohol may be at risk for choline deficiency and may benefit from choline supplements.Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition has 3 lines of formulas: Enfamil Newborn (ages up to 3 months), Enfamil Infant (up to 12 months), and Enfagrow Toddler Transitions (9 to 18 months) and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step Milk Drinks (1 year & up). Except Enfamil Newborn, Infant A.R. and partially EnfaCare, all milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition formulas including the Infant Soy. Enfamil Newborn is characterized by easy to digest proteins, choline, DHA, and vitamin D. Enfagrow Toddler Transitions is characterized by DHA, choline, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants. Enfagrow Toddler Next Step is characterized by calcium and vitamin D, and is available in two flavors: vanilla and natural milk.", "Good formula for preemie babies, has extra vitamins and everything they need to help them catch up and grow since they are born sooner they need a lot of extra stuff since they are behind where they should be, this formula helps them by adding that extra stuff they need.  While it won't catch them up completely, it sure does help and goes that extra mile and above and beyond most formulas, just for preemies.  Highly recommended!", "I snag this for one my friends and plus to help her out with cost of formula. So it was very fortunate that I was able to provide this to her. This is a good product for premature babies. Her baby girl growth is consistent. She seems to like it and I'm so happy that she is putting on weight. She still has some gas and occasional spit up. So far so good so I would highly recommend this product, especially for a premature baby or a baby who isn't gaining weight well.", "When our granddaughter was born at 12 weeks early, we knew she would be on so-called 'premie' formula for quite a while.  The hospital used the other major brand, but it gave the poor child so much gas, that I suggested this brand (as both of my kids had been raised on it also).  The doctors agreed to the switch and now she is a happy, smiling baby.  Since she started life at just 3.8 pounds, the fact that she is now over 13 (at two months corrected age), I'd say she is doing very well on this formula.", "Medical necessity and doctor recommendation led us to formula feed, so we started with EnfaCare.  There were a few feeding difficulties not related to the formula, which was frustrating.  Once those were resolved, the formula seemed to be well-tolerated.  We ended up using this formula for about 8 weeks before switching to a different Enfamil formula.I liked that it was a powder formula, which we were able to store and transport easily.  I'd recommend this formula if you have a premature infant and the doctor is recommending formula.", "Nothing beats breastmilk, but when your baby is needing extra nutrition/calories to gain weight then I think this is a fairly good product.  I'm not fond of the corn syrup solids - that's definitely not found in breast milk, but it makes the formula sweet and therefore babies will usually drink it down.  Unfortunately they get hooked on sweet at the most early of ages.  Also, this product costs a lot of money but for babies who are born prematurely they usually need some extra help getting strong and growing so I definitely would give this a try.", "I got this because my milk isn't adequate enough and I trust this brand fully.  I have no complaints whatsoever. Perfect.", "Infants born prematurely have special needs.  Luckily, there are formulas such as this one from Enfamil Enfacare that fill the bill.  Highly recommended.", "This is for premature babies to help them gain enough weight to flourish. It has extra calories and is packed with nutrition. It is not recommended for every feeding, just a couple a day in conjunction with breast-feeding. I wouldn't use this for a term baby who is within normal weight limits as it is a lot of extra calories. If your doctor recommends this it is an excellent product.", "I'm soon to be a mother of 3 and my two younger children both enjoyed Enfamil Formulas. Enfamil EnfaCare Infant Formula (with Iron) is a special formula made especially for babies who are born prematurely. The Enfamil EnfaCare Infant Formula is for babies ages 0-12months and later on it can be mixed with cereal and oatmeal like all Enfamil/Enfagrow formulas.Like All Enfamil formulas It has extra DHA and Iron vitamins and helps support better growth, brain & eye development as well as immune system development. So your baby won't be losing out on any of the great essential vitamins and minerals needed for healthy development.I used Enfamil EnfaCare Infant as a great started for my daughter who was born 2 months premature. before later switching to Enfamil Premium. It helped her get her weight up and she's now a healthy happy little girl. Would definitely recommend to other parents. recommend this formula to anyone with a special little baby.", "We were extrea carful with what the baby ate and the infamil came recommended from the nurse and many of our friends. The powder was easy to mix and didn't smell bad.  The baby seemed ot enjoy it."], "A": [0.016837652772665024, 0.04373447224497795, 0.07101856917142868, 0.009608402848243713, 0.01803756132721901, 0.06713584810495377, 0.08577893674373627, 0.07711201906204224, 0.03849472850561142, 0.01821502298116684, 0.096905417740345, 0.12634913623332977, 0.09415069967508316, 0.04896632581949234, 0.06738531589508057, 0.12026982754468918]}
