{"reviews": ["\"I am a devotee to this serum, it does wonders for my skin. I've always been complimented on my skin, but the lack of sleep and long work days haven't done it any good. This serum is a truly regenerating serum. I put it on every morning before any makeup and the results are visible. When I stop using it my skin becomes less smooth and does not glow.I also tried the Olay ProX range but it is a little too much for me right now being in my 30s. This fragrance free serum is just the perfect thing. I have combination skin and it works well for me. Sometimes I don't get it as it is pretty pricey but I can tell the difference in my skin when I am using this serum so I caved in and signed up for a subscription on Amazon. The one with the SPF factor is not as good as this one, nor the one with \"\"Touch of Sun\"\" tanning. This is THE best, and gentlest anti-aging product I've found till date.The greatest compliment I can give is that if I had to choose one face moisturizer for the rest of my life it would be the regenerist.\"", "I've used this regenerating serum for more than six months and have found it to be as described--easy to apply, absorbs quickly, no scent, and overall a winning formula for a moisturizer.  Another plus is the price which is much more reasonable than the same type of item in department stores and it does the same, if not better,job.", "I have tried so many products to just be totally disappointed. But this one does work. The lines under my eys are my problem area and this has helped to make them much less noticeable..Manufactures take note-- I am tired of the false claims and when I find something that actually works I will buy it. Most I have tried before do not work and should not be advertised as such.", "I love Oil of Olay. My primary moisturizer is Oil of Olay Total Effects 7 in One and I love LOVE the creamy fine odor-free texture of the Total Effects but this one is just a weird feeling on your face. I also did not notice any results from using it. I think I even tossed the rest and I've never done that with a cream. Pretty sad it didn't turn out good as I do love the line of Oil of Olay.", "Having found some Olay products that I thought were excellent I gave this one a whirl.  After 6 weeks of use I don't notice a decrease in lines.  My skin is extremely dry, flaky with uneven skin tones and I have noticed improvement in these areas.  Is it from this product or one of the others it is impossible to tell.  I do like that it is fragrance free.", "\"The Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum is sort of a mixed-use cream. On one hand, it's not the super-expensive use-by-the-drop eye cream that is typically sold in the tiniest bottle on the planet. On the other hand, it's not a more casual face cream that you would slather on your entire face, at least not at the prices they ask for it. This falls somewhere in the middle. It's not meant for near-eye use - Olay has a Regenerist eye lifting serum for that task. Rather, this regenerating serum is meant to be used at other wrinkle spots that don't require the super-special eye cream. Eye skin tissue is VERY delicate - where the wrinkles on your forehead and mouth are not quite so delicate.I use the fragrance free variety, because I don't want anything that near to my nose to be putting off aromas all day long. It is indeed fragrance free, which is nice. I use the serum on my forehead, and under my chin. Those are where, for me, I need the most help keeping my skin in its best shape.The price is of course a down side, but again it's meant for special care; it's not meant to be a full body lotion. You use this where your skin is in need of some TLC and attention. However, having said that, I find that it's just a little too greasy for me. Where the eye serum is wonderfully light and goes great with the delicate eye skin, this serum should have been slightly more thick but with the same grease-free feeling. Instead, I find the greasiness to be uncomfortable on my face. It makes me feel like I need to go wash my face to get the \"\"slime\"\" off. I therefore only use this at night, when I fall asleep soon afterwards and let the serum nourish my skin until I wake up again.Well recommended, although I'll keep testing lotions in this price range to see if I find something else of similar quality but with a less greasy feel to it.\"", "I purchased this because it was fragrance free - I hate having my face smelling after using a product.  It goes on easily and the pump dispenses at the right amount - not too much or too little.  It fades in nicely and I can put makeup on fairly soon afterwards.  My face doesn't feel stiff as it does when I don't use product after shower.  So in all, I'm pleased with this purchase.", "The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is how smoothly my foundation went on after using it.  (I used to feel as if my moisturizer and face makeup were too much for my 48 year old face.)  I'm looking forward to the possible fading of age spots in the future with continued use.The price is better than Wal-Mart's if you subscribe and it really is a convenience.  If you run low before you're due for a shipment you can adjust the delivery.  I also subscribed to the eye cream and night cream.", "I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well.", "\"I've been using this serum for at least 6 years.  I love the fact that Olay eventually came out with this fragrance-free version, that in itself is a huge selling point for me.  And it works!  Most people think I'm at least 15 years younger than I really am.  I have a few very fine wrinkles only when I squint, and that's it.I am a normal-to-dry skin type in the winter and normal during the other seasons.  This serum really helps keep my skin hydrated with the harsh winter winds, and in the summer sometimes this is all I need as a moisturizer if I'm not going to be outdoors - otherwise I also apply a high SPF product if I plan on being outside.Yes, the silicones in this help with the dryness and they also help to blur the fine lines.  I also use a dab of this on my crows feet.  But you may need to watch out if you have a problem with milia.  I occasionally get a few, but I do with just about every other product I have tried so it doesn't matter what I use.  I like the results with this; I've tried other brands without the \"\"cones\"\" and they just don't work for me.This serum contains many ingredients that are beneficial to your skin such as peptides, niacinamide, several vitamins and green tea, which are often found in much higher priced beauty products.Pros:  Hydrating; almost instant blurring of wrinkles due to the silicones; great ingredients; no discernable fragrance.Cons:  The silicones can cause milia occasionally; Olay tests on animals and this bothers me & I wish they would find another way to test their products before putting them on the market -- other companies do, why can't Olay?I recommend this for anyone with normal or normal-to-dry skin.  If you have a problem with acne, probably not, but maybe if you are brave enough, you could do a test first.\""], "A": [0.07567715644836426, 0.1193862333893776, 0.12439776211977005, 0.10804913192987442, 0.12210853397846222, 0.061623018234968185, 0.12322723865509033, 0.120762400329113, 0.08559288084506989, 0.059175655245780945]}
