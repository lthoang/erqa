{"reviews": ["First of all I'm going to talk about the better of the 2, Japan's FFVI (aka USA's FFIII).  Aside from USA's FFII, this is the best Final Fantasy ever!  This game was first released in the USA for the SNES console.  Even then the music in this game was comparable to that of games played on the PSX, the 32-bit Sony system.  The graphics are also great, 3-dimensional.  Besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile.  It's a long one!  There's so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that it's almost unbelievable.  It's a wonder why I didn't choose this one to be #1 instead of FFII.  I guess it's because in my mind FFII is the one that started the greatness of the FF series.  Since FFII, the FF series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good.  Not to bag on FFI, but the story was rather weak and besides, it was on the 8-bit Nintendo system.  If you have been let down by any Final Fantasy you've ever played, this is the one to play.  There's so many different characters you can get in this game as well, but you have to know how to get them.  My favorite is the Ninja, because he has a mind of his own, and you never know what he's going to say or do.My second topic is Japan's FFV.  The only reason I gave FF Anthology 4 stars is due to the greatness of FFVI.  This FFV game though... in a word... sucks.  It's the worst FF game I have ever played.  The enemies are too difficult.  They give you too many character jobs.  And finally, the game is just boring.  The graphics aren't any better than USA's FFII if not worse.  To me this game is like FF Tactics crossed with FFII.  I don't own this game anymore due to the fact that I already have FFIII for the SNES console.  If you don't have an SNES or can't get your hands on FFIII, then this game is a definite must just to play FFVI.", "Square is, at this point, trying to milk the Final Fantasy name as much as they possibly can by re-releasing their games (although FFV makes its American debut in this bundle).Since I personally never thought FFIII (VI in Japan) was a good game, I'm going to stay away from talking about it and receiving the huge amounts of flame that will inevitably follow.FFV boasts the following:  dated graphics, uninvolved plot, a dubious battle system, a cool job system (later featured in FF Tactics, to an extent), some ridiculous situations, and an anime series based on it.More than anything else, however, what gets to me is the ridiculous amount of load time for both games.  These games have 16 bit graphics, no polygons, and low-end sprites, so how can Square possibly explain the ridiculous amount of load time at each interval of the game?  It's quite frustrating when you realize that playing the games on SNES would cut the load times by 3/4.Even so...FFV is part of the final fantasy series, and deserves a playing by the hardcore fans.  Newer gamers, who've never even heard of SNES, will find the addition of FFVI a nice touch.", "As a veteran of the 16-bit SNES days, I can recall countless hours spent playing Final Fantasy III and thinking that it was the best game ever to grace the SNES platform. Well, six years later, my opinion has not changed. Final Fantasy VI has been re-released, keeping intact the entire game as it was back then, with Final Fantasy V as a special bonus.People introduced to the FF series at part VII might not be able to get past the graphics, which were fine for them time but lousy by today's standards. But for the less cynical player, this is the holy grail of RPGs. This is proof that less is more, and the music in these games rivals anything that came later in the series. Having said that, the later installments in the series are great, but it is important not to forget where it all started.Final Fantasy V is a great game, it's big disadvantage being that it is packaged alongside part VI, so gamers will inevitably compare it to FFVI. It is a typical FF game, meaning that you are assured a great game at the least. The &quot;job skills&quot; add a nice twist, and the story, albeit linear, can hold it's own with the best of the RPGs.Final Fantasy VI, as you have read in countless reviews, is probably the most engaging and emotionally involved game in the series. The characters all have likeable personalities, and their individual stories are very enrossing. As the game progresses, the player becomes more involved in their lives. The story is the game's strongest point, while the music is a milestone for any video game. Anybody who dismisses it as &quot;just a game&quot; should takea closer look. Completing this game will become your life.The really good Squaresoft games have an anoying habit of falling out of print quickly, making this game in particular hard to find, let alone at a reasonable price. Anyone who still shops around for SNES games knows this, as well do the people who have tried to find the FF Anthology at their game shop, only to be met with &quot;Sorry, it's no longer available&quot;. This is really sad because there are many people who will not get to experience these games, and will go on thinking that the FF series never got better than  part VII or IX. All I can say is that is you are lucky enough to find a copy, grab it, or else order it online. It is a gem that you will be proud to own.", "You know everyone seems to be getting into the rehashing and rereleasing of old games on new systems.  Asteriods, Centipede, even Frogger have been updated.  Well here are two games that haven't.  They are the same as when they were released on the Super Nintendo or Super Famicom.  Although they have been added to.  Beautiful CG animations have been added to the beginning of both games.  The only beef I have is that the characters in the CG look really, really pale.  I mean ghostly pale.  The music CD that they added was also very poorly planned.  They slapped on music from FF5 and the beginning of the second disk of FF6's soundtrack.  Why didn't they take the themes of the characters?  Those were the good songs from FF6 not &quot;The Magic House&quot; or &quot;Dark World.&quot;  Now to do the games themselves.  FF5: A solid game.  Those players that played FF Tactics will find that there is a job system in this game as well (jobs originated in FF3 for those who care).  After you find one of the four crystals you have the ability to have more jobs come availible to you.  There are 21 different jobs to have from Ninja to Hunter to the trusty Red Mage.  Some of the jobs are really good, others are really bad.  They aren't very well balanced unfortunetly.  As you fight battles you can Points, kinda like Job Points in Tactics.  After you get enough you can a level in that job and get another ability related to that job.  The music hasn't been updated at all.  It is the original Super Nintendo MIDI sounds.  I hate MIDI sounds.  Especially when it sounds MIDI.  The graphics are old school( they will remind you of the block backgrounds in the old RPGs.  Gameplay is very good.  The bosses are very challenging (although there are some that are pushovers).  There are three worlds to explore as well.  It's a fun game and will bring back a lot of nostalgia to those you remember Super Nintendo.  FF6:  The best of the Final Fantasies.  Anyone who says any differently is a fool (I'm sorry if this offends anyone.)  The music is absolutely beautiful.  It may of come from a 16-bit system but it still is the best I've heard.  In Final Fantasy 6 you must face the evil Empire who is bent on using magic to take over the world.  It's your typical RPG from the Super Nintendo era.  There are 12 characters plus two bonus characters that have their own unique abilities.  It's kinda like the job system only without a lot of freedom in who learns what.  Examples the thief Locke can steal, the Magic Soldier Celes can absorb magic and add the MP cost to her own MP.  There are many branches and many plot twists.  There also battles where you actually act out a military campaign.  These are really hard though.  Magic is learned through beings called Espers (the beginning of materia and GFs) and this could be cool but too many Espers have the same spells and too many only give you one and they are the only one that give you it.  Example Crusader with Merton.  Gameplay is standard Final Fantasy.  No surprises there.  All in all.  Final Fantasy Anthology is a must have game for all SquareSoft fans.  If you want to get on the RPG scene I also recommend this game.  It isn't as hungup on graphics and all these special fetures like the newer games are.  It is story and gameplay.  The two most important things in an RPG.  These are the games that will get you started on RPGs.", "\"Now this is gonna sound complicated: all Final Fantasy games were released in Japan first(and still are) then they come here.  Well back when we had NES/SNES,  they released Final Fantasy 1, Final Fantasy IV, and Final Fantasy VI and renamed them to 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  So once Final Fantasy VII(probably the best RPG ever created and I don't throw that around lightly) came out in 1997, people went \"\"whoa, 7? what about 4 to 6?\"\" Enter Anthology, Chronicles and Origins and the recently announced Final Fantasy III remake for the DS. This review deals with Final Fantasy Anthology, containing V and VIFinal Fantasy VStory: Bartz, Reina, Garaf and Faris have to take down X-Death(dumbest FF villain name ever) from controlling 4 crystals. Maybe it's my status as a post VI-player but it must've been irritating saving those damn crystals over and over.Graphics: They're pretty standard really, I mean this is the Super Nintendo so they're not great, even for SNES standards. The FMV's of course are cool.Music: Pretty good but not spectacular like IV or VI.Gameplay: It excels for one reason: The Job System. For the first time, you can customize your characters rather than just being one particular class. Master one job, move to another. The story is eh, music's ok, but play it cause it's a FF.Final Fantasy VIStory: They're existed once powerful beings called Espers many centuries ago. Now they're gone and the world is in an Industrial Revolution-like setting with airships and weaponry. A soldier of the Empire, Terra, was used for battle and after being free of mind control, joins a group of resistance members planning to take down the Empire.Graphics: For the most part the graphics are great for the SNES era. They're still not as sharp/detailed as Chrono Trigger or even colorful like Yoshi's Island but they work in the end.Sound/Music: The music here is usually cited as the best Uematsu soundtrack he's done. While personally I go with VII, VI is by no means a flawed soundtrack. There's tons of great themes: catchy ones, emotional ones and epic ones like Terra's Theme, Forever Rachel, Aria de Mezzo Caraterre and Dancing Mad.A HUGE cast list with 14 playable characters, still the largest cast in a Final Fantasy game. While it's nice to have variety, some don't get as much story as they should've. Ones like Celes, Terra, Locke and Setzer have substanstial backstory while others might just join your party and that's it. The game brings in the Esper System. It's not a wild departure like Junctioning but essentially you can equip an Esper to use in battle and after each battle you get points to learn a spell. Learn it and on to the next one. Finish them all and you can pick someone else.While V is merely playable for the Job system and the fact it's a FF game, VI is required playing for an RPG fan.\"", "You can't go wrong here.  Final Fantasy 6 (released as 3 on the SNES in the US) is hands down the best in the series.  Play through the story of Terra, now with FMV cutscenes.  This is worth playing even if you played the original, just for the FMV sequences.  Then you get Final Fantasy V, long hailed as the best game the US market missed out on.  This is truly a great re-release.", "This was an ok game (or should i say, games), but I didn't find it nearly as addictive as the other final fantasies i've played.  FFV was an ok addition to the series but the dialogue is awkward (They didn't do a fantastic job translating on V or VI) and the gameplay is more like a standard RPG than the final fantasy style.  Buy it if you're really into the FF series, but if you're just starting out, get FFVII first.", "FF5 REVIEWFF5 never made it to the US when it was released in Japan. But now we can finally experience it on the PS1. It's a great entry that is pretty underrated.GAMEPLAY: The highlight of FF5 is its job system. You can be a Knight, Monk, Thief, Dragoon, Ninja, Samurai, Berserker, Hunter, Sorceror, White Mage, Black Mage, Time Mage, Summoner, Blue Mage, Red Mage, Trainer, Chemist, Geomancer, Bard, Dancer, Mime, or you can just be Bare, each with a unique ability and weapon/armor choices. You can switch jobs anytime, and you can share abilities when you learn them. For instance, you can be a Black Mage with White Mage powers, and vice versa. It's kind of hard to explain, but you'll understand it. Whew, that was a  mouthful.This is also the first FF to feature ATB, the bar that tells you when it's a character's turn to attack.The game has tons of unique sidequests and methods of transportation. This is the first FF to feature a submarine, and soon you will get an airship that can be used as a boat and a sub. Cool.GRAPHICS: Very good for the time. Not as good as FF6's, but still decent.MUSIC: Not as strong as others, but this game still has some memorable tunes, like Gilgemesh's theme.STORY: Not the best FF story, but it has a great plot filled with twists.ADDED EXTRAS'S: Just FMV's at the beggining and end of the game. Not very good, because they get the character's hair color wrong. (Bartz's and Galuf's is white instead of brown, and Reina and Faris's is blonde instead of purple.)OVERALL: Don't listen to the haters. This is a very unique game.FFVI REVIEWFF6 was released in America as FF3 for the SNES. This and FF7 are arguably the best entries.GAMEPLAY: This game is the first FF to have a long range of characters and hidden characters, and it is the first FF to allow you to switch them. Each character has a unique ability and you learn magic through summoned Espers.About halfway through the game, the gameplay becomes sidequest-filled and non-linear. Once you get the airship back, you can go to the main villians lair, but if you do and don't bother with the secrets and sidequests, he will defeat you quite easily.Also, who can forget the infamous opera scene?GRAPHICS: Very excellent.MUSIC: Another high point. From the boss music to Kefka's theme, it all rocks.STORY: A very great story with lots of twists. Kind of reminds me of Star Wars in some places.ADDED EXTRAS: Just another FMV scene and they didn't get Terra's hair color right. (It's green, not blonde!)OVERALL: An RPG masterpiece, no questions asked.OVERALL FOR PACKAGE: You can probably find it for $15. And it's a steal for 2 epic RPG's.", "Final Fantasy 6 is arguably the greatest FF game and RPG ever made, and FF5 is another one of the greatest RPGs I have ever played, so how come this game didn't get 5 stars? Well, the load times would be a great place to start. Just like in FF Chronicles, one of the games has great load times, and the other is plagued horribly. FF6 has the worst load times I have ever experienced, even worse than all other ps1 games which have BETTER graphics and contain just as much if not MORE information ( remember Wild Arms? That game was huge, AND it had better graphics than FF6, but it's load times were very, very short, almost unnoticcable, so what the heck!?). Every time you enter a battle you are greeted with 5 + seconds of looking at a black screen, sound fun to you? I didnt think so. Every time you enter the menu you are greeted with another 5+ seconds of load time. Sure, it's only 5 seconds, but once you experience it, you will feel how long five seconds CAN feel, especially when you are used to fast-paced games (the load times are much slower than the PS1 ff's)But on to the games themselves...Final Fantasy 6- Music- 5/5, Fun 0/5, Story 5/5 Gameplay 0/5, overall-1/5 This game is a masterpiece, the greatest RPG ever released on any system. However, given the poor load times, the fun value of this game is whiped out. Seriously, it's a chore to play it. If you have a SNES system i'd dish out 30 bucks for it if you can find it on Amazon or somewhere else. The SNES version has blazing fast load times, the graphics are better, and the whole experience is so much better. I think it is a terrible idea to release a masterpiece with flaws that whipe out any fun while playing the game. Basically, when you buy this you might as well save your time and throw the FF6 disk away, or sell it towards a SNES FF3 cartridge.Final Fantasy 5- Music 5/5 Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Fun 4/5 Overall 5/5 Now this is why this game is worth the price. FF5 is without a doubt a masterpiece, and the version on FF Anthology is great. The load times are pretty fast, the sound is great, and it has the Job system very much like ff Tactics. The job system is a phenomenal idea, and FF5 executes it perfectly. Some hate this game, but I think 5 is easily just as good as 9. It isn't as good as 4, 6, 7, or 8, or heck even Tactics, but you have to realize that FF games are so good that even excellent isnt good enough, and this one is a masterpiece, like most the others. FF5 is much more difficult than any other FF game, even much harder than 4, and you will have to battle quite often for long periods of time, and sometime this can be discouraging if you aren't into battling for a while, but other than that it is a good game. It starts off pretty slow, but as you progress it gets much better, so dont lose interest right away, just wait it out and see if it gets better for you. (When i first got ff Anthology i didnt care a whole lot about 5, but when i got around to progressing through it I found it was a great game)Overall, This version of FF6 might as well not even have been issued, but it is definitely worth it for FF5, and 15-20 bucks is extremely cheap for these two games, just don't expect FF6 to be as fast as the FF3 you remember playing as a kid for Super Nintendo. (Still, I dont get it. Why does FF4 in Chronicles have blazing fast load times, but FF6 is plagued...).So anyway, I highly recommend buying this game, mainly for ff5.", "No, I haven't played Final Fantasy Anthology, BUT I have played Final Fantasy 6 on the SNES and beaten it. The SNES version and PS version are essentially the same. THIS REVIEW ONLY DEALS WITH FINAL FANTASY 6. I have played some of Final Fantasy 5 on an emulator, but not enough to do a review. I have played, to some degree, Final Fantasies 1 - 9. Of all these Final Fantasy games, I would have to say that FINAL FANTASY 6 IS THE BEST TURN-BASED RPG EVER! Some people say that the music is not all that great. I disagree. Yes, it is sometimes repetitive, BUT IT SETS THE MOOD, unlike lots of games out there. ESPECIALLY the first two tunes when you start the final battle, which is really divided into 4 or 5 parts. Every time I hear those tunes I KNOW that I'm at the ending boss. The character development is OUTSTANDING. Most novels would be hard-pressed to come up with such an interesting group. Locke, Setzer, Cyan, Terra, Shadow, Celes, Edgar, Sabin, Umaro, Relm, Strago, Gogo, and Mog. If you've played the game, you just need to LOOK at these names and you INSTANTLY know who they are. The storyline is AMAZING. Magic has been outlawed, but there are some who would like to bring it back and replace technology with it. There are some parallels to Star Wars and the Wheel of Time in here. Eventually you join a rebellion against the evil Kefka. But two of the best parts in the game are: 1--when you get to the opera house for the first time. 2--when the ENTIRE face of the earth is changed and you must start from SCRATCH. I LOVE that part. It is so NONLINEAR. You have to find all your buddies ALL OVER AGAIN, but you can do it in almost any order you want. Sure, the graphics are outdated on this, but GRAPHICS don't make a game, THE STORYLINE DOES. And there is no denying that the storyline in this game is TOP-NOTCH. Final Fantasy 7 and 9 come VERY close, but no cigar. Nobuo Uematsu really put his whole heart into this game, turning out some of the best video game music ever written. If I had the money, I would buy MULTIPLE copies of this game, since I knew that I'd be returning to it again and again . . . .", "Great game, the graphics are good, the music too, and the gameplay is awesome, i recommend to everybody, buy this game !!!", "5 stars for FFVI:  The port came over nicely.  Graphics were preserved, and some additional FMV's were added (always a nice touch).  They messed with the sound a bit, though.  I noticed a slight change in item drops from random encounters as well (some items aren't as easy to get).  Other than that, it's not bad.  Highly recommended if you can't get your hands on the original.FFV was a waste of my time, however.  I couldn't get into the story or any of the characters.  It comes with VI, so give it a shot anyway.  You might like it.", "Final Fantasy Anthology features the Playstation debut of Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI.  FFVI first appeared on the SNES, but was known as Final Fantasy III at the time (it was the third Final Fantasy to make it to America, but the sixth overall in Japan).  Final Fantasy V was only released in Japan and Anthology makes the American debut of the game.  I&#65533;ve been a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, so I was extremely happy that I was now able to play these games on the Playstation.  It was nice to have all of my Final Fantasy on the same system.  There have been complaints about the loading time between battles and menu screens, and while the loading times are not great (or even good), they did not distract me at all while playing the games.  These were just minor complaints for me.Final Fantasy V:As I stated above, this is the first time that Final Fantasy V was playable in the United States.  Graphically, the game is similar to Final Fantasy IV (the one with Cecil and Golbez), but there is a significant difference.  The difference is that there is a job based leveling system now.  This predates Final Fantasy Tactics, but it is similar (less refined, perhaps).  As you progress through the game, your abilities in battle depend on what job class you have chosen to be, and mastering multiple job classes is key to beating the game.  The story is somewhat of a let down after Final Fantasy IV.  I feel this is one of the weaker games in the series, but it is still fun.Final Fantasy VI:This is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time.  While I have loved most of the games, and enjoyed the rest, this one stands first in my heart for the Final Fantasy series.  This game has good graphics for the SNES era, and a long, involved story dealing with magical creatures called Espers and the greed of some humans to steal that magical power.  The story does not center directly on any one character, but a case could be made for Terra, Celes, Locke, and perhaps Edgar as the fourth lead.  The absence of a true lead character adds to the development of the story since it doesn&#65533;t follow one character but follows a plotline where character move in and out of the story arc.  I found this game to be incredibly fun to play and was by far my favorite of the series.", "These games were the first remakes Square released... and the most memorable remakes for many fans of the series too.  This remake brought Final Fantasy V to our shores after all and many fans loved the fact that Final Fantasy VI's remake was faithful to the original AND it got rid of most of the censorship too!  (Younger gamers like me though only got to experience what it was like to play Final Fantasy VI for the first time though.)  Both games are faithful to the originals too... which many fans of the series will like too.  I'd definitely recommend it.", "Both these games are pretty good.Reviewers may judge ff5 for being bad or something, but it is because it is harder than other final fantasys. I think this is a great thing as you can't just use attack every round. The job and ability system is awesome. You can learn abilitys on jobs and use them for other jobs. You could have a sorcerer have the power to store one of his attacks. You could have a knight cast demi. You can have a barbarian who guards other members. It is really cool and fun as you stay with basically 4 characters. These 4 characters can change jobs and look different for each one. The fun thing is getting to choose who does what. The story is great, as it should be. The characters interact and have personalitys.Now, I stopped playing ff5 half way through because it is much longer than other final fantasys. It also has a saving issue. Sometimes when opening the save menu you will see the pixels go crazy. You have to exit the save menu a couple times or just select save by pressing down once than x 3 times. This bug is kinda annoying at times but it can be fixed. It does have high points though that should not be overlooked.FF6 is good. It has much better sprites. It is different though. You can't just have your 4 favorite characters as you will probably switch it up alot. I liked the characters, but they do tend to become useless. Most of them do. I never use Cyan or whatever. The challenge is moderately hard. It is not as challenging as FF5, but more challenging than ff7. There are a ton of summons. I read Expert Gamer sometimes and they have a whole page filled with summons in one issue. The battles are relatively fun, but can be won easily with Edgar. It is so easy to use tools that it is almost a joke. I stopped playing this one half way through also as I got distracted.If you like classic 2d games, these are pretty good. I am gonna finish ff5 after starting over and plan to do the same with 6. They are both good and the editor said &quot;ff5 should of stayed unreleased&quot;. When you say something like that, you clearly did not play the game. It is innovative and fun. Great value for 2 great games!", "I wish there was more re-releasing old, classic games for new systems. I suppose some might see it as the companies just trying to squeeze more money from old games, but I love being able to play these games on new systems, and the addition of new features is always fun to experience.As far as collections go, this is a very good one. Final Fantasy 6, originally 3, is a classic game, and considered by some to be the best FF ever. I can't say I think it's the best, but it is definitely an exceptional game that was even more remarkable when it was first released. It does already seem dated in many ways. At the same time, this is the final game in the series where you can experience the classic, 2D FF that many fans of the series have grown up with.This game does have an excellent cast of characters, and one of the better storylines in the series. The espers, the first real summon monsters, are really cool, and theres somewhere around 30 of them, much more than any other game, which I like. Each character has unique abilities and weapons, which makes for great variety. A very fun old school RPG.The graphics were amazing at the time, but already seem pretty dated. The sound as well. The music that was written for the game is some of Uematso's best, but the sound capabilities of the SNES are just too dated. If they improved anything, I wish they would have improved sound quality a bit. Also, the CG scenes they added were disappointing to me. They weren't that badly done, but I thought that they would be peppered throughout the game at the appropriate spots, which they weren't. They were only at the beginning and end, which I find disappointing. I guess they wanted the actual experience of playing the game to be identical to how it was on the SNES. I wouldn't have minded some small improvements, personally. Overall, they did a good job.FF 5 was a real surprise, and it was great to play a brand new old style FF, never before released in the US. Lots of the reviews on Amazon say that it is really a sub-par game. I have to say I strongly disagree...I think its a great FF game. If you enjoyed FF 4 and 6, I think you'll definitely like 5. The graphics and sound are similar to FF 4. The gameplay is what makes the game so good though. You can switch your characters between the variety of job classes like in FF Tactics or FF X-2, and learn a large variety of different skills, then mix and match them. It's a very primitive form of the job class system, sure, but it's still really cool, considering the age of the game. I also really enjoyed the story of the game...it was about as good as FF 4. Theres a part where you're navigating through a graveyard of pirate ships infested with ghosts and zombies that is totally classic. I would definitely recommend giving FF 5 a chance. It is old and outdated, but definitely lives up to the quality of the FF series.Now, a quick word about the music disc...it's pathetic. An absolute waste of time. If anyone could actually listen to that disc and get into the music on it, I'd say you have serious issues. It's tinny SNES sound, taken directly from the games. I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw some real orchestrated versions (they are available in Japan) of the songs on here...that would have been great. Furthermore, they chose a bunch of the worst songs to include on the disc and left out many of the best. Terrible.But, you won't be buying this collection for the music disc. The games are what matters, and they are quality, faithful ports of the originals. Highly recommended for people who want to walk down memory lane with some great old games.", "I don't like either of these as much as the newer Final Fantasy games (7 and 8), but they are still great games, if you missed Final Fantasy 3(6)  back on the SNES, you should pick it up now, plus you get Final Fantasy 5,  which was never released in the US before now.", "When Final Fantasy VI first came out in the US, I was excited as excited can be.  It was an incredible game, by anyone's standards.  But it cost 70 dollars.  Here, we have the opportunity to buy this as well as the never-released before in the US Final Fantasy V, along with bonus features, for 40 dollars!The games certainly lack the graphical polish of the games of today.  But that is irrelevant - they offer great gameplay, great music, and most importantly, great stories.  It is rather obvious that FF 6 is the more sophisticated of the two games, but FF 5 has its own charms.  In particular, anyone who has played Final Fantasy Tactics will recognize the job system.FF 6 represented a new path for Square in the RPG department.  There was a focus on more mature themes and, unlike most other RPGs, there was no main character.  Their stories interwove wonderfully and seeing how the characters related to each other was one of the highlights of the game.  The gameplay is solid - each character offers their own distinct traits for use during combat, unlike the later FFs (i.e., 7 and 8) and there is an incredible amount of stuff to do in this game.  The music is also considered by many to be the best of the FF series.FF 5 was also a great game.  While it lacked the in-depth characters and the complexity of the next FF, it does excel in all those areas nevertheless.  Plus this game has Gilgamesh.  It's worth playing just to see Gilgamesh.The bonus materials included on the discs are also excellent.  There wasn't much for FF5, except for the introductory CG sequence (and maybe the ending, I'm not sure).  As for FF6, they added a section where you can see dozens of pieces of artwork for the remake of the game, as well as convenient tables of skills and monsters in the game.The additional music CD isn't great, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the set at all.  If you're one of those that got started on the Final Fantasy series through 7 or 8, be sure to check this set out.  It's top notch.", "This review is basically for FF VI. It was actually FF III when I first played it. Anyway, this game is awesome. Its what first got me into playing video games. The story is very good. There's a lot of different characters that you get to play with. It has 2 player option when your battling. The only real flaw is the graphics. But it came out a long time ago so you really can't expect it to be to mind blowing in the graphics department. Other then that, awesome game. I only played FF V for a little bit. It seemed to be pretty cool. Didn't set up the story for the game very well though. And there seemed to be some bugs in it as well. Or in my disc there was. I had to keep saving so when it did mess up I wouldn't have to start over. I never did play all the way through V though so not sure how good it actually is.....The music disc sucks....Unless your into jamming out to old school FF music. Good music for the game, not so much though for sitting around listening to it...", "Final Fantasy Anthology is two great 16-bit Final Fantasy games in one conveniently-priced package. First, there's Final Fantasy V, which, while not being one of the best in the series, is nice to finally have in the US. Also, there's Final Fantasy VI (SNES players might know it better as Final Fantasy III), which sells individually at the used game store I bought this at for a much higher price (...)That, and the fact that it is among the very best in the series.The music in both games is excellent, and each one's battle theme has that familiar bassline at the beginning. The visuals are very dated, but the new CG cinemas are gorgeous. Number V has perhaps the most unique feature of any FF game: the job system. True, this was made popular in the US first with Final Fantasy Tactics, but it was still quite unique. My recommendation is leveling up one job to the max with one character, then trying another. The bottom line: I can't help but recommend this game for the classic gameplay and the familiar 16-bit Final Fantasy feel captured perfectly on the Playstation. The CG cinemas, which are more like the Amano art than the normal CG art in other FF games, are gorgeous, but there are only two in each game: one that plays before the title screen (and can be skipped anytime), and one at the end. Overall, I highly recommend this game, and that being said, go to your local used/rare game store and check it out!", "Final Fantasy V & VI is a great re-visit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time. Hard to believe how far this series has come in the past 20 years! Then again, when you can go back, play the older ones, & still enjoy it... It's not so hard to believe after all.", "\"These 2 games are probably (in my opinion anyway) the best ones in the series. I will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself.FF5: One of the previously unreleased FF games (at the time anyway) is now in America. I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof. I literally trained my characters (this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game) to get to level 30 or 40 (can't remember exactly) just to get my jobs mastered. the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games, this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of (X-Death) rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him/her instead of the one who is destroying the world. the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters (there's only 5 in the entire game, you stick with 4, one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter) so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters.FF6: I think this is the best one in the series. there is absolutly no real \"\"Main\"\" character in this game. For those who are confused, what I mean is that, well for example, FF7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is Cloud (the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game), well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader. The characters are excellent in this game, I pretty much like all of them (Gau is funny, but he doesn't have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you can't even control them at all during battle). Sabin having the Blitz ability. for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move, no matter which direction your facing, you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction. for instance, one of the moves is RLR (I am talking about Right Left Right on the control pad) and if your character is facing to the right, then you have to insert that command, but if you are facing the opposite direction, it is still the same command (not the opposite combination). when I first beat the game, before beating it, I got all of the characters to level 99. This game also has some of the best music for a FF game (at the time anyway).the collection itself: you get a music CD, the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8's random battle loading screen, FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies, has CGI cinemas, FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES (or should I say Super Famicom) version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features.overall: If you like the SNES FF games, this is the right collection for you (Along with Chronicles which includes FF4 (FF2 in the USA for the SNES) and Chrono Trigger)\"", "I don't play video games much but I have some of the clasics.For any RPG fan this is a must have especially if you like the old school  1 and 2D types of layouts.Colorful and simple but not as simple as say Mystic Quest the baby RPG of yesterday decade. Great gift as well.", "Great transfers make for a fantastic collection of two of the best Final Fantasy Games. This is a must have for any collector.", "OK no this game is amazing I bought it when it first came out so I have the cd disc and everything now I was reading some of the reviews that gave it one star and said that ff7 anf ff8 are way better for one ff8 is horrible and ff7 is ok but 6 is on my top 3 rpgs everything about it is just amazing and ff5 is awesome also its really weird but I like it cause its a little different they didn't originally release ff5 in the U.S. and they should of because its awesome. I highly recommend these games, but I'd go for the non greatest hits", "\"I've noticed a couple people complain about the load times (especially during battles).  There's a quick and easy fix for PS2 owners:  In the main menu under the PS1 Driver, there's a setup option for \"\"Fast Loading\"\".  When you turn that on, the game will load as fast as the original cartridge did.  Problem solved..And now for the game: FF6 *is* the best version of Final Fantasy made to date (imho).  FF7, FF9, and FF10 are also very good, but FF6 got the RPG formula perfect: Great characters, great story, great battle system.  If I had to sell all my RPGs, FF6 is the one I would keep & play over-and-over.As for FF5, the story is rather weak, but the gameplay is really really good, thanks to the job system (like FF10-2).  What I like to do with FF5 is to experiment:- What if I had 4 white mages?- What if I had 4 black mages?- What if I had 4 fighters?- Would I survive the battles w/ such weak teams?Thanks to its job system, FF5 has a great deal of replayability.  Even after you beat the game, you can go back and replay with a completely different team, and new complications (trust me, beating this game with 4 black mages is NOT easy).Bottom Line: Buy Final Fantasy 5/6 right now.  If you're like me, you'll cherish it forever.\""], "A": [0.06924738734960556, 0.01674085110425949, 0.010648990049958229, 0.0627148374915123, 1.3410694919002708e-05, 0.0651506558060646, 0.002207981888204813, 0.02012638747692108, 0.012297194451093674, 0.010754207149147987, 0.1908494234085083, 0.018876146525144577, 0.016127556562423706, 0.04276195541024208, 0.055848557502031326, 0.0023040128871798515, 0.032020434737205505, 0.0010131117887794971, 0.005771774798631668, 0.04352946951985359, 0.1084655299782753, 0.02285768650472164, 0.01134957280009985, 0.14906635880470276, 0.00954813789576292, 0.019708413630723953]}
