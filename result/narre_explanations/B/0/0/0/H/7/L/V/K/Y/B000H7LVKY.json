{"reviews": ["These sour cherries are great by themselves or in oats or yogurt.  Actually, I think they're just a little bit too sweet due to the addition of sugar, but I can't readily find dried cherries that aren't sweetened. It's not necessary to add so much sugar (and oil) because they taste naturally sweet.Cherries have great nutritional value too. In particular, the red pigment in cherries is an anthocyanin that a lot of researchers think reduces inflammation.  There are two main types of cherries - sweet and sour.  I like the sour ones best and these are sour.If these sour cherries didn't have the sugar and oil, I'd buy them all the time.", "Ok, these are excellent cherries and go well with numerous types of foods. I ordered them after reading an article about the benefits of tart cherries. However, I was more preoocupied with the thought of the benefits than the amount of cherries in the order. A 4-pound box of cherries is a whole lot of cherries. I highly recommend these but for me, a smaller package would be more practical.", "I am glad that another reviewer pointed out that these ship from different farms.  The first order I received was very nice, almost as good as the Kirklland brand (but not as large or plump,) still very good.  the second batch were smaller, dryer, maybe it is because it is summer now and it is last year's crop?  In any event I was much less impressed by the second box.  If I had received those first I would not have subscribed.  Now if that is due to seasons then it is to be expected but the second batch did indeed ship from a different company than the first.Even at the lowest price I have seen here (about $18) these cost a bit more by the ounce than the ones we get at costco... and that is in the most expensive place on earth (Hawaii).  If they had them all the time I would buy those exclusively, but they don't.  Maybe they only ship/ sell when they are fresh?I do not want to knock these to much.  They are good and a much better value than at the average supermarket.  We just have a better option.  If they were as good the very small price difference wouldn't matter as the convenience would more than make it up.  But I find the Kirklands better and more consistent in quality.  I also wish they would not add sugar or oil to these :(  I really do not want added sugar or fat in dried fruit!  I suppose it beats chemicals, but I don't buy chemically treated fruit.  These are good, but not the best I have had, and I am about as far away from cherry country as one can get.", "These are really good.  Plump, Tart, Sweet & Large. Really good for eating as a snack & excellent in baked goods, cereal, etc.  I like a cherry w/a bit of tartness & these are the ones!  Not overly sweet which is hard to find in a dried cherry.  They are pliable/chewy - not dried to crusty bits.", "These dried cherries are great when no fresh fruit is available in the winter.  I use them in my oatmeal with several other dried fruit.", "These are the best dried cherries I've found and the best price on top of that!  The cherries are moist, sweet, tart and good in everything from oatmeal to salads or just plain for snacking.I love Traverse Bay's dried fruits.  Their quality and consistency are much appreciated.", "These moist, tender, sweet and tasty cherries are ALMOST irrestible. At about twenty-two bucks they're doable, at forty-two bucks not at all. Everyone at home eats these like raisins, even the dog begs for them. I'm sure these would be wonderful in baked goods. However, as HOT as it's gotten here in Texas there's NO WAY I'm turning on the oven.As others have mentioned, these are not the Tart Cherries many health fanatics are seeking. These are sweet and yummy and worth a try at the right price.", "\"My first experience with dried tart cherries was when I went to visit a friend from Traverse City, Michigan about ten years ago.  As a teenager, she had worked in the cherry plant removing pits from the fruit, not uncommon for natives of the Cherry Capital.  She took me down to Meijers to buy this exact box of dried tart cherries to carry home on the plane as a special treat.Then a few years ago, I began buying cherries at Trader Joe's and they became a pantry staple for me. Once I realized my friend could get them on sale at Meijers and ship them to me for a significant savings and slight quality advantage over the ones I had been buying, I asked her to do that several times.  It never occurred to me to look for them on Amazon where the cost is about the same as having them shipped from Traverse City and I won't have to bother my friend.Normally I do not buy sweetened fruit of any kind but the slight amount of sugar is necessary due to the tartness of the cherries, much as lemonade or cranberry juice must be sweetened, and it is completely unnoticeable.  A slight bit of oil is also required to keep them from turning into a solid mass of moist chewy goodness!A few of these are great in smoothies, but not too many, as the flavor is very intense.  I also enjoy them in oatmeal and cold cereals, with milk chocolate, and out-of-hand as a snack.  Once, after carelessly mistaking them for raisins and adding them to scones, I got a very pleasant surprise!  They are great in rice pudding, cr&egrave;me brl&eacute;e, ice cream, and chicken salad.A wonderful one-dish lunch or light summer supper is \"\"Barley, Bacon and Avocado Salad with Roasted Chicken\"\", but with these dried tart cherries added.  The recipe is easy to find on the internet.If you ever have the chance to go to Traverse City to see the cherry blossoms or the fall leaves up on the peninsula, please take advantage of the opportunity as you will surely enjoy it.  Now if I could just get Honeybell tangelos from Amazon, I'd be set!\"", "Love them, large soft and chewy just the way I like them . I could hardly stop snacking on them. I wanted to order the Blueberries but they are gone but will definitely be ordering more from Traverse Bay", "You heard me correctly.  These are the best dried cherries ever to touch my taste buds and make a party in my mouth.  I have tried dried cherries in the store and they are too sweet and not sour enough.  Traverse Bay dried cherries taste like a cherry should taste, tart and sweet.  The perfect balance.  They keep me coming back for more.  I just eat them by the handful and have never had them last long enough to make it into a baked good or trail mix."], "A": [0.09373614192008972, 0.0778874084353447, 0.046710338443517685, 0.15732620656490326, 0.18326133489608765, 0.16915516555309296, 0.06406082212924957, 0.07782947272062302, 0.06271412968635559, 0.06731899082660675]}
