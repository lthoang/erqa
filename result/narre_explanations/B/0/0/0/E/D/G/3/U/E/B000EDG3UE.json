{"reviews": ["\"I provided some images of what it looks like for those who don't know and might want to try.Quinoa is such an easy thing to prepare.  I haven't tested it in a rice cooker and am not sure if you can but it's easy enough in a sauce pan.  2 cups of water and 1 cup of quinoa.  I'm not sure if you need to bring the water to a bowl first then add the quinoa, or if you can add all, bring to a boil, reduce heat and let it cook at medium heat...but it doesn't seem to matter as I have done it both ways.  The \"\"all in one\"\" shot is the easiest of course ;).  Seem pretty easy right?  Bring to a boil, let it cook at medium heat for 12 minutes, and then let it sit after you fluff it.To me, this has a texture that is firmer than rice, even for the folks who like their rice dry or firm.  It could just be that these grains are small and round and so give the impression of being firmer, but nonetheless, it's perfectly fine with me.  And if you are familiar, again in my own opinion, it has a texture that I can best describe as closest to caviar (this coming from a current vegan who has experienced being a carnivore previously in my younger years).  It also has pleasant a nutty flavor.A very healthy alternative to rice or as an addition and supplement to a healthy eating lifestyle.\"", "I was hooked on quinoa a couple of years ago, then migrated to the Lundberg brown rice blends for a change and stayed with them.  Someone gave me a bag of quinoa at Christmas and after preparing it I became hooked on it again.  I discovered that quinoa has twice the protein and fiber than the whole grain rice blends for around the same calories.  Also quinoa cooks in fifteen minutes as opposed to fifty minutes for the rice blends, making it a better option for the summer months.  I tried the microwave directions on the bag, attempting to cut down on electricity use and to lessen the heat in the kitchen, but it did not turn out as good as pot-prepared.  In conclusion - I'm currently doing both quinoa and rice blends, one batch of each per week, and the variety keeps things interesting.", "Quinoa has longevity if nothing else, it has pedigree and is recognized as a superior source of nourishment. Popular in Peru used to be the food of choice for the less privileged. Why? Because grains and potatoes where everywhere in large amounts and the poor could always eat that.Quinoa in America, on the other hand, has taken a lot more classy reputation and very well deserved, may I add. First thing to consider: It is unique and has a long history. Extremely regional grain. Second thing to consider: How really really good is for the human body (google it, yahoo it, very high standards as a food choice). Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa is top of the line Quinoa. Washed over and over so it looses a possible bitter aspect and turns the Quinoa as a wonderful resource and should I include: Tasty? Yes, very tasty and here goes my personal best (to put my money where my mouth is), this is a sure proof way to enjoy a plate of Quinoa.I cup Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa/2 1/2 - 3 Cups of Delicious Vegetable or Chicken Broth (never Beef!)/Cook at medium heat until Quinoa is fully cooked and most liquid is absorbed (please note that sometimes Quinoa becomes thirsty and needs additional liquid, specially a higher temperatures)/Planters Peanuts (4 Oz or as much as you want and may be any other nut for that matter, but peanut is Yummy!)grinded to a fine powder-set aside/Dice in fine pieces an onion (small, large, who's counting?) and Heat some Olive/Canola/Vegetable, etc Oil on a large frying pan/Add Fresh Garlic-Crushed Pepper (the better the pepper the better the taste!)Sea or Regular Salt (See? I am not picky!) at this point your most trusted herbs and spices can go into the mix/Add the Peanut powder on the mix and then add the Quinoa fully cooked and mix it all together/Last but certainly not least Add Curry Hot or Mild, I don't care, about 2 teaspoons-more or less, do not let this part stop you-and at the end make sure you add a little more liquid so the whole thing looks and tastes like it should.Curry, Peanuts, Quinoa! Oh Boy, do they get along well. 5 Stars for this food from the Inkas To The Tables! PS: Since I already got into it please note that the curry powder is dissolved at the start together with the broth! It surely does not go at the end when everything is fully cooked, thank you for your understanding on this matter!", "Quinoa is a nutritionally complete grain -- unlike most other grains -- it has all of the essential amino acids.  It cooks up like something between cous cous and rice taking on the flavor of the cooking liquid.  Basically, this is an ancient grain who's time for a comeback has arrived.  I haven't run any through my grain mill yet but that's coming soon so I can make bread (with a hard red winter wheat mixture).", "I am so happy that I ordered this quinoa from Bob's!  There are never any surprises, like grit, stones, etc., and it cooks up fluffy and delicious.  I ahve tried other brands, but I will stick with a proven winner.", "Quinoa is a delicious and more nutritional version of rice and cooks very easily. It is probably the most nutritional grain because of it high protein (12-18%), fiber, phosphorus, iron and magnesium content. The protein in Quinoa is complete with all amino acids (unlike rice which lacks in lysine) which makes it an excellent grain for vegetarians.I cooked Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa just like rice and it was ready in 20 minutes. You have to rinse it well otherwise the grains are sticky. Soaking in water before cooking, like rice, also helps. It can be used in a variety of ways just-hot with meals and cold with salad - like rice. It is very sumptuous, filling and has somewhat nutty flavor.For people who do not like the flavor, it can be mixed with rice 30/70 or 40/60 and Quinoa flavor is masked by rice. The biggest downside to Quinoa is that it does not store well: I found fungus in air tight container after 6 months and bugs in a container that was not air tight."], "A": [0.06254483014345169, 0.11691929399967194, 0.19511277973651886, 0.30766794085502625, 0.13003113865852356, 0.18772397935390472]}
