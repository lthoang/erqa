{"reviews": ["Y'know, a 5-lb bag of gummi bears doesn't last nearly as long as you'd think. Especially when you're shoving them into your mouth by the handful. Constantly. Which is very, very bad for you.But you can't stop. You know you can't. So just make it your friend, and buy this disgustingly, embarrassingly large bag of chewy, sweety-soury edible bears. If eating so many of them ends up killing you, at least you'll die happy.", "I really love these.  They are fruity and tasty.  I received them fresh.  The only problem with buying such a big bag, is that you must put them in something to keep them fresh if you are not going to eat them right away.  These are also nice to fill canning jars and put a bow on them to give as inexpensive gifts.", "Well, my wife couldn't stop laughing or eating the gummi bears.  She says these are the best!When we go to ColdStones for ice cream she will always add them to her cup.  This was a great idea for Valentine's Day or a birthday, too!", "I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.", "Since you can't hand out unwrapped candy at Halloween, what can you do with five pounds of Gummi Bears? That many would make me sick if I eat them over the course of a month! Anyway, these are the Haribo Gummis, as good as gummi or gummy bears get. Maybe if you had a Gummi Bear party. How do they go with Mai Tais?", "A very different taste than American gummies, and totally delicious.  Different texture, too.Available in smaller bags for those who need to try them before buying a family size package.", "This 5 lb bag is the best deal for the Haribo gummies.This is the best gummy bears that I know of. No wonder they are the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany). It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth. Not too sweet neither. Just the right combination of flavors to taste.Just FYI: 5 oz bag has 3.5 servings, with each serving at 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein. A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies.", "Just like everyone else here it seems, I first experienced Haribo's magic in Germany.  I was at a train station and I needed a quick snack, so I bought a little bag of the Gold-Bears.  Ever since I ventured to find them in the States, but couldn't.  A few years ago, however, I noticed them popping up in their little bags, and had to buy one.While they're still the best gummy bears Stateside, I was a bit disappointed since they were harder than I had them in Deutschland.  But that's understandable, as I'm assuming they're imported from Germany, and gummy bears really can't retain their freshness for long when traveling across the sea, and then sitting on a store shelf waiting for someone to buy them.  They're not hard-hard like some of the other gummy bear brands you'll find here; they're just harder than in Europe.The flavors are strong and fantastic, and I have to stop from eating so many gummies at once for fear of my jaw getting sore--but they're so good!The 5lb bag is a great deal, but just be sure no one else is around.  I already had a bunch of co-workers coming up to get some, assuming they'll last forever since it's a large bag.  After ordering this about 2 weeks ago, I'm already having to consider reordering a second bag!", "I purchased *five pounds* of gummi bears because I've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them, plus the price can't be beat (usually just five ounces is two to three dollars, imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars!).I was very uncertain buying gummi bears online, because I wasn't sure if I would get cruddy old stale gummi bears that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.That was not the case with me.  I purchased the gummi bears on Jan 27 2009.  I received them on Jan 30 2009.  They were fresh and squishy, and well packaged.  They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later.  Terrific.Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping, now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around!", "These don't last long when I order them. Nice and soft, chewy, flavorful. They are perfect for movie time munchies. I'd suggest keeping them in an airtight container after opening, which helps them stay nice and soft for longer.The price here is very fair. If you buy some of the smaller packages in the store, the quality is not as good and the price is so much more expensive! Amazon delivers these lightning fast.The hardest decision to make is what kind of Haribo to buy next..."], "A": [0.05488571152091026, 0.13999979197978973, 0.14626853168010712, 0.08715441823005676, 0.06837829202413559, 0.20015382766723633, 0.049814946949481964, 0.10423720628023148, 0.06127164140343666, 0.08783558756113052]}
