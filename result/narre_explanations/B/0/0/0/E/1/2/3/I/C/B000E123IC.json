{"reviews": ["Normally I don't like udon noodles (thick noodles) but the ANNIE CHUN'S KIM-CHI SOUP NOODLE BOWLS are really good.The broth has a sour and spicy taste, like kim chi, and goes great with the thick udon noodles. And the noodles aren't dehydrated like other instant soups, which is pretty good considering that the bowls don't require refrigeration. On the hotness meter, I'd say about medium hot and it's well flavored.It's easy to make, too! Just open the packages place them in the bowl and add water and stick it in the microwave for about 2-minutes. That's all. I'll probably order more once I finish this batch.", "This is a spicy and good tasting instant soup bowl, and it is vegetarian.  It is so easy to make: put everything into the bowl, add 1 cup of boiling water, and you have a delicious meal in a minute.  It can't be any more INSTANT than that.", "For a mass-produced instant udon, this is probably as good as instant can get. Easy to prepare and self-contained, it makes for an excellent and healthy quick-fix in a pinch. It tastes pretty good and is mostly guilt-free: 100% natural, cholesterol free, virtually fat-free (a measly 1g) and vegan. Traditional udon is made with a fish/seafood extract-based broth. This one is not. The only worry for those with sodium restrictions and high blood pressure is the salt content. One serving is 19% of your daily sodium intake, which is respectable in comparison to other instant noodle products like ramen which are typically 60-80% of your RDI. I'm one of those people who always drinks the ramen and noodle water, even though I know it's not good for me.For the most part, this product delivers on its Japanese authenticity and quality claims. The udon are fairly standard-issue material, factory-made and totally ordinary. They come in a clear vacuum-sealed pouch like those found in other Asian supermarket udon brands and are not worth commenting on much: white, thick, and flavorless like the rest. It is the seasonings, however, that make this product stand out from the dozens I've tried over the years, including my time in Japan. One is a bag of liquid soup base. The other is a freeze-dried block of vegetables. I was impressed by the veggie block. Lower quality brands just use soup powder that is mostly salt and MSG, with maybe some flecks of scallions and carrots. In this soup, I can see and taste the bits of shiitake, spinach, and scallions. As for the other ingredients, they sort of just dissolved into the soup and I didn't notice them. I also didn't see any fried tofu (age-dofu), though I did taste it. The taste of the oil was a bit off, like it was old.Unlike some of the reviewers who said the taste is bland, I do not take issue with this product. Japanese cuisine typically leans towards the neutral to muted side compared to other world cuisines like Thai, Korean, or Mexican. Udon isn't supposed to be pungent or spicy, though you could certainly add fire to your own liking.Preparation:The directions are needlessly complex. You can just skip steps 1 and 2 and achieve the same results. Put everything in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, then loosen the noodles with a utensil and let sit for 2-5 mins. No need to drain or make a mess (some reviewers complained of the awkward cover). I microwaved water in a mug and dumped everything into the mug.Lastly you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in environmental responsibility and sustainable consumerism. The box is made from 100% recycled paper and the bowl is made from a kind of biodegradable cornstarch. You can also reuse the bowl a few times for other things (reusing is more enviro-friendly than recycling). The only reason for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of serving economy, at almost $3 a pack. It's not filling enough for me (an adult male of average weight). The noodle portion is a bit skimpy and I would need 2-3 times the noodle volume for a full meal. If you're not such a big eater, then I suppose the price is right, given the higher quality ingredients.If you're not in a hurry and want to prepare udon more cheaply, you can buy packs ofMyojo Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Soup Base, Oriental Flavor, 7.22-Ounce Bag (Pack of 15)andKikkoman tsuyu. Then add shrimp tempura, chopped scallions, a raw egg (quail egg is popular in the Kansai region of Japan), Goshoku All Natural Cut Fueru Wakame Seaweed, or your favorite choice of toppings. There are literally thousands of ways to enjoy udon, but one thing's for sure: slurping your noodle is considered normal in Japan, as the box encourages you to do.", "who's in the Navy.  I like to send him a care package every so often, and these noodles are lightweight which makes them  inexpensive to ship.", "\"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that \"\"crunch\"\" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)Note: Of them all I believe this to be my least favorite flavor.  Why? Because it is the blandest.  I think this was intended to be the one that entices ordinary Americans unfamiliar with Asian foods into sampling their products, but in the process they overdid it, producing a rather boring extremely mild tasting chicken soup with of course their excellent thick, soft, Hokkien noodles.  I'd agree with other reviewers that this is the one you are most likely to want to add things to in order to spice it up.\"", "product comes with its own cooking bowl (which is very convenient and environmentally safe, because it's bio-degradable).Cooking time:  ready in 90 seconds.  The noodles were tasty, vacuum-packed for freshness.  Perfect for a quick lunch when you don't have time for cooking a regular meal.  Recommend adding some chopped onion and red pepper to give it a little more flavor.Annie Chun's brand noodles has several varieties to choose from.", "I love these noodles. I think they make a really fast, filling lunch and they are delicious. However, the miso noodles seemed a bit weak to me. But I put in a tsp of soy sauce and it fixed that issue. (I guess they want to hold down on the sodium and I get that.)To make these noodles, you refresh them in hot water, then microwave a freeze dried cube of scallions, seaweed and soup base, along with a packet of white miso (shiro miso) and some water (after you've drained the hot water used to refresh the udon.) That's it. Takes about 2 minutes total. If you have no restrictions on salt, save a packet of soy sauce from Chinese takeout and you can doll up these noodles to suit your taste.I like the texture. They are slurpy and chewy-good. I never even leave a drop of the soup behind.", "For a fast, add water and microwave product, the taste and texture of this soup bowl is pretty good.  It is a good snack, but don't depend on it for a main course.  My only complaint is that the noodles tended to be a bit rubbery.", "This is a really great soup. The price is a big high, but it makes up in quality and value. The bowl is biodegradable and the paper that covers the bowl can be recycled anywhere, making this one of the most environmental friendly food products on the market. However, what it helps in the environment it does not take away in taste. The taste is very mild, which considered ideal in Japanese cuisine. You can dilute the taste or give it more taste depending on how much water you put in, but the ideal amount of water is the amount instructed to put in. If you added to much water, the water will not be as brown as pictured! there is not much veggies as pictures but the noodles are soft and delicious. It is a great meal for those who work at the office, just heat up a cup of water in the microwave and pour.  For the large males, it might leave you a bit of wanting more. For children, the serving is more than enough. On average, it leaves you feeling just right!", "There are a few staples for most office worker, and some sort of easy to heat soup is one of them. Unfortunately, most soup cups are pretty poor; either terrible for you or they taste like paste. Annie Chun's is an exception. The noodles are great by comparison to Ramen noodles. They have a nicer consistency and flavor, and are thicker by comparison. Another plus is that the soup doesn't contain nearly as much sodium as Ramen, meaning it is quite a bit healthier.The miso soup variety is my wife's favorite. I enjoy it as well, but not as much as the not-and-sour variety.", "The taste of this is a lot like hot & sour soup, though a lot more light texture on the soup. The noodles are enjoyable, and are stored as a seal pack slightly damp, not actually dried like most shelf self prepare soups.The noodles were either easy to overcook, or are a bit softer than I prefer. Otherwise, I prefer this kit far more to any of the &#34;completely dry noodle&#34; options that don't have a good solid texture due to needing to reconstitute.I will buy again.", "I really enjoyed the soup. Very easy to make, you don't have to soak udon noodles if you use hot water. Just make sure to break them up and then wait five minutes for soup to be ready. I like that it's a low sodium and high protein too.
