{"reviews": ["I finally splurged and got this product. I wanted it for a very long time because of all the programmable keys and the backlighting and the LCD screen. I have to say: The LCD screen is slightly lame. That being said... the keyboard is pretty amazing. I love the extra controls and the software that comes with it works well enough. It'll take some practice to figure out the macros if you've never done it before, but this kinda keyboard rocks for gamers!", "Let me start by saying: I love my G15 keyboard. I am a huge gamer. I play shooters, MMO's, RPG's, RTSs you name it. I've tried many other gaming controllers over the years but they always took up more room than they were really worth.So, here is a look at the G15's key features:Macro buttons: I love the huge selection of macro's available. You can use the included software or program your own. Additionally, the G15 recognizes when you start a specific program and will load the appropriate macro set. It doesn't get any easier than that.Backlight: This is great for gaming, not so great for regular work. When I game, I keep the lights low. When I work, I keep the lights on. The backlight is just not enough to keep the letter illuminated when there is a light source in the room. However, it provides just enough for you to type away in the dark.USB Ports: The USB 1.0 compliant ports are great for when I want to plug something in on the go. Not so good for when you need to transfer data (say from a camera) or if you want to charge something (like a cellphone). However, it works great for when I just want to plug in my mouse or a scanner to import a document real quick.LCD Screen:  Depending on the application, the LCD screen is great. In World of Warcraft the screen is really useful for tracking your character stats. However, in other games all that is displayed is the name of the game. I would love to see more support both in titles and in the way the screen is used.Overall, especially with the recent price drop, I'd say this is a great keyboard for any gamer that wants more macros available. However, I think that if you can afford it you should go for the new model.", "Ordered this for my son who is a big gamer...he loves this keyboard and I would order it again...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you", "Logitech is one of the best in the market.  Recommend this to all ages.", "I have been gaming on this keyboard for 4 years now and it still works like a charm. Keys are backlit so they are easy to see in the dark. I never really found use for the macro keys but I do like that you can lock settings and toggle mute. The led display is also compatablew with Ventrillo, performance mnonitors and Games stats ( World of warcraft)Excellent product!", "I've owned now the original Blue version of this keyboard and two, yes two, of the orange. This tends to be my go-to keyboard of choice as the feedback from the keys is just wonderful. I can type a slight bit faster on these keyboards than other keyboards (which is saying something since I figured I had capped out).The memory functions for the G keys is fun, I like to create simple loops to help my hands in WoW. Likewise being able to turn the windows button off is super helpful. Other keys can be mapped in programs to do other things as well (like the media keys up top).The screen uses LUA scripting now, I don't really play with it but I like being able to see the time at the drop of a hat.My complaints though are two fold, small but problems still.The legs that the keyboard stands with are extremely fragile and Logitech doesn't stock replacements (I'd have been willing to buy them) and the keys themselves are extremely fragile around the bottom edges. I was removing them to clean the keyboard, something I've done with roughly a hundred keyboards (it was one of those jobs folks suckered us into a lot at CC and BB...yeah I worked at both in the last five or so years :( ), and the alt key shattered like I had pried at it with a crowbar! I was shocked and very disheartened.These keys also cannot be replaced, you'd have to replace the entire keyboard which is a supreme shame. I'd be willing to spend 50 cents to a dollar per key on this sort of thing. I'm sure others would too.Otherwise! It is a fantastic keyboard, I have been using it for quite a while now and really don't see the purpose of using any other keyboard.", "Put together a new PC for myself for the first time just a couple of months ago.  I built this machine to be exactly what I wanted it to be and was really pleased with the outcome.  The G-15 was the icing on the cake.  The LED screen on the keyboard itself added just the right amount of bling to my system along with a 28-inch 1080p monitor to give my new build the look to match the performance of the machine itself.  The backlit keys are great for late night gaming when everyone is in bed and the lights are turned down.  My system has had no problems since installation as I downloaded the driver for the keyboard directly from Logitech instead of using the disk that came with the keyboard.  I added a Logitech cordless optical Trackman instead of a traditional mouse and my system was ready for some GAMIN'!  I had previously used only cheap keyboards and I'm glad I gave the G-15 a look.", "The previous version of this keyboard was gigantic.  But this revision is very close to a normal sized keyboard.  I really like the built-in bright LCD which shows time and date.  It also automatically shows music track information when playing music tracks. And there's a very convenient mute button on the keyboard.  There's a few programmable macro buttons to the left -- they are handy for anyone who wants to turn several keypresses into one keypress.Like any tech gadget you get more out of this device the more you put into it.  If you _read_ the manual and have some light tech background, its likely you'll love this keyboard. For the uber tech geeks, there's a fairly active forum where folks have uploaded applications that run in the LCD window.I'm very picky about keyboards and the only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is that the software is mildly kludgy (but the software's defaults work fine)."], "A": [0.00035964592825621367, 0.012845403514802456, 0.2916828691959381, 0.3142395615577698, 0.3097936809062958, 0.0029588842298835516, 0.06772031635046005, 0.0003996742016170174]}
