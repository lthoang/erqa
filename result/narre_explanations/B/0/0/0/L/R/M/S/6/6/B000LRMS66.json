{"reviews": ["\"Although there are already well over 2000 reviews, I wanted to add my own in response to some of the negative comments. I hesitated before purchasing this mount because it looked huge in the picture.  However, we did not want to deal with sticky mounts and wanted to be able to use whatever solution we had in two different vehicles.  For security, we also wanted to be able to quickly remove the GPS unit itself.After watching the video review posted by another person here, the size of the mount was easy to see and we decided to give it a try.  We have been extremely happy with the purchase.  The mount is made of high quality materials, stays in place without any issues, and works flawlessly with our Garmin.Several reviewers complained about the size in relation to the mount being too bulky to store in the glove box or other locations.  I was baffled by these comments, personally, because we leave the mount in the car all the time.  We do not feel it is necessary to \"\"secure\"\" the mount itself, only the GPS unit.  We simply remove the GPS unit with one hand and store it away or tuck it in our pocket/bag after putting it in a protective case.Other comments pertained to the mount sliding around after a while, and hypothesized it was due to prolonged exposure to heat and/or cold.  Since we have purchasd the mount, we have been in temperatures between 25 and 100 degrees and experienced no residual issues.  Our dashes tend to get very dusty, especially during the Spring, but that did not cause our mount to slide around or move out of place.I have been in vehicles with very awkward hand/or small dash space, so if your dash is very small/awkward or your car extremely small, this mount will probably not meet your needs.  However, even a window mounted GPS unit by itself would be a problem in a very small car.  Overall, we highly recommend this for use with the compatible Garmin GPS units.\"", "I used this to replace the suction mount that came with my GPS. The suction mount would fall off after a few weeks, or when really hot, or when really cold, or when taking a sharp corner. This stays exactly where I leave it no matter how much I drive like a rally car driver.Perfect.", "\"Compared to the bigger and heavier square-shaped beanbag Gilsson mount I used to have, this is an easier fit in my glove box, and it does keep the GPS unit in place.But because it's smaller and lighter and the sides fold (a bit), I often find that when I poke the GPS's screen, that just causes the GPS to tilt back a little, and my touch doesn't register.This seems to happen more when I touch things near the top of the screen, so I work around it by grabbing the top rear of the GPS with my index and middle fingers, and poking the screen with my thumb. It's not hard to do, but it would be better if I didn't need to do it at all.One trick I've used to help reduce this problem is to sit the mount so that from the driver's point of view its base is oriented as an \"\"X\"\" instead of a \"\"+\"\" - it helps, but it's not perfect.Basically, I liked the bigger Gilsson mount better, except that it's bulkier.P.S. If you want to check out the Gilsson, search Amazon for \"\"Gilsson UBM\"\".\"", "I am very pleased with this product.  Attaching the garmin to the mount was simple, a surprise based on other reviews.  The mount sits firmly on the dash and shows no indication of sliding.  As others have said, it is very simple to sit the entire assembly under the seat when you leave the vehicle.", "This thing lives up the the hype. It is smaller than I expected and doesn't budge under normal driving, even with the ridiculous amounts of potholes and uneven pavement in the Boston area.As far as I know this mount is specific to the Nuvi series. It would be awesome of someone made adapters for it so you could use it with other products such as phones and DAPs. Suction mounts now seem extremely crude by comparison.", "This product works exactly as described.  I was looking for something for my wife to use that would not leave the rings on the windshield like a suction mount.  It fits perfectly in a lot of places on the dash and stays where you put it.  The only set back is there are no places to store it easily as the mat is quite bulky.", "After struggling with a TomTom suction mount and having it finally break when the GPS hit the floor of the car for the 30th time I decided to get a Garmin based on having this available for it.I am very satisfied with this.  I can put my new GarminGarmin n&uuml;vi 2555LMT 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Maps and Trafficin the seat next to me instead of the dash and the mighty Garmin picks up the signal even though it's not in the windshield, something my Tomtom didn't do.  No more suction cups!  This is just heavy enough not to fall if you go over a bump or around a sharp turn.  I can also position it so that it is in any position or angle for best viewing.This is sturdy and well made.  I just leave the Garmin in this at all times and carry it in the house in one piece when I come inside.  Or I can tuck it under the seat so it isn't visible when I park.Love it! Highly recommended.", "I bought this mount to use with my new Nuvi 260 on a recent trip to northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania.  It held the Nuvi in place quite nicely on the dash of our rented Malibu through the mountains in the area and on the hilly streets of Pittsburgh, PA.", "I use this both on my Azera and on a Nissan Altima. I prefer not to have this on my dash, but use the device by my side next to the auto transmission stick with the Garmin pointing up and usually listening to the voice commands....Very stable and easy to use....", "This is the second I've picked up as my first disappeared during a vacation trip.  Easily the best friction mount available.  I also love the fact that you can bend the base slightly to better accommodate your dashboard. If anyone knows of a better mount let me know!", "This is hands-down the BEST Garmin mount. The off-brand ones may be cheaper, but they don't work as well as this OG. The mount always stays put on my dashboard, I don't have to wonder if it will go sliding off ever. Also having a beanbag mount is safer because it won't leave suction-cup marks on your windshield which indicates to thieves that there might be something to steal.", "I started out using these and have tried other styles.  I keep coming back to these as they are reliable and easy to use and to position.  The ones with the stiff base that you twist to mold to your dash have been tried but I just cannot seem to get them to sit flush with the dash and I am concerned that over time the dash may be damaged or discolored.These are bulkier than the others but they work well and are easy to setup and move around.", "I love this mount! I never liked sticking anything to my windshield or dash, so this is perfect. I don't use my GPS often so I just toss this in my console when I'm not using it. Never budges at all on the dash.", "The suction cup we used before was stolen, but not the GPS as no valuables were in the car.So we decided to buy this instead for the ease of removal. That was over a year ago.pros: works great (in a Camry). Stable, easy to move... Built with quality: this is and feels solid. No problems, not looking worn out... after a year of use.cons: heavy, so you will want to leave it somewhere in the car. When left under a car seat for instance, if visible that might attract thieves (again).", "\"I justed pulled my Nuvi 660 off the window attachment, the ball just popped right out, then pushed it onto this ball. It works great, even has a lock/unlock, so you can slide the GPS out of the base easily, or lock it into place. It's easy to move the GPS to get just the right angle but it stays put once It's how I like it. I don't have too much trouble with the unit sliding around. I have a large, flat dash and if it were going anywhere, there's nothing to stop it, but it stays where I put it(I'm not a speeder and don't take turns sharper than I have to). As I live in California where I can't use the window attachment, I wish it would have come with this option. I wouldn't want to stick sticky tape on my leather dash. So far, I\"\"m real happy with it.UPDATE: After a month or so driving around with this thing on my dash, I'm as happy as ever. It hasn't moved at all, over pumps, up or down really steep hills, even with the power cord pulling on it (as I have it plugged into my cigarette lighter all the time). It's light enough and small enough to move easily and tuck away, it doesn't get in the way at all when I'm driving. I think it's perfect and I love it.\"", "\"Excellent, but if you have one from 2xxx series and want to use it with your Nuvi, try contacting Garmin and explaining situation. They may send you the adapter you need to use you old base for free. They did for me.I have a 2720, which uses the same base supplied with the gps. Works GREAT!Update:I had one of these. It came with my 2720 and it was GREAT. Also worked very well with a Nuvi 680 (Garmin sent me the correct bracket on request).I sold the 2720 and so had to buy a new mount. Bought the \"\"worry-free\"\" packaging (or whatever Amazon calls it) version. They mean it just comes in a box. Two problems: the box is too small to let the base spread out, so it is folded over and takes a set. So the weighted wings of the base do not make good contact with your dash board...at least for a while. Second, the original base I had is like that pictured in the main Amazon ad. Very nice all-black, with tasteful black piping sewn with black thread around the outside. The one I got has white threading attaching the piping and it looks CHEESY and CHEAP. Why Garmin screws around with the color of their thread, I don't know. This version also seems to be a little wider, as the old one I had fit very well in a pouch I used for storage and this one is a tight fit.The old version was better. I don't know how you would control which you get. The Amazon ad pictures show both versions (black thread and white thread) in the same ad.A GREAT product went to merely GOOD. maybe if you buy the retail packaging version you get the better old one?\"", "This is my fourth. There is noting wrong with any of them. The first I purchased for my wife. After a couple of months of use in her car, I decided it was ideal for my truck. The my mother-in-law decided she had to have one, so I got to buy it for her. Finally, my daughter mentioned how much she wanted one because of it's versatility and ability to place the Garmin anywhere, even on the vehicle console. That's definitely four 5-STAR votes.", "Although I was skeptical, this holds onto the dash in both my Highlander and RX300. The ball attached directly to the mount that came with my Nuvi 360. No other kits were required.", "\"The first time I tried this mount was in a rental car for a Garmin C530, and I never thought it would stay on the slightly sloping dash of the Pontiac Grand Prix but it held firm going up and down San Francisco's hilly roads. That prompted me to buy one for my car. Essentially this mount is a bean bag with a mouse pad like rubber base but its engineered to stay where you put it and not slide around unless you move it. The good thing is that it stays put even if you brake suddenly, and if you drive in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic like me every day you'll appreciate this even more!The advantages are:- No sticking on windshield. This is a BIG advantage as the windshield mount starts to come off easily after a year of usage, less if you leave it in your car while it's parked in the sun. There is nothing worse than your GPS sliding off while you're driving round a tricky bend, especially if you are new to the area. Sometimes it can be downright dangerous.- The windshield mount also alerts thieves that a GPS is in the car. A friction mount can be placed down under the car seat when you leave the car without needing to disconnect anything so that you're ready to go quickly when you come back to the car.- The other big advantage is the ability to move it around to the position you want it. If a passenger is sitting in your car you can just slide it to their side and they can input the information while you are driving. It also makes it easy to slide it closer to yourself. Since I have the Nuvi 660 I often make calls with the bluetooth feature while driving, it is easy to slide it towards me when I am speaking to someone in order to get better voice reception.This mount works for all Nuvis as they have the \"\"snap the ball in the joint\"\". If you buy any model of Nuvi then this is all you need, no other adapter parts are needed. It's also easy to switch this mount between cars or move it to a rental car when you travel. It has been the best  and most useful accessory I could buy for my Nuvi 660.\"", "This is a nice product.  Held the GPS, but will tip when turning sharp corners.  For the price it is a low cost option.", "had problem with the on-winshield attachment which fell out too often in the cold weather. Got this and am very happy.I put the bag on the left side of the dashboard and it stays put there. the case is heavy and sticky enough. it is also not to big to overwhelm the dashboard. it helps so much in my putting away the gps when parking in strange place since the mount allows a quick remove and hide on the floor without too much hassle", "I had a constant problem of my Garmin GPS (with the default mount) falling off dashboards, especially when I carry it in rental cars. This mount works great, though I had my doubts... its been working for a few months.", "I recommend this mount for every vehicle with a large enough dash surface area for the base.  It provides a stable mount & is easily hidden for security when away from the vehicle.", "Despite the price, this is a must have, if you want frustration free portable GPS.  I have been using the 1st one for 3 years now, and that has moved between vehicles, rental cars and gas tank of a bike (LOL).  Got a second one for an older Garmin GPS, so we do not have to keep switching between various modes of transport.  With nearly 5000 reviews there is nothing more I can add that has already not being said.", "This product is a great alternative to the windshield holder. Removes easily to protect against theft and is more visable when in use.", "The perfect accessory for My Garmin.  Use it all the time. I would not consider any other method of securing my GPS", "This has been the absolute way to mount our Garmin Nuvi's on top of the dashboard.  Window mounting is illegal here in California so this has worked out just great.  It does not slip or move anywhere.  A really nice product to have.", "I got tired of suction cups falling off the dash at random times.  This product works pretty well, depends on the dash of your vehicle.  On occasion from a sharp turn or going up a steep incline this will slide off the dash.  I may need to dust down the dash to improve grip.  I highly suggest this product.", "This is very convenient and much better than the cheaper suction ones because you don't have to worry about the suction failing. Works great with my Nuvi 350. My sister has the cheaper suction mount dashboard unit and has problems with the GPS suction failing (very annoying). This unit doesn't have that problem since it doesn't rely on suction.", "Good design, except it ruined my dashboard.  Ripped up the surface with its friction.  Too late now.", "I was thinking I was taking a chance on this because I didn't think  I would like it.Turns out, it works must better than the window mount that came with the GPS. I am surethere are practical uses for the OEM mount.This dash mount works great. Put it where you want it and forget it.", "I love built-in GPS units, but hate their lack of flexibility.  This holds our garmin without vibration or sliding around, and is inconspicuous on the dash."], "A": [0.0005966512253507972, 0.006828091572970152, 6.068779111956246e-05, 1.1609899047471117e-05, 0.05816122516989708, 0.07691169530153275, 0.0007297775009647012, 0.08066445589065552, 0.005488591734319925, 0.0786849781870842, 0.07642094045877457, 0.05105718597769737, 0.07525301724672318, 0.0012604879448190331, 9.755523298989093e-17, 3.083325659458761e-17, 0.04925788938999176, 0.06299182772636414, 0.011563894338905811, 0.03149101138114929, 0.00016507880354765803, 0.04129444807767868, 0.0038352198898792267, 0.004270610865205526, 0.055016614496707916, 0.07900987565517426, 0.07602610439062119, 4.188952971162507e-06, 1.3474279311192637e-15, 0.0011929047759622335, 0.07175085693597794, 1.2221534895218156e-10]}
