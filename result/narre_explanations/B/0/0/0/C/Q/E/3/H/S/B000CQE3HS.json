It's got 140 Calories, 12g of fat, 480mg of sodium, and ingredients like, \"\"mechanically separated chicken.\"\" But let's not fool ourselves, nobody is going to be eating a Slim Jim for their health.While these sticks do have a somewhat 'greasy' feeling, they are chewy, salty, and overall very satisfying to eat. They have a somewhat spicy taste, and they leave a beefy flavor lingering in your mouth. I can see some people really hating these beef sticks, but I can't help but find them to be a really nice (though unhealthy) snack.\"", "Slim Jim Giant smoked snacks is as tasty as ever. It has a slightly salty taste and is great to remove the hunger pangs that set in about midday. i have always enjoyed slim jim and the giant pack gave a more filling experience to a great snack. i keep a box with me in my office and pull one out to nibble on from time to time.Really do enjoy them.", "My niece and I are huge fans of Slim Jims and I love the smoked taste that they have. These are the Slim Jim Giants, so they are a much longer than the other one the meat is still smokey, but the casing on these sticks are thick and I even pulled it off but the casing was still a little tough. The meat is good and the flavoring is as good as I remember but the casing is too tough and I wish they would bring back the old formula.Great tasting inside a not so great tasting outside.", "ahh what can you say about the great American meat snack.it has been around for decades and still great tasting snack. long live slim Jim!", "\"I love Slim Jims. I usually get thetobasco flavored ones, but I thought it would be nice to try original again. I find these to be very tasty, but a bit large for a single snack portion.First of all, if you are looking for a \"\"healthy\"\" snack - look elsewhere. But if you are on a low carb, high protein diet that doesn't care about fat content, these make a good snack. They are really tasty without having any nasty aftertaste. They make a good mid-afternoon snack.The only drawback to these is their size. At .97 oz, they are pretty big for some people. I actually like this size, but make no mistake - this is a lot of Slim Jim at once. You might prefer the smaller size, which comesin a 100 pack.Summary: If your diet includes this sort of snack, this is a good choice. Highly recommended.\"", "This must be the food of the gods. Although you really do not want to know what is in side. I suspect it is some sort of addictive additive, as I cannot seem to break away from them.They are not consisted from one supplier to another in that sometimes they are dry and other times they are squishy. But they always satisfy some primal need. Many people use them to clear their pallet after consuming one beer and before the next. However being a teetotaler I cannot use that excuse.You mit also note that there is a satisfying after taste; so you can enjoy them after ravenous consumption.", "\"I've always enjoyed these Slim Jims as an afternoon snack, but never ordered them in bulk before. Glad I did because now I can enjoy one whenever I want. Much better for me than sweets.I got the original Slim Jim, but wouldn't mind trying the other flavors of this popular meat stick: beef jerky, beef steak or the beef and cheese. I like cheese, so will probably opt for that for my next purchase.As with all food, one shouldn't over-do; the extra calories should be added to your daily intake.Enjoy!Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 14, 2013Author of \"\"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley\"\"\"", "\"I used to be a huge Slim Jim fan. Ok, that is meant both literally and figuratively. I have lost 225 lbs since those days! But back then a Slim Jim was a part of my daily routine.Fast forward 10 years. I hadn't eaten a Slim Jim in forever, my poor kids didn't even know what they were! I couldn't let that last.So we got the pack of 25 Giant Smoked Snacks.I think my son puts it best: \"\"It is a bacony, beefy, smoky stick of yumminess!\"\"I would tend to agree, but for me they are now too greasy. My son, of course, doesn't mind the grease,\"\"It's like a beefy stick of bacon! Who cares if it is greasy?\"\"So Slim Jim products are now back in our lives. But they will be a rare snack food, not a daily \"\"must have\"\". Everything in moderation.Overall: 3 stars. Beefy bacon goodness, if only we could get rid of the grease.\"", "\"I loved the Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks. They taste great, and are just big enough to make a satisfying snack. The one downside it that they have a \"\"greasy\"\" taste. It wasn't too much to not enjoy though. I would recommend Slim Jims for a nice afternoon snack.\"", "\"I used to like Slim Jims way back in the day, so I was glad to get these from Amazon. But I'm very disappointed. I'm not sure if this is how they're supposed to taste, but they're very strange and unpleasant.I noticed that these don't say they contain pork, but they do contain \"\"mechanically separated chicken.\"\" They also contain textured soy protein and corn syrup. Gluten-sensitive people should be aware these contain wheat flour. Since the packaging doesn't advertise that they are anything but a \"\"smoked snack stick,\"\" and that description only occurs in fine print above the ingredient list, I'm going to guess these aren't aimed for people who care about niceties like \"\"meat-looking snacks actually being composed of meat.\"\" At 140 calories, 3 carbs, and 480mg of sodium per stick, they aren't too bad in my opinion for the size of snack you get in the package. And on the plus side, they are quite filling.But that's about the only good quality these things have. Their casings are fibrous and almost papery, and toward the bottom the sticks are coated in a strange slick reddish oily liquid. The stuff inside the casing is an odd texture and even more odd scent--dry and oily and redolent of smoke flavoring and spices. They taste dry and powdery and yet soaked in oil and binders. They knock you off your butt with cloying smokiness, and there are weird bits of gristle all through it--some chunks so big I couldn't eat them. Every bite chewed down to a cardboard-y feel. The flavor lingered in my mouth long after eating the stick and my husband, a vegetarian who normally doesn't mind at all if I cook or eat meat around him, said he was overwhelmed with the stench of the stuff on my breath even after I brushed my teeth and flossed (which was actually a necessity as the sticks' fibrous contents had gotten stuck in my teeth).I cannot imagine anybody wanting to purchase these and cannot imagine them as a valid snack food. The only way I could eat them is if I were starving hungry and/or drunk. I can actually see these going well with cheap beer. But otherwise, I'm certainly never buying any.I don't think they were anywhere near this bad in my youth. I can't even imagine what happened to Slim Jims in the last 20 years, but I'm sorry to see a cherished snack from my childhood destroyed this way.\"", "\"This review is for the Slim Jim .28oz (Pack of 100) Meat Snacks. Being a Type 2 diabetic, these are great snacks to have on hand since they are very low in carbs. The flavor is just spicy enough to make them interesting, but is certainly not overpowering.The casing is a little tough and it does seam a little more greasy than my favorite meat snack,Jack Link's X-Stick, Original, 0.5-Ounce X-Sticks (Pack of 50), but the smaller size makes Slim Jim good for a \"\"pocket snack\"\".Recommended!CFH\"", "Here it is, the extra-long stick to pick up with the six pack and cigars.With a Slim Jim, you know what you are getting - not fine dining, not ultra-high quality meat, not nutrition, not a healthy snack, a decent tasting snack that can go anywhere. My review is a bit odd because this is about what Slim Jims taste like after their use by date.The good news, they are totally edible after the use by date. Because these are chock full 'o stuff not good for you, they are perfectly safe to eat after that use by date. The meat texture will be a bit different. The sticks I ate are almost a month beyond the use by date. How do they stack up, well pretty well? The flavor is still about the same, a little bit of pepper, smoky, and salty. Where things go a bit odd, the stick has rendered (this is where fat and oil starts to separate out of the meat) so it has a strange texture. The meat is also a chewy, not the nice snap of a meat stick or the dried jerky texture, it is gummy and chewy.Giant smoked meat snack means this is just an extra-long stick, normal diameter and a lucky thirteen inches long. Nope, can't put this in your pocket - well most guys couldn't put it in their pocket.A look at the ingredient line explains a lot. Beef is the number one ingredient, that's a good thing. Number two is mechanically separated chicken. In a meat packing plant where they process chicken, humans trim off all the fat and then cut off the useable good chicken meat. What is left over, the fat and the bones is run through a machine that separates the edible from the inedible (bones, cartilage, and some fat). Ingredient number two is the odds and ends from chicken processing. Yeah, it is protein and the texture is awful - seriously this is filler. The other filler in here is textured soy protein and hydrolyzed soy protein. You'll get a good dose of corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and salt.What I can't tell is how this stick was smoked. Normally if it is processed in a smokehouse with wood and genuine smoke, they list that really big. Usually if they use artificial smoke, that is listed on the ingredient line. I can't find a euphemism for either one on this package. Frankly, they don't taste very smoky anyway. The big flavor is the cultured meat, salami type flavor.You see the ingredient line isn't about being healthy; it is all about flavor, getting thirsty, and burping. But you knew that when you picked it up. Nobody is fooling anybody. And don't worry too much about that use by date - it is still edible.", "Everyone knows that Slim Jim's are NOT health food, and should be eaten in moderation.  Having said that, I think a Slim Jim is a great snack every now and then.  I always get the willies when I read the ingredients.  I wish they wouldn't tell me that the chickens were mechanically separated.  Otherwise, the price of less than a buck each is far better than what you would pay in a convenience store (I got the 24 pack of the longer size, not the 100 pack of 4 inchers).  If you subscribe and save, it's an even better deal.", "These taste great, salty and meaty - they hit the spot late at night watching a horror flick or action movie with especially bad acting, but great special effects. Being single sticks in single serve wrapping they also make excellent items to put in your care package to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Slim Jims don't melt, go stale or wilt in the heat or at the bottom of a pack out on a march.Granted these things are so not health food - I mean come on... the whole point of junk food or comfort food is that it tastes great and makes you happy. Period. If you're worried about calories or sodium intake, then you need to be shopping for something all together different like lettuce or carrots. Don't slam the Slim Jim for being what it is - we all KNOW what it is... it's a greasy, fatty, salty stick of meat in a little plastic baggie made to be eaten in 3 bites with a cold mug of beer in the other hand and a bag of Fritos as a side dish.", "Slim Jim; this smoke snack is okay, but I did not care for it however my husband kind of liked it. We both thought that it was greasy in the mouth and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It had a bad way of digesting causing indigestion which means have your Tums or Rolaids close by. My husband is always chewing on but I can't eat them. So it's a 50-50 on purchasing this product. If you like this kind of thing then you'll be fine but I'm not going to purchase them.I hope this helps in your decision on whether to purchase or not to purchase.", "I guess if you like Slim Jim's these are great. I used to like them, but they left a coating of grease in my mouth. In fact, I could squeeze ribbons of white fat out of them. If you enjoy this flavor, then they are for you.

I was also surprised my 4 year old son liked it as well.There is a mild spiciness/smokiness that is tasty. Compared to jerky, Slim Jims are less hard/chewy. They seem to have a slightly higher fattiness than jerky.The casing has a papery consistency that seems to stay in my mouth after I've swallowed.Each comes individually wrapped and the package opens easily. They stay fairly fresh after opening if you leave it in its original package and expose only what you plan to eat, otherwise it dries out within about 8 hours and becomes more chewy and jerky like.", "My husband loves Slim Jims and Jerky so I am very familiar with the taste. I like the fact they are easy to tuck into a backpack for a high protein snack on the go. The original is not too spicy, just the right amount of spice, but seems a bit salty (most meat snacks do.) It did seem to not have as much meat in the center as they used to. And the skin on these was much harder to bite through. Still, they are addicting, and I'm glad they make them in the long length, because they are sort of like potato chips- can't stop once you start. My husband loved these. I just thought they could have made them with a bit less skin and a bit more meat.", "Considering the ingredients list on the Slim Jim they are not the healthiest of snacks. My husband likes them tho. He is a golfer and finds they are handy to toss in his bag for a day on the course. These sticks are longer than the norm and 140 calories each. They have a chewy, texture that gives you more to chomp on than say the quick swallow of candy. Overall, considering what is in them they are not for me.", "\"I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.These aren't the \"\"spicy\"\" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.\"", "I had eaten Slim Jim's for years. After a decade of abstinence from this delicious treat I decided to order these and they still taste great. Since so many talked about the count of Slim Jim's, I actually counted them. The box I counted had 108 with 3 of these just being sealed empty packaging. I will buy these again.", "\"Slim Jims are one of my favorite snacks, especially when I need something to satisfy my hunger between meals. I personally prefer the Mild ones, but the standard Slim Jim is not to spicy for my tastes. And there are times I want something with bold flavors, often I wake up with a \"\"Blah\"\" taste in my mouth and a snack like these is great for getting rid of that taste.My one complaint is the size of these. I know the fact that they are \"\"Giant\"\" is their selling point, but their length does make them a little difficult to pack in a lunch bag of keep on hand for a quick snack. I much prefer the smaller versions for this use.\"", "The Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks are still as good as ever. They have a nice smoked and spicy taste. Just enough of each to thourly enjoy these snack sticks. These are just as tasty as they were years ago.", "I brought these a few times honestly and I even saw the Jax  on sale cheaper. Yes Jaxs are bigger and look tempting but thats all they are. This has the old school taste, the jacks taste more artificial then this. Even though Jax is cheaper. This tastes so much better.", "Let's be honest. If you're looking for a meat stick (and who isn't?) you know you can trust Slim Jim to deliver.

The brand is the Gold Standard for smoked meat snacks. The original flavor is reminiscent of pepperoni. A tasty treat.

The Giant size works the best, however we found the smaller sizes tastier.I wanted to give Slim Jim a try. My 5-yr-old simply didn't care for this - the meat fibers had proven to be more of a nuisance than anything else. For the rest of us, we are debating whether we are becoming addicted with the flavor or simply enjoying self-torture with one hand holding the stick, the other holding a dental floss. The taste is pretty good. The texture and the way it works in your mouth - oh boy...", "I try to eat nutritiously, but I believe in moderation, so I will occasionally have a snack that is less than healthful if it has a taste I find appealing. I'm partial to beef jerky, certain types of chips and Snickers bars. Just not too often.These Slim Jims will not be joining my short-list. They are, I guess, sausages of a sort--foot long tubes about a 3/8 of an inch in diameter. The outer skin is taut and crispy. The inside is soft and somewhat mushy.They are made with beef and chicken, but there is no discernible meat flavor--just spice heat. I guess they would be a good accompaniment to a beer or two, but I can think of other things (salsa and corn chips, flavored pretzels, etc.) that I'd rather have with that beverage.Nutrition on these is hair-raising, even for a guilty pleasure. A less than one ounce snack which will deliver 140 calories, 23% of your daily allotment of saturated fat and 20% of your sodium, not to mention some nitrite--that's pretty hard-core.Sorry, Jim. I'll pass.", "I love having these original flavor Slim Jim snacks as a sealed emergency go-to hold me over if I'm forced to skip lunch. I always have at least one in my lunch bag so if something random comes up at work and I'm not able to go heat up the meal I brought, I can grab the Slim Jim and nosh on it en route to my other 'fire' to put out. The original flavor have spice, but not too much.They are easy to bite off and chew, and the package is easy to open. A taste similar to beef jerky, but without the jaw stress - and just enough protein to hold me over until I can get something more substantial to eat later. These aren't just an emergency snack - I eat these sometimes for a change of pace between meals. They really taste good and I prefer them to all other brands of similar types of prepared meat snacks that I've tried.", "I like beef jerky, so I hadn't tried a slim Jim in years, I did not care for it. Although it had good flavor, it left a greasy feeling in my mouth after I ate it. My teenage boys chowed it down without a complaint of the greasy feel, so maybe it is just me. I think I will stick with jerky.", "My family loves Slim Jims. The smokey awesomeness of each delicious bite fills your senses and leaves a mouth-watering flavor that makes you want more. When the giant Slim Jim came up, my kids begged me to select it. The flavor was relatively the same, but the texture leaves you feeling like you've just eaten paper -- which makes it less appetizing. I'm not sure exactly what has changed but the giant Slim Jim seems to be much more slim than the regular size ones thus maybe making the wrapper more overpowering. Not to the point that we didn't want to eat it, but enough that we will not be buying these particular Slim Jims. Maybe if you went with the flavored variety instead of the regular smoked flavor it would taste better? Price-wise, it's not a bad value.
