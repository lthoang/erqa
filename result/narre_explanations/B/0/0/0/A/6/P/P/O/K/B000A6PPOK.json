{"reviews": ["I have a job where I sit at a desk for 8 hours & work extensively in queries and analytic tools.  I loved this keyboard and it functionality.  The keys on my keyboard were beginning to require me to punch them quite hard to work, but the keyboard was over 10 years old.  I just recently replaced it with a Sculpt keyboard, but not without much debate.  I ultimately chose the wireless option.Pros:Shortcut Keys made me more productive.  If I wanted to launch an app, it was just a push of the button.  Seems simple, but when you are constantly go into an app, it makes it easy to do.Layout - this is a matter of personal preference, but I like the split keyboard.  I have used this one for so long, that I find it hard to type on a regular keyboard.  I also love the extra operator buttons on the number pad.  Makes using Excel very easy.Con:  The only one that I can think of is the bulk of the keyboard.  The new sculpt keyboards have a noticeable smaller footprint on my desk.", "If straight keyboards make you feel like you're in a straight jacket trying to type, like me, then a natural ergonomic keyboard is a must, and this one is the best on the market at this time. Has everything on board that is most useful, but the key strokes could be quiter and smoother, as in older models, and when they get that right, it will be perfect.", "I've been through three of these keyboards now.  I like the way they feel and work.  I'm in the software biz so a good keyboard is very important--  I use it so much.Unfortunately, this is a disposable keyboard.  The first one I had failed when I dropped a *single* drop of water in it.  I let it dry out for days; still didn't work.  I even tried to take it apart and clean it.  All that did was convince me what a cheaply made keyboard this is.Still, I knew it worked for me, and I need to spend my time working, not shopping for keyboards.  So I ordered another.  It just quit working.  then I order another.  Today I spilled coffee on it.  I quickly inverted it on a towel and let it sit for hours.  It still didn't work.I am careful with liquids around my gear, but in the morning my coffee is always close at hand.  After adding three of these keyboards to the landfills, I'm determined to find another model I like that isn't so disposable.  One with good ergonomics and no big L-Shaped enter key (which displaces the backslash where my laptop-friendly fingers don't look).", "I recently switched to an ergo keyboard at home because my wrists started to hurt. I play games at home and am on the computer all day at work, so in hindsight I probably should have put the ergo kb in at the office but I guess anywhere is better than nowhere.I bought it because I wanted to try out the ergo keyboards. I'd been using flat keyboards, but still found occasional pain. There are very few ergo keyboards made today, but I think this Microsoft one is the best.Pros:- The keys offer solid tactile feedback (unlike the mushy feeling from logitech's ergo kb) and are easy to push (unlike the belkin keyboard that I tried).- Out of the box, the F keys are locked in their normal (F1 - F12) position- Wrist pad is made of a comfy pleather materialCons:- Offers no USB Hub/additional USB ports- toggle in the middle of the keyboard is useless as a zoom but with a simple hack (google: microsoft ergo keyboard hack) it can be way more useful as a scroll wheel-----Bottom lin: If you want an ergonomic keyboard, definitely consider this", "I purchased this keyboard for Christmas 2012.  It is now the end of January 2013.  The keyboard has failed.  While it was working I liked it, but the key touch is amazingly soft.  I like a keyboard with a click kind of touch.  I have an Apple and the keyboard just stinks.  Nonetheless it keeps working.  Failure after two months just isn't acceptable.What to do?  Looks like I'm out the bucks because Microsoft built a crummy keyboard.  My wife will try and send it back.  Hopefully, Amazon will stand behind their products.  They always have.AD2", "i've been writing software for 13 years and have always used ergonomic/split keyboards.  As a result, I've never had wrist pain.

Looks nice and the info based on what I read about it made me buy it.Cons: Amazon.com screwed up and mailed it to the WRONG location.  There was also a razer mouse that was sent to the wrong address and the CS rep had informed me on the phone and also via email that he would have the mouse sent to my correct address.  Instead, he send this package TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.  FUBAR Amazon....", "I recently bought this keyboard as a replacement to my old Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro keyboard. This keyboard feels better, types better, and has a much more comfortable wrist rest. Actually, of any keyboard I have tried this one is probably the best. My only complaint thus far is that the spacebar is rather loud, but I'm hoping it will quiet down a bit after I break it in a bit. FYI, I'm using this keyboard on a MacBook and have not encountered any Mac issues, everything works so far!", "\"After getting tired of aches and pains associated with keyboard use, reading lots of great reviews about this keyboard, and finally getting a deal on one here, I gave it a shot.  For about a month, I used this as my primary keyboard.  Then, I happily unplugged it and am hoping now to find it a new home.I could handle the sheer bulk of it, though I didn't care for it.  I even got used to the fact that I often mistyped things (I use a sort of modified touch typing method where the finger closest to the key in question hits it rather than the \"\"right\"\" finger) because of the curved layout.What I couldn't get used to was the feeling that I needed to reach down into the keyboard (because of the length wrist rest) and pound the keys to get them to register.  The space bar was especially problematic. I couldn't just \"\"tap it\"\".  I had to whack it pretty hard, and even then it often didn't register. I ended up going from a touch typist who didn't have to look at the keyboard often to someone who had to keep staring at the keyboard to figure out where the heck some of the keys were or why I kept getting a B when I wanted an N.It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked.Apart from those complaints, the keyboard worked as designed, required no special installation effort on Windows 7 x64, and the various little extra buttons all did what they were supposed to do.For now, I've gone back to my Logitech G15 which isn't ideal but suits me a lot more than this one did.\"", "I bought this keyboard to use at work after I had wrist surgery.  I couldn't turn my wrist at all to use the space saver keyboards they give us, so I had to find another solution.  This worked great.  Anyone who has used an ergonomic keyboard will feel right at home, and those that are just switching won't take long to get used to it.  I can now type without bent wrists which is great whether you've had problems or not.  I would suggest that everyone who uses a keyboard a lot switch as soon as possible or you'll end up like me.As a keyboard, it has some nice features such as forward, back, and favorite buttons for internet use. Also has a calculator button.  Has good tactile feedback and is not overly loud.  It is not overly soft/mushy like some keyboards are which is a good thing.I would recommend this to anyone looking for any affordable keyboard.  Don't hurt your wrists if you don't have to.", "Just what i needed a perfect unit not to much to write more than it is great i have it for a long time and it does what it is supposed to", "This keyboard is great. It installed instantly and is working flawlessly....for a reasonable price. The curvature of the keyboard is a nice touch as I do a lot of typing.", "\"This keyboard is currently in use on my ancient PowerMac G5, running OSX 10.5.8, and also works on my wife's mid-2011 iMac running Mountain Lion.The included software installed perfectly with no problem.The retractable feet in the back and the removable palmboard under the front allow you to adjust the angle of the keyboard to your own best arrangement and seating position.If you think the current wireless Mac keyboard is too small and need the numeric keyboard, as I do, and you touch type, you'll love this keyboard.I adjusted to the really great shape of this thing in a few seconds-it's that great.The shape just feels perfect as soon as you place your hands on the very comfortable wrist pads.The feel of the keys is the best of any keyboard I have used.Quiet, but you feel the silent \"\"click\"\".I haven't figured out what all the special keys do so far, but the numeric specials work, the ODD open and close, the volume control and some of the others do things my Mac keyboard doesn't.My only complaint is that there is no documentation as to what all the special keys do. I guess you have to be a long term Windows user to be familiar with the whole range of the special keys.I'm using this as a replacement for an old Adesso ergonomic that has gone through three generations of Macs and was getting tired.I have not encountered the problem with the space key that other reviewers report. Mine works fine.All in all, this is an unbeatable bargain from Amazon for Mac users.\"", "I am using this with a Mac, so read this in that light.The keys are positioned well. The number pad makes it far too large width-wise, putting the mouse way out. The keys feel good - not clicky at all, kind of gummy in fact, but not unpleasantly so. They press fairly easily, with the sole exception of this keyboards biggest problem - the spacebar. Due mostly to this, I picked up a kinesis freestyle. This is the last thing I am typing with the 4000 due to the spacebar, but I do not hate it - for those who don't want to pay $140 for the equivalent kinesis product, I would certainly recommend trying the 4000. It has a very premium look and feel, works well with both Macs and PCs, and is well thought out. It's definitely worth buying - just be sure of the return policy should you hate the spacebar.", "\"I hate this keyboard.  I've been a touch typist for many years, including on those with \"\"Natural\"\" keyboard layout, but never seem to find the right key on this one.  Thumbs down!\"", "This is probably the 5th keyboard I've owned in the past 10 years.  I keep buying them because they work so good.  I have major tendinitis issues so this eases the pain big time.  I just don't use the bottom piece because I like it flat.  The only thing they could probably add to this would be a usb hub like the older white version of this.", "I've read a ton of reviews on different keyboards prior to deciding on this one. I like the fact that this is a wired/USB keyboard. Not because i'm afraid of someone stealing my keystrokes... but because batteries on my previous wireless keyboards always seem to die in the most inopportune time with me not having a replacement.The keyboard has a nice shape to it... if you're looking for an ergonomic keyboard! If you don't like the split keys - obviously don't buy this. I've noticed some people complaining a little bit about sticking keys. I did not experience that issue on the two that I bought. (luck?)The key strokes are very soft/silent. My hands rest naturally on the keyboard. I like the little function buttons above like calculator. There's a zoom toggle between the two keyboard halves. Could be useful in some web situations. I like the indicator lights in the middle of the keyboard's hand rest as well.I bought this keyboard on two occasions for two VERY different prices. Here on Amazon a few months back for $34 and on newegg (on sale) a few days ago for $19.99. I thought it was well worth my money for $34 and i thought it was a steal at $20. Granted that is very subjective - but for what i need it for VS price. I believe this is one of the best keyboard you can get.", "Purchased this for a friend who needs ergonomic keyboard.  They really like it and since it's wired, low maintenance.  It doesn't have the extreme curved split board, so easier to use than some.", "I love this keyboard, it takes a while to get use to.  You have to remember to keep your wrist straight, but once you do there is no more pain in your wrist anymore.I also like the way the keyboard tilts in reverse.  Saves me from buying those wrist pads all the time.", "The Microsoft Natural Ergo 4000 is the descendant of the original Microsoft split-ergo Natural keyboard, and although the color has changed and features have been added, some details remain the same.  For one, it's huge and chews up a lot of desk space.  For another, typing on this keyboard is noisy.On the other hand, it's a reliable keyboard and keeps working even with minor spills and desk-dust on it, plus the key action isn't bad.  I also have to admit that the hand position ergonomics are pretty decent, too, although I did find the tilt somewhat steep and I was clawing at the keys rather than touch-typing.  In addition, I think that except for media center and console-attached keyboards, they do best when wired, not wireless.  I have a Microsoft 6000 wireless on another system, and it is -constantly- dropping keystrokes, even though the receiver is mere inches from the keyboard itself.Anyway, the 4000 is a good step up from the MS Natural 2000, with added features and (my impression) better durability.", "I have one of these at home and at work. It's not the perfect ergonomic keyboard, but they stopped making the Fingerworks keyboards years ago when Apple bought the company and shut it down to use the Fingerworks patents on the iPhone's multi-touch. (Another reason to hate Apple, especially for people with RSI.)Luckily, I'm not an extreme case and just want a little more ergonomic action that a regular keyboard gives. For the price and for the quality, I'm not sure how you can do any better. There are similarly shaped ergonomic keyboards that cost $100. To me, that's insane.I do however hope that at some point Microsoft comes out with a Surface-esque keyboard for home use with any computer. That would be the ultimate in ergonomic awesome.", "I'm on the computer 6-8 hours a day. After using this keyboard for a week, I find it more difficult to use and the keys much harder to reach.  The wrist pad is comfortable but I swear it's like learning a whole new keyboard. It feels very strange. I have another ergo keyboard at home (a different popular brand) and love it- but this odd keyboard just seems strange. Maybe I will get used to it after a while.", "\"I have been using this keyboard on three computers for about three years now. I find it perhaps the best I've ever used in terms of ergonomics and feel.As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is \"\"F Lock Key Eliminator\"\".The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.All in all, this is a pretty cheap way to find out if you like ergonomic keyboards.\"", "\"Several years ago I had one of the first Microsoft ergonomic keyboards with a PS/2 style connector.I really liked that keyboard.For whatever reason, I moved away from the ergonomics and have had standard keyboards for a while now. My Dell keyboard recently gave up the ghost so I decided to go back to a Microsoft ergonomic and settled on this one.There are nice touches, such as the scroll knob in the middle of the keyboard and the padded palm rest.But the keyboard itself has a cheap feel to it (much cheaper than the Dell keyboard I was using) and the keys are a bit mushy...But the space bar is *horrible*.When you press the space bar with your right thumb it feels awful, it makes a loud click, and sometimes it just doesn't work.I'll keep trying to get used to the keyboard becauseA) I like the feel of the ergonomic layout.B) It's a little bit of a hassle to return to Amazon just because I have to head out to the UPS store.C) The price was low enough to take a chance.The biggest drawback is the space bar. Maybe it needs a breaking in period but I have a feeling it'll just get worse.01/12/12 - Just a quick update to my original review. I googled for \"\"microsoft 4000 keyboard space bar\"\" and there are a LOT of reports of this issue out there. Not sure why Microsoft hasn't fixed it yet. At any rate, here's what worked for me.If you pop off the space bar there are a couple of tiny triangular tabs - one underneath the 'N' key and one underneath the 'B' key. The one under the 'N' key was broken and hanging on. As many commenters in my search recommended, I removed it and cut off the one under the B key as well. This has helped the space bar a lot, though it's not perfect. It's definitely much better now.10/16/12 - A couple of months ago I gave up on this keyboard entirely. The noise that the space bar makes was driving me nuts. It's such a shame these issues haven't been addressed yet but I've gone back to a standard layout Dell keyboard and am much happier.\"", "When this first came out, I didn't think it was worth it's original retail price at all. The general design is nice. I'm a fan of the concept of including some tilt and splitting the keys to make it possible to hold your hands in a fairly relaxed position. The physical build of the keyboard itself just didn't seem to be quite up to par with the price. I've been using the one I have now for several months and the space bar has never really felt great. I got used to it and I adjust for it now, but it's just now quite as easy to press down smoothly as the ones I've had on other keyboards. It feels like it has too much wiggle room.At its current prices, though, it's not hugely more expensive than the really rock bottom cheap keyboards that don't have any ergonomic features. If you're doing an awful lot of typing (which happens to me at times) this is definitely worth it.A big downside you should note is that this thing is pretty darn big. It's a full-sized keyboard with the number pad to the side, plus extra height and width added for the ergonomic features. If you have your keyboard tray in a tight space or very limited room on your desk, that might be an issue.This also has a bunch of smart feature keys, but honestly their responsiveness seems to vary. The ones that pop open windows do great, but the volume keys are often very slow to do anything (on a Win 7 computer). I truly don't know if it's interference with something else installed on my machine, or if it's just something about how the keyboard drivers get along with Win 7. I've basically just given up on hitting those buttons.On the whole, if you want a keyboard that has some ergonomics going for it and isn't hugely expensive (for example, if you have a history of spilling drinks on keyboards and don't want to put $100 into one) this is a good option.If you need something wireless, or small, or you don't do much typing and don't want to adjust to a slightly modified layout (keys are in the same spots relative to each other, but that split in the middle takes a little adjustment for your muscle memory) you should look at something else.", "\"Lots of features if you remember to use them.  I do a lot of work at night, and the black keyboard isn't as easy as the gray one on which to find keys in dim light, but it does always look \"\"cleaner\"\" than the light colored one.  I've been using the \"\"Natural\"\" style keyboards for years and now I can't type on any other kind.  Very ergonomically friendly.\"", "I have had This keyboard for a good 6 months now and at first it took a little to get used to using an ergo board all over again but it was worth it. If you want to avoid any wrist pain, or help cope with pain  you may have now this is the keyboard for you. I have had many over the years and this one just tops them all off.Pros:The wrist pad is perfect and extremely comfortable on the palms. It cleans easily and has yet to show any signs of wear and tear. I type pretty much all day everyday.Key placement is great, I also like how a couple keys are a little larger so that they are easier to hit when you start going faster, I would have been nice to have uniform keys for switching to the DVORAK board but I just engraved and painted each key with the proper letters and I was good to go.Shortcut keys: They are great for working on everything, I have them set for all my various programs that I use all the time (would be nice if there was a tab that could be incerted to say what the key is for but after you use them for a bit it's ok and you remember what you programed them for.Alternate function F keys: These are rather nice as most programs don't really use these keys all that much anymore you can simply hit the botton so that they work with their alternate functions and they the functions writen on them so that makes life easy!Cons: The only con I have been able to come up with is that the space bar should be a split bar so that it can be used easier, you tend to have to push it a little harder than youd like to get it to activate.", "\"The main keys are fairly quiet, but the spacebar \"\"clacks\"\" like a gun going off in comparison. After 5+ years (this keyboard was introduced in 2005) I would have thought Microsoft would have fixed this issue that has been mentioned in even it's earliest reviews - see \"\"Microsoft Natural Keyboard\"\" for yourself on wikipedia and read the \"\"any luck on the SPACE bar?\"\" discussion here on Amazon. Buyer Beware! Microsoft - fix your S*tuff!The keyboard does look sleek though -- the only reason for the 2 stars!The main keys are a bit quieter than my 10+ yr old \"\"Microsoft Natural Keyboard\"\" but overall that one is quieter compared to the constant \"\"clack\"\" (like there's ducks in my office) of the space bar.

Ever since I switched to \"\"natural\"\" keyboard design, my wrists and fingers no longer hurt at the end of the day.

If you can make the switch to this style keyboard, I guarantee you will never go back!Now, this particular Keyboard 4000 works well and seems to be solid quality.  It comes with a ramp that fits under the wrist rest and tilts the keyboard away from you to straighten out your wrists, but I don't use it since mine sits up higher on a desktop.  I don't use the special keys, like Search, Mail, volume, etc, but they do work.  However, this is my second one because the first one stopped working (some keys no longer worked) a month ago.  I took it apart to see if there was some dirt or food or something under the keys that was shorting out the connections, but I didn't find anything obvious.
