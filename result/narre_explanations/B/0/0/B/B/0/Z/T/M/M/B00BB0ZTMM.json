{"reviews": ["\"After about 20 years with two \"\"500 lb\"\" 20+\"\" Panasonics (both still work by the way), it was time for change. As usual, did all my research on various products here on Amazon. Took a longshot based on price, etc. and tried Vizio two weeks ago. That lasted about 24 hours, returned set to Walmart and back to drawing board.This week, we purchased this 32\"\" LG product also from Walmart for about $5 more than we could get at Amazon. Three cheers for Amazon tough competition! With record speed and accuracy, this unit was operating perfectly and the whole buying experience was 100% pleasure. The comparable Vizio experience was about 30% at best. The LG paper Manual is hands-down better than Vizio's useless \"\"guide\"\" and on top of that, LG provides you with a CD with the Manual duplicated plus added information that takes your knowledge much further (definitely necessary for me). Set-up was excellent and all LG ad claims hold true so far. For our second Panasonic replacement, we're researching 40-50\"\" models. LG will get that additional business based on satisfaction here (hope to also make it an Amazon transaction).\"", "Bought this on a steal sale for my tenant downstairs and i've watched it to test it out and the picture quality is perfect.  It's a bit too saturated but that can be fixed.  Has been working great and while it's not the flashiest specs, it servs its purpose for very little money.", "I use this in my small bedroom on a low table with a DVD player and a Roku 3. I am perfectly happy with the TV and am not having any instability issues at all. In fact I set it on a fabric placemat to allow for easier repositioning than the rubber feet allow.I slide it around daily and it has never tipped over.", "This TV is cheap, but the picture quality is very good.  I gave it a low rating due to a single HDMI input on the back. There are supposed to be two, but I can only see one.  If that is not important to you, then I would bump it up two stars to a 4.", "Arrive today,working just fine that's what they told me, I didn't see it yet .. so I guess it should survive ;)", "This is an excellent television for use on a wall mount in a bedroom. I would not use this television in your primary viewing space, but it is an excellent secondary television.The Good:It's very light.Very reasonable price for its feature set.Very good size if you just want a television for occasional viewing in the bedroom (or in the kitchen I suppose).No 3d to drive up cost, and 720p60 support.The Bad:&#34;Only&#34; 2 HDMI inputs. In my case this covers the TiVo and AppleTV, and I don't really need another HDMI in.Colors tend to wash out when viewed off axis. While expected for an LCD/LED panel, this monitor seems to exhibit color fade more than other panels I have seen.Blacks are not as dark as I would like.", "Great little TV, especially for the price (I got mine opened box).  I have a lot of LG gear, all of it is solid... would by this TV again for sure!", "\"I'm using this as a fourth Monitor on my setup.  It works ok.. Since it's not 1080p everything is a bit larger than expected.  You can adjust the web browser text size by using ctrl + or -. With my 40\"\" Samsung as the 4th monitor i was able to use picture in picture, but this model TV does not support that.  But like i said as a TV it's a good choice, but so so on the Monitor side.\"", "\"I bought this as a replacement for my old TV I had in my bedroom.  I was contemplating buying a schmancy TV that had web access, etc, but I'm glad I went with a basic flat screen like this instead.  I just wanted something I can use to flip channels real quick.  This works, pretty much.First, it's cheap.  I spent just over 200 bucks for this I think.  That's $100 more than the older smaller flat screen TV I had in my bedroom which wasn't even HD capable.  So the price is great.Second, the viewing angle is OK.  If you're a stickler for viewing angle, don't get this TV.  Unless you're watching it head-on, as soon as you move to the left or right, the picture dims.  That's annoying.  But, like I said, this is just sitting in the bedroom so that's OK by me.  Also, it was cheap.Third, yes the sound isn't the greatest but - for a bedroom it's fine.  If you're a stickler for awesome sound this is not the TV for you.Fourth, I only needed this to scan and save the channels it picked up from my cable line which it did just fine.  But it organized them in a weird way.  First, it has a bunch of channels labeled \"\"CATV\"\" meaning Cable TV I guess.  Those number like 2 - 48.  Then it has some \"\"CADTV\"\" or some other label and it's like HD channels from the cable provider.  Those are like 5-101 but they come AFTER the 2-48 mentioned before.  THEN, there's a THIRD category called \"\"DTV\"\" or something?  Like digital TV I guess?  Another set of channel numbers.  It also picked up a lot of \"\"blank\"\" screens as channels.  I think it picked up the menu options from Time Warner and saved them as channels (101-1, 101-2, etc).  It did pick up a ton of channels, but many of them are these \"\"blank\"\" ones.  Plus, it's slow to change channels - I like to flip really quick but you can't do that anymore - these new TVs or even the cable boxes are just slow to do that.  Drives me nuts.But overall I am happy with it. It's nice and big for a bedroom, looks OK, the HD programs look really nice.  Lots of video and sound options.  It's cheap.  I'm glad I got it.\"", "We bought this TV for our bedroom. We don't have cable in our bedroom and just bought a Chromecast to use with it. It really is perfect. The only two things that would be better is if the sound was a bit stronger and I really wish the TV stand allowed to tilt forward and back as we have it on top of a tall dresser and would like to be able to tilt it down to provide a more direct viewing angle.Strictly speaking about the the picture quality, this is an LG product and the picture is nothing short of what I've come to expect from LG. The picture is gorgeous! I highly recommend this TV as a secondary device for a bedroom or a kitchen.", "Its ok.  I notice a little darkness in the upper left corner.  It is bright and the sound quality is pretty good.  I am using it in a small bedroom and it looks great.  I don't have high def cable hooked to it yet so I cannot comment on picture quality in that aspect.  The xbox does look fantastic.  Would reccomend for the price", "This TV replaced an old outdated one in my parents house. We have many TV's in our house and it was time to upgrade the last one. This TV gives a clear picture and is beautiful. I put this up with the help of a TV stand that swivels and moves out making this TV even more of a hot item. It is easy to use and did I say how clear the picture was :) ? Excellent buy for the price!", "\"The LG 32LN53OB is a 32\"\" LED television designed for those who are satisfied with 720p video output without the 1080p price.  It contains a nice selection of built-in features and picture modes and is Energy Star compliant.  Its price point is a nice selling feature, but this doesn't detract from its video performance, which is respectable.  With all this stated, the LG 32LN53OB is a lower scale television in terms of video specifications.  If you're in the market for a 720p, lower priced television, the LG 32LN53OB is certainly worth looking at.The LG 32LN53OB screen measures 31.5\"\" diagonally.  It has a refresh rate of 60 Mhz with video processing that enhances video performance.  60 MHz is fine for slower moving video, but will result in pixelization during fast action scenes.  To add to video performance, LG has incorporated its Triple XD Engine, which provides video deinterlacing, color and contrast enhancements, and video noise reduction.  This adds to the overall image quality.The 32LN53OB comes with seven picture modes that preset different video aspect ratios.  These presets enable 16:9 widescreen imaging without any scaling.  This preserves the sharpness of the original video signal, which can be degraded during scaling.  Other aspect ratios are supported by internal scaling, which enables these video modes to utilize as much of the screen as possible.To assist in setting up the television, LG has supplied a Picture Wizard that assists in configuring critical settings that control picture quality.  These settings include adjustments to black level, white level, color, color tint, horizontal sharpness, and vertical sharpness.  These are all easily set using the Picture Wizard in only a few minutes.The 32LN53OB supports a number of AV inputs and outputs, including one RF In for antenna or cable inputs, one AV In for audio and video input, two component inputs (one on the side and one on the rear of the television), one USB connector, one digital video out, one RS-232 connection, and one headphone output.As is typical with LED televisions, the audio quality is not its most impressive feature, although it does a very nice job.  Many televisions are a bit anemic in their audio output.  Not with this LG television.  The 32LN53OB comes with two 10W speakers that provide a nice volume depth.  If you want to listen to the news while in the next room, you'll have no problem increasing the volume to a level that enables you to do that comfortably.  Some televisions provide only a 3W speaker, which doesn't provide enough power to fill up more than a room's worth of volume.  While the television provides a nice amount of volume, don't expect it to deliver grinding bass or nice low end.  For that, you'll want to install an A/V system with larger speakers.Power consumption is quite modest with this television, which has earned it an Energy Star rating.  It consumes a scant 28.9W of power during typical use.  Standby mode uses only .3W.The 32LN53OB comes with a swivel stand, a standard remote, two AA batteries for the remote, and a one-year parts and labor warranty.The 32LN53OB is a very good 32\"\" LED television, for the money.  It contains the right amount of features and performance to satisfy most consumers who are looking for a basic television at a nice price.  It doesn't natively support 1080p video reproduction, but the video processors within the television do a nice job of hosting 1080 content.  The television also offers a very nice array of features and connectivity options, which makes the 32LN53OB a viable option for a variety of applications.Overall, the LG 32LN53OB is a nice television worth considering for those looking at 720p LED televisions.\"", "What a great looking television!  The screen is beautiful.  I searched for so many televisions in this price range and this was the best I could find.  I'm so happy with this choice and recommend it for anyone trying to make a decision.  It's so lightweight and slim but the picture quality is fantastic.  I just can't believe I got a television of this quality for this price.  No regrets!", "While originally intended to replace a family member's old 22&#34; Samsung LCDTV (no HDMI, Broken base so it was leaning against the wall, missing remote) they decided this one was &#34;too big&#34; so I have an extra TV sitting around - oh well, I can wall-mount it above my bed or bring it to my office, no problem...I did attach it to my computer and watch some Netflix, before I did watch about half a DVD on it. Here's my experience:-Very nice on screen menu interface and plenty of options.-Well laid out remote-Generally decent looking TV. Wish the base was square, though...-2 HDMI ports. One on back and one on side. Would have liked to have 1 or 2 more-Mediocre sound.However, it still deserves all five stars, because the shortcomings are expected of a low cost TV, and this unit is competitively priced, actually lower than some of the generic units with similar specs.If you would notice the difference in picture qaulity (I would, but most people wouldn't), or would use it as a computer monitor, spend a bit more and get a 1080P TV. But this is a high quality, affordable option that you won't regret**not guaranteed :)"], "A": [6.558952374371183e-19, 0.15729950368404388, 0.15424947440624237, 0.15332217514514923, 0.14002661406993866, 7.899492131820159e-17, 0.15432551503181458, 0.0019002956105396152, 0.05380456894636154, 0.0214264914393425, 1.0261247780363192e-06, 0.16045860946178436, 0.0022216038778424263, 1.8890934825321892e-06, 0.0009622298530302942]}
