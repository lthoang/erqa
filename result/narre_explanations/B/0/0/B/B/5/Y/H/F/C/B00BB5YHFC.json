{"reviews": ["\"This Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit is a work of art. The trimmer (which runs QUIETLY!!) comes in a nice, hard plastic case, with all the accessories your hair could desire, plus a blade guard, a nice pair of haircutting shears, an oiler and a good-sized cleaning brush. The enclosed apron is a GREAT thoughtful and welcomed addition to this kit.The enclosed \"\"Use and Care Guide\"\" is comprehensive and very helpful. I wish they had enclosed a haircutting link on the Remington Site, but as it is, there are already plenty of helpful videos on You Tube, which I will look at to make sure I can cut my hair as well as the sweet Peruvian lady who cuts mine every month.I see myself getting a good deal of use out of this Haircut kit. The trimmer by itself is smooth and kind to skin - not a single hair rudely yanked out by an errant/burred trimmer blade, whether trimming neck hairs or sideburns.I look forward to using this -- no other trimmer I have seen at a price I can afford can offer me all these accessories and an apron and carrying case as well!! Time will tell if the hinges of the carrying case will last for the life of the contents. A small hurdle that can easily be remedied IF this should actually happen in the future.This IS a product I am happy to use!!!\"", "Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit is perfect for anyone to use. I am an African American woman and I cut the back of my hair off every week, but now I can save time and money and I do it myself perfectly. The clipper guards are numbered and I remembered my barber saying he was giving me a number one and I found that number guard got in the bathroom mirror and got busy.I am extremely happy with these Remington Clippers because they are light and easy to maneuver. The Remington Indestructible Haircut Kit comes in a case that has all the tools you need from shears, to a cap, and even a cleaning kit so that you can keep your clippers in pristine condition.The Remington's are easy to clean and the included case makes them even easier to store. I love these clippers and you will too.", "very impressed have 3 teenagers and was very impressed home clippers love how the package includes scissors, and even a cap!would highly recommend with the cost of a basic haircut is can get pricey especially if u have kids", "\"I'm not exactly the kind of person who needs a haircut kit. I shave my head on a weekly basis, and have only bought clippers from Wahl in the past. My problem with their products is that the clippers tend to die within a year or two and I need to get them replaced regularly. I was excited when the Vine program offered an 'indestructible' set from Remington, and they arrived right when I needed to shave.After three swipes in the same area, I knew this thing wasn't going to get the job done. Again, I know this is a product that's aimed more at people who cut and style their hair, which I'll get to in a second, but for straight up shaving, it's terrible. The shaved hair stays on the blade and you have to keep picking it off, and it lacks the power of the Wahl Chrome clippers and I had to press over the same shaved area an additional two times to get it down to -about- what the Wahl would do. The thinner blades on this thing doesn't help either, I'm sure. I was so disappointed that not even 5 minutes into the shave, I gave up and went back to my old Wahl, which desperately needs to be thrown away.However, anyone wanting to cut their hair will get a decent deal here. You get eight different comb guides ranging from 1/8\"\" to 1\"\", and it's a pretty small and quiet shaver. As others have mentioned, the power cord is longer than usual by about three feet. The presentation of the package is nice, coming in a pretty large military-esque case, and they really sell the 'indestructible' thing to you on it. I just doubt how strong the clippers are given the thin blades, and the fact that the warranty doesn't cover incidents like dropping it.As for basic hair cutting, the clippers will do the job when used with the other tools in the kit. I did a friend of mine's hair and things worked out ok. Anyone who cuts their own hair shouldn't have any problems using the kit. On the plus side, the clippers ARE good when it comes to shaving my arms and legs! Granted, I still have to brush the hair off the blades every time, though the smaller size makes it easier to move around.Shop around and you'll find a better deal, and something stronger. I'm not trying to praise Wahl or anything when I keep comparing theirWahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit, but it hasn't let me down.\"", "My husband keeps his head bald and loves his Wahl but this Remington is a lot better in his opinion. The blades are more even than the Wahls allowing for a lot smoother and even cut and less pulling. The entire device itself did get a bit warm but not too uncomfortably. It is a lot lighter and quieter but it's the excellent shave that's important. Price point is not bad either considering it does a great job! Highly Recommend", "I have only owned a cheap OLD electric hair trimmer, it weighed as much as a brick.I have to say that this is at least lighter in weight, I have small hands, I wish itwas a LITTLE smaller, but I know there has to be housing for the motor. There's a lot of gadgets and a box to house them that I had a hard time (arthritic hands) opening, it was a bit of a challenge for my fingers. Plus it comes with a little cloth trim cape. It trimmed my husbands neckline ok, but not so sure it would do a great job at really giving him an all over haircut, so can't make a statement to that, but for just the neckline, over the ears, it worked fine.", "I really like this Remington HC 5850 Haircut Kit. I love the heavy 10 foot cord, it gives you more freedom to move around, especially when I'm cutting my 3 yr. old grandson's hair. I also love how quiet it runs, because there are times when he will give me a hard time with my older clippers, and I know it's because they are loud. These run very quiet, and doesn't scare him as much. The quality of these clippers are good as well. The clippers are pretty light, so my wrist doesn't get tired as fast either. It comes in a very sturdy case, so you can take these anywhere that has an electric outlet. The fact that these have a lifetime warranty is a plus. I would highly recommend this hair cutting kit.", "The shaver is extremely easy to use.  I've used it now for about a month, first with a #2 buzz, then with a #1 buzz.  It consistently results in a nice, even cut.  For buzz cuts it easily saves a $40 a month on barber prices, so a very easy decision to get one for that purpose.It comes with plenty of length attachments, although I will like only use the #1.  The only negative is that without any attachments on the cut is not that close.  I tried to use it to trim edges of hair on the neck and to trim a beard, but it is not really useful for that.  I can't necessarily count that as a mark against the product as I realize that's not what it's designed for, but it would've been nice if it could handle it better.", "This Remington haircut kit comes with a set of electric clippers that are lightweight and very quiet. I like that there are many different attachments that you can use so that the exact cut can be achieved. These attachments, however, are quite cheap in quality and unfortunately the rest of the accessories have that same low quality production. The scissors are a complete joke and you could seriously get an equivalent pair at a dollar store somewhere. The cape is paper thin and again, so cheaply made that it will not withstand heavy use. While I quite like the clippers, the whole kit is not great.", "\"My wife cuts my hair, and our two son's hair.  She does a great job, and it saves us a fortune...conservatively $720/year.  So I'm always on the lookout for new technology that will make her job easier, and allow her to do a more professional job.In the past we've used the Andis 18645, then the Remington HC-600, then the Philips Norelco QC5530.  This trimmer, the Remington HC5850, is better than all of them, even though it lacks some of the features the others have.  For instance, the HC-600 and QC5530 are both cordless.  The HC5850 (this one) is not cordless, but it does have a 10 foot cord so it has plenty of reach.  The problem we found with cordless models is that you can't do a spur of the moment hair cut because you need to charge it first.  So you end up using it plugged in anyway, and then the cord length is only 5-6 feet.This trimmer has plenty of power to handle my very thick hair in one pass, yet it is easily the quietest of the models we've tried.  My wife commented that it is smaller than the other units (probably because they need room for a battery), and is more comfortable to hold.  She also says it is more accurate when she blends hair lengths, and when she trims around my ears and neck.I noticed that when she uses the bare blade against my neck that it is comfortable, and doesn't rake against my skin like some of the others, which quite frankly are uncomfortable.  I did notice that the combs were a little sharp on the ends, so be careful when you are trimming a little one's hair.  Don't come in at a steep angle.I just had my hair cut an hour ago, and I feel like the finished product is nearly as good as a professional could do.Why the 4 stars then?  The cape that comes with this kit is very small, only big enough for a child.  If you're going to cut adult hair, invest in a good full sized cape.  Otherwise all of the trimmed hair falls neatly into your lap.The case is a nice \"\"indestructible\"\" hard case, but it is a real challenge to fit everything back into the case when you're done.  I would sacrifice the hard case for a soft flexible case that is a little bigger, like the one that comes with the Remington HC-600.Other than that, this kit is a winner that I recommend if you want to save a bunch of money on haircuts.  I have even done my own haircut from time to time and it's not that hard.\"", "I learned how to cut hair using a WAHL.  You know the one you buy at Costco or online with a million attachments for $25.  Let me tell you, there is NO comparison.This Remington is like a Cadillac.  It was quieter, it was powerful, ergonomic - and it felt solid.  I will never use the WAHL again.  Reading through the Remington direction leaflet, it even says that it guaranteed for life! How can Remington even do that?  I think this will last for my lifetime and my son's lifetime. That is such a great claim to make.Compared to the WAHL - this unit was lighter, fit better in my hand and is not awkwardly bulky like the WAHL.  I just loved the power and the simplicity.  It comes with all the standard attachments, cape, scissors, cleaning brush and oil.  The one thing missing is one of those cheapy black barber combs - lol.I love that there is no rise and lower lever.  You just easily snap on the attachment you need.Another FANTASTIC thing about the Remington products - the attachments snap on SO easily - AND - YOU CAN READ what they are - they are very well labeled.The final great thing about this trimmer is that the metal plate can pop right out very easily for cleaning purposes, so you won't get ages of hair and yuck in there - I don't know how Remington does it so much better - you would think a trimmer is just a trimmer - but the products from Remington just BLOW the competition out of the water.", "\"This isn't anything fancy, and if you can get by the \"\"construction type\"\" carrying case, the kit is actually very practical and convenient.I gave away mine but anyone who wants to cut their own hair or their kids', this would make a pretty good gift.Parts easily snap in, and the whole kit is in fact, pretty damage resistant.Not a bad kit for the price.\"", "\"I was excited to have an opportunity to try the Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit. I do not cut my human family's hair. Not ever. My most frequent vitim is my Golden Retriever mix, Duncan. His coat is so thick, particularly at the back end, it is impossible to keep it combed properly, particularly as he does not enjoy the combing. I do my best to not cause him stress, as he has Addison's Disease. Even though that is well controlled with meds and constant observation, I still make sure he is as happy and comfortable as I can make him.Several years ago I purchased clippers and set to work. I hesitate to blame the clippers, as I had never used them before, but it was a struggle every time. Eventually, I stopped using them and have recently just clipped away with hair cutting scissors. Definitely difficult in problem areas. I wasn't sure if it would be worth it to try again, with a different type of clipper, but when the opportunity came along to try these from Amazon Vine, I decided it was meant to be.I had just groomed Duncan a few weeks ago, but he ha some shaggy, uneven areas.. ( I know, I know but he forgives easily. ) So I thought I would have a go at trimming him up a wee bit, and testing out this set of clippers. I diligently read the instructions, and though \"\"well, that doesn't seem so hard\"\". Duncan seemed game enough, so after a good brushing, or as good a brushing as he would allow I pulled out the clippers. This Remington HC5850 Indestructible Haircut Kit has everything. There are scissors, blades and guards, a long enough cord for it to be maneuverable around a largish dog. There was even a cape, which for obvious reasons, I did not use, but I have never seen a cape included with any of the sets I've looked at over the years. I did think afterwards that I could have used it on me to deflect the hair away from my own clothes :)Yes! I do know that this is best when the dog's coat is freshly washed, but I won't be bathing him again for a few weeks, and it hasn't been that long, and his coat was smooth and dry. I will say this. We were both in a good mellow mood when we started, and we were also in a good mellow mood when we finished. That alone said something.I did manage to trim up the shaggy bits, and it is quiet enough that it didn't even bother him much when I used it near his ears. That is always a problem area, because for some reason he gets tiny little mats just behing each ear at times, so I try to keep it trimmed.  Even though I am not at all trained in using this device on humans or pets, no one was harmed during the procedure ! ( That is actually an important point, as I have twice cut myself on the trimming scissors I have been using, they are nice and sharp ~ All went well, and I am actually looking forward to his next full grooming.  I'm nor sure how Duncan feels about it, but indications are that he won't mind much.\"", "This product is listed as heavy duty, but it is not cumbersome, or hard to manipulate.  It has a long thick type  cord, which I need because I don't have a lot of electrical outlets, plus it is a thicker cord, than those plasticky ones we have seen imported during the past recent years.It is small but powerful.  I actually dropped it twice, and it has worked fine.  It is also quiet, which is great for those little ones, who are afraid of haircuts.", "\"I've never tried a home haircut kit. The Remington HC5850 is a piece of cake for someone who has no prior experience.It comes in a black plastic \"\"clam shell\"\" box so you'll never lose any of the pieces.  Everything stays together.  There are 8 comb guide attachments, so you can trim from 1/8\"\" - 1\"\" - plus the plain \"\"baldo\"\" trimmer (no attachment).  They are very secure so No America's Funniest video material.If you're working on longer hair, you can hold the hair out straight and clip the ends off.  It's Very versatile.The kit also includes a cape!  Scissors, a brush, blade guard and lubricating oil.The clipper is very sharp and didn't pull hair as it was cutting.  It's comfortable in my hand and easy to balance for a great cut.I'll use it again for a freshen up cut.  Why spend money on a full hair cut when a trim is all that's needed?It's also easy to clean after use.It's a great way to get a fresh haircut - at your own convenience.I'd recommend the Remington HC5850 to anyone who has growing hair.\"", "I don't know how indestructible this haircut kit really is- but it definitely is durable. That's the best part about it. It comes at a great price, but doesn't feel like it is made out of some cheap material. I replaced my trusty old Wahl clippers with this and WOW. I am so surprised how quiet it is. Wish I would have replaced those clippers quicker. The power behind it outdoes my Wahl clippers too. It comes apart easy and is even easier to clean. Great product. You can't beat it for the price!", "\"\"\"Virtually indestructable\"\" is quite a claim, and it's interesting that Remington pushes the durability aspect rather than the utility of this hair cutting set.Durable it surely is. The set is packaged in a hard plastic case that reminds me of the cases that things like DeWalt electric drills are stored in. The case is just a bit small and the items fit snugly, but there's nothing wrong with that.The set includes the electric clipper unit, all sorts of cutting attachments, a very nice hand scissors, and even a barber's cape (which seems a little like a throw-in). I like the fact that the electric cord for the clipper is substantial and strong; this goes along with the overall ruggedness of the ensemble, and as the cord is what goes wrong first on many appliances that are in constant motion, the extra attention here is appreciated.A word of caution. This clipper set works very well indeed, and you need to keep in mind that if you're not sufficiently skilled, you can do damage much more quickly than you can with just a scissors. So make sure your skills are up to the task before you put this clipper set to work, lest you create some very \"\"unique\"\" and not at all appreciated hair styles.The clipper unit is smooth and quiet, with a nice \"\"ergo\"\" feel. Overall performance is great; cutting is easy and quick, and cleanup is not that much of a chore (though if you're cutting hair for numerous people, you might want to sterilize).So, is it \"\"virtually indestructible\"\"? It's too soon to tell, but my guess is that the set will last for a good long while, and continue to deliver good haircuts (in the right hands) along the way. It's certainly good value for the money.\""], "A": [0.050237540155649185, 0.048821426928043365, 0.09129984676837921, 0.024498047307133675, 0.06399852782487869, 0.07671941816806793, 0.03595247119665146, 0.08833729475736618, 0.0761738196015358, 0.0420348085463047, 0.05085707828402519, 0.089133121073246, 0.038618460297584534, 0.08990351855754852, 0.03446638956665993, 0.04518041014671326, 0.0537678487598896]}
