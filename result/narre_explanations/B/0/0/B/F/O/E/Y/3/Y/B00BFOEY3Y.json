{"reviews": ["Logitech has been making &#34;gaming&#34; mice longer than just about any other company - so it's a little surprising to see that there are still things that they can't seem to get right.1. The USB cord is far too stiff. It is by far the least flexible USB cable I have ever had on any mouse. It's thicker than some keyboard cables. As such, using the mouse with the cable for gaming is out of the question.2. The thumb buttons are very awkward, they stick out too much and are too high up.3. Weak integration with the G15/13. Would it really be too much to have the LCDs on those be able to display the charge level of my G930s and G770s? Seems so...Other than the above, the mouse is outstanding. Even despite the above flaws I think it's the best wireless mouse on the market.", "I received this as a Christmas present and have been using it now for a week of heavy use. I game A LOT. All kinds of games, all kinds of features needed in a mouse. We're talking gaming here. If you're looking at this most for multi purpose things including some side gaming, it'll be fine. But a few minor annoyances to point out.It's expensive. Getting it on sale softens the blow a bit but still. Worth the money? Maybe. It's built very solid with excellent materials. Looking at tear down videos, it uses high quality metal switches for it's primary buttons so they should last a long time but people have reported that similar switches start to go haywire after 6 months or so. I can't attest to this yet. The material on the sides is nice and rough for gripping it properly. The material on the top is fingerprint and oil resistant so if you get sweaty hands like I do when gaming for long periods then your hand won't stick to this mouse and it shouldn't need cleaned because of it.The wired/wireless options and stiff cable. This is HIGHLY subjective. I prefer to use only wired mice to prevent any mishaps while gaming or just using it period. I typically stay away from any wireless mice for that reason. The wireless with this one is insanely good however. So much so that you will probably forget that you're using a wireless mouse. Again I would prefer a mouse that is always connected and powered. But if wireless is something you want, then I can say that it works very well. THE CABLE THOUGH. The USB cable included for charging(or using wired mode) is absolutely horrid. For people that need to move the mouse fast and with precision, this cable will ruin you. Playing slow games that don't require faster movement should be fine. But if you insist on running this in wired mode you should replace the cable with a USB to Micro USB braided cable. Very cheap online.No weight customization. Common complaint. Some people don't care, I do. For this price point there should be weight customization. Not a huge deal though.The buttons. The buttons on the left side of the mouse where your thumb rests are very nice and easy to use if you wish with any grip style. The three buttons near where the index finger rests are slightly awkward however and take some getting used to if you want to use them at all. For MMOs this mouse should be fine for most users but if you insist on having a ton of things macro'd I'd look into a Naga or G600.Bottom line is it's a very nice mouse overall. I'm a bit OCD about certain features so I may have it returned for something else. If you're going for MMO heavy features, like I said a Naga 2014 edition or G600 are both very good choices for and insane amount of buttons. If you just need a few, this one will work fine. If you only need something for shooters or strategy games, I would look into something like the G400s or Steelseries Sensei(original or RAW). Both of those have superior sensors but lack of buttons and no wireless, which serious gamers don't care about.There are cheaper alternatives, and better ones. Overall good though.", "This is one of the best mouses I have ever owned, I usually do not like wireless mice esp for gaming but I gave it a try based on the reviews and I am glad I did.Prosno lag, the wireless mice I have tried in the past and quickly discarded had lots of lag and went to sleep way way to fast which rendered them unusable for gaming. this mouce does not do this.The mouse is rechargeable and does so rather quickly, at less than 10% left it took 1.5 / 2 hours to charge up I usually did this during meals / breaks.uses AA rechargeable batteries which are awesome because if I didn't want to wait I could just throw in another AA.feels right in the hand and the mouse buttons have great tactile contact.I love the downloadable software, it is very pro.Consonly one Con, the usb charging cable is very thick and ridged, I would not recommend gaming with it attached esp if you want it to last.In a nutshell, I am very pleased with this mouse , I am contemplating buying another for a backup incase if anything happens to this one mostly from wear and tear. I would recommend buying this mouse, its just that good.", "\"I first fell in love with Logitech products when I put my hands on their MX1000.  It was the only time I paid full retail price for a mouse.  As soon as I put my hand on it I knew I had to have it.  After that died, it was replaced by the stalwart MX Revolution which still works to this day (although their so-called \"\"unifying\"\" software won't support it.) *shakes fist*  The reason why I preface this is because many gamers have used a MX Revolution at some point and the G700s seems to be an evolution of the popular mouse.Like the MX, the G700s has that molded to the hand feel.  If you're a palm gripper like me, it feels like the kind of mouse you can rest your entire hand on.  Supposedly, the material allows you to wick sweat away from your palms while gaming.  That doesn't happen to me so I can't test the validity.  The top of the mouse feels like smooth metal but the sides took a little getting used to.  It's a rough texture that frequently made me wonder if the mouse was dirty.  It takes a little getting used to.The mouse wheel can be smooth scrolling or click scrolling as determined by the button directly behind the wheel.  This brings up a gripe about button placement.  You see the button selector sticks up high enough that it's difficult to reach the other button behind it.  You will likely never use it or use it for \"\"non-critical\"\" things.  Personally I have it mapped to check the battery level; a nice feature that lights up one to three arrows depending on the amount of juice left in your mouse.Speaking of batteries, you're going to need a few spares.  It comes with a single AA Eneloop rechargeable battery.  I am grateful that Logitech isn't playing the \"\"irreplaceable battery\"\" game like other manufacturers.  At the same time, you will either need to be very diligent about attaching the USB cable after a session or you will need to have some spares as the battery lasts little more than a day of gaming.  For me, this isn't an issue because I've already jumped on the rechargeable battery bandwagon and I have a drawer full of spare eneloops.  If you don't have them, consider purchasing something like thiseneloop 4 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Chargerand it will save you a lot of headaches.On to button placement.  The side of the mouse has four buttons that are easily distinguished by your thumb as the top two stick out slightly farther than the bottom two.  The three buttons on the top-left of the mouse I'm not as impressed with.  They are formed in a concave shaped that seems out of place on this otherwise ergonomic mouse.  The top and bottom buttons are not too difficult to reach without mistakes but the middle is oddly placed between the two.  Someone with a claw grip would have a better shot at distinguishing the three than someone with a palm grip.  The mouse wheel can also click left and right.  All buttons are customizable using the Logitech Gaming Software.The Logitech Gaming Software is a fully featured customizer allowing five different profiles to be customized for gaming on the road.  For at-home gamers, the software can scan your hard drive for existing games and add your selections to a seemingly infinite number of allowable profiles.  Each profile is determined by the filename executed when the game starts.  If you are familiar with navigating your computer files and folders this should not be an issue but it may prove problematic for those unfamiliar with delving into gaming folders.  I have found gaming detection to be mostly good but the occasional game aggravation pops up.  For instance, when Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released, the software would not detect the game until I Alt-tabbed out of the game and back in again.  Buttons can be programmed to repeat while held down or toggled on and off.  One notable exception is mouse-clicks.  Try as I might, I couldn't find a way for mouse-clicks to be repeated as long as I held down the left or right mouse buttons.If I had a wish list, I would ask the engineers to change two things.  First, I'd have them scrap the buttons in the upper left in favor of a design similar to their entry-level G300 mouse.  That mouse has two buttons on the top left and two buttons on the top-right.  Both sides are easily \"\"nudged\"\" without having to take your fingers off the left and right mouse buttons.  Secondly, I would want a charging base so the battery can be easily charged after a gaming session instead of plugging in cords and/or replacing the battery day after day.  Aside from these two requests, this is a dynamite solid mouse, well-engineered, with a lot of weight and decent button placement.\"", "I previously had a Logitech MX Revolution that has served me well for many years now. It was a great mouse that held on to its battery life and durability all this time, but was finally showing some signs of wireless lag and instability. So I went back to logitech looking for another winner to serve me for the next several years. I saw the G700s on sale so I thought I'd give it a try, and I have to say it is in its own league compared to the consumer logitech mice and other wireless gaming mice as well.The packaging was great, and everything was well placed and easy to remove and get started using. I was up and running in a matter of minutes with everything installed. The mini-receiver is great and I've had no problems with the wireless performance at any point. Just make sure its connected to a reliable USB port (I tried connecting it to a USB hub and the performance definitely was off with that). Please note that although the mini-receiver looks like other logitech unifying mini-receivers it is not compatible with them. This is a gaming mouse so it needs its own dedicated receiver to give you the great performance and accuracy with low latency times and high polling rates.The dpi on this mouse is ridiculous and the accuracy is absolutely fantastic. It is miles better than what you'd get with a consumer oriented mouse from Logitech or otherwise and its worth the spending the extra money on. It's also easy to change too in the middle of a game thanks to the &#34;G&#34; buttons. I initially did have some trouble getting a good grip on the mouse, but after several days I've gotten used to it. I love the new grip-texture they're using on the G700s, it always feels like I have a nice firm grasp of the mouse, and that's a feeling I feel you don't get with the overly glossy plastic mice being sold these days. All of the &#34;G&#34; buttons work great, though some of them are a bit hard to reach and the ones along the thumb-side do feel a bit mushy.I only have a few downsides with this mouse, and they're mostly what I expected going in. First let me say the battery life has never failed me and has gotten me through nearly constant use with Diablo 3 for hours on end. So long as you remember to charge it overnight, you won't come back to a dead mouse. Still, this is a far cry from what you'll see on the Logitech Performance MX mice and others. But for a gaming mouse I don't think you can do better in terms of battery performance. I've tried out the Razer Mamba and I generally feel the Logitech just plain lasted longer. I also don't like the gaudy new gamer-look they've added to the mouse over the previous G700's clean look, but it's not that bad to look at. You can use the mouse with the charging cable attached, but I do feel there's a bit of drag to it as well. Please note that while I think the weight of the mouse is great, it may be too light for some and it does not come with any weight-system like the G500s does.Overall if you want one of the highest performing gaming mice you can buy today I think you cannot go wrong with the G700s. I use this mostly for non-gaming purposes and its just such a joy. From the nice feel of each mouse click to the phenomenal level of accuracy and precision - this is just the best mouse I've ever used and easily puts my Logitech MX Revolution to shame.", "\"Most people looking to buy a mouse will probably want something simpler. However, if you are really into gaming or you constantly find yourself entering sequences of keystrokes, this mouse can save you a lot of time.Every button on the mouse is programmable. Sure, you get the expected buttons - left, right, and middle mouse buttons, as well as two buttons pre-programmed to forward and back - but even these can be reprogrammed via Logitech's easy-to-use utility, which is a ~50MB download you get from logitech.com (the exact address is included with the mouse). I often use copy/paste (CTRL + C then CTRL + V), which I can now do with two mouse clicks. I also appreciated not having *another* driver/utility disc to keep.I found the mouse itself very ergonomic, and the plethora of buttons takes some getting used to but eventually feel comfortable. The one thing I'm not a huge fan of is the scroll wheel - after almost two weeks of using it it still acts like it has a mind of its own, sometimes continuing to scroll for a split-second after I've stopped, and the force required to press it (for the middle mouse button feature) is far greater than any other button on the mouse.Setup was incredibly easy, but when I went to use the online registration this model of mouse wasn't available yet (as of 5 p.m. May 9, 2013) and there's no \"\"other\"\" option.\"", "A bit finicky but once you get the hang of it its really nice. The extra keys are helpful. The only downside is you have to map them to get them to function. And they basically become a keyboard key. I was expecting more keys, not just having current keys more accessible. but for a first time gaming mouse buy I feel like it more than meets all my needs.", "Prior to getting my hands on this G700s dedicated gaming mouse, I've done all of my gaming with standard mice - all of them Logitech, since they've proven to be the best mouse manufacturer, in my experience. While the average, everyday mouse is perfectly fine for gaming, THIS mouse, as one would expect, clearly blows the others out of the water!For the cool hundred note (at this writing) that you'll drop for this mouse, you get up to five gamer profiles that will automatically load into the mouse via the software that you can download from Logitech's site. Searching the site blind does not automatically lead you to the downloads associated with this mouse, nor does the Logitech G700s specifically come up for registration purposes (you can register your mouse simply as the Logitech G700, but the image, and, I'm guessing, specific mouse you're registering, is NOT this one), so that's something to keep in mind... But, once you've tracked down and installed the gaming software, the customization options for this mouse are wide-ranging, and pretty much all-encompassing...While in the gaming software, you can highlight each individual button on the generously-sized mouse for assignation of any of a long list of options from the drop-down menu. And there are plenty of options, just as there are plenty of buttons to put to use here. The setup is quick and, for the most part, easy, but, while this worked for the perhaps more-intelligent, less-buggy games that I play online (Guild Wars 2, Tera, and The Witcher 2), some others that are not intended as hard-core games (such as The Sims 3) didn't take the settings quite as quickly and easily. Since I'm one of those, just-wanna-pick-up-and-learn-on-the-fly sorts, I still have to do some tweaking of my button settings, and I feel that'll be the case for anyone else that's new to a proper, worth-every-penny dedicated gaming mouse, but for those of you that have already set up and used a dedicated gaming mouse, adjusting your G700s will probably be easy as pie for you.Overall, this mouse has plenty of options to offer for anyone that's looking to take their gaming to the next level. You'll want to take the time to properly set this mouse up, though. My Windows 7 x64 system detected the mouse automatically, but only as a very basic mouse. My driver updating program, DriverMax, also detected it, but not with its specific settings, and ended up installing a basic universal driver for it as an update - that driver removed all of the gaming functionality of the G700s, so I had to roll back from it. Until you update and/or install all of the software associated with this mouse, it will move super-slow as you try to navigate around your desktop, but, once the dedicated software is installed, you'll be up to faster speeds and responsiveness than you've possibly ever experienced with a mouse.In the hand, this mouse completely fills mine with its large size, and it's definitely meant for manipulating it claw-style. There's even a small lip or platform for the rightie to nest his or her thumb below the four navigation buttons on the left side of it. For the desktop user, the included USB cables provide all that you could hope for in maintenance and length for this mouse - the Eneloop battery mine arrived containing had a 2/3 charge to it, and after just about two days of everyday and gaming use, I needed to attach the micro USB charger to it. Since that cable is plenty long, I had no problems gaming and navigating with the mouse while it was charging, and it didn't take long to get back to a full charge - just a few hours. The surface texture of the mouse also makes it very comfortable in the hand, and makes it easy to grip, even should you be one that ends up getting sweaty palms over the course of your gaming sessions. The laser sensor also seems to work well over multiple surfaces, going by my experience, although I can't speak to effectiveness over clear glass surfaces... I suspect it might not quite be able to tackle clear glass, but I'm really not sure, so don't quote me on it... It also glides pretty well over most surfaces, but I've felt it snag a bit on a spot or two on my mouse pad where I see nothing to impede its movement.The packaging of this mouse is really well-done, and, from the moment you pick up the non-clamshell closure box (thank GOD!), to the unpacking and utilization of this mouse, it leaves nothing to be desired. it really does cover all the bases that I think any gamer out there, and any user, in general, could want. Logitech has delivered for me with every product I've ever purchased from them, their customer service and warranty exchange policies have always left me more than satisfied, and I have no doubt that this mouse will prove to be the best I've ever used! So far, so awesome!", "\"We're a very avid gaming household who tend to buy and cycle through a lot of different mice, so we're always on the lookout to try something new.  I prefer more simplistic mice where as my other half wants more buttons than you can shake a stick at.  So when I saw this mouse I thought it would be the perfect item for me to test out and review.  Here are my thoughts on the Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse;Pros+ Usable both wired and wirelessly.+ Quick and easy installation.+ 13 programmable buttons.+ Patterned textures on the side of the mouse makes gripping easier.+ Left flange allows your thumb to guide the mouse movement easily.+ Internal memory allows you to store 5 different profiles.+ Middle mouse button can be used to click left and right.  Scroll wheel can also be switched to silent (no clicking while scrolling).+ Removable rechargeable battery included.+ Wireless adapter stores in the battery case beneath the mouse.+ Instantly adjust your DPI.+ Great ergonomic design.+ Smooth glide movement.+ Lengthy USB cable.+ Sleek and simple look.Cons- Not really designed for ambidextrous use.  Sorry lefties!- May be a bit too heavy for some users.- Wireless battery life could be a little longer.- No charging dock.- A bit spendy.The \"\"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse\"\" is a solid and well thought out gaming mouse aimed toward MMO and FPS players but usable by all.  This mouse has quickly become my new favorite gaming mouse.  Its sturdy construction, excellent ergonomic shape, numerous button layouts and incredible accuracy make this mouse easy to recommend.  The option of wired/wireless use is a fantastic feature and switching between the two is seamless.  The lack of a charging stand is a bit of a miss on Logitech's part, especially at the price point.  But, overall this is an outstanding multi-functional gaming mouse sure to please even the most hardcore players while being equally functional for everyday use.  Thumbs up.\"", "I bought this as I used to have a Logitech G500 which was a great mouse. I wanted to continue in that fashion and try wireless for the first time.Pros:- I like all the buttons and their placement. I don't seem to have a hard time differentiating between them all- The smooth scroll is worth it. It is weird sometimes the scroll wheel will &#34;bounce back&#34; even though I didn't want it to- I like the option of wired / wireless- The texture is nice and I liked the weight of the mouse- I like that you can put the dongle into the mouseCons:- The cord to connect / charge is a bit stiff.- The software that it comes with is somewhat un-intuitive- The battery life is horrible, even on energy savings, it should get better than thisOverall I like the mouse but I don't use it as much as some more hardcore people do. Also I don't really change dpi's much or utilize macros. You're probably wondering why I bought it when others would do but I just wanted to try this mouse out and it worked well enough for me to keep.", "\"I've been a trackball fanatic for years - mice could not compete with the accuracy, especially with the Q-Ball size trackballs. Unfortunately, the quality of the larger trackballs made today is terrible (I went through four in five months!) - so I've been using mice again. This \"\"gaming\"\" mouse is perfect for graphics, touchup, etc. Why? The on-the-fly resolution. Pressing a button allows me to change the on-screen accuracy for pixel perfect editing.The ability to record macros is also a big bonus. I could create custom actions in Photoshop, but when I'm doing batch editing, I'd love the ability to create one-key macros. I could define hot-keys, but Photoshop already uses the bulk of them.  Now it's just a mouse-button away! Click - contrast, saturation, sharpness adjusted. Click - specific filter is run. Makes my editing easier and fast!Other notable points: Uses a rechargeable AA battery, so when the battery eventually dies, you can replace it! Very smooth operation - it glides across my desk. The wheel can be adjusted so it ratchets/clicks or not. LED's on the side of the mouse indicate the current profile - I would prefer a number. You have five profiles and three lights, but once you learn the \"\"code\"\" it's pretty easy. Battery life is long, and you can go wired or wireless. When wired, it also charges the battery. The scroll wheel has a nice ribbed rubber surface, and the sides of the mouse has a slight texture.  There's also a power switch on the bottom, and a storage compartment next to the battery (under the door) for the transmitter.There's no software with the mouse, and only minimal instructions - you need to visit the Logitech website to download the driver and configuration software (free.) From unpacking to use it was less than 5 minutes.\"", "Logitech replaced my G9X when it went kaput under warranty with this model. I could have chosen a G500 or G600 but went with this one because it has a universal usb wireless adapter, plenty of cable if I choose the wired mode and it fits my hands well. It has all the usual logitech features plus a few more that the G9X. I like it and give it 5 stars.***2/26/2014*** IMHO they would have a much better product if they incorporated a woven fabric charge cord because when you do use it as a corded version the cord tends to move this sensitive mouse you almost have to place the cord somewhere above the mouse to ensure no movement whilst gaming....other than that it has all the bells and whistles.***7/7/2014*** Forgot to mention the battery life. IMO they should use two batteries to get longer life when wireless. The single (1900mAh) battery discharges fairly fast when in use (like 2-4 hrs)even with high capacity (2500mAh) eneloop HR6 you only get another 2 hrs at best.", "\"For me, the Logitech G700S is a replacement from theLogitech  Performance MXthat I've been using for the last two years. I've also use the G700, and the G700S is a noticeable improvement from that mouse and addresses some of its faults.INSTALLATIONVery easy to install. Simply plug in the USB receiver and your computer should automatically install the drivers. There is no driver disc to use, which is great because I can't stand some of the software that comes with mice and sits in your system tray. Although you can download Logitech Gaming Software from Logitech's web site, which will allow you more fine tuning, and also easily explain what the buttons do.SOFTWAREI installed the Logitech Gaming Software, and noticed a lot of updates since the last time I used it, especially with this mouse. The software allows full customization of the buttons and sensitivity levels.  You can use the software to set up profiles for individual games, which the G700 will remember and automatically switch to at loading, or by pressing the profile button on the mouse. The software also has built-in profiles for specific games, and will automatically scan your system for known games and assign profiles. There are 260 profiles built in, and within a few seconds, Logitech found 6 on my system and assigned profiles to them.  I found this to be a very useful feature and the profiles I viewed seem to be fairy well though out.  You can customize the DPI on the fly, which relates to the mouse cursor Dots Per Inch and determines the mouse reading and movement on the screen. Higher DPI provides for smoother movement and faster cursor speed.WIRELESS TECHNOLOGYI've been using wireless mice for several years now, and had a lot of misses with previous mice which had terrible recharging options.  Like the MX, the G700S uses anEneloop 2000mAh AA, Ni-MH Rechargeable Batterywhich is recharged through a micro USB cable that must be plugged into your computer (there is no AC connection). If your battery starts to run down during a session, you can connect the charging cable and still use the mouse, but it can be a little awkward to play with it. I had a lot of success with the Performance MX charging, with the battery still holding a full charge after extensive use for two years, Since the G700 uses the same technology, I think it is likely I will find the same results with it. The G700 uses three LED lights on the side of the mouse to show battery life, however they are not always on, and are only activated when the mouse comes out of sleep mode. The MX has the battery life indicator on the top of the mouse, which I found easier to see.  The USB receiver is very tiny and can easily be removed and taken to another computer, which makes the G700 very portable.  It also comes with an extension cable which will give you another 4 feet.  Without the extension cable, I was able to get reliable performance from a distance of about five feet. Between 5-7 feet, the connection became spotty, and any farther and it wouldn't respond.  I use the extension cable to keep the receiver less than 2 feet away from my mouse and received great performance.FORM FACTORLike the Performance MX, the G700 has a nice feel to it and is very comfortable under your hand.  It has a slightly smaller footprint, and is designed for a right-handed person. You can use it as a left-hander, but it is going to feel very awkward since it is designed to wrap under your thumb. The mouse has a textured pattern on the sides for a nice tactile feel to it. The DPI buttons are above the index finger position and very easy to access. The thumb cluster has four buttons and is also easy to reach and has a soft \"\"click\"\" to the buttons to give you good response when engaging a profile. The scroll wheel is in a good position, and can easily be switched from free-wheeling to a click wheel from a middle button, however I really feel like it should have been moved to the right side and had a programmable button put in its place.PERFORMANCEThe macro controls on the mouse are great, and perform very quickly. They are easy to set up using the software and can really improve your gaming experience. You can adjust the mouse from 200 to 8200 DPI. 8200 is insanely fast for a gaming mouse, and the highest I've seen by far.  Realistically, you're not going to get any use out of much more than 4500 DPI in an FPS game. Any higher than that and you will find the cursor flying all over the screen. It is really great though to be able to go from 800 DPI when I need precision for a head shot, and then switch straight to 4000 for quick movement. Many people might want to use this as a wired mouse. I think the cable they shipped with it is a bit too heavy and would prefer something 20% lighter, however I will almost never use it wired so this isn't as big of a deal for me.  I tried the mouse for several hours wireless, and wired, and didn't notice any latency issues when using it wireless.I didn't use the original G700 enough to really notice a difference between it and the G700S, but if you currently have a G700, I don't think you need to upgrade. But going from a Performance MX to a real gaming mouse makes a huge difference.  Even if not used for gaming, the response on this mouse is very nice and I think it works well for general non-gaming applications as well.\"", "I am a girl and I am a gamer. I know, I know, I am like a mythical unicorn; girls playing video games? No way! But, just like guys, I do exist, and I have gaming needs, too. Namely a mouse that is durable, accurate, has a good battery life, and can be programmed to map attacks to different buttons. In short, I needed a gaming mouse, and with the release of the Logitech G700s, my l33t skills in World of Warcraft became even l33ter!ConstructionSince the product description does a fairly good job of explaining the technical details, I won't elaborate on those specs here. However, I can describe that mouse in terms of design, so here goes.&#8226; The mouse is contoured to comfortably allow your hand to rest during gaming sessions. The mouse is big enough for someone with large hands, but still designed so that all shapes can use the G700s without pain/discomfort. In addition the mouse is slightly textured so that your fingers will remain in place so that you're aligned with the buttons and can use them 1) accurately, and 2) easily.&#8226; The mouse can be used wirelessly or while the charging cable is plugged in; the cord plugs into the mouse from the front center. The plug slides in and fits the profile of the mouse so that the cable doesn't stick out or inadvertently pop off while playing.&#8226; The buttons on the side of the mouse do &#34;click&#34; slightly to indicate that they have been pressed. They are also small, but you will quickly adapt to selecting the desired one after a few uses.&#8226; The mouse is relatively lightweight, but still heavy enough to control easily.&#8226; The three lights on the left side of the mouse toward the front indicate the battery charge. Green means that it is fully charged, yellow means it is starting to wear down, and red means plug it in ASAP.Well, Does It Work?The first thing that you will notice when using the Logitech G700s mouse is that the laser sensitivity enables the cursor to fly across the screen. The other thing is that it is faster if the charging cord is plugged in; if you remove the cable there is a bit of lag and then the cursor will move again. However, once the cursor moves you will definitely notice that some of the speed/sensitivity of the mouse has decreased.When it comes to programming the G700s, I want to offer a bit of a warning; if you are already using a Logitech gaming keyboard and have a profile established with the Logitech software, plugging in the mouse may bring up a prompt indicating that the profiles have been found and whether to keep them. If you are not careful, you may accidentally wipe out your saved macros.That being said, the software included with the mouse is intuitive and makes it very easy to map commands to the buttons on the mouse. In addition, you are able to save up to five different character profiles that you can switch easily, enabling you to have greater control of multiple characters and/or games.Final SayIf you are looking for a good gaming mouse that will allow you to program macros and react more smoothly to the action on-screen, then the Logitech G700s laser mouse is the way to go. While it is pricy, the flexibility of using it wireless or corded, the multiple buttons to ensure you will be able to control every last ability of your characters, the ergonomic design, and the great battery life all add up to an awesome gaming experience. If you want to develop an advantage over other players, the extra price of this mouse is justifiable; alternatively, if you are a CAD engineer and want precision movement, the G700s can fit the bill.
