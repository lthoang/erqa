{"reviews": ["This has been my typical morning coffee ever since I first tried it in December 2011.  So, a year and a half later, and I'm still liking it - and recommending it.The pods were novel back in 2011, and the price of other K-Cups had gone up much more than I liked, so I decided to give this brand a try.  I'm glad that I did.  I really enjoy this Fog Chaser variety, and the Subscribe & Save price (~$25 right now) is good for 80 cups these days.  Plus, they started including a plastic container in each 80-pack that you can store your pods in after you open up one of the eight-count bags.  I had already bought an air-tight container to keep them fresh (I originally just used zip-lock bags), but it's a nice touch.In my Breville brewer, these pods do take longer to make a cup than a regular K-Cup.  Maybe it's just my brewer, but perhaps there's more flow resistance in these.  Not a huge deal, but I thought it was worth mentioning.I'm not sure how much less plastic these have versus the original K-Cups.  They don't have the plastic cup, but the rim is a lot thicker plastic on these, and they come in plastic bags with a plastic container in each 80-pack.  But, I don't buy them because I think there's less plastic.  I buy them because I like the taste and the price is good.", "This coffee is full bodied and very smooth.  I appreciate the more ecologically-friendly packaging and reasonable price...but those are secondary to the taste of the coffee.  The only small issue I have is that the coffee does leave a little residue in the cup, but not a biggie to me.", "Fog Chaser is the perfect name for this coffee.This is a tasty cup of coffee! It's bold enough to wake me up but not harsh. Strong, full bodied, smooth and aromatic. I usually brew this on the 10 oz setting and drink it with almond milk added. Very yummy. I can drink a lot of this coffee.I love the smaller amount of plastic involved with these k-cups. For freshness, I keep them in a small tupperware container and I love getting that scent of coffee when I open it up.I'm not sure where &#34;Can be cleaned and reused&#34; comes into play, but the plastic bags the pods come in says &#34;Compostable&#34; which I find totally awesome.", "\"I'm a fan of this coffee and only tried it after I was getting tired of paying too much for the K-Cups.  I liked their Breakfast blend so I went for this Fog Chaser also. This is a strong/darker coffee that definitely help shake the fog away in the morning.  I liked it so much, that I had a second cup (something I don't usually do) and while I still felt awake, I wasn't jittery.I will keep with this brand and continue to try different blends.One question though, is the plastic container the box comes with to be used for putting the used \"\"pod\"\" in, do you open up the coffee itself and use the grounds only in the container for compost?  Just new to this whole brand and was wondering what the purpose of the container is.thanks!\"", "Really love this newly designed cup for my Keurig. Coffee is delicious and aromatic. Less plastic waste is produced and the price is much lower than the traditional k-cups.", "Love this stuff. Great rich brew, strong but not bitter. And the cups work just fine and are a bonus for being 'green.' The cups are bagged 8 per plastic pack (10 packs in this 80 cup box) so I go through them quickly enough. All I do is keep the bagged tightly clipped after opening.", "I didn't like  Fog Chaser at all in the beginning because it's so strong but after 10 cups, I've adapted.  I have to add creamer, which I'd rather not do but maybe I won't have to after another 10 cups.  I didn't realize it was such a dark roast.I  like the lack of plastic on the bottom of the cup and the fact that it's a Fair Trade Coffee so I'll  order a different flavor.I wish San Francisco Bay would label the coffee as light, medium or dark roast.I called SFB and the very nice rep suggested Breakfast Blend for me next time.San Francisco Bay is a quality company that cares about it's customers and the environment.", "First:  This coffee tastes amazing. Full-bodied. Not at all bitter.Second: SFBC's design of K-Cups saves plastic... and NOT at the expense of taste.Make sure you keep your unused ones in a sealed container.Make sure you drink lots of this coffee.And make sure you don't run out! Reorder often!", "\"I previously purchased a smaller quantity package of this coffee and, liking it as much as I did, I purchased this 80 count package as the price per cup is about 18% less per cup.  This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"\"clean\"\" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  I believe I have found a new favorite coffee!\"", "Pleasing taste and a pleasant lingering aftertaste! As long as Amazon is able to keep it at or below $25.00 on Subscribe and Save there is no reason to buy elsewhere. San Francisco Bay makes good coffee and this price makes K-cups very affordable. But try it for the taste alone! You will be pleased. It is smoooooth!!", "\"I loved Breakfast Blend by this coffee company so I decided to try out Fog Chaser as a new variety to rotate in for our K cup blends.This one was not to our liking for me or my husband and he said it tasted like \"\"bitter water\"\" and I did not think it had enough depth and it was not a true lively breakfast blend type of roast. I won't be buying this again but would like to recommend Breakfast Blend instead if you are looking for a great coffee in great packaging that helps reduce waste. The plastic tub to put the pods in was a great touch, thank you!\""], "A": [0.03877869248390198, 0.19192847609519958, 0.12347758561372757, 0.0659039169549942, 0.1011902242898941, 0.10511447489261627, 0.08505205810070038, 0.10872813314199448, 0.02533550187945366, 0.06814711540937424, 0.08634378761053085]}
