{"reviews": ["Great game... I have PS3 and Vita, but have only used this for the Vita.  The game is challenging enough to keep you interested, but does not frustrate you enough to walk away.  For someone with three jobs and limited time, I like that I can pick this game up play it for 30 minutes and make good progress.", "After playing the beta and the full version for hours... I want to share my thoughts with you.First of all, I want to say that I am a huge ssb fan, I even bought a Wii just to play that game. So my expectations regarding Sony's brawler were high, thankfully the game is a sleeping beast very fun to play.STORY 7/9:The story or singleplayer campaing is the weakest feature in the game. Comparing to its competition, the singleplayer story mode will not fill your expectations, having the oportunity of making a cool and unique story mode. the developer, superbot, has created an arcade mode instead, pretty similar to tekken, but less polished. There are no animated cutscenes (expect for the 15 seconds mini cutscene between the character's rivalry), no cgi animated ending... instead the prologs and endings are static 2d art images;Although since this is a barely new franchise, its quite understandable that the game doesn't have a strong story (superbot polished the multiplayer and gameplay), perhaps further sequels will give us something better in this aspect, non the less you would expect something better coming from a first party game.PRESENTATION 9/9:Game graphics are superb. Each of the characters are very detailed and resembles perfectly, no jaggies, very good anti aliasing, light effects and shaders. The stages are also very well detailed. In this aspcet all stars does a great job. Although I'm substracting 1 point because the game menus and screens don't have the same level of quality; they do their job, they are easy to use, but there is no eye catching in them. Also, you can play ranked 2v2 matches with your buddy (he can be on his house playing online, or sitting with you on the couch playing together, although there is no multiple psn singups here :( )GAMEPLAY 10/10:Here is were the cherry in the cake is. The gameplay is superb, the game is super fun to play and the more you play the more you don't want to stop. The game mechanics are different from SSB, there is no heath bar or meter, instead the game is based on kills made by character's specials, in paper this seems to be not that fun and challenging, but is quite the opposite, there is a high level of satisfaction when you kill someone with your special power, more if it is a level 2 or 3 were you had to earn a lot of action points to fill your special bar to perform them. Actually is more satisfying than SSB in my opinion. Multiplayer plays extremelly well (no lag from day one). Each character is different to use than the other, no as generic as SSB, more like tekken where every character has its own unique fighting style.REPLAYABILITY 10/10:There are tons of content to unlock, from costums, badges, to minions. There are many customizable multiplayer modes for you to try and play with friends and the online modes are incredible. The game is so fun to play that every mode is great. The arcade mode will help as a tutorial and practice (even though these modes do exist as well). You can play this game for hours and hours and never get bored.OVERALL: 9/10This game is a must for every playstation and brawler fan. Haters gonna hat, wii users will hate it since its SSB's competition. Do a favor and play it before judging, this game may suprise you.", "\"This game was great, being able to have a smashbros-esque game on my PS3 was a major plus. Im a diehard Sly Cooper fan so of course he was my first choice and he didn't fail me. Awesome moves and combos to make any gamer happy. The \"\"supers\"\" built up by combos are awesome, of course a level 3 super is the best but they are all unique and exciting. All the characters were great. My only downside was that some of the level designs just weren't too great. I liked them, but nothing really wowed me like the fun of a smashbros level usually almost always done. Overall though, well worth the price, awesome game!\"", "This a great game to play with a couple of buddies or even one because of the online feature.  It may not be Super Smash Bros. but it is still a fun game.", "I played the demo for this game and wasn't impressed.  Was to hard getting a feel for the game when everyone online kept owning me.  I decided to pick it up because my friends kept talking highly of the game.Once you understand the battle mechanics the game is really enjoyable.  It's entertaining when you use a level 1 super and take out 3 opponents with it.  I think the game really shines with the 2 vs 2 mode.  Very fun teaming up on your opponents by distracting one and having your friend come along and use their Super on them.Cross play works very well, my roommate will be signed into the PS3 while I'm logged into the Vita, this way we both can level up and receive trophies.  My only complaint is that there are two seperate trophy sets for the Ps3 and Vita.  Just seems cheap being able to receive two plantinums from the same game.I was really disappointed with the shipping.  My game case was busted on the bottom and the disc was moving around.  Was debating to even open it incase the disc was scratched or cracked.  Luckily there were no scratches.", "Havent tried it yet, but it arrived on time and everything looks good seems to be a good game :d", "\"Ever since I first played the original PlayStation many years ago, I've always stuck with every new iteration of the system and mostly ignored the other platforms. This wasn't necessarily out of what most of you would call \"\"fanboyism\"\", but largely out of loyalty to what I deem to be a great system, as well as the fact that I have simple needs and don't require multiple systems and hundreds of different games to keep me happy...plus, I'm cheap. Still, I've dabbled in a couple of Wii games and few of them impressed me as much as the Super Smash Brothers series. In fact, I almost considered buying myself a Wii just so I could play Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which I had a blast playing alongside other people I knew. Naturally, when I saw trailers of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, a PS3 version of Super Smash Brothers, and starring many of my favorite characters from games I own, I was overjoyed. Did this game make my dreams come true when I finally played it? Well...YES! There are a couple of slight flaws (and I mean SLIGHT), but PS All-Stars did mostly live up to my expectations. This game is made up of a roster of 20 fighters/characters from some of the most popular PlayStation titles. Since they're all available from the moment you load the game, listing them will not spoil anything for anyone. First mention goes to my all time favorites: Kratos, Cole MacGrath (good and evil versions), Jak and Daxter, and Raiden. Plenty of characters from other well known franchises are included: Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Ratchet and Clank, Sir Daniel Fortesque, Nariko, Parappa the Rapper, Heihachi Mishima, Sweet Tooth, Dante (the new version= mixed feelings there), Big Daddy, Sackboy, and Colonel Radec. Finally, there are a few other characters I've never heard of, yet are apparently very popular: Fat Princess, Spike, and Toro the Cat. An impressive roster for a first entry in what could possibly (and hopefully) become a great series.Much like in the Super Smash Brothers games, all these characters control the same and their attacks are executed with the same combinations of button and joystick inputs, but the attacks themselves differ greatly between each character. Some characters like Heihachi and Raiden are almost exclusively close range fighters, others like Kratos, Jak and Daxter, and Dante are more balanced with their long range and close range attacks, and finally others like Nathan Drake and Radec favor long range combat. There's something for every type of gamer here. Special item weapons can appear randomly during matches to aid in combat, such as RPG launchers, freeze bombs, and the Spear of Destiny (from God of War II). The different arenas available to fight in are all based off of locations from the games the All-Stars fighters originate from (God of War, Infamous, Uncharted), as well as locations from other games (Resistance and Patapon). Plenty of hazards unique to each stage make things interesting and help keep you on your toes, and they also involve elements from different games interacting with one another. For example, the Columbia stage from Bioshock Infinite gets invaded by that giant doll/mech thing from Twisted Metal and it attacks the players with missiles. Also, in the Metropolis stage from Ratchet and Clank, you see Captain Qwark in the background suddenly get attacked by the Hydra from God of War, which then turns its attention on the players and attacks them a few times. One key difference between PS All-Stars and Smash Brothers are how you score kills. In this game, the fighters don't possess damage counters and there are no ring-outs, which was the only way to kill others in Smash Brothers. Instead, each character has an AP meter that slowly fills up with juice as they land hits on enemies and they fuel each characters' Super Attacks, which are the only means of killing other enemies (with the exception of one special item weapon).There are 3 levels for Super Attacks and they're all capable of killing different numbers of enemies. Level 1 Super Attacks can normally kill 1 or 2 enemies depending on how well they're timed and aimed, but they can also be dodged or avoided by keeping a certain distance from the attacker. Level 2 Super Attacks are typically more difficult to avoid (depending on the character) and can easily kill 2 or 3 enemies on average, but are still possible to avoid. Level 3 Super Attacks are very much like the Final Smashes from Smash Brothers and usually spell certain doom for anyone else on the screen. I wasn't sure if having these Super Attacks as the only way to kill enemies was going to be a smart gameplay mechanic, but it actually makes battles very exciting, especially timed ones. However, it can be annoying in one-on-one battles, especially against the computer which has a tendency to predict incoming Super Attacks. If you miss enemies with Super Attacks, you have to refill the AP meter again, which can be frustrating. One thing I was hoping for this game to have was a more interesting singleplayer campaign, one that could at least compete with the Subspace Emissary from Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Unfortunately, the singleplayer in this game follows the same formula for all 20 characters: an intro scene plays with the chosen character hearing about a gathering of powerful fighters and then setting off to take part in the tournament. After defeating the other fighters, another scene plays with the character meeting his/her \"\"rival\"\" and then they fight. Finally, the character fights the rather unimaginative and disappointing final boss, and then a final scene plays with the character reveling in his/her victory.Accomplishing this 20 times tends to get repetitive, but luckily the scenes for all characters are done well and include most of the voice actors from the original source materials (hearing Kratos, Raiden, and Cole voiced by their original voice actors instead of some second rate understudies was a true pleasure). Also, some of the rivalries between certain characters were pretty cool. They ranged from interesting (Kratos v.s. Sweet Tooth), to appropriate fan-service (Jak and Daxter v.s. Ratchet and Clank), to hilariously bizarre (Evil Cole v.s. Fat Princess). Despite the okay singleplayer, PlayStation All-Stars still succeeds due to its multiplayer, which much like Smash Brothers, is truly the game's main focus. No need to get into too much detail here: up to 4 players can beat the crap out of each other in timed or stock matches and choose the frequency in which item weapons can appear onscreen, if any. Matches can be ranked or unranked, and you can either team up with friends or do free-for-all matches. Online matches tend to freeze at times, but what online games don't these days? I'm still rather new to the multiplayer and I've mostly had my rear handed to me by much more skilled players, but in time my skills will improve and I'm sure I will enjoy the game even more when I start winning matches more often. Also, for those of you who are interested, the more you play with a particular character (online or offline), the more extras you unlock like costumes, taunts, victory music, and so on. PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale is certainly a fun game, but know that the best experience will be the multiplayer, so don't expect the singleplayer to satisfy you on its own if that's all you're interested in. Still, if you're like me and don't want to invest in another system just to have the Smash Brothers experience, then get this game, it's a very worthy alternative. If a sequel is made, let's hope other true PlayStation All-Stars like Solid Snake and Crash Bandicoot get added into the mix.\"", "If your into multiplayer games that are easy to play and deliver countless hours of fun, this is your game. Built on the basis of  Super Smash Brothers, this game offers most of your favorite playstation stars to command through an ultimate lowdown brawl.", "\"I'm going to make a few comparisons to Smash in this review, but it's important to understand that these are two fundamentally different series. Smash is about momentum and positioning, All-Stars is about combos and Supers. On the surface they look similar, but if you go into All-Stars thinking it'll be like Smash you'll end up either very disappointed or very satisfied(depending on your perspective). If you're reading this review, I assume that you at least have a basic understanding of All-Stars' gameplay mechanics. Now, on to the review.All-Stars. Is. Awesome. It has a ton of single-player content and could easily take up hundreds of hours of your time in multiplayer mode. The game's getting free-to-early-adopter DLC characters(like Kat from Gravity Rush), maps and game modes soon and the production values are very high, with a level of polish you'd expect from a major first-party PS3 release. The thing I'm probably most excited about overall with the game is its crossbuy/crossplay functionality- you buy the PS3 version and you get a download copy of the Vita version free. I can confirm that the Vita version is just as good as the PS3 one, with a slightly different menu interface optimized for the Vita's smaller screen; however, I did notice some performance issues when things got really, really intense on the level Sandover Village(a mix of Jak & Daxter and Hot Shots Golf). I tested each and every level on PS3 and Vita simultaneously and that was the only level to give me performance issues. Otherwise it's a steady 60 FPS in both versions, the content's all the same(with compressed textures and obviously a lower resolution on the Vita).The visuals are great, I purchased the game thinking it was 1080p(60 frames-per-second on the Vita and PS3 versions) but it's only listed as 1080i on the back of the box; still looks like 1080p on my HDTV and my friend's high-end LG Smart TV, so it's all good. Most of the character animations feel like they were taken straight from the characters' respective 3D games and modified to fit the 2D perspective of the title, with the notable exception of pretty much Parappa's entire moveset.The music is surprisingly very exceptional, I went into the game expecting boring music compared to the Nintendo stuff I grew up with in Smash but am just as impressed as with Brawl's lovely soundtrack. I especially love the way even the music is a mash-up of two franchises, this is a true cross-franchise game designed with that in mind from the start. Some of the new techno-y songs created for the game are nice, not quite as \"\"epic\"\" as Nobuo Uematsu's music from the intro to Brawl but still very catchy. The maps are also awesome, with my two favorites being Franzea(a mix of LocoRoco and Metal Gear) and Black Rock Stadium(a mix of Twisted Metal and Jak 2). Each map is a visually stunning combination of two classic Playstation franchises, you can turn off stage hazards and the only maps I dislike still have their uses(like the boring, platform-less Dojo map being great for learning how characters work and extremely simple fights). You wouldn't believe just how charming it is to see Hades(from the level, uh, Hades) taken down by a tribe of invading Patapon after he spends a few minutes reigning terror down on the players. This is another thing I kinda wish Nintendo would steal from this game, crossing over maps and music between multiple franchises. Unlikely, but eh, Nintendo could certainly learn a lot from All-Stars. It goes both ways.The characters play extremely differently, with no two Smash characters playing as differently as the two most similar All-Stars characters.  The Supers system is a great change of pace from the norm, unlike anything else I've ever experienced in any other fighting game- it can be very satisfying to have to endure level 1 and level 2 super attacks for a few minutes while you're waiting for your level 3 super, just to unleash your level 3 on your enemies and get five or six kills. It's also satisfying to just use your supers whenever you feel like it, the super system feels great either way. A few supers are similar(like Sly Cooper's and Fat Princess' level 1 attacks), but they're all different enough so that they aren't just straight copies: to compare the two previously referenced supers, Sly summons Murray to attack everyone in front of him while he stays stationary and Fat Princess herself takes down the people standing between her and the piece of cake summoned about a yard ahead of her. Very similar, but the characters' positioning after the attacks is certainly key. Some characters' supers are easier to charge(with AP that you get from attacking opponents), but they're generally less effective. This leads to great balancing, with Parappa's no-range level 1 being much easier to charge than Dante's or Ratchet's longer-range attacks. Either way, it's a satisfying system that deserves praise.I'd recommend you play through all the campaigns to get a feel for all the characters, by then you'll most likely have figured out your \"\"mains,\"\" the characters you generally play as. After about ten hours of testing the waters I settled on Ratchet as my main, Spike as my secondary and Sir Dan as my tertiary; you can become proficient with all the characters with enough practice, but I can tell very easily that it's near-impossible to master each and every single character. All-Stars isn't quite as easy to jump in and master as Smash, but that extra complexity could(likely WILL) lead to All-Stars having much better longevity than a Smash entry, even with half as many characters. Most people would recommend that you stick with one character and just try to master them, but I'd recommend you at least have a basic understanding of each character's supers and playstyles if you wanna dominate them. The balancing in the game is great, so you could potentially select any of the game's 20+ characters and just enjoy the title with them; that said, Kratos does feel a little OP and many Radec players like to spam their sniper rifle move obnoxiously, leading to either you try to focus on THEM in frustration while the other players constantly catch you off-guard, orrr take the beating and suck it up. Matches with multiple Kratos players or Radecs(worse yet, two Kratos and one Radec) can be very frustrating, but it's already been confirmed that Kratos will be nerfed next; Radec isn't OP, his playstyle is just a little annoying to fight against in groups.Overall, I can't think of a game more deserving of my dollar vote than All-Stars. The production values are great, it's the start of a promising new IP, the game design is top-notch and it comes with a free download copy of the Vita version. One big downside of the game is its inclusion of an online pass system, a form of DRM that blocks players who don't own a new copy of the game(or people who had the game loaned to them) from accessing the online tournament mode. Sure, I want the developers to make money off each sale but DRM is the reason I quit PC gaming and reverted to console gaming- I don't want my consumer rights curbed even a little under any circumstances, especially when the only used games I purchase are out-of-print titles with extremely marked-up prices. Still, at the end of the day this is one of the best fighting games of the past console generation and I can't recommend it enough.\"", "this is the sony version of super smash. though still not as fun nor as huge as SS spc when u need to pay for the extra 4 downloadable characters for each single character!! what a rip off!!", "It is a (in my opinion) slightly better version of Super Smash Bros. The Nintendo series just couldn't keep up with this one. The major differences are the deaths only occur when specials are used (you have to look on youtube to understand) and items aren't as frequent. Still a great game.", "I bought this because I was having a get together and we were going to play games and eat pizza,  this game was the star of the night lets just say it was not switched out all night , fun for a group of friends coming over and battleting out . Were all mature so Nintendo does nothing for us anymore so this is a great replacement for smash brothers .", "This game was a good one fun without being to repetitive at the same time. Overall I will give the game 4 of of 5 only because they show you the dlc on the CPU characters that u can get unlock in the game normally. Other that the game is good.", "\"I, like many of you, when first heard about this game, inmediately thought \"\"Mash Bros\"\", and so I had my doubts. And honestly speaking, the main reason I pre-ordered the game was the free Vita version...but all my doubts are now put to rest, this is a game that deserves a 5 star rating and well deserved.For starters, the game comes with a great roster, which includes:KratosParappaFat PrincessSweet ToothRadecSly CooperNathan DrakeHeihachiDanteBig DaddyJakRatchetNarikoColeEvil ColeRaidenSack BoySir DanielSpikeToroThe game comes with different modes that include, Solo Play, Tournament, Versus Match and character customization and extras. Stages are fully active, they come packed with hazards, items and explosions, some of which can really hurt you and your oponents. Each character has 3 stages of \"\"special moves\"\" which can be used, once the special move meter is full. Once full, you simply press the R2 button and the character will engage his/her special move. Each special move stage has its unique set of skills and will vary in power, 3 being the strongest of course.Graphics:Very sharp and bright with plenty of interactive arenas. Each stage/arena belongs to each of the characters game locations, for example, a flying cargo plane (Drake), God Of War, etc. Each level has been carefully detailed and playing is not only fun, but there's eye candy and plenty of it. Each character has also been done with great attention to detail, from sack boy to sly cooper to Raiden, all look well done. Explosions and other effects look great and will not disappoint.Sound:Again, each stage has sounds from each franchise. I personally like Uncharted's classic orchestra style and God Of War's dramatic score. Character voices are original and their sound effects, from weapons to special moves, sound great; even during heavy battles, you'll be able to hear each effect, music and other stage related sounds with detail and plenty of punch.Performance:I was afraid to run into frame rate issues, but thankfully, this isn't the case. Even with a full roster on screen at once, the game perfornmed impecably. There was no lag during online play or choppiness during local and single play. I tested the game with a full roster on a stage with plenty of action, such as background effects and incoming hazards; the game did not skip a beat.Multiplayer:Simply put. FUN with NO LAG. Both local and online, the MP section is flawless, connections are easily stablished and maintain a lag free performance. Up to 4 players at once, both off/on line. At first, each fight will seem a bit chaotic, but once you learn the basics, each fight will become more interesting, as you will be thinking of ways to fill up your special move meter or simply finding ways to hurt your oponents with style ;)Cross Play Multiplayer:I tested it and have not complaints. I was able to battle against PS Vita/PS3 opponents without any issues. Connections are smooth and easy to stablish. I noticed both systems were in perfect sync, each fighter's move translated into an accurate action on the screen, it was 100% real time action. More about cross play below****Controls:Easy to pick up and learn. You'll be given the option to play a \"\"tutorial\"\" the first time (one time only) you start the game and even though the game is extremely easy to play, I recommend playing the tutorial, so you can familiarize yourself with each button. Pulling combos will take some practice, but are easily done once you get the hang of it. I have no complaints about the controls and neither will you.In conclusion, if you're still on the fence about this game, let me put your mind at ease and tell you that this game delivers, it is FUN to play, specially with other players, the more the better; you will probably spend a lot of time on this game off and online and its replay value is extremely high. A great party game that can acomodate those whom just want a quick, fun fighting game and those whom like more technical fighting, such as combos, etc. No matter what your aproach is, this game is without a doubt, a great start for the series.********************************************************************************************************************VITA GAME DOWNLOAD:PS Vita Code: THE FREE VITA GAME CAN ONLY BE LINKED TO ONE PS3 DISC ACCOUNT. THERE'S NOT CODE TO ENTER OR GIVE AWAY.The game includes a free copy of the Vita version, but it doesn't come with a code nor will it give you one, here's what you do:Insert disc into your PS3Navigate to the game menu on your PS3 dashboard.There you will see 3 disc icons for the game.Select the second icon for \"\"disc benefits\"\"You will be taken to the sub menuChoose the cross buy option.Once you've done that, you will be taken to the PSN store, where you will add the vita version into your cart. The price will be $0.

Remote play connects YOUR vita to YOUR PS3 to be able to navigate and play game discs on your PS3 from your Vita (not all discs work). Anyway, Cross Play works by sending friends \"\"game invitations\"\", but there has to be a copy of the game on each system (PS3 & Vita), here's how:From PS3:- Versus Mode-Press R2, Invite Friends.-Select the friend whom is playing on his Vita-A message will pop up on your friend's Vita showing your gaming invite-Once he accepts, he will then apear on as player 2.-You're done! Battle and enjoy.From PS Vita:-Versus Mode-WiFi-Make sure you're connected to PSN by touching the upper right hand corner, you'll be taken to a sub menu, there you will either see \"\"sign in\"\" (connect if you do) or view invites/invite friends.-Select \"\"Invite\"\" and your friends list will apear, select him/her-PS3 player will get an invite message-Once they accept, you can battle together.FINAL NOTE ABOUT CROSS PLAY....I'm sure you want to give this a try right away, with your own Vita, don't worry, it's actually quite simple, create another PSN account for yourself, but remember that you will need another email address....to avoid confusion and headaches when creating another PSN acount, simply add a number to your actual PSN account when creating the extra one...example, your current PSN account is \"\"PLAYER\"\" make the new account \"\"PLAYER2\"\"Hope this helps.\"", "All i can say is that this is a game where you'd want to drag your friends to come play with you and have fun with. Also this game is suitable for all ages, it covers a lot of different genres through the stages, you can literally tell that sony put a lot of effort into this. on the downside the character roster is a bit lacking compared to tekken tag tournament 2, but i can't complain because i heard dlc will be coming for this game. also i don't want to sound like a crash bandicoot fanboy, but where is he? sony is like pulling a megaman right here, and totally abandoning him. OK now back to the game, well you got many to do but you will be diving into the arcade and multiplayer instantly, as for the arcade Its just plain simple arcade to me, multiplayer is fun but my complaint for those two are that sometimes the game screen zoom out to see all 4 players and it sometimes confuses you as to where you are. anyway this game is great, deserves to be a day 1 purchase and is worth the 60 dollar price tag.", "I purchased this to see how Sony could compete with Nintendo's Super Smash Bros'.  It's a fun game, but considering you have to use 'super' attacks to KO players, it makes for some weird brawler gameplay.  It does have cross-buy though and I would think would be a much better Vita game, so if you've got a Vita this has a lot more value for you.", "Different from Smash Bros. to say the least.  But worth it for the online experience alone.  If you like Smash Bros. and you like Sony properties, then you will love this game.  Great value if you have a Vita as well for the Cross-buy.", "What a pleasant surprise! PlayStation All-stars is really, extremely fun! Especially with other, real life players. The controls are fairly easy to understand and once you get the hang of it, the real game begins~! I bought the game brand new so I also got a free copy of the PS Vita version. That's two games for the price one.", "This game is smash brothers for the PS3.  Its that simple, and i'm not complaining, as I loved smash brothers, sooo....i don't really see the problem :)  Saves me from having to find a used Wii anytime soon.  But I almost wish, if you were going to copy the idea from smash, why didn't you just copy the whole thing?  No replays are in the game, which sucks.  One of the most enjoyable parts of smash brothers was awesome replays that you could even edit, take pictures of, and send to your friends.  Also, no level creator liket he last smash, which was another fun part of smash.  So taking that into account, and the game itself, its just fun.  Raiden feels like Fox mcCloud, Nate is this games's Snake.  Just fun with 2 or 3 friends, no other way to explain it.", "\"This is a DIFFERENT game than Super Smash Bros. It is not a clone, but definitely draws from the original idea.First, the biggest WOW factor\"\" for me is the cross-play/cross-buy between the Vita and PS3 version. This is an idea that is fantastic. Not only is the value of the purchase significant, but the whole idea is something I've been waiting for awhile now.The character roster is doable. It is not going to satisfy everyone. You will always have those \"\"where is this character?\"\" and \"\"why didn't they include this character?\"\" people, but the amount of playable characters is sufficient for a first go-around. The characters feel like you took them directly out of their original games and put them into the battle arena. What I mean is that they characters actually feel like they do in their own games, which is something I can't say for Super Smash Bros.The story mode is lazy with really no substance. It's the biggest detractor. They had a huge opportunity to blow any Super Smash comparisons out of the water with a superb single player story, but entered the same pitfall and ended up actually considerably worse than its prime competitor.The unlockables are great, but still not as solid as Super Smash. I had spent many hours with SSB Brawl that had more meaningful and varied unlockables. The games biggest gameplay difference is the Special Gauge. Once this meter fills up, you perform your special which is the only way to get kills. This style will grow on you, but it makes character selection more heavy on their specials than the normal combat moves. The game seems to focus on online play, which is definitely fine by me. It's fun and connection is pretty seamless.Overall, I'd definitely recommend it. (At it's current price of $40, it is a must buy)\"", "I wasn't very interested in this game at first but it came free with my PS Vita, I have to say it exceeded all my expectations. Apart from the menus, everything in this game is really well done: Graphics, character, character moves are very unique. Critics will compare it to Smash Bros and say it's not as fun or whatever. All I have to say is that I haven't had this much fun with my friends and family for a long time. Definitely worth it if you like fighting games.", "Sony got a lil bit over half of the playable characters right but some of the smaller characters should of been DLC. A game like this would of sold millions if it had all the big dogs like Snake, Scorpion, Hades, Ryu,etc. but yeah i know sony doesn't have the cash or the other companies doesn't want sony to have a big hit game on their hands.....Other than that the game levels are set up good, you go through about 8 levels i think the first 4 are like 3 mins rounds. then its kill 3 guys and you win the round after that...the boss is kinda meh but not a issue. thing i hate is how it takes like 30 mins to complete a game, well i dunno that's not all that long but a game like this you tend to pause and take breaks because it's just not a game where you will stay focus long enough to play a complete game then start over with another character, it just needs more tweaks in each level to expand that replay value.", "I just can't get into this game. I tried. The fighting and combos are somewhat different to this game, but I am still offered the repetitiveness of any other fighting game. Everything os pretty much the same. Some levels are more dynamic than others, but other than that, they still move in the same motion. I used to play a lot of fighting games like Dead or Alive, but I can't seem to get into this one. I might pick up the controller for a match here or there, but I find myself playing any other game, but this one. I only paid $29.99 for it. It was that price at Target and Bestbuy about a month ago.I must say, it is cool like the old super smash bros series, but still lacks something. The ability to play on vita and PS3 was a nice touch. The super finisher move ability seemed a little silly. You get a super power that is like a 1 hit knock out depending on how full your meter is. It was nice to see the originality in the design of the finisher moves, but ultimately I felt like it was too easy and it left me wanting more.I give it 3 stars based upon my impression. I would give it 5 if it were more entertaining and had an added depth to it. I still rather pick up any old game instead of this one.", "\"As the world not-so-patiently waits for the next installment of Super Smash Bros., we're treated to PlayStation All-Stars, a game that was undeniably inspired by the now-iconic brawler that came before it, yet plays differently enough to make a mark all its own. The premise is very similar to SSB: the most memorable icons of the various Sony-owned franchises are cobbled together in a crossover fighting game in which the goal is to knock the stuffing out of your opponents. Like Smash, All-Stars offers various modes with a predominant focus on multiplayer madness, and does a decent job of highlighting its roster's own respective characters and the worlds they inhabit. Although it's unlikely to become as iconic of a series as Smash, at least as it is now, it introduces some compelling gameplay mechanics and hearty fun to the table that certainly earns it a worthwhile spot in most gamers' catalogues.The key trait that differentiates All-Stars from Smash is that instead of trying to knock your opponent off the screen, your key focus will be building enough meter to initiate super attacks that kill your foes. This meter, or AP, as it is called, is progressively earned throughout each match as you successfully land basic attacks; you can earn more AP by landing long strings of attacks and combos, and will then spend the AP on Super Moves, the only way you can actually defeat opponents. Like Marvel VS. Capcom, there are different levels of Super Moves, with each being more powerful than the last; Level 1 Super Moves are generally quick and must be properly timed in order to achieve many kills, as where Level 3 (the maximum) Supers are highly destructive ultra-attacks that oftentimes allow you to kill just about everyone on screen (sometimes more than once).You'll be able to choose from a roster of 20 characters (not including the DLC to come), all available from the get-go (there are no hidden characters). These include most of PlayStation's most well-known faces, whether it be Ratchet and Clank, Kratos from God of War, Sly Cooper, Nathan Drake of Uncharted, or LittleBigPlanet's adorable mascot Sackboy. There's also some third party love in the form of Devil May Cry's Dante (in his more recent DMC form), Metal Gear Solid's Raiden and even BioShock's Big Daddy. Some may bemoan the absence of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the dragon, but I'm willing to bet there were simply some licensing issues given that neither of these characters are technically owned by Sony. Overall there's a nice amount of diversity, particularly given that aside from the good and evil forms of Cole McGrath, no two characters play alike. One element the game fails to achieve is aesthetic cohesiveness; as where Smash's design makes it believable that Mario and Samus Aran could inhabit the same universe, there's something very scattered about All-Stars' visual style. There are jarring differences in the way characters like the comical Fat Princess are textured and animated as opposed to the sketchy Toro or highly realistic Nariko. Although they are obviously each from vastly different franchises sporting different designs, it would have been nice if more were done to help everything \"\"belong,\"\" since it ends up looking like each of these characters were simply cherry-picked from their respective games and slopped together onscreen (to clarify, I'm not saying Nariko should be cartoonish like Toro, I'm just saying it would be nice if there were any actual cohesiveness to the designs). Although disproportionately overpowered characters exist in most fighting games, All-Stars is actually mostly pretty balanced, as it's quite possible to win or lose with just about any given character. The brashly glaring exception is Kratos, whose soul-crushing Level 3 Super, ridiculously rapid AP gain and obnoxiously auto-aiming grappling attacks are all in desperate need of nerfing. Although he's certainly not impossible to defeat, expect to see him repeatedly-and frustratingly-in online runs.This thankfully doesn't much affect the actual gameplay, which in and of itself is a blast, particularly the multiplayer. All the expected play modes are here: you can start a versus match with friends you're physically with or hop online for some multiplayer madness with players across the nation (I'm unsure how far the servers span exactly or if it's actually worldwide, because I've played hundreds of online matches and have yet to see any noticeably foreign users), or go it alone against CPUs by practicing new moves in Training Mode or running through a single-player campaign. As with most fighting games nowadays, the single-player mode here is pretty basic and lacks imagination. You'll play through a series of random battles against CPU opponents leading up to a brief cutscene which differs depending on the character you're playing (the only actual instance of character-specific individuality) in which they face off against a predetermined opponent, presumably pegged as that character's \"\"anti.\"\" Although hosting a battle between Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank makes sense, you'll probably have a harder time deciphering what Sackboy and Big Daddy have against each other. Following this is a boss fight (which is identical regardless of your character), which-without \"\"spoiling\"\" anything-I'll say is blatantly \"\"inspired\"\" by Super Smash Bros.' Master Hand.The motivation to play through the single-player campaign is a bit sparse, given there are no hidden characters or major unlockables. However, the more you use a specific character, whether it be in multiplayer, online or otherwise, you will progressively increase their rank. As a character's rank increases, you'll earn access to various unlockable goodies for him or her. This includes new costumes and skins, different opening/winning animations, new taunts, user icons themed after their respective games, and more. This is a great feature and offers something of a reward for repeat use of specific characters; it's nice to be able to strut your fanboy pride in online matches through these various aesthetic perks, and also offers appreciable customization options that far too many brawlers lack.The game's online mode is where it really, truly shines and one instance in which Smash should in fact be the one taking notes. You can instantly hop on the PlayStation Network to duke it out against random opponents in either competitive ranked matches or pressure-free quick matches, both of which can be adjusted with customizable settings or rules. Whether you want to fight three random opponents in a free-for-all, go up against a group of friends in different states, or team up with a friend and battle two opponents together, there are easy options to instantly do so. These matches are almost entirely seamless and lag-free, and it's incredibly simple to invite friends, join groups or drop out when you're done. This is where the replay factor lies and what is done here is done extremely well. The only issue is a recent one-the game underwent a recent patch in which some initial issues were resolved and a character was nerfed; following this update, the game now suffers sporadic glitches, some of which are more severe than others. On occasion, Super Moves may randomly fail, you may be routinely disconnected from friends you're trying to play with, and at its worst characters will suddenly glitch and appear at random different spots onscreen. The issue isn't consistent enough to ruin the experience, but I'm sincerely hoping another patch to repair this shoddy one is well on its way.Among the game's most notable setbacks are the deeply bizarre stage designs. Although each one clearly meant well, featuring inventive blends of not one but two separate Sony franchises (\"\"Invasion,\"\" for example, borrows aesthetics of both Ape Escape and Killzone), most of them are poorly designed and don't bode well for hosting actual combat. For one, most of the stages are flat out too large and sport about three to four too many stage hazards, some of which are difficult to predict. With scattered clusters of moving platforms and environments that change too many times throughout a match, keeping the focus on the fighting becomes increasingly difficult as you become more concerned about fleeing from hazards (some of which render you immobile for several seconds or drain devastating amounts of hard-earned AP), which can too often make for cheap, random disadvantages. The game's fidgety camera does nothing to help-unlike Smash, the camera isn't predominantly fixed, and instead zooms in and out repeatedly depending on where everyone is. In the chaos of so many hazards and doodads in an enormous environment with multiple opponents, it's not hard to routinely lose track of yourself, particularly if you're playing a small (or, in the case of Sly Cooper, invisible) character. The sheer size of these stages also give projectile-wielding characters disproportionate advantages, or at least far too many opportunities to stand in a corner and troll. Although there are options to turn the hazards off, I'm unsure if this is an option in all modes, and even without the hazards it's difficult to land kills when your opponent is yards away or tucked between hordes of moving platforms or random giant structures. This opinion may not be shared by all players necessarily, but I'm not one for so heavily shifting the focus from the actual fighting and allowing too many opportunities to flee or troll.As nasty as some of these problems sound, none of it can put the sheer fun to a halt. Like the best fighting games, PlayStation All-Stars is all-around addictive, and it's easy to spend hours upon hours duking it out with buddies (or whoever else, of course). The tactical aspect of building your own AP with expertly executed combos while keeping track of your opponent's (and when they're likely to use their Supers) amps the excitement every match, and gives some nice depth to what may have ordinarily been a rehash-y concept. Although it's certainly possible for newbies to pick-up-and-play, All-Stars is a game you must spend time with before truly understanding, but thanks to its diverse cast of characters and array of quirky features and visuals, it will be time well spent. It might not be Smash-and it doesn't have to be-but it certainly gives Smash fans something great to enjoy during the wait. Whether you're a longtime Sony fan or just getting into the action, PlayStation All-Stars is a celebration of some great franchises that offers some truly riveting brawling.\"", "I went into this game with high hopes, but basically low expectations (what does that even mean?).I expected this game to be similar to Ninja Turtles Smash Up (which most havent played or heard of... which is a good thing), which was a game that tried to mimic the Smash Bros Franchise.Then I saw the first game trailers, and although it contained the parts of Sony I was quite fond of, I was still very iffy about this game working.Although I couldn't just pick it up and start playing (there is a learning curve), once I got the hang of it, I definitely didn't want to put it down. This game did one thing that Smash Bro's couldn't. That was introduce an online multiplayer mode... THAT WORKS! (if you've ever played Super Smash Bro's Brawl online, you understand what I mean).ProsWell Balanced and Fun.Online mode not only works, but works well. (so far only had one game DC on me, and in another game, it changed my character once it entered the match)Done Right!Great/Interesting Roster. Each character feels unique, while fitting into the game quite well. Each with their own tactics and play style, offering a variety of different game play.A number of good and interesting stages.Possible incoming patches/DLC! (I'm hoping for more than costumes, emblems, and avatarts... I'm hoping new character/stages/balance issues)ConsThis game isnt perfect. As I mentioned before, there is a bit of learning that needs to be done for each character and items to really get an understanding of the game. If you just walk in, pick up a controller, you probably are not going to have a great experience, but the game DOES HAVE a button masher quality to it which allows for decent game play without full understanding. Each character has a wide variety of moves and tactis to learnAdventure mode is slightly lacking, but thats not a bad thing, just doesnt add to replay value, which is mostly in the multiplayer mode.Each characters move list is a lil much (although simplified enough to make it accessible to all). Some moves seem pointless, or just like a 'meh' move, just added to fill in space, while others seem overwhelming. But this game is still very well balanced considering.I feel like the stages get old very quickly, or they seem very routine at some point. Others seem forced together (two different stages from two different games merges in a way that doesnt really work).I'd give this game an 8.5", "Forget all the other fighting games out there. This game rocks!!!!! Its waaaaay better than that Nintendo brawl fighting game. Better graphics and better action. More unique character from many universes and not just characters from sony playstation. This is a great game to play either by yourself or with a bunch of family and friends. Trust me and go ahead and buy it! 39.99 is a steal!", "I hate to write long reviews so all I'm gonna say is that I Love this game :)If you like fighting games or a Sony fan, buy this now!", "Is a good game, the only bad thing is than the characters of the game are poor in quanties. Is PERFECT when you are with friends, but alone is a little boring...Super smash bros is so much better.... As well is a nice try of Sony.", "I like fighting games but I never got into Smash Bros cause it was too cutesy & well i was playing other more hardcore games w guns & all dat... but i always heard the best about it.This is Sony's take on that Smash type game.So I bought this for my PS3 & WOW!!!though the Sony mascots & characters aren't as appealing to me as say Nintendo characters,& because x360 is really my main console, for example i only cared for Parappa & Kratos & Ratchet, there are many characters & they play very different.& have many many moves.I had to get this because of Raiden from Metal Gear Rising.I didn't even know it had Dante or Heihachi in it.Then to top it all of,  you have can get Issac from Dead Space series !!!!(he's DLC)So throw Kratos into the mix & it's MADNESS!what other game puts Konami(Raiden)vsCapcom(DmC)(i prefer classic)vs Namco (Heihachi)?only in our dreams until NOWMe & my friends & cousins just pummel each other!!!it always starts with laughter then when its up to the last 2 people it gets really intense LOL& one Super taking out 3 others at once, NICE!!!those level 3's are very cool.the Killzone map is my favorite. has good music.the maps morph into other characters' maps.I would have given this game 5 stars if it had more KNOWN CLASSIC characters.hopefully this game gets a sequel with even more characters.OVERALLYES !!! Get this. it's cheap & it comes with a digital copy for the Vita thru Cross Buy.(so if you ever decide to get a Vita, you have it already & it shares data with the PS3 version)if you have a PS3 this is a MUST HAVE!!!", "I held off on this game because the price seemed too high for what it was. The bigger issue was that I participated in the beta, and I had a terrible time trying to keep track of which character on screen was mine. There just wasn't enough to distinguish which player I was controlling. But the premise of the game was appealing. So when the price dropped I went ahead with it. I must say, it's a pretty fun game. I still have a bit of trouble keeping track of which character is mine, but they improved that a little bit. Recommended for fans of Super Smash Bros Brawl and the like.", "this game is funny and stimulating. I say it is a must grab because all of the famous action characters are doing all kinds of silly stupid stuff and if you like to be entertained as well as become skillful you'll enjoy Battle Royale.", "\"Smash Bros is one of my favorite Nintendo franchises.  So when I heard Sony was doing their own take on it, I was pretty excited.  After days of playing I can say that the similarities between the two are pretty much all on the outside.  Yes, it LOOKS a lot like Smash Bros, but plays nothing like it.  The core mechanics and strategies you need to use are worlds apart.  PS All-Stars is a completely different beast all together.I've had a great time playing through each character's story and experimenting with their fighting style.  A lot of people will find comfort with Kratos because he's so powerful and easy to use.  But I'm personally using Ratchet and Spike a lot.  Multiplayer is where a lot of people will be spending most of their time and I'm happy to report it works without a hitch.  Matches load quickly and there's no lag to speak of.  Although, on rare occasions, I will be assigned to a different character then I actually picked.  Hopefully a patch will fix this.My main complaint is that the Arcade/story mode is completely narrated by still pictures with voice overs.  Except your \"\"rival fight\"\" just before the boss battle...which is over pretty quickly.  It would of been epic if each character had a live action scene.  Or if they did like Mortal Kombat and had a story where you play through as each character.  The way it is seems lazy, but the core fighting is just so much fun I'm still giving it a 5/5.PlayStation fans and fighting game fans have no excuse not to pick this up.  It's a complete blast to play.\""], "A": [0.07988239079713821, 0.002444751560688019, 0.02495587430894375, 0.03752174228429794, 0.004718333017081022, 0.02307373844087124, 1.9035439891013084e-09, 0.08087556809186935, 3.4247414077981375e-06, 0.08358197659254074, 0.04926837608218193, 0.06517980992794037, 0.08475571125745773, 2.4833030693116598e-05, 2.790532019868175e-13, 0.016686461865901947, 0.01433892734348774, 0.0040591624565422535, 0.00012367466115392745, 0.002644092310220003, 0.06709450483322144, 0.002323542023077607, 0.010886359959840775, 0.02557007409632206, 0.012184830382466316, 0.04145483672618866, 0.08581027388572693, 0.06954681873321533, 0.013921045698225498, 0.015127120539546013, 0.022819943726062775, 0.059121839702129364]}
