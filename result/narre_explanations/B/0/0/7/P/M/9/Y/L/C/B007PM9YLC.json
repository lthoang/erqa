{"reviews": ["This is a very nice, relatively light coffee. The flavor is a bit rich without any bitterness. If you're looking for a strong, dark roast, you won't find it here. But if you want something on the mild side but still flavorful, you've got it.Note that most of the poor reviews of this seem to be for a different product, as they refer to some kind of dark-roast whole-bean package. Some kind of technical mixup, I guess.", "Anything grown in Hawaii's rich volcanic soil is going to be amazing. And that has been proven with all the many foodstuffs produced there. Think about it... the whole island chain is volcanos which has risen up from the ocean floor!Buy this coffee and support Hawaii. And I vehemently urge you to go visit, both United and Hawaiian Air have very good fares throughout the year. You rich folks can rent beautiful homes by the ocean but even those without much $$ to spend can stay at The Polynesian Plaza for less than $100 a night and its a block away from the beach! Please go, you'll love it.", "This was some delicious coffee, but given where it's from that isn't at all surprising. It was a very nice medium roast, lacking the bite of darker roasts and offering a smooth and pleasant flavor. Honestly, the only reason I'm rating it a 4 is that all but one of my K-Cups leaked out of the top during brewing.I've had K-Cups from several other companies that use the same plasticless design and never once had an issue with coffee seeping up through the hole made in the top of the cup. Hopefully it was just a bum batch in that regard, but even if that just how their K-Cups work, this coffee is still worth buying, especially if you don't mind a little bit of clean-up afterward.", "These little coffee pods are packed full of flavor.  The flavor is strong, yet smooth and it doesn't leave a burnt taste in your mouth, like some Starbucks coffees do.  I prefer the medium roast flavors, and this one lived up to its name.The box comes with a foil bag in it.  The pods need to remain in the box, because they need to be sealed in that bag.  The bottom of these are mesh as opposed to plastic, so they can lose their flavor or go stale if exposed to air for too long.  You won't be able to put these in your K-Cup displays.  The lack of plastic, however, cuts down on the waste which is better for the environment.I like these!  If you are looking for a nice coffee, with a smooth taste, give these a try!", "Not only is this a good, smooth cup of coffee with very little bitter aftertaste but it also is less wasteful as it doesn't have a full plastic cup.  The bottom instead of having plastic is just the filter.  A tip is to store these in an airtight container after opening to keep freshness for every cup if you are picky about staleness.  Overall I was very pleasantly surprised by this coffee!", "At first, I thought this coffee tasted rather strange.  It is grown in fields fertilized by lava, so I'm not sure if that made a difference or not.  Anyway, I kept on drinking these and well, now I really like it.  So much so that I can't wait to come down in the morning and grab a cup.  It's very smooth, rich and doesn't have that nasty burned aftertaste.  It also comes in pods that have the filter exposed, so they are stored inside the box in a foil package to keep them fresh.  I LOVE opening that foil package and smelling the fresh coffee - I miss that with the Keurig cups.  Only this brand and Melitta that I have found so far are doing this with the fresh coffee thing.  I don't really like having these bulky boxes to store though - I have mine in a Longaberger basket and it's much more condensed than having stacks of boxes in my pantry.Just a great new product, glad I got to try it.  HIGHLY recommend!", "It appears that reviews for different flavors and types of packaging are all lumped together, so I thought I'd start by announcing which product I had.This product worked GREAT in my K-Cup  machine, and it made an excellent cup of coffee.  I experimented a little bit with size, and making an 8 oz cup was definitely a bit stronger than a 12 oz cup, but barely.I also tried brewing a second cup of coffee.  I know, I know, you aren't supposed to do that.  But I know so many folks do, so I thought I'd test it out.  I made a 10 oz cup first (perfect!) and then an 8 oz cup.  The color was still pretty dark, but certainly not as dark as the first cup).  But it definitely tasted pretty weak.All in all, a very nice cup of coffee.", "I don't know all the buzzwords that coffee fans use; I'm never sure if my coffee is &#34;bold&#34; or not.  Decaf is about as technical as I get.  But I really liked this coffee and I thought it had good flavor.  I always have to add a little coffee mate and some sun crystals (a Stevia/sugar combo) because I don't like black, sugar-free coffee and this coffee was really good with those.  I don't drink much coffee with caffeine, because it really bothers me, but I drank this and enjoyed it.  Unlike most of the coffee pods, this one doesn't have plastic pods, it has a kind of mesh weave which lets the water in and the coffee out.  I don't know how tell you what makes it different, but it is good coffee.", "I have never tried Kauai coffee, just thought of it as too expensive, while about 10-15 cents more per cup than Keurig's Green Mountain, not bad.  Also only used a portion pack with one other brand.  The coffee comes in a air-tight aluminum foil bag held closed with a bendable strip (a zip lock bag would make my life easier, if you do this Kauai please send me a royalty check).  Mellow smell when you open the bag.No trouble or issues with the portion pack (they do drip as you are carrying them to the wastebasket, unlike a k-cup).  Nice  brewed smell.  The taste is very mild, good coffee for later in the day, not what you'd want for that wake-up blast in the morning.  I tried this as iced coffee once and it was very good!  Didn't have a bitter flavor.One issue:  I have a k-cup holder to store cups and you can't use it for these as they should be kept in air-tight  pouch since they are mesh and not air-tight.  Really makes storage an issue.  You also have the issue of having a box with only 1 or 2 cups in it taking up space.I like this coffee, but somewhat torn if I will buy again since makes my k-cup storage drawer useless.  Plus would need to find space in the fridge or cabinets.  If the coffee was superior this would not be an issue, but honestly for me its not.One question, Kauai coffee is from Hawaii, yet the box states this is a &#34;product of Canada&#34;.  I'm guess the coffee (or beans) are shipped to Canada where they are ground and packaged.  Anyone know?", "This coffee is some of the most flavorful I have ever tried for the Keurig. As opposed to some brews - this one you can even brew with the maximum amount of water not lose any flavor.It comes in a little different packaging - the K-cups are inside a package like a pound of coffee and the K-cups themselves are not plastic cups but have some sort of paper or something (see the photo I uploaded) - so that is why they look a little different because they have to expand to they look a little loose before they are brewed.", "I was a little surprised to receive these KCups and discover that instead of the normal plastic housing that most Kcups contain, these were more like a mini filter. As someone who is attempting to keep the environment cleaner, this was a nice change for me and made me feel better about using Kcups.As far as the flavor of the coffee, it is smooth and flavorful. Not strong but not weak and definitely not bitter. I did try making a 10 oz. cup, and that was too weak for my tastes. The 8 oz. cup was perfect.", "I don't drink coffee, but got these for hubby.  Hubby really enjoys this coffee, very smooth and full bodied.Please note that these are not K-cups...they actually have the cheesecloth style bottom.  Still works well in the Keurig but the freshness does not last as long as K-cups, so take care to store in a cool dry location (not in the garage)!", "\"The coffee had a nice medium roast flavor.  Stronger than light roasts, but no where near as robust as a dark roast.  The \"\"cup\"\" seemed to brew really well in both of my makers.  I found no grounds in the bottom of the cup in either of the first two pods I drank.The inner bag is a nice touch. You can reseal it to help preserve the flavor/freshness once opened. Since the bottom of the \"\"cup\"\" is really a filter bag, without this I'm sure they could go stale pretty quickly.I gave it a 4/5 rating only because it is hard to tell from the packaging if the coffee in the cup is actually \"\"Hawaiian\"\" or if it is just packaged in Hawaii.  The box was also marked \"\"Product of Canada\"\" which was confusing since the box talks about the farm in Hawaii.\"", "Nice smooth taste.  I enjoyed this coffee.  I like the way the cups are made to reduce plastic.  The only thing about that though is that they sometimes get stuff in the top when you open the brewer  - really not a big deal, but thought I'd at least mention it.", "Absolutely love this Kauai Coffee Garden Isle Medium Roast Coffee. Previously I have had a cup of hot chocolate in the morning. Most coffees I have used are a little bitter. This coffee is soooooooooo smooth yet strong. I add a little splenda for my sweet tooth. Delicious delightful coffee and I am adding this to my monthly order of detergent and a few other items. Love love love this coffee a delightful to any morning!", "These K-cups produce a very nice cup of Hawaiian coffee.  There is great flavor and the vacuum sealed packaging makes sure the coffee stays fresh.  This is American made coffee which comes at a reasonable price.", "by using these convenient single dose cups, you will not waste coffee and it gives you a standard single cup serving.", "I wasn't sure what to expect with this coffee. First , the packaging is different from any other K-Cup I've used. The cups are in a sealed airtight pouch to help keep the coffee as fresh as possible. The design of the cups is also different, looking more like a coffee filter rather than a plastic cup. This looks a little strange at first, but I think it really helps with the flavor. This coffee actually tasted much better than I expected. It was great without adding anything to it. I occasionally drink my coffee black and this is a good coffee for that. I would encourage any coffee drinker to try this out.", "This is the first time that I've ever tried Kauai Coffee.  I've had plenty of other coffees over the years, from regional awesomeness like Community, Seaport, and Mello Joy to to more commercial brands like Green Mountain and Starbucks.  My favorite is Community, but that might be due to the fact that I grew up with the stuff (coffee milk from grandma's house was the best).With Kauai's Garden Isle Medium Roast, there's a bit of bite at the end of each sip, and I enjoy that.  The flavor is light, but the &#34;return&#34; on caffeine is wonderful.  This is a very bold medium roast, and it provides quite the kickstart to your morning.The single serve cups, suitable for Keurig brewers, feature a plastic top similar to K-cups.  One the bottom however, instead of having a plastic cup, they feature a small filter.  Essentially, it's the exact same as the K-cups minus the plastic cup on the bottom.  This does cut back on plastic, but it does leave a tad bit of a mess in the brewer.  Other than that, I commend Kauai for cutting back on plastics.Definitely recommended.", "This was a pleasant surprise upon my first sip. I was surprised when I opened the box and instead of having the larger mini coffee cups, it was a firm top but a filtered and soft bottom. I wasn't sure they would fit our Keurig but they dropped in easily. The coffee was nice, medium roast with a soft flavor. The box disappeared (due to use) pretty quickly.", "I love Kona coffee. That and Blue Mountain are my favorites. A couple of months ago, I found Kauai ground coffee on sale at my local grocer and gave it a shot. Both myself and my wife were impressed. It has most of the characteristics of a rich and mellow Kona coffee without the huge price tag. Even in pre-ground form it was good.Fast forward a few weeks and I get these K-cup single-serve compatibles from Amazon. I've found many K-cups to be a bit weak and unimpressive, but was pleased to find that these compatibles live up to the Kauai standard.  While perhaps oh-so-slightly weaker than what I would brew in the regular coffee maker, they still retain their flavor as single-serve options. The format is not quite K-cup, but worked well in my unit and looks like it is more environmentally friendly.I only use my Keurig occasionally, but I've found a K-cup that I am happy to stock for those occasions!~ Kort", "I have never before had any Kauai Coffee product (this review is for the Garden Isle Medium Roast) and was a bit surprised that the price was so reasonable as other Hawaiian coffees I had seen were rather expensive.  Once I tried it, I was hooked.  This is an excellent morning cup of coffee that was liked both by me (I prefer strong) and my wife (who likes a milder cup).  It has enough body to let you know your drinking real coffee without any of the bitterness and kick in the teeth aftertaste that sometimes follows.  This is a coffee good enough for company at an everyday cup price.  I will definitely need to try their other products.", "This coffee is a medium roast and has a wonderful smell when it is percolating.  It is a medium roast and has a very good slightly sweet taste to it even when drinking it &#34;black.&#34;  The k-cup itself is a little different looking than other k-cups with more of a mesh liner which means that I can't store it the same way I do the other k-cups.  I think this is the only thing I didn't really care for.", "When it has came down to us, coffee has became the most popular beverage we each take outside of soda, and milk. But finding the most robust flavor of a cup of Joe that is strong, but not too much of a problem can take a lot of searching. For me, I have had Colombian Coffee, Arabica and Mexican coffees. But I have been very skeptical about trying Hawaiian-made coffee, and wanted to see if it was as strong as it could be. Kauai Coffee Garden Isle Medium Roast honestly isn't as strong as most other grown brands. It takes like any traditional medium roast though, brought up from volcanic ash, but tastes at least a bit milder than stronger roasts that have been too much from the drink itself. Still, I do suggest you give this a shot, and try this Medium Roast in your Keurig coffeemaker.Price: BTaste & Quality: BOverall: B", "When I first opened the box I thought I had made a mistake ordering.  I wanted coffee for my Keurig and this coffee is sealed in a foil bag.  Interesting.  I opened the bag and again thought I had made a mistake.  These are not k-cups.  The top looks like the foil top of a k-cup but the bottom is just a filter. No plastic cup to be punctured!  I looked a the package and verified that it says - compatible with k-cup brewing systems.  Okay!  Already I smell fresh roasted coffee because it's not sealed in a little plastic cup.  I popped it in the machine and selected the large cup.  It brewed just fine and the coffee still smelled really good.  In addition, even on the large, my coffee had a medium roast flavor.  It wasn't watered down and tasteless and it didn't taste burned either.  It was just good coffee and made me think of Gevalia.  I like that there's not plastic cup going in to the landfills and it's a much better cup of coffee than when I carefully measure grounds into the &#34;my k-cup&#34; filter.  I plan to try some of Kauai's other flavors since this one was so good.", "\"Although some coffees from Hawaii have a reputation for ranking as some of the world's better coffees Kauai Coffee seems to equate being the biggest U.S. coffee farm (as if there are really a lot of coffee farms elsewhere in the U.S.) with being the best. That argument is like McDonald's saying they have the finest food because they are the biggest restaurant chain. The argument doesn't make sense and I fail to see why Kauai Coffee would rest their laurels on it.As several of the 3, 2 & 1 star Amazon reviews from real customers' state, this coffee is disappointingly lacking in fullness and richness of flavor. Those reviews are likely more trustworthy than the ones that gush about how perfect Kauai Coffee can be in general if it is professionally prepared.This product as described on this Amazon page is actually pretty tasty but not extremely satisfying. It is best described as ordinary. I know that some of the top-rated reviews disagree and rave about rich flavor but for some strange reason they aren't reviewing this product at all but Kauai Coffee that they bought for their French-press coffee maker. That's as apples vs. oranges as you can get ... I'm sure ANY coffee will taste better when painstakingly prepared in a French-press rather than in a K-cup brewer. Cutting to the chase, THIS product, the K-cup packaging of Kauai Coffee is accurately described by those who say it lacks fullness and richness.Since this is a K-cup product it is worthy to note that the pod is not the usual one we have come to expect but rather more like a semi-rigid tea bag. It is not as tall as a K-cup so the bottom doesn't get pierced. That can mean that the flow into your cup isn't quite as controlled ... instead of always squirting a steady stream into the middle of the cup you may find that some of the pods shoot off to the side and hit the rim of your cup. The pods (which are fully K-cup compatible) really are not designed to fit any of the K-cup storage racks and to do so would expose the entire pod of coffee to the air, which would degrade the flavor even further. The pods are shipped in a re-sealable foil bag and should be stored in that bag until ready to brew.One of the exceptional virtues of a K-cup brewer is that you can have a new flavor every day or even several new flavors in one day. That is a different concept than buying a larger quantity of coffee and having the same thing every day in your French-press or other coffee-maker. On that merit, yes, I would try it again but not if I was looking for a coffee-nirvana experience.[UPDATE] While the following information didn't change our rating it may be of interest to customers shopping for this product. Despite the packaging this product is in fact made in Canada and \"\"distributed\"\" by Kauai Coffee Company. That certainly changes the image of how it is manufactured. A few years ago it was discovered that Primo Hawaiian Beer is actually manufactured in Hood River, Oregon. Just FYI.\"", "I'm not really crazy about these crossover-pod things because they ALWAYS stick in the Keurig housing after use and have to be winkled out.  However these are a LOT stronger than other K-pods I've had - good at the grande setting.  They have QUITE a kick!I also like the fact that the pods are all inside a resealable freshness bag.  Otherwise I'd worry about freshness with those paper pods.  I still like regular k-cups better, but these work!", "This has a bold, strong taste which is slightly acidic. If you like a strong coffee then this is perfect for you. These single serve cups are soft on the bottom (like a teabag) and allow the coffee to brew instead of just a regular flow-through K-Cup. These take about twice as long to make a cup of coffee with the Keurig as a regular plastic K-Cup does. They come in a foil pouch that closes for freshness.", "These cups may be made for a Keurig or other single serve coffee machine. But the packaging is nothing like regular K-cups. Unfortunately, only the top is rigid plastic - the rest is a coffee filter, thing paper. So it wont stay fresh nearly as long as regular k-cups. And it fits awkwardly in my k-cup holder. The flavor is decent, but not worth the bad packaging. I prefer my coffee to stay fresh.", "I will say from the outset that I am not a coffee connoisseur.  I like coffee but I am no expert.  I found this coffee to be ok.  It seemed a bit bitter for me.  The taste wasn't bad..but wasn't exceptional or particularly distinct.  If it is at a good price, I am ok with it.", "I liked very much how these cups are packaged.  They are in a recloseable wrap, so they can be kept air-tight, and when they were opened, I loved the rich coffee smell---something often missing with these single-cup style coffees.  The coffee when made has a good taste---quite rich and a little darker than I expected.  It has just a touch more of a bitter taste than I like, but my husband, who is a stronger coffee lover, thought it was just right.  It makes a nice hearty cup of coffee!  My husband plans on buying this brand again for sure."], "A": [0.05505122244358063, 0.02806038409471512, 0.0019045452354475856, 0.03440398350358009, 0.036764249205589294, 0.04308333247900009, 0.0197287704795599, 0.03298172354698181, 0.042081769555807114, 0.02144422009587288, 0.033445101231336594, 0.04938792809844017, 0.010165572166442871, 0.06380422413349152, 0.04474537447094917, 0.04272380843758583, 0.05227421224117279, 0.042229488492012024, 0.021587196737527847, 0.018814267590641975, 0.012361054308712482, 0.029314789921045303, 0.03270592913031578, 0.011407737620174885, 0.019379470497369766, 0.009770478121936321, 0.032358404248952866, 0.04115564748644829, 0.0548325851559639, 0.03228489309549332, 0.029747681692242622]}
