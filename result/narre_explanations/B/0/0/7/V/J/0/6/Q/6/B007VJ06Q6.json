{"reviews": ["Game is a fun little side scrolling beat em up with RPG elements. The sorceress characters disproportionate body was hillarious but could be considered offensive (her breasts are bigger than her torso each). Game gets quite challenging later on.", "So this is my first time playing the game. It is an RPG dungeon crawler and its very good in what it does. You get a thief who opens chest for you. You get quests at the adventure guild. There are also main missions as well. You can have 4 CPU controlled players join you or turn it off.You also get a fairy but i haven't used her yet (for whatever purpose she serves it flew over my head something to do with runs on stone and walls but nothing happens when i walk near them). I have played the single player campaign and had one person join randomly. He was like some tree like enemy. He didn't attack etc just walked with me lol. useless if you ask me. The games difficulty is just right. not hard not easy. there are many items to unlock and when you are at the end of a mission you get a rank based on treasure and secrets found. than you appraise or take it all etc. that is basically the whole game and there is a lot of TNA's lol BUY THIS GAME!!", "If you had play side-scrolling games &#34;Golden Axe&#34; and/or &#34;Dungeons and Dragons&#34; than you will be excited by Dragon's Crown.  There is plenty of none stop action.  Different characters to choose from with different playing/fighting styles.  Also, multiple paths to take make your decisions more interesting.  I brought this game for the Vita it does an excellent job but I think a large screen like on Flat screen(27 inches or larger) would had been better for this game.  Beside this small set back this is still a great game!!!!", "DC is a solid action RPG with a lot of depth in terms of customization. Character skills and weaponry are the main items that contribute to the overall depth of the game, which makes this game very addicting. Level design and artwork are great as well. One might argue that this game will get repetitive over time given that many side missions encourage you to revisit levels that you have already played, but this is entirely optional.  Every mission earns you XP which contributes to you leveling up, which in turn allows you to upgrade your skills with the skill points that are rewarded to you.Once you unlock online play, which takes place around the 5-hour mark in campaign mode, you have the optional to team up with others online which is a necessity if you wish to complete the plot in its entirety. While this seems like a forced way of making you play online, it generally works out well. This can be good or bad depending on what kind of player you get. It can get frustrating in cases if other players don't work towards the goal. For example, without giving away any spoiler, on one mission to retrieve a talisman, if all players don't work together, you cannot defeat the boss, which forces you to try again.Some players have reported frame rate issues especially when there is a lot of activity on the screen at one time. After about 12 hours of play, I have not yet seen anything noticeable yet either online or off.All in all, I really enjoyed this game, much more than I expected. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys action/RPG games.", "The Good: Gorgeous visuals, fun and fast paced combat, plenty of loot and levels to acquireThe Bad: Almost no main quest line or story, very short in length, very few levels, best experience is only with other peopleVanillaware is known for one of the hardest JRPGs on the PS2, Odin Sphere, and I was very excited upon hearing the spiritual successor to that game. While Dragon&#8217;s Crown isn&#8217;t nearly as hard as that game (it&#8217;s much more forgiving) it still has a lot of challenges that await you. Dragon&#8217;s Crown&#8217;s biggest disappointment is its short length. There&#8217;s almost no main quests and contains mainly side quests (about 50). Once you finish the game you unlock a hard mode and then an Inferno mode. Thankfully the game can be played with up to 4 players so it can be a blast.The story is about a Crown that has been taken by an Ancient Dragon. Your job is to return this crown to your kingdom and kill the dragon. The story is very light and I know there could have been so much more here. But the super short length makes it impossible for a better story. There are very few cut scenes and not much spoken dialogue (which is only done by a narrator). Once you jump into the game you can attack, use items, cast spells, and use the right analog stick to move a hand around the screen to collect treasure. You always have a non-fighting thief with you who can pick locks on hidden doors and open chests. Sadly, you can&#8217;t change out your equipment during a mission (most levels can be passed in less than 10 minutes). However, at the end of each level is a boss and they increase in difficulty throughout all 8 levels or so. Each level has two bosses at different levels for various players.Once you finish a mission you can return to town to appraise your items, bury or resurrect bones you find in levels for new AI partners, level up, acquire new quests, and buy runes. Runes are found throughout levels in pairs which need to be matched with runes in your possession. These add various buffs to your party which can turn the tide of a battle. Outside of those main things there&#8217;s not much to do besides hit the level cap. The missions are extremely repetitive since you need to find 9 talisman before facing the Ancient Dragon (that&#8217;s almost all there is to the entire main quest line) and once you are able to beat the Ancient Dragon (probably when you&#8217;re around level 30) you do it all over again on a harder difficulty. It gets kind of boring after a while and extremely tough towards the end. It&#8217;s best to go in with actual people since your AI partners can mess things up. Thankfully, unlike Odin Sphere, you have lives and can even pay to keep reviving with your coins. This alleviates some of the frustration.I just wish there was so much more to this game. It feels so small and claustrophobic. The short levels, the nearly non-existent quest line and story, but at least the characters you pick are fun to use and the controls work well. The art itself is stunning with beautiful water-color backdrops and crazy looking enemies and bosses. This game is mainly designed for fans of the co-0p arcade RPGs of yesteryear from Capcom. Not much of a story, but tons of combat and enemies to kill and levels to acquire. If you want a story heavy RPG like The Elder Scrolls or Fable you won&#8217;t find that here.", "I was on the fence considering this game for awhile, but after checking it out at E3 I knew it was going to be great. It has a very high replay value, despite the limited number of environments and levels, probably because of all the rpg elements. Not only are there 6 completely unique characters to level, all of which have varying skills and playstyles, but it never feels like a grind becuase of all the treasure there is to collect. You can set up one set of gear specifically for fighting against dragons, and another if you know you're going to be fighting a bunch of demons. The environments are also beautiful, and display absolutely wonderfully on the Vita screen. Although the game has a lot of fast-paced action in the heat of battle, sometimes it's nice, when you aren't laying waste to a horde of undead, to appreciate the detail that was paid to each of the game's many backdrops.", "\"I've been playing video games for a long time. Some of my fondest memories are of when I was a kid and me and my friends would be at an arcade that had one of the 4 player side scrolling brawlers. Dungeons & Dragons and the Avengers are the two that stick out the most. I always loved those games but as time went on and as real arcades (not Dave and Buster's) have essentially gone away, side scrollers seemed to fade with them. When I initially read about Dragon's Crown, I was intrigued. It looked like an updated Dungeon's & Dragons and the artwork appeared to be phenomenal (it is.). I was still on the fence however. Side scrollers never had a lot of substance and without my friends next to me would this be worth my $40? That answer is a solid YES.I've put about 10.5 hours into the game so far and have a level 27 Wizard. Dragon's Crown is a side scroller and, as I had hoped, is essentially Dungeons & Dragons for 2013. The artwork and animation is STUNNING. The tutorial is quick and simple, easy to learn/harder to master. Gameplay is a lot of the button mashing you would expect but there are enough abilities in there that it's at least focused button mashing. 99% of the time I can honestly say \"\"I meant to do that.\"\" If you've been itching for a side scrolling brawler that isn't just an HD re-release, this is it. My concern was paying $40 for an hour of nostalgia. I was worried that once my appetite for the past had been satisfied, I'd be done with the game. Fortunately, Dragon's Crown is anything but just a pretty brawler.What you have here is a beautiful marriage of side-scrolling brawling with traditional RPG dungeon crawling. You pick from one of six classes; Warrior, Amazon, Dwarf (berserker), Elf (archer), Sorceress and Wizard. Each class has their own abilities and as you complete quests and gain levels you are rewarded skill points to customize your class. As in all good dungeon crawlers, there's no shortage of loot. Chests are scattered throughout each dungeon and enemies drop loot as well. When you finish the dungeon you are presented with a list of items you've picked up. All the information is question-marked out and you have to decide if you want to pay to have it appraised or just sell it. The item's description indicates what type the item is, which classes can use it as well as the quality of the item (S,A,B,C,D,E) and any level requirements. The information that is question-marked out is the damage, durability, name and any stat increases or enchantments it provides. You can only equip a certain number of items and spells (this can be increased by spending skill points), but when you get further in the game you can have multiple \"\"packs\"\" that have different equipment configurations that you can swap out at certain points in each dungeon. Money comes generously and I've never been strapped for gold.The story takes place in the form of quests. There is the primary story that exists throughout the game and then there are little side stories for the side quests. There isn't MUCH story taking place in the actual dungeons but occasionally you'll walk into a room and there will be a picture of an NPC and some story will unfold. However, most of it takes place either in dialogue in the various areas of the village or in the written requests you pick up from the guild hall. The side quests are cool because not only do you gain skill points, exp and gold for completing them, but you unlock a painting that is themed with the quest you completed and has a paragraph or two of flavor text that accompanies it. These are stored in your gallery for future viewing. I like this because it breaths more life into the world. Overall, the story is interesting and balanced well. You're not going to feel like you've been abandoned because you haven't been updated in hours and you won't feel like you're playing an interactive movie. You know what's going on in the world and what your role is.The skill system is really successful as well. It's not a tree like in the Diablo series. You have two wheels of cards that represent abilities and stat increases. One wheel is class specific, one is general and identical for all classes. Each card has a level requirement and costs a set amount of points. You can select the one you like as long as you meet the lvl requirements and have the points. Each card has a certain number of levels (i.e. Wood Golem 0/7 levels) and you can continue upgrading them (again as long as you meet the level requirements and have the points) if you wish or just unlock the first level and move on. With 1 point earned for each level and up to several points awarded for quest completions, character building happens fast. The wheel system, I feel, gives you more freedom to tailor your character to what you feel you need without being forced to spend your points on things you don't want to get abilities you need or level abilities higher than you would like. Every stat increase and ability I possess I have because I felt I needed it and wanted to spend my points on it.The dungeons are interesting and varied. The atmosphere is great. It's typical side scrolling where you will progress forward, be assaulted by several enemies, move forward, repeat several times, fight a boss, finish. The touch screen of the Vita is used well as there are false walls and treasures hidden throughout. There are secret rooms and side rooms that may contain chests or items to satisfy quests. It's not just hold the analog stick to the right and mash the X button. Paying attention is rewarding. Throughout the dungeons you will find piles of bones which can be resurrected in the village for a price. Once resurrected, you can add them to your party in the pub. These NPCs come pre-equipped (you can't change anything) and will be one of the standard classes. They allow you to build a party before you unlock multiplayer and once you have unlocked multiplayer, they allow you to fill in the gaps. This is a multiplayer game and you will find it difficult if you try to do the dungeons without party members. The NPCs are pretty intelligent and it's rare that I find myself cursing at them for doing something stupid. You also have an armory that holds your items you haven't equipped. Your armory is available to all of the classes you created so if you found an awesome S-quality bow while playing your wizard, just hold on to it and your archer can grab it the next time you play her.There are also attack mounts you will find in some of the dungeons. So far I've seen a sabre-tooth panther and a raptor. They are found either in a cage or they attack you and must be subdued before you can ride them. They work the same as other games in the genre. You just hop on with the triangle button and then you button mash. The sabre-tooth panther is melee and the raptor breathes fire.Once you reach a certain point in the game (probably about 5-7 hours in) you will be allowed to go online. Each dungeon will also unlock a second path to a new, more difficult, boss encounter. Multiplayer is handled locally and through the PSN. It is drop in drop out and either random or friend based. You can adjust the settings in the Pub when you assemble your party. You have 3 slots for party members, You can slot in the NPCs you have recruited, then you can select Join On or Join Off for each slot. If Join On is selected when you're in the dungeon, a real life player may enter your game and replace the NPC that was in that slot with their character. If they leave, an NPC will pop back in after a few minutes. If Join Off is selected, that slot cannot be joined. It doesn't appear that you can communicate with random players that join your game. I've only done this a couple times though so maybe I'm missing something. This isn't necessarily a bad thing since there isn't a lot of strategy to be discussed and it also eliminates the chance encounters with people who don't know how to conduct themselves in random multiplayer games. Either way it works very well. If you want to join a friend's game, you can select the option and a list will populate with your online friends.Overall this game exceeded my expectations in every way. It captures the nostalgia of the classic side-scrolling beat-em-ups while adding enough complexity and story to make it a full-fledged RPG dungeon crawler, not just an arcade experience. The classes are varied and each one is unique from the rest. The story is great and paced well throughout the game. The leveling is not a chore but works well with, and is a bi-product of, playing the game. Multiplayer is fun and simple. Dungeons are varied, each having its own style and unique enemies, and are not too long/not too short. All the customization of skills and equipment is handled simply and effectively. This game has a lot of opportunity for expansion down the road so I imagine I'll be putting a lot of miles into it. This game just does everything it set out to do, and does it phenomenally. It took what it needed from a couple genres and made a simple yet perfect experience. Get it!For those debating the PS3 or Vita; I think this game works best on the Vita. Save yourself $10 and go portable. I don't think there is any loss of graphical quality and the touch screen provides a distinct advantage over the PS3 controls. Having the same experience on a portable platform is much more desirable in my opinion.\"", "If you've played either of the games I mentioned in my header and enjoyed them, Dragon's Crown is a game that was made for you. Combining the trademark Vanillaware aesthetic with the role-play brawler aspect of those games, Dragon's Crown delivers a fantastic experience and a first on the Vita. Beyond Vanillaware's involvement, though, there were members of the Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess teams that worked on Dragon's Crown, and a lot of their art's available in the free art book that accompanied launch copies of the game.As for the game, it has all the elements you'd want out of a role-playing game, so you have tons of loot, leveling up, tons of characters to play as, tons of quests to take on, and hours of hours of content to keep you busy. As for the gameplay, it mostly feels like a beat 'em up, but it all plays very smoothly. I loved Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess, so Dragon's Crown was definitely in my wheelhouse. I'd love to see more games like this.In terms of graphics, Dragon's Crown is a winner. Combining Vanillaware's beautiful visual approach with the talents of Kinu Nishimura and Gouda Cheese brings the best out of the 2D art, making this one stunning game to see in action.Overall, Dragon's Crown is one of the Vita's best games. Not only does it play well, but it offers depth in the form of RPG elements beyond merely being a beat 'em up, and it'll keep you playing for a very long time."], "A": [0.16412819921970367, 0.008598280139267445, 2.1900952162923204e-07, 0.003115855623036623, 0.4447503983974457, 0.3591054081916809, 0.019943371415138245, 0.0003582073550205678]}
