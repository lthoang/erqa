{"reviews": ["I recently had over 6 inches of my long hair cut off for a shorter hair style with tons of layers. My hair is actually pretty thick, so when I found that this was actually meant for those with fine or thin hair, I figured it may not do much for me. To my surprise it actually worked quite well for my hair.What I was looking for was something to help style my hair. I needed something that would help keep the fluffy layers from being weighted down, but also something that would help my hair hold a curled under style I get by blow-drying it with a round brush. This Dove Leave In Foam worked just for that. It didn't weigh my hair down, but helped keep the ends of my hair perfectly brushed under for the style I keep my hair in. It works like a light weight mouse, keeping hair fluffy by providing a little bit of hold.", "This is a hybrid product. It serves as a leave in conditioner and a light styling aid. The white foam pumps easily and has a pleasant light fragrance. Pump one or two dollops into your hands, rub between palms and apply evenly through hair from roots to tips. Style as usual. It may be applied to either damp or dry hair.I found the product easy and pleasant to use. Unlike some leave in conditioners, it did not add too much weight. There was an increase in volume. My hair felt nice. Unlike some styling aids, it didn't make it sticky or crunchy.  It is, however, not a replacement for hair spray, root lift, styling wands, curlers or straighteners. Still, when used on its own, it did give my fine medium length hair a bit of a boost and a very light hold and that is an improvement.", "I try to keep a hair style that I can wash, brush or comb, and go.  In the past I usedTRESemme Extra Firm Control Tres Mousse, Extra Hold, 10.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)to keep my hair in place.  It worked but left my hair stiff and wet looking all day.Dove Leave in Foam keeps my hair in place, exactly the way I brush or comb it, without the wet look and stiffness of TRESemme. Even when it drys I can brush or comb it again and it still stays in place and leaves my hair so soft to the touch.  It's not sticky when applying and has a nice light fragrance.  This is the absolute best leave in styling aid that I have used.", "\"Got this product to compare with another leave-in foam. This is NOT a mousse, so it doesn't give your hair any type of hold at all.  Unlike the other leave-in foam I ordered, this one is not as soapy as the other one.  I find this is best used on damp hair (not wet, otherwise, it will feel like you're shampooing your hair). It doesn't feel as sticky as the other leave-in foam I've tried.  Whether I work it on just the roots or through the whole head, it doesn't matter. It is very light that as soon as you blow dry your hair, your hair immediately becomes full of body. Just brushing or combing upwards from the roots to tips while blow drying helps to \"\"set in\"\" the body. I looked like I had more hair than I normally do!  That's how voluminous it makes my hair look. However, because it doesn't hold, if there's a strong wind, your hair will fall flat again. If you re-comb your hair during the day, it will fall flat also. And if you're in a room with some humidity in it, your hair will slowly fall flat again.  Since we're still experiencing below freezing temps here where I live, this product is perfect! I look like I just came from the salon when I get to work. As long as I don't get holed up in a heated conference room with the humidity coming off of several people, and as long as I don't comb my hair, my hair looks great the whole day. The wonderful smell also lasts the entire day.  It reminds me of the small white honeysuckle flowers in Asia that I love. The caveat comes the moment I shampoo: I get extra sudsy hair because, after all, this IS a leave-in-foam.\"", "I love Dove products so I thought I would try this leave in styling foam.  I have another brand that I have used and works just great but when I saw Dove had a similar product, I wanted to try it.The first time, I used quite a bit and when I tried to brush my hair the next time, it was like I was 10 again and my mom was &#8220;pulling&#8221; my hair to brush it.  So I thought I had used too much.  I tried again using considerably less.  I had the same results.It doesn&#8217;t leave my hair feeling soft and it holds well.  If you don&#8217;t mind the &#8220;tangled brushing and pulling&#8221; and lack of softness, this product works great.", "I'm finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products. Mostly the benefit here is that it smells nice and doesn't leave things exceptionally stiff. You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most.", "I do not have fine or flat hair... I have thick and wavy hair and my big problem is that it gets very frizzy. I was really happy with this product for my hair. It smelled nice, and I put a lot in, but it didn't weight down my hair or make it feel stiff or clumpy. Instead it helped keep away the frizz and made the most of my natural waves. It gave the control I was looking for without the stiffness.There was no wet chemical or product look or smell.  It made my hair look healthy and shiny. It stayed nice for a few days (because my hair is dry I don't wash it every day) and never got greasy. I am very happy with this product and would use it again.", "I've tried and liked Dove brand shampoos and conditioners in the past, but had never tried any of their styling products, so I was excited to try this out.  I thought it worked pretty well, especially for the money.  It's not a miracle product (though I wouldn't expect one for the price) but it does do a good job of giving my hair body without making it stiff.  I especially appreciate that it doesn't seem to create a lot of build up on the hair so I can wear my hairstyle of a couple of days (with small touchups from my flat iron) before I need to wash it again.Would recommend.", "This foam is easier to spread evenly if one's hair is damp or wet.  I think it smells excellent.  It feels healthy for hair.  I used it to protect my hair somewhat from chlorine as I'm a swimmer.  It helped a lot in that capacity.", "This won't give you helmet head, but it does provide volume to thin limp hair. After shampooing, apply to the roots and style. I used this and had adequate hold and lift that lasted through the day.Overall, it had a pleasant scent and it worked.", "I like this product. It is easy to apply and has a nice smell. It seems to help control my hair. I have applied it both on wet and dry hair and recommend putting it on wet hair; it left my hair looking greasy when I applied it on my dry hair.", "Over the years, it has been hard to find hair styling products that actually work on my baby fine, thin hair and fly a way hair! And I have tried so many products from the expensive beauty shop ones to higher end ones at my local store and all they did for me was make my hair stiff and have a hairspray smell!Then I tried the Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave in Foam and I was not sure what to expect. So I tried it according to the directions on the bottle. Since my hair was damp after showering, I towel dried it and applied this and blew my hair dry (and I turned my head upside down and shook my head to make my hair look fuller also) Then for some curl and lift, I went onto my curling iron.Results: My hair looks shinier and THICKER! And best of all, it was not STIFF or have a hairspray scent, the scent is fresh and clean.If this will work on my THIN and BABY FINE hair, I believe that it will work on your hair.Highly recommend this!", "I had not been very happy with the texture and condition of my hair. It was just stiff and frizzy. Finally one day I had washed and styled my hair and it was totally changed. It didn't have that stiff and frizzy finish to it. I thought it was because I had put some almond and coconut oil on my hair before I had washed and styled it. But then sure enough, the next day when I washed and styled my hair, back was that fuzzy, frizzy and stiff hair. It finally hit me. It was the Dove Leave-in Foam. That was the thing that I had done different that one day that my hair felt really nice. That day, I had not used the Dove. I had to be sure that was the problem with my hair. So the next night, I once again didn't use my Dove Leave-in Foam. Yup, normal hair.I'm glad I finally figured out what was giving my hair that awful texture. Nope, I won't be using the Dove Leave-in Foam again. It was really a disappointment to me too because I normally love Dove products.", "I don't see much difference in this product compared to a classic mousse.  My hair doesn't feel softer, but a little sticky and stiff.  It provides good hold, but seems to weigh my hair down a little.  Maybe my hair is just too thin for this product.", "Dove is a fine product for what it was meant to be. Howeve, in the last few years Dove is branching out and sometimes with merely so-so results - like this product.I have long overly processed hair and do not was it everyday so I won't further damage it. This product sounded just like it was made for me; something I could use on dry hair to add lift to it and have my hair looks as if it was freshly washed and blown out. All while nourishing and moisturizing my hair.I did not find it to work as promised, it did not add any moisturizing properties or lifting properties to my hair whenever my hair was wet OR dry.I could have gotten the same results from mousse at half the cost.Comment Comment | Permalink", "I used this product with the matching shampoo and conditioner. I wanted to give it the best shot possible to win me over. The smell (like all of Dove's products) was enticing. And, while it did add volume, I had that distinct &#34;there's something in my hair&#34; feeling. I guess I prefer products that leave hair feeling completely natural. It's a quirk, I guess. (I know lots of people who use hairspray and have sticky, hard hair ... and they never seem to mind. So, I may be in the minority here).I vote that if you are seeking a product that provides volume, this is worth a try (especially since it is so inexpensive)!", "I love this it smells great. It works great. I feel like it isn't too heavy. It makes my hair easier to style. I even use it on my daughters hair when I braid it to help it stay in place. Works great.", "Dove is a favorite brand in my household.I prefer Dove shampoo, deodorant and body wash products and my wife also has her favorite Dove products, including the Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam.She does not always want to have to apply a hair lotion and then have to rinse, blow dry, etc., and so there is a special appeal to applying this product and leaving it in her hair all day. Dove's Oxyfusion Technology provides volume, moisture and nourishment while you care for and style your hair.You can use it along with shampoos or conditioners or as a stand-alone product. The results will vary according to how naturally straight and dry your hair is. You can recomb your hair during the day and still keep the results you liked in the morning.So feel comfortable to add this Dove Leave In Foam to your cabinet. I don't think you will be disappointed.", "this is a really nice foam leave in conditioner that is easy to apply.  Put about a pecan size foam in palm and rub together  and  apply through out hair,  then comb through and style. It keeps a nice light hold and makes hair shiny and beautiful.  Love the nice floral scent, but it doe diminish during the day.", "This foam is light and airy and can be combed easily through hair. My hair had noticeable volume when I dried it and throughout the day.", "I think of and use this as a mousse. I have thick,dry,curly hair so I need the moisture this product provides. I use this on wethair. I use 3 to 4  pumps and just work it through my hair. I then fingerstyle my hair. I allow it to air dry. This product leaves my hair with very little frizz and my curls looks shiny not crispy and dry. I find not combing it and letting it air dry the key to making this work.I also tried it on my hair when it was dry and it just left my hair sticky.  Overall I really like the product and its reasonably priced. Also the scent is lovely. The scent lasts all day but its not overpowering.A definite must try!", "I have very fine, thin short hair, which flies everywhere from the lightest wind. This helps to hold my hair in place without being too stiff or weighing my hair down. It smells very good as well. I prefer putting it on my hair when my hair is wet, and styling as usual.", "I love this stuff. I feel lucky to have found it. I cannot recommend it highly enough.This foam smells great. I put it in wet hair and comb with a wide tooth comb. Then I just let it dry. It gives me soft bouncy curls. Great curls. It gives me better curls than without or with other products. I just love it.  I can even use it on day or two old hair and it bumps my hair back up.Its magical.", "You are really supposed to use this on damp hair, but I like using just a tiny amount on dry hair to tame fly-aways.  The hold on this IS really light.  If you need to rely on any sort of hold, I would not recommend this and I'd say stick to a traditional mousse, gel or hairspray.  This would probably be best for the person who does not wear a lot of product in their hair but just wants to have it smoothed down.This product is foamy like dish soap suds, where as mouse is foamy more like shaving cream.  This has a lighter consistency.  less weighty.I note this product is similar in ingredients, look and feel to Suave's kid's mousse which is alcohol free.", "Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave in Foam is a setting agent.  The instructions say you can use on wet or dry hair.  I have used it both ways and do not recommend it on dry hair.  It did not seem to do anything on dry hair.  However, it does work well on wet hair.  I have thin, fine hair and it gave me the body I want from a setting lotion.  I am using it with Dove Oxygen Conditioner which I also got from Amazon Vine.  The two work very well together.  My hair felt soft and was easy to style.  I saw on one of the TV programs that this combination of Dove products were a must have for the stars at the Oscars.  If they are good enough for the stars they are certainly good enough for me.", "This product didn't do much for me. It smelled nice, but I didn't notice much of a difference when using it.", "I have been eying Dove's new Oxygen Moisture product line for a little while now. After trying it, I have to say I am quite disappointed. While the smell is amazing (I want everything now to smell like this stuff), the product itself doesn't do much for me. The Leave in Foam worked a lot better than the Oxygen Moisture Conditioner did, but not by much.", "I expected this styling product to WOW me but it did not. This leave in non-fragrant foam is for fine, flat hair. My hair is fine and long and is flat to wavy but will curl on its own if left to air dry or in rainy weather.Since my hair is long, I applied 3 pumps  (instead of the 1-2 pumps recommended) of the product to my hair focusing more on my ends. I then blow-dried my hair and it came out dry and straggly with not much hold.The Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam container says it delicately moisturizes and gives a light hold.  I got the light hold but the moisturizing component seems to be missing. This is not a product for me.", "I color, chemically process and generally abuse my hair pretty bad-so my stylist insist I condition, condition and condition Dove Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam delicately moisturizes hair. Its a light hold and pleasant smell. I prefer to use it on wet hair Dove makes quality items at a few price.", "I have thin long hair- After washing I apply and comb through.. I also use with a root spray but have used alone and still have the great effects of more body in hair! For the price you can't beat this product, I have added to my holy grail of products. I recommend to anyone who has thin hair!", "Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam is a very nice addition to my hair products.  It feels clean with a pleasant, not overpowering, scent.  I personally used 1 pump instead of the recommended 2 pumps, as my hair is very fine. I noticed no greasy feeling, no film on my hands from applying, and a clean and light fragrance.", "This product is great! Made my hair soft, shiny and smell great! This is something that I would buy and use! I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good leave in!"], "A": [0.030084894970059395, 0.02468240074813366, 0.024207646027207375, 0.0172412246465683, 0.029387127608060837, 0.03275866433978081, 0.03335943818092346, 0.03201611712574959, 0.03246632590889931, 0.031373798847198486, 0.03384748473763466, 0.0320427305996418, 0.031060921028256416, 0.03364061564207077, 0.029363596811890602, 0.03134448081254959, 0.03483377397060394, 0.024635907262563705, 0.03401340916752815, 0.03440214321017265, 0.029266003519296646, 0.03484734147787094, 0.03185686469078064, 0.03368324413895607, 0.03325144201517105, 0.03459108993411064, 0.033824317157268524, 0.03054649569094181, 0.02954656071960926, 0.03417181968688965, 0.03374093770980835, 0.033911146223545074]}
