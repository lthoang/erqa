{"reviews": ["I have tried dandelion tea before but this is a  new brand for me.  It has a delightful fresh taste to it though it was a bit weak like all the other brands I have tried before.  Due to the weak flavor, I put two tea bags in the second 8 ounce cup I brewed but it really did not change very much.  I think this herb just tastes like this.  It is pleasant tasting but I did not notice any increase in urine output.  I'll end up drinking it because of it's non acid, caffeine free delightful flavor.  Since I drink it black without sweetener, it is amazingly enjoyable.", "\"I've tried many dandelion teas, and this one, from Traditional Medicinals, is absolutely the best I've tasted. Made from both the leaves and root, it's organically grown and caffeine free, and non-GMO. Since it helps with digestion, it's great in the evening after dinner, and soothing enough to relax the body and mind before bed.The taste is delicate and very subtly, mildly sweet. It's a very gentle tea, with a slightly grassy aroma. The bags are sturdy...not one of those where the label tag falls off, and you're left with a bag in hot water and a floating string, as some herbal teas are packaged! And they are individually wrapped in easy to open packages. This is a top quality product, and very delicious.If you follow the \"\"Blood Type Diet\"\" for diabetes prevention, dandelion tea is in the \"\"Super Beneficial\"\" category for all 4 blood types. The box also says it supports healthy kidney function, as well as healthy digestion, as mentioned above. This is simply a delightful tea, and super healthy too.\"", "Not at all like tea, Dandelion has its own unique flavor, and by that I mean it taste like Dandelion Leaf and Root. Better to mention that I had never tried this product, even though I have drank many herbal, and exotic plants to produce their own version of a hot beverage, without saying they can not be had cold. Yerba Mate, Manzanilla, Mint, Chamonille, Ginseng, Mate de Coca (I tried that in Peru and did enjoy it very much, perhaps due to my addictive personality back then), and many more. I like most of the herbal varieties, and on occasions enjoy them very much, but predominantly I favor strong teas, the stronger the better, even though one time one was so strong it gave me the jitters, and I felt like my heart was going to fail which happily did not. That was the only time that I use loose leafs in an unheard amount, due to plain ignorance, and in no time I was wired and ready to freak out.Traditional Medicinals Herbal Tea, Dandelion Leaf and Root, 16 Count, (Pack of 6) is not capable of doing what high concentrations of caffeine are capable of, so it is a tranquil and agreeable time when I drink it. The flavor is difficult to describe, but let's just say it is very floral. As to the bitterness, I have discovered that the longer it brews in high temperatures, like just about any other comparable product, it tends to become bitter. Overall I found this drink very refreshing and soothing, and quite pleasing.There is such a vast world of herbals, that knowledge is mandatory to qualify anyone as an expert. They do have their virtues, and many help on different conditions, so it could be said that this type of beverage is healthier in the most part. Amazon, a class act in my world, was gracious enough to send us a package of this Dandelion, and for that we are thankful.Not the type of beverage that mixes with dairy, in my opinion, but very tasty hot or cold. Would I buy it on a regular basis? First I would get the book where all herbals are described by name and virtues, for taking a voyage to far and distant lands where people knows a lot more of all the natural remedies that can be consumed as a beverage, sounds a little steep for my eager wallet, but as soon as that seven/eleven rolls out clean the sky will be the limit. 4 Stars.", "This is a good, mild tea.  It has no bitter taste.  I like to drink tea (except black tea) without any sweetners - just plain.  This one is good like that.  Black tea upsets my stomach, while this tea does just the opposite.  I was having a bit of indigestion (after eating spicy foods) so I drank some of this and it soothed it a bit.", "This is a handy way to make an herbal tea - the dandelion leaf and root comes in tea bags, no additives or anything besides the herb. Dandelion is an herb used for a variety of health concerns, and this package comes with directions for its use. This item is certified organic and non-GMO, and Traditional Medicinals is a quality brand. Not everyone will like the taste of this tea, so you may want to add honey or stevia to sweeten it if the herbal taste doesn't suit you. This doesn't have any caffeine, and it just needs to be placed in hot water like any regular hot tea. This is ideal for anyone looking to use dandelion teas who likes their tea as a tea bag rather than just putting the herb loose into the water.", "This tea is not tasty and it comes with scary warnings on the label about don't drink it for more than two weeks at a time, don't give to children, etc. If you know you want to take some dandelion tea for your kidneys or your digestion I think this one would be a good choice, it's a good company, I pass by it sometimes in Sebastopol (or as I like to call it, &#34;The Hippie Town That Time Forgot&#34;) organic product, etc. If you are looking for a nice cup of tea, there are some teas out there that contain dandelion that some people think are a good substitute for a cup of coffee or whatever and THIS IS NOT THAT TEA.", "The following benefits of dandelion and dandelion roots have been documented for years:Digestive aid; kidney support; liver support; antioxidants; cancer prevention; blood sugar and insulin regulation; blood pressure modifier, cholesterol control; gallbladder support; reduced inflammation; immune system support.I drink tea every morning anyway, so it might as well be something that gives my body a healthy boost. But how does it taste?Frankly, based on where it grows, I expected it to taste like I imagine drinking grass would taste. But actually, it's got a very mild flavor. The closest thing I could probably compare it to would be echinacea tea. It would be great with a bit of honey, but it's perfect fine without. I actually leave the tea bag in to try to get the fullest possible flavor.With the non-GMO promise, you really have nothing to lose. I wouldn't want to drink it three times a day (and at those prices, can't really afford to), but as a morning let's-get-started, this is great.", "The health benefits of dandelions are well known.  A wonderful herb with antioxidant properties and tons of vitamins (A, C, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, magnesium) as well as a great source of dietary fiber.  This tea is made of organic dandelions and has no added flavors.  I tried another dandelion tea once and it was flavored with vanilla.  I ended up throwing it out.  They should have called it Vanilla tea, that's just how much of the delicate dandelion flavor you could detect in it!  That's just not for me!  I like to taste my herbs in my tea and not a lot of sweetness.If you are looking for a tea to promote good health and one that tastes natural yet not bitter, this one is for you.  A cup a day will keep you on the right track.", "This tea has a mild and pleasant flavor, even after being brewed for about 10 minutes. It is advertised to promote kidney function, or in other words, acts as a mild diuretic. This is a dandelion leaf and root tea which tastes a little different than straight dandelion root tea. I've had both and the root tea and this one and I think this has more of a diuretic effect and has a less roasted flavor and tastes more herb-like. Both are very good. Traditional Medicinals is a brand I trust because I've purchased many of their teas over the years and have never been disappointed.  They don't make wild claims like some of the products I see advertised. They just have good, dependable products that have had a good track record over the years, some based on ancient remedies.", "This product fell short on taste from no fault of its own because, in my opinion, Dandelion Tea usually needs other herbs as flavor enhancers.I was skeptical about the taste of this product being good enough by itself before I tried it.Still, I wanted to try it because the heal benefits are tremendous.And Traditional Medicinals is a trusted brand. What could they do to make this product better?I was curious.I usually harvest my own Roots from the garden....when I have time.I also don't like the new packaging. I like their Traditional, previous package.I like the Photo, but not the new logos. Their brand is like Campbell's Soup to me, iconic.I don't know if anyone could do better with Dandelions.I don't like the green taste from the leaves, which I don't usually use in my homemade Dandelion tea.If you have no trouble with Dandelion taste, or are open to adding other herbs to enhance the flavor, buy this product for the health benefits and work with it.Recommended.", "I'm not a stranger to Traditional Medicinals, having tried and enjoyed several of their teas, including the Roasted Dandelion Root, so I figured it would hurt to give this a try.I remember many years ago sampling a dandelion leaf and (unroasted) root tea and not liking it. It was so bitter and distasteful that not even unconscionable amounts of sugar could change my mind. That's what I was expecting this time around. But, I'm happy to say that this tea's flavour was much milder and palatable.With a spoonful or two of sugar (also tried with honey), this went down easily. It has a distinctly green taste with a slightly bitter aftertaste that wasn't jarring. While I wouldn't put this in my daily tea rotation, I could see downing a cup every few days just to give my kidneys a little wake-up. Also, this tea is a diuretic, so be prepared to pee like a racehorse shortly after consumption.Overall, I prefer the roasted dandelion root only because it has a deeper/richer taste (and it lends itself well to a splash of cream)--it's more coffee-like--but this offers a nice change of pace."], "A": [0.16576921939849854, 0.04364299774169922, 0.03691451996564865, 0.1630803793668747, 0.09049542993307114, 0.11494645476341248, 0.07137763500213623, 0.12340736389160156, 0.09864009916782379, 0.07096510380506516, 0.02076081559062004]}
