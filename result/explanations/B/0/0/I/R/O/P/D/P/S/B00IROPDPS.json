"], "reviews": ["I got this for my wife and she has been using about ten day's(night's actually) and so far she like's the smoother skin aspect of it. The first few day's she said it dried her skin out, or felt like it. Now she is very happy with the moisturizing effect it has. She also uses the day time version. I think she has found her favorite!", "Today I received the Protege Resurface Cream free of charge for my honest Review. The Protege Resurface Cream arrived very well packaged in a box wrapped in bubble wrap and the jar comes in a very nice grey fabric pouch.  I first applied the cream to my clean face I noticed it had a pleasant light fragrance and how thick it was, the yellow Cream took a while to absorb, but when it did my face was very soft and did not have a shine. The Premium Formula delivers superb results overnight and is said to be the most effective over night cream for under $ 100.00. You should wake up looking and feeling younger Revitalized an Recharged and Protected. There is a Complete Money Back Guarantee if you are not satisfied with this product. You can purchase Protege Resurface Cream on Amazon or the Protege Beauty Website.  Thank you for reading my Review. Jerri Davis", "This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! It is anti-aging, anti-oxidant.  It comes in a jar! It's very thick and rich. I have normally oily skin, prone to monthly-ish breakouts, and somewhat sensitive to changing products but this stuff is amazing. It's not greasy on my skin at all. It has CoQ10, Ceremide E, lutien, lycopene and all kinds of good stuff. Very light fragrance, like Shea butter, no irritation.  I really like this stuff and my skin is softer and smoother. I'll update after  a few months!", "I've been very impressed with all the Protege products I've tried.  The Vitamin A serum, especially, is fabulous, and using this cream in conjunction with the serum produces amazing results!There's a lot of good stuff in this cream.  It's not mayonnaise gooey; it's absorbed quickly and immediately makes skin smoother.  It's not a face lift in a jar, but it does make a definite difference.  I've been using it nightly for almost a month, and my deeper lines are noticeably improved.  I have high hopes for continued use.I received a jar of ResurFACE for honest review, and I'm probably going to purchase another jar when this one is gone.  There is no higher praise!", "I've tried a lot of different creams and moisturizers, and the first thing I noticed about this one was that it looked cheap. The label and container are not particularly striking or interesting. The product also came with a cheap-looking bag, but I don't have any use for it.The print was so tiny I had to remove my glasses and look at the directions and ingredients under a lamp. Hint: It's not youngsters who are buying a restoration cream.Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by the how little of the product I needed to use. I use it at bedtime and only need a very small amount.I've had no reaction to the cream, and I'm pleased with how clear and soft my face is in the morning.So, despite having no bells and whistles, this is an excellent product and a great value.NOTE: I received a sample from the company in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "I've used other Protege products and loved them all -This is a very nice  thick cream but not too thick - goes on very nice - a little goes a long way - my skin feels softer and tighter and I will continue to use and hopefully turn back the time a little bit more!", "As I age, my skin has become drier and as a result I am constantly on the lookout for effective moisturizers.  I don't like to pay the exorbitant prices for department store creams, yet the drugstore creams leave a lot to be desired.This product is wonderful!  I am so happy that I found this.Why I love this product:* It works.  I love how my skin feels smoother and moisturized.  Yet, it's not too heavy or greasy.* The nice texture.  It feels so nice that I am tempted to use more, but the instructions say that only a little bit is needed.  They are right!* No smell.  So many creams are ruined for me because they have such a heavy, unpleasant artificial smell.  This cream has no smell so it's perfect.* The cute little pouch it comes in.  I feel like I just spent lots of money at a high end department store.  For me, using a skin cream is about more than the actual cream; it's the whole experience.  With this cream, I feel very pampered.I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to have better looking skin!I received a free sample of this product, in exchange for an honest review.", "I just started using this and I already feel the difference!  My skin has been dry for some time and within just a few days, there was a huge difference.  I love that this product has no odor and doesn't feel heavy or greasy!  I am really happy with it!!!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12597234547138214, 0.12484007328748703, 0.12177698314189911, 0.10977659374475479, 0.1322106420993805, 0.1293441355228424, 0.13223794102668762, 0.12384127825498581]]}
