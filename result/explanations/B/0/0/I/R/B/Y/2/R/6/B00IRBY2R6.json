"], "reviews": ["This pleasant salt bath smells terrific.  My wife and daughters loved the scent immediately.  The floral scent is natural, subtle yet noticeable, and strikes a chord right away.  Sample provided.", "This is an interesting twist on the typical bath salts in that it includes milk proteins. No, you won&#8217;t be tempted to bring some cereal along when you&#8217;re taking a bath, but rather the milk, plus the added oils (see ingredient list below) takes the edge off the typical skin drying nature of bath salts.The lavender scent is nice &#8211; not too strong, but enough that it&#8217;s clearly there and pleasant. The grains are small and dissolve readily. The ingredients are:Dead Sea SaltMilk proteinsCalcium LactateFD&C; coloringFragranceVitamin E oilAlmond oilOlive oilChamomile extractThe label states that it is made in the US from local and imported ingredients.It&#8217;s not as rigorous of a salt treatment as others I&#8217;ve used, but the mild nature is a nice change, and more relaxing.The only downsides is that it is a bit pricey compared with other Dead Sea salt soaks I&#8217;ve used, and the packaging is pretty basic &#8211; just a simple plastic tub with a screw-off lid. It&#8217;s practical packaging, but not what I&#8217;d call elegant or &#8220;gifty&#8221; if you&#8217;re looking to give this as a gift. But, it remains a nice treat for yourself![Sample provided for review]", "There is nothing that I like better than the scent of lavender, so much so that I surround myself with it whenever possible.  Used in aromatherapy for relaxation and stress relief, I've also been using lavender for over fifteen years for migraine relief.  For me it works faster than any drug - without the side effects.  Thus, I was delighted when I was offered the thisLavender Dead Sea Salts & Milk Bath Soakto try.  After weeks of back and forth to the hospital,  a couple of nights ago I decided that I deserved a good long soak in a real bath (if I never see another shower again it might be too soon!) and that this would be the perfect addition.While my well earned bath did leave my skin nice and soft, I was surprised that this one container (16 ounces) holds only enough soak for two baths. (A single bath requires an entire cup of the soak.)  The bath was neither rich nor creamy.  In fact, the soak simply disappeared into the water. Worse, I also found myself confused by the marked lack of that spectacular lavender scent. My soak had no particular odor at all, never mind lavender.  The only distinguishable ingredient that I could either see or smell was powdered milk.Grandma's $0.02 -  There is a difference between high end and simply expensive.  I'm hoping that the problems I saw with this bath soak are simply a one-off quality control issue, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stock this in my bathroom.Your call.", "On opening the jar, I smelled a very pleasant aroma of soap and a mild lavender scent. My wife took her bath with a cup of the salts added to the bath water, and the warm water seemed to release more of the lavender scent, turning her bath into almost an aromatherapy session. She liked the way her skin felt after getting out of the bath and drying off.I found a different use for the bath salts. I recently had minor surgery on one of my big toes. The healing has taken longer than I expected, which concerned me just a bit, since I'm diabetic. I've been soaking my foot in a tub of warm water and epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), which feels good and is supposed to help the healing. One night, I added a heaping tablespoon of the lavender Dead Sea salts to the water. I can't say that it made any big difference, but it did feel good, and the skin on my toes felt a bit softer afterward.The recommended amount to use for a bath is one cup, and the jar contains about two cups, so using the recommended amount, you'll get two baths from a 16-ounce jar.A product sample was provided for review purposes.", "I really love the scent of lavender and I love to soak in a tub. This tub has a nice mixture of ingredients to help relax away a stressful day. Admittedly it is not the best soak, it disappears really quickly and offers mild skin conditioning. It smells wonderful in the jar but the lavender scent dissipates fairly quickly once it's dissolved. This jar is good for two full baths but you can use it for multiple foot or hand soaks. I like using it for my feet which leaves them soft and ready for a little exfoliating.I was provided a sample for testing out.", "I'm a busy Mom who doesn't have time to soak in the tub very often.  So when I decide it's time for a long soaky bath with a locked door and a good book, I like to make it as decadent as possible by adding bath salts to the water.I had the opportunity to sneak away for a long bath last weekend and added a cup of this product to the hot water.  Almost immediately the entire bathroom smelled wonderfully of lavender!  The water was slightly milky and slippery, and I could feel my stress draining away as I sunk down into the water and let the ingredients do their magic.  Once I grudgingly got out of the bath, I could see that my skin was soft, and hydrated, and especially the patch of eczema on my elbow was calmed and happy.  I don't know if it was the salt or the milk, but I felt relaxed, clean and pampered.  I was also happy to see that the tub rinsed out without any greasy residue.The label says that in addition to the salt and milk, the bath soak contains vitamin E, olive oil, almond oil (all great for your skin), chamomile (helps calm skin issues) and lavender for its relaxing aromatherapy qualities.  I feel that this product is a little overpriced, as the jar only contains enough for two baths.  I often use plain epsom salts for my soaks, which is quite a bit cheaper.I received a complimentary sample of Lavender Dead Sea Salts and Milk Bath Soak for testing and review purposes.", "This Dead Sea Salt & Milk lavender mineral bath soak from OLELY transforms a hot bath into a spa.  A half-hour of of soaking in it leaves me feeling relaxed and renewed.The formula contains lavender essential oil and chamomile extract, which give the hot water and steamy air a wonderful scent that calms the mind.Mineral salts from the Dead Sea;  milk proteins;  calcium lactate;  and vitamin E, almond, and olive oils soothe irritated skin and leave it soft and silky, without pruning.Afterwards, I enjoy a quick rinse under the shower followed by a pot of tea and a manicure and pedicure.A sample was provided for review by OLELY."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1570824831724167, 0.16920575499534607, 0.11838505417108536, 0.13132736086845398, 0.15787170827388763, 0.15004880726337433, 0.11607884615659714]]}
