"], "reviews": ["I had never tried a hyaluronic acid serum before so I didn't know what to expect when I was sent a sample of this.  This is very thick so that instead of using the included dropper to get it out, I use the dropper as a dip stick to take out and rub on my finger.  This is thick but not sticky or greasy.I spread about three drops of this over my face and it soaks in immediately and leaves my skin looking hydrated.  My pores almost disappeared, my skin looked plumped up, and felt moist.  I couldn't tell I had put anything at all on my face.  The serum disappeared into my skin.  My skin just looked and felt moist and smooth and soft.  Very strange.  I've never used anything like this before. Usually you can see and feel whatever you've put on your skin.I've been using my VoilaVe Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my face, followed by my VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil, and the combination is wonderful.  The hyaluronic acid plumps and feeds moisture to my skin, and the Rosehip Oil seals it in without me being able to tell I put anything on my skin that I can feel.  I won't use any type of oil if it is greasy at all on my face, as that can clog my pores. I also don't like feeling anything on my facial skin.I've been very impressed with all three of the products I've tried from this company.  I can't see the tiny lines under my eyes or on my forehead after I smooth this and the rosehip oil on them.  These products work better than any of the multitude of expensive creams I've tried and I'm amazed.  These are super high quality skin food products at reasonable prices.  I also use this on the back of my hands and throat area and they are excellent.  I'm quite pleased with this.*Note that a free sample was sent to me for review", "First of all, I have been using hyaluronic acid for a while.  I had received a recomendation from my dermatologist and so I did my research and yes .. ton's of stuff out there about all the benefits.  I have tried other products but was looking for a change ... a friend of mine recommended the line by VoilaVe and I got several products ... I am just in love! My skin has improved dramatically since I started using this 100% pure product.  I had a fine line on the side of my mouth and it is practically gone .. then when I had ear surgery I suffered facial paralysis for a while and it left deep lines on my forehead ... again dramatically improved .. and I never thought that could happen.  I love this product .. will continue using it and give it a high recomendation.  I have written other reviews for this company because I have fallen in love.  And I have tried so many others .. many others that are more expensive (for no reason).", "I have used hyaluronic serums and some seem to help and some, not so much. So I am familiar with what to expect.  This is the  real deal. Similar to something I might expect from a dermatologist. It leaves my face soft and much smoother after even the first application than other serums I have used. Since I have begun using hyaluronic serum the discolorations have diminished and my lines and wrinkles are smoother.  I expect significant results from this product. I use it in conjunction with the VoilaVe Rose Hip oil, which I love  First I apply the hyaluronic serum and wait 5-15 mins. and then apply the rose hip oil.  While the oil is oil, it absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin looking smooth and fresh.  Makeup applies well over these products. Fast shipping, good customer service.", "I am loving this Hyaluronic Acid Serum! I am applying it in the morning and at night and my skin feels so much smoother! I also think it looks more smooth and plump! It takes a very small amount to cover you face and neck. I know the word acid could kind of scare someone off, but it does not burn at all. It is a very cooling gel. I have very sensitive skin. Only con I found is in the packaging, it is not that the packaging is real bad, I just wished it came with a pump dispenser.", "This product left my skin feeling great..there was no oily film left behind it soaked right into my skin and left it feeling silky smooth will order again", "I received a bottle of this serum for review purposes.  I noticed almost right away that my skin was softer in areas that I applied the serum. I really like the way it makes my skin feel.", "A great Hayalronic Acid Serum that doesn't irritate the skin.  It has a thick consistency that makes it easy to apply and distribute evenly over the face.", "I really like this serum.  I am very cautious of what I put on my skin and I read about a product before I use it.  I did not have any worries with this product.  It leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  I had an event I went to an people were remarking about how beautiful my skin was and that I was glowing and wanted to know what I was doing.  You know sometimes you don't want to share your secrets but this is such an awesome product that I didn't mind sharing.  The product is not to thin or heavy it is just right.  No over powering scent and it is just lovely.  I would recommend this product to others.", "I love hyaluronic acid for my skin. It does more than just moisturize your skin it actually helps heal wounds. This is a high quality Hyaluronic Acid Serum, 100% pure!! I was lucky enough to get this on the sale price! It goes on feeling a little on the slimy side but soaks up quickly leaving the skin feeling moisturized.", "I gave this to my sister as she is really into the anti aging thing. She applied it to her face for a few days and told me she did see and feel a difference.  Her skin is softer now and some of the fine lines of her wrinkles are starting to fade. Not all the way but very notiiceable.  I had her send me a pic via cell phone as she lives far away and I could tell it was working. I had just visited her a few weeks prior so I can see the difference. Now I am going to get some of this serum for myself since I used her as a test subject. lol!", "Received this product in a very fast manner. This product delivers everything I expected and then some. Have been using product for about 7 days now and skin looks so radiant and youthful. So happy with the results thus far.", "This is the first time using a Hyaluronic on my skin. It felt so amazing! I will be using this in place of other products!", "Awesome product!  I am in love with this product.  it works amazingly fast.  My skin is glowing and Feels much healthier.  I used this for only a few weeks and my skin felt amazing.", "This product is very thick --- takes just a few drops to cover your face and neck.  Absorbs pretty much immediately and really does leave your skin looking and feeling refreshed after the first application!  Very light/clean scent (barely there - but pleasant) - not greasy at all... I am looking forward to the longer term difference that this serum will make - but, my initial impression is very positive!", "Thus Serum Works great for my fine lines. It absorbs nicely! Love it!", "Hyaluronic acid is a critical component of the skin structure and our bodies actively use it to repair and replace protein strutures damaged by age or exposure to the sun.This viscous hyaluronic acid serum from Voil&agrave;Ve contains only the essential ingredients, including purified water, both high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexylglycerin.  It will quickly plump and moisturize the skin and it improves the appearance of fine wrinkles when used regularly over time.The serum should be applied after bathing or washing the face for best effect.  I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face, but also on my elbows and other delicate spots.  It is completely non-irritating, even on the driest skin.The 1 oz. (30 ml) amber bottle has a dropper cap for ease of use.  A few drops will go a long way, so the bottle will last for quite some time.Voil&agrave;Ve provided a review sample for evaluation.  I like the simple formula and the effect it has on my skin and definitely recommend it.", "If you've been on the fence as to whether or not to order this, JUMP NOW!Start with a clean damp face AND neck, put some  on your fingers, pat them together , and quickly cover your face, neck, and eye area.don't neglect your neck! It seals in all that moisture and plumps up your skin very wellpleased with this serum!!!!My fine laugh lines are plumped and my skin feels so healthy , even toned not blotchy!this product is not greasy absorbs well...didn't give me any allergic reactions ...good stuff..I already love their Argan oil  and mixed it with this serum ...worked out great !", "I am in love. This product works so well! My face is so smooth and clear looking. My skin is very sensitive so using products like this can often just cause more irritation. This was not the case here.", "You will really see a huge difference after a few uses. Plus, in the long run it will keep your skin from ever aging or becoming damaged. That sounds awesome to me! I mean, if you can prevent damage and keep your youth for years to come by slowing down the aging process, than it must be a winner.The bottle is perfect size for carrying along on a trip or just to keep at home. The droplet bottle makes it easy to get a small amount and apply all over the areas you really want to fix. All you need is a thin layer and massage it into the skin.It doesn't burn or in my case, haven't given me any type of reaction.  Right away, you will notice the skin hydrating and plumping up. After the first use, your also going to notice the softness to your skin it gives.It really is a great product and with further uses, it will prove to transform your skin and bring back your youth!", "One of the first things I noticed about this product was that it said &#8220;Professional Moisturizing Serum&#8221; and that it has High and Low Molecular weight. That intrigued me, so I saw that the low and high molecular weights actually help the product to work better and increase the penetration of hydration.I&#8217;ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums before, but this is the only one I&#8217;ve seen that has the high and low molecular weights. It&#8217;s also the thickest formula I&#8217;ve seen yet. I was quite amazed at how thick the product was, and yet how incredibly fast it absorbed into my skin; it was almost instantaneous.I only needed a few of the thick drops to cover my face and it absorbed very fast. It also left absolutely no residue or greasy feeling to my skin. It actually worked incredibly well at hydrating my skin and left my face feeling softer.Another thing I noticed about this product is that it felt very nice and cool and I almost want to say &#8220;tingly&#8221; when it smoothed on my face. It felt very nice. I had no problems using other products on my face and it works perfect under makeup.I think this is my new favorite serum! I use it twice a day and have noticed such a great improvement in my skins overall appearance. I&#8217;m very happy with this product!", "This Hyaluronic Acid Serum came in a 1 fl oz dark brown bottle that helps keep light out and extends the life span.It has a black liquid dropper top for easy application. I can get a drop or two out easily and this is really all I need when I apply it to my face. This product is a thick gel, very similar to Aloe Vera Gel. It is a bit thicker than other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have tried. It has no scent to it and it isn't sticky. It is easily absorbed by my skin and yes it does hydrate my skin after using the Vitamin C Serum.I'm happy that this particular product has no fillers, parabens, alcohol, fragrance and is cruelty free. It doesn't irritate my skin at all. It doesn't leave any kind of residue on my face either, which is great. I can use this under my makeup and also before I go to bed.I really like this product.Is it superior to the other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past?Honestly, although I do like this product, I don't see much of a difference from the others. They all seem to do about the same.My skin feels smooth and soft afterward, and is looking healthier, as with the others.As a product tester I was sent a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.", "I really like it. Makes my skin soft and smooth. Very lovely. Non- greasy after it oaks in. Hyaluronic acid is in Restylane and Juvederm.  Hopefully it helps topically as well.", "What a great serum - my wife loves it - She has  tried other products by VoilaVe and she has never been disappointed -she absolutely loves it - has helped with fine lines and puffiness around her eyes - skin feels velvety soft..according to my wife you won't be disappointed.", "I've been reading on the newest & best treatments for middle aged skin & this is it. Low & high molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It hydrates & plumps without fillers, parabens, alcohol, or fragrance. The articles I read also recommended a dark glass bottle with dropper for application. Happy with the product & the price.", "Just what the doctor ordered for my uneven skin tones!  I was always conscious of my uneven skin tones on my face.  This product is working wonders.  I have noticed a big difference already.  And a little dab will do ya with this product.  So it lasts quite a long time too.", "I received a free sample to review in exchange for my honest opinion.The hyaluronic acid serum surprised my expectations.  The only other time I have used hyaluronic acid was as a peel.  This serum is different in that I it does not sting when applied and I don&#8217;t have to wash it off after a half hour on my skin.The serum can be used twice a day, but I am using it in the evening.  My skin looks healthy, supple and glowing!  My skin has less fine lines showing and I feel more confident with my aging skin as I don&#8217;t look or feel my age.", "This product is wonderful. It is a great moisturizer and skin conditioner.  Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a great serum to put on the skin and this one is 100% pure, which means I am putting the best stuff on my skin I can. I used to wake up with puffiness under my eyes.  The morning after I tried this serum, the puffiness was almost gone under my eyes with just one use.  I have been using it for over a week now, and I am amazed how my skin looks. I can really see a difference in my skin since I started using this product. I did not know that Hyaluronic Acid Serum could produce these kind of results and this serum is 100% pure, so I know I am putting the best of the best on my skin with VoilaVe.", "I've been using this product for only a few days, but my husband says he can already tell the difference.  Its definitely helped with the tone of my skin so it is not so blotchy as it was.  My skin feels soft and smooth!  I love it!", "So many skin care products and anti aging products contain hyaluronic acid serum. It is used in many products like lip glosses, serums, creams, tinted creams, eye-shadows and many other makeup products. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant and hydrating properties and so it is used in so many skin care and makeup products. Hyaluronic acid serum is hydrating, moisturizing, and keeps my skin feeling soft.  Gives a dewy glow to it. Helps skin appear more plump and skin tone appears more even. Love that this product is 100% pure. Small amounts go a long way, with a very light scent. Easy and smooth to apply. Apply normal moisturizer over it. I apply twice a day. Taking care of my ski is important and I've noticed a difference since using this serum."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.032543983310461044, 0.03395320102572441, 0.03185295686125755, 0.03716525807976723, 0.03627077117562294, 0.03377924859523773, 0.039236657321453094, 0.03489712253212929, 0.035544250160455704, 0.03344632685184479, 0.03546127304434776, 0.037139564752578735, 0.03736629709601402, 0.03423185274004936, 0.0359412282705307, 0.02781754545867443, 0.03638416528701782, 0.03468102961778641, 0.02968400903046131, 0.031913671642541885, 0.02967827580869198, 0.035439733415842056, 0.033347174525260925, 0.0334831066429615, 0.035761795938014984, 0.034077275544404984, 0.04178125783801079, 0.034381408244371414, 0.03273959085345268]]}
