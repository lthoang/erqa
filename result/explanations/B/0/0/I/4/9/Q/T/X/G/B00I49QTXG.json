"], "reviews": ["Although it would be some time before you determined that the infrared heat prevents damage, it is good to know that the feature is available. This is an attractive hair drying tool, and I like that it feels lightweight.Yes, the drying time is quicker, and I like that it includes the diffuser for close-up and/or specific areas.  This handles easy, and yes, sometimes we could always appreciate longer cords.  This make it easy to work on another person's hair.Another feature I use is the locking cold.  This is great, just to blow away cut hair pieces.  The heating element is 1875 watts and  that is quite hot if needed.Nice, sleek styling tool, easy to use, easy to use on others!  Rizzo", "Given my usage, this may seem odd. But I got this for my modeling and painting, which its been very helpful with for a lot of the same reasons. The cord is long enough I don't have to use an extension to get it to where I need it, and the fan and the heating coils warm up and are steady enough that I don't have any problems with uneven drying, and it also cools down fast enough I don't scorch anything I set it on or scald my hands if I accidentally touch a part of it after I finish using it. Very nice design with easy to use controls.", "I'm giving this five stars because it has the most powerful motor I have ever had as well as the incredible range of controls for it. Usually, even the best have just two power settings: low and high. This has a medium. Add to that the various temperature settings and the only way it could be better is if you could program it to float in the air above your head. Excellent.", "\"The Nexxus Salon Hair Care dryer is a compact and surprisingly powerful machine.  The \"\"Italian AC Motor\"\" and air tunnel are encased in an off-white plastic tapering tube 8.5in long, 3.25 in. in diameter at its widest point. The 4.5 in. long handle is curved to fit the hand (right or left hand). A heavy rubber cover protects the electric cord extending from bottom of the handle so excessive wear due to dryer changes in angle can be avoided. The cord is 6 ft. 4 in. long. The 110 V plug has built in test/reset buttons that act as a circuit breaker if the cord gets too hot. The unit has not overheated while operating the device since I got it.The motor is very powerful, blowing air with high power. The tapered tube of the blower has effective \"\"Ionic Technology\"\" that helps prevent \"\"frizz,\"\" a factor I have had some experience with after testing another dryer two years ago. The end of the blower tube has Titanium Ceramic technology that produces \"\"infrared heat\"\" that I have found does not burn the hair with normal use.There are two attachments for the end of the dryer tube. One is a \"\"concentrator,\"\" a 3.5 in. wide black plastic funnel with a flattened air exit. This produces an air stream that is wider but more concentrated than the blower tube without the attachment. The second attachment is a round plastic \"\"Diffuser\"\" 6 in. in diameter that spreads the air out through eighteen 1.25 in. teeth. This works well with long hair to fluff up the hair and create curls and waves.The hand controls can be operated easily for left or right handers. There are two black oblong rocker buttons and one round button. The lower black button controls motor speeds: off, low, and high. The upper black button controls air temperature: cool, warm, and hot. The round button set high on the handle is an off/on cold button. With one push and release the machine will blow cold air without changing the temperature setting controlled by the upper black button. A second push and release of the round button will return the air to the setting of the upper black button.My wife uses the Nexxus dryer frequently and likes the machine very much. We asked a friend, a hair salon owner, to try it out in her shop. She likes the power of the machine, the functioning of the handle controls, and the effectiveness with her styling work.I highly recommend the Nexxus Salon Hair Care dryer for its compact design, powerful motor, and functionality for personal and professional use.\"", "This is an excellent styling blower. The air flows out in a massive, evenly-heated gust. The motor provides the perfect level of heat to dry hair in any style, with one-button cool air flow for setting.This unit provides three heat settings to administer from either of two speed settings. It includes a concentrator attachment, as well as a large diffuser that makes short work of voluminous hair.I love that my Nexxus styling dryer is lightweight. I enjoy its comfortably balanced grip. It has a long, well-reinforced cord with a test and reset buttons on the supply.One of my favorite features of my Italian Motor Styling Tool, besides its outstanding performance, is the addition of the rubber feet on each side of the dryer, which keep the dryer from sliding off of the vanity as readily as other dryers that I have used in the past; it's such a simple thing, but small features such as this go a long way in the overall satisfaction with a product.At the rear intake, the cover may be removed with an easy counter-clockwise rotation for cleaning. The quality of the unit seems to have been manufactured with exceptional precision. The painted, rigid fins of the blower outlet seem immune to the typical wear of the bathroom environment. Attachments clip in firmly, yet they are easily changed.The motor noise generated by using this blower is more tolerable than that of the typical inexpensive dryers. The large, constant flow of air throughout its properly formed chamber is nowhere near as pitchy as the desperate pull noise produced by lower quality models - it makes a warmer tone.This is an amazing tool, that provides efficient drying and styling power. The even air temperatures are perfect. There is no scorching heat like that emitted from the toaster-in-a-tube dryers. I highly recommend the Nexxus Italian AC Motor Styling Tool for achieving perfect results, without any of the damage that the extreme-temperature units tend to do to hair.", "A very powerful hair dryer - uh, I mean &#34;Styling Tool&#34; :)It dries fast and the attachments are a great bonus.  I never would have thought to attribute lack of frizz or hair health with a dryer, but it seems to leave hair in better shape than other dryers.  Not sure if it's the &#34;Ionic technology&#34; they speak of, but it's nice.  The long cord and the non-slip nub on the sides point out an attention to detail that is a nice touch.  The description claims 3x the life based on their &#34;Italian Motor&#34; etc.  If that's the case, this would be a great value.  A lot of power and features for a long time is a good combo.", "This is a very well made and well functioning dryer.  It is a little heavier than my old dryer and while the noise level seems about the same this one is much lower pitched which I prefer.  It does a good and quick job.  My daughter and I both like it.", "I have been a fan of ionic technology ever since I read about an ionic pet brush in the Sky Mall catalog on a trip. I have also owned a Sharper Image ionic hair dryer for years. I am a believer in the ionic technology and it works just as well in both hair dryers.The one advantage the Sharper Image dryer has is that it is a little quieter. This dryer is pretty loud, but it dries amazingly fast. Even though it dries fast it doesn't seem to overheat my hair.This dryer also looks sharp with the white plastic and black cord and the slim handle fits well in my hand. It comes with a giant diffuser, which is interesting, and a pinpoint styler.This dryer is a nice upgrade over my old dryer. The only drawback is the increased noise, although I won't have to listen to it for long because this dryer dries about 3 times faster.", "The Nexxus Italian Motor Styling Tool does a stellar job of drying and styling my hair. I love how fast I can dry my hair with this product. Needing less time with the blow dryer which gives me more time with the curling iron and/or flat iron. It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser. It's one sweet looking product with it's pearl white finish makes it as lovely as it is practical.", "\"I like to get the safety warnings out of the way first (really, that's what they say).I've owned lots of Conair products over the years but nothing this expensive. In this case you really do get what you pay for. Everything about the dryer says \"\"quality\"\". It is very well balanced and the ergonomic handle fits the palm perfectly with the buttons near the fingertips not under the palm where so many cheap designs locate them. Positive detent between button selections. The \"\"cool\"\" selection works for setting your style before removing curlers. Heavy-duty cord with an ALCI plug which is a very nice safety feature. Double lint screens on the back. The outer one slips off easily for cleaning. The concentrator is great for select sections of hair like bangs. The diffuser  is almost the size of VW hubcap and takes a little getting used to but once you do if works great for fine, curly hair. It doesn't leave your hair looking like a dandelion puff-ball.The pearl finish is a very classy look. Five year limited warranty. Coupon included for 3 oz size Nexxus shampoo and conditioner.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12595219910144806, 0.10137853026390076, 0.10356029123067856, 0.07207533717155457, 0.08044049888849258, 0.1157817542552948, 0.11067546159029007, 0.08639273047447205, 0.10382983088493347, 0.09991338849067688]]}
