Easy, fast setup and navigation, with great performance.", "I have an Acer C720 which I absolutely love and decided to get the Asus Chromebox for a desktop computer. I have it mounted on the back of my monitor. It's silent quiet, very small, has many ports, but most of all it just works and works quickly. Starts up in about 7 seconds and shuts down it about 2. From sleep mode it connects to the internet instantly and surfs very quickly. I create and edit office documents, watch movies, listen to my music, edit my photos, use Evernote, and Google Keep, use Dropbox, check my calendar, and just about everything else I do (or did) on my windows computer. It's been the most trouble and frustration free computer experience I've ever had. To think that these Chrome devices cost less than $200 (when Amazon actually has them in stock), I doubt I'll ever spend more than that again.", "I ordered one of these instead of waiting for the LG All in One Chromebase.  My Linux and Microsoft units have been donated and a Chromebook has been acquired.  I liked my first Chromebox so much, I ordered another, one for each of my homes.These tiny units are so much faster than anything I have owned and attached to the back of my previous computers monitors, in effect giving me virtual all-in-one units.  With 8 hours of battery (ACTUAL 8 HRS) life with the Chromebook is fantastic for keeping in touch when I travel.  I sync to my google drive and all my stuff is available to me wherever I am.  Not having to worry about updating the OS and antivirus programs is another bonus.You can't beat these little computers at anything close to this price point.  I completely replaced my hardware for less than I paid for 1 Windows unit.  Put that in your Microsoft and smoke it.", "If you live in Google ecosystem this is for you! Best computer purchase to date! Everything is web based these days so Chromebox covers 99% of our needs as a main desktop!It is everything Windows systems are not: fast, simple, bulletproof, quiet,.... I just wished Chrome OS was supported by Skype since that is how we keep in touch with family overseas. No doubt it will be added at some point.We built a perfect Chromebox setup through Amazon:  HP X4000b Bluetooth Mouse (H3T51AA#ABC), Logitech K810 Bluetooth Illuminated Keyboard, Asus VS239H IPS 23In monitor. I also use Logitech Sphere webcam and my surround sound. Everything works absolutely perfect. System is on instantly! I think it takes longer for monitor to wake up and display picture through HDMI than for Chromebox to boot up!FYI: on initial power up you need USB or wireless mouse and keyboard to enable Bluetooth option for Bluetooth keyboard and mouse!!! After that they are on and I had no issues or needs to pair them again. Buy quality peripherals from reputable manufacturers!We love this thing!", "For the price you can surf the net without worry cause this Asus has you covered.Snappy performance and updated browser and no security worries makes this part of your internet experience.Have mine hooked up to the 55 inch Vizio.Went into settings and set my fonts and page size up.Hooked up the Logitech K400 and it worked flawlessly.Flash and HTML5 ran great!Do yourself a favor and purchase one to hook up to your big screen!", "This computer replaced my aging computer running Linux Mint.  I have had The Asus Chromebox for a week and went to all of my websites, minor issue is a couple websites video start's pixelated for the first 5 to 10 seconds and then everything looks and sounds great, but 95% of the time there is no pixelation issue.  Also, I have had this Chromebox connected via HDMI to my 46&#34; Samsung TV and all four sides are cropped off, so you would not see the back button, tab bar, etc.  I tried all four of my TV's HDMI ports with the same issue.  The workaround is to go into Chome OS setting and manually  adjust the image which lowers the resolution or go into the TV settings and change video from 16x9 to &#34;fit screen&#34;, I ended adjusting the setting on the TV and now the screen looks good, I wonder if that lowers the resolution? YMMV good for you if you don't have this issue.Asus Chromebox does not have a setting to adjust the screen saver, well because it does not have one :)  And you cannot adjust when the monitor turns off.  But I found a easy work around, install Webview Screensaver and SimpleExtManager at the Chrome Store.  Go into SimpleExtManager and make a group with just the Webview Screensaver that way you can easily toggle the screensaver on and off.The Asus Chromebox is cheap, has low end hardware, and this linux distro is a work in progress as Google is adding new features to Chrome OS all the time :)  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, just remember you get what you pay for.Sooooo, which one to buy? You got this one, the Asus Chromebox with the i3 variant, or you could roll you own with a NUC with the same i3 and add Linux Mint or Ubuntu.  If you don't know what a Ubuntu is then forget the NUC and if you don't have a 4K compatible TV/monitor and receiver, then forget the Asus i3 variant.NOTE: I did not drink too much Google Kool-aid or Haterade when writing this review, just the facts ma'am.", "Pro: Easy setupPro: Fast start upPro: Fast shutdownPro: Every website I tried worked properlyPro: Works with a HDMI to VGA converterCon: Poorly designed power adapterI got this for my mother who had a very old and slow hand-me-down laptop I got while in college. It's been several years since college and I wanted to get her something affordable that would work for email, internet games, and documents/spreadsheets. I gave this Chromebox a try and I am very happy.This Chromebox blows away my expectations. It's got some very low powered technical specs so I was hesitant to get it thinking it would be terribly slow. I was very wrong. This thing boots up in seconds and it able to browse websites and play games far better and faster than that old laptop. It isn't a gaming machine powerhouse, but it can do the web based games that my mom likes to play.I was a little concerned about setting it up for my mom since I am not familiar with the chrome operating system. All she had to do was create a GMail account with google and connect to Wi-Fi to start using the system. I was all prepared to spend an hour working with her through prompts to get going. I couldn't be any happier about how easy this setup was. I didn't have to look for drivers for the mouse keyboard or monitor.I want to point it's quiet. I didn't even notice any fan noise coming out of the thing. If it has a fan it's certainly far quieter than that old laptop.If you have an old VGA Monitor, Don't worry since you can purchase a cheap HDMI to VGA converter. I purchased one from Amazon for around ten bucks. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C0Y6BQG/ref=oh_details_o09_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1It works flawlessly for me.I have one negative to say about this Chromebox. It has a poorly designed power adapter. The power adapter is a big rectangle which has the plugs lined up with the length of the rectangle. This causes the adapter to either have to be last thing plugged into the power strip or it takes up multiple outlets. They could have rotated the plug prongs 90 degrees to fix this issue. This is absolutely a very minor issue and doesn't affect the overall rating of this great product.", "I love this computer. It is kind of funny to call it that though because of how small it is. But that's not a bad thing especially since it comes with a mount and screws to put on the back of a monitor or maybe even a wall. It runs very fast and is dead silent. Also it stays very cool even after being on for hours. Another thing I should add is that since this is Chrome OS I wasn't too sure if I had to get a keyboard and mouse specific for it. But every keyboard and mouse I got for it works perfectly fine ( I mainly use the Logitech K400 ) Another thing is that this computer is not meant for games or for those who want to use this for editing videos, pictures, or anything like that for business. Also you won't even be able to play any games other than browser based games ( Although Need For Speed Worlds is in the app store which I thought was a downloaded game, but I'm not sure since I didn't try to get it ) But if you just want to use this computer for surfing the web, a media player, or for projects ( This doesn't have the well known Microsoft tools but it does have Google Docs which is exactly the same but I'd say a little better with how it saves ) All around it's a good product and I'd recommend.", "So I purchased this to replace an aging PC for my young kids.  Virtually everything they do, they do on the web.  Unfortunately, running Windows, my old hardware was supper doggy.  Even flash sites on the web like Nick Jr. just dragged.  I realized my kids weren't really using any other programs other than Chrome, so when the Chromebox was announced I knew it could be what I needed.  Chrome OS focuses on the web, and providing a superb experience.  The limited reviews I had read led me to believe that the Asus Chromebox would fit the bill.  I definitely considered going the Chromebook route, but they were more expensive, and expansion options were essentially non existent.  The Chromebox however allowed you to expand the memory (up to 16GB as I understand it!!!), and even swap out the SSD (though I doubt I'll need to).  This is really important to me.  If there is anything I've learned from phone (Android and iOS), over time as the OS is updated, things start feeling slow.  I know I can't update the processor, but memory goes a LONG way in defining your experience.  So being able to upgrade was a big deal for me, and the Chromebooks just don't have that option (or very few do anyway).Then add in the fact that this was less than $200, I'm sold.Now, I won't get into the merits or negatives of Chrome OS.  That's why I say its fantastic for what its meant for.  This thing isn't going to compete with the custom build PC I made last year in both power or versatility.  But it does what I need it to VERY well, including some basic parental controls.So if that is your use case, get it.  I really don't think you will be disappointed.", "I purchased this for a family friend whose ancient Windows XP machine was starting to die. They were about 80 and are very far from being good with technology. I was somewhat worried at first they wouldn't understand it, but it was have them use Windows 8 or Chrome, and I wasn't going to try to explain the Metro interface to them.After about 5 minutes of setup they were able to start using it. A few hours later and I had migrated all their old documents into drive, hooked up their cloud printer, and showed them how to use it. It is not a seamless transition, you won't just &#34;learn right off the bat&#34; how to use it, but if you put in some effort over a week you will understand it well. The person I got it for understands it and is enjoying the simicity of the machine. And its pretty fast for what she does with it, which is a nice bonus over her old one.", "I also have an Acer Chromebook so no surprise at how quickly the Box version booted up from out of the box and plug in, sign in, and online.  If the Asus service center was a 10th as good as their products they'd put everyone out of business.  Asus registration does not include the Chromebox type or model therefore trying to register it has included emails, online chats, and a repeat of the process and still not registered.  Probably best to take advantage of Amazon's 3 years warrant for 15 bucks if that concerns you.  The Box picks up where the Book leaves off for a stationary setting.  Works great with my 24&#34; Dell monitor, played several movies from several sources with only a sniff of buffer but only on one or two movies so more likely the feed than anything.  Didn't like using it on my one of my HDTVs and the other didn't adapt to the size correctly but still usable in Chromecast most.  Upgrading to 4 MB of RAM on my laptop made a major difference, not doubt the same for the Box.", "This is a great choice for a desktop at home. Once I hooked it up to a monitor and connected a mouse and keyboard, all has worked well. The Chrome OS has been more resistant to viruses that kids seem to pick up by clicking on certain sites. It boots in seconds and doesn't make a sound.One thing I love is everyone can have their own password sign on that will bring up their bookmarks and favorites. We use this in the kitchen and everyone has an account they can click to get their experience setup in seconds.", "The Chrome OS has come a long way since it was first announced, and I'm using more and more web apps than ever before.  This box really is a great way to take advantage of those converging trends.  I however use this box run XBMC, a powerful and versatile media center that runs real well on this box.I followed one of the many guides online to run OpenELEC, a custom Linux distribution to run XBMC on boxes like this.  The Celeron inside can handle any of my high bit rate 1080p files served on my lan perfectly.  It likewise can handle more advanced skins with aplomb.  The only issue (just to be clear this is specific to running XBMC not the standard Chromebox setup) is Netflix and Amazon, which hardly work at all on XBMC and not really on Linux.  I boot to the standard Chrome OS for those. I haven't had any issues there.The hardware is all rather nice.  The CPU is plenty fast, it stays cool, and the price is hard to beat.", "If you know that Chrome OS is a good match to your own needs, this little box is a great choice.  If you don't even know what Chrome OS is, do some research before plunking down your cash on this little machine.  Don't buy the hype, positive or negative.  I personally like the idea of having most of my file storage in the cloud where its relatively safe.  With a good internet connection, it doesn't take noticeably longer to pull up a file from Google Drive than it does from a local hard drive.  Still, if you need particular productivity applications, Chrome OS might not be for you.  For me, it's a second (and now third) computer.  I still use a tower for heavy lifting like photo editing, music recording, and graphic design.I added an extra 2GB of RAM to mine and it works smoothly as expected.  I plan to add a Linux distro as well.  I've had some issues with wireless peripherals but those problems could have been due to interference since I use this computer with my living room TV.IMPORTANT: If you already have another Chrome device, don't expect to get the free 100GB of Google online storage extended on your account by buying this one.  Apparently, with all Chrome OS devices except for the Pixel, the offer is a one time deal.  I didn't realize that and thought I'd get another two years of data after buying this box.  It can only work if you register it under a different email address.  While I have more than one email address, I don't want to spread my data across several accounts.  It isn't a huge deal given the recent drop in storage prices at Google, but it's worth mentioning.", "I bought this because I wanted to find out what the whole Chrome OS thing was about and how practical it really is.  You can read reviews all day, but there's no substitute for real-world experience.  We recently upgraded our desktop computer with a new fourth-generation i7 and 27&#34; monitor, so I had the old 23&#34; monitor sitting around, and put it to use with the Chromebox.  I added a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard/trackpad, as I have the same model for use with our HTPC and like it.  The only technical issue I found is that the WiFi receiver is not as strong as other devices.  It is a pretty long haul between two buildings to reach my router, and the desktop PC, laptop, and wireless printer don't have any problems.  The Chromebox struggled to acquire and keep the signal so I had to spend another $30 on a TP-Link range extender, which fixed the problem.I'm finding that I can do a whole lot on the Chromebox -- more than I expected.  I make a lot of use of Google services which are, of course, well supported.  I also do a bit using my Microsoft Onedrive and my Outlook account, and those work well on the Chromebox also.  I've tested out the off-line functions just a little bit, and it appears that you really can work off-line with this device if needed (probably not as big a deal as with a Chromebook since that is much more portable).  I know the Chrome OS can do a lot more than I have asked of it so far, and I have just begun to explore the apps and extensions available.  I still have to go back to the desktop PC or the laptop to use Photoshop, Lightroom, and Microsoft Publisher, but for just about everything else I do the Chromebox seems to be up to the task.", "Small in size, but tough and simple, the Chromebox will do all the browsing you could ask for. If you've used a Chromebook before, you know what you're getting yourself into, as it is very much like anything else involving Chrome OS. Speed is sufficient, and the RAM handles the job just fine.The only problem I'm having right now involves the peripherals I'm using with the Chromebox. I'm using a 24&#34; Samsung HDTV with HDMI input, but it's actually extremely big for what I'm doing. I would have been happy using my computer monitor, but the output closest to that is the DisplayPort, which would need a VGA adapter cable, so I'll need to research into that if I can't get used to the current setup. The keyboard is a Microsoft, and the mouse is a Logitech, both of which work excellent; just plugged them both in and they worked right away in cordless fashion. That's right, no drivers needed!If you're on the fence, think about what you do with a computer on a daily basis. Google Chrome's Operating System does not require an antivirus program to bloat up its performance nor keep you safe. So you can rest easy knowing this. The internet on Google Chrome is snappy, and I like that. If you've ever used Google Chrome before, you've already experienced Google Chrome OS. But I wanted something that was incredibly simple to use, without any bloated software or crazy updates. Every update Google pushes out there is important and essential, and not a waste of space. It only takes 5-10 seconds tops for starting up and shutting down, or restarting. If you want to talk games, all of the ones I've played have worked quite well on it. Also, if you're worrying about the lack of Microsoft support for Word/Excel/PowerPoint, they just released an app on the Google App Store for Word Online, which is absolutely cool, and now Excel, more on the way, all for free. You just can't go wrong now; this was a big worry for the Microsofters.It just works! My mom-in-law complains so much about her desktop and laptops, talking to her about the Chromebox is giving her a newfound interest in this product, and I'm hoping to show it off to her because I think it would be the perfect candidate for her."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.005979382898658514, 0.095573790371418, 0.0022837824653834105, 0.16587600111961365, 0.15693816542625427, 0.3203655779361725, 0.0004919627099297941, 0.03038756735622883, 0.02181841991841793, 0.013557100668549538, 0.0008105047745630145, 0.16218414902687073, 0.01862999051809311, 0.00023512245388701558, 0.00021065441251266748, 0.004657845478504896]]}
