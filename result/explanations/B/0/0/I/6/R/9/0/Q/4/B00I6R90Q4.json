"], "reviews": ["\"Update: it looks like the seller has changed the bottle from the droplet applicator to the spray bottle.  I am reducing the rating to 4 star to reflect my preference for the droplet applicator.Original review:I have been using Argan oils for about a year. I have tried bottles with different applicators: spray bottles and bottle with droplets. I found bottle with droplet applicators to be much more convenient both for application (easier not to get oil on things you don't want to get oily) and for controlling the amount you dispense. NYGlow argan oil comes in a 2 oz container (4.75\"\" from the bottom to the top of the cap) with a droplet applicator.NYGlow argan oil is a thin oil that is absorbed well. I began using Argan on daily basis this winter after my hairdresser recommended that I began using argan oil in my hair because she felt the hair on on top of my hair felt dry. She called it \"\"hat hair\"\". She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter. A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy. My hair dresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness. The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look. On my next appointment she said she could see the difference that the hair felt better.This Argan Oil is provided by NYGLOW.Ali Julia review\"", "I do woodworking and it plays havoc on hands.  I also care for children and wash my hands all day long.  my hands are so dry and my cuticles are worse.  I ordered this to help my poor hand situation. It works better than the hand lotions I have been trying.  It does a very good job at repairing the cuticle damage and helping my dry skin.  I am using it on my face and it softens very well and  relaxes and diminishes the wrinkles.  I have been using it to deep condition my hair with good results.  While my hair isnt frizzy, it does have dry ends and this smooths them out for much healthier hair.  Fast shipping, good customer service.", "I&#8217;m a big fan of Argan oil for treating dry skin, especially on my hands. While moisturizers help, Argan oil goes beyond what moisturizers can do not only for soothing dryness, but also helping to heal cracks at my fingertips. Argan oil has worked better than anything else I&#8217;ve tried.After making the conversion to Argan oil I tried a few different brands. To be honest, I don&#8217;t notice any appreciable difference between brands provided they are organic and cold pressed. That combination seems to produce the best quality oil with little scent (other than the normal earthy-type scent of Argan oil). The main issues boil down to price and packaging.Packaging is important since you only need a little bit or Argan oil to get the job done. The NYGlow oil has a nice dispensing system that allows me to use just the amount I want to use without any wastage. It also comes in a brown glass bottle (I much prefer glass over plastic) in a 2 ounce size. The smaller size is more convenient to handle than the usual 4 ounce bottles, plus since you only need a few drops per use, a 2 ounce bottle will still last a long time.Price-wise, this is a bit on the high side, but not as pricey as other brands that come in &#8220;gift-ready&#8221; packaging. But, the price is high enough that I&#8217;ll drop the rating to 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5 since the dispenser is so nicely done).If you've never tried Argan oil, you need to &#8211; this is wonderful for dry skin, is easy to apply, and provides lasting benefits. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]", "\"I use this as a daily moisturizer and its amazing! It makes my skin feel super smooth! I have sensitive skin and allergic to a lot of stuff and this oil didn't give ANY sort of reaction. This oil is great organic and natural product to use! It makes my skin feel so much healthier! Great product that everyone must use!Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application. I don't understand how but Ilove it! This is 100% virgin moroccan Argan oil with no perfumes. If you know your Argan oil you know they are not pleasant smelling unless the have perfumes added. However, after rubbing this into my hair, the odor \"\"magically\"\" disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling scent.Argan oil has made my dry, flaky skin look and feel much better with regular use, and it has even reduced the itching. It has also improved the appearance of my cuticles with regular use. Lately, I have been using it on the dry skin on my feet after I shower, and it softens it and eliminates that ashy appearance. I do use it in my hair because my scalp is really dry, and I have several friends who do.No matter if your hair is thick, dry, frizzy, thick, curly, or just out of control - Argan oil will help. Do some online searches for the many uses of Argan oil. Besides using it \"\"as is\"\" from the bottle, you can use it as a hot oil treatment, skin moisturizer, dry scalp and eczema treatment, treat dry hands and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing. The list can go on and on Courtesy of unfair deals .\"", "This is a glass bottle with a minimalist look. It conveniently comes with a spray pump to dispense the oil.The product has no scent, and I only need to use a small amount to get the desired effects.I use it on my hair, skin, and nails, and I'm very happy with the results.It's nice to buy a beauty/health product that has only one ingredient: 100% Organic Argonia Spinosa Kernel (Argon) Oi.NOTE: I received a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "NYGLOW Argan Oil is a very high quality, organic, cold-pressed oil from the kernel of the seed of the fruit of the Argania spinosa tree, which is native to Morocco. It is packaged in a handy 2 oz. dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a good quality pump that dispenses a large drop, which goes a long way.I enjoy the uniquely earthy, slightly sweet and nutty scent of this natural argan oil. It improves the texture and appearance of dry, flaky skin look, both instantly when applied as well as over time, with repeated use. It is quickly absorbed and locks in moisture, leaving the skin smooth and moist, and not at all greasy. I apply it after bathing and several times during the day.Argan oil is also helpful when used on the cuticles before a manicure or pedicure, and just a few drops massaged into the scalp and hair will lock in moisture and give the hair a natural sheen.A sample was provided by NYGLOW for testing and evaluation.", "This oil is pretty good.It penetrates the hair and scalp and makes my hair feel softer than usual.I use it as a sealant after I've washed deep conditioned.Even my hands feel soft after rubbing it in my hair.Perfect for night.I and my wife are using it for 3 months already.Wrinkles disappear, our skin glow and look healthy without make up.My wife also loves it.Just use few drops night time. It lasts long.Best price.I recommend it highly.", "This argan oil is marketed as USDA Organic.  On the bottle that I received, however, there is no indication that its USDA certified.  So you have to have faith that it actually is and take the manufacturers word for it.Another thing is that this bottle of argan oil does not smell like the rest of the argan oils I have. It smells very slightly like argan oil but not as strong as the others.  It makes me wonder whether its diluted in some way?  It doesn't feel diluted but I can't help but wonder why it smells so faintly of argan oil?The reason I'm still giving it 4 stars despite the above two points is that it works.  I've used it for my hair, nails and skin and it works just as well as the other argan oils I've used that have the USDA certified symbols and smell strongly of argan oil.  So as far as I can tell, those things don't detract from the quality of this oil.In general, I love using argan oil on my hair and body.  I now use it instead of a moisturizer and it works really well.  I love getting everything silky smooth without a single chemical.  It's my new favorite product.I received a sample for review.", "Works great for excessively dry skin and damaged hair!  Makes my skin look and feel wonderful!  My daughter loves it too!", "This Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil is wonderful for hair and skin. It takes only a small amount in the palm of your hand.I  rubbed my palms together and smoothed them over the top of my hair and it made my hair shiny and much softer.It left my hands feeling silky smooth. I also used this for my feet before going to bed and it has really softened myfeet up.I would highly recommend this product."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.09733553975820541, 0.1084844172000885, 0.11121143400669098, 0.09609498828649521, 0.037030186504125595, 0.06973402202129364, 0.10987477004528046, 0.13027231395244598, 0.13002163171768188, 0.10994073748588562]]}
