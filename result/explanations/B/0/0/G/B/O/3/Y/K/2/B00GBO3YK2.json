They are weak in distortion, sound stage and most of all, weak in musical detail.They do not sound bad.  They just sound better than my table radio.  They are good for computer speakers.  They are good for a small room, not for a living room or for outdoors.I forgive the rolled-off highs, the empty bass, but to get the mid-range wrong is too much to get those four stars.  Wireless is nice.  I want true music at this price point. Pioneer did it; not wireless, mind you but lushly accurate.  Look to Audio Engine for better sound. Look to Sonus for better wireless.", "These speakers were a bit of a shock to me.  They are huge!  Well, maybe not huge but they are a lot bigger than I anticipated. They are heavy too.  The first thing I noticed is the exceptional packaging these came in, easily the best packing of anything I've bought.* The buttons on the main speaker are touch sensitive and work to power on, volume and mute.* The required cable between the speakers is fairly long but one concern is the ends are unique, not easily replaced.* The remote is functional but pretty small.* The power supply is a brick so be prepared for an extra box laying around.* Bluetooth was virtually automatic with my sons tablet and sounded good.Of course, what is important is the sound.  I having hearing problems so I can't even begin to claim to be an expert but I found the sound pleasing but not exceptional.  The bass is really good and helps me hear the sound better.  Some music seemed somewhat staticy to me as well (may have been some of my songs aren't great quality too).I like these speakers, but the price is way more than I would be prepared to spend for PC speakers but everyone's needs are different.  If the price isn't an issue I think you would like the sound produced by these speakers.", "These are awesome speakers! Here is what I like about them...-produces a good, clear sound - with a good range of volume from very quiet to quite loud.-easy to connect with Bluetooth-seems to have a fairly long range-the power and volume controls are touch sensored - very cool!-speakers look sleek with a nice bold colorI really like these speakers!", "These are much larger than I expected. My initial thought was to utilize them with my iPod &#8211; while they sound GREAT with it, the size is cumbersome. I eventually set them up with my laptop docking station, they sound AMAZING and don&#8217;t overwhelm the space. Great for streaming music, movies etc. Would have probably used them in my livingroom as part of my surround sound but they are BRIGHT red &#8211; not really part of my color scheme.", "This multimedia speaker set is truly beast -- they sound really great for 2.0 speakers! They are also huge and heavy -- I don't know for sure if there is a connection -- they could just have these big weights in them - (he-he)! When I saw the specs I couldn't believe the size and weight -- these are not portable, wireless speakers, they are made to sit in one place and make beautiful sounds, and they are pretty to boot! They connect to your equipment with Bluetooth or with a 3.5 mm cable -- I think the Bluetooth provides better sound, though.This set has a handy remote control in addition to controls on the main speaker. It also has a power brick and several wires.These things are solidly built with some big, heavy magnets on the main speakers -- that's why they are so heavy. The parts in the back are some kind of resonators that supposedly help the bass. I think these speakers will last a good, long time.they are about a foot tall -- I'll upload a pic -- I hate it when products do not show anything with them to show scale -- they could be huge or tiny...", "These Edifier Luna Eclipse speakers work great and have multiple uses within my household. They sound great while taking up very little space. When I had first received the unit, I was very pleased with how well they were packaged. The packaging alone for the speakers must have cost a lot of money. It's very high quality, and visually appealing while protecting the speakers inside.I hooked the speakers up to my TV since it has a 3.5mm stereo output jack (AUX/headphone). I had to set the speakers to about 50% volume, otherwise at idle they had a light static/white noise effect. I was then able to turn my TV's volume up or down to the proper level where it was comfortable to listen to. Second, I tested the speakers with my smartphone. The speakers broadcast itself as a Bluetooth pairing device, so it was very easy to find and connect to them with my phone. I started playing some music after connecting, and I was very impressed with the audio quality. The mids were strong, highs were high, and the lows were present (but slightly lacking). These speakers cover a very broad spectrum of sound and do a good job at it, but they seem to lack in the lower end where bass may be the main focus of a song. Though the speakers come with built in 3 inch sub woofers, they still are not large enough to truly move enough air and sound to create deep and intense bass. It's to be expected with really any speaker set with a built in sub woofer. Don't get me wrong though, this set of speakers has some of the best audio quality and bass I've ever heard (for being small built in woofers, instead of a dedicated large sub). I also noticed that while the TV is on, if you activate Bluetooth from a smartphone or tablet, it will take priority. Audio from the stereo line will switch over to the Bluetooth connection and play from your phone or tablet instead. It's a bit of a nice feature.Overall, I recommend these speakers as a good general purpose bookshelf type of speaker. If you're going to be mainly hooking up something to your television, a 2.1 sound bar system for around the same price will provide you with comparable sound (and deeper bass with it's dedicated sub). They'd make great speakers for your desktop or laptop computer, bedroom, study, or any large gatherings.", "My first thought after unpacking the set of Edifier USA e25 Luna Eclipse speakers was &#34;Wow, these things are big.&#34;  It's hard to tell from the product photos but the speakers are about a foot tall and quite heavy.  The smooth aesthetics, hefty build quality, and top-notch packaging gave me a really good first impression of these speakers.Setting up the speakers was straightforward and quick.  My iPad and iPhone discovered and paired with the e25 Luna Eclipse instantly.  I also connected the speakers to my iMac via the included 6' audio patch cable.  Total setup time was probably about 5 minutes.The control buttons on the speakers are touch sensitive which is really nice.  If the controls were normal buttons that needed to be pressed, then you'd most likely need to use both hands to turn them on/off or control the volume.  But, with since they are touch sensitive, a light touch with your finger is all that is needed.  There is also a small remote included that's handy if you want to make adjustments when you're not near the speakers.I'm impressed with the sound quality as well.  My main use for this set is to listen to music via my desktop computer in my home office which is approximately 8' x 10' in size.  These speakers easily fill my office with sound.  These speakers deliver a punchy bass as well as smooth, crisp highs.  The weakest part of the sound is the mids which feel more in the background than I'd like.  Still, the overall soundstage is quite nice.  I want to break in the drivers a bit longer before trying to crank these up high but even at a fairly high volume level, there is no distortion with these speakers, very nice.The e25 Luna Eclipse speakers meet my needs perfectly and I would definitely recommend them.", "I am very impressed with this set of speakers. Not only do they look nice and sharp, they have an amazing sound.  Installation was very quick - either way bluetooth or stereo plug.Pairing the device takes no time at all and the device does not have to be very close to the speakers - I had a smarphone on the first floor and the speakers on the second floor, they still connected without a problem.  Also, trying a regular stereo output jack was simple to connect as long as I remembered to disconnect any bluetooth setting I'd previously had.The sound is really bright.  Clear and deep bass with nice wide range of frequency levels.  I tried some specific tests off of the internet to check for different instruments and parameters with great results.  We have the speakers set in already and playing just about everyday, no problem.I am not very impressed with the remote control but that's the least of concerns.  The remote control doesn't seem to work well when the speakers are connected via bluetooth - no problem with regular jack plug.  The speakers are sensitive enough that a small touch on the &#34;+&#34; & &#34;-&#34; volume works better than the wireless RC.Satisfied with the performance of these speakers, price range is somewhat in the middle, recommended.", "I listened to a pair of these in a shop a couple of weeks ago and thought they sounded great. Pairing my phone was a no-brainer and they immediately impressed me with their punchy bass and good volume. I went back last week and bought a pair, after haggling for a deal that got me 20% off (something you can't do when you shop on-line). I'll admit up-front that it was a delayed impulse purchase - I was perfectly happy with my Audioengine 2 (A2) set-up and certainly hadn't been shopping for new speakers when I saw them in the shop. I was drawn by the striking design and the brand - I used to travel with a 2.1 system that was re-branded as Aurora when Edifier's product portfolio started to fill out and I always liked them.The big question was always going to be how they stack up against the A2s because no matter how gorgeous they look, the sound is always what matters in the end. I was prepared to return them if they didn't measure up but I was reasonably confident they would earn their place in my home. The good news is that they did not disappoint. As mentioned, the bass is punchy and tight, although at high volumes it can start to sound a little clipped, but that is preferable to distortion. They are capable of producing lower frequencies than the A2s which makes them instantly sound &#34;better&#34;. I've had several units whose speakers relied on passive radiators over the years and I've always enjoyed the results. With two passive radiators in each enclosure, these do even better.Overall the sound is quite reminiscent of what I call the &#34;Bose sound&#34;. The bass is punchy and the top end sparkles but it is, to a degree, at the expense of the mid range (upper mids in particular). It is a very pleasant sound when you are listening but, unlike the A2s, there is no way you could use these speakers to mix an album. They are capable of being quite a bit louder than the A2s, too, which is a definite advantage.After a week of playing all the bass-heavy music I can find I am starting to feel a little guilty towards the A2s. They are great little speakers, I'd recommend them to anyone, but the Luna Eclipse pair are just better when it comes to enjoying what you are listening to and they cost me $40 less. They are particularly suited to modern production techniques - heavily limited albums like Devo's 2010 album, Something For Everybody, and Men Without Hat's recent Love in the Age of War sound amazing. So do really dense productions like Front Line Assembly's Echogenetic.As I said, though, they are not perfect. I find it takes half-a-dozen goes to switch them on using the touch-controls on the active speaker but using the remote works every time. I also find it more than a little annoying that they always default to a specific volume when I switch them on, instead of remembering the last setting I used. For those reasons they don't quite earn 5 stars but they are certainly worthy of four-and-a-half because they are minor quibbles. Where it really counts, Edifier have delivered in spades.", "Wow, These speakers are absolutely Awesome, they look stunning and sound even better, The sound seems to be almost 3D at times its like some of the sounds come out at you, I hear things that Ive never heard before in my music, the Remote is very small unobtrusive and easy to use it also looks really nice but its a shame its not made of alloy like the Apple T.V one but it does look really good, I use these on my Mac Mini so i also installed a DSP software to give a bit more bass but thats just personal preference and really is not needed, The speakers are well constructed and Ive never had a problem with distortion, I love em !!!"], "Gamma": [0.05458313226699829, 0.0549730509519577, 0.054971374571323395, 0.0549730509519577,
