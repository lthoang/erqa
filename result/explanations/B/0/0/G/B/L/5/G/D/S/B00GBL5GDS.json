"], "reviews": ["I was so excited to try this foot scrubber out because I never give my feet the attention that they deserve. This foot scrubber looked like a good idea so I was happy to give it a try.It has a large rubber pad with suction cups on the bottom and two different foot scrubbers on the top plus a detachable pumice stone. The foot scrubbers on top have two different patterns. The first is just a bunch of little dots and the second pattern has circular patterns that massage your feet as you scrub them. Both patterns feel very good on your feet but it's difficult to get the entire thing to stay in place while you scrub. It has a ton of suction cups on the bottom of it so one would think that it would stick but that isn't the case at all. I can't get a single suction cup to stick to the bottom of my tub. I just have a standard tub so I don't think that has anything to do with it. The pumice stone is nice but once again it slides all around. It's made to be detachable but it's glued to a plate that holds it in place. On my very first use it came detached from the plate so it had no chance of staying in place. The only way that I can use it is by holding it in my hand.Even though this foot scrubber has some design issues I still enjoy using it. It's a good idea and the materials are good but they do need to work on the design because it could certainly be improved.Sample provided for review.", "Um I don't know this product I have a bath mat like this so I thought I would give it a try the suction isnt the best but I found if you hold it down with one foot and scrub then rotate feet after you are done with one foot the stone is ok but it was messy with power everywhere over all it still gets the job done with just a bit of work", "In order to use the BelleSha Hands Free Foot Scrubber in the shower or the bath, you&#8217;ll have to make sure to attach the suction cups to a non-porous surface.  For example, if you have a tiled floor, the suction cups simply will not adhere to the surface.  There are eighteen suction cups, an ample amount to secure the foot scrubber adequately to the side of a tub or the base of one when showering.This is a three part foot scrubber.  In the center is a small 3-1/2&#8221; x 2-3/8&#8221; removable pumice stone.  It will remain firmly in the scrubber if you care to use it in the bath or shower, but can be removed if you want to sit and use to exfoliate your feet while giving yourself a pedicure.  It can be easily popped out by pushing at the open hole in the back of the stone.  Reinserting it is very simple.There are two different massaging brushes on either side of the pumice stone.  One is nibbed and the other softer and much more flexible.  Both are perfect if you&#8217;d like to lightly massage your feet while washing.FEATURES:&#9658;  Three ways of pampering your feet&#9658;  Suction cups for hands free cleaning of feet&#9658;  Clean and exfoliate your feet&#9658;  Detachable pumice in the centerThe only downside of the BellaShe foot scrubber is the untreated acrylic, which does have a pungent odor which is offensive to many people.  There are ways to treat it, which can be readily found on the Internet.  However, if you don&#8217;t care for the PVC-like smell or it bothers you, simply take a pass.Sample provided for review.", "This awesome hands free foot scrubber can turn your shower into a day at the spa. There are three different sections. On the left and right are two different types of scrubbers. Both are plastic. One has larger bristles and is a little softer than the other. Both not only scrub your feet, getting them soft and clean, but also provide a pampering foot massage.  In the center is an oval pumice that will remove dead skin and callouses, smoothing and exfoliating the skin on your feet until it's baby soft. This section is removable and can be replaced when it wears out.The best part of this foot scrubber is that there is no bending involved. The suction cups adhere to the bottom of the tub or shower, holding it firmly in place. You just rub your feet against them so there is no back strain. Having this is my shower makes me feel like I had a pedicure every day. It's well made and a great value for the money.Complimentary product received in exchange for an honest review.", "The pumice stone is a good size smacked in the middle of two foot scrubbers.  The foot scrubbers are of different sizes and gives you a nice reflexive massage.Suction cups:The suction cups are well spread apart.  They are smaller in size but distributed evenly under the scrubbers and under the pumice stone.  Both of our tub and shower have bumpy floors (which I would guess intentional to prevent you from easily slipping) which doesn't work effectively with the suction cups.  The only thing that it would stick well is on the side of the tub where it is much smoother.Anyway, it is a good idea but will not work on all types of baths.  The scrubbers works well and the pumice stone is nicely cut and effective as an abrasive for those with callouses.  It cleans clean the underside of your feet well.", "It&#8217;s spring and time for bare feet.  I&#8217;m always happy to leave the heavy shoes and socks behind, but, working in the yard, I&#8217;m often rewarded with dirty, sometimes even muddy feet.  This foot scrubber is an ingenious answer for the problem.  It features two scrubbers, one fairly stiff, one fairly soft, on each end of the device and a pumice stone in the middle.The device has suction cups to attach to a hard surface; however, they do not attach to the knobby surface of my shower, so the device slips around all over the shower floor while I&#8217;m showering.  I do get some scrubbing out of the device, but the pumice stone is completely ineffective without being secured to the floor.This is an ingenious device but you must check the flooring if you plan to use it in your shower.  You need a smooth surface for it to attach to.Three Stars!", "I love this! It is easy to use, you just press it onto the floor of the shower or tub and the suction cups hold it there. One side is soft and easy on your feet, great for scrubbing your toes. I suggest sitting down while using this product because you can maneuver your feet easier that way. The other side is more coarse and great for removing stubborn dirt, like that of a day in flip flops. The middle holds a pumice stone for scrubbing the dry skin off of your heels. It is a nice size and doesn't get in the way. I love that it doesn't have a top piece like others I have owned as that usually gets aggravating. I received this product for a fair and hones review, and I will be purchasing one for my daughter, too.", "I had the chance to try out the Bellesha Hands Free Foot Scrubber for review, and it fell short of what I expected and/or was hoping for. Part of that may be how I wanted to use it, but even then there were a couple of things that didn't play out very well.On the positive side, the two different massage surfaces felt good. It's more a sensation thing rather than a stiff scrubbing surface, but that's fine. The pumice stone is also a good touch to have as part of the unit, but I found it pretty much has to be detached to use it with any effectiveness.On the not-so-positive side... the smell of the vinyl is VERY strong (and not all that pleasant). My wife thought it reminded her of the smell of her grandma's house, and &#34;offered&#34; to put it in a freezer bag for me to prevent the smell from permeating anything in the bathroom. Even after using it and letting it air out, the smell didn't diminish.How I was hoping to use it was to put it on tub wall or the enclosure tile so I could rub my feet over it while reclining. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough spare room in either location to make that happen. Also, the suction cups weren't strong enough to hold the unit secure. Any time I moved my foot over it, I had to brace it against the surface with my other foot.If I had the type of tub where I could sit on the edge and soak my feet, this might work well as something to secure on the tub floor under the waterline. As it is, I doubt I'll be getting much more use out of this.Disclosure:Obtained From: PublicistPayment: Free", "\"I really don't like handing out a one star rating, but what else is there to do with a product that breaks the first minute of use and stinks so badly that your hands smell for half an hour after handling it?The pumice stone is supposed to detach... it's glued to a pad that then snaps into place in the middle of the device. With my test sample, the stone detached from the glued pad while I was rubbing my foot on the stone. I wasn't even applying much pressure, as I had it sitting on a plush carpeted floor.The stone could be reglued, but the whole thing stinks so badly that even handling it with my hands left them smelling of chemical. Some reviewers have termed this a \"\"PVC\"\" smell, but in my opinion, it's much worse than that. It's perhaps the strongest and worse smelling chemical odor I've ever smelled coming from a health and beauty product. I don't know what samples the other reviewers received, but mine is absolutely worthless and disgusting.\"", "......and shoddy workmanship too.  The pumice stone fell off while I was getting ready to stick this to the tub. The rubber has a bad chemical smell, I am highly allergic to some odors and this made me gag. So stinky I had to bag it separately and stick it in the trash cart in the garage. The suction cups didn't stick to the tub either. It's a brilliant idea, but needs a lot of improvement.  ~~~~sample received for review~~~~"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10904981195926666, 0.10582008212804794, 0.08533810079097748, 0.10118304193019867, 0.10848671942949295, 0.10692416876554489, 0.10101038962602615, 0.09349805861711502, 0.0940745621919632, 0.09461506456136703]]}
