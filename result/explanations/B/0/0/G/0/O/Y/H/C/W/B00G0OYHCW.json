With that said, the Super Mario Bros Wii U package is just simply the Wii U with the games Mario + Luigi Bros. So, it wasn't like it was a customized Wii U for Mario. That was a bit disappointing, but irrelevant to our game enjoyment. We've logged about 20 hours on the Mario Wii U game so far and it is quite fun! Still the challenge of jumping on each other and causing the other one to fall into the lava, water, etc. but that is part of the fun too. They managed to add some new stuff while maintaining all that made the prior versions great. I've heard very good things also about the Luigi version but have yet to play it.There are a lot of bonus games (challenges like time and coin, etc.) that make it extremely challenging for bonus play. In addition to the 3 star coins per level, there are additional inventive and fun play opportunities using the Wii U Game Pad. I was pleasantly surprised that you have the unique ability when using the game pad (note: you can NOT controller a player in multi-player with the game pad) to create up to 4 blocks at any one time that can allow mario or other characters to jump on them. This provides a great \"\"life saving\"\" option if mario misses a jump and you can quickly give him a lava-saving step. This is done flawlessly and quickly in game while the action is occurring. Lastly, there are secret blocks and other items that appear only on the gamepad, and the game pad user must \"\"action\"\" them to allow mario to access them. These include 1ups and more.In the end, we're extremely happy with this purchase and I already ordered Super Mario 3d World as I've heard it's simply a joy multiplayer and single. If you're on the fense as if you should purchase this new Wii U...especially if you already have an older Wii....ABSOLUTELY! It is very worth it and you can use your existing controllers and most accessories.\"", "I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  The hand held controller is impressive, not that I ever got to hold it myself.Just be sure that the games you like to play are available.  Wii tends to be more arcade and kids games.", "Had to get a Wii U in anticipation of Mario Kart 8! This was a great one to get because New Super Mario Bros. U is also a great game, then they throw in New Super Luigi U and it's a no-brainer. Did I mention the Wii that it comes with is the Deluxe 32 GB version? If you are purchasing a Wii U now, get this one while it's still around, it's easily the best deal!", "I love this system for younger kids and for those who are not into the intense games offered by Play Station and Xbox.  If your kids are into the Mario games, they will love this.The set up is super fast and it comes with the HDMI cable.  However, the downloads take some time so it's best to set up before your impatient kids get annoyed.Do yourself a favor, but it elsewhere.  You'll save $50.  It's $299 almost everywhere.  I paid a few dollars ($20) more on purpose because I got an additional game (NintendoLand) and a Mario Wii Remote.  The remotes, which are needed for many games are $40.  It's debatable what the true value of NintendoLand is.", "I've grown right along with the video game industry getting the Atari 2600 when I was 8 years old, and grabbing most of the new systems as they've come out. Beginning with the original Nintendo Entertainment System, I've always enjoyed the products Nintendo has brought to market. (I still break out my N64 every now and again to play &#34;Goldeneye&#34;, &#34;No Mercy&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34;). With kids of my own, I really liked the idea behind the Wii, get some motion mixed into gameplay so they aren't just sitting there using their thumbs. We had many family game nights playing &#34;Wii Sports&#34; and the Olypmics based games featuring Mario and Sonic.With that said, I was really hesitant about picking up the Wii U when it first came out. I was knee-deep in PS3 games like the &#34;Resident Evil&#34; series and &#34;Assassin's Creed&#34;, and didn't want to really shell out any more money for the latest and greatest Mario Games. To be honest, the Wii U looked like a money-grab, simply adding a big version of the GameBoy to the Wii system, and I didn't see the attraction.All of that changed the first time I played the Wii U. The touchscreen gamepad adds a whole new dimension to multi-player games, and even allows you to continue playing your game when the rest of the family would rather watch TV. I picked up this set with the Mario & Luigi game combo, and immediately got sucked back into the world of Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and Bowser. You forget just how much fun these games are if you've been away from them for awhile.I also bought the Disney Infinity game with a few of their figurines, and have really enjoyed playing all of these games with my wife and kids. It's almost become a nightly ritual where we will sit around laughing and playing Mario, or Disney for an hour or so. Even my son who spent most of his Christmas break playing &#34;Call of Duty: Ghosts&#34; on PS3, can't resist the fun and challenge of the games on the Wii U. (I've also ordered &#34;Zombie U&#34; to give a more adult title a try, and I'm really looking forward to it).And one of the best things about the Wii U, (something the PS4 and Xbox One should take note of), all of the Wii games work in the new Wii U system. Your old motion controllers work with the Wii U as well, so you won't have to keep your old Wii system hooked up if you want to play the old games you own, you can use the Wii U. Nintendo should be praised by all gamers for this decision. I've dropped a lot of money each game system, and it's great that we can simply plug &#34;Mario Party 8&#34; or &#34;Resident Evil 4&#34; or any of the older titles into the Wii U and just keep playing.Wii U also makes it easy for you to find fellow gamers online, similar to the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live. I haven't really played online as of yet, so I can't really review this portion, but what I really like with the online access, is that you can access the old Nintendo backlog of games. So if you want to give &#34;Goldeneye&#34; at try, or dig deep and go back to &#34;Mario Brothers 3&#34;, &#34;Donkey Kong Country&#34; etc. they are all available to &#34;rent&#34; or own for a small price. Basically all of the old cartridge based titles are at your fingertips.Wii U also allows you stream video services like Amazon Prime, Neflix or YouTube. In short, Wii U is a very affordable complete entertainment package in one box. Highly recommend this system and software.", "The gaming experience on the Wii U is excellent and very well done with wonderful graphics, great audio, great games, great layout with both the TV and gamepad menu screens.  I can not fathom why they did not include DVD support with the Wii U....all other consoles support DVD/blue-ray playback and for the price they all (including the Wii U) should have it.  I hope they release a patch to include it, for 300+ dollars there is no reason not too, if you can install a file on the Wii with mplayer to get DVD playback then it's merly software and needs to be done.  The design of the system and the gamepad looks sharp, is built good and responds very well.  The browser/internet apps/youtube is the best I have used on any console yet, it displays beautifully on the TV screen and the gamepad screen, it is easy to read, super fast and responsive.  The big selling point for me was being able to use all my Wii controllers etc on the Wii U and being able to data transfer my saves and retro games to Wii U.  Having a Wii U is like having a NES/SNES/N64/Wii/TB16/Sega Genisis/Master System all in one which no other console currently offers, on PS4/Xboxone you cannot even play last generations games let alone classics.", "We already own the basic set when it first came out, but my kids love the Wii U so much they want another one so they can play the games while visiting the grandparents, too. So we bought this deluxe set, which seems to be the default official set at this time as of June 2014. The MRSP is actually $299.99, yes, that's the price for the Mario and Luigi deluxe set, which contains two games: Super Mario Bros U and Super Luigi U. We already had both games but since this is the default set anyway, it's totally acceptable. The deluxe set, compared to the basic set which may no longer be sold but I'm not sure... contains more accessories like stands, but more importantly gives the user discounts on all eShop downloads. We're not into digital downloads, here or on our PS4, because you can't take the games with you easily, but it may matter to people who download a lot. I do wish the deluxe set came in white like Basic Set because the black chassis looks ugly.", "I love this game and the mario is very fun to play..also love getting amazon and netflix with this.... great buy", "\"So here was my predicament: I didn't really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don't remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which \"\"set\"\" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn't sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R' Us didn't have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy.Here is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access.1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305.2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-(Mario Kart 8 - Nintendo Wii U). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-(Pikmin 3) is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game.3) If you want the Wii controller that's included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-(Wii Party U), which includes the controller.4) Buy the (Nintendo Wii Wheel for Mario Kart (Black) x 2 Bundle) for $9.Optional:5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-(The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD). The Wonderful 101 is only $24(The Wonderful 101). Super Mario 3D World is $49-(Super Mario 3D World - Nintendo Wii U), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-(Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze - Nintendo Wii U). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store.6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-(Wii U PRO controller (shiro) (WUP-A-RSWA)). It's the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation.If you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don't have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don't want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck!*As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides all that for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said \"\"Nintendo\"\" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi/Toad/Kirby/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com/news/2014/06/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that's available across all systems is Rayman. And then there's the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I've bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there's a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I'm already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com/elite-status-gifts.do].If you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!\"", "If you're going to buy it, buy the deluxe set, any of them. There are a few out there.  We had the Wii and this is so much better. The graphics and the touch pad is a nice touch.", "The games for this system have been wonderful so far.Super Mario 3D World (one of the best mario games onpar with Galaxy)New Super Mario Bros U (the best one in the series)Sonic Lost World (a fun experimental Sonic game onpar with Colors)NES Remix (classic, and creative, innovative)etc...The miiverse functionality is great, the web browser is fast, my main issue though is the Wii U Gamepad. They just cant stop these gimmicks. They could have sold a 250 dollar Wii U with the Pro Controller and made a lot of happy gamers, but instead they wanted to resort to gimmicks, so we pay 100 extra for the controller and run out and buy pro controllers. It's getting tiring. Nobodys going to play smashbros with the gamepad Nintendo, you all know it. Nintendo should focus on fun and creative games (and they do!) but stop feeding us hardware gimmicks. We DO NOT WANT THEM.anyways the systems great, but wait for the price to drop, because the 100 dollar paperweight that is the gamepad is expensive.", "First, allow me to say I've been a long time owner of the Wii (classic white or original if you prefer) and recently upgraded to the Wii U.  Second, I will caveat that I do not consider this to be my primary gaming platform (PC, PS3, then maybe Wii U, then tablet/smartphone).That being said, the Wii U took a fairly old system and gave it a bit of life.  Too many other systems figured out that the &#34;motion&#34; type control was what people wanted to interact with games and so Wii lost its advantage.  When the Wii U was introduced, however, I think Nintendo regained some of its old glory.  No, I do not think this system advanced the company ahead of either PlayStation or Microsoft - but the touch screen, improved video output, upgraded WiFi adapter, and overall faster processing give this little thing a nice boost.First, the touchscreen controller.  While a bit large and certainly not as &#34;user friendly&#34; as the other controllers out there, it has the unique distinction of having a touchscreen in the center that allows you another medium to interact with the game you are playing or the software you are running.  Whether you want to watch your big screen while you hop Mario around the map or look down at your controller for those quick, hair raising moments, you have both options at your disposal.  Additionally, software such as Netflix now give you the option to see what you are playing, advance, pause and even see reviews of the show/movie while it is still playing on the screen (or even transfer to the little screen, so you don't disturb others.  The controller - while big, is a highlight for me.The video output (now up to 1080i - at least on my screen) and the WiFi (802.11b/g/n) improvements over the old Wii are worth it in my book.  While we enjoy a good game of Mario or playing on the balance board, we enjoy watching Netflix and Amazon Prime just as often.  Now you can view those in HD streaming - with the upgraded video and WiFi connection.  Win!Finally, the Wii U, while unable to play the old Nintendo GameCube games, is a heck of a lot faster than the Wii.  You can still play most (haven't found one in my collection yet that doesn't work) games from the old Wii, as the Wii U ships with an emulator for older games - which allow you to use the older controllers.  It may take a little patience, but you can sync all your old controllers, including the balance board, if you follow the onscreen instructions.  Also, if you are the proud owner of a Wii and want to upgrade, there is even a simple way to transfer all your old data from the Wii to the Wii U (SD card required).So, if your Wii is getting a bit long in the tooth or you just want to boost it a little - consider this Wii U.  It is still a work in progress (Nintendo is releasing updates, Netflix is still releasing updates, etc) - but it has worked for me thus far without issue.  There are less interruptions while watching movies and games load faster.  One aside - keep your old controllers or consider purchasing at least two old controllers if you wan to play multiplayer on some games.  The Mario/Luigi games that ship with this can be played alone with the touchscreen or multiplayer with two-four older controllers.  Not all games require only new/only old, but this one does.  Just a heads up if you're looking to buy this for the game and want to play with your family/friends.", "As far as the product itself, the Wii U is a great console and New Super Mario Bros. U is plenty of fun.However, be aware that Amazon does NOT sell Nintendo consoles (there was some sort of contractual dispute and Amazon decided to drop those sales). So you will only find them being sold by third parties, which are often intent on jacking up the prices. If you want to pay the normal price stop by a game store or other physical retailer. I'll avoid posting the price or specific names because Amazon might delete reviews that mention such information - but needless to say, you're almost always going to get a better deal on Nintendo hardware from a retailer other than Amazon.", "I had an old first generation Wii.. The thing that drove me nuts on the Wii with the very slow scene change times, game loading, and navigation of the system in general. Enter the Wii U - Great - this thing is loaded with high-end processors and graphics engine, tons of memory, lots of flash storage. It should be awesome! Um, not so much.The system in general is VERY VERY slow, MUCH slower than the old Wii just navigating system menus. It's 30 seconds to go from screen to screen. I'm sorry, in this era of computing, anything with delays like that is a total failure. The people responsible for a design this unresponsive should be fired and blacklisted from the industry - about all they are qualified for is driving a garbage truck.. Yes, it is THAT bad.As another reviewer mentioned, the first thing the Wii U has to do is updates. Lots and lots of updates. And it fails over and over and over with random errors that even the support web site can't decipher. At one point it randomly decided to actually work and apply an update. Nintendo - you have 32G of flash storage and you can't load the system with error MESSAGES? You have to use code numbers?!!!!! Really?!!!!So here we are, lots of flash storage, and the ability to hook up a dedicated hard disk for more. You would think that the system would cache your frequently used games in memory, right? Nope - that memory is ONLY for downloaded games. It runs the games off the slow DVD drive constantly banging on it, LONG pauses between scenes. Apparently there are people that put up with this! Nintendo NEEDS an update that totally revamps the main menu system so that it is INSTANT - going from menu to menu should happen NOW and not with a 30 second delay. They need to cache the DVD's in system flash - requiring the DVD to be loaded is OK, just don't grind the crap out of the DVD drive for hours on end.After all the frustration of just getting the Wii to work, updated, configured, navigating the terrible menus, you FINALLY get into a game - and the games can be pretty good, which is the only reason I didn't review it with zero stars. But I'm not reviewing the games here - just the system itself. And the system itself needs a LOT of work.", "I am really pleased with my purchase of the Wii U.  It is an innovative system that is great for family game time, and the game pad makes browsing the menu so much easier than the old Wii system.  I only have the Mario games and the new Wii Sports (Tennis and Bowling), and yet I find myself playing them often, without the need to purchase another game (yet).The Wii U really isn't comparable to the Xbox One or Playstation 4, as those systems reach out to a different set of gamers.  I see this system as more of a family console, or for someone who just likes fun games.  The HD output really gives the games a great look, and I would recommend the system to those who liked the Wii, especially if you still own games and the Wii hardware.Updating the system takes about as long as any other computer I have owned, including the Playstation 3.  I know there have been complaints, and the initial update does take a while, but further updates have taken much less time, in fact, they were surprisingly fast.  I think the out of the box update is quite a major one, which is why it takes so long.I really like the tablet/gamepad, much more than I anticipated.  It is quite a deal to get both the system and gampad for three hundred (at other sites), with the mario games as well.  Overall, a purchase that I feel was well worth the expense."], "Gamma": [0.032992325723171234, 0.032445408403873444, 0.032992325723171234, 0.018587816506624222, 0.032992325723171234,
