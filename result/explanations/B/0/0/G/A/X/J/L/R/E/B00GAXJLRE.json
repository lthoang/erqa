Fowler shows a product that is different from mine. However, the sample I received is exactly like the pictures so perhaps they received theirs from a different batch. Their review is very thorough so I will leave my personal experience here.This comes with two cooling eye gel pouches and a silky mask into which they slip. I thought I was supposed to refrigerate these gel packets but I didn't the first night I slept with it and they stayed cool all night, leaving my eyes less puffy and tired looking in the morning.I tried to use this right out of the package, but quickly decided that I would wash it before use. It appeared clean but had a slight glue odor when I put it on...I picked a bad night to stop sniffing glue...anyway, after I washed it the odor seems to be gone completely. It withstood the wash, I let it air dry. I'm not sure I would do that very often but I needed to see if I could get rid of that smell.Overall, this mask is really comfortable. It keeps out light and seems to be relatively well made. The cooling packets stayed in place and I made it through the entire night without ripping the mask off out of discomfort.Recommend", "This BelleSha Beauty Sleep Extra Comfortable Sleep Mask is decent quality and works well as a sleep mask. I always use a sleep mask since my room has a lot of ambient light, so I was pleased to be able to try out this set. Here are my observations:Includes; Sleep Mask, Single Gel Mask, Earplugs (which I didn't use)Pros -+ Quality; this is good quality and should last a very long time+ Comfort; these feel good and do not distract while sleepingCons -- Light Leakage; these do let a little light in under the eyes, but that might be due to the shape of my faceMisc -* Gel Insert; this is a one piece design, not the two shown in the product pictureOverall, this is a nice sleep mask set that works well.Recommended!CFHNote: Sample provided to review", "This sleep mask is made of 100% silk and is very comfortable to wear. It's black on the inside and beige on the outside with Beauty Sleep sewn onto the outside. It has an adjustable strap for the perfect fit and it blocks out the light good. It also comes with two cold packs that are removable. You don't want to freeze them as it will be too cold on your eyes. It's best to just put them in the refrigerator for a few hours to get them nice and cool. Then you slide them into the sleep mask for a nice cooling effect. The cool packs feel nice if your eyes are sore. I got an eyelash in one of my eyes and I scratched my eye trying to get it out. I used this sleep mask that nice with the cool packs in it and it felt nice. It gives you the flexibility to either use it normally or with the cooling packs. It also comes with a single set of ear plugs although I could never sleep with ear plugs in. They make my ears for after a while so I would never sleep all night with them in. Overall this is a high quality and very nice set at an affordable price.Sample provided for review.", "I had a cheap sleep mask while that did the trick for many years I usually had to take it off midway while sleeping since it would roll up on my face having this on with the round blue cool circles helped keep the mask from curling up while sleeping", "One of the nicest things about this sleep mask was that it was ultra-comfortable. It definitely felt soft and silky and indeed, I didn't know that it was silk until I read the description. There is a 1/2&#34; elasticized band with lightweight metal buckles so that if you need to adjust the mask you can do so. The elastic is quite stretchy and I didn't have to adjust it at all.The mask itself is actually quite large, unlike a couple I already have. It's a full 8-3/4&#34; (L) x 4-1/2&#34; (D) at its widest points. It was so large it actually covered quite a bit of my nose, however, because it was so soft I didn't find this at all uncomfortable. The mask is larger simply so it will accommodate an additional cooling gel mask.FEATURES:&#9658; Exceptionally comfortable sleep mask&#9658; Adjustable strap&#9658; Sleep mask Material: 100% silk&#9658; Will not irritate skinThe photograph on Amazon shows a couple of round cooling gel inserts, however I received a mask-like one. I really like this and find that it is a significant improvement over the round ones. The mask can be tucked inside the sleep mask or, if desired, worn separately.The cooling gel pack doesn't have a wide band, but rather a thin, strong corded elasticized band. There are cutouts for the eyes so once cooled I didn't feel any discomfort. The sleep mask does look rather garish (don't they all?), but I really do love the functionality and comfort, something that really counts. There is one set of ear plugs included if you also want to block out sound.Sample provided for review.", "Contents:1) Silk sleep mask covering with adjustable elastic strap.2) Gel Insert mask (not two pieces as shown) attached to a thin elastic band.3) 2 EarplugsFirst, let me say that the BelleSha Beauty Sleep Extra Comfortable Sleep Mask (wow, they might think about shortening that name!) has all the components of a very nice product.  Somehow, though, they don't quite work together as seamlessly as I might have hoped.  The first thing that I noticed as I opened up the sleep mask is that there is absolutely no packaging and usage information available.  Granted, it's not rocket science to assemble a sleep mask, but I think instructions as to what might be done with the gel insert might have been nice.  Obviously, it can be chilled.  But is it OK to freeze?  How about to warm? (As the elastic band has a metal hitch in it, I hope no one decides to pop it into the microwave).  Also, the sales listing suggest washing the silk mask before use but the product itself doesn't say that or give you washing instructions.  In fact, each product label is written entirely in a foreign language.That said, I wanted to like this mask.  However, I am put off by the fact that the pictured product shows an individual gel pack for each eye and what you get is a full mask.  That, in and of itself, isn't a huge issue.  I like the mask idea better.  But it has a big band on it so that it may be worn independently of the silk covering.  When it is inserted into the covering, therefore, it is exceedingly awkward.  You've got to stuff that elastic somewhere so you aren't feeling it on your face.  It simply doesn't make sense.  KGHarris, 6/14.Note: I was offered a sample of this product in which to provide an honest review.", "This is a comfortable and nice sleep mask. I used on a metro train ride and was good! Be careful of your valuables (of course!). Overall felt great. Sample provided in exchange of a fair review.", "This is by far one of the best sleep masks that I have tried! I love the gel inserts. I stick them in the freezer in the morning and they are ready to go at night. It has greatly helped to relieve the fatigue of my eyes. It has also helped diminish the dark circles. The mask itself is very comfortable and stays put through out the night. I had no problem with light seeping in and the ear plugs where an added bonus. I received this product for a fair and honest review.", "This is a comfortable enough sleep mask that does a good job blocking out light.  The included earplugs are nice for people who like them to mask sound though personally I can't abide anything in my ears.  I was provided a free sample for review.", "I tried out the BelleSha Beauty Sleep mask as it's a departure from the other masks I have. This product includes two gel pads that you can remove and refrigerate/freeze to help soothe the eyes. The mask itself is silk without any form or structure, so it isn't set up to mold around the nose or eye sockets. It's basically just a silk fabric mask that can hold the gel pads to your eye sockets.Overall, it's not bad if you're using it as a eye treatment. The pads move around, so you can get them positioned over your eyes and let the cooling begin. Pro Tip: *Refrigerate* the pads, don't *freeze* them... When they are frozen, it's like putting an icepack on your face... not comfortable. When I went for refrigeration instead, the effect was much more to my liking.As a sleep mask, I wasn't as thrilled. Because it's not formed to fit the face, it doesn't keep out the light as well as the foam-formed versions. I also found that the lower part of the mask could fold over sometimes, letting in even more light.Your satisfaction will likely depend on your expectations. Gel pack for the eyes, great... sleep mask to block out light, not as good.Disclosure:Obtained From: PublicistPayment: Free"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.09705010801553726, 0.09723363071680069, 0.10338865965604782, 0.10663396120071411, 0.09485088288784027, 0.09113888442516327, 0.10149553418159485, 0.11205476522445679, 0.1007138043642044, 0.0954398587346077]]}
