"], "reviews": ["I've been on the hunt for the perfect contouring brush and I think I found it!  Even though this brush is recommended for creams, I think it works amazingly well as a contour brush.The bristles are soft and not too dense (if they are too dense they end up picking up too much product and creating stripes or take forever to blend out).  I tapped this into my Tarte matte bronzer and the the angled edge fit perfectly right under my cheek bones for a perfect contour.  I was even able to use this brush to contour the sides of my nose too.", "I didn't end up using this brush much.  Very fluffy so it didn't pick up make up well.  Nice handle though.  Comfortable to grip.if you don't mind the extra work.", "I have many brushes from EcoTools, this brush has some good and some negative points. The construction of this brush is solid like any other EcoTools brush and bristles are firmly attached and don't come off easily like with some sable hair type brushes. This is a good brush for BB creams and pigmented lotions for the face as it has a large diameter and is tapered for the face. The bristles also don't absorb too much of the product so you can apply a small amount over a large area and then it cleans up easy.However, the drawback is that the bristles tend to clump up when they are dipped into a BB cream or makeup. So it tends to leave streaks across the face if you have a very pigmented BB cream. It works OK with products with more moisturizer or lotion but blending in the product is no fun as the bristles are hard and prickly and they start to hurt.I still gave it 3 stars as the EcoTools as it's sturdy and cleans up nicely and a good price point. If you're using this for BB cream it a good brush. For a makeup or foundation or something with higher color payoff or a thinner consistency than BB cream you will have to use a brush that has bristles that become softer and finer toward the top and help you blend better, like many MAC or Ulta brushes used for contouring and base application.", "\"I was interested in trying this brush because I own other EcoTools brushes, and I love them--they are soft, well-made, and high quality.  This \"\"Skin Perfecting Brush\"\" is up to the usual EcoTools standards.  However, unlike all of my other EcoTools brushes, which I use to apply DRY makeup products (e.g., blush, eye shadow, powder, etc.), this brush is intended for use with WET products such as BB cream or tinted moisturizer.  I tried it with my BB cream, and I just didn't find that it worked particularly well.  The brush seemed to absorb the product, necessitating me using more than I normally would have, and the brush didn't do a good job of spreading the product evenly.  Plus, once the brush is wet, you can't really put it back in the case, which is fabric on the inside.I will probably see if I can find another use for this brush, since as noted, I do like EcoTools in general and the quality of their brushes in particular.  But so far, this brush has not worked for me.Edited 3/22/14:  I have started using this brush a bit more.  I have found that it is useful for ensuring that concealer/similar products are spread evenly once they are dry; I also like it for applying pressed powder around the eye area.  So, while I still don't think this brush is appropriate for applying liquid products, I'm glad I have been able to use it for other purposes, as it is a high quality product as noted in my original review.\"", "This pretty, soft brush isn't the best for applying BB cream.  I found it wasn't the best at applying anything with a liquid consistency.  However, it does work for spreading already applied concealer or foundation.I know that isn't what it was intended for, so I gave it 3 stars because it isn't very effective for what it is advertised.  However, it is a nice brush that it is eco-friendly and that makes me happy, so it got 3 stars based on the quality of the brush, and what the company is achieving by using recycled materials to create it.", "This EcoTools brush is a great quality brush for a low price. I was very impressed with the soft feel of the bristles and how well it is made. You do not have to worry about loose bristles on your face when using this brush.I knew from the get-go that I probably would not want to use this brush for BB/CC cream like it is recommended. I have perfected my BB Cream routine by using a Beauty Blender. For review purposes, I decided to try this brush on my BB cream first. It did a great job of blending the BB cream into my skin. However, it seemed like too much BB cream was left on the bristles. I cleaned the brush immediately afterwards using two different brands of makeup remover. The brush was stained brown.I do however like this brush for applying my HD powder or even for blush. The bristles feel great on my skin and it does a great job of blending the powder.I do recommend this brush, just not for what it is intended for. With the wasted BB cream and difficulty to clean, I don't like this brush for BB cream.", "I really wanted to like this brush as it's pretty--bamboo handle, metal, and super-soft bristles.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work at all for what it was designed for.I tried it both with BB cream and a liquid foundation.  The bristles held too much foundation/cream and would deposit it unevenly around my face.  Try as I might, it was impossible to smooth out. I ended up with entirely too much product on my face.Because the bristles are so densely packed, this brush is NOT suitable for applying blush, unless you like yours in a big stripe across your cheek.  Similarly, it is not fluffy enough to use with powder.I've used this (dampened) a couple of times to smooth out foundation at the jawline, but it's really not worth purchasing the brush for that purpose.", "Sigh...when i was younger, I didn't really need makeup. Some eyeliner, maybe mascara. Now...the more the better. I actually have to watch video tutorials on how to apply makeup (and I'm past 20 years old but under 50!) This one makeup artist swore by foundation brushes. Which, I gather, is what this tool is. It would be helpful for makeup newbies like me if it would state exactly what it was - otherwise, had it not been a &#34;free&#34; sample, I would have skipped it if I saw it in the store shopping.ANYWAY. I always either used my fingers or a Q-Tip to put on concealer/foundation. Started using this, and I have to say, the makeup is just flawless now. I'd highly recommend. Now, if only they explained how to clean it and how often???Oh - it also comes in a soft pouch that would be great to throw in your suitcase or purse if/when traveling. I don't have a makeup kit yet, but the more wrinkles I accumulate, the closer I get to buying one!", "This brush is the perfect size for applying BB cream around the eyes and nose.  The bristles are amazingly soft and the tapered end gives plenty of control.  The brush is smaller than I'd normally use for a foundation and tends to get dirty quickly - it's not one you could use without washing between uses.", "Finding a decent brush that is affordable enough to throw away (due to hygiene concerns) in a few months yet provide a decent working/functional brush isn't always easy. This is a good balance between function, eco and value. Having said that, I would not use this for foundation but rather only dry due to the soft but fairly stiff bristles.", "EcoTools  Skin Perfecting Brush: This is the first time I have heard of this company but I like their attitude toward caring for our planet.Indeed yes, there are brushes you can purchase which are comprised of animal hair, such as sable make up brushes, brushes made of Boar's hair, and so on.However, even if you are not vegan, not a member of PETA, not an animal lover, and maybe you just don't care about anything at all except your MAKEUP, I am not here to judge you,I am here to tell you this is a good, inexpensive, nice brush to use to assist you in applying your BB creme (I use this every time I apply mine) , or to use as a blush brush to shape the contours of that stunning visage of yours!I like this EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush!  I hope you do too!Incidentally, I am not a member of PETA, and I am not vegan--but I have been a vegetarian for 9 years and if I had the guts I would be a vegan...for health reasons as much as anything else.I like to think that one tiny step at a time we will recover our dear planet. It is more complicated than a makeup brush, for sure, but that is a start.Thanks,jean", "This bamboo handled brush with contoured synthetic fibers has a nice feel and weight to it.  I used it first with powder and it worked nicely, for blush and contour which was GREAT and then foundation.  The brush head is small, and I found it worked best for applying foundation around my eyes than the entire face.  I like to use a bigger stipple brush to apply foundation.I am deducting a star because the brush I got wasn't cut properly.  One of the top edges had a section roughly 1/2&#34; across  that was 1/4&#34; taller than it was supposed to be.  I took a photo but not sure I can post it.  I had to try to cut it myself, but it will never be as precise as the machine cut would have been.Compared to my MAC and other professional brushes, this is just as good quality but for about 1/4 the price!", "I got this brush for my wife who uses it with BB cream application.  The head has soft bristles and a nice bamboo handle featuring recyclable aluminum.The brush does apply the product but seems to leave streaks.  Put another way &#8211; there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of benefit from using this brush versus using fingers to smooth on cream.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the bristles are somewhat absorptive so you end up using more product.All that said, there are probably other applications for this brush that make more sense than BB cream.  Overall it is a good quality brush, on par with the expensive brushes.  You&#8217;ll just need to find the use that is most applicable for you.", "This make up brush is great for just about any lady in your life. I like how it came nicely packaged and felt like you were opening up a quality product. The brush backed it up with the construction. The wooden handle is smooth and easy to hold. The bristles are super soft and tightly packed. They have not shed for me yet and the angle gives me a lot of control as to where I want to put powder, especially around my eyes. It goes on smoothly and feels really nice as well. I'm not sure I would try it for rouge since it might give too much of a sharp edge but I suppose you could spread it out.", "I didn't really like this for applying BB cream. It seems to really soak up the cream rather than spread it on my skin but I did find that it works very well at helping me blend my concealer. I had been using a beauty sponge but found it a little hard to blend in the corners of my eyes. This brush works better and it seems quicker as well.Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for giving my a chance to try this out.", "I have been wanting an Eco Tools brush for some time, I'm not disappointed.The bamboo handle is comfortable to hold, the bristles are soft, no streaking, and blend well.I do not use this brush as intended....for wet make-up, because I don't use wet/cream make-up!  I only use a powder bronzer, and it works very well with my powdered bronzer.So....I would definitely recommend this for your powdered products, but cannot give you any help as far as liquid/cream make-ups!", "\"I love Eco Tools brushes, and have several of them in my makeup brush collection. I was excited to try this out since it's designed for applying lighter products like BB creams and tinted moisturizers.  I've been using it every day this week with several different BB creams that I own, and I really like it!The small brush head and contoured shape make it easy to apply product around your nose and under your eyes. It also feels very soft to the touch.It also comes in a cute little naturally-made pouch that you can re-use to carry this brush and others while traveling.The handle is made from bamboo, and the bristles are cruelty-free.While this applies product evenly, the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that it seems to \"\"capture\"\" a lot of product in its bristles.  Each time I'm done using it, I've washed it, and yet after applying my BB creams, a lot of the product still seems to be in the brush itself, making me feel like I'm wasting some product.I think I actually prefer my Tarte buffer brush since that provides the same airbrushed finish, but doesn't seem to waste as much cream.Overall, though, this is a great little brush at a great price!  I would recommend it.\"", "Based on this brush quality I would explore other brushes from this brand.  However, I find I am not in love with this brush style/shape for applying foundation.  I did use with BB and CC creams as suggested.  It doesn't give me the easiest finish, doesn't feel natural to use.  I prefer a flatter brush.  I did feel that this soaked up quite a bit of product and the white bristles were difficult to clean and easily stained.  However, the brush feels good in your hair, the bristles are well secured (it doesn't shed).  The brush is very well made, and is quite soft, and (though it stains) the bristles continue to feel nice after washed.", "I've only recently started wearing make-up so I really had no tools.  Even now, I just do the basics and use this brush to put bronzer across my cheeks so I look less vampire-ish.  This brush is firm so it's easy to direct the product where you want, but it doesn't make harsh lines, in fact, it made my skin look flawless and minimized the pores.  Most importantly, it doesn't SHED hair everywhere and washes up nicely with baby shampoo and air drying.  I would definitely buy other brushes from this brand.", "I love EcoTools brushes. They are the best affordable priced sustainable makeup brushes out there. This brush is supposed to be used for applying BB cream, but I found it works really well with my Armani Maestro as well. It has a stippling effect, really allowing you to get that flawless face finish. I highly recommend it.", "Since this specifically mentions BB creams for it's use, that's what I tried this brush with.  I normally use the BeautyBlender with both BB creams and regular foundation and like the coverage it gives.  The EcoTools brush on the other hand left streaks so that it was very apparent I was wearing makeup.  I also needed to use a lot more of the BB cream than I usually would as the bristles absorbed it.  The bristles are supersoft though.  I think it works better with dry makeup like powder.", "This is a great quality brush and what I've come to expect from Eco Tools. They are the only brush I use. This brush is slightly stiffer than I expected. It is sloped and works well with my Benefit Sugar Bomb powder which I brush under my eyes after applying concealer and on the bridge of my nose. It doesn't shed and is better than most higher end brushes.", "I absolutely love this brush. The bristles are soft and extremely gentle, and they hold the blush (which is what I use it for, but the brush is good for powder and shimmer, as well) very well. It's a great product that I like more than my other, more expensive brushes.", "While I've had and liked other EcoTools brushes in the past I have to say I was really disappointed in this one. I tried a couple of different BB creams, a tinted moisturizer, AND even a light liquid foundation to see if I couldn't get decent results. Streaks!!!The bristles are soft and comfortable, very gentle and they soak up so much product I was having to use more than double what I usually do because it wouldn't come out of them. The finish was streaky every single time which required me to use my fingers to smooth it out... which was the whole reason I wanted the brush... to avoid using my hands.Honestly, I'm kind of now wondering why anyone would bother with a brush intended for BB creams beyond the not wanting to use your hands/fingers factor. I say skip this brush and keep using your fingers unless you like streaks.", "The bristles are soft on the skin; in fact, if I close my eyes and brush it against my skin, this brush is almost undetectable from the feel my Sigma F80 (Flat Kabuki brush), which is a high compliment. Unlike most inexpensive (and some expensive!) brushes, I have not yet seen this brush drop a single hair. Its bristles are synthetic, and therefore cruelty-free.In my opinion, where this brush fails is in its intended purpose--to apply CC creams. I did not find this brush to perform very well when used with this type of product. However, what I have had some success using it with is liquid concealers, which I use in a MUCH smaller amount than an all-over-the-face CC cream. I tend to mix two different concealers to get a good match for my skin, so I put a little dot of each on the back of my hand, and then blend them together. I then use the EcoTools brush to apply the concealer to areas of my face where I need extra coverage, such as dark spots or blemishes before applying my CC cream.In summary, the EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush is a great brush for the money and may have several other good uses, but I do not feel its strength is with application of an all-over-the-face wet product such as a BB or CC cream.", "I rated Ecotools Skin Perfecting Brush 4 stars because it is a nice makeup brush. I have other Ecotools brushes which I absolutely love and find them better quality than any other brand of brushes I have ever tried including MAC. This one is different because of the stiffness and not as soft as my other brushes.I tried using this brush with my compact powder makeup and it absorbed too much powder and did not spread it evenly throughout my face. I tried using it as a contour brush and although it worked better, it felt too stiff. I tried using this with foundation and it came out ok, not as nice as a stifling brush or wet round sponge application. Overall, I'm still searching the best way to use this brush since I like the contoured tip and size.", "I was interested in trying this brush because I have heard that your BB cream will look better if you apply it with a brush instead of your fingers.The brush is very well made, and feels very comfortable in my hand.  The bristles are smooth and whichever way I tried applying the BB cream, they felt nice on my face - not rough or prickly.I haven't been able to get a nice result using this brush.  My bb cream still looks better when applied with my fingertips.", "The bristles on this brush are very soft and fine. Design is eco-friendly including packaging (which is reusable but most likely go in the recycle bin). The handle is good size and it's easy to hold and manipulate. Brush head is slanted slightly for detail and blending.The brush isn't portable though- it's pretty big, not collapsible and definitely a stay-home item. It's also a bit on the expensive side for these things.Overall, a nice item to use."], "Gamma": [0.2614530324935913, 0.22674013674259186, 0.23243290185928345, 0.27937397360801697], "Beta": [[0.037371113896369934, 0.03828065097332001, 0.02484365925192833, 0.032082390040159225, 0.03542161360383034, 0.03538118675351143, 0.038563694804906845, 0.038263507187366486, 0.03476667404174805, 0.03622811287641525, 0.03308924287557602, 0.038176875561475754, 0.03427872806787491, 0.03729136288166046, 0.03575694188475609, 0.036495063453912735, 0.03150220960378647, 0.03499719128012657, 0.04038016125559807, 0.036838456988334656, 0.03329198434948921, 0.03759753704071045, 0.03663456067442894, 0.033477846533060074, 0.03504647687077522, 0.03807936608791351, 0.03833617642521858, 0.0375271737575531], [0.03674301877617836, 0.03726355731487274, 0.02906523272395134, 0.03347970172762871, 0.035501524806022644, 0.03551533445715904, 0.03752724826335907, 0.037263911217451096, 0.03515144810080528, 0.03598422929644585, 0.03399275615811348, 0.03722858056426048, 0.03484059125185013, 0.03667614981532097, 0.03571264445781708, 0.03619513660669327, 0.03325800225138664, 0.03525214269757271, 0.03856850415468216, 0.03636685013771057, 0.034205660223960876, 0.0369207002222538, 0.036256056278944016, 0.03447990491986275, 0.03529256582260132, 0.03714215010404587, 0.037308935075998306, 0.03680749610066414], [0.037019915878772736, 0.03767755627632141, 0.028306106105446815, 0.03292423486709595, 0.03554120659828186, 0.03544296696782112, 0.03750385344028473, 0.037549976259469986, 0.03492466360330582, 0.03608930855989456, 0.03376700356602669, 0.03760033845901489, 0.03431298956274986, 0.03695768862962723, 0.035676032304763794, 0.0362575501203537, 0.03286638855934143, 0.035152632743120193, 0.03907034918665886, 0.036353517323732376, 0.03378143906593323, 0.036968134343624115, 0.03637726604938507, 0.03454830124974251, 0.035086166113615036, 0.037560444325208664, 0.03771855682134628, 0.03696540743112564], [0.037736013531684875, 0.03882665932178497, 0.02291889302432537, 0.03147029131650925, 0.03533230721950531, 0.03526300564408302, 0.03884236887097359, 0.03867974504828453, 0.03461141139268875, 0.03631625324487686, 0.032643452286720276, 0.038644514977931976, 0.034144267439842224, 0.03741898015141487, 0.03586062416434288, 0.036772530525922775, 0.030705399811267853, 0.034902118146419525, 0.04121062159538269, 0.037122976034879684, 0.03302399814128876, 0.03795542195439339, 0.0368264801800251, 0.03281058371067047, 0.035041920840740204, 0.0383685901761055, 0.03877135366201401, 0.037779245525598526]]}
