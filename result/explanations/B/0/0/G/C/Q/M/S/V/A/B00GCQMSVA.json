"], "reviews": ["I discovered hyaluronic acid as a beauty product not too long ago and now consider it an essential part of my daily skin regimen.  This vitamin C serum also contains vitamin E and hyaluronic acid so I felt I would like it but did not imagine it would work as well as the hyaluronic acid.  I wanted to stay loyal to my original find and not give this the full five stars, but negative aspects are hard to find!Here are the comparisons I found:- this serum is indeed more a liquid than a gel.  This is neither a pro nor a con for me.  I find that the liquid seems to spread further and more easily, and yet I started with the gel first and like it immensely.- the pump on this serum seems easier to control than the one on my favorite hyaluronic acid.- this serum works really well; I do think the areas under my eyes responded slightly better to the other hyaluronic serum I used, but the difference is minimal.  Both make my pores smaller, moisturize well, and smooth my skin.I would encourage others to try several varieties and brands of highly rated beauty serums to see what works best for their individual skin.  I can recommend this as one of the serums to give a try.  Please do wait a few minutes for the serum to be absorbed before applying anything else.  Some users complain that these serums are sticky, but that stickiness goes away in just a few minutes, leaving your skin smooth.", "I got this for my best friend to use so he would stop trying to steal my own vitamin C serum and he loves it. Says it goes on nicely, isn't too thin or thick, not sticky at all. He didn't have any problems with it and is already seeing results on his face.", "reduced crows feet within 3 days. arizona kills my skin and day by day serum revives it like a pro. i love this stuff", "After trying numerous anti-aging products, I found vitamin C serums. All of the ones that use quality ingredients are helpful, but I've found the secret ingredient they must contain to be super effective is hyaluronic acid.This serum contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid  plus it contains a pump top. In my experience, most vitamin c serums come with a dropper bottle. I appreciated the pump top because it meant the product wasn't constantly being opened and exposed to air and light. Plus, it was way easier and cleaner to apply each  morning.I am happy with it.", "I've only been using this Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks now and so far, so good. This is not the first Vitamin C serum I have tried, I would say it's okay. I like that it doesn't have a fragrance and it's light. The pump dispenser is great, makes it a lot easier and less of a mess. I do wish it was thicker in consistency... It's almost like water. However, I didn't need a lot of this product, maybe two pumps, at the most, to get the job done. When I applied it to my face, it absorbed quickly into my skin without any residue and greasy feeling. I was able to apply my moisturizer almost right afterward. I haven't noticed a big difference with the fine lines (crows feet) around my eyes, but my skin does look a little brighter and it's definitely softer. Overall, I'm happy with the product and hope for more results as time goes by.Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.", "This is my first experience with a serum and I'm vet surprised about how well it works!Some background: we are late thirties, white, freckled, some fine wrinkles coming in over the last few years. Get focused on all natural and organic. After using for about two weeks here are our impressions:Way more moisturizedHealthy glowClean feelingFeels healthierEvened out freckles a little (noticeably)After user is totally recommend - and I was a skeptic! If you're looking at serum treatment I recommend this one for both the results and the price.A sample of this product was provided by the manufacturer for review.", "This is a wonderful vitamin C serum. It is really light, unlike some of the others I've tried which can be thick, heavily scented, or just weird in general. This one is nice and thin and clean, and sinks into the skin super fast so you can apply your moisturizer quickly after. The fact that it is basically scentless is great for my sensitive skin, and it has kept my skin nice and tight, even while on vacation to the beach. I'd definitely repurchase!", "I am very happy with this serum.  It is very easy to apply and has no odor or scent.  I use it at night after cleansing my face and before my night cream.  It seems to be helping my skin.  My skin feels softer and firmer.  I like that it includes vitamin E and Hyaluronic acid also.  A lot of other serums only have vitamin C.  Another thing I love about this serum is that it comes in a pump bottle.  Most come with a dropper.  The pump is more sanitary so you don&#8217;t contaminate the rest of the bottle every time you put the dropper back in it.  It also safeguards the possibility of spilling the bottle when you take the dropper out of it.  I can see results in that my fine lines and enlarged pores are diminishing.  I received a complimentary product in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "I am really loving this serum! It goes on so well, there is no fragrance that I can smell. My face seems brighter and my skin texture is smoother!", "I received one bottle of Day by Day Vitamin C Serum to review.  When I put it on my face it feels good, making my skin feel smooth.  I like the fact that it has a pump, instead of a dropper, so there is no chance of bacteria getting into the serum.  There are a lot of great ingredients, but there three ingredients that I would rather not use, which are Carbomer, Phenoxy- ethanol and Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.Ingredients:Ingredients: Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (Botanical Hyaluronic Acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Carbomer, Arginine, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phenoxy- ethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola Extract), Organic Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Plant Extract), Organic Pelagonium Gravoleons (Geranium Extract), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).", "The product works good and fast. Within a week you will see more results. It is not sticky or smiley. If you use sparingly it will dry fast and does not smell bad.", "One of the main differences I noticed between this and the other serums I've tried, is that this formulation is non-sticky, the perfect consistency - liquid but not too runny, and comes with a pump in the bottle instead of a dropper. Not only does the pump distribute the perfect amount for each use (which is a big deal for me since I tend to take more than I need) but it also minimizes the serum's contact with air and bacteria. It also comes in a pretty blue bottle, which I just thought was for looks, but it turns out the cobalt blue bottle minimizes exposure to light to keep the serum at its best.Some of the benefits I've noticed from this Vitamin C serum include: Hydration, tighter skin, even skin tone, and brighter complexion. I use this every night before putting on moisturizer. It feels nice and leaves my skin feeling fresh and youthful.", "My thoughts on this Vitamin C Serum, I love how it works, so let me tell you why. I read some of the reviews on this vitamin C serum & the negatives seemed mostly about cost & size & that to me is strange since almost all the vitamin C serums I have tried & read aboutd were the same size & similar price, after all a little goes a very long way, so yes less is more with this vitamin C serum.I love it has a pumper instead of a dropper, yes that does not make it work better but boy it does make it easier to use.  I noticed it brightening & evening my skin tone, plus the way my skin looked & elasticity of my skin felt great after just a few uses. Just as they promise it does &#34;Beautifies your Face&#34;. Thank you", "I paired this with a phytoceramides oral supplement and got noticeable results starting after 3 weeks.  This vitamin C serum stimulates production of collagen, and that makes skin appear younger because it makes it more elastic.  Sample provided.", "I always know that I'm using a good facial product when I've used it for a few months and as the bottle gets low I start panicking about ordering a new bottle.  This Vitamin C serum is definitely a product like that.  I've been using it for a while and it seems to really make my skin feel hydrated.  When I use it before my moisturizer it really makes the moisturizer go farther and penetrate deeper.  It's not a miracle product (nothing is) but it does make my skin seem softer and brighter.I will definitely be getting more of this!", "This vitamin C serum by Day By Day Beauty is amazing! It's very hydrating for your skin and gentle. It's easy to use and helps shrink pores!", "This Vitamin C Serum comes in a dark blue glass bottle and it contains 1 fl oz. of product. It has a medium to thin consistency and applies very easily. You are only supposed to use a little bit and I use two or three squirts per application. After a couple weeks of use the bottle is only about 1/3 gone so it should last me between 1 1/2 and 2 months. It has very little scent and I would describe what little smell there is as a clean scent. There is no dye or heavy scent to irritate sensitive skin. It contains a combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid and a variety of other ingredients. The combination comes together nicely and makes a very moisture rich serum that is very beneficial to my skin.I have been using this Vitamin C Serum in combination with myDerma Roller - Micro Needle Roller with Advanced 360 ROTATING HEAD SCRATCH PREVENTION - 600 Disc Technology Micro-Needles skin care therapy dermatology system. SAFE FOR HOME USE. Use microneedeling for Anti Ageing, wrinkles, Eyes, body, Hair Loss, Acne...I have been using a derma roller for a couple weeks now and it makes my face hurt a little after using it. My skin also feels really dry after using it. This serum is perfect for applying directly after a derma roller treatment to quickly add moisture and vitamins back to my pores. I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for about two weeks now and it took a little time but I am truly seeing results now. I think more so than with any other routine that I have tried so far. I usually have dry skin around my nose that it has eliminated and I have fine lines on my forehead that really bug me and it has reduced them a little already.Overall I think this is a great serum that really works and provides a true benefit. It helps me to look my absolute best and I look forward to continuing using it and seeing how much it will improve my appearance over an extended period of time.Sample provided for review.", "I believe in taking my time to review and talk about skin care products. It is simply because those types of products need time to truly see the results and to reflect on their true benefit. Truly something that cannot be done overnight. Despite what they claim.I also find that the review might change dramatically from one day to another. For example I may like the moisturizer one day but the next day may wake up with a rash.Needless to say the best way to review skin care is simply to wait.Today I am going against the code. Why? On May 13th, 2014 I received my Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum. A serum can make me go against my code? Yes, very much so. Here is why.This vitamin c serum is a triple threat made with the finest quality Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Hyaluronic Acid. Key ingredients in the fight against age spots, wrinkles, and those stubborn fine lines.  Along side those power house ingredients are also Aloe, and Jojoba Oil; which deeply hydrate and heel skin. Giving you hydrated, clear, soft, supple, and simply gorgeous skin. The best ingredients to truly benefit and target the key problems all us women and men share. It is such a power house of ingredients with true benefits and yet so gentle.  Making it a essential part of the skin care routine for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and can not always use these types of products but I have found even after daily use I have had no sensitivities what so ever.The formula itself  is a thin clear consistency, odor free and your skin just drinks it in. My skin is so hydrated, soft, firm and so vibrant after using it only for two weeks. It has truly benefited my skin and will surely be part of my skin care regiment for years to come. I am truly a fan and I believe if you try it you will be too.", "Vitamin C Serums are a great way to prep the skin for moisturizer as all of the serums I&#8217;ve tried contain Hyaluronic acid, which is able to swell and hold a LOT of water, which is great for (dry) skin.I always have chronically dry skin which can make even the lightest foundation look cakey if I&#8217;m not careful. But since I started using Vitamin C Serums a couple months ago, my skin has been a LOT less flaky than it was.There is no strong fragrance to this serum and just has a slight medicinal scent which is likely from the Witch Hazel that it contains. I hate strong fragrances and appreciate a more natural smelling skincare.If you are looking for a great vitamin C serum look no further!", "I have tried out several vitamin C serums over the last several months, and this is my favorite so far. I love that this is light, unscented, not sticky or greasy. It comes in a fairly big bottle and a little goes a long way, so it seems to be a good value. I also like the pump method rather than the dropper. It comes out cleanly without drips.In terms of results, I've seen the same results with all the ones I've tried: It DOES make a difference, though not a tremendous one for me. I don't see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes, but I do see a general smoother appearance to my skin.", "\"I have aging, sun damaged, combination skin.  I'm especially concerned with how dry the skin around my eyes seems to be and the accompanying crows feet.  I've tried a LOT of products, from drugstore, to department store, to mail order.  I was given the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review and figured I had nothing to lose by trying it.The serum is very thin, almost watery.  It comes in a pump bottle, and you only need about half a pump for your entire face.  I learned to pump it directly onto my forehead and spread from there, otherwise it runs all over my hand.I've been using the serum for almost a week.  I use it at night after washing my face and exfoliating every other day.  It's my first layer, before a couple of night creams, one containing hyaluronic acid.  The only part of my routine that's changed is the underlayer of the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum.Holy Smokes!  After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin felt better in the morning.  It's softer, and feels moisturized.  That's different--usually my skin feels dry in the morning, sometimes with a greasy coating of stuff that my skin didn't absorb.  The serum seems to help the other creams fully penetrate my skin.  After five days, my skin looks great.  The BB cream that I use instead of foundation is going on more evenly, and I don't need as much.The ultimate was a lady at church last Sunday morning who peered at me and said, \"\"How OLD are you?  You don't have any wrinkles around your eyes!\"\"That was probably a function of lighting and angle, because of course I rushed home, peered at myself in the bathroom mirror, and found lots of wrinkles, but I will say that compliments on my skin from comparative strangers have never happened before.  Coincidence?I don't hold out much hope for long term wrinkle eradication, though that would be nice.  Miracles can happen, but I'll settle for a serum that both works and seems to make everything else work better.  For the price, this is great stuff!\"", "I recently turned 40 I am trying to keep my face looking younger, not that I even look 40.

I can wear this all day with no greasy feeling by the end of the day. You also do not need much, it goes a long way.", "This comes in a bottle, with the pump separate, which is great packaging, since the product is less likely to be wasted during treatment and I don't have to worry about figuring out how to 'unlock' a pump.The product itself is clear, and a bit watery.  It absorbs quickly.I'm not sure what strength Vit. C it is, but it is lower than some products that I have used that turned my skin red.  This does not irritate my skin at all, so I think it is fairly low strength.I was using a $28 moisturizer that just was not working, in fact, my skin had started going backwards and looking older.  I jumped when I saw an affordable promotion on this serum.I quit when this came in and started using this with Aveno Positively ageless at night, which is one that i find affordable and effective.  it is doing even better with this serum.  In just a bit less than 2 weeks, my skin is showing definite improvement.The product absorbs in and is pleasant enough to use,and doesn't have an annoying scent.  It is very gentle and I've not had any irritation, which I expected a bit since I am sensitive to high concentrations of Vit. C.I find following it with a good moisturizer, as directed, is very important, but it does seem to boost the results of my favorite moisturizer.  The best serum I personally have used had caviar extract in it, but it was 3x this cost.  This is a nice serum for this price range.", "I've been left with some nasty scars I've been anxious to fade. When my Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C serum showed up a few weeks ago, I started using it morning and night immediately, to see if I'd start seeing results quickly.I was completely impressed to see a difference with in days, Yeah, you read that right, within days! I've tried so many fancy creams for fading sun spots and acne scars, and while some do work well, most do not, and even the good ones can take months before you start seeing a difference, not to mention you're using harsh chemicals to do it.Vitamin C Serum's naturally brighten the skin, reverse the effects of sun damage by lightening and fading those ugly sun spots, clarify the skin, restore skin's elasticity, helps the skin retain moisture, minimizes the size of pores, even reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It's truly an ALL-IN-ONE beauty product that works naturally, effectively, and is a whole lot cheaper than a lot of skin care products out there.Because Day by Day Beauty's Vitamin C Serum is natural, it's safe for all skin types too. Sensitive skin types rejoice! You know how hard it is to find skin care products that will fade those sun spots while still being soft and gentle to your extra sensitive skin!What I love about the serum, is it is super lightweight too. I washed my face morning and night, squirted a drop on to my fingers (only takes one for me) and blotted it over my face. My skin soaked it up within minutes. Because its also naturally moisturizing, this is a great product for those with oily skin as well. You probably won't even need a moisturizer besides this serum. Because my skin is dry, I still needed to apply my moisturizer after, but I still found this serum to be quite moisturizing for my extra dry skin.This serum is also not sticky at all, which I've tried a few other Vitamin C serums, and often times they can be, so I really loved that this one is not sticky in the least.You will also find no parabens, alcohol, or fillers in this product. AND its cruelty-free! Yay!I've been using this product for a few weeks now and have been so happy with the results. My acne scars have faded significantly, even so that even my husband noticed this last week and commented on it! Also, I have been out in the sun a bunch lately and always get new sun spots this time of year. I had some pop up a week ago right under my eyes and a little bit above my upper lip. First off, I was like, Ok I need to be applying sunscreen better here, so I started doing that, but normally every summer, when these sun spots pop up, I can expect to see them until fall. Amazingly enough, over the last week while using my Day by Day anti aging vitamin c serum, those sun spots completely disappeared! I wish I would've thought to take a before and after picture!I'm beyond impressed, because like I said, new sun spots I get in the summer, tend to stick around until fall, and somehow all three of these spots faded completely within a week. I can't even tell that they are there now! Absolutely amazing!I don't always see such great results with beauty products, in fact its usually hard to test them out for a few weeks and notice much of a difference, but Vitamin C serum's are completely where it's at! I always notice a big difference, and almost immediately, when using one!I'm loving the Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum and have been so happy and pleased with the results, I know this is a serum I will be using forever! Seriously! I'm that impressed with it! If there is one beauty product I'd recommend to everyone, Vitamin C serum is absolutely it, and you can't go wrong with Day by Day Beauty's Vitamin C formula!", "\"I recently decided to try the Vitamin C Serum from Day By Day Beauty. It comes in a 1oz bottle which seems small but a little goes a long way. The bottle is tightly capped and a pump dispenser is included to switch too after opening. I liked this as it makes it more hygenic.The serum has a nice \"\"slip\"\" to it. It does not feel greasy at all. It absorbs quickly into the skin. After first use my skin felt softer.A few years ago I used a scrubbing tool on my neck. Though the tool was designed for the skin, it roughed up my skin and it has never been the same. I tried a variety of lotions and creams on it including alpha hydroxy acids but nothing worked. To my surprise this has smoothed the area down more than anything else. It is not gone but it is much better.I have not noticed a reduction in wrinkles, but I have only used it a short time, perhaps that will come in the future. I think this would be an excellent product to use after a skin procedure also when the skin can absorb it fully.It is also clear from the Q&A; on this product that the owners care about what they are selling and servicing it. Really nice to see that.Overall, a super nice product at a good price point. I look forward to seeing more results as I use it longer.\"", "This vitamin C skin serum from Day by Day Beauty is clear and very slightly viscous, with a clean scent, primarily of witch hazel.  It is bottled in beautiful cobalt blue apothecary glass to protect it from the light, with a pump cap for easy application.  It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas.  It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.The mostly botanical formula is 72% organic and contains vitamins C & E, as well as vegetarian hyaluronic acid. Other ingredients include aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin.There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.A review sample was provided for testing and evaluation.", "Since I hit 40, I became pretty serious with my skin. I've used a lot of creams to moisturize and hydrate my skin and lately, I've joined the bandwagon and started using Vitamin C Serum. I like its effect on my skin; so soft and smooth and it doesn't leave my face looking shiny. And unlike other serums that I've used, this one comes with a pump; easy and convenient. The consistency is just perfect and you only need to use a small amount to cover your face and neck. I have a few dark spots and I noticed that they have become lighter. This serum is simply amazing!", "I like to wash my face in the shower and that's it.  I never put anything other than sunscreen on my face, so this was a challenge.  It&#8217;s a small bottle but it only uses a little to completely cover your face and neck.My face has som sun damage in the form of tiny brown sports that get nicked when I shave.  I also have large pores on my nose from teenage acne.  My neck has plenty of scratches and nicks.  After applying this material for five days in a row after I shower, I am really stunned at what it does.  My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother.  In fact, my entire face looks smoother.  And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin.  It looks and feels invisible.I did not expect anything to happen, but this was a real surprise.  I already plan to order another bottle.  So I'm vain, but who doesn't want to look their best?  It seems to be pricey but I figure this will last a month if used every day.  You don't need much.  Product supplied for an honest review.", "My Thoughts on This ProductSo, not only is the blue glass pretty-I've said it in previous posts, I love blue glass-but it also helps minimize exposure to the light (in case you have your bottle in a brightly-lit room). That's a great idea. I also love the pump top. Not only does it make it easier to use, but it also minimizes contact with bacteria. Another plus since I don't want to expose the serum or my skin to extra bacteria. Yuck.Scented? No. Natural, organic ingredients? Yes, love that.Aside from pretty packaging, how about the consistency? Well, what I noticed about this particular serum is that it is very watery. I have to really cup my hand when I pump it out because it will drip right off if I'm not careful. Not sure I like that too much.However, on my actual face, it does work well. My skin does absorb it fine, it causes no irritation whatsoever. My skin does look clearer, brighter, and I do have smaller pores. Very good product as far as it's results, I just which it wasn't as watery. Maybe if there was a bit more hyaluronic acid added in so the formula is thicker.I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. However, all opinions expressed are solely my own and in no way influenced.", "This is already a combination of Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C which is what we normally apply after using a dermaroller.  The bottle is 1 fl oz, enough to last for weeks. It is thinner in consistency compared to what we prefer which is more like gel. Gel is less messy and easier to apply on the face.  Other than that, it looks and feel good on the skin as what we were using.  A moisturizer is recommended to use after application.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.", "My wife and I were regular users of a variety of other products costing much more than this product.  We both found this product as good or better than much more expensive products.  In my case, I use the product mainly for some very fine facial scarring that many mistake for wrinkles.  This serum is a perfect consistency and the spray applicator (overlooked by many other brands), makes application very easy.  Unlike my previous experiences, both my wife and I agree there is less of an oily feel after application.  Our skin feels and looks tighter (I find I have to shave first however) and hydrates the skin very well. My fine scars do not disappear.  However, they appear less noticeable even when scrutinized under very good lighting. Ib both our cases, it took about 10 days of regular use to achieve what we believe are good results. I use the product as a stand alone while my wife will use the product in conjunction with her regular routine products.We can definitely recommend this product.  Just keep in mind, everyone is different and your results may vary.  In our case, my wife is light skin- fair complexion while I am darker skinned not so fair complexion (Irish versus Italian).", "I was given a free sample of this product to test.  It's a relatively new product by a new company so when I went online to see how other consumers were feeling about it, I was troubled by the fact that there were so many reviews already, and most of them 5 stars.  Smelled fishy to me that so many reviews (214 as I write this) have appeared since November 2013.  Obviously some big time marketing has been going on.So, skeptical about the serum but committed to trying it, I've been using it for more than a month now and have to say that it works well for me.It's in a small bottle (1 oz.), very dark blue to protect the contents from light, with a pump dispenser.  The product is described as a serum but it is less viscous and more watery than most serums I've used, so care is needed when pumping it onto the finger.  It can drip easily.  But that doesn't have anything to do with its effectiveness or absorbability.It absorbs into the skin quickly and then I apply my usual moisturizer.  (Just using the serum isn't enough to keep my skin hydrated.) I've been using this at least once a day, often twice, for more than a month and I'm satisfied with the results.  It seems to smooth the skin and tighten pores with an effect similar to that of#1 Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum - 100% Pure, Undiluted & No Fillers - Ultimate Skin Rejuvenator & Moisturizer HA Serum - Best Anti Wrinkle Serum with Vitamin C - Nutrient-Rich Organic Herbs For BETTER Results - Enhances Collagen Growth - Best Hyaluronic..., another product I've tested recently. However, this Day by Day serum has a slight edge over that other one because it contains fewer and less objectionable ingredients.The bottle is small but lasts a good while.  As I said, I've been using this for more than a month and believe that I have half left.  (Hard to tell because the bottle is not transparent.)  That means I probably have another month of use.  After it's gone I may be inclined to purchase the product again.
