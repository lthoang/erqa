Has a nice heft for the size. I know it's in my pocket- and I don't have to fish around for it like I would my lighter-weight Swiss Army mini-knife.Even the key ring is slim and streamlined.The fold out clippers fold out with a nice crisp \"\"snap\"\" -- they are nice and sharp and do a great job clipping nails. The scissors are similar to what I have on my Swiss Army mini knife but the scissor's spring is MUCH nicer on the Swilling, flush with one of the scissor's arms - I doubt it will break as easily as the SA scissors spring seems to do. However, the scissors are short and not as sharp or streamlined, not as maneuverable (finger and toenails) in getting the job done as my SA knife scissors do.The Zwillig has a nice sharp knife and the file and screwdriver edge are very good for their size. But the knife lacks a tweezer and toothpick -- I find that disappointing -- even though this knife appears to have enough space for one of each. That's a minus in my book - the tweezer and toothpick have been indispensable to me, out in the field or even everyday use.\"", "The size is PERFECT for going in my purse, and it has all the little gadgets I need periodically.  Clippers, tiny scissors, tiny file replaces all the junk I dump in my bag, and they all work and in a small package.  Quality is solid - there's nothing cheap feeling about this.  I also think this would make a great little stocking stuffer kind of gift!", "Contains the following tools:Nail file + small screwdriver, small knife, scissors, nail clipper & key chain.Material, stainless steelThe small knife is not for anything heavy duty and could use a sharpening, otherwise it works well for small tasks.  The scissors are nice to have as my regular swiss army knife does not have them.  The spring for the scissors is strong and well made.  In addition, the scissors are rounded tip for added safety.  The nail clipper works well but takes a bit to get used to it.Small and convenient pocket tool.  I carry it daily.", "This is a compact (2 4/8&#34; L x 3/4&#34; W x 1/2&#34; D not including key ring), lightweight (only 5.25 oz) keychain compatible multi-tool plus nail clipper is perfect for your Every Day Carry (EDC).  It has an impressively sharp compact nail clipper, a mini blade, a nail file, a pair of mini micro-serrated scissors and of course the key ring.  All of this is surrounded with &#34;Swiss Army Red&#34; casing which helps it stand out in the depths of a dark bag.  The one surprise is that while this carries the Zwilling Logo, it is not made in Germany but in South Korea.  However, it is still very sharp and seems as well made as my older made-in-Germany Zwilling implements.  I will report back as to the longevity of this item.Perfect as an Every Day Carry item for yourself or as a stocking stuffer or thoughtful gift for a friend.", "Found this small type of look alike Swiss Army Knife so handy to carry on my keychain. This is ideal for a man or woman to keep as an emergency took on a keychain. The sections that I find best are:+ Nail clipper &#8211; I have nails that grow fast, but then they break off fast as well. This tool I use the most as I never seem to find a nail clipper when I need one! Works OK. Could be a tad sharper.+ Nail File &#8211; Another one of those tools I seen to need but never have one hand, now I do. This one works well!+ Tiny Knife Blade &#8211; I tried this out on a small apple and orange and it was sharp enough to cut up my apple (I washed it thoroughly so I could get the peel). Then I used the sharp blade to help me peel my navel orange and it did a good job. It was easy them to section the orange and eat it.+ Scissors &#8211; Meh! Could not get these to work right. This is not really a favorite. But I did get the edge off a wrapper with the scissors so in a pinch&#8230;you get the picture.My rating of this is 4.6 stars because I did find that the quality was very good (but did not like the scissors on it).", "The problem I have with this is every part of it is so small it's very hard to use any of the features. I also didn't realize it had a small knife, I thought it didn't. So I can't take this with on a plane. The scissors are so tiny it's hard to even start to cut the edge of a piece of paper much less anything else. This seems more like a toy but not a good one and not one for children. Even the nail file does not do a good job. I just don't know why anyone would buy this instead of a larger size that you could actually use the items it has.", "I am disappointed with the quality of the Zwilling Pour Homme Stainless Steel Multi-Use Tool.  As the owner and operator of various small tools, this one remains nowhere near the top in my opinion.  The red color is a nice true red, but considering the minimal number of &#34;blades&#34; included in this one, the design is weak.  I have a very old stainless blade and nail clipper that operates similar to this one, yet that is solid and less than half the thickness of this one.  It's also much easier than this one to lift the clipper into functioning mode.  I would only recommend this one to someone who wants a red tool and finds the dimensions to be desirable.  For me, what it offers could be housed in a much smaller design.  I do like the key ring, however, because the flat design is sleek.", "I'd always know Zwilling as a German company that made high quality blade tools for the kitchen and body, such as kitchen knives and nail scissors so I was glad to try this out.This is basically a Swiss Army knife type of tool they call a multi-use tool. Included in the tool set are only 4 things: nail clipper, blade, file and scissors.This is the first time I've seen nail clippers in a Swiss Army knife type because they are hard to completely fold up but this is a good design. The clippers are folded up compactly and are sharp and cut well. Likewise the file and blade are fold out nicely. The scissors are have rounded tip which is useful for certain applications.Overall, a high quality penknife with beauty applications.", "The good news: If you're looking for a keychain sized grooming tool, then this is definitely what you're looking for.  Although it's tiny, I thought the included nail clippers, mini scissors, and file worked well.The bad news: I'm not sure quite what this is for.  With the included knife, I don't think you can carry this on a plane, so it's not great for travel.  And overall, a simple nail clipper is less pricey, and a micro-knife like one of the Victorinox minis is more useful for everything except nail clipping.But with that said, if you are looking for a mini-groomer, this will definitely do the job.  Recommended for that use only.", "\"I am not a \"\"homme\"\" but this is a fairly handy gadget anyway.  It is small and the ring allows it to be clipped to a key chain.  It is a little less practical for clipping to a purse ring without a quick release because it's too awkward to remove the ring when you want to use it.Overall, I don't think this is as practical as carrying a multi-tool pocket knife.  The clippers are nice, but the nail file didn't work well for me.  Assuming that the user is going to use this for a quick touch up and not actual nail grooming, I don't see the point of a file that doesn't work well *and* clippers.I was surprised that the little scissors do seem to work well, but I'd think anyone with large hands (like the aforementioned hommes)would have trouble using them.  The knife is quite sharp and works pretty well for a tiny blade.A nice idea, a nice size, but would have been more practical with a modification of the tools included.  I think I'll stick to my other red-handled, famous name pocketknife combo.  Pricing was not available at the time this review was written, but price in comparison to similar products would be an important consideration.\"", "This is a handy addition to anyone's keychain. It always bothers me that items like this are marketed to men, because I am not a an last time I checked. Hold on -- I'll check again. Nope, not a man. However, I have had small tools like this on my keychain. This one is especially handy because it has a nail clipper, which is easily the most stolen item in my home. If I have a nice, new, SHARP nail clipper, someone whose name shall not be revealed feels a need to cut his nasty nails on my lovely new clipper, leaving them tainted with nail fungus and no longer sharp, due to the toenails he has in place of fingernails. And that is what I fear is going to be the Achilles Heel of this lovely little tool.Forgetting the clippers, the tool is really nice. It's made of stainless steel, unlike a whole lot of similar tools. The blade are very sharp and should retain that edge for quite a while. The file is simple, made of many parallel cuts, but it works well on my fingernail, as long as I'm not looking for manicure-grade filing. The pair of scissors works for the occasional label or flower, but for most tasks, I'd use the knife.Two missing articles are the tweezers and the toothpick (or tiny pen, depending on the knife) I know that the knife is a Zwilling, not a Swiss Army, but these items seem mandatory on such a keychain-sized tool. They lose a start for that reason and because the clippers will lose their edge many moons before the knife and cannot be resharpened, as far I know. (If they can. please let me know in a comment) Regardless they do earn their space on your keychain, not matter what gender you are.It's a very handy tool, and makes a nice gift for anyone, but isn't 100% perfect.", "My husband has the Swiss Army Knife brand of a tiny size pocket tool like this and I have just found it very nice to use so this looked much the same so I ordered it.First of all the good news - the clippers, scissors, nail file and small knife do work well and can clip/file your nails cut even a little heavy paper and the knife open a cardboard box.The bad news?  Except for the clippers -- which took some finagling to get loose -- the knife, scissors and nail file were all very difficult to pull out of the holder!Just not worth the price!", "This is a keychain multi tool, with a small knife blade, small scissors, and screwdriver/file. It also has a fold-out nail clipper and a large keyring. There are two obvious competitors to this tool as far as function and quality goes: the ubiquitous Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD, and the Wenger Swiss Army Nail Clipper. Both are technically produced by Victorinox since Wenger is a subsidiary.This tool is about the same width and length as the Classic SD, but substantially thicker. It's comparable in size to the Wenger. The tool is actually not much heavier than the SD despite its larger bulk. Overall, the quality of the tools is fine- the blade is sharp and fine for light duty work like opening boxes. I especially like the size of the keyring and the fact that (unlike the SD) the blade and file folds away from it. This makes it a lot easier to use if attached to your keys- never did understand why Victorinox has yet to address this in their model.The nail clipper is fine but pretty small. It's spring loaded and pops out of the handle, unlike the Wenger's which folds out like the other tools. It works if you don't have one available, though I'll add that it is considerably cheaper (and TSA-safe) to just get a normal nail clipper with a hole in it. This item won't pass screening due to the knife blade.There are a few significant downsides to this vs. its competition. The handle is hollow plastic to save weight, but feels cheap and doesn't afford as good tool grip as either the Vic or Wenger (primarily due to the nailclipper being there). The SD doesn't have a nail clipper but is about half the price and has a toothpick and tweezers. The Wenger is only slightly more expensive and is better built in general. The biggest problem with the Zwilling tool though, is the fact that all the tools save the nail clipper are very difficult to open. The standard fingernail grooves are simply not deep enough and the tools are too recessed when folded into the handle. This makes them very difficult to open with your thumbnails (which is typical) and very clumsy in general if your nails are cut short. This is ironic as I'm pretty sure 'pour homme' means it's marketed for men, who typically don't have dagger-like nails. I was planning on using this on my keychain in place of my SD since the clipper is handy, but the difficulty in opening the other tools changed my mind. Comparing this aspect to the Vic, it's literally night and day.Overall, this is an okay pocket tool but I'd say it's worth paying a few extra bucks and getting the Wenger if you really want a nail clipper. If you don't, the SD is both better and cheaper."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07419297099113464, 0.08208416402339935, 0.07175444066524506, 0.06382045149803162, 0.08557135611772537, 0.0868304967880249, 0.06272827088832855, 0.07839148491621017, 0.07712053507566452, 0.0707201287150383, 0.0758955329656601, 0.08633719384670258, 0.08455292135477066]]}
