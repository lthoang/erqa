It goes on evenly and is light enough to use under other creams/lotions. I used it every morning and night right after washing my face but before  my usual creams.I noticed a big improvement in my skin brightness and an improvement in discoloration. I had ruddy patches on my cheeks and two red &#34;scars&#34; from a chemical peel burn on my upper lip that completely faded away. I have used it for about a month.I am happy with the ingredients! It is hard to find a high percentage of vitamin C, E and hyaluranic acid in one bottle.The only downside is the smell. To  me it smelled a little like rubber cement. The good news is that the smell goes away almost immediately, but I found it a little unpleasant each time.I still have every wrinkle I had before using the serum, but I am hopeful they will begin to lighten over time. Either way, I am very happy with the improvements in skin tone and discoloration.", "I really have been loving my Vit C serum. Not only is it great for lightening my dark spots, but I can feel a little better knowing it is organic as well. The dropper lets me apply as much or as little as i want to my face without waste. It absorbs quickly so I can move on with the rest of my face routine both day and night. No harsh smells so it's great for me. The additional Hyaluronic Acid is know to help with would healing so when i have those &#34;tiny&#34; (not) breakouts this helps clam it down.", "The container I received was 1 fl oz. and has a price tag of $35.95 (scary, I know!).At times, I can have a very greasy face, but then it can be so dry that it starts peeling like crazy. Therefore, I was a little hesitant to try this product because I was assuming the minute that I got the product; I would have a greasy face. When the product arrived, I had dry, flaky, peeling skin. There are certain spots that are worse for me, like around my eyebrows, near my hairline, above my lip and just underneath my chin. I made sure to focus on those areas when I used the Vitamin C. A few drops of the Vitamin C Serum will go a long ways, so do not think you need to use a ton. The serum soaked right into my skin, but it was because it was so dry.There really was not a scent to the product, which I was happy about. Sometimes having scented facial products can really irritate my skin as well as my allergies.I am very happy with Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum. My skin feels healthier and looks so much better. It is definitely moisturized and smoother feeling.So, remember that scary price tag that I mentioned earlier? Well, with Amara Organics Vitamin C, you do not need to use a lot, so the bottle will last you for a very long time!Overall, I am thrilled with this product and would definitely recommend to anyone that has dry skin or is just looking to make their skin feel and look healthier.**Was sent the product for review**", "This product left my skin very soft, almost like a moisturizer would. Over a few weeks I noticed dark spots and acne scarring had started to lighten up and almost disappear. I am very pleased with this serum!", "I love using natural vitamin C serum on my skin & this product is amazing, I love that it has Vitamin E in it as my skin always responds very favorably to vitamin E & the combo with the C really makes my skin look & feel amazing. This product is great at getting rid of discoloration as well. Do your skin a favor & try it, I have only had it a few weeks but I like it so far", "This serum is liquid like water but applying is a snap- I just take some product out with the applicator- drop it into my palms and then quickly apply it on my face and neck (BTW: I also put it on the backside of my hands). It dries in under 1 minute and has no feel whatsover to it- not greasy not oily or sticky- just like water. You can just follow up with any moisturizer, primer or foundation or whatever you regularly do and you will not feel any difference. But the serum will do it's magic! I am very pleased with this product. I am a true Vitamin C Serum believer and that this product also includes Vitamin E AND Hyaluronic Acid makes this product a top pick when choosing a serum! I got this product as part of an advertorial.", "This product I simply love on my skin. It makes it feel so soft and also as a bonus helped me with some the redness my face has. A+++ This is a great product!", "\"I love using cosmetics, but what I love even more is when I know they are natural, made in the USA, and good for my skin. Amara Organics gave me the opportunity to review their Vitamin C serum. (Sample sent to me) Vitamin C is wonderful to take internally, however, it has been found that topical use often works even better. I have tried various Vitamin C serums, and so far have lucked out, they all have worked nicely for me. This brand is no exception. Amara Organics Vitamin C serum is sold exclusively at Amazon.com.Amara's serum includes Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E for extra powerful anti-aging effects. Hyaluronic acid is an excellent moisturizer that restores skins firmness, natural resilience and is beneficial for skin health. Vitamin E is essential for wound healing, it lubricates the skin and forms a protective barrier. Vitamin E also promotes collagen production, which is necessary for anti-aging and restoring of skin elasticity. Vitamin C Reduces inflammation and improves cell renewal. One of the first places that is usually affected by wrinkles and fine lines is the skin underneath our eyes. This skin is thin and delicate, and should be handled with care. I am not yet showing wrinkles on my skin, however, my eyelids and under eye area have some slight loss of elasticity and I always make sure to apply my Vitamin C serum and other oils delicately. It is important to use your ring finger when applying around the eye area as this finger tends to have the least amount of strength and puts the least amount of pressure and tugs less.This plant-based serum is a lightweight and fragrance free formula with no parabens, no alcohol, and no animal testing. Made in the USA. It is a watery aloe vera like consistency and is not sticky or greasy. I like how it soaks in almost immediately. I recommend this serum if you are looking for a Vitamin C serum to try. It seems to compare well with other high quality Vitamin C serums I have tried. I have been testing it out for about 2 weeks with no irritation and no breakouts. My skin is soft and not dried out. I have a natural glow to my skin that seems to be from using Vitamin C serum, paired with lots of hydration from drinking plenty of water.The company has a no hassle full satisfaction policy:\"\"WORKS OR YOUR MONEY BACK Manufacturer's Guarantee: We back our products up with a 365-day hassle-free money back guarantee, no matter where you buy our product.

You will love this serum because it really does work and it's not as expensive as some of the other name brands that I have tried in the past. So, it's a good cost effective serum that you can feel good about.If you have some environmental skin damage, then this serum can help without you going thru those costly and painful procedures at the dermatologist's office. I used to go every few years to have some of the minor ones, never did the lasers, but those others still were quite painful. I decided to stop and just seek out the best skincare and just let nature do it's thing. I am so glad I did because it's really not worth all the stuff you go thru plus the cost when you can get some of the same results with good quality skincare products.", "I received Vitamin C Serum For Face in exchange for honest review from Tomoson.I wanted to review the product because of the benefits. Anti-aging, collaging-boosting, moisturizer, and vitamin c. I am getting older and my kids are driving me crazier. I also love the benefits of vitamin c. Vitamin C helps fight infections. Rubbing vitamin c paste on a cold sore or blister helps swelling go down faster. Vitamin C helps with vision and inflammation.The Serum is easy to apply. The serum comes with an syringe applicator. You simply squeeze out a little and rub it on your face. The serum does not feel heavy on your skin. The serum is not greasy or oily or leaves your skin filmy.I have been using the product for a few weeks now. My skin looks healthier.After reading the reviews on Amazon, I applied the serum to some dry, discolorations on my arm today."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08678789436817169, 0.06045610457658768, 0.09071981906890869, 0.10247199237346649, 0.09455626457929611, 0.12096673995256424, 0.11650998145341873, 0.11688379943370819, 0.09851738810539246, 0.1121300533413887]]}
