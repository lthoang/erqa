I have found that most NAS devices have complex or laggy web interfaces that made them a pain to use.  Not this, the interface is smooth and works great (using it on a Mac with Safari).  You can easily setup the Cloud storage (which allows users to access the drive remotely using the WD app or a web interface connecting directly to the drive over your Internet (I disabled this since I am paranoid about security and do not like open ports that are not a major necessity on my Firewall).  The unit I received had 8TB (using RAID 5 gives me a usable 5.94 TB, however, RAID 5 should be faster than spanning and and much better usability over having each individual drive).  I created a password for the admin account (built in not cloud) so that I could use the admin account in Finder for logging into the drive (which showed up instantly under SHARED in Finder).  It had a special drive setup (that was also under SHARED) for Time Machine, but I disabled that in the Settings since I have another ThunderBolt drive that handles TimeMachine.The drive uses 4 2TB drives that have (from what I see) a 5400 RPM speed, which is pretty basic, but I am assuming they did that for the heat.  I still have excellent write speed and since this works over a network you are already limited by what the network can handle.  The device is a tad large, but since it has 4 desktop drives in it that is to be expected.  The drives are easy to eject and come out smoothly. The LCD display gives you basic information on the unit (most importantly IP address), and can easily be browsed with the two buttons.I saved the admin login to Keychain and this allows me to have the admin account automatically login whenever Finder finds the drive on the network.  I have not had any problem connecting to it since Finder always finds it at boot.Since this works over a network you will experience different write/read speeds due to network speeds.  My Mac has Wireless N wifi and my Cisco router also supports full speeds on N, but I would get better speeds from a Gigabit Ethernet connection.  You may also improve the connection by setting up QOS to give this and your main computer priority on your network so it gets faster connections.  The drive also have two USB 3.0 ports and two network ports.  The USB ports allow you to add storage if needed and the two network connections allow for a failsafe if a network cable/adapter fails and for multitasking across the two network drives (multi tasking options are in the Network settings).  The unit also has two power ports, I assume this is for a backup in case one fails, but since the unit only has one power cable included I assume you need to purchase another one to use this backup.The main benefit of this unit is the web interface.  It is so easy to use.  The interface is clean and elegant and provides everything you need in an easy to understand flow that allows for anyone to use this, regardless of computing knowledge.You can easily create users (there is support for Active Directory).  You can also create folders (under Share) and specify what users have what rights to each folder.  This makes an easy to use setup for offices or home users with multiple people.  You would than login with that user in Finder or Explore in Windows to see the available folders.In the end this is a great unit.  It offers a nice size (expandable) storage with an easy to use interface.  It allows for quick setup of users and allows for root level folders to be setup for quick security levels for multi user environments.  It also supports sharing your content over the cloud (using the WD service), however, I disables this since I am paranoid about security (I trust WD, but do not like having open ports on my Firewall for services that are non essential).  You can also setup media folders for media sharing with support for iTunes and WMP/WMC and any other unit that works on one of those protocols (for example PS3 can see WMP servers).  In the end this is a great working unit with an amazing interface.  It works as expected and is great for fast access to network resources across multiple devices.  Highly recommend!", "This is a network storage system for home use or small businesses. It consists of a black box with 4 2Tb drives, giving up to 8 Tb of storage depending on what options you choose for RAID. Also included inside the package is an Ethernet cable, a power supply cable, and a 1-page foldout quick start guide. I was a bit dubious about the quick start guide, having struggled for hours with a similar Seagate device. However, it worked! I plugged in the cables as shown in the guide. I entered the address printed in the guide into my web browser. As shown in the guide, that brought up a website with a link to download software for the storage device. I installed the software and I was up and running--just like that! All told, from unpacking to copying my first file onto the new device took about 20 minutes, with no false starts. And if that wasn't easy enough, there was also a card in the box with a phone number to call for technical support with installation. Thus, this is a great choice for ordinary folks who want to set up their own home network storage systems, but aren't necessarily network engineers.Still, I did have some issues. I would like to use this system to backup my desktop files automatically. The MyCloud device comes with a free license for the WD SmartWare Pro software. I downloaded the software, installed it, and tried to set up my backup. However, every time I opened the WD SmartWare Pro software, the MyCloud device would appear only momentarily on the home screen, then disappear, leaving DropBox as the only backup option. I fished around through a lot of settings and had no luck getting the backup to work, so I contacted technical support via email. Although their auto-response said they would try to respond within 24 hours, it took 4 days for them to get back to me. Their response said:1) Click on the &#34;Start&#34; menu, and on the search bar please type &#34;Services.msc&#34;.2) Once opened, please look for the following services and insure that their Status is enabled or started and their Startup type is Automatic:Network Connections. Started and automatic.Network List Service. Started and automatic.Network Location Awareness. Started and automatic.Network Store Interface Service. Started and automatic.Server. Started and automatic.SSDP Discovery. Started and automatic.UPnP Device Host. Started and automatic.Workstation. Started and automatic.Once the services are set correctly, please restart your PC and try again.I followed these instructions to the letter. Then I opened WD SmartWare, again, but I still only saw DropBox as a possible backup target. I wrote back to technical support and got an answer after just 4 hours this time, saying to try disabling my firewall and virus protection. That seemed odd. But when I did so and opened WD SmartWare again, it finally showed the MyCloud drive, and it also showed a backup in progress with 500 Gb already copied. At the rate it's going, the backup must have been underway for several days, even though the device didn't show up on the homescreen in WD SmartWare. Thus, it seems there are some software kinks between WD SmartWare and WD MyCloud that haven't been worked out yet. Nevertheless, the system seems to be working now, even with my firewall and virus protection turned back on.Back to the MyCloud device: this is a very powerful system, with a lot of bells and whistles. It is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and Mac OS X Mountain Lion, Lion or Snow Leopard. I haven't had much luck yet connecting my Linux computer to it--hopefully it will be possible, although a Linux connection is not documented by WD. The device does RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, JBOD, and spanning. Its 4 hard drives are hot swappable. If you have experience administering a network, you will find lots of great features like volume encryption with passwords, a network recycle bin, user and group management and quotas, media streaming, P2P download server, Joomla, and many more. Casual home users, on the other hand, may not need all these extras, but they will certainly appreciate the ease of installation of this device for backing up and sharing files on a home network, with the ability to access their files from anywhere.", "Purchased the 16T model.  Arrived setup with RAID5 leaving about 11.8T for raw storage.Out of the box the unit was set up for RAID 5 - my 1st choice.  Can be readily configured for other RAID as well.Older WD models transfer very slowly.  Compared to my Synology DS1813+ it is only slightly slower.  Not as fast as SAN.Loading on nearly 3T from another drive took around 7 to 8 hours.A happy enough choice for a home RAID.", "I have a lot of NAS boxes and I bought this WD EX4 to see what it was about.  It is not very expensive for a 4 Bay solution and it was quick and easy to install.  The small screen on the device gives you all the relevant information you need to type the IP address into a browser and presto- you are connected to the configuration screen.  I quickly set up a 4 disk RAID 5 volume of 2TB disks.  The EX4 took about an hour to configure the RAID volume and longer to format it (I did not time this part but walked away).The EX4 is very easy to use.  The menus are very clear.  You can set up new users and folders that are private or public.  It comes configured with public music/photos folders inside the public share.  A very nice feature that I did not use is its ability to give you &#34;MyCloud&#34; access remotely.The downside of the economic EX4 is that it is a bit underpowered in today's modern NAS world.  I performed some simple tests on transferring 2GB of photo's (about 30meg each).  Here are the results:Write to EX4 -  ------------------- 34.5 MB/sWrite to Synology 1513+ ---- 110 MB/sWrite to Synology DS214 ------ 89 MB/sAs you can see, the transfer rate of 34 MB/sec is respectable but it is easily surpassed by other more powerful NAS boxes.  It may be unfair to compare the EX4 against the Synology 1513+ (which is a bit more industrial) but the DS214 is a 2 Bay box that costs about the same as the EX4 but gives about 2x the write speeds.Personally, I would take a DS214 over the EX4 because of the transfer write speeds.  I hate waiting for my storage to respond and having to do it over a network (I was using a wired network and a 24x1G switch) is always slower than local disk drives.  Most of us who buy a NAS have lots of data and realize that copying 2TB of data from local storage to the NAS can easily take overnight.  Speed is not essential but it makes the NAS much more usable.So, my bottom line is that I would rather use the DS214 and just put the largest disks (4TB today) possible in it than to use the EX4 4 Bay which is slower but might have more storage.  For those of you who would not notice the slower speed of the EX4, then I would highly recommend this EX4 NAS.  It has great software and is easy to set up and use.", "The most puzzling aspect of this NAS is that it has dual ethernet ports that are configurable in several different ways yet it lacks the transfer speed to take advantage of them.  On large file transfers I was topping out at about 40MB/s speeds. On the same network, and a few switch hops away I was getting twice that connecting to a different NAS or a PC.  Performance was ahead of a significantly older NAS device, but not by much.Aside from performance issues, there is a lot to like here.  There are many built in applications and plenty of 3rd party applications as well.  The user interface is polished and easy to navigate.  Connecting a phone or tablet is very simple as well.  Other than the speed concerns I like this device a lot.The bottom line with this device is that it trades an abundance of features for speed.  Possibly its due to the use of a single core CPU.  If so, there isn't much hope for a fix.  Still, if speed is not a priority then this is a great option because of its utility.", "Western Digital hard drives have always been a component of my computers and home storage solutions because of their performance and reliability.  I expected the same out of the WD My Cloud NAS and for the most part it lives up to the WD name.  First, the storage options give you plenty of capacity, no matter your needs.  Second, the additional tools/apps/uses beyond just storage are plenty.You can choose diskless if you want to add your own drives, or do like me and opt for system that is configured with 8, 12, or 16 TB.  These are WD Red drives which are optimized for extended run times.  Consider your initial config carefully as you will get 4 - 2 TB drives with the 8TB unit, meaning upgrading can be more difficult down the road.  I'm not sure about the other sizes, but I would suspect that they may have 4 drives as well.  On the flip side, this can be important for many users depending on your RAID configuration and how you play to use the system.Installation and setup is fairly easy.  The device is about the size of many small servers, but a bit larger than some of the NAS boxes on the market.  Keeping in mind the flexibility and power of this device, there is a lot of power packed into this device.  You have several RAID options to choose from.  The user interface is actually very nice and much better than some of the past WD software I have used on their portable drives.  It's certainly geared for average users with the simple and easy to use UI, but don't let that fool you.  Advanced users have plenty of options and configurations to play with.  I also would consider this device for some small businesses.It can be used as a file server, ftp server, streaming content, or you can use several &#34;apps&#34; like Joomla, phpBB, Wordpress, etc.  I'd like to see a more expanded list of apps, but I'm sure that can be easily expanded with time.  The accessibility from other devices and smartphones is pretty great.  You can easily create users and setup everything you need for a typical setup.  The speed of transfers and most daily usage has been very good.  Under heavy use I've noticed a bit of a lag, such as when streaming, transferring files, and multiple users accessing the system under those heavy load conditions.  But 90% of the time I have not experienced any performance issues.Overall, the WD My Cloud EX4 is a top notch device.  Sure, there might be some little tweaks that could be done to the UI or add some additional capabilities, but the EX4 packs a heck of a punch for home or small business storage.  As long as the device stands the test of time, it'll get plenty of use in my home.", "\"I bought the 16TB version figuring that much storage should last for a while. I need it most for backups; I have/had 5 other USB drives of various sizes to back up video and photo files for a large website.The MyCloud is cheap enough for 16TB and it seems well built. It was fairly easy to set up, but not as straightforward as the reviews would have you believe. There are a lot of options that aren't clearly explained and the WD help site isn't as detailed as I'd like.The second day, it wouldn't connect for some reason, the computer lost the connection to the EX4. I had to reboot and so far, it's been ok. I have it set in the settings to start up at 6 am and turn off at 8 pm.I have mine connected to a Netgear R4500 router bought on Amazon. No problems connecting there, it was as easy as plugging in the included ethernet cable.The problem is that the EX4 is very, very slow. Copying is very slow and sometimes accessing the drive is slower than an old 2400 baud modem, really. I use Microsoft Expression Web 4 to develop web pages, so I use the EX4 as one of the publishing destinations just to back up the website files. To connect to the copy of the website on the EX4 and then publish about 20 changed files takes several minutes, when it should be a matter of seconds.Not sure if the controller or the CPU or the cache memory in the EX4 is to blame, but every time I go to access it, it pauses to sort things out first. Even if I try accessing the drive directly through Windows Explorer, it can take some time before the disks mount and I can access any folders.But the biggest issue is copying and accessing data on the drive through other applications. It's just incredibly slow. Not necessarily a deal-killer for me, since I'm using it only for backups, but I wish it was a lot faster.By the way, I also use it to access the files via a couple of laptops when I'm in a different part of the house. Again, it was easy to set up but very slow whenever I have to access anything on the drive.I'm also hoping it lasts and the controller doesn't fail, as I have read some stories about this with the EX4. I guess the bottom line is that you get what you pay for, I'm wondering if I should have spent more and bought a more highly user rated/reviewed system, but then again, you never know. I was considering the new Lenovo EMC system but it is more expensive and I couldn't find any user reviews or info about them.UPDATE: December 30, the EX4 locked up twice now, not sure why. I discover it when I click on the link in my Windows \"\"Computers\"\" listing for external drives and can't access the EX4, even though the LCD on the EX4 indicates everything is OK.The 4 blue lights right now on the EX4 are on solid, and they are usually blinking. The \"\"WD MyCloud EX4 Dashboard\"\" can't connect either. So I tried holding down the power button on the EX4 and the LCD reads \"\"System is shutting down\"\", but nothing happens. I had to pull the plug on it last time to reboot, now I'll have to do it again. This is worrying -- why would it lock up intermittently? I couldn't find any info in the WD help system on this problem either.\"", "\"Let me break this review into a few parts.HARDWARE:As a programmer and IT guy at our company I was very impressed with the EX4.  First of all it uses WD Red drives which are really one of the most reliable drives on the market, so right away my confidence level is high.Inside this case which is about (8.3\"\"Lx 8.3\"\"H x6\"\" W) is a full blown PC running Linux. This internal computer has its own internal memory for loading applications.It comes in a very sleek nice case with easy access flip down doors for accessing the hot swappable drive bays.  It really is a well though out design.  The model I got is the 8TB version which has four 2tb hard drives installed in it.  The drives come preconfigured in the Raid 5 mode which is probably the best mode for most offices or homes.For those not familiar with Raid 5 setup, it basically gives you 6TB of storage space with redundancy in that any single drive can fail and you will NOT lose any data.  Just replace the Dead drive as soon as you can and the system will rebuild the Raid and your back to having full protection again.The EX4 also offers several other Raid modes from Raid 0 to 11 and ISCSI.  If you want the full 8TB of storage you can use Raid 0 but beware if one drive dies, so does all your data. So I highly recommend you do not use that mode.The EX4 is a fairly quite unit, and very eco friendly.  I measured the current drawn when its idling and it was very low, in the 200ma range.What I really like about the EX4 is the redundant power supply ports and its ability to pool its two Gigabit Ethernet ports for added speed or if you just want to use the second port to connect onto a secondary network you can or you can also add an external network drive that will also work.  The EX4 also has TWO USB 3 ports that allow you to add another external USB drive if you want to add more storage or try more complex Raid setups or they can just be used for a connection to your PC.SOFTWARE:Now this is the part that might be the exciting part for home users, the EX4 has an extensive set of tools available, some built in and many others that you can download from WD and install.  There is even third party App develepment for this drive.It also has software for the iphone and I also believe the Android platform to allow you to use the EX4 as a cloud based backup for all your mobile devices.  This will save you from having to store videos and pictures on your phone; instead you can just upload them via WiFi or 4G to the EX4.The Included software will give you everything you could possibly need and more for diagnosing, configuring and testing the system. After that you have Apps that range from multiple PC backup software to even software that makes the EX4 become an independent Torrent server.  Western Digital has basically created an open platform that allows endless uses for this NAS and it's built in computer.Now keep in mind this drive system is not a speed demon, it's slower than other systems I have used but in some ways it's better than most of the others in that it is much more versatile and user friendly.  I have setup a Synology system and that was not the easiest of tasks, it was a lot harder than setting up an EX4.  In some of the reviews I have read on the EX4 they are talking about speed issues.  Have these people ever setup a large raid system before?  A 8TB Raid network will take a long time to rebuild no matter what model you use, yes it will take a day or more to rebuild the Raid.  IMHO when you setup a raid system it should be for data protection! Speed is nice but what you really want is reliable drives installed in a reliable enclosure system and that's what the EX4 seems to deliver, only time will tell but the drives are very good and the hardware seems to cover all the needed bases.  That is why I did not subtract a star for it being slower than a synology system.With the EX4 I like that all the major diagnostic info is available on the LCD display, I also like the fact that you can do remote backups over the internet, so this could be a very nice off site backup device.The Negatives:I honestly could not find any major faults with the EX4, as I said it's not the fastest of NAS drive systems but it's fast enough to do just about anything you would want it to do.  If I was to nitpick, I could honestly say that the only thing that I did not like was the fact that WD did not include a second power supply in the box.  If you want the redundant power supply system you have to buy a second power supply.CONCLUSION:I am really pleased with the EX4.  It just works well and is designed to be very intuitive and user friendly.  This is the future of NAS in the sense that with more people wanting to make sure their data is safe but not feeling good about using outside cloud storage the EX4 represents a powerful yet easy system to backup and store your precious files and at the same time it offer so much more for those who want to use it for other things with the available apps.\"", "\"Read *all* the reviews.  Told myself that most folks write only when they are unhappy and happy people just get on with their lives.  I have quite a few years of experience with network tech so I figured most glitches were just part of the learning curve and so give products some time and expect a few times of starting over till I found the path that worked.Sorry.  The 16TB unit I got from Frys (same price as Amazon and both charge CA tax so why not support Frys?) simply was not stable enough to trust even for a family unit.Started up, added admin, connected, got latest firmware, rebooted.  Downloaded the desktop software (for Win7 Pro).  Started the dashboard in IE, noticed that the new firmware allows remote Dashboard access (not in any documentation or even in the WD Buglist as being a standing request that had been added - nice).  Changed to Static IP, changed the device name to something short with no spaces but more personal, opened and directed the port forwarding on my router. Added an admin password, relogged in.  Checked Cloud Access and saw it was fine for the admin with the desktop app registered. Added a user, added a private share for them.  Tried to give them Cloud Access and got \"\"User not authorized. (400057)\"\".  Went to Settings tab and sure enough the Device was claiming it was connected for relay but *also* that it thought it was not connected to the internet (Which it was... so it seems that that is a generic error message).  Went back to the Admin Cloud Access settings and now it also said Connection error.  Rebooted.  Relogged in (remotely, so that network connection message seemed very odd)... no cloud access for admn or user, any attempt to change the new user or the admin account settings popped up the error \"\"User not authorized. (400057)\"\" and the actions were ignored.  Searched for that message, got a single foruum page where MyBook users were trying to tell EX4 users that they could use SSH to go into the command line settings... but no MyCloud EX4 answers except to force a factory reset that requires you to redefine all of the user settings from scratch.  Did that. Started over like new ... kept DHCP this time and just added a single new user without a share, instantly got \"\"User not authorized. (400057)\"\" when trying to give cloud access, tried adding a password to the user, got \"\"User Not Authorized\"\" again.. found that I got it now no matter what I tried to do with that user or the admin account.  Did another reset and started over ... didn't change the device name.  Seemed to keep the settings.  Went in and told it to reboot to verify that it would come back happy.. it didn't.  \"\"User not authorized. (400057)\"\" for admin and the single user.Found another forum page that said to press the little reset button on the back (which should be the same as doing a software reset but this person said that it worked better for them), still would have to remove and recreate all user information.  When it came back I started all over again but using Chrome.  Just after adding the new user (no shares, nothing fancy at all), logged out and logged back in and went to give just the admin Cloud Access ... \"\"User not authorized. (400057)\"\" for the both users across the board again.  Tried to delete the new user... could not do it because the box refused with the message that \"\"This web account could not be deleted. Please make sure your device is registered and you do not have any network connectivity issues and try again.\"\"I can and will put up with a lot because I know that usually the fault with new tools is that I just don't understand how to surf them yet and I hit the manuals and go line by line.  But I think that this is one of those times that the unit is just not ready.  I was looking to have the 16TB at home for a few days and once I had a handle on it I would buy a 12TB for my work.  But work is an hour away and I don't feel safe putting this online there and having to drive back and forth to completely rebuild all of the user accounts every time the wind blows.Synology boxes are expensive but feeling confident that a tool will be stable is priceless.\"", "I really like this little device.  Build is first rate with redundant LAN and power connections as well as the best drive mechanism in the class which forgoes caddies while securely locking the drives in place.  You also get a LCD display up front, though honestly I've never used it.  It's all rather quiet, and thus far has offered bullet proof reliability.  My needs have me using this as a storage server, not for real time use.  I've found that I can get 40MB/S writes consistently, which is well below my Synology (8 drive array, so not a fair comparison).  That being said, it's still rather fast, but I wouldn't want to run a database off of it or edit media files stored on it.  Neither really seems to be the intended use.Compared to Synology (I have an 1812+, but others work similarly):Pros* Available with WD Red drives (great drives) or bring your own* Easy drive installation without caddies (best I've seen)* Much faster initial setup* Simpler interface* Redundant power & lan (vs redundant lan only)* Significantly less expensiveCons* Limited extended functionality & apps* Not expandable to additional enclosures* Traditional RAID (0, 1, 10, 5) as opposed to more scalable solutions* No file manager* Much slower (I can use the Synology for my Lightroom files, which I cannot with the WD)note some of these cons can be quite significant for some users and not at all an issue for othersCompared to Seagate Business Storage Windows Server 4-Bay NAS (more of an apples to apples comparison)Pros* Easy drive installation without caddies (best I've seen)* Much faster (and easier) initial setup (Seagate requires a keyboard and monitor)* Simpler interface (Seagate's Windows Storage Server 8 can become quite overwhelming)* Redundant power & lan (vs redundant lan only)* Significantly less expensiveCons* Limited extended functionality & apps* Traditional RAID (0, 1, 10, 5) as opposed to more scalable solutions* No file managerCompared to a two drive array (like the WD My Cloud EX2)Pros* More efficient redundancy of raid 5 (lose 25% of capacity vs 50%)* Faster reads and writes (no scientific testing, but I own and use both)* Redundancy of LAN and power connections* Greater capacityCons* Higher priceI highly recommend that people back up their data and they do so with redundancy (using RAID isn't a backup in itself, but your backup should have redundancy).", "\"The original review is below, but check the update at the end...I've been using and installing several NAS servers lately, so I was excited to see what Western Digital had to offer with their \"\"expert\"\" EX4. I was both impressed and disappointed. It's well made, has a nice user interface but is slower than the competition. If you want more details on how it compares with the entry-levelBuffalo LS420and the professionalSynology DS214please read on.The WD My Cloud EX4 8TB is a substantial piece of hardware. It comes with four 2TBWD NASdrives. I like these and in my prior testing the \"\"NAS specific firmware\"\" seems to make them a bit better in NAS applications than WD Black or even RE series drives. I've used them in Synology and FreeNAS based home-built devices with excellent results.The EX4 unit itself weighs about 12 to 15 lbs with the drives installed. The hardware has a lot of professional features like dual LAN connections and dual power supply inputs. The power supply is external like with a laptop. Construction seems solid and the drives and trays can be replaced without tools. Pretty much standard for this class of device. The back also features 2 USB3 ports for external backup drives or adding USB based media.The case is attractive and has a two-line LCD screen. I'm a sucker for LCD displays on servers. You can cycle through the server name, free space on the server, drive health, and ip address.  I can't say it's been all that useful but I do like it. :-)Be sure not to cover the sides - air flow is important and this was called out in the setup sheet and documentation.When I set it up I was a bit nonplussed by the lack of a setup CD. My first impression was WD was really getting cheap. But I was wrong. The instructions sent me to a setup site where I found excellent setup instructions and a simple setup program. It had me up and going very quickly.I was a bit taken aback by the setup program's EULA which started off in ALL CAPS about \"\"BINDING ARBITRATION\"\". Oy!When the system is initialized it is configured as a RAID5. This means about 6TB usable space. RAID 5 is great for a single drive failure. It's not the fastest option but probably a good tradeoff for folks who want the most space with high integrity. The Buffalo LS420, by comparison comes configured as RAID0 - zero redundancy (what WERE they thinking??) and took hours to reconfigure to RAID1. When I changed the EX4 from RAID5 to RAID10 it was only a few minutes and easy-peasy. Beware that changing RAID like I did erases all data on the drives!!The system appears to have - when initially turned on, to have upgraded it firmware. Maybe it really came with the latest firmware release from June 2014, but that would be a first in my experience. One feature you will not find was removed with the latest firmware: NFS. If you want to do native Linux/Unix sharing, too bad. To take features out of a product isn't usually a good thing, but it probably does not impact a large user population. One feature called out in the new firmware is an improvement in network performance. Given I'm not impressed with this I wonder what it was like before!The web interface is very nice and usable. I found it easy to figure out and setup a new windows file share, add users and groups and manage access. The Synology DS214 interface is a close contender. I can't decide which I like the most.A nice feature of the EX4 is the easy setup of iSCSI targets. A feature not often found on home/soho NAS. This is nice for virtual machines or creating a low-end Storage Area Network (SAN). iSCSI tends to perform much faster than Windows file sharing and that's important if running a virtual machine!The cloud integration is very nice and access can be finely controlled via the GUI. I connected my iPhone to my private EX4 cloud and I was pleased with how well it worked. Excellent!The Buffalo LS420 is distinguished by a lack of a \"\"app ecosystem\"\". The Synology DS214 has dozens of apps in a well developed ecosystem, The WD EX4 is in the middle with several apps like Joomla, Wordpress, a number of streaming solutions and cloud backup to Amazon S3 (why not the more affordable Amazon Glacier storage which is specifically for backup???). There is also a rather old version of phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL databases. It's a start and might be a big plus if it really builds out. With Linux under the hood there should be plenty of opportunity.When accessing the windows shares and mapping drives there was no problem at all. It was again excellent in terms of compatibility and ease of use. I was accessing the device with Windows 7 Pro computers (a laptop and a Dell T7500 dual Xeon workstation). I also used it with a little XP system I am keeping for a specific application. All good.The real test is performance. I compared the EX4 with a Buffalo LS420 2TB NAS and my home-build FreeNAS on a old pizza-box server with a Core-Duo and a couple of WD Red drives. I ran tests copying a 5.5GB folder of updates and some ISO files. So a fair mix of file sizes and I thought a fairly real-world large copy load. I did this on a relatively quiet network.I used 4000 byte Jumbo packets with a switching infrastructure that supports those large frames. I set this in the EX4 settings. FreeNAS and the LS420 did NOT have Jumbo packets enabled. In my testing with Jumbo Packets turned off on the EX4 throughput dropped by about 20%. Being generous, I'm using the EX4 Jumbo Packet enabled measurements for comparison. Both of the computers I used were reading off SSD drives. ASamsung 840 EVOon my Precision laptop and aCrucial M500on my Precision.T7500 workstation. Gigabit Ethernet everywhere.With the RAID5 EX4 I got about 16MB/s write and about 40MB/s reading. I was not very impressed. I then reconfigured the EX4 into RAID10 - a combination of RAID1 and RAID0 for both speed and integrity but at a cost of 50% of the drive space. In RAID10 speed improved to 32MB/s writing and about 65MB/s reading. In RAID 10 iSCSI performance was more like 50MB's writing and about 70MB/s reading.The RAID10 configured EX4 was about the same performance as the low-end Buffalo LS420 in RAID1 (2 drives, the Toshiba's that came with it).  The LS420 has a much more basic web interface which feels kind of 2008. But when it came down to performance it matched the WD EX4 with Windows file sharing. The LS420 does not support iSCSI.My FreeNAS on an old pizza box server ran about 50% faster writing - about 48MB/s and over 100MB/s reading with Windows file sharing. This is compared to the EX4 in RAID 10. The iSCSI performance was closer but FreeNAS was a bit quicker.I don't have the Synology DS214 available for direct testing. It's with a client. It's performance was a bit faster than the FreeNAS when I ran some tests before client install. Noticeable but not dramatic. No Jumbo Packets.Some conclusions:The 4 drive \"\"expert\"\" EX4 from Western digital presents a nice hardware first impression. It's well packaged, easy to setup, has a nice getting started and education web site and resource. the web interface is nicely implemented and intuitive. Cloud functions are trivially easy to setup and use with support for Android and IOS devices (no windows phone - sorry!). It ranks highly on a usability index.With a modest ecosystem of apps it appears to have potential. If WD grows this ecosystem that could be realized with a more complete ecosystem.The last version of firmware for the EX4 (installed) specifically called out performance improvement as a fix. What was performance before the new firmware?There is a lot to like about the WD EX4, but performance is disappointing. I do not know if it might have underpowered computing insides or the implementation just needs some tuning up? With the 8TB model performance can be increased by 50% by switching to RAID10 from the default RAID5 but you'll give up 2TB of usable space!I think for applications where a lot of dependable storage is the goal and performance is secondary - like for backup storage or maybe a media streaming server it's probably a good choice. For home or soho use or casual file sharing/cloud.For low end use the price/performance of theBuffalo LS420is hard to beat for home NAS value with comparable performance. TheDS214is a great platform for more demanding business or advanced home use. FreeNAS is great for those comfortable with self-built/open source.Bottom line: easy to setup and use, nice features rationally implemented. But, less than stellar file serving performance detracts from an otherwise 5 star performance. For this the EX4 gets 4 stars. I hope WD releases some firmware that will get performance more like Synology. Then I'll up this to 5 stars!Hope this helps someone!Update July 11, 2014After living with the EX4 for a little while I wanted to have a folder sync with my DropBox. This is one of the features that's all over the WD EX4 literature - sync with DropBox. When I went to install the well publicized DropBox app it was nowhere to be found in the EX4's app selections. Of course I went to the WD downloads and nope, not there either. Google time... It seems the app has been pulled, perhaps since January 2014. There was a post saying it had been removed for maintenance and would be back soon. Maybe I think.This brings several concerns to mind:1) what happened to those who were using the app when it was pulled?2) sync with public clouds was a plus with the EX4 that is now in question3) with one of the last firmware updates they (as noted above) dropped NFS share support - too bad for Linux users! Is this what to expect with DropBox? I just don't know yet.I don't think this is enough to drop my rating a full start, but I'm curious how WD will handle the DropBox app and how long it will take them to bring it back into service. WD has a skimpy app ecosystem compared to Synology or even the open source FreeNAS. Losing even one popular app will put a big dent into what's available.\"", "I bought this unit recently @ Fry's electronics here in Indy.  I thought it was a little pricey but was OK with it due to the convenience.  I didn't need super high performance, I just wanted something reliable to store a lot of data on.  So, I bought this and 4x 3TB WD red NAS drives.  This formatted to about 8.7TB in a RAID5.  Lots of space, the ability to lose a drive, hot swap.  Should be great.  The best part,  pop the drives in, plug it in and you are off to the races in about 20 minutes.At first all was well.  I moved 3TB of data onto the array.  17MB/sec transfer rate.  That's 136 Mbps for those of you wondering how fast your network needs to be.  In other words,  you'll need a gig switch but barely.  Now these are 6gbps SATA drives in an array that uses striping.  So better than 100mpbs may seem fast but it's way below the potential for this set of drives.  But, whatever, its fast enough to move a bunch of data in a reasonable amount of time.This is where thing went south.  Over the the next 5 days, and during the transfer I find that the web interface to the NAS likes to just freeze up and stop working.  Only fix is to reboot the NAS.  Turns out your transfer rate goes out the window next.  After the initial 17MB/sec rate the best average I saw was 10-11MB/sec and at times it was as bad as 4MB/sec.  I solved the super slow rate by calling tech support to confirm that resetting (different then restoring) will not erase your data.At this point the reason I'm concerned about transfer rate is because I'm now transferring my data off of the NAS so I can return it.  Well, Fry's has a 15 day return policy to get cash back, otherwise it's store credit.  I made the decision to return it on day 9.  This proved to be too late as getting my data back off of the NAS took about 6 days, not to mention a few wasted days trying to figure out why my transfer rate had fell to 4MB/sec.None the less, I returned it and went the freenas.org route.  As it turns out, for $350 you can build a mild PC and just put your hard drives in that and have a rock solid, fast (80MB/sec), open source NAS, that is just bigger and takes a bit of work to assemble.  In other words it will cause your gig NIC to be the bottleneck.  This makes me happy.Having said that, this device (WD Mycloud EX4) is junk.  The only reason I did not give it 1 star is because it did not destroy my data.  It just needed rebooted pretty much any time you wanted to do anything and it had performance that barely warranted a gig Ethernet port on the back, much less the 2 they put on it.If credentials mean anything, I'm a 10 year Senior network engineer.  IT is my livelihood.  I know what I'm doing.  God forbid you are not an IT person and you have to trudge through this POS.  I think the concept is cool, and done right it would be a great, easy to use, minimal knowledge needed, device.  Unfortunately it falls way short.Neat concept, done right it would be very nice.  Maybe in a few years."], "Gamma": [0.03638320416212082, 0.03635379299521446, 0.036382924765348434, 0.03638320416212082, 0.03638320416212082, 0.03638320416212082, 0.03638320416212082,
