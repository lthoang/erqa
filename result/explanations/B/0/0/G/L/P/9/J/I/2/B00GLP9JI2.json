"], "reviews": ["I tend to drink a lot of &#34;flavored water&#34; drinks, and the problem is that they are all quite expensive - usually 1-2 dollars per bottle. It's much, much cheaper to get a refillable water bottle and just use something like this Lipton liquid flavoring bottle. And, I have to say, it tastes just as good.The taste is similar to diet Lipton iced tea, which i like. If you're expecting a full-flavored iced tea taste, then you will be disappointed. But if, like me, you're looking for more of a water flavoring, then this stuff tastes pretty good. I have to admit, though, that I really can't taste the &#34;Tropical Mango&#34;; the tea-flavor comes through more than anything else. Overall, I still like it.", "I love Lipton tea and I love iced tea.  This handy, concentrated, tea is not bad but it's not extraordinary either.A look at the ingredients:HoneyGlycerinWaterMalic AcidBlack tea.minor ingredients.I don't know about you but even if it wasn't posted, I can always taste that synthetic aftertaste of Sucralose.And, it's present here.  It's kind of a silky, almost oily feel that just doesn't go well despite the industry's championing it as a calorie-free substitute for natural sugar.I just don't like it.", "Tea sweetened with honey and flavored with mango sounds great. But sadly, this product did not deliver the tropical treat I was anticipating.This liquid iced tea mix comes in a  squirt bottle that looks suspiciously like a mini mustard bottle. The safety strip was a challenge to remove, causing me to break a nail.  The beverage itself has a pleasing appearance, a pretty reddish amber.  Unfortunately, the flavor was disappointing. It was too sweet for my tastes and had the unpleasant sucralose aftertaste. The mango  was pleasant but the honey and tea were hard to find.Overall I can't say I was taken with the flavor. I prefer my tea to taste like tea and the excessive sweetness was just not for me Pass.", "I enjoy iced tea but sometimes I don't have time to brew a pot of tea. Now I can enjoy my tea anytime and anywhere with just a squeeze of this bottle. The honey and mango flavor shine through and are very tasty. This is a bit more pricey than other similar items but is well worth it.", "It's so easy to prepare this tea. Just squirt a bit into about 8 ounces of water and mix it up or recap your bottle. The amount to use depends on your taste and the amount of water used. I like using a squirt in a 12 ounce glass with about 8 ounces of water in it and adding 2 or 3 ice cubes in the glass. If it needs adjusting, just add water or more tea mix, simple as that. The flavor of the honey, tea and tropical mango is quite good.", "I often purchase drink add-ins to make my water a little more enticing.  These tea and honey drinks are great!  The first one tried was the strawberry, which has been my favorite so far, the cherry was not quite as good, but the mango is right in the ballpark.  A perfect blend of sweet and tea flavors.  More of an adult drink add-in and less with a sugary taste.  I love the honey and tea flavors, so we plan on purchasing more of the mango and strawberry/guava flavors.  Really tasty and gives your waters a little pizzazz!Overall, no complaints here, a good product, good taste and I will be purchasing again. The packaging is also perfect to through in a desk for work.", "This stuff is convenient to use--a nice thing to keep at the office, perhaps, for when plain water just won't cut it. I had to experiment a little to discover the right amount to use. My first few attempts were too sweet. Although the drink tastes fine, it doesn't taste much like mango and it tastes even less like tea. It's more of a sort of generic fruity flavor. Which is fine if that's what you want, but I'd prefer something that tasted more like brewed iced tea.", "\"I've tried a few of Lipton's Tea & Honey to Go drinks and really enjoy the taste.  I fully expected to like the \"\"Iced Tea\"\" ones as well.  They are totally refreshing and, admittedly, much better than the soda I like to drink.  The \"\"to go\"\" packages are all over the place now and if you've been in a convenience store recently, you'll find them right near the water.  You'll also see this type of container up front, usually the Mio water enhancers.  It seems like everyone is getting in on the act, but I do like the on-the-go aspect.  This small bottle is easier to tote around and use than the packets.I can taste the honey and mango when I add a squirt to cold water, but the tea is somewhat glossed over.  Honey granules are a very popular sweetener, but so is Splenda.  In essence the reason these drinks are so sweet is because of the sucralose which is marketed under several names.  If you have problems with this, you can simply take a pass.  All of the information is not hidden, but here on the pictures for everyone to take a look at.Personally, I do love the taste of these \"\"teas,\"\" which taste more like fruit drinks than they do tea.  The real tea drinker in my house actually liked the taste, but does prefer his real tea with his cookies.  If you like the \"\"to go\"\" factor and like your teas ultra-sweet, you may just like these teas.  One additional plus is that these are now Amazon Add-on Items, something that makes ordering them really easy.FEATURES:&#9658;  Made from Real Fruit Flavors & Sweetened with Honey, Squeeze a Little or A Lot & Find Your Perfect Flavor&#9658;  10 Calories per 8 oz Serving&#9658;  10 mg Caffeine per 8 oz Serving&#9658;  Makes Up to 24 Servings&#9658;  For Anytime, Anywhere Use -- Does Not Require Refrigeration&#9658;  Contains 0% JuiceINGREDIENTS:Honey , Glycerin , Water , Malic Acid Provides Tartness , Black Tea Powder , Citric Acid , Caramel Color Contains Sulfites , Sucralose Non-Nutritive Sweetener , Carrot Juice Color , Natural FlavorLIPTON TEA & HONEY ICED TEA MIX:Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids, Summer PeachLipton Tea and Honey Liquids, Tropical MangoLipton Tea and Honey Liquids, Black Cherry DragonfruitLipton Tea and Honey Liquids, Strawberry Guava\"", "\"I've tried several different Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids, and Tropical Mango is my favorite. The other flavors taste good too, but this one tastes the most natural. Just a small squirt in a cold glass of water provides a natural mango and tea flavor combination. I try to use as little as possible just to give my water some flavor. The 2.43 oz bottle lasts me a couple of weeks. I really like Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids, \"\"Tropical Mango\"\", and recommend it.\"", "Makes a flavorful drink from just plain water.  Looks like tea but taste like fruit flavored drink. It has a slightly peachy taste and is refreshing when you do not want plain water.

It's made with real honey, not an artificial sweetener, yet it's only 10 calories per serving. I've always liked the taste of Lipton black teas anyway, so it was pretty much a given that I was going to like the flavor - but the mango flavor is even better than I was expecting! The only problem with this drink mix is how quickly the bottle will run dry.", "I'm a fan of flavored water &#34;enhancers&#34; and was happy to try the mango version from Lipton.Liquid additives seem to work great as you can control the amount of flavoring you add and also correct for different size cups. This is not always possible with the powdered versions.You can really taste the mango in this one, but that covers the tea/honey flavor maybe just a little too much.Compared to mio, it seems to be a little &#34;stronger&#34; of a concentrate as I don't seem to need as much in the same size water. Might just be the flavor though.", "I love Lipton tea and so it was really easy to try these &#8211;- even though I have had terrible results with these small liquid flavors in the past.  It is probably worse if the flavorings have vitamins in them.  These had a nice flavor to them &#8211; both the strawberry and mango flavors, but honestly, they fruit flavors were not like the fruit they were supposed to be and they also didn&#8217;t taste like tea, either.So then I went to the ingredients.  The first and only ingredient I actually tasted was the honey.  That was what gave it the pleasant flavoring.Yes, the flavor is pleasant, but in the way that fruit punch is pleasant.  Nice when you&#8217;re thirsty but hard to describe.", "Food reviews are very subjective, but I really enjoyed the taste of this water additive.  It's a nice combination of tea and honey, with the honey only as a hint in the background; not overpowering at all. I found myself varying the concentration depending on my mood; rather weak if I was quite thirsty and just wanted to guzzle down a glass or two to considerably stronger if I was just going to relax and enjoy a glass of tea while reading.  That's the advantage of a product like this as opposed to buying a pre-mixed bottle or can of tea - each time you use it, it can be a bit different.  Anyway, great container, easy to open and easy to re-secure plus it travels nicely as well.", "I haven't been too impressed by the liquid sweeteners I've tasted in the past, but I really did enjoy &#34;Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids, Tropical Mango&#34;. It has a natural taste to it (unlike others I have tried, which all have left me with an artificial aftertaste), and you get many servings out of this little container. In all, highly recommended.", "Come warm weather, we love Lipton's flavored teas in our house.  And this mango flavor has been a big hit--and is a &#34;keeper&#34;.  Just like the Lipton peach tea, this mango flavor does not overpower the tea taste, it just adds another dimension to your tea drink.The convenience is worth the money:  Everyone can make their own!  It used to be that I was in charge of making up the two-quart bottles of tea and stashing them in the frig, and I did that on average of three-four times a day.  (We are in hot, hot Texas.)  This squirt bottle is especially nice for those of us who like a little &#34;flavor&#34; in our water, as opposed to a potent, dark and rich glass of tea.  This squirt bottle will take you both ways.In the past, we have liked the peach tea flavor the best, and we've augmented with the berry flavors for some variety.  But this year, I wouldn't be surprised if this mango flavor takes over as the go-to flavor.", "I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the taste of this tea. Many powdered instant teas leave me with an aftertaste or just taste artificial, but this was a smooth, pleasant taste that really tickled my tastebuds. However, I was not as enthusiatic about the ingredient list:Honey, Glycerin, Water , Malic Acid (Provides Tartness) , Black Tea Powder , Citric Acid , Caramel Color, Contains Sulfites , Sucralose, Carrot Juice , Natural FlavorAlthough glycerin is generally regarded as safe, it's not my favorite as the 2nd ingredient in anything. Sucralose is not my favorite artificial sweetener, but I prefer it to Nutrasweet. The fact that it is artificially sweetened isn't highlighted on the package and the ingredient list isn't even available on the Amazon website as of this writing, so in spite of superior taste I'm rating it only four stars.", "This is okay tasting but not great tasting either.Kinda sad, since I usually love Lipton products.The sweetness seemed to overpower the mango flavor.Oh well, you can't have a winner all the time.", "I love the taste of this mango tea and honey liquid, but I was fooled by the &#34;natural flavors&#34; listed on the front. Actually, it's sweetened with sucralose (brand name Splenda), an artificial sweetener that contains chlorine. I much prefer sucralose over aspartame (which has a wide range of bad side effects), but I still don't want to use any artificial sweeteners. I drink tea with honey all day long and thought this would be an interesting shortcut.The only other down side is that it squirts out quickly, so it's hard to control how much you put in your drink.Aside from that, it does taste good both hot and cold. I'm keeping it around for occasional use.", "One good squirt into a 16 ounce bottle filled with water does the trick for me (compared, say, to 4 squirts of MIO water enhancer). It's very sweet. I've traveled (by car, foot and bicycle) with Lipton Tea & Honey Liquid containers without mishap. I think anyone who likes sweet iced tea and wants the convenience of a water enhancer type liquid will like this.", "Generally, I'm a fan of Lipton tea products.  When they released their line of Tea & Honey instant drinks, I picked up a couple of different flavors of the To Go Packets Iced Tea Mix.  These dissolved well in water and I was genuinely surprised by how tasty I thought most of them were.  So when I had the opportunity to try out the latest Tea & Honey Liquids, I was happy enough to sample them.First, I'm not a huge supporter of the packaging of these squirt bottles!  Everyone has them these days, and it just seems like such an unnecessary use of plastic product from an environmental standpoint when the upside is the saving of two seconds of stir (or even shake) time. Most of the time, I simply won't buy them on principle.  And they usually cost more too!The Lipton Tea & Honey bottles come in 2.43 ounce sizes which can make up to 24 servings.  The serving suggestion is one squeeze per 8 ounces of water, but it's not an exact science.  You can add more or less to taste.I tried two varieties:Tropical Mango (2 stars):  Strangely, I found this mix to be both too diluted and too sweet.  At one squeeze, I simply tasted sugar water with a mildly fruity flavor.  When I added extra, the flavor did become more pronounced the sweetness was simply overpowering.  I wouldn't add this to my shopping list.Strawberry Guava (4 stars):  I didn't expect to like this one so much!  Here, I did use just one squeeze and the mix was perfect.  It is super flavorful and you can discern both of the fruits and the tea base.  Everyone has different tastes, but I found this quite yummy.  KGHarris, 5/14.", "It is black coming out of the bottle so it definitely contains ground black tea. I couldn&#8217;t taste the tea flavor but the mango is so potent that it dominates. I like this sweet cold alternative to soda. But if I want something as a thirst quencher, iced tea is better (I use little or no sugar).I like the packaging of  concentrate in a small bottle- easy to store. Since I love fresh fruit, this is going to be a summer treat to drink with my meal. I eat ripe mangos when I can get them and this drink definitely has the flavor.", "I couldn't find any details about the ingredients in this product on the Lipton website or Amazon, but when the bottle arrived I saw that it contains sucralose/Splenda. We avoid artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame whenever possible, so I am disappointed in this new product.I mixed a glass of it just to give it a fair review, and it is tasty and convenient. It has a great peachy/mango flavor which compliments the tea flavor. The bottle would fit in a purse or backpack nicely, too.But like Mio, another brand of water flavoring, I won't buy it unless they remove the sucralose.", "Between the absence of either a tea or honey flavor, an unnatural mango fruit flavor (tastes like diluted artificial peach) and an overly sweet sweetener -- sucralose -- that has the added problem of a lingering aftertaste, I found this product to be truly undrinkable.", "I have been using this for weeks and i love the flavor. I am trying to just use it once a day and the other times just drink water, but the flavor is so good and the calories so low it has made it hard. Not too sweet or tannic (bitter from tea), however you can adjust by putting more or less in your water! Lipton definitely has a winner in this one. Great combination flavor!! Plus a little goes a long way!", "I was a fan of the powder packets from Lipton, and this liquid form is very similar. The advantage is that it is easy to squirt however much I want, depending on my mood, with the disadvantage being that it is a bit more bulky. Still, it is a very concentrated fluid and easy to carry.The flavor of this Tropical Mango is pleasant, if a bit nondescript. The tea flavor tastes similar to the powdered Lipton tea that many of us grew up with, including the acidity. The honey flavor, with honey being the first ingredient, comes through surprisingly well. I would prefer if they avoided using the sucralose and food coloring, but I knew what I was getting into.Overall, this is a nice way to quickly inject tea flavor into water..", "I am always looking for ways to cut calories since I have weight to lose. This Lipton tea is a great way to have a nice refreshing drink without all the calories of a soda. It has really helped me to rehydrate after a tough workout.I've tried a couple of the flavors and all of them are good. This one is nice and fruity and light and I highly recommend it.", "\"Making tea has never required heavy lifting. I mean, water, tea, cup and there it is. But it gets tricky if you want it cold. Do you make hot tea and then sit there whistling for hours and hours while it cools? Make sun tea and get old waiting for that too happen?  Make it with those little crystals that taste good not like real iced tea? If you've been asking yourself this question over and over again, you need to find more to do with your life. I'm just saying. Any way, back to the tea.Lipton came out with some drops that are very tasty. The Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids Tropical Mango Flavor is delicious. I just guzzled down 32 ounces while watching \"\"The Rake\"\" on Hulu.  Good show, good drink. I added a big squeeze of lemon to cut some of the sweetness and it went from good to WOW.I know drinking water is good, but I get bored with the stuff.  This makes downing those 8 or so glasses per day very easy. In fact, it's so drinkable, I find myself gulping down an entire glass. Too good to sip. It reminds me of getting a glass of chocolate milk when I was a kid and glugging the whole thing.I did not look at the ingredients. They are on the bottle, but the print is tiny. And sometimes it's just better for me not to know. It may be full of horrible things, but what the heck, life is short and I'm probably doomed anyway and not because I'm going to have an occasional glass or two of Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids. It's too late to fix things now, I might as well enjoy.A great thirst quencher. It's good hot, and even better cold. The container is tiny so you can leave it in your desk at work, carry it in your purse....and instead of paying $3 for an iced tea when you order lunch, get some free water and give it a quick skwoosh.  Five stars.\"", "I'm always looking for ways to drink more water.  I try to consume 100 oz per day, but sometimes that can get a little tedious.  I've done partial juice and water, or adding something like Propel or Gatoraide to water, but I don't want all those extra vitamins, electrolytes, etc. that energy drinks come with.  This is a perfect solution.  All natural ingredients, easy to use (just a small squirt in a 24 oz container is plenty) and it adds a wonderfully lemony/mango flavor to my water.  The taste is wonderful, and no aftertaste.  I'm hooked on these and will be definitely using in the future.", "My two children and husband love these water enhancing-type drinks, but we've discovered that many of them leave a horrid after taste in your mouth. The Lipton Tea and Honey, however, didn't! While my husband and kids agree that it's not their favorite enhancer, they also agree that they can definitely drink it and that, if you like mango flavor, you'll enjoy this.", "The flavor of this is good, though somewhat artificial. I really wish it was not made with splenda (sucralose), since I avoid artificial sweeteners. I'd for it to have a few more calories and the addition of more honey or cane juice. Even though it says it is flavored with &#34;real fruit flavors&#34; it also says it contains no juice.", "This has a pretty good taste and is very convenient. I used it mainly to add a little flavor to my water at the gym. It fits easily into my bag and, really, there's no need to measure. Give it a healthy squirt and you're good to go. Of course, I would caution anyone to not come to this expecting the flavor of real brewed tea, but if you look at it for what it is--a sweet convenience product--it's not bad at all."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.033824335783720016, 0.033827461302280426, 0.023190097883343697, 0.02870442532002926, 0.03421425074338913, 0.03342122957110405, 0.030779102817177773, 0.02694571204483509, 0.025405224412679672, 0.03396955505013466, 0.03292729705572128, 0.032748449593782425, 0.035052958875894547, 0.03363874554634094, 0.033864568918943405, 0.031447816640138626, 0.030348919332027435, 0.032848525792360306, 0.03303910791873932, 0.0297415591776371, 0.029174670577049255, 0.03585745766758919, 0.030767900869250298, 0.029933873564004898, 0.0321202278137207, 0.030409321188926697, 0.03051205351948738, 0.02678571082651615, 0.029567720368504524, 0.03118244931101799, 0.031482845544815063, 0.03226647153496742]]}
