"], "reviews": ["This was immediately heavier than my other Conair hair dryer even when I lifted the package.  I thought oh no, this is way too heavy for me.I almost put off trying this out due to the extra heft this has over my other beloved Conair dryer.  But I'm glad I didn't.This gave me the best at home blow-out I've ever had.  It dried my hair super fast without having to bake it.  I have frizzy wavy hair but all frizz is gone even without conditioner after using this.  It is silky straight and dried in incredibly fast time, without feeling like it was beating and heating my hair to death.My hair is so straight after a quick dry with this, it almost looks like I ironed it.  And I didn't even condition it.I'm hooked on this heavy dryer.  It dries so fast and so well, I don't have time to get tired of holding it.  I never knew the right dryer could make such a difference.This comes with three huge rollers, three matching yellow clips, and a giant blow out brush.  If you have thick curly or wavy frizzy hair you need to have this dryer.This will tame it down in record time.  It has some kind of special technology.  This is serious business.  The ceramic technology is very gentle to my hair.  The ionic technology has gotten rid of every bit of frizz, something I would never have believed possible, especially with no conditioner on it.  These aren't just gimmicky words. The results are the proof it works.Honestly, if someone had told me that the right dryer would do this for my hair I wouldn't have believed them.  Now I know how my stylist gets my hair so sleek and smooth and frizz free.  She is going to be seeing a lot less of me now that I can make my hair look as good as she does.Do I recommend this hair dryer?  You bet I do.  This dryer is one of my rare ten star products.  Fabulous.", "The surprise for me in using this hair dryer is how it can straighten hair.  This type of hair dryer is probably what professional hair stylists use for that purpose.  According to the instruction manual that came with it, this dryer produces some infrared heat along with negative ions that reduce frizz by up to 75% when compared to DC motor natural ion hair dryers.It's the first time I used this type of hair dryer, so it really confirmed to me that I never had a good hair dryer before.  It's also large compared to what I've used before.", "I currently own another blow dryer, a different brand, also rated at 1875 watts.  This one is slightly quieter and smaller, but weighs about the same.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this dryer than the other one. Though this generates ample air flow and heat, the nozzle is significantly smaller than the other dryer.  I believe that's why it takes longer to dry my hair.This comes with a functional concentrator that is easy to attach and remove.  It does not, however, come with a diffuser, which means it will be of little use to some.Three velcro rollers and clips are included.  The rollers are large in diameter, but short in width.  I could not get all of my hair, which brushes my shoulders, wrapped around them.  I could have, if they were wider.  Because the rollers are so large in diameter, they can't be used at all unless one's hair falls well below the chin.  Furthermore, velcro is meant to attach objects.  Those little tiny fish hooks grabbed onto my hair, and I had an awful time removing the rollers.  By the time I managed it, the curl I'd achieved was beyond repair.  I don't recommend velcro in your hair.  It can cause damage.Also included is a round, plastic, extruded brush with a metal barrel.  Though mine arrived with a number of the bristles bent, I can still get it through my hair.  I found the brush very useful, and if I found it sold separately, I would buy it.  The bristles do not have those little knobs on them.  I like that, because those little knobs can catch hair.  The ends of the bristles are not perfectly smooth, and can scratch the scalp.  I found that holding the brush just a hair away from the scalp, I can get some volume.  No curl, but my hair is straight and fine.  For longer hair, this is a very good blow styling brush.  It is not appropriate for short hair.In summary, this blow dryer is quite adequate if you don't need a diffuser and don't plan to use the rollers, but it is not spectacular.", "I'm always eager to try a new hair dryer as I have very long wavy hair and it's a chore to blow out. Unfortunately, this isn't quite THE one for me.PROS?- Very powerful stream of air.- The hot is HOT. If you leave it too long in one spot you will definitely feel it on your scalp.- The concentrator is movable in full 360 degree rotation (the current one I have is not).- The cool burst is in a good spot and when you add the basic cool air stream, you get a nicely cool flow of air.CONS?- The toggle buttons switch off too easily. I accidentally turned mine off, to warm, to cool, etc., probably 15 times while I was drying my hair. Completely annoying and almost a complete deal breaker for me--overriding most of the Pros.- The included brush is horrible. It looks like it will be good, but within the first five minutes I had thrown it aside and was using my own brush. The plastic is too hard--I'd much rather the forgiving nature of a bristle + plastic brush--I felt like this brush pulled out a lot of hair.- It's a bit on the heavy side. I could feel it after the first five minutes.MEH THINGS?If this is called a Blow-Out Essentials version, I'd much rather a butterfly-style claw clip was included instead of a simple clip, as that clip won't hold much of my hair.OVERALL?It's three-star okay. I don't love it and I don't hate it but it just isn't really for me.", "\"First off, I have to admit that I have *not* actually tried this for it's marketed purpose.  I'm consistently letting my hair curl at them moment, and didn't want to harass my delicate curls just for the purpose of reviewing this.  However, it has been tested with a diffuser on curls and with the concentrator on straight hair.More about that in a moment, first I have to throw in that this dryer *does NOT include a diffuser.*  Normally, that would have cost it a star with me, but since it's specifically marketed for \"\"Blow-Outs,\"\" it would not be fair to mark it down for that.  However, if you are in the market for a straightening sort of dryer, it is possible you have some curl, and if you have some curl, perhaps you want to know, WHAT SIZE DIFFUSER will fit this.  So, I measured the dryer opening.  Outer edge to outer edge, the circumference is 1 7/8 inches; inner edge to inner edge the circumference is 1 3/4 inches.  I found that one of my existing diffusers, the one form my Remington Pearl dryer (which, ironically does not fit my other Infiniti dryer, but fits this one well).Overall, (though I prefer airdrying, which is rarely practical), I am very pleased with this dryer!!  It has performed well for me.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a really nice range of temperatures.  Sometimes the \"\"medium\"\" temperature on a dryer is quite indistinguishable from low or high, or the cool shot isn't cool at all.  This dryer offers a full, distinct range of temperature high-to-low, and the cool blast is truly cool.  Also, I've been successful in holding the cool-shot button down for long periods of time---and it actually stays cool.  Very nice.My mother borrowed this to blow dry her stick-straight, rather thin hair.  She was surprised by how much she preferred it to her older dryer.  Really nice concentrator on this thing, very efficient air distribution.  She was pleased with the results.Bonus items:  The Velcro rollers are not bad quality.  Five might have been a better number.  I've really enjoyed the clips for clipping up my roots for root lift!  They are the perfect size.  The brush feels a little cheap, but the inner metal rim does help with the blow out process.  All-in-all, I think this is a good package of items to get one into a good technique for blow outs!It's also nicely survived some rough handling.Small flaws:It did not eliminate frizz.Initially, I did not like the loud colors but they've grown on me.  I would probably still prefer another color, but these are fun.  And the yellow does make it easy to find!I do wish it was slightly more ergonomically designed and had better weight distribution.  I think they may have engineered this for a man's hands or perhaps just a larger woman's hand.  It feels slightly heavy and unwieldy with prolonged use (and my hair takes a prolonged amount of hair to dry).  My mother also remarked on the weight.\"", "It's a hairdryer . . . in a color that hurts the eyes . . . with rollers and sectioning clips that do the same.What dries my hair faster is the attachment, which comes with many other brands of hairdryers, just not in purple. I have another 1875 Watt hairdryer that has a less tapered front end, so this one is a tad more forceful. The included brush works as well as any other round brush I own.There are two speed settings and three heat settings, and the cold shot is quick - I'll give it that much. No waiting for the cold air to come. It's hard to use, though, because it's a big hairdryer and pulling the trigger with my hand that far away from my head at that angle is awkward.My hair is smooth afterwards, just as smooth as it is after using my other two ceramic hair dryers. It seems ceramic is all we can get nowadays.It's a good hairdryer as far as hairdryers go, just overhyped and hurts the eyes.", "In a household with three women, we have used a wide range of hair dryers in the price range of $19.99 through $150.  All my girls were surprised by the power as was I.  I was especially surpised by the build quality, not expecting it in this price range.The product is packaged very well and not difficult to remove.  The Infiniti does not come with a diffuser.  It arrives with a concentrator, some hair clips, a pretty decent quality brush, and some inexpensive rollers you will likely not use.  The concentrator is easy to put on and remove. The design of the Infiniti is pretty good.  All the girls found it easy to hold and use though the rocker switch was depressed accidentally a number of times until they got used to it.  There is a loop at the handle base to hang the Infinit when not in use, a nice feature.  Infiniti provides two speed settings, three heat settings, and a very quick cold shot.  The build quality feels solid, not cheap in any way, which makes it a little on heavy side for our seven year old to use by herself.The unit operates flawlessley at 1875 watts.  However, it is not too loud even when compared to the Elchim at more than double the price (2000 watt however) and slightly less airflow in my opinion when compared side by side. Our girls have a combination of short curly hair and long straight hair.  This dryer blew the curly hair straight in no time and reduced friss significantly (eliminated it with our daughter who has natural straight hair).  In my opinion, the ionic claim is true.Bottom line, it is a great hair dryer in this price range, if not among the best.", "Update: After using this dryer for a few months, it has already broken. It was never dropped or damaged in any way but one day it just started whistling very, very loudly. I was afraid it was going to shoot flames at me! I have had a great experience with my other Conair dryers and this was very disappointing. 2 Thumbs down.Original review:I have been using an ionic Conair Infiniti for a few years now. It is still running great. This new version of the Infiniti addressed some of the complaints I had with the older version and for that, I like it much more. The buttons are easier to switch on/off and to change settings. (the old one I had to dig my fingernail in to slide over because they were flat buttons) The new version is lighter weight, and feels more comfortable in my hand. It is also not as loud. This kit comes with a very nice blow out brush, 3 rollers and 3 sectioning pins. I have no use for the rollers and pins but my teenage daughter uses them daily. The ionic technology is important for drying my hair quickly and without added frizz. The former Infiniti was a good dryer and has lasted me for many years, but I have switched to this one and like it more for the improvements.", "I have traditionally used less expensive hair dryers, though once I discovered the joy of dryers like this one, I'll never go back. My hair is dry in about a minute - fully dry, even the back (which is about 2 inches past my shoulders) that is left wet with other dryers.The dryer comes with a concentrator which is easy to put on, hair separator clips, three rollers, and a hairbrush.  The nozzle on this dryer is already narrow and thus you get very focused air.PROS- Dries SUPER fast- Comes with some nice additional items- Noticeably reduces frizz- Lightweight for a full size dryer (1875 watts)- Fun colors- Fast cold shotCONS- No diffuser (I don't use one)- A little too easy to hit the rocker switches and change your settingsVery happy with this!", "This is a powerful and fairly lightweight hair dryer. The hot blows very hot, and it has a cool button to blow cold air. It comes with a nice set of accessories. Clips, brush, velcro rollers large round vent brush.Works nicely and fits comfortably in your hand. A good hair dryer."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06514885276556015, 0.11368554085493088, 0.07601483911275864, 0.10484789311885834, 0.10622988641262054, 0.1156487688422203, 0.12145067751407623, 0.06550073623657227, 0.11686323583126068, 0.11460956186056137]]}
