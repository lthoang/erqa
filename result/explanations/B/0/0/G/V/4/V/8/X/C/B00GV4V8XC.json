I am only a couple of hours into this game, and already it blew my mind, the first AR movie looks good both in standard and in 3d, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the story thus far is amazing.  It takes a lot of the elements from the old style RPGs but adds a twist - a risk/reward combat system which allows you to choose early combat, or save up brave points by defending and then going whole hog on an enemy (its fun to take out an enemy of you store up enough points in one shot) or using a special ability to Speed up your turn, but to do this you either need to use money to buy potions, or let your system sleep for 8 hours, the job system reminds me of the Final fantasy tactics games where you can level up the current jobs, or switch out and gain levels learning new things, and making each character unique.  Also the streetpass and friend list comes into effect, you can use powers and abilities others have by passing them while your system is in sleep mode and also use them to rebuild your town, a good benefit for those like me who enjoy extra things to do.  The soundtrack is reminecent of old FF games, haunting and beautiful.  Overall I say this game deserves a place in any players library and while the story may be linear, the ways to get there are immense.  Enjoy.UPDATE(WITH LITTLE SPOILER) - for those who have not beaten it, or beat it without trying, I only am in chapter 5 - but I discovered there is an alternate ending.  When you do the Rite after Airy says stop keep pressing the x button and keep going until the crystal shatters - you will unlock another story when beaten will get you an outfit for Anges, but then you will go back to before you shatter the crystal (usually suggested to do the final Crystal), there will be changes to the story and to the opening screen shot.  Enjoy", "\"I've been playing role playing games since Final Fantasy 1 was new, so I thought I'd give this game a go given the comparisons to the classics. Unfortunately, Bravely Default falls completely flat with its characters and story, and the battle system is nothing special.The game has a class system that is incredibly similar to the also overrated Final Fantasy V: you can choose to be any class you want on any character, and mix the skill sets from any two classes at a time. This gives the game a lot of strategy on the surface, but just like FFV, the class balance is terrible at times. Some classes have insanely overpowered skills, while others will have you wondering why they even exist at all. Take the merchant, for one. This class will help you earn more money, but its skills cost money to use. Why would you want to give up stats to take a class whose only benefit (more money) is counteracted by the fact that you need to spend all your money to get the benefit of his skills? It's just a class that you'd level up for the sake of having its passive skills, and then dumping for a \"\"real\"\" class. That's always the issue to me with games that have a class system. Why are so many classes not viable? Every class should be a legitimately good choice for a main specialization that you'll use through the game. That's simply not the case here. It does not feel like much effort was put into making every class a genuine contender. It's obvious that some classes merely exist because, well, why not? Might as well throw more into the game to give the illusion of choice, right?The battle system has a gimmick that is being touted as refreshing and unique and strategic. I'm not impressed with it. What it comes down to is that you have some control over when your characters take their turn. You can take a lot of turns all at once, but you will wait that many turns after to act again. It's not a new concept in a turn-based RPG to have some ability to control when your characters act in battle. With Bravely Default, you have so much control that it almost becomes a fault in the game. For example, obviously in almost any non-boss battle all you're going to do is use all your turns right away to kill everything in round 1, or kill as much as possible before the AI has a chance to act. For most of the game you can just put it on auto battle with that as your setting, and you'll be fine. The only time you need to change it up is on bosses where you might need to defend from a special attack on a given turn, or save turns on your healer so you can heal the right people when needed.All that being said, the above complaints are not meant to say that this is a bad game, just that it's not nearly as original or well designed as I would have hoped. It has high production values, good presentation, good sound, and a lot of great options. Overall it's definitely a competent RPG, and gives fans of old-school RPGs another game to mess around with using a formula that a lot of people still like.If the review ended here, I'd be giving the game at least 4 stars, but I have one more complaint that really bothers me enough that I considered dropping the score even more than I did: The characters and story in this game are really awful. I absolutely can't stand the narrative or the script. One of your main characters spends the entire game just making lewd comments about women, even as the other party members tell him to stop. He's not even the only one - there are at least two other instances where characters were portrayed as being extremely rude towards women. I realize this is supposed to be a joke, but in life, a joke stops being funny when it's making those around you uncomfortable. It's not that I'm offended or have no sense of humor. It's that I want a character to be more than just a series of pick up lines and rude commentary. The character is one-dimensional. Being lustful isn't just one aspect to him, it's virtually the only aspect. The fact that he ignores the pleas of the women to stop makes it uncomfortable.In the end, if you loved Final Fantasy V and games like it, you might love this game if you can ignore the terrible story and characters. You might even be not quite as annoyed as I was - I'm guessing most people weren't. Still, I thought it would be helpful to lend another voice to the large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews, because the game absolutely has flaws and is not for everyone.\"", "\"Bravely Default is a turn-based RPG about four Warriors of Light doing something with crystals to save the world, but half the calories of your average Final Fantasy game. ... I just wanted to say that. Sorry. :P Even so, if you like old school Final Fantasy, you really need to play this game.There are two really good features in this game. Firstly, there's the game's eponymous battle system. As opposed to picking a single series of attacks like you would in old school Final Fantasy, can pick up to four attacks on a given turn. However, picking more attacks than you have leaves you vulnerable for as many turns. Suppose you're fighting your standard field monster. In that situation, you'd probably want to 'Brave' and launch four repeated attacks to kill it quickly. However, if you're fighting a boss, you may want to be more judicious with how you use your turns.Second, there's Job system. It's a lot like Final Fantasy Tactics, if you've played that game. What I mean by that is that there are a variety of different jobs that you can give to any character you want to. It's different from FFT in that you gain access to new jobs by performing optional subquests. Once your character is in a new job, you get Job Points from winning battles. The Job Points go toward increasing your Job Level, which gives you access to more attacks and abilities. Your characters can also have a \"\"Second Job,\"\" which basically gives them a second set of special attacks. There are many different jobs, most of which are staples of the Final Fantasy series such as Knight, Black Mage, White Mage, Summoner, Time Mage, etc. There are also a couple which are unique to this game (as far as I know).As far as the story goes, it basically what I said in the first sentence of this review. The four Crystals which appear to maintain the balance of nature in the world of Luxendarc have gone out of balance. You and your party need to go around fighting monsters to get them back into the balance. There's a bit more to it than that, but I won't spoil the plot for you. It's worth mentioning that there is a HUGE amount of detail about the world of Luxendarc in this game. It's far more than I ever expected to see in a handheld game. One of the characters keeps a journal about the events that are going on in the game people the meet, and it'll tell you more than you ever wanted to know about the world of Luxendarc. Also, the events that culminated in the plot of the game and the characters involved with it become more and more fleshed out by doing the optional subquests. Story and lore-wise, Bravely Default is very impressive.I should warn you that, if you want to do all of the subquests and get the true ending, the game can be very long. You'll be performing some of the same tasks over and over again. You might think of this as shameless filler and a bore. I thought of it as an exciting opportunity to level up some more! I had a great time experimenting with the many different Jobs and abilities in this game, and the fact that I had to fight some of these enemies repeatedly gave me a chance to master a wide variety of Jobs and get new abilities for my characters. It's understandable that some people would dislike the second half, but if you enjoy the underlying RPG mechanics, it probably won't bother you too too much. Also, some of the best parts of the game come in the second half's subquests. Those battles are as intense any Final Fantasy fight I've ever seen, and the game expects your party to be completely trained and ready for anything. The enemies will rain down 9999 damage on your two or three times in a row if you're unprepared. (This is not to say that I didn't think, \"\"Geez... again!?\"\" several times in this part of the game.)Some of the music in is this game simply fantastic. My favorite track by plays when you visit a certain snowy village. However, everything's really good. You may well hear the boss theme two hundred times throughout the course of the game, but it doesn't lose much of its catchy-ness at game's end.If I had to find fault with the game, it's simply in the way that the characters will repeat themselves when they encounter the same situation twelve times in a row. They do sometimes say different things, but not as often as they should. After you hear the same lines said so many times, you might yourself thinking, \"\"Thanks Agnes, but your Crystal is in another castle!\"\"Even though I think very highly of it (I did just rate it five stars!), I would only recommend Bravely Default to people who like turn based RPGs. The second half the game is redeemed largely by its 'grinding' elements. If you're uncertain as to whether you like these sorts of games, Final Fantasy IV for SNES or maybe VII, VIII, or IX for PSX would be fine places to start.\"", "\"Part of the reason I love turn based games is because my reflexes stink. I can play well up to a certain level in many fighting games, but often have to get someone to beat the game for me when it comes to the final boss, as is usually the case with the 3DS Zelda game that came out recently. What I'm happy to say is that Bravely Default has three settings, one of which is easy- so easy that you could probably set a very inexperienced gamer on this and they'd be able to complete this with little problem.The story of this game is rather nice, but I'll admit that it's not sitting at the top of my \"\"best storyline ever\"\" list. It's high up there, partially because the voice acting is rather nice, but those spots tend to be held by the first two Golden Sun games and the Zelda games. Still, it's pretty fun and I can find myself getting rather drawn up into the suspense. I've cheated a little and looked up the game's final story so I knew one of the big twists early on. However looking the story up also freed me up to find some of the little details people have pointed out that I would have otherwise missed, such as Airy's wings supposedly changing depending on which world you're in. It's the little details like this that really impressed me.Game play is nice, although I'll warn you that if you're going to play on easy and want to be the type of completionist that maxes out each job, that's going to take a pretty long time. I haven't played on the more difficult levels yet, but I imagine that it'd take a fairly long time regardless of which level you're playing at. It's not a necessity to do this, but it does pay off if you max out all of the jobs and move into freelancer mode, where you get a boost for each mastered job. Controls are fairly easy to learn and navigate, although it did take me a little while to get my bearings in all of the sub menus.Now as far as the infamous sleep points go... I will say that I hate that they exist because I dislike the idea of these types of microtransactions in a game people have already paid for. I have no problem with buying extra levels ala Fire Emblem, as they expand the gameplay. These? They do nothing except give you an extra attack. They're handy, but not necessary to really beat or win the game. You can collect them for each 8 hours of time that you leave the game running on your DS in sleep mode. You'll probably want to do this often, as you'll have to leave the game running to get the Norende shops built. They won't build if your game isn't running, which I view as a pretty irritating aspect. This means that you either have to tag a lot of people who have played the game or the demo (it's been slow going for me) and try to level the shops up as quickly as possible or you have to turn the game off and have it take a lot longer to level up the shops. Upgrading the village isn't necessary, but it does give you a lot of bonuses. It's just a little irritating in what's otherwise a fairly good game.Overall I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based RPGs or Final Fantasy in general. (Oh yes, this is a FF game, although it doesn't outright state that it is.) An extra bonus is that the game comes subtitled in various different languages, which will undoubtedly be fairly handy for all of our non-Japanese or English speaking fellow gamers.UPDATE:I'm almost finished with the game and I have to say that my overall opinion is the same. I do think that the game is fun, but the issues with this are still pretty clear. I grinded pretty hard and managed to level up all of my characters' jobs, but I'll be honest in that at times it wasn't very fun. A good way around this is to level up Norende as quickly as possible and buy one of the accessories that allows you to get double EXP and JP- but at the expense of gaining any money. Of course there's an accessory that will allow you to do the opposite. Pairing them together will not give you anything, unfortunately.\"", "If you like JRPG's and you like turn based classic combat with some great updates this game is for you. Jobs, classes, order, strategy. Be brave or charge up, act now or hold. This game has great game play. The story itself is not all that amazing, and the characters are pretty standard fare. As games go though this one is fantastic overall, I wish this came out on a large home console, even if it were say the Wii-u. Skip FF13 all of them and get this instead.", "You all knew this was coming, buckle in too... it's gonna be a wild ride.Bravely Default, as many of you know, is Square-Enix's latest RPG. I like to think of it as Square holding this game out in front of you going &#34;Hey, look LOOK We can still make RPGs... no no don't look at FFXIII look at this.&#34; This is of course not true, but it's funny in my head. The game is Final Fantasy down to every last drop, the only thing it's missing is Chocobos, Mogs, and the words &#34;Final Fantasy&#34; in it's title. Let's go through the FF Checklist shall we?1. Party of characters that have no business having the power of gods because they are like... 17. Check2. Hair styles that require at least 1 gallon of hair gel a day? Check3. Classes and Spells that only Square uses (Fira, Blizzaga, etc...). Check4. Final Fantasy Items: Hi-Potions, X-Potions, Ethers, Turbo Ethers, Antarctic wind etc... Check5. &#34;Multi-hits&#34; (when you attack it says 4-hit) Check6. &#34;Limit Breaks&#34; of some kind? Check7. Airships? Duh! Check8. Final Fantasy jobs? Let's see... Black Mage, White mage, Red mage, Monk, Ranger, Summoner... CHECK8. Four Elemental Crystals that serve as the centerpiece for the world making it run in harmony until one day something shadowy and/or evil happens to them that requires a party of unlikely heroes to band together and make the crystals shiny again... CHEEEEEEEEEECK.Ok now that we've established that this is Final Fantasy V-2 (May as well be). ON WITH THE REVIEW.I'm going to say this right out of the gate. If you have any desire and I mean ANY slight liking of turn based JRPGs, and you have a 3DS. Get this game. Now. If you don't have a 3DS, go buy one and get this game. The amount of things in this game is astonishing and it's just a blast to play, while at the same time it feels like a mixture of modern and older mechanics... weighted more to the older side. I'm going to section out this review so if you are interested in the story or combat you can skip to those sections. Not what I USUALLY do but I'm feeling different today. I have not finished the game but I am at the end of chapter 2. That may not seem like far but that's like... 20 hours already. I've had enough time to get a grasp on the games existence!StoryI can't rate a story until I've finished it, and even then it's not really a ratable thing. However, I can say that it's at least so far interesting. The following is not a spoiler, unless you count what you learn in the first like... 20 minutes a spoiler. The world is held together by 4 Elemental Crystals, Water, Fire, Wind, and earth. Each crystal has a vestal that keep the crystal all shiny and happy through prayer (It's the games religion. Crystalites or something I believe it was called). One of your 4 party members is the Vestal of wind, Agn&egrave;s (pronounced on-yes... not kidding). In the opening video we see bad things happening, some sort of shadow has taken over the crystals. Gee... haven't heard THAT one before... Meanwhile Tiz's entire village is reduced to a giant hole. The goal, as far as I can tell, is to go around the world and restore the 4 crystals. *Ahem* Totally not FF1 or FFV.While you are on this task, another major power called the Bloodrose Legion (I believe) is trying to stop you, since they are anti-crystals and think that the world should be better off without them, yet the second the crystals stopped working the world... more or less died so I'm not sure what logic they are using. Either way the story does what it needs to do, it provides a way to get from Point A to Point B and it actually does something I approve of, it doesn't get in the bloody way. Not once since this started has there been a GIANT gap of story, and by that I mean you finish a task and you spend the next 2 hours listening to people talking about this and that. The talking scenes are quick, they get to the point for the most part, and don't get boring. Just goes to show Square can still tell a story without it being 8 feature length films. With some gameplay in between.CharactersAgain, can't really rate this one. The four main characters all have a distinct personality.Tiz, the cliche hero... I mean Shy Farmer, witnessed a terrible cliche... I mean his village being destroyed, and joined up with the Vestal of wind in the hopes of restoring his village. He is a quite type that is willing to protect his friends yadda yadda yadda. Walking. Talking. Cliche.Agn&egrave;s, or as I like to say dear god please stop talking now my EARS ARE BLEEDING (more on that later). She is the Vestal of Wind and has been tasked with fixing the worlds problems, despite everyone hating her in nearly every town I seem to go to. Then they like her once Agn&egrave;s and the gang fixes something. Silly non-believers. She is innocent, having spent her entire life away from the common-folk and doesn't know a darn thing about what goes on in the world.Ringabel, the games other male character. He has, and stop me if you have heard this one before, Amnesia! he can't remember anything, but he does have a journal that seems to be detail everything that happens before it happens and serves as a plot device constantly. He is also a self-proclaimed ladies man and hits on pretty much every female in the area around him. He has some great lines though even if most of the time you want to kick him in the back of the head.Edea, Actually I saved the best for last as she is by far my favorite character in this game. She betrayed the army she was with to protect Agn&egrave;s and has probably got some of the best bits of dialog in the game, particularly when talking to Ringabel who has fallen in love with Edea.So there you have it, 2 walking Cliches and 2 characters that have a bit of spirit to them. They work well and have a nice synergy about them. I enjoy their interactions from Agn&egrave;s's cluelessness to Ringabels... idiocy and Eda calling Ringabel out on it.By far my favorite line in the game thus far has been:Ringabel: &#34;I know, I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure it out.&#34;Edea: &#34;Oh? Perhaps you aren't hitting the wall hard enough, here let me assist you&#34;Dunno why, but it makes me laugh!Voice Acting - 2/10OK... so I've described the main characters and they are fine and all but I'm going to touch on what I believe to be the most painful part of this game... it's voice acting. I don't say this lightly, but it is among the worst voice acting I have ever heard in a video game to date. There are worse examples in other games (Maro maro from Blue Dragon for example) but, on the whole this entire game's VAing is bad. I even rate Star Ocean 4's voice acting above this and THAT is saying something.Agn&egrave;s has got by far the worst voice, it's grating, annoying, breaks constantly and just is all around unpleasant. Couple that with the fact that the sound quality of the game is so compressed it's just sad and you have an unpleasent experience. Ringabel and Edea actually have decent voices at least, they have emotion, and sound higher quality for some reason. Those Actors were trying. Some of the enemies also have decent voices, while others have ungodly terrible voices. I switched it to Japanese to see the difference and it just created a different world of issues, some voices got better while others got worse but at the same time the quality was still bad so I switched it back to English.I almost want to recommend playing the game with the voices off (you can mute them specifically) but at the same time I feel that would take a bit away from the game, because at least Ringabel and Edea have fun things to say and they say it well, so... worth it. If I could mute Agn&egrave;s I would. Without question. I know they had to compress it because of the 3DS but... come on... you may as well not recorded half of it and saves some space there.Customization 10/10 - This is split into 2 seperate systemsJobsThrowing back to the FFV days, Square decided to reintroduce the Job system... and I could NOT be happier with this. The game calls it the Asterisk system but... I find that ridiculous so I'm going to call it the job system since they are actually called Jobs in the game anyway... I think they are just confused.The game has something like 23 or 24 different jobs that each character can be. As you defeat enemies you get both EXP and JP (Job Points). Jobs have levels and you advance them by gaining these job points. Each level will unlock either a new job skill or a new job ability. For Example a black mage unlocks tiers of magic as their skills. Level 1, 2, 3 etc... black magic. But that's not all they get, they also obtain abilities like Immunity to silence, Reduced damage from Lightning, etc... these abilities and skills can then be used for other jobs. So if I switch the Black mage to a white mage, I can set their secondary skills to be black magic. Now I can cast both White and Black magic as my White mage. The abilities are also interchangeable, by the end of the game you get 5 ability slots, each ability takes X number of slots (from 1 - 3 I believe) and each does something different. For instance monks gain +10% HP for 1 point, +20% Hp for 2 points and +30% HP for 3 points, combine that with the knights  + 20% physical Defense and you can make an impressive tank character. Or combine 2 Handed (Wield a weapon with 2 hands for double attack power) and +20% Physical Attack on a spell fencer for some massive elemental Damage.The combinations are vast and for me have been really fun to mix and match. I'm up against a boss right now that I can't beat just yet because of one attack it uses that deals massive water damage, so I'm working on unlocking abate water (50% reduced damage from water sources) so I can withstand that assault. The jobs, leveling them, unlocking skills and abilities keeps me interested far more than I thought in this game, and the only wish I had was that I had more characters in my group to try more combinations!You actually don't unlock the jobs through the main story line either, at least not all of them. So far apart from the first few I got as part of the tutorial, all of my jobs have been unlocked through side quests... and these aren't simple tiny side quests they are actual quests. There is trouble in town and you have to figure out what it is! I won't spoil the story but the first 2 side quests I took unlocked 4 more jobs for me to use. So getting all the jobs in the game is going to be fun. At this time I have 11 unlocked I believe. Ranger being my favorite, because it does MASSIVE damage and knows the weakpoints of most of my enemies... and I can use those skills on my other jobs so imagine having all those 1.5x damage skill, then switching to a spell fencer, enchanting your sword with fire and the 2 handed ability, then attacking a plant monster who is weak to fire with the ability that deals 50% more damage to plants... ooooh it's going to be a dead plant!SpecialsSo this game has something similar to limit breaks from FFVII, they are called Specials. You unlock them as the game progresses (more on this later) but you start with a couple in the beginning. Each weapon type has a few specials attached to it and various ways with which to trigger it. The Rod for example requires you to deal damage with magic spells 10 times, and it's special is a single target laser beam that deals heavy damage to 1 opponent... but that's not all. Each special has a secondary buff that is granted to your party for a few turns. So the rod's special also grants +20% additional Magic Damage for a few turns to the whole party. For another example, the Bow requires you to deal weak point damage to enemies 10 times (Rangers are good at that). The attack does massive damage to 1 enemy and raises your parties crit rate by 400% for a few turns... while also looking awesome. There are also support specials like Rejuvenation that heals the party etc... or buff the party and keep everyone protected.Now you may ask why this is under the customization section, well that's because the specials are customizable! As you progress through rebuilding the village (More later on this) you unlock abilities that you can equip to your specials. For instance you can make your special Water based, or Fire based, make it do more damage to plants or Dragons, have a higher crit rate etc... This can be a good and bad thing because it does require a bit of planning. I went into a boss fight with a special that actually healed the boss because it was water based and I forgot to switch it for lightning. But I think it's still awesome how we can change them, make them a little more ours... and not just with abilities. You can rename them! I renamed everything to try and include badger in the title. So Hack and Slash became Badger Strike. Rejuvenation became Badger's Light etc...You can also customize what your characters say when they use the specials. Slightly limited to like... 15 characters but still it's a nice touch. I know it's a nitpick but I would like to have my character say the line while attacking not afterwards. So As I'm shooting my arrow I want him to scream &#34;EULALIA!&#34; (as i have told him to do). not AFTER I have shot it.Combat - 8/10Now being me, I am rather biased against Turn based combat systems, They are either boring, or just insanely brutal against you to the point of tears (Hello Persona...) however I'm going to pick that bias up and throw it out the window for this because it deserves my full unbiased viewing.The combat is great, it's fun and more complicated than simply pressing a single button untill things die. This game isn't a sit back and watch the program type of combat. You have to think. Admittedly part of winning is the setup before combat which I think is a good thing. Think a bit before you go into a fight and your fight should be much faster. bravely Default However, adds a twist. The Brave/Default system really spices things up in my opinion. The system is simple, yet complicated. In combat you have three choices, Attack, Brave, or Default. Attack meaning you take your turn, attack or use a skill/spell expending 1 BP (or more if a skill requires it) and that's about it. As long as you don't have negative BP you can act, you regenerate 1 BP a turn normally up to maximum of 3. Default allows you to defend, taking less damage and not acting this turn, in effect restoring 1 BP. Now these two options are fairly normal... then we get to the third option, and it's one I think makes the game stand out above others. The Brave Option.The Brave option allows you to act more than once when it's your turn. You can use it up to 3 times in 1 turn (Using 4 BP to do so). This allows you to use 4 attacks in 1 go, however it can leave you with a massive amount of Negative BP, which means you can't attack or defend until you don't have negative BP.The system may seem risky and it is, but it has purposes which Are brought forth by the job system. For instance one of the first skills you get as a monk is Invigorate, which increases your attack power by 25% for 2 turns (It has a chance to fail but lets for the sake of argument say it didn't!). Now in most instances you could only get 2 attacks off with that bonus attack, but if you use Brave to get 4 attacks in 1 turn off, you get to hit for 25% power 3 more times than usual. Of course after which you are usually exposed for a turn or 2, but who cares! Another good example is that say you just hit by a massive painful attack, 2 of your characters have died, and your white mage needs to get them up. Well use all 4 braves and you can cast raise twice, then cura twice. And if your like me your white mage was Defaulting for a few turns so he won't be left defenseless after a turn like that. It's just a lot of fun.Now, there are more risks than Just the obvious You can't act for a bit. The enemy can do this as well, they can use Brave and Default. More than once I've fought a boss that used Default the exact turn I decided to throw everything I had at him, and I ended up losing because He withstood my assault and destroyed my soul. It also makes the game a little less easy to predict, and adds a bit of fun to it. You never really know what the enemy is going to do! They are also limited by BP so don't expect them to attack 9 times or something. You can at all times see what the bosses BP is so you can guess on if you are about to be slammed by death or not.Now it's not perfect, and I didn't know where to take points off in this section or another but I chose this one. It being a JRPG does mean there is some grinding involved. And everyone who has played this type knows what I mean. You run around in circles on the map waiting for random encounters, you find a strategy that kills them in one turn and you keep doing that over and over and over again, Sometimes that Strat is a bit harder to find but once found it works endlessly. So I am not a big fan of that part, I can handle it, and it is still fun getting to that next job level. The game does progression amazingly well, you really do feel like you are gaining power with each level increase.The other point I take off is because of the fact that sometimes I feel like the AI is cheating. This may be me being paranoid, but rarely does the computer default until RIGHT after I decide to use everything I have at once, it's almost like clockwork. I think it waits and then acts after I've made a decision. It's annoying! but... alas it's probably my faut for trying to do everything in one turn. One other thing I will say is that the bosses are rough. Really rough. They require planning and have some incredibly cheap and devastating attacks.Network Features and Mini Things - 7/10Here we get into some of the slight issues I have with the game. This being the year 2013 (I know it's 2014 but the game was release originally in 2013!) We have decided that everything has to involve friends and friends lists and the internet and stuff. A theory that I sadly don't prescribe to. However, I can't fault it for trying either. There are just some key issues I think don't work that well and they inhibit the game somewhat. First I'll explain what it involves though.You can Summon friends to help you in combat, as well as be summoned by others. Now I don't mean a co-op or anything it's still a single player game. What I do mean is that if you have an internet connection you can register an attack or a heal and send it to your buddies to use as an attack in their game. For example I cast Rejuvenate on my entire Party and send it to the internet. Anyone on my friend's list can now summon my character and cast rejuvenate on their party (only once though). The more friends you have on your friends list the more options you can have to summon etc... Now there is an inherent issue with this. This being a Nintendo game, it's STILL annoying as hell to register people onto your friends list. You have to exchange codes and all that fun crap still, and without a forum or a central place where you are giving people codes you will not get them. You also have to have a wireless internet connection which yes at this point is fairly common but not everyone has it. The good thing is, Summoning and sending doesn't really add much to the game other than a bit of fun. The other feature however is more reliant on it.There is a mini-game in this game, and it's the restoration effort for Tiz's village. You can restore Shops, Get new specials, get special modifiers as well as weapons and armor you can't buy elsewhere in the game. This is a time consuming game that thankfully performs all it's tasks in the background or while your 3DS is in sleep mode. As I write this review, my villagers are at home building my shops up, and each one will take about 6 hours to do so. I left some major projects going while I went to work. Now you start the game with 1 villager, and he can build up things slowly. If you connect to the internet 1 time a day you slowly gain more and more villagers, this really helps in the restoration effort. But it also highlights the biggest problem I have. What if you don't have that option. If you can't connect to the internet, or you can't find anyone with spot pass... you are stuck with 1 villager and the amount of time it would take for him to do everything is months. And in that line, you would miss out on a lot of specials and cool items. It is easily remedied by going to a free Wi-Fi place which... heck I think even McDonald's has free wi-fi now, but still it's a tad off.Then there is the one thing I think wasn't needed in this game, it actually has a Micro transaction shop in it. What can you buy? Gear? Armor? Items? Noooo... you can buy Turns to use in combat. That's right.. you can Buy the ability to use an additional turn. I don't know the cost, because the first one is discounted at 50 cents and I didn't buy it. The other way to gain additional SP (That's the currency for extra turns) is to put the 3DS into sleep mode for 8 hours with the game running it's tasks. You can have up to 3 and can use them in combat whenever you want by pressing the start button. Honestly though. I don't really see the need for buying them. I can't say it's like the devil that it's in the game, but I have to question why it's there in the first place. It seems... just... odd to me.Which also brings up my final thought on the mini-game... you do have to keep your 3DS in sleep mode CONSTANTLY. Right now mine is plugged into the wall at home, and It's going to be on for a very very long time considering how much of the village I have to restore. I mean 5 villagers working on clearing one step of the village will take 20 hours. (99 alone!). But it is always a joy to come home or wake up after letting them work for 8 hours and getting all those rewards. No you can't pay to get them to work faster!You also have the ability to customize a few bits of difficulty in the game. Allowing you to change the frequency of encounters from 0 (none) to +100% (A lot more). This allows for better grinding, or getting back to town if you really didn't wanna fight things 20 levels lower than you! You can also enable or disable JP, EXP, Autosave, and change the difficulty from Normal to Hard or Easy. Hard mode... In my opinion is just frustrating and gives no reward for you actually playing in hard mode. At least none that I saw. It makes every fight brutal and basic enemies can one shot you, I didn't honestly enjoy it all that much, so I switched back to normal. And even then bosses destroy me. Seriously though I could not play this game without Autosave, I forget to save too often and would be annoyed with losing time!All in all, I give the game 9 Bitter Badgers out of 10. It's fantastic, and I can't seem to stop playing the damn thing. If you liked Final Fantasy Anything before XII, you will probably love this game. It has customization, craziness, and joy around every corner. The combat is fun yet challenging, the bosses may be a bit brutal, bit nothing a little grinding or better planning won't fix!TLDR Version: 9/10.Pros+Good risk vs. Reward combat+Decent Characters with lots of cliches thrown in+Nearly unparalleled amount of Customization for the type of game it is. From jobs to abilities to your special attacks.+Decent Story, doesn't hold the game up and has some fun dialog+Challenging if you want it to be.+Fairly easy if you want it to be, there is even an auto battle feature+It's final Fantasy V-2. No other way to put it!Cons-Voice acting is atrocious-Sometimes the AI can feel cheap-The internet features can be limiting if youo don't have the option to connect to them.-Did I mention the voice acting is BAD?-If you went digital it takes up basically an entire 4gb SD card.-Gotta leave your 3DS in sleep mode for the village to be rebuilt in any logical amoutn of time even with a good amount of villagers.", "This game is okay, and it has excellent graphics, interesting storyline, and great character development, but the two things that irk me about it is that the battle system makes regular enemy encounters way too easy and then there is the part where you must repeat chapters 1-4 5 times in a row. Also, I think Airy should have been the final boss! She was way more interesting! All in all, this is an okay game. I don't believe it deserves 1 star, but I also don't think it deserves 5 stars. If you disagree with me for a logical and realistic reason, I'm fine with that.", "This is a final fantasy game in every way except for the title. There is an open world to explore, towns to visit, jobs to unlock, and dungeons to explore. The graphics are stunning, and in my opinion it looks like it is almost on par with the playstation 3 system. The voice acting is just ok. Square enix could have found better actors. In my opinion, the battle system isn't really innovative and new .you can do things like save up points so you can take another turn in battle and perform  addtional actions. If you are a fan of rpgs then buy it. It's worth the money and time to play. Also, if you would like games like this to continue to be released on nintendo platforms, then you must support these games. Many third party devs are starting to avoid developing games on nintendo platforms because thier games dont sell well. The (wii u) is the perfect example of this fact. It seems like developers are slowly abandoning nintendo platforms. Support third party devs so we can continue getting games like this", "i haven't been this absorbed in a game in a long time. i played the demo and completed it and immediately preordered this. the graphics are unrivaled by any other 3ds game. beautiful art style. some times i just stop playing an admire the backgrounds. great battle and job system. very good tutorial. it can be as in depth as you want and makes it easy to refer back to something in case you missed it. story isn't too bad either so far. one of the few games i actually pursue the side quests. utmost highest recommendation for any rpg fan.", "Where do I begin? Aside from the bizzaro name (Bravely Default? WTF? Should have just stuck with Winged Angel Girl) this game is as solid as a Metapod using harden - seriously it's good enough for a Pokemon reference!The brave/default risk-reward system is exciting and makes for a lot of fun battles. The story is great and the characters are extremely lovable. You will find yourself staying up unreasonably late playing this game.I guess there's a neat multiplayer aspect to this game but I have not gotten to it yet. Bonus points to Square Enix for thinking of these things - looking at you Capcom's Monster Hunter Ultimate 3!Do yourself a favor and add this remarkable game to your collection!", "This RPG has really disappointing music, boring as molasses gameplay, is grindy as a cheese grater (it has an automatic battle mode if that tells you anything), and sometimes horrible dialogue. The plot is at least riveting enough to keep you playing though. But good god, some of the dialogue...", "The Story of this game is soo boring. This game is nothing like final fantasy, bad job Square Enix. Plus Nintendo 3ds has horrible graphics", "After Chapter Four, it constantly repeats itself until Chapter 8! What the heck?  I was tedious at best. The ending is only a shocker if you have lived under a rock for years...This is not the best that Square Enix has to offer. I have no idea why everyone things this is so good...Its not. Now, it is not a total failure ...but it is annoying.There are good parts of the game ...so it is not a total wash ...but I think they ruined it with constant repetition...I got to a point where I just could not wait for it to be over....and I put in 127 hours... I got to level 99 and got all the job asterisks...but in the end ..it was not worth that amount of time to play the game.", "\"I don't know about you, but I have sure missed the kind of PlayStation JRPGs, and specifically the Final Fantasy games, that Squaresoft published in the 90's. The many classics from that era had an intangible magic that is fairly rare in the industry these days. Thankfully, Bravely Default is a lovely gem that could easily be mistaken for some long-lost Squaresoft gem from that period, and playing it reminds me of the way it feels playingFinal Fantasy IXandXenogears. This is a special treat. Warning: somewhat long review incoming, either buckle up, or jump ship now if that's not your thing. Having become intimately acquainted with the eshop demo, as well as putting it quite a few hours into the main game by now, I feel confident in my ability to give an informative, honest assessment.The story in Bravely Default features four protagonists, all of which have backstories that any veteran of the genre would regard as painfully cliche at first glance. You get Tiz Arrior, a young man recently beset by horrible tragedy and great loss. He is joined by Anges Oblige, a sheltered priestess girl who must save the world by healing huge crystals through prayer, Ringabel, an amnesiac ladies man with a magical book, and finally Edea Lee, a spy for an enemy nation who joins the heroes at a later point (try to guess why she does this. Here's a hint, it's cliche, lol). Of course, political intrigue, giant elemental crystals, and world saving shenanigans ensue. It almost sounds like a \"\"Four protagonists walk into a JRPG\"\" bar joke, doesn't it? Thankfully, what Bravely Default's story lacks in innovation, it more than makes up for in execution. The writing in this game is, for the most part, very well done. The story is mostly coherent and moves along at a good pace with memorable events that make sense. The characters are all generally likable and developed well. Plenty of endearing humor offers a nice counterweight to the serious moments. There's a nice balance between freedom and structure, so you never feel strangled by linearity or lost with no guidance. Overall, Bravely Default is a very charming, well-written JRPG adventure. All of this is more than I can say for anyFinal Fantasy from the last several years(sadly), so Bravely Default gets a big thumbs up from me in its plot and story structure. It's very enjoyable to take in. It's a definite throwback to the classics of yesteryear and makes for a good adventure.To aid in the sense of adventure of the story are the visuals, all of which are influenced by hand drawn art, water color paintings, and old-timey children's fairy tale books. It's very unique, full of imagination, and quite beautiful. The visual designs of the settings in this game are nothing short of brilliant. Wondering around the various locales, all of which are quite unique, really reminded me of how I felt playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time. Amazing. The 3-D effect does even more to add dynamic impact to the visuals too. It's no stretch to say the awesome settings add a lot to the game's story. Akihiko Yoshida, known for his work designing characters in games likeVagrant Story,Final Fantasy Tactics, and the recentFinal Fantasy DS remakes, did the character designs in this game. To be honest, this aspect will probably be a love-or-hate thing for people. His stylized art tends to be. While some characters are kind of silly looking and clumsy (more on that later), I personally like the character design for the most part. All-in-all, Bravely Default is an undeniably gorgeous 3DS game.Let's talk about sound for a moment, and specifically the soundtrack. Let me put it this way... If you told me that the soundtrack in this game was some long-lost collaboration betweenYasunori MitsudaandNobuo Uematsufrom the 90's, I'd probably believe you. Seriously, Bravely Default's soundtrack is amazing. It has the striking emotive melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the lovely sophistication and elegant refinement of Uetmatsu's work. Every song fits its purpose perfectly for every situation/scenario/circumstance. Indeed, \"\"Revo\"\" nailed the soundtrack in this game. Other than that, most of the sound effects in the game are appropriately nostalgic. There's a surprisingly large amount of voice acting in the game, and thankfully most of the time it falls between acceptable and exceptional (keywords there being \"\"most of the time\"\").As a JRPG, Bravely Default works very well mechanically. All of the basics in the game are very well refined and play as well as any classic Final Fantasy game would. However, there are a couple twists in place that make this more than just an adequate FF clone. For one, the battle system features an \"\"action point\"\" system wherein each action, be it attack, use an item, etc. costs you 1 \"\"Brave Point.\"\" In \"\"Brave Mode,\"\" you can go all out up to a deficit of 3 BP, meaning you can attack an enemy four times in a single turn if you want. Beware though, because if still standing, the enemies get to wail on you for four turns in a row.  Then there's \"\"Default Mode,\"\" which is basically a turtle-up move that allows you to accumulate BP for later use, while greatly increasing your defense for that turn's duration. This system has a fantastic feeling of risk vs. reward that encourages and prizes smart strategy, and I appreciate that.The other unique aspect in this game is its robust job system. Anyone who has playedFinal Fantasy Vwill know what I'm talking about. Each distinct \"\"job\"\" or class has different stats and abilities and most (but not all) fall under archetypal roles (ie. White/Black/Red/Time Mage, Monk, Thief, Ninja, Knight, Swordmaster, etc), and you can change any character's class on the fly under most circumstances. There's a huge number of team combos you can achieve with this that not only allows for deeper strategy, but guarantees that every player can have a unique experience catered to their tastes. It's really great fun. Usually, I find bare-bones turn-based RPGs to grow rather boring shortly. Thankfully, the job system and Bravely Default combat modes makes this a very engaging RPG. Throw in unique streetpass features and an incredibly large amount of options that makes the game experience tailored to virtually any player, and you get a cocktail of smart design choices. All of this makes Bravely Default a unique, deeply refined JRPG that makes the experience stand out among its source inspirations.For the sake of being fair and all that, let's talk about some criticisms for the game. Like I said earlier, the character style will be a love-hate thing. Since the job system changes character outfits, the only constant distinguishing feature of the main characters is their face and their hair. Unfortunately, two of the main characters, Ringabel and Edea, have hair styles that look stupidly ridiculous, even for an anime character, which is a shame. Again, I usually really enjoy Yoshida's work, and it's *mostly* great here, but some designs fall short. Also, some \"\"job\"\" outfits look ludicrous in certain cutscenes. Try imagining a serious scene playing out while Ringabel is wearing the Las Vegas Elvis suit (complete with aviator shades) that the Performer job has, or the fox-mask wearing Ranger... You can't do it without laughing. Kind of ruins the serious vibe in those scenes. The pre-rendered cutscenes, while having stunning detail, feature characters with a bizarre, somewhat unappealing combination of chibi and realistic proportions and details that I'm not a huge fan of. It's a little off-putting if you ask me. The mechanics of the game are awesome except for one admittedly small thing that still really sticks in my craw. There's a special sleep ability you can use to make battles much easier. You replenish your supply by putting the 3DS is sleep mode for eight hours (pain), OR, pay REAL money in a micro-transaction. Now, to be fair, the game is balanced so you don't *need* it, but still... Call me old fashioned, but if I pay this much for a game, I expect every feature to be included, no strings attached. Micro-transactions in a game like this is just plain ugly in my opinion, and glaringly so in a game meant to salute past classics.  You stay classy Square Enix. This sort of stuff is why people these days call you an evil/incompetent out-of-touch corporation. None of these issues are \"\"game breakers\"\" per se, some are admittedly very nit picky (except for the microtransaction aspect), but they are worth mentioning for the sake of fairness.Bravely Default is, by and large, a great 3DS game, despite some nit-picks here and there. If I could be more specific, I'd rate this game somewhere between an 8.5-9 out of 10. In many ways, this game is a wonderful salute to the kinds of JRPGs Square made for the PS1 back in the day. In fact, I'd say that Bravely Default is to PS1 JRPG masterpieces whatRadiant Historiais to SNES JRPG masterpieces: a nostalgic homage while still offering enough new ideas to feel like a genuinely unique and fresh JRPG for the modern age. All things considered, I'd highly recommend Bravely Default to the majority of RPG fan/3DS owners who, like me, miss the kind of quality JRPG releases of yesteryear. Buy it, gather up your trusty four protagonists, and prepare to save yet another world in a new (but not final, sequel already confirmed) fantasy.\"", "\"Like many of you portable RPGers out there, I had been looking forward to this title for a long time. I've been a bit... put off... by Square-Enix's recent titles, but I can't refuse a free demo. The demo, if you haven't played it, wasn't taken directly from the game. The main mechanics and characters are the same, but the world and quests in the demo were created specifically for the demo to give players an idea of the gameplay. The demo was fantastic and definitely reaffirmed my decision to pre-order the game. However, after playing about 8 hours into the full version, I can tell you that the demo was a mere shadow of what to expect.Bravely Default is a sequel to 4 Heroes of Light in that Final Fantasy II is a sequel to Final Fantasy. The overall design and themes are very similar but the characters and world are different. Genre-wise, it walks a thin line between classic RPG and Dungeon Crawler - a formula that works extremely well.The story is, essentially, 4 young people from different walks of life coming together through adverse circumstances to restore order to the four elemental crystals (hmmm, this sounds familiar) and save their planet. I realize that I just summarized the plot of several Final Fantasy titles, but - as always - they've made it unique and added enough character and story to make it its own. 99% of the dialogue is voice acted and it is done well. I will admit, I am not a voice acting aficionado, so people may disagree with me on this point.Gameplay is very interesting. Square-Enix got a bit experimental with the mechanics which I find very exciting. While the SNES era of Squaresoft will always hold a special place in my heart, I loved how innovative they were during the Playstation days. I felt that they really pushed the envelope and attempted new things, something I don't feel they have done much of over the past few years... at least until now.Bravely Default (yes, I think it's a stupid name too) gets its name from the battle system. Combat is turn based in the traditional sense, but you can select the Brave command up to 3 times to take up to four turns at once. The downside of this is that every time you select Brave, your taking away your next turn. This means you may have to wait through several enemy turns while your turn gauge catches back up. So, if you don't defeat your enemy, you may be forced to watch - helplessly - as your team gets slaughtered for up to four turns in a row. Fortunately, the Brave/Default command is per party member, so while you may max out your Brave on your Monk so he can hit four times in a row, you can let your White Mage take their turns one at a time so they can dole out the cures and eliminate status effects after each attack.The Default option is essentially Defend, only it allows you to save your turns as well(up to 3). So, using the White Mage as an example again, I max out Brave on all my offensive party members. The boss is still standing and their turn gauges are all at -4 meaning they have to wait through four turns before they can act again. I opt to let my White Mage take their turns one at a time, taking each turn as it comes, healing my party. The boss makes his next attack and misses, there's no need to heal anyone. Instead of attacking with my White Mage for paltry damage, I'll select Default. My White Mage will Defend and my turn meter will increase by 1 (meaning I have an extra turn saved up). Let's say this happens twice more, now my White Mage has 3 turns (the maximum) saved up on top of their standard turn. Then the boss unleashes a massive attack that blinds my Monk, kills my black mage and deals heavy damage to everyone else. No worries, my White Mage has four turns saved up! I hit Brave three times to use up my saved turns on top of my current turn and cast Raise on my Black Mage, Blindna on the Monk and Cura twice. These actions all happen in succession and now my party is now fully restored. Because I had turns saved up from Defaulting, I'll be able to take my next turn as usual because Brave didn't put me into a deficit.It probably sounds complicated, but it really isn't. It's a unique twist on turn based combat that adds an element of calculated risk to the equation. It's a great spin on turn based combat that allows you a little extra control over the flow of the battle. Keep in mind though, the enemies can also use Brave and Default, so you may get a boss that will attack four times in a row, but remember they'll have to wait four turns to act again as well. There are also job abilities that can add brave points to your teammates or subtract them from your enemy which adds an additional element of strategy, allowing you to act sooner or keeping the enemy from acting longer.Another new mechanic is called Sleep Points. You have a gauge that fills whenever the game is put in sleep mode. For every eight hours you get one SP or Sleep Point, these points can be used to get an extra turn in the middle of battle regardless of your brave or default status where you act immediately. You can also buy sleep points with real world money if you feel that they're necessary. I'm never a fan of micro-transactions, but the game is perfectly playable to its fullest extent without buying additional Sleep Points, so this doesn't bother me.There are 24 jobs (classes) in Bravely Default and you can switch your character's job on the fly, as long as you are not in battle. Jobs are obtained by defeating key bosses that represent the job. So, for instance, everyone starts out as a Freelancer. Shortly into the story you will fight a Monk and a White Mage. When you defeat them, you obtain an item called an \"\"asterisk\"\".  This item unlocks that job for all your party members. You party members will level up with experience points as per usual, but your job will level up independently of your party member's level with job points collected from each battle. Each job level grants you additional abilities and attributes for that job. For instance each level of a Mage job will give you access to more powerful spells.Attributes are passive abilities. These are gained by leveling up jobs. Once you unlock attributes, you can set them to the party member even if they change jobs. For instance, the Valkyrie attribute - Piercing - can be set to a Ninja to make them more effective against armored enemies. Each attribute has a numeric value and each party member has a maximum value their slotted attributes can equal. For instance, if your party member's attributes can't equal more than 5, you can't slot in 3 attributes that have a value of 2. Using the right Job and Attribute combination can make for a REALLY powerful party. It's a nice element of customization and strategy that rewards experimentation that's really rewarding.Lastly, you can use one set of existing job abilities in addition to your job specific abilities. An example would be, if you mastered the Black Mage job on one of your party members and you want to have them start the White Mage job. You can select Black Magic as their extra ability set and still have access to the spells they learned. It's essentially a sub-job. This can also make for powerful combinations and support opportunities.Traveling takes place just as a standard RPG, you enter towns and dungeons via the world map and either run on foot or use vehicles (depending on where you are in the story) to navigate around the globe. Random battles take place both inside and outside dungeons. The encounter rate didn't seem too extreme either way.Part of the game centers around rebuilding a town. You collect townsfolk via Streetpass tags. Each time you get a tag, even if it's the same person, an additional townsperson will be added.  Building shops, upgrading shops and clearing paths take real world time for your townspeople. When you want to complete these tasks you can select how many of your townspeople you would like to work on it. Increasing the townspeople assigned to a task greatly increases the speed in which it is completed. You can put everyone on one project and get it done quickly, or spread the townsfolk around more strategically and get several tasks done simultaneously. Rebuilding shops gives you access to purchase their goods when you're at a save point. Upgrading shops increases the quality of the goods offered. Clearing road blocks gives you access to previously inaccessible shops. As you upgrade shops, rebuild and repopulate your town you will receive care packages from your townsfolk including potions and items. Upgrading shops also grants you different abilities based on the weapons you're using. Once you have assigned your townsfolk work, you can return to the gameplay and they will let you know when they have finished.Every once in awhile a Nemesis may arrive in your town, usually piggybacked on a Streetpass tag. These are powerful enemies you may choose to fight for exp. and items. Only 7 can be present at a time (check their level first so you don't find that you're in over your head) the oldest ones will age off as new ones arrive unless you choose to \"\"protect\"\" one, saving it for later. You can choose to send select Nemesis with your Streetpass tags to other players.Speaking of Streetpass, you can also send your party's information via Streetpass to your registered friends. While in battle, they can call on your to jump in and execute an attack. You can also pass along special moves to your friends and each of their party members can slot a single special move received from you.Graphically, this is the prettiest game I've seen on the 3DS. The hand-painted backgrounds are beautifully done. Details like waterfalls and moving objects are plentiful. I've wandered around the city in day and night just examining the details. The 3D was expertly handled and you can tell they put some real thought into it instead of just making the moving stuff come forward and sticking everything else in the back. The demo looked good, but the finished product looks amazing!Sound is beautifully done. The 3D sound is executed well and the gorgeous music pairs perfectly with the breathtaking scenery. This game is aesthetically brilliant.The Collector's Edition (as long as it wasn't smashed by Amazon) is well worth the fifty bucks. You get the game, obviously. It also comes with a very nice/large - softcover - artbook. The artbook has paintings and detailed sketches, character designs, etc. It's one of the best CE artbooks I've seen in a long time. The soundtrack is great, 10 tracks total. The AR cards come packaged like a deck of cards and allow you to see interactive cut scenes. The art on the cards is pretty cool as well. The packaging is just about twice the size of the SMT: IV packaging. If I had to do it over again, I would definitely still buy the CE, which is more than I can say for several other titles released over the past few years.Overall, Bravely Default is one of the most refreshing RPG experiences I've played in years. The amount of customization and strategy included in this title make gameplay a blast! It is extremely robust! There is so much put into this game, it's a bit overwhelming at first. However, the learning curve and tutorials are done very well and you'll be on your way in no time. Graphically it is gorgeous. The story is well done and very much an active experience, things are constantly happening to advance the story and provide insight to the world around you. Traditional RPG and Dungeoncrawler elements are fused seamlessly and perfectly. It really reminds me of the kind of innovative game Squaresoft put out on the PSOne and I love every second of it! This is a must buy for any 3DS owner!\"", "I'm an old person. I grew up playing games on the Commodore 64 and Atari, later it branched out into turn based strategy games like Civilization. Last year I got a 3DS to play with the kids. I got about 3 hours into Professor Lawton, and then I kind of forgot about it. Enter Bravely Default - I read the reviews and it reminded me of some of the turned based D&D games I played as a kid. So I took a chance and bought the CE addition (i had a coupon at BB) and I haven't been able to stop playing it ever since. It is very addicting. The skills/jobs/ability combinations keep me up at night, trying to figure out the best combination for each. yes, it is that addicting."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.01256990060210228, 0.14187458157539368, 0.08346773684024811, 0.0195920392870903, 0.09689681231975555, 0.014876353554427624, 0.0697677731513977, 0.07296077162027359, 0.06311105936765671, 0.08986781537532806, 0.08906139433383942, 0.02289608307182789, 0.08404981344938278, 0.005223945248872042, 0.007993531413376331, 0.12579035758972168]]}
