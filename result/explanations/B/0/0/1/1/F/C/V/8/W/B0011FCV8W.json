Not very good tracking compared to my normal mouse. I just plugged in my old one and sent this one back right away.", "You have to charge this mouse first before use it.  But if the Led flashes red repeatedly the mouse will not charge.  So I could not use it.  Refund.", "Poor reception when working... Does not want to charge..  Slow and jumpy response..I really like the feature set of this mouse.  It has a great look, nice shape and weight, and the charging station is a nice bonus vs replacing batteries.  It's too bad it just doesn't work.I can't imagine every unit for this model is assembled as poorly as the one I received.  If this mouse worked I would have happily written a good review based on price and functionality. However, if you decide to roll the dice be prepared for a high probability of having to return it.Good luck.", "\"It's not like me to get down on a product, but this mouse systematically frustrates me. First let me say that my right hand is continually on aLogitech MX 1100 Cordless Laser Mouse (910-000718)or on aLogitech 931689-0403 MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse (Black)and that has me spoiled. Accuracy is the game, and Logitech has that parameter cornered. (At least in comparison to this Microsoft 7000.) What were they thinking? Ok so let me blabber...Setup is a breeze. Install the CD. Place the included NiMHD battery in the mouse, plug in the charger base, and park the mouse on it for an hour before your first use, and more like 5 for a complete charge. That is one thing that many will find favorable with this mouse is that the charging base is more like a flat heating pad, so it is a natural inclination to park the mouse on it, whereas the Logitech MX Revolution has an upright stand, that more often than not, results in many users forgetting to park it on the stand, at least overnight. The Logitech MX1100 has eliminated the whole battery recharge thing altogether with a super efficient design, that enables you to get a ridiculous amount of time out of a single battery.Ok, now onto the problem. I am sure you can appreciate how frustrating it is to try and click on an icon, a very small icon, and every time you race across the page, the cursor either over shoots the destination, or it is off to the left or right, and you have to make a second gesture to \"\"correct steer\"\" the thing. Getting efficient at navigating around saves a lot of time, and a lot of work; this mouse is a lot of work. Oh it has a setting that you can check off that gives it \"\"enhanced pointer precision\"\", but even though that is a great improvement over the old can't hit the broad side of a barn right out of the box setting, on a finer level it still doesn't come close to the efficiency of the Logitech's, plus when you reboot the computer, the \"\"enhanced pointer precision\"\" goes right back to un-ehanced pointer sloppy setting. Who wants to go back into their computer settings every time you reboot the computer? I know I sure don't.I just noticed the Logitech's are going for less now than at introduction, with the MX Revolution going for one third of the original price. I like the MX 1100 a little bit better due to button positioning, but if I was looking at other mice in the price range, I would be buying the MX Revolution instead. The MX Revolution was 99 dollars at introduction, and I couldn't rave about it enough. (See my review on the same page)Ok let me throw this Microsoft mouse a bone. It has a cool multi-window feature, one click and you can see multiple windows of each program that you have open. Logitech gives you a menu of them instead. Once again for speed the Logitech, having a menu of choices appear automatically directly under where you already have your mouse is better than several windows open a lot all over the screen.The Microsoft 7000 also has a lighter, (cheaper) feel to it. The Logitech is built very solid, and is heavier, but I am not lifting the thing, I am only sliding it around on a flat surface. That is the next thing I want to talk about, the surface. The Logitech will track accurately on clear plastic. You can mouse around on your pant leg, a natural finish wood desk, or anything, oh yeah, including a mouse pad. In that regard the MSFT comes very close, but not to the extent of the Logitech. The other cool thing the MSFT mouse has is a built in magnifier. Click on it, and you don't need glasses to see the fine print, no matter how old you are. (I can say that because I am not that young myself:-)The Logitech's also have leatherette sides to them, with little pin holes which are great for gripping. The MX1100 has the best button layout, and then comes the Revolution, and yes last place is reserved for the MSFT mouse. The side buttons, although I don't know why, they are just not as easy to use. The other challenge is the round wheel on the top. It is almost like you have to do a balancing act while pressing it down. Sort of like don't let it wiggle to the left or the right while pressing on it. A super big frustrater is trying to double click on something, the cursor moves on the first click, so it doesn't register the second one, so I find myself going to war with the small icons that require a double click; the Logitech doesn't do that. At the risk of appearing snobby, if you are using a very inexpensive mouse, and have to shovel it across the mouse pad, you know, push then lift, push then lift, this Microsoft mouse will seem like a dream in comparison; between it's multitude of available uses for each assignable button, to it's sleek design, reminiscent of the Logitechs, the sloppiness will seem a bit more natural. Once you use the logitechs that I mentioned, you will wonder where they have been hiding all of your life.There are a few extra features gone over in the product description, and since many others have already commented about them, no need to go into it here. The main thing to me is accuracy. Having to fight with your mouse is not the way to go about computing. I know this is not Microsoft's top entry in mouseville, but I would leave this one behind. Get a Logitech.\"", "This is the first wireless mouse i have ever used and i am VERY pleased with it.First of all,the setup could not be easier.You just put the receiver into your USB port,turn on the mouse and pop in the CD,that's it!After you install the software you can adjust the mouse settings to your liking but you really don't need to adjust anything because it's set to medium right out of the box,which works perfectly well.The first thing i noticed is how responsive & accurate the mouse is,this is because it uses a high definition laser that guides the pointer.No matter what you are using this mouse for,work,web browsing,online gaming,this thing is dead on!Very accurate.The feel of this mouse is also nice.The left side of it is curved inward as well as the upper right side,this makes it comfortable to use for hours on end because it puts less strain on your hand and fingers.When it comes time to charge up the battery you just put the mouse on top of the charger and leave it for a few hours.The scroll wheel at the top of the mouse makes it easy to navigate web pages,desktop menus in Vista and also item menus in PC games.I can't say a single bad thing about this product.Microsoft did an outstanding job making this mouse.Excellent product.", "The only problem is the charging of this mouse. There is a button under the battery that needs to be depressed by the battery for the mouse to charge. After some research non the web about why this battery wouldn't take a charge I got a hit on the issue. I simply folded a very small piece of paper around the middle of the battery and it was enough to depress the button. Now everything is all good. Charging like a champ.", "\"I gave this mouse the acid test: image editing in Adobe Photoshop. It succeeded admirably at all the basic mouse tasks, and gave me great precision. The software is very configurable, but the documentation is oddly lacking in basic information.This is a very high resolution mouse, which is a step up from the standard LED mouse I've been using. You will want to play with the settings, because this mouse gives you many more configuration options than any other mouse I've used. For example, in additional to vertical scrolling with the mouse wheel, it includes horizontal scrolling when you press the wheel sideways. This is very convenient in Photoshop, when you are zoomed in and want to navigate around the image. You can also set up a magnifier window, macro editor, application switcher, and a whole host of other functions on the available buttons. I've currently set one thumb button to Undo (control-z), which seems like it could be productive.When the mouse needs recharging, just drop it into the included cradle for a few hours. This is quite convenient. Battery life is quite long-I've gone a week without needing a recharge yet.There is one operational down side: The scroll wheel has no \"\"clicks\"\" or stops. It just scrolls smoothly to any position. This is fine when used for scrolling or editing in Photoshop, but gets very annoying when using software that expects there to be stops. I have gotten very attached to scroll wheel functionality in many of my applications, so this annoyance can be significant.Now for the documentation. The quick start pamphlet will get you started, and successfully walk you through the installation. It tells you to insert the battery and to turn the mouse on using the switch on the bottom of the mouse. Oddly, the help file makes no mention of either the mouse power button or the \"\"three arcs\"\" buttons on the mouse and USB transceiver. So I do not know whether I should turn the mouse off when not in use to save power, which is an obvious question. Regarding the other button, I'm guessing from the three semi-circular arcs that it has something to do with the radio signal being sent, but whether it turns that signal on or off, or resets it, or synchronizes something, there's no mention anywhere.This lack of documentation is particularly annoying because in searching for the answer about the power button, I had to sort through these topics that describe features my device does not have:* Maintaining Battery Life in a Presenter Mouse* Using Flash Memory on a Wireless Mouse* Connecting a Bluetooth Mouse* Mouse LCD DisplayYou get the idea. I am annoyed because it is clear that a lot of good design effort went into this device, but I cannot find out the answer to my first, and so far only, questions. When should I turn the power switch on and off?Summary: Works well, with the exception of the non-clicking scroll wheel. Documentation lacking. If these don't bother you, this may be a five star mouse for you. I would give it three and a half, but amazon doesn't allow half stars, and three stars seems too harsh for a wireless mouse that works well and has many useful features.[Jan 2010] Update after daily use for a year:The battery lasts a long time-about two months. I've only recharged it about 5 or 6 times.The lack of clicks on the scroll wheel still annoys me, and pisses off others who try to use my computer.\"", "Get the blu-track 6000 mouse from MS instead of this one.  This one feels hard and is not comfortable to use.  The battery takes a long time to charge and the rechargeable one that comes with the mouse is pure garbage and last maybe a week or two before it wont charge anymore.  So Plan on using just regular AAA batteries.  The transmitter is also not built to last and died rather quick.  Not a good mouse.", "The Battery that came with mine was corroded. Probably from sitting in warehouses since 2010 which is the date of manufacture. I already had extra rechargeable AAA batteries sitting around so I just swapped it out and have had no problems. Other than that it is exactly what you would expect. A medium quality, rechargeable and ergonomic mouse. I'm not a huge fan of how it was assembled as you can feel the creases along the silver strip and it is way lighter than I am used to but that may just be because I'm use to mice that need 2 x AA. just by going to the single AAA you loose a lot of weight. It had no problem working automatically when I hooked it up to my 32-bit XP PC nor did I have a problem connecting to my 64-bit windows 7 machine. I didn't even need to pair them up. The connector sits about 3 feet away plugged directly into the back of my PC and I have great connection until about 6 feet. I love the built in charger and on/off switch. seriously, for $20 this is really a no-brainer.  You get a great Microsoft wireless mouse with decent range and a built in charger with decent battery life and good ergonomics. I would pay that for a standard wired mouse.", "Mouse is very good one, except on the right side of the mouse, the coating starting pealing off and i had to remove it completely so that its even. Else, its been more than 6 months and i have not changed battery.", "I like the idea of a wireless mouse -- the less wires running across and behind the desk, the better in my opinion. However, when I'm not using it, I do keep the mouse in the recharger cradle, so there's still technically some cables to deal with. But the charge lasts long - five days of general use (four hours a day) before a recharge was required.A few things: I'm not crazy that the USB connector juts out so far. The USB port on my PC tower is in the front of my computer, so it can be bumped and jarred loose. On my Mac, I've got the port on the side, so it works a little better ergonomically.I've found it to be very sensitive, as other reviewers have stated. I have to slow down my clicking and make sure it's right over the item I'm specifying. I tend to fly around the screen a lot, clicking here and there, and this doesn't fly to well with this mouse.I thought there might be issues with switching the mouse between my PC and Mac, but all I really have to do is move the USB, and voila! It works. So I haven't run into any compatibility issues.In terms of distance from the computer, I've found I can only go up to five feet away and still use it. Granted, in normal day-to-day use, I'm right there next to the computer, but I thought I'd try it out. Any more than five feet and things just weren't reading for me.One of the biggest problems I have with laser driven mice is their tendency to wig out on reflective surfaces. The solution, of course, is not to use it on a polished surface, or to find an un-laminated mouse pad. However, with the MS mouse, I found I didn't have that problem. I found it worked just find on the desktop without any issues.", "I bought this mouse for my use at work.  After having it for a couple of weeks, I'm very happy with this purchase.  It does have a lower profile than what I'm used to but I found it to be pretty comfortable and I got used to the feel very quickly.I do have a big hang and my hand drags on the table but I've had that happen with almost all mice I've ever had.As some other reviewers have said, the mouse is difficult to pick up.  But, I don't have too much trouble getting it into position.  And, with the way I mouse, I don't have to raise the mouse off the table very often.What kept me from giving it five stars is that it has trouble on my desk at work; I've had to go back to using a mouse pad.  My previous mouse, an optical mouse, worked fine on that surface.", "There are so many wireless mice available that are so much better than the 7000, that I'm embarrassed to even admit I own one. You'll have problems from the beginning with the battery being too small to connect with the terminals. So the thing won't even charge to begin with. I bought a rechargeable energizer battery that at least charged. Even so the mouse was very choppy sliding across my mouse pad, so I bought a 3M laser mouse pad. That helps a bit, but it's still not smooth sledding. I finally tossed it after doing battle for a couple months. I could have gotten a few dollars on eBay but didn't want to risk my top seller status, plus I wouldn't wish this worthless mouse on anyone. I've had nothing but great success with the Microsoft 2.4ghz bluetrack laser mouse. That works flawlessly, and holds the charge for weeks with constant use. This is a great example where the newer model can't hold a candle to the previous version.", "Short and sweet: This is a very good mouse. I like that it's rechargeable, and the ergonomics are very good. The only thing that keeps me from giving this mouse five stars is simply a matter of personal taste: I'm use to another manufacturer's mouse that weighs a bit more. This mouse is lighter, and as a result (for me) is a little less precise. All in all, a great value.", "This mouse looks very modern and it works great.  I have a similar model with the Explorer Mouse, but I like the look of this one better as well as the charging stand.  Comes with a rechargeable battery.  Great mouse for the cheap price!", "I have mixed feelings about this mouse. On one hand it is a pleasure to use. On the other, charging it leaves much to be desired.This is a fairly large mouse, sculpted nicely to fit most peoples' hands. I have large hands and I have found this mouse to be a good fit. It is comfortable to grip, the scroll wheel is smooth and easy to turn, and the buttons are easy to press without being hyper-sensitive. Ergonomics are this mouse's strongest attribute.In use, the mouse is on par with other Microsoft mice I have used. It is accurate. Unlike some of the comments by other reviewers here, I have had no issue with it being too sensitive or too precise. The performance has, in my opinion, been average. This is not a bad thing - Microsoft mice are usually very consistent and this one fits the norm.Where I ran into difficulty with this mouse was in charging it. I read a lot of other reviews on this mouse beforehand so I was prepared for issues with charging. That said, I was still having issues getting the mouse to charge the battery until I cut part of a 3x5 index card, folded it up and crammed it into the battery compartment with the battery. There have been enough other people that have had to do similarly odd things to rule out the possibility of this being an isolated case.The battery can be put into a normal charger, but that defeats the purpose.This is not a bad mouse. It's actually quite good and I would recommend it except for the recharging issue. As a wireless mouse it is fine, but as a recharging mouse it needs a design revisit.", "\"I'm a programmer and spend about 50-80 hours a week at the computer (I run my own business and enjoy my work). I am always trying out new mice and keyboards. I've probably tried 80 or more mice in the last 10 years.Ergonomics:The first thing I noticed about this mouse is that is only uses one battery. The main reason I never use a wireless mouse on a computer that I use heavily is that the weight of two AA batteries can really add to arm strain after many days of moving them around. This mouse uses a rechargeable AAA battery that is very light weight. Even after using this mouse for a while I am impressed with how light it is.The mouse fits my hand well; I have large hands. However, if you keep a lighter grip on a mouse, this mouse might not suit you. The mouse is fairly flat, and I noticed when using this mouse that I do not naturally let my palm sit on the mouse--I grip the mouse with my fingers and keep my palm above the mouse as though there was a small object between the mouse and my hand. This mouse doesn't suit that kind of use very well, but I did get the hang of this mouse and am enjoying using it. Another reviewer mentioned that it's hard to pick up the mouse while holding onto it in the natural position that this mouse affords. That is definitely the case--the right side of the mouse is so sloped and smooth that picking up the mouse to reposition it is difficult.Features:There are two main buttons and the scroll wheel is also a button. In addition, two small buttons are near the thumb area, but they are so small that I didn't notice them until I was counting buttons for this review.The mouse itself is quite sharp looking--the shinny plastic \"\"chrome\"\" trim and the matte black look great. Definitely the sharpest looking mouse to ever grace my desk. There is a charging LED on the top of the mouse that blinks red while charging and sometimes is green during pairing or when it is charged and sitting on the charger.The mouse comes with a charger base that is very thin and subtle. The charger has a power brick, though as power bricks go, it's fairly small. I was initially puzzled by the power brick--why not use the USB port to charge and combine the receiver and the power station into a single unit? However, I guess the need for a power brick is mandated by computers that sleep turning off the power to the USB ports. However, I still think that the power brick and the transmitter could have been a single component. The mouse \"\"system\"\" as it is consists of the mouse, the power brick and cable, the charging base, and the USB receiver: 4 pieces.Also, out of the box it works fine with the various Macs in my office. I am using this mouse on my Mac Pro tower with no configuration changes other than setting the tracking speed and scrolling speed to suit my preferences. The CD indicates that there's some software for both Windows and the Mac OS on it, but I didn't try the software.Range:My office is fairly large and I have a number of Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, and dozens of Wifi networks in range. Even with all the potential interference, I got over 22 feet of range with this mouse--with the receiver behind my desk and me on the other side of the room. It should have plenty of range for normal office or living room scenarios.Some cons:One thing I've never liked about Microsoft mice in the last few years is the lack of tactile feedback on the scroll wheel. This mouse doesn't solve that problem, but the rest of the mouse is so good that I am tempted to keep working with this mouse and see if I can get used to it.I think this mouse is too large to be used as a travel mouse; I use a Logitech Bluetooth cordless with my laptop that is intended for travel and it's significantly smaller than this mouse.Why the use of the USB receiver at all? All of my computers have Bluetooth, or I can easily buy a Bluetooth USB adapter if they do not. I'd rather just use Bluetooth than have specialized USB receivers from device to device. If Microsoft wanted to include a Bluetooth receiver, that would be fine.Finally, the packaging: It's bulky, it contains too much plastic, and it's difficult to figure out how to extract the hardware from the package. This is typical and not significantly different from Logitech or other vendors' packaging, though.Summary:This is a great mouse. It looks good, it feels comfortable to use, and it doesn't suffer some of common drawbacks (limited range, heavy weight) of other wireless mice. It is relatively expensive for a mouse, but I think it's money well spent if you are using your computer for hours on end for business use. The lack of Bluetooth and the various pieces for the \"\"mousing system\"\" do cost the mouse one star.\"", "I think the most important part of my computer is the mouse. As a visual person, a monitor is also a key component; however, a good and comfortable mouse is as critical as well.I've been using Apple's wired mighty mouse for years, and honestly, I must say, it is not the most comfortable mouse in the world. However, when I tried Microsoft's wireless rechargeable laser, I instantly fell in love with it; I felt the difference immediately. I could tell the difference in gripping and feeling. My fingers and wrist feel more relaxed because of this product's ergonomic design.The great part is that it's wireless, and it recharges when I leave it on the recharging dock. I've tried Apple's wireless Bluetooth mouse before, and it was annoying to change battery once a week.Also, this mouse doesn't interfere with any other wireless devices I have, such as cordless phone, wifi router, Bluetooth headset, and cell phones. The sensibility of this mouse is almost too sensitive; I had to reduce the pointer speed on the setting.The downside of this mouse is the price. It's a bit expensive, yet I think it's worth to invest a little for the most important part of your computing. Overall, I use this mouse on my Mac, and it works great without installing any drivers. Good mouse and comfortable computing for a decent price.", "This design is ergonomically UNFIT! There's abnormally hollow inward space where you thumb would normally rest on. As a result it puts more stress on the thumb than it does any good.DEFINITELY HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.", "\"As with all my reviews i review them based on expectations not on actual performance.  Because anyone buying this expecting it to perform like 80 dollar mouse is in for disappointment.  Dont buy a ford and complain it wont handle like a porsche.Pros:Light weightgood size feels great in the handscroll wheel is smooth and precise (no clicking, doesn't bother me tho)External charger is optional.  you can just change batteries manually as i have a separate charger i use for my batteries.Consno hyper scrollingi miss that extra button logitech MX gave me on the thumb restOnly holds 1 AAA battery.  would like to see two to increase run timeI'm very satifised with this mouse for a cheap price.

The battery last a while, moderate bluetooth range!", "Great Mouse - Great Price $17.95, but... we purchased 4 of them and all four the battery were dead.  However, that's to be expected as this is a discontinued item and the stock is old.  We purchased replacement batteries here on Amazon (about $3.50 ea) and they charge perfectly. This is still using the bluetooth technology which makes it very reliable in XP and Win 7.", "I have been using the Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 2.0 on my Mac for years and have been very happy with it, but I think that this one will replace it.  The shape of the unit has been redesigned to make it more comfortable, as your wrist will not be held in a flat orientation, but rather angled in order to provide less stress.  I have noticed that it definitely feels better on my wrist after using it than the old model.The secondary set of buttons has been redesigned and they are now, to me, a bit harder to use, but this might just be a matter of getting used to them.  The position of the buttons doesn't feel quite as nice to me, but I have still easily been able to use the back button without any real problems.  Perhaps some more use will prove that the new configuration is actually better.Microsoft has changed the optical sensors on this version and the tracking of this mouse feels a bit better than the old one.  I tried the mouse on a variety of surfaces and it seemed to have a small problem on a white piece of paper; it was jittery.  It worked perfectly on the bare desk, a mouse pad, brown paper, etc.The software installation was quick and easy.  I put the disc in and ran the installation pkg and it updated my existing Microsoft Mouse software.  The button configuration worked exactly like my old mouse, but it did not copy the sensitivity settings, so I had to reset the sensitivity.  This was not a big deal, as it took about 5 seconds.Overall, I think that the new, more ergonomic, design makes this mouse a worthy upgrade to an already great product.Five stars.", "I had been using a Logitech MX revolution wireless, rechargeable mouse before.  So, those are the two key features for me.  The Microsoft mouse has some great benefits over the Revolution, in my opinion.  First, the entire mouse is WAY lighter.  I weighed them both:  The Revolution is 5.2oz, while the Microsoft is 3.6oz.  When your hand is having to move the mouse around all day, this weight makes a difference.  Also, I really like the flat recharging station.  It is very easy to just place the mouse on the recharging pad and have it rest in the proper place.  The Revolution charging station is vertical, and takes very careful alignment to get it to recharge.In terms of mouse performance and feel, I'd say this is going to be related a lot to personal preference.  How the size of your hand, length of your fingers fit a given mouse can make a big difference.  So, I'd recommend trying out a few before deciding."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06861115992069244, 0.10884199291467667, 0.00014640321023762226, 0.0023197538685053587, 0.02731282263994217, 0.0005232502589933574, 0.0002256164007121697, 0.005554359406232834, 7.391688995994627e-05, 0.10051700472831726, 0.0064797368831932545, 0.10113627463579178, 0.06666706502437592, 0.008885040879249573, 0.09697962552309036, 0.1185867190361023, 0.0008412810857407749, 0.07914790511131287, 0.06358300894498825, 0.008044436573982239, 0.0006285018171183765, 0.10310190171003342, 0.022017264738678932, 0.00977496150881052]]}
