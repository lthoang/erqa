This Does NOTHING at all for my Gout. Couldn't even tell I had tried anything. Waste of money. Wish it had worked, but I should have known it couldn't be that easy to get rid of even a little of the pain. I've tried 2 other formulas of this brand for sinus allergies and they did nothing either so I won't try anything in this brand again.", "\"With Ammonium Phosphoricum, Belladonna, Colchicum Autumnale, Formicum Acidum, Fraxinus Excelsior, Ledum Palustre, Natrum Carbonicum, Nux Vomica, Urtica Urens and \"\"Bio-Energetically Enhanced&trade;, taste-free, pure water base\"\" as its list of ingredients, I was hesitant to even try it. Personally, I thought the ingredients were just made-up to sound better than they were. After a little research, I found that most of these show up on homeopathic sites with blurbs about effectiveness but I haven't found origins or clinical testing results or even precautions. What I didn't see on the packaging was what levels of these ingredients are in this mixture.I decided to try it with only mild gout symptoms (I wasn't going to push a full blown bout - that would be insensible). With spraying as the mode of dispensation, I wasn't sure that it would get to where it was needed. After a full day of dosing, my symptoms were alleviated. I have not concluded yet whether that was due to being active that day or natural progression or the spray. I did have the sense that I have been using snake oil.So, I remain unconvinced. I will try this again if I have a full flare-up and report back to update this review. I'm all about using natural remedies for my symptoms, like for sleeplessness, so if this works in the long-run, I will let people know.\"", "This product works very fast and is effective. In conjunction with prescribed medication from my doctor, black cherry juice, TONS of water, and epsom salt baths, this spray helped my symptoms. I would definitely purchase again.", "I was so excited to get this product.  My husband has gout attacks quite often.  At the first sign he took this product and it did not seem to do anything.  Over the course of a few weeks we repeated this action, hoping for a different outcome, but it did not seem to do anything for him, so I am a bit disappointed.", "I have an adult son who has had problems with gout (he has had it since fairly young and while some dietary things exist it seems to be more of a general predisposition for him).  This has provided some gentle relief from symptoms along with getting acupuncture.", "This is a difficult product to properly gauge as the best way to test it would be to utilize the recommended 3 - 6 doses per day while in the midst of a full-on gout attack.  What I can say is that there are not many products of this type - an all natural homeopathic oral spray to treat gout related symptoms (joint redness/swelling/inflammation on the feet or toes). Application usage is very simple - a quick spritz of the (tasteless) liquid into your mouth as needed.  While I don't see this replacing prescription meds for acute sufferers or even Advil, for those with more minor conditions - the product is priced reasonably enough to give it a proper try (particularly for those keen on embracing natural, homeopathic options).", "Let me be blunt: While I am generally open to both vitamin and herbal therapies for various physical ailments, I think homeopathy is a crock in spite of the fact that I have friends who swear by it.  However, in the spirit of inquiry and fairness I decided to give this formula a try.  I have been religious about using it in the manner described on the box.  The result?  A gout flare-up.  So no, this didn't work for me.Will it work for you?  I don't know.  What I do know is that the dilutions in this formula are so minor as to leave not a single molecule of the original substance in the water.  To simplify, if you dropped a sugar cube in a swimming pool you'd have a stronger solution than you'll find in this formula.I'm all for alternative healing methods, but this isn't one I'd choose.  Sorry if I sound cranky, but my toe hurts."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.14331544935703278, 0.15017394721508026, 0.13869161903858185, 0.13518370687961578, 0.1311531811952591, 0.14323268830776215, 0.1582493782043457]]}
