And im mad because it looked like a really interesting story.", "\"Alone in the Dark follows Edward, an amnesiac followed possessed by a demonic entity that is ordered to follow the \"\"Path of Light\"\" in order to stop the demon from consuming New York City. Sounds pretty decent, doesn't it?AitD struggles pretty much from the getgo with painful controls, a camera system that is great for filming movies, but deplorable for trying to play a game, and an inventory system that, while inventive and original, tries so hard that it forgets what it was trying to do in the first place. Control of the character is difficult enough without straying into combat, which is forced on you repeatedly. And while you're strong enough to ignore bone deep wounds and cuts and bruises, you can't swing a flaming club around faster than a 4 year old trying to bat in the majors.The inventory controls suffer greatly as well, as its easy to pull stuff out and put it back, but it doesn't pause the game to stop the monsters from chewing half your face off. Also, there's no \"\"holster\"\" button, a standard staple from FPS time immemorial. So you can end up shooting half a clip while struggling to find the control to pull out your molotov to fight the monster that currently killing you.Its a sad letdown to something that's otherwise rather decent. The storyline starts off well and progress at a decent pace. The graphics are good even by today's standards, and the voice actors actually know what they're doing, which seems to be a rarity in today's dubbing.\"", "\"One of the most disappointing titles of 08 is Alone in the Dark.Pros:- good visuals (but you often won't be able to appreciate them due to a crazy camera)- good effects (fire and electrical)- good soundtrack- good (looking) inventory (it's only good conceptually though, NOT good in practice)- a nice rebuild-a-world concept. Eden did this incredibly well with Test Drive Unlimited. I suggest you buy that game instead.Cons:- EVERYTHING ELSE- the camera/view/perspective is insane and simply uncontrollable. This game has a 1st person/3rd person/3rd person (forced) perspective. It switches back and forth between these perspectives every 5 seconds against your will (you have no choice), disorienting you, and when the perspective changes the control layout also changes which is even further disorienting. This means that if you are looking around in 1st person (with right thumbstick - like every other game in the world) and the game sudden changes to 3rd person (because they think it's a neat cinematic gimmick), that right thumbstick no longer functions as it did before. In combat, it gets worse. that same thumbstick changes yet again depending on the weapon. Wow, that, is, nuts.- first person view is too slow- controls are insane and uncontrollable. As described above, they keep changing and you have to unlearn everything you just learned and relearn what the h*ll everything does based on what perspective you are in and what the situation is. That's the problem. Your brain will still be using the layout you were able to use 2 seconds ago, because that's natural, intuitive and the way most good games work. h*ll, even really bad games have consistent controls.- there is NO option for the gamer to map the controller as in other games. If they'd put the controls in the gamer's hands, maybe this would have been a 2 or a 3.- even if you master the constantly changing controls, they are still slow, clunky and unresponsive. Doing things like jumping and just trying to pick something up can be goofy.- While the inventory system is interesting and has a professional looking interface, it functions like everything else in this game, with poor unintuitive controls. Beyond that, the inventory doesn't pause the action, so you'll get your butt kicked in combat trying to figure out what to do with the inventory...nice- the use \"\"fire to kill everything\"\" gimmick is overused and seems a bit silly. Fire isn't ubiquitous in real life.- dialog not really inspired- story not really engaging- don't really care about the characters- driving is horrid. I won't even talk about it.- combat is tedious, long, difficult and silly using the clunky controls. and again, UNINTUITIVE and utterly inconsistent.- All of the above means POOR GAME TESTING. Somebody, somewhere at some point must have mentioned the camera and controls. My guess is that somebody did, they weren't the boss, and the boss never played the game.Usually with bad games, you have things like bad AI which runs right at you, low-rez textures, bugs, poor collision detection, stuff like that. These are hallmarks of low budgets, rushed titles, noob programmers, etc...Alone in the Dark is very bad is UNUSUAL ways. Like they had a big budget, decent developers, and had good tools in their hands, but still managed to create a monstrosity. That crazy show \"\"Cop Rock\"\" comes to mind. A complete disaster.\"", "I've played some really bad games in the past, but I have to admit that AITD has jumped up into the top 5.GAMPLAY:  Absolutely horrid.GRAPHICS: Actually, pretty good.SOUND:  There's sound in this game other than grunts?Okay so, hands-down the absolute worst controls in any game -- ever! The first five minutes of this game alone, will have you wanting to throw your controller across the room! Just wait until you have to fight an enemy. Moving you character is such a chore that any hopes of enjoyment are soon done away with.In short, I simply can not understand how a game that has been delayed as many times as this, can still be this bad.TRUST ME! Save your money!", "\"Are you one of those people that enjoys pain and self torture?  Does the idea of poking yourself in the eye with a sharp object sound pleasurable to you?  Then look no further - this game is for you!  I'm actually very disappointed in myself.  I typically read multiple reviews prior to buying a game and, for the most part, I am influenced on whether or not to spend any money on it based on those reviews.  However, for whatever reason, I let my curiousity get the best of me this time.  I ignored the scathing reviews and actually let the one or two decent reviews talk me into buying this farce of a game.  How diasppointed was I?  Well, I spent $3.99 + shipping, so about $7.00 total.  That's a complete meal at Taco Bell.  I'd have gotten 1,000 times more enjoyment out of some Taco Bell tacos than I did with this piece of crap.  It's really like I spent $7.00 for someone to kick me in the sack...hard.Why am I making this game sound so terrible?  Because it's terrible.  Unplayable.  I can't remember the last time I started playing a game and was already yelling at my TV in frustration less than 10 minutes in.  Oh wait, yes I can, it was the last time I tried to play this POS.  If this game has any redeeming quality whatsoever, it's that it looks good.  The graphics are clean and well done.  The good points end there.  Regardless of how good it looks, you can't enjoy it because you'll be too frustrated trying to control the idiot protagonist.  I read a review on this game that described the controls as being similar to a tank with a broken engine.  That is spot on.  Just trying to move the jerk so you can focus on a specific point is like pulling teeth.  Trying to actually platform is even more of a joke.  Sometimes, the B button will be jump.  Other times it will be drop down.  I guess it's whatever the game decides at any given time.  And combat?  YIKES.  You \"\"focus\"\" on an enemy and \"\"swing\"\" the right stick to hit enemies with whatever object you can find.  After 50 or so shots to the head with a chair, the enemy will drop...for a few seconds...and get right back up unless you drag the limp body over some fire to fully kill it.  Sound stupid?  It is.  Very.  The sound of the game is also lame.  The voice acting is hilariously bad.  Like something out of a C movie.  Not a B movie, a C movie.So let's see...it controls like crap, sounds like crap, has a convoluted story that I never got into because the game is so crappy that I couldn't bare to continue past the first 45 minutes, and well, it's just crap.  To anyone that claims to have played all the way through this game and considers it a \"\"hidden gem\"\" is EASILY entertained, has an unnatural patience level and has likely never played a truly decent game.  Otherwise, I can really think of no reason anyone would derive any type of pleasure from this title.  The developers of this game should be embarrassed to have been a part of this POS.  I'm actually embarrassed to have it on my shelf.  I tried to give it to my neighbor - for free - and I got a response of, \"\"No thanks, dude.\"\"  He must've read the reviews that I ignored.This game is easily in the top 5 worst games I've ever played in my life, and that's after only playing 45 minutes of it.  I refuse to give this farce any more of my time.  If you're considering buying this game, don't.  You've been warned.Overall: 1/5 - I'd TOTALLY give it a 0/5 if possible.\"", "\"Alone in the Dark was the first game I ever pre-ordered. I was extremely excited to play another \"\"Resident Evil\"\" style game with next gen physics, graphics and gameplay... I should have waited.Alone in the Dark starts with a bang, introducing some very impressive cutscene work and EXCELLENT graphics and music. The voice acting is only decent, but the script makes up for it... Anyhow, once the game starts, things take an abrupt turn for the worse. My first thoughts were, \"\"What the heck? This thing wasn't even made for Xbox!\"\" The controls are simply awful, the fighting is very awkward, and the objectives get repetitive. The last time I experienced a game this annoying was \"\"Advanced Warfighter\"\" on the PS2.Don't buy this game!RECOMMENDED TITLES FOR XBOX 360Gears of WarDeadrisingTurokPreyThe Orange BoxBEST GAME OF ALL TIMEResident Evil 4[...]\"", "\"I purchased Alone in the Dark at the same time I bought Silent Hill: Homecoming.  I'm a sucker for survival horror, and both games came highly recommended.  The difference between the two is quite illuminating.There has been a trend recently to reverse the gamist influence of tabletop role-playing games on their video game counterparts.  Consoles don't lend themselves well to complex rules systems and designers find their beautifully rendered enemies disrupted by floating hit point numbers over their heads.  In response, Alone in the Dark goes full simulationist - forget the rules, this is all about horror!And so Alone in the Dark, like Silent Hill, starts out in media res. You learn to play as you go by ferociously clicking buttons to blink your eyes so you can see straight.  You play an amnesiac anti-hero with a secret connection to a certain stone held by a certain priest.  A bald villain, named Crowley (yet another mystical foe named after Aleister Crowley, the occultist), marches you to your doom until he is disrupted by something even scarier: extradimensional tears in the fabric of reality.Thing is, extradimensional tears aren't all that scary.  The entity that is in charge enjoys possessing hot chicks and growling in a deep voice, instantly rendering the villain rather mundane. Those looking for the Cthulhu Mythos-inspired connection that suffused the original Alone in the Dark will find the chatty archnemesis lacking.What Alone in the Dark does very well is completely conceal the rules from the player.  Our hero can only carry so many items in his jacket - no unlimited, unrealistic inventory here!  He can swing weapons or even light them on fire, and the fire mechanics allow him to do everything from blast explosive bottles out of the air to pouring flammable liquid on his bullets so they shoot fire.  Realistic, huh?There are no hit points, no health meters, and not much in the way of rules.  What Alone in the Dark lacks in gamist structure it makes up for in narrativist railroading, with a capital R.Alone in the Dark is hellbent on telling a story, and the developers just happen to drag the player along for the ride.  It even has a function to allow you to skip any scene, with a brief montage at the beginning of each replay to describe what happened \"\"previously, in Alone in the Dark...\"\" I played a car chase sequence fifty times before I gave up. I ran around with a flashlight trying to make some black goo not eat me (repeatedly watching the starting sequence of a sewer worker swearing effusively before being eaten) thirty times before I gave up. I teetered inside a precariously balanced bus on the edge of the cliff dozens of times before the game crashed.And so we have Alone in the Dark's problem - if you want to make a game all about story, it better be a good story.  Alone in the Dark provides absolutely no guidance as to what to do next.  You are guaranteed to die over and over until you figure it out, which renders any interesting cut scene or curious camera angle meaningless after the fifth time.  The game is a buggy mess too.  It crashes constantly; at one point, a villain just stood there and let me whack at him to no effect. Maybe he felt bad for me.Alone in the Dark tries hard, but like an action blockbuster, it has no interesting story to tell.  With stereotypical villains, enemies that aren't scary, frustrating camera angles, and a railroading plot that will have you tearing your hair out, Alone in the Dark will leave players alone in the dark.\"", "\"I've been reviewing games for Amazon since 1999. I've seen the worst of games...Daikatana, most especially. Now, after many moons have passed, I have come across one of the worst, if not, the buggiest, most annoying piece of program I have ever encountered in my life. Alone in the Dark is a major disaster, from it's storyline, dialogue, annoying voice acting, frustrating controls, unforgiving checkpoints, and the most buggiest collision detection EVER! The only PLUS in this game are the graphics but that's about it. So I'll keep my review straight and to the point:GRAPHICS: Excellent. No complaintsCONTROLS: Main character moves like a tank with a bad engine. Controls are completely unresponsive. Some buttons do not function as stated. For example, you press A to turn off a flashlight. If you're holding a gun in one hand and holding a flashlight on the other, you can't press A to turn it off. You have to press the gamepad down, open your virtual jacket and then unequip from there. HOW TEDIOUS CAN THIS GET??? Another example: you're standing next to an object your wish to pick-up, an \"\"pick-up object icon\"\" appears telling you to press A. To pick up an object, press A. The problem with this is that turning off the flashlight you need to press A as well. So if you're holding a flashlight and you need to turn off it off (it has limited battery life by the way), you'll have to move away from the pickable object so you can turn off the flashlight.Here's another example again: You have a zombie attacking you, controls say you have to double click the left analog stick to do a quick turn. If you're holding a gun or a melee weapon, quick turn won't work, but then sometimes it does!!!And here's another example: Driving a car is like driving a bar of soap on a smooth glass. A slight turn on the stick will spin your car uncontrollably. There's an action sequence in this game that requires some driving. I will warn you now, prepare to do this about 200 to 500 times because you will fail.BUGGY ACTION SEQUENCE: There's an action sequence on Episode 2 where you have to escape an earthquake. The entire driving sequence requires you to get away from the earthquake before ti swallows your car. Unfortunately, the car is just completely unresponsive. Second, there's a jump that you have to make before the entire road cracks open. Sometimes you'll make the jump sometimes you won't. What's weird is that once your car flies over the cracked road, the game will turn into a full motion video showing your car making the jump. But once your car lands, somehow the game randomly decides whether the earthquake catches the tail end of your car thus killing you instantly or by some algorithmic calculation, you do make it. But that's just half of the problem because this action sequence will continue for the next 10 minutes and if you fail halfway or even on the last part of this sequence, the game will throw you back to beginning of the sequence. TOTALLY UNFORGIVING CHECKPOINTS. By the way, you can't skip the full motion videos which means you'll be forced to watch cheesy FMVs over and over again everytime you fail an action sequence.How about weapons you ask? Forget about using guns. Guns are completely ineffective against zombies (which you will be battling the entire game). So if ever you decide to collect ammo, well...it's pretty much useless and waste of space. Zombies can only be killed by fire. If you do have to use your gun to kill zombies, you'll have to find gasoline or any flammable liquid, combine it with your bullets, load your gun with said \"\"gasoline dipped\"\" bullets and then shoot the zombies. But wait, you can't just shoot them anywhere. Zombies have this glowing yellow areas of their body that's vulnerable to fire. So on top of mixing and matching items to make fire, you'll have to be a sharpshooter to hit the zombies where it hurts. Otherwise, you'll just be wasting time and ammo.I think I've said enough. This game is the worst ever for 2008. Do not waste your money on this. Believe me, when I read the poor reviews, I told myself \"\"Nah, I don't believe these reviews, I will buy it and try it myself.\"\" So now, I am $60.00 poorer, and my blood pressure just skyrocketed after playing this game. Avoid this game. Stick to the DOS version of Alone in the Dark.\"", "\"After seeing a few demos and seeing the price for the game I thought it was about time to get my first alone in the dark game, and sadly after playing this it will be definitely my final AOITD game too.  The graphics and background as well as animated effects of the game worlds dynamics are astounding so I give kudos to the makers on that part but sadly the horrific camera and movement controls made what could have been a enjoyable game more of a annoying mistake.  There is really no camera control unless you go into first person view which in itself is sometimes problematic especially during fights also when you have to move the motion controls leave a lot to be desired as well as sometimes loosing your sense of direction  in some areas.  The voice cast that were picked for this game also leave a lot to be desired as the actor who did the voice for Edward seemed to apathetic in his roles and it just seemed his acting ability in this game was sub-par as well I won't say he's the worse I ever heard but he definitely isn't the best in this game either as some of the small part character voice cast seemed to do a better job than him.  I don't want to give to much away but I'm sure many people have seen or played the game enough to have heard about the ambiguous ending after the game that left many people like myself wondering \"\"What was the point of the game in the first place\"\".  So is the game remotely worth getting?,  I was able to get the game for $5.00 dollars which is a decent enough price but for my personal point of view I think even $5.00 dollars was too much for this game...\"", "\"The Good: Amazing visuals, story, neat gameplay ideas, very creepyThe Bad: Bad physics, stiff sluggish controls, bad combat, driving shouldn't be annoying, some puzzles are badly set upI was so excited for Alone in the Dark for such a long time that I never thought it would be an (almost) bad game. I don't want to rag on this game since the developers did try really hard, so as a courtesy I'm going to start with the positives. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals; they are amazing. The graphics have high res textures, amazing lighting effects, creepy fog, and it's all very dark and surreal. You'll be playing as John Carnby who is trying to find out the secrets of Central Park while trying to stop Lucifer from taking over the world through \"\"The Path of Light\"\".In the beginning of the game everything is very cinematic and pretty fun. The game walks you through the \"\"mixing system\"\" where you look in your jacket and mix tons of things together at your will. If you want a molatov cocktail stick a handkerchief in a glass or plastic bottle, light it with a lighter and BOOM! Hey you want it to stick to solve a puzzle? Add some sticky tape and your good to go. Need to light your way through a dark tunnel but need it landed in one precise area without it bouncing? Add some tape to that, or you just take an explosive bottle and shoot it in mid-air...don't worry the John keeps track of the bottle in slow motion it's just your job to time the shot.There are also environmental weapons such as setting 4x4s on fire and lighting enemies up with them, use them to light your path, take fire extinguishers to put out fire, or you can use them as battering rams to take down doors. While the combination system is really fun it does have it's limits, but we'll get to the down sides later. The next thing you'll come across will be the combat and there are more downs than ups too this. The one good part is you can use anything at your disposal. While you can only kill the demons (they are pretty damn creepy) with fire there are multiple ways to do this. Have a health spray, or any type or aerosol? Use your lighter for a mini flamethrower.Another great aspect of the game is everything is seen visually. There are no meters or bars anywhere, so your health is indicated by wounds on John's body. Bleed too much and you get a timer to find some bandages fast. There are also car scenes, and Central Park is kind of a much Grand Theft Auto type map where you can get in and out of random cars to kill \"\"evil roots\"\" which are a huge pain in the you know what to find, but more on that later. What's really cool is that if there are no keys you can hotwire the car to start it by matching colored wires, so this gives the game a more of a \"\"I gotta hurry and get the hell out of here\"\" type feeling. While these are the main elements of the game there are just way too many down sides.The physics in the game are busted so everything is either really floaty, really heavy, or just plain wonky looking. Nothing really moves around right in the game and this really sucks since a lot of the game is built around physics. When it comes to combat the game just wants to hate you. While there are very little supplies in the game to begin with it's so hard to kill 8 demons when you only have one spray can. While you can only kill with fire is really dumb since you have a gun, but it won't kill them unless you poor gasoline on the bullets. I found this really stupid and when you try to kill the evil roots near the end of the game you will go mad trying to use the little supplies you have for the root, yet trying to fend off the demons.The controls are just really wonky and don't really work. In third person you can only move with the left stick and you swing things around with the right, but the movement is just really limited. This really sucks when an enemy is behind you and you have to fiddle with the left stick to get John to turn around. The driving is also another pain since the physics really suck. You'll stuck on the slightest slope or little rock and your car will go flying. Demons can come rip you or of your car...or rip the car off you and it's really hard to shake them off. Thanks to the crappy physics you just slightly bump something they go flying off yet they can jump 400 feet. The controls just feel stiff and sluggish and they aren't very responsive sometimes, so this makes everything overall harder than it should be. At least the last positive is the voice acting is good, the story is great, and the DVD type skip feature really helps. I can't recommend this game unless you feel like struggling through this annoying game. It's worth playing for the visuals, story, and great gameplay ideas, but you'll struggle more than smile.\"", "I bought this because I like scary mystery games. Its a good game to add to the collection. Cant beat the price.", "I guess I've played worse flash computer games and maybe a couple old nes and super nes games that sucked more, but this was just a broken piece of trash. There have been so many game projects with great potential that have just been scrapped, and yet this actually made it to release... It even knows it sucks as you can skip any level you want...It's just garbage. Even the parts that seemed cool, were ruined by some glitch or another and it is just BROKEN.", "I picked this game up a few monts ago when I had some spare money, and I most say I was pleasently suprised with it. I had heard a lot of bad things about it and was a little worried after I bought that it might be poor. Its basically a survival horror game with a fairly heavy gunplay feature thrown it with it. The game will frustrate you a lot, there are a lot of parts where you seem to be set up to fail multiple times before you figure out a specific pattern to use. With that said this is no COD4, Halo 3, or Bioshock, but it still brings much to the table that we have not seen in a while. This game is now $40, which is resonable if you have that much money on you.Graphics 9.0 ( Top notch graphics )Audio 6.5 ( You only hear enemies most of the time )Achievements 8.5 ( easy 750-1000 )Controls 7.0 ( Wasnt that bad to me )Camera 6.5 ( Can be irritating at times )Overall 8.5-9.0", "Thats all this game disc is good for.Making a good coaster for your soft drinks and other sorts of beverages.If youre thinking about buying this game to play it and enjoy it...dont.", "This game is very ambitious and stunning to look at; The locations and scenarios are impressive, but to me the game fails to deliver on the fun factor. I found myself either bored or frustrated half the time, and  didn't really find it scary either. I have considered the possibility that after so many years of console gaming, it is harder to find something fresh and something that really grabs me. The first person control works the best, but the 3rd person is somewhat of a nightmare, esp in the era of 'next-gen'. Hand to hand combat is awkward, and while this game is very beautiful to look at, it just wasn't enjoyable. In many ways it reminded me of Condemned 2, which was also very hit and miss; But that's just me. It should also be noted that I have little to no tolerance for a game that doesn't control well. Decent story and voice acting, but the visuals are the best thing this game has going for it. Playable, but a mixed experience.", "\"Most people attribute the start of the Survival Horror genre to Resident Evil.  While you can trace the birth of Survival Horror back far, far before that game (to Sweet Home or, if you want to stretch it, to Haunted House in 1981), modern Survival Horror games were firmly established by the first Alone in the Dark.  Since that first game, though, the series has been an up and down roller coaster that never seemed to be able to outmatch some of the better known and more famous franchises like Resident Evil or Silent Hill.So, when Eden Games started to work on reinventing the franchise, I was cautiously optimistic.  A lot of the ideas and concepts they spoke of seemed like great ideas, and they seemed to be trying to Do Something Different.  Unfortunately, the sum is not greater than its parts and Alone in the Dark, while reaching for the stars, can't stay afloat.Things begin appropriately apocalyptic.  Edward Carnby awakens in some hotel with some bad men arguing about cryptic shenanigans.  Carnby, no longer useful, is led up to the roof to be executed but before that can happen, bad juju hits the fan as a \"\"scar\"\" tears through the building.  From here, this first episode really picks up as you're trying to escape the building alive.Here is where the goodness lies.  Alone in the Dark has a great opening that's appropriately cinematic but in such a way that only games can do.  The building starts to fall apart, you have to run and jump your way to safety, climb along the outside of the building while debris tumbles and while watching cars below you explode.  You learn how Eden Games created some appropriately realistic fire for the game as you watch it spread and have to put it out or use it as a weapon.  You'll see things happen to the various rooms you're in that will make you want to believe you're watching a cinematic, not playing through a game.  It's very cool.And then you try to move.Movement is the worst part of the game.  It's all controlled with one stick which makes actually moving feel as if you're controlling a drunk, disobedient person.  Once you get a melee weapon in your hand, you'll see another problem: using the right analog stick to attack.  You'll have to swing it one direction, then another just to attack.  Unfortunately it's sluggish, as is the animation, resulting in you taking more damage than you should need to.  Fighting monsters becomes a chore, one you'll grow to hate because as the game progresses, you'll learn that basically all monsters can only die via fire.  So, grab that chair, light it on fire and swing away...hoping you hurt it more than it hurts you.  Similarily, gun fights are also not terrific as you have to pop into first person whenever you want to shoot someone.  No lock and pop here.Likewise, if walking around makes you feel like a drunk, driving is a good approximation of drunk driving, I believe.  The controls are incredibly loose and in the first driving portion of the game, loose controls isn't a good idea.  What should be an exciting escape sequence that involves the ground behind you exploding, tears appearing across the streets, buildings collapsing, fire, death explosions, cats and dogs sleeping together turns into frustration as you'll probably find yourself repeating the episode.  Over. And Over.  From the beginning.  It loses its fun and becomes a chore.Towards the end of the game, the game pulls a Zelda: Wind Waker moment and has you hunting down certain things and destroying them in an effort, one has to assume, to artificially lengthen the game.  If there's one thing that Alone in the Dark does exceptionally well, it's the pacing.  When you hit this moment it's like running smack dab into a brick wall.  It's sad.There's a lot going for Alone in the Dark, don't get me wrong.  The inventory system is a cool innovation.  The whole episodic \"\"TV show/DVD\"\" feel is perfect, with DVD-style menus complemented by the ability to switch to any episode you like.  The graphics are pretty decent, as is the engine it's running on.  Some cool, small features, like the ability to blink your eyes is very effective during some sequences.  And the pacing--for the most part--is perfect; it can really get your adrenaline going...until you're forced to repeat the same thing over and over again.I really wanted to like Alone in the Dark.  I didn't honestly think that Eden Games would elevate the game to the front of the pack, but there was enough little things and innovations that I thought maybe it'd be a good game.  When I played it, I was amazed.  Eden Games wanted no less than to shoot for the moon and make the most ambitious Survival Horror game yet.  Unfortunately, reality is sometimes like gravity and unfortunately Alone in the Dark isn't the masterpiece I, and Atari, I'm sure, was hoping for.  Definitely give it a rent, but I'd hold off on purchasing it.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10656160861253738, 0.034574273973703384, 0.04783068597316742, 0.04902484267950058, 0.08710075169801712, 0.10492335259914398, 0.08201948553323746, 0.0029739770106971264, 0.014984501525759697, 0.0014310093829408288, 0.08459892123937607, 0.05926540493965149, 0.04227776452898979, 0.09571897983551025, 0.05948234722018242, 0.12723207473754883]]}
