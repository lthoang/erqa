In addition the lack of variation between kart skills is somewhat of a disappointment. However, the totally unique maps and stunning settings make this game an eye pleaser. Test your skills against your competitors, friend and foe and it makes for a really great time. This game paired with a Wii driving wheel is endless fun!", "I honestly can't say anything bad about Mario Kart. It is just so fun and I can honestly even keep playing it for awhile by myself. Suitable for all ages and family friendly. I love it", "\"Mario Kart Wii does a lot of things right. There are lot of reasons that one might say to himself, \"\"This is the best kart racing game ever.\"\" And given its endless list of things you can do, it may well be. I wouldn't know as I haven't played them all. But when you look closer at Mario Kart Wii, there are a few glaring problems with the game.The Good:All of these tracks are good. There are 32 that I've encountered. Many have the sorts of alternate routes we've come to love and there are plenty of places to do little tricks for speed boosts. Consequently, driving the karts are pretty enjoyable. The great design of these tracks make the Time Trial mode all the better. Half of the tracks are from older Mario Kart games, which is good for two reasons: 1) Nostalgia is good. 2) You can play your favorite old school SMK tracks online now. Neat.It has a pretty vibrant online mode. It's been out for two or three years now, but people never seem to tire of Mario Kart. It's awesome. It should be said that many folks who play this are extremely good, so veteran kart racers  will find no shortage of competition.There two ways you can turn (or drift, as the game calls it). The automatic method is easy and for the most part makes braking unnecessary. The manual method plays like a cross between the original Super Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing for N64. You get a little \"\"reward\"\" in the form of a speed boost for using it on curves. This option is good because it adds even more depth to a game that's already immersed with it.Speaking of Diddy Kong, by the way: He's here once you unlock him. There are lot of unlockable characters and vehicles in this game.I could go on an on, but there's so much ramble about in the game's favor.The Bad:When you're in groups with other people playing online, there is no form of communication at all. I didn't expect anything in the way of voice chat (after all, it is Nintendo we're talking about), but a something akin to a system of predetermined emotes would have went a long way in making the online mode feel like you're playing with human beings.I think that it would have been so much better if Mario Kart Wii had focused more on racing and less on the powerups. This is almost inexcusable: When I'm winning, the Blue Turtle shell of death will come. And when I'm losing, I can rest assured that sixteen million Mushrooms will come my way and get me back in the race. This game actually punishes you for being good at it. It would have been so much better if items like Bullet Bill and the Shell were just rare and didn't spawn in relation to your position.I compared the manual drift to DKR's, earlier. Mario Kart Wii would have been PERFECT if it had just taken a few more cues from that game or even earlier Mario Karts. It's good for everything that it has, but the actual racing experience is somewhat lacking due to all of the powerups.\"", "The kids love this game and we get to race each other.  This is a great game on family night.", "What a great game!  I can't stop playing it!  My girlfiend loves it too!  It was actually a gift to her, but I borrow it quite a bit!  I can only play it with the classic control, I really hate the Wii motion!  I think that is a terrible way to play the game myself and just can't get into the game at all by moving my arms all around the whole time!  What a nuisance!  This game is just like the Game Cube Mario Kart... If you like the Game Cube version, you will love this one!  I originally thought the game cube one was crazy, but now when I play the original SNES one it is like watching a move in slow motion.I actually couldn't imagine anyone even reading a review of this game!  You have got to know it is a great game!  And that is probably why it is still $40 for a brand new copy!", "More copy and paste from Nintendo. This ip needs to be shelved for a while until Nintendo knows where they want the series to go.", "This game is for all ages. Young and old. You can play this game for hours, and easily lose track of time. What I like best about this is that you can play on the classic tracks from snes and the n64. PLUS, you can play with others online.You don't have to buy the wii wheel to experience the awesomeness of mario kart wii. You can use your wii remote or the remote + nunchuck. I personally like to use the remote + nunchuck combination. Easy to maneuver and the buttons right there without trying to find where they are!", "I like the characters because they look awesome and are so cool! My favorite part of the game are the tracks. You can also earn different trophies and unlock lots of characters.", "Mario Kart Wii is a clutch game for everyone. It takes you back to the Nintendo 64 with race tracks from the original Mario Kart. With the add on steering wheel, you feel as if your driving a real car. The graphics aren't the best in this game, but besides that its a great. Its a fast story mode so try to pace yourself when playing it. I highly recommend this product to people who enjoy Nintendo games.", "With Nintendo winding down on the Wii and putting its emphasis on the Wii U, many gamers are eager to see what Nintendo is going to develop. But for games for the Nintendo Wii, they still are playable on the new system. But there are games that are still defiant and driven in the way that the original Wii was designed for. That is definitely the case with Mario Kart Wii. It really is one of those games that continued to expand on a racing franchise that has gotten better with time. The game series had definitely taken a new direction when it came out for the Nintendo DS before, and it delivered with online gameplay, and battling against others through the internet. Mario Kart Wii definitely expanded that, and it definitely has shown it for the Nintendo Wii that has made it definitively worth while.Mario Kart Wii for the Nintendo Wii, which is also playable on the Nintendo Wii U, where you will race your way through over 30 different races from Mario Kart past and present from the driven karts, as well as motorcycles, all trying to make your way to get the Mushroom Cup, Star Cup, and finish the top of the class. You can play with your favorites from Mario and Yoshi, to Bowser, and Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy and King Boo from Luigi's Mansion. The gameplay is definitely challenging, and definitely worth its while with great courses like the kooky Coconut Mall, the Bomb-omb kart filled, traffic blocked Moonlit Highway, and classic courses like Bowser Castle from Mario Kart 64, and Peach's Garden from Mario Kart DS. The gameplay is definitely fun, where you can play against others online through the net, internationally by the Wii Wi-Fi connection, which works seamlessly. The control for the game handles well from each of the courses, with the Wii-mote & Nunchuck controls, the Nintendo Gamecube controller (for original Nintendo Wii gamers only,) the Wii Classic Controller, and the Wii-mote with the steering wheel attachment, that originally came with Mario Kart Wii, but you can buy seperately.All in all, if you have just bought a Nintendo Wii U, and you would like some of the classic games for the Nintendo Wii library, this is definitely one definitive game to start. What has made Mario Kart Wii a great title, is the fun and outrageous excitement that you get, racing your way to Lakitu's checkered flag. I absolutely have loved this game from the beginning when it came out in 2008, and still gets my gears going for fun. If you are looking for controls with the Nintendo Wii U, only the Wii classic controller and the Wii-mote & nunchuck will do for this game, but it still is one game that is worth the money. Until, Nintendo comes out with one for the Wii U, this definitely will tide racers over in the meantime. I definitely recommend this game.Graphics: ASound: AControl: B- for Wii Steering Wheel, B+ for Wii-mote & Nunchuck, A- for Wii Classic Controller, A- for Gamecube ControllerFun & Enjoyment: A- for solo player; A for multiplayerOverall: A-", "My six year old grand kid loves this game easy to play and hours of fun and laughter. well worth the price. Get the steer wheel for this", "This game is really good! The tracks are way better than the previous titles and there's so many characters to choose from! The graphics look good and the game flows perfectly.", "If you are like me, you have played every Mario Kart game from SNES version to the Wii version. This one is my favorite because they keep getting better. Adding the steering wheel to the game really adds to the fun factor but you can play this without the steering wheel or you can use a non-motion controllers as well (such as a GameCube controller or classic Wii controller).Gameplay: Race around with up to 4 players in grand pri mode with solo or team races, or battle it out in battle mode with loads of options including traditionally balloon battle, coin battle, king of the hill (keep the star as long as possible) and a few other modes. Single player mode adds time trial to mix and if you are online, you can race against a ghost of another player's fastest time. There are more racing levels than ever before. You get 16 retro courses from previous Mario Kart games and 16 new courses. Loads of characters to choose from and you can un-lock a hand full of extra characters by accomplishing certain tasks.Graphics: typical Wii and Mario fashion.Sound: again, same as tradition Mario Kart fashion.Replayability: I find myself playing single player mode a lot but the real treat is when I have family over to hash it out in 4 player mode. It's worth picking up 4 racing wheels for this game. You can get some cheap combo packs but I wouldn't recommend buying them at Gamestop since 1 will cost you as much as 2 on Amazon.If you like the Mario Kart games, you won't be disappointed with this one.", "For those of you looking to purchase Mario Kart Wii for the online gaming portion, you will be soon out of luck as Nintendo will shut down its servers for this purpose. Just a friendly warning to consumers who are not aware of this fact. Yes, Mario Kart Wii is a fun game. But the online play is the charm of this game. I must admit that I really enjoyed the chaotic competition that this game offered. This game relied on finger dexterity skills but at the same time it was about luck. I am very disappointed in Nintendo's decision but I guess each console has its end-of-life when the servers are shut down (see Xbox and Playstation 2). If you don't care about the online gaming portion, please proceed.", "This game is just horrible compared to the older mario karts like 64 or double dash.  In the old games, nintendo tried to make the gameplay good.  But, here all they care about is gimmicks like the steering wheel and miis.  In the older mario karts the person who was the best driver would win.  But here, the person who gets the best items wins.  It's all based on luck.  There is this item that is a blue koopa shell with wings.  It goes after the player in first and blows them up.  in double dash, you rarely get hit by it.  In the wii version, you get hit by the blue shell all the time and its very annoying.  The whole game is just lazy.  Half the courses are copies of the old games.  The controls on the wii wheel are horrible because you can't do the mini turbos like before.  And even worse, on the new wiis you can't plug and gamecube controller into them.  Also when you buy ANY kind of wii it does NOT come with a gamecube controller.  That's really stupid because the older ones have support for them.  I recommend to just sell that Wii, and buy a Super Nintendo, a Nintendo 64, or a GameCube."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07694818079471588, 0.10042152553796768, 0.002794139552861452, 0.11321409791707993, 0.16203095018863678, 0.08306679129600525, 0.0035801276098936796, 0.09447859972715378, 0.06839125603437424, 0.002471860032528639, 0.09940236806869507, 0.038039982318878174, 0.007029371336102486, 0.08256175369024277, 0.06556899100542068]]}
