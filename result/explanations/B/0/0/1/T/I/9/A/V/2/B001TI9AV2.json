The handle is comfy and the carrying case is plenty big to fit the folded up triangle. The reflective surface is great and the white is good for diffusing.", "\"These are \"\"generic\"\" (knock offs) of theLastolite LL LR3628 33-Inch TriGrip Reflector (Sunlite/SoftSilver)but for 1/5th the cost.  I bought the gold/silver and the silver/white and the construction of the silver/white is much better.  It looks like version 2.0 and the gold/silver the beta.  The grip is actually just a bit of canvas with Velcro over the wire.  The white/silver one has a foam grip.Not much to say about a reflector.  it reflects light.  So far, no flaking of the surface.  About the only other thing that could go wrong is the bag and I can confidently predict it will fail soon.  It is a tight fit and the zipper doesn't look very sturdy.  I use the laptop section of myKata KT DR-467 Digital Rucksack (Black)to hold my reflectors so its no big deal to me.Good value and so far good construction.  The shipping charges are pretty outrageous compared to the cost of the items.  If you have a buddy who wants to go in on a purchase, its worth a \"\"group\"\" buy.\"", "Good size.  It works if you know how to use it.  Only thing that sucks is the handle.  It's just some padding and would be fine if it didn't spin around.  This makes holding it with one hand and trying to maneuver it hard.  I bought this so I can use with one hand and the handle doesn't work.  It still works over all if you just grab the frame.  It breaks down into a nice size.Overall, it's ok and for the price, I don't regret it.", "I've had this for a year now. Light use, but it does what it's supposed to do. Nice small unit perfect for a one man operation (camera in one hand, reflector on the other). I have bigger reflectors, but this is perfect for when chasing around a couple at weddings.", "I have learned over the years that in some cases you simply have to pay more for quality when it comes to photography. This is not one of those cases. I own a number of expensive reflectors such as theLastolite LL LR3628 30-Inch TriGrip Reflector (Sunlite/SoftSilver). I purchased theCowboyStudio Photo Studio 24in 2-in-1 Triangular Collapsible Disc Reflector, White / Silverto see if a cheaper alternative was viable. It is.  In fact, I have become increasingly impressed with all Cowboy Studio products and have yet to be disappointed.There is no perceptible difference in light quality between this product and more expensive versions. I found the product build quality to excellent. Though some will complain the reflector case is flimsy, I find this to be no different for intermediate and even far more expensive similar products. I have used this product a dozen times so far and I am very happy.In the end, you have to ask if it is really worth paying more. In the case of reflectors, and this specific reflector, save yourself some money. Chances are you will leave it behind at a shoot before you need to replace it; just the same as other brands.", "\"* Specifications *Folded diameter in pouch: 10 inch / 25.3 cmWeight including pouch: 5.82 oz / 165 gUnfolded size, longest side/height - outer frame: 27 inch / 68.5 cmUnfolded size, shortest side/width - outer frame: 24.5 inch / 61 cm* Quality *Good quality for the price. Frame and material are less thick and heavy than I thought by looking at the photos but on the other hand I'm surprised how lightweight it is. The material wrapped with Velcro around the handle feels a little cheap but then it has no major function other than covering a stitching.I think the reflector will last a while, and for the price I wouldn't be upset if I have to replace it in a couple of years anyway.* About the size *It's a very compact reflector. I have a round 43 inch reflector too, which is sitting in my closet because I can't use it without an assistant - too large, unusable when windy, no way to direct it while taking photos. This one is pretty portable and I can use it with one hand while operating a camera with the other. The handle definitely helps for that.Thanks to it's compact size and weight, this reflector now goes with me everywhere because it easily fits in my messenger bag. It has a good size to eliminate shadows in faces, but not for the whole body of course.* White / Silver *Some reflectors also offer a gold side and a black side. While there might be uses for that, the only thing you need for outdoor portraits is white and silver. The white side is less brutal and good for eliminating shadows especially when you operate it very close to your subject's face. You can use the white side for reflecting the sunlight without causing too much squinting.The silver side reflects the sunlight almost with its full power. Be careful when using the silver side!* Why I think you don't need a gold side *The reflection level is the same as with the silver side, with the difference that it makes a very warm (gold-ish) color. Well, I guess you are shooting in digital and I assume in RAW anyway. Adding a warm tone to a well exposed photo is not a problem - but removing it while maintaining a natural overall color it is often more complicated. I find photos taken with the light of a gold-sided reflector makes too yellowish, unnatural colors. There is a reason why the standard photo lights available have a neutral daylight color... the reason is that you can easily change color temperature in post processing when your base is an image file without any artificial tones added. The silver side gives you a neutral color that matches the rest of your surrounding because it just reflects the given light without adding color. Enough said, just my 2 cents on the silver vs. gold thing. Conclusion: This reflector has all you need.* Folding it back *Unless you are familiar with folding a light tent or portable softbox, you want to figure out how to fold it back before embarrassing yourself in front of others... You simply twist it twice: Hold it on the frame with two hands, form an \"\"8\"\" and then make the same turn again. Definitely search Youtube for \"\"how to fold a reflector\"\".\"", "I own a couple 5-in-1 reflectors, but wanted something for smaller spaces and more portable for backpacking.  This fits the bill.  While it doesn't have the gold or black surfaces, the white and silver fit my needs on the trail.  It easily fits into my Mountainsmith camera backpack and folds into its own little case.", "Definitely not a TriGrip, but at this price, why argue. The handle is just some foam around the supporting band. It slips. So if you are trying to hold it up with one hand, you better have a good grip. Need to find a handle that will mount on it to make it more usable.Would rate it three starts except for the price."], "Gamma": [0.17844732105731964, 0.4107763171195984, 0.4107763171195984], "Beta": [[0.17862972617149353, 0.022073766216635704, 0.2143383026123047, 0.16547498106956482, 0.017092399299144745, 0.1639716476202011, 0.04009241610765457, 0.1983267366886139], [0.18908420205116272, 0.006895272061228752, 0.22672590613365173, 0.17439062893390656, 0.004317030310630798, 0.17199890315532684, 0.017203567549586296, 0.20938453078269958], [0.18908418715000153, 0.006895295809954405, 0.22672587633132935, 0.17439061403274536, 0.004317048471421003, 0.17199888825416565, 0.01720361039042473, 0.2093845158815384]]}
