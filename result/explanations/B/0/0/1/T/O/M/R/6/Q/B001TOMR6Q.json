I do not own a Gameboy Advance, nor do I own a regular DS, so I have never played these games. I understand that they're really really good, but I only know this from hearsay. All that I've got to judge the series on is this game. And it is a bit of a mixed bag.The gameplay here is pretty clever. Your characters are given psynergy based on a specific element which allows them to do special moves. Earth adepts for example can move certain rocks, air adepts can blow flowers into the air making elevated paths etc. It leads to a lot of creative puzzles which is good. You gain new moves by collecting djinns, which you then attach to one of your characters. Think Pokemon except they help you fight instead of fighting for you. The mechanics of this are too complicated to get into in a brief review, but they are not too difficult to master. None of the fights are that difficult until the last one, at which point you better hope you've been leveling up enough!The characters in this game are pretty good. Matthew is your PC, and as such he never speaks. Just like Link. I could get real sick of this... On the plus side they do give you options as to how emotionally he'll respond: hyper, happy, indifferent, or angry. None of these matter, but they'll get a slightly different reaction out of whoever you're talking to and make you feel a bit more like you're controlling him. Matthew is also an earth adept. Karis is a wind adept who is basically the sensible one of the party. Tyrell is a fire adept, and extremely impulsive and volatile. They all appear to be children of the previous leads of the series.I like these characters. The only real problem I have characterwise is that we never get to see them interact. There are a few moments of character interaction (mostly towards the beginning of the game) but almost all dialogue is plot driven. And the plot is interminably boring and repetitive.In the previous games you saved the world by restoring alchemy, or so I understand. This did bad things to the world but was probably better than an apocalypse so you're in the clear. In this game, your quest is equally epic and thrilling. You're to recover the feather of a mountain roc so that you can repair your glidery thing. Yup, that is actually the entire plot right there. At the end of the game you're returning with that darn feather. Actually, the sheer inconsequentiality of the main quest is one of the funnier things about the game. Obviously you encounter worse problems on your way and end up having to save the world (this is an RPG after all) but the main quest remains something basic that feels like it should take five minutes. The problem is that the epic part of the plot doesn't kick in for way way too long leaving your characters drifting through a world with no real purpose. It's boring. They needed to introduce the real danger a whole lot earlier instead of just having you waste your time on contrived sidequests.For the first maybe third of the game you are trapped beneath a mountain range. There are three cities here and nothing else. You have to go from city to city and back to activate the device that will get you over the mountain. There's no sense of threat or danger, and nothing to keep the player interested. Then you get over the mountain and things slowly start to kick off. I did find myself enjoying the game by the end, but it took too darn long to get there and I'm not sure it was worth it. The guy who turns out to be the main villain is somebody from the first game, and I had to have my roommate who's played it explain to me who he was. The rest of the game is very open to new players, but this guy gets no explanation at all. He doesn't reveal his identity til the very end and I was like meh? Then you beat the boss and the game ends abruptly with a major cliffhanger, setting up a sequel that shows no sign of being released anytime soon. It's entirely unsatisfying.I did like the game by the end. The plot wasn't too bad apart from the horrible pacing issues. If a sequel came out I would play it, if only to see where they were going with this. The gameplay was fun and the characters entertaining. If they include a decent plot next time (and they certainly seem to be going somewhere with this) then it could be one of the best RPGs released on that console. As it stands, this game is part brilliant, part terrible. The brilliant outweighs the terrible though, and leaves it as merely good. A shame given its potential.", "\"I've been playing this almost steadily for the past day & a half, but haven't yet finished the game. (I'll try to update this review after finishing the game.)This entry into the Golden Sun game follows the children of the \"\"Warriors of Vale\"\", which may disappoint those who were hoping to control Issac & company yet again on their journey. Not to worry though, the game creators did a great job of fleshing out these characters & animating them. So on to the review:Animation:  Better than the older games, but that's to be expected. Taking into consideration the time period differences between the three games, players can expect this game to keep up the tradition of having excellent graphics for a handheld game.Story: Excellent. It's a little slow to start off, but quickly picks up the pace as you play. Like another reviewer has stated, the game is pretty wordy but then, you should expect that from a GS game.Game Play: Players will be glad to know that you can operate this without a stylus, although using the psyenergy is easier with the stylus than without. The fighting is still turn based like the previous games were, so fans of this style of gaming (like me) will have fun with this.  (Additional: I'm further in the game & can see where others are saying that this is an easier play than the previous 2 games. Still some challenge to it, but so far I haven't seen anything along the lines of the Lighthouses or the Gondowan statue so far, though.)Replay value: I haven't finished it yet, but I can say that this will have some replay value to fans of the GS games or those who like completing all the little tasks they didn't catch the first time through. (I'm going to assume that this game will allow you to go back through the game with your powered up players like the previous two games did.) I will say that the only thing holding some people back from replaying it will be the massive amount of dialogue. If you've played the previous games then this won't deter you, but occasionally I did long for a skip button akin to the one in some of the Zelda DS games.Standalone: You can easily play this without having to have played the previous two games. In fact, that's probably why part of the game is devoted to defining key players, locations, & events in the game. (It doesn't interefere with game play, with the definitions showing up on the upper screen of the DS while the action takes place below. Looking at the definitions is completely optional.) If you look hard, there's also books that you can pick up in various places in the game that give you the story of what happened before. Of course I recommend playing the first games, though- they're worth tracking down!Overall this is an excellent game & I'm glad that I stalked my local GameStop on the day this released so I could be one of the first to get it. While there's some recycled content from the previous games as far as puzzled go, overall this was a pretty fun game to play. Better than the first two? No, unfortunately those who are looking for something to beat the first two games will be slightly disappointed. Is it good as a game on its own? Yep- as a stand alone game this is pretty good. I just hope it doesn't take them another six years to put out another entry in the game!Annendum: (after finishing game)I just wanted to say that after finishing the game, my opinions are quite similar to what they were when I started & wrote this review. I had a lot of fun playing this game & while it isn't as challenging as the original two were, it's still a pretty cool game.There is a replay option, but it is rather limited in comparison to how it was in the previous two games where you could replay from the very start of the game. :(\"", "\"It is! It's my fault for being desperate for a good JRPG on my DS. I'm so desperate that I'll pick up the aggressively mediocre spawn of one of my favorite portable RPGs, and you know what? I'll probably even play it to the end. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is a disappointment, made all the more so by the excellent first installment of the series, which came out way back in 2001. The sequel, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, well-reviewed but unplayed by me, came out back in 2003. I'd always wanted to pick it up if I found it for cheap, but haven't had the opportunity. Now I'm not so sure.The gameplay of Dark Dawn is fairly standard turn-based RPG fare, which is just fine with me. There aren't enough games of that description coming out anymore, and even Square's Final Fantasy series doesn't really fit the mold anymore. The problem isn't with the underlying system, which hasn't evolved much since 2001 and doesn't need to, but the balance of the game. Somehow, and I have no idea how this happened, Dark Dawn manages to have very few random battles and simultaneously be easier than just about any RPG I've ever played. I'm not asking the game to make me grind, but at 15 hours I have yet to use an item for healing. I also have yet to have a character knocked out. The last 2 boss battles are the first ones where I've needed to heal at all.I never thought I'd complain that an RPG had too few random battles, but here it is; Golden Sun: Dark Dawn has too few. Since they're so easy, one can blow through them by tapping A over and over again to use the regular attacks with no strategy, no peril, and no challenge.And that's not getting into the lack of boss battles. It used to be standard procedure- finish a dungeon, there's a boss. The bad guy shows up? Fight his underling, and/or him. Creepy plant look at you funny? Kill it dead. But for some reason, modern RPGs miss this, and Dark Dawn is a particularly bad offender. Somehow, the developers thought that after a long conversation with the game's villains, we would be all geared up to... exit the dungeon and return the world map. How hard is this? Color swap some late-game enemies, add a single line of dialogue (\"\"Enough talk! Face this thing I found under my sink!\"\" or some such), and cue the special music. You can even skip a couple of those steps if you're lazy. Just give me more bosses! Or stronger regular enemies! Anything to make the game more challenging!The basic strategy for any boss battle can be summarized by this; unleash all your djinn, cast the highest-level summon you have, and if the boss is still alive, attack until the djinn are reset and repeat. I've fought one boss so far that lives through the first step. I assume the game thinks that unleashing djinn is a trade-off to the increased stats that they grant, but honestly? I never even noticed. A risk-reward system of this type would be an interesting was to improve on the old RPG formula, but it's a wasted opportunity here.And that's not even touching that statuses hardly have any affect on gameplay; I've been \"\"wrapped in delusion\"\" more times than I can count and I still don't know what it does. Locking an enemy's psyenergy sounds useful, but why bother, since the game is so easy? And once again I have the question of why regular attacks don't wake sleeping enemies or party members. The game also seems to think that packing dungeons with items that heal these will somehow balance this, when really it just makes me think, \"\"Aw, I wanted new armor.\"\"AND money is a joke. I never had to sell equipment or anything else in order afford new equipment, and the one time I couldn't afford new equipment for everyone, it didn't even matter because the game is so easy. Since there's no point in buying healing items, and the statuses that actually do something (like being haunted) can't be cured with items anyway, I am sitting on a big pile of money that can't be used. The buying and selling interface could be better, too, but it's a minor complaint among these others.But let's step back from all that. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn's dialogue is wretched, even by JRPG standards. I expect some of this. I expect people to talk too much in these games, as a rule. I still don't know what happened throughout most of Final Fantasy XII. But that game was great. There's a sequence in Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, in which the characters indicate that they are rushing to save someone's sister, and that she will be boiled alive if they fail (really). During this section of the game, the characters WILL NOT SHUT UP. Forgive me if I can't sweep this under the rug of \"\"RPG conventions,\"\" but can ANYBODY play this sequence and doubt for a second that the sister will be rescued? Can anyone think that their actions will matter in the slightest as to whether the sister will live or die? There are times I can buy this; I understand that Sephiroth's Meteor will hit earth \"\"sometime soon\"\" even as I endlessly force chocobos to mate for my amusement. But there are sequences in that game that involved real urgency, where the player's actions could actually make Cloud and friends fail.It doesn't stop there. Dark Dawn's dialogue endlessly repeats itself, even when it writes in sequences that seem designed to avoid doing so. An example; the character Sveta can read minds, and once she does, what does she do? Repeat the same thing that all the other characters in the room, we, and everyone else in the game world ALREADY KNOWS. AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTERS, WHOSE MINDS HAVE JUST BEEN READ, REPEAT IT TOO. Who can defend this writing?The game's puzzles are marginally better than its dialogue. That is, until one picks up the \"\"Insight\"\" psyenergy, which literally puts a filter on the screen that shows you the solution to puzzles. Some of them overcome this by being about positioning and/or some other cleverness, but they are the exception when they should be the rule. Stuck? Use Insight. Now you're not.The looks great and sounds pretty good (though many of the tunes are less memorable than in the first game, and the color palette seems a bit muted compared to that, too), but art design can only go so far. At this point, we need better than competent and good-looking. The only reason to consider Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is if you're like me; starved for a traditional JRPG on a portable system. Lord knows I won't blame you for picking it up, but if you do so before getting the infinitely superior Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 remakes, you've lost your will to be entertained.\"", "The RPG elements of this game were played up most in its descriptions before it even came out. While I understood this would be an SRPG, the descriptions did not make it clear to me that there is a HUGE puzzle dimension to this game, so much that it is an RPG/Puzzle game, not a strategy role playing game.I have to give credit where it is due: I like the story, graphics, and RPG elements of this game, and there are plenty of other reasons this is a well received game. But potential buyers be warned that if you are do not enjoy puzzle style strategy injected into your RPGs, you may not like this title. It is not that the puzzles are that hard, but are redundant and boring and FOR ME, don't belong in a game like this.", "\"The first Golden Sun wowed gamers on the GBA by being one of the most amazing RPGs to ever grace a handheld.  Golden Sun: The Lost Age continued this amazing series in 2003.  But after that the series went on a seven year break.  Now that the third one is finally here one has to wonder if it's worth it.  The good news is that it is.  Even if it hasn't really evolved much.  But this also means that much of what made the original two great will surely make this one great as well.Golden Sun: Dark Dawn takes place 30 years after the events of the second game and you'll play as the offspring of the heroes of the previous two games.  The second game in the series ended with the release of Alchemy back into the world of Weyward and it's changing things in several ways across the world.  The story actually has promise, but it takes a while to really get going.  If there's one thing about Golden Sun that might've been best to change, it would be how the story paces.  It takes several hours for the story to really get going.The story is also drowned out in tons and tons and tons of dialog.  One of the things the Golden Sun games have always been bad about is being much more dialog heavy than your average RPG.  Characters will take lots and lots of time to explain the simplest and most basic of things.  Understand, however, that the problem isn't \"\"too much talking,\"\" the problem is that much of the dialog is superfluous.  There will be moments where you get the feeling your characters are talking about nothing or talking in circles.  This probably comes to light most in some of the conversations where there are encyclopedia entries for you to click on and learn more about Weyward.  For example, early on it'll mention Vale.  You click it and learn that it was a village that was destroyed alchemy was released (something already told to you in the opening crawl anyway).  In spite of clicking on it to learn about it, the characters will actually explain it to you anyway.  Even in moments where they ask if you understand something... even saying that you do will prompt the characters to explain it anyway.Golden Sun Dark Dawn stays familiar in more ways than one.  If you were acquainted with the first two Golden Sun titles, then Dark Dawn is like squeezing your hands into a familiar pair of gloves.  Much about Dark Dawn operates in the same manner.  The Djinn system is back and it's more or less the same as it's always been.  As you travel the world you'll meet several Djinn who will give your characters powers.  There are four types: Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Mercury.  Each with their own elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water, respectively.  When you set a Djinni to the character they'll grow more powerful and be able to cast some powerful spells.  This is also how they'll change job classes.  There's nothing quite like it in any other RPG.  It's still unique to Golden Sun.Likewise, the game's battle system hasn't really changed a whole lot either.  It's the same old turn based affair where you select all your characters actions and then watch them proceed in battle.  Golden Sun's battles are fairly fast paced, although much of it is on the easy side.  There's not a lot of deep strategy involved in Dark Dawn.  There are plenty of ways to dispatch your enemies.  Either by normal attacks or by Psynergy (Golden Sun's form of magic).  The animations in battle are great--especially the summons.  It's definitely easy on the eyes.  While the battles may not be hard, the dungeons can sometimes keep you busy with their puzzles.  Most puzzles are pretty straightforward and simple, but others will have you scratching your head and really challenging you.  One of the other unique things about Golden Sun is that there are a lot of spells that are actually used outside of battle as well.  You'll cast spells to help you put out flames, or move objects around or make vines grow.  The puzzle element can often be more fun than the battles.It's the story that doesn't balance rather well with it all.  We talked a little about the ridiculous amounts of dialog and exposition, but another thing that's a little annoying are some of the responses you have to give.  The game has a way of presenting you with choosing which mood to respond in, although you don't always know how you're supposed to respond.  In the end the only thing it changes is how characters respond to you.  You'll also be asked lots of yes or no questions.  In most cases your response doesn't matter here either as you'll still get an earful anyway.  In the other instance they'll keep posing the question to you until you choose the response they want.  In a way this is charming.  You have a silent protagonist (it wouldn't be Golden Sun without a silent protagonist) but the \"\"Yes/No\"\" questions weren't much to write home about in the first two anyway and here the extra layer of choosing a mood doesn't add a whole lot to the experience.In spite of all this, Golden Sun is still a fantastic game.  The dialog may be superfluous at times but the story and the characters within it are still charming in their own way.  The game also utilizes a lot of 3D which is something a good deal of DS games still don't do.  Make no mistake: Golden Sun Dark Dawn is beautiful and it runs rather smoothly.  The environments are colorful but the best is definitely the detail put into the battles, with characters moving fluently.  The summon animations really showcase what Golden Sun is capable of.  From a production standpoint, Golden Sun Dark Dawn is one of the best looking games you can find on the DS.  A game on the DS has simply never looked this good, and it certainly hasn't sounded this good either.  There aren't really any voices to speak of but the melodies the soundtrack provides will make you glad for that.So was the long wait worth it for fans of the first two Golden Sun games?  Definitely.  Everything about Dark Dawn is purely Golden Sun.  The game hasn't evolved much in its jump from the GBA to the DS, however.  Purist of Golden Sun probably won't mind this.  For others it means that Golden Sun reveals certain aspects about the JRPG that might seem a little dated.  In spite of that, while some of the mechanics may be dated, they happen to mesh together really well and stick to what really works for Golden Sun.  Meaning the only REAL letdown Golden Sun: Dark Dawn might have is that the game doesn't do much to reach above what the first two achieved.  Is this a bad thing?  Not exactly.  For handheld RPGs, the original two gave several console games a run for their money by being so well constructed.  The third game does the same thing.  Even if there isn't much change in that construction.  At the very least, it shows that Golden Sun has aged rather well.  Especially considering it had a seven year break.  There's still nothing quite like it.In spite of some of its flaws (which aren't really big--especially one you settle in and get absorbed) the important thing is simple: Golden Sun Dark Dawn is just a lot of fun to play.  There's no reason for an RPG fan not to play it.  It's big, it's epic and it's a blast to play.\"", "Golden Sun Dark Dawn is a sequel, of sorts, to the original GBA games. You play the son of the main character from the first games in this one.The battle mechanics of turn based fighting are in place here, with only the Djinn really changing things up. Depending on the Djinn you equip on characters, they will have different spell abilities and also ramifications towards what class they are. Part of the strategy is equipping your entire crew with complimentary Djinn.Graphics aren't bad. Nothing completely amazing. Animation is good.The sound... I don't know. The music is forgettable. The sound effects go from fitting to odd and overall sound quality is simply OK.Overall, it's not a bad game. It's just another example of a typical JRPG. It doesn't come off as a shining example of what makes a great JRPG, but on the flip side it doesn't make the case for what entails a BAD JRPG either. It's simply good.", "I remember back when I was playing Golden Sun for GBA. I used to play for hours and end up buying alot of batteries, until I got the GBA SP. I didnt hear about Dark Dawn until I bought a DS two weeks ago and saw this when I was searching for DS games. I just had to get it. I bought this from seller 5 STAR GAMING and they delivered it SUPER fast. It shipped and I recieved it the next day, I GOT FREE ONE DAY SHIPPING! So far I love this game as much as GS and GS Lost Ages. The main theme song has not changed a bit but I still love it. Most things are still the same like the combat system, using Psynergy to solve puzzles, and the Djinn, even the main characters! They look just like their parents. Isaac makes a return as an older, wiser person and you play as his son, who looks exactly like him in the first GS. I love the upgrade to 3D models and animation, even though I did love the 2D of the other two GS. The battle animations are well done. Summoning animations are spectacular to watch now that they have 3D makeover. I cant tell too much as I am only a few hours into the game. Within those few hours, theres going to be ALOT of talking and pressing A. They really like inform you on the situation. Even though most things are the same I'm still going to pour hours into this game.", "Golden Sun Dark Dawn is a pretty phenomenal RPG for the Nintendo DS. Rather than being essentially an RPG that starts off immediately after its previous entry, it decides to do something unlike other RPGs and have us play as the offspring of the Warriors of Vale from the first game to explore the world after the rise of the Golden Sun.The game once again allows for eight characters, all of which are related to the previous warriors in some way. This time there are more than 72 Djinn available (the elemental creatures that can bestow difference skills and abilities), there are new psynergy skills (possibly close to a hundred with many that can be used on the field to solve puzzles and dungeons, mind read, and teleport).The game lasted me about 40 hours, which involved me being able to get all of the Djinn, all of the summons available to get before the ending of the story, and to complete the story and defeat the final boss. It does open up later after beating the final boss to get the remaining summons and rare weapons and to face the strongest boss of the game which will be a challenge in and of itself.The Dark Dawn is the typical turn based RPG, with the Djinn being able to be summoned and kept in reserve to enable the player to unleash powerful summons, weapons themselves can unleashed multiple skills, making it a pleasure to resort to using psynergy and weapons, and the djinn can be shuffled around to change the classes of characters to reveal more psynergy to use during battles. I also enjoyed how changes to the characters weapons also appeared to affect their character models in the battle area.Dark Dawn looks amazing and all of the locales are lush and lively. Nonplayable characters had interesting conversations and moved about on the land. The various regional designs of buildings was a nice thing to see. Ultimately, it felt like I was actually exploring the world and it felt immersive.I really had no cons with the game apart from the game left me wanting more because I had so many unanswered questions at the end, but all in all, this is one of the definitive RPGs available from Nintendo and should be played by all whether or not they played the previous entries"], "Gamma": [0.08321449905633926, 0.06714281439781189, 0.08314183354377747, 0.07578840106725693, 0.08238105475902557, 0.08315960317850113, 0.08238664269447327, 0.030099889263510704, 0.08321569114923477, 0.08324965834617615, 0.07971544563770294, 0.08324927091598511, 0.08325514197349548], "Beta": [[0.2330799549818039, 0.22946955263614655, 0.04706358537077904, 0.011605753563344479, 0.100718192756176, 0.24532917141914368, 0.0036728307604789734, 0.1290609985589981], [0.226540207862854, 0.22516310214996338, 0.05241217091679573, 0.014523777179419994, 0.10498324781656265, 0.23906368017196655, 0.004979517310857773, 0.13233429193496704], [0.2330540120601654, 0.22945113480091095, 0.0470861941576004, 0.011617795564234257, 0.10073553770780563, 0.24530251324176788, 0.003678093897178769, 0.1290747970342636], [0.23000673949718475, 0.22755120694637299, 0.04945403337478638, 0.012900237925350666, 0.10273278504610062, 0.24247604608535767, 0.0042312974110245705, 0.1306477040052414], [0.2327386885881424, 0.2292541116476059, 0.04733053967356682, 0.011745763942599297, 0.10094387829303741, 0.2450130581855774, 0.0037327012978494167, 0.12924136221408844], [0.23305101692676544, 0.2294669896364212, 0.047085270285606384, 0.011614058166742325, 0.1007152870297432, 0.24532191455364227, 0.0036772252060472965, 0.12906822562217712], [0.23272770643234253, 0.22925950586795807, 0.04724155738949776, 0.011753189377486706, 0.1010468378663063, 0.24494758248329163, 0.0037270020693540573, 0.12929658591747284], [0.2088620364665985, 0.21313652396202087, 0.0668192207813263, 0.024810029193758965, 0.114571213722229, 0.22248725593090057, 0.010111906565725803, 0.1392018347978592], [0.23307983577251434, 0.22946962714195251, 0.047063473612070084, 0.011605540290474892, 0.10071833431720734, 0.2453293651342392, 0.0036727599799633026, 0.12906105816364288], [0.23309442400932312, 0.22947880625724792, 0.04705209285020828, 0.011599818244576454, 0.10070854425430298, 0.24534274637699127, 0.0036703255027532578, 0.12905335426330566], [0.23212331533432007, 0.228661447763443, 0.04772375151515007, 0.012243648990988731, 0.10152362287044525, 0.24409347772598267, 0.0039110020734369755, 0.1297198235988617], [0.2330940067768097, 0.22947806119918823, 0.04705245792865753, 0.011599899269640446, 0.10070933401584625, 0.24534212052822113, 0.0036703739315271378, 0.1290537565946579], [0.23309624195098877, 0.22947970032691956, 0.04705072194337845, 0.01159887108951807, 0.10070760548114777, 0.24534446001052856, 0.00366995926015079, 0.12905241549015045]]}
