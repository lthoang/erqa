On the PS3 that basically puts it up against Gran Turismo and GRID. Can it make enough of an impact to get your pocket money? Probably.The saviour of the PS3 is the ability to download game demos. Without this, I would never have bought Need For Speed: Shift. The reason? The last 3 or 4 NFS games have been simply terrible and I didn't expect this to be any different. I'm pleased to say that's not the case this time around though.GameplaySo what do you get with NFS:Shift? Well it's basically a single-play linear career mode, and online play. Whilst the career mode aims to be free-form, it really isn't. Race, win, buy, race, win again - that's what it's all about. In 'easy' mode, even the most mediocre driver will come first every time. You really need to set the game to 'medium' before it starts to become challenging.If you've read any of my previous reviews on racing games, there are two things which bug me: the other driver AI, and the damage model. Gran Turismo is at one end of this line - the AI is abominable and there is no damage model (although we still wait to see if GT5 manages to pull this off). At the other end of the line is GRID, where the AI is actually pretty good and the damage model is extremely effective. NFS:Shift straddles the line almost dead centre. The AI is certainly better than GT5, and in some ways I actually think it's better than GRID too - the other drivers do make mistakes - big ones sometimes. But they won't swat you out of the way if you're on their racing line. Having said that, if you get testy with them, they will retaliate in kind - so don't go barging them around and expect to have a free ride. One negative point about the AI vehicles - whilst you will slip and slide and slow down when you go gardening, they don't. They can rip across grass and through gravel traps without slowing down. It makes for an unbalanced racing experience especially if you are in an endurance race. If you go off in a collective crash, whilst you're fussing about trying to get back on track, the AI vehicles will simply drive off leaving you in the dust.The car damage model is also better than GT5 but doesn't go far enough. There's dings and scratches, and occasionally you can rip off the hood, but the wholesale destruction of GRID just isn't there. You can jam a Pagani Zonda R into a wall at 200km/h and it will bend and scratch and bounce off, but still be driveable. This isn't right - obviously. Look at GRID. Look at Forza on the Xbox. These games know how to do car damage properly. NFS:Shift is good, but not good enough in this area.In career mode, you progress by winning races, earning stars and increasing your driver ranking. Cash is needed for vehicles and upgrades, whilst stars and driver ranking determine your overall progress through the game. Stars are awarded for set tasks within each race - for example reaching a preset speed, or earning a certain number of experience points. Experience points are earned for just about anything but are broken into two categories - precision and aggression. If you drive close to the racing line, hit the apex on every corner and do clean overtakes, you get precision points. If you constantly end up smashing into other cars, drafting them and trading paint, you get aggression points. Depending on which you have more of, that determines which invitational events get offered to you. More precise drivers get invited to hot lap and timed events, whilst more aggressive drivers get invited to last-man-standing and knockout events.You'll find a handful of different types of race available all through the game from straight pack racing, to manufacturer specials, to drift events to one-on-one races. Special attention has to be paid here to the drifting events. Whilst the car handling in normal racing is quite competent, the handling in the drift events is borderline retarded. It's so bad that not even the AI can control your car properly - after you finish and event and the AI takes over whilst the scores are displayed, your car will be spinning wildly in a circle or slamming into the wall. Which is exactly how you'll be playing - spinning wildly or slamming into the walls. They've made the car so loose for the drift events that the slightest touch on the throttle results in the car spinning. It's completely unrealistic and totally ruins the whole point of drift events. They should have made it so that it takes effort to get the car into a slide, and skill to keep it there. Instead, the cars are so willing to slide that they're simply uncontrollable. The first time you try the drift events, you'll have all the review complaints in the back of your mind and you'll be thinking \"\"surely it's not that bad\"\". Minutes later, you'll be thankful that the career progression doesn't require you to actually complete the drift events to complete the game.The cars in NFS:Shift are an eclectic bunch from older VW Golfs all the way up to Veyrons and Zondas. There's about 60 in total - nowhere near the count of some games, but enough of a selection for most people. Each car can be upgraded with cash in several categories - aerodynamics, brakes, engine etc - the usual stuff.  Although the way the career mode unlocks new cars, you'll often be partway through building up your current vehicle, only to be offered a top-of-the-line Ace of Spades. It becomes annoying after a while and removes the incentive to stick with one car and fettle it until it's a winner - just go any buy the top-line car straight away.The cars can be customised with different rims, paint jobs and graphics, although why they bothered I don't know. The paint colours are easy enough but you'll die before you manage to get any graphics on the car in anything like the style you want. There's no alignment or coordinate grid, no copy and paste - it's all done manually. There's not even a 'mirror' option, so if you get one side of your car looking how you want, you then have to manually do the other side too. Frankly though the chances of even getting one side looking how you want are slim at best. Fortunately there's some decent pre-built paint and vinyl jobs that you can choose from.GraphicsLets get this out of the way right up front. Yet another \"\"next generation\"\" game that really isn't. That's right folks - it's a 720p game, not full HD. And whilst it's better-looking than (for example) FUEL, it's nothing like the eye candy that the PS3 is actually capable of. Once again, coding for multiple platforms means that the PS3 owners take it in the pants because the games house has to code for the lowest common denominator - Xbox.So taking the low resolution into consideration, the graphics are adequate. The in-car views are by far and away the best in any non-HD game so far and thankfully, the default camera is in-car. There's a couple of other views - hood view, fender view, and the always present and always useless above-and-behind view (why do they still bother with this one?)All the tracks are nicely represented and instantly recognisable to anyone into motorsports. The corkscrew at Laguna Seca is very nicely turned out, and the London street racing circuit passes by a ton of very recognisable landmarks. It's not full-on simulation though - there's some artistic license here and there, but it's done well and done for effect, and never detracts from the game itself.The car modelling is also adequate. Not as good as Gran Turismo or Forza, but all recognisable makes and models. The on-car vinyls and graphics are a bit sketchy though - very blurry and the entire game suffers badly from blurry texture on oblique surfaces. For example on the sides of buildings, or the sides of the cars in replay - the graphics fuzz out very quickly. Also the level of detail modelling on the cars is very abrupt. When they change from the lower level of detail to the higher level of detail, there's a noticable 'pop' in the shape and shading which can be very distracting at times.What is very well done are the in-car driver effects. The view bobs and shakes with every corner, dab of the brakes and sideswipe. Rather than the classic rock-solid head-in-a-vice view that we're used to, NFS:Shift gives us a far more dynamic experience and it is so much the better for it. Layered on top of all the motion are G-effects - blurred vision, tunnel vision, G-loc, blackout - all very convincing representations of the frail nature of the human body. Slam your car sideways into a wall at 100mph and you'll get blurry, grey vision for a few moments. Very clever and very effective.Sadly, all the good points are marred by the choppy framerate. Everything's fine when you're out in front, but if you're mid-pack, the framerate is all over the place. Sometimes it drops so suddenly that it actually interferes with the gameplay itself - almost like the game is spending so long trying to draw the next frame that it's ignoring the input from the player. This is inexcusable on a machine as powerful as the PS3.Replay/photo modeLike all racing games now, there's a fairly comprehensive replay and photo mode in NFS:Shift. The replay isn't as fine-tuneable as it is in Codemasters games (GRID, DIRT2, FUEL etc) in that you can't go into super-slow-motion and soak up the view, but it's useable at least. The one oddity is that when you take a snapshot in-game, rather than do the logical thing which would be to store it in your pictures folder on your PS3, it uploads the picture to the NFS website instead. There you have to navigate a ton of bloat just to find the darned pictures. Why?AudioThe audio in NFS:Shift is a high point. Whilst it gets a bit choppy in some places, the overall effect is great. You get the impression they went out and sampled the engine noises from inside the car and did it properly. All sounds are very well represented, from squealing brakes, to rattling bodywork, turbo blow-off valves, supercharger whine and induction roar. If you're one of those who plays racers in the above-and-behind camera view (why?) then you'll miss most of the audio in this game.Another good point to note - there is in-game music, but by default it's turned off so you can actually concentrate on the act of driving and the sounds of being in the car.ConclusionWell we're still waiting for Gran Turismo 5. It's either going to be the best racing game in the history of forever, or it's going to suck big time. In the meantime, satisfy yourself with NFS:Shift. Sure it's not HD. Sure the graphics are blurry and the framerate is choppy. Sure it's not really a next-gen game. But that's not the point because to use a well-worn phrase, it's so much better than the sum of its parts. Whilst all the cons are very irritating on their own, when you're mid-pack fighting for position in the Eau Rouge corner at Spa, frankly none of them matter.\"", "Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.Should of bought a racing wheel too but that had to wait.", "\"Let's be honest about this up front. The Need for Speed series has been, well, pretty much dead the past 3 years. The happy-go-lucky 100% non-story-based tuner car customizing wacky police chasing magic was gone, and NFS: Undercover in 2008 did very little to revive that feeling. The series was in the midst of an identity crisis. There are only two places to go from a spot like that, as you can either go back to the tried-and-true formula, or work toward finding a new niche in the market. EA has opted for the later, aiming for a game toward the level of a simulator that completely takes street racing and horribly AI-clueless police out of the picture and puts you on real-world tracks. A bold move, to say the least. The only catch is giving the game as much mass appeal as possible.There has always been two distinct camps in the GT/racing gaming market: sim versus arcade. The likes of Gran Tourismo, Forza and rForce versus Midnight Club, Burnout and the oldschool Need for Speed. Some companies (namely Codemasters) have tried to bridge that gap with titled like `Drit' and `Grid' by starting on one end and leaning in toward the center. The Japanese market has a few different solutions including touge racing and its (very real) underground racing world, which combine the heavy tuner aspect of arcade versus needing to know the mechanical ins and outs of a car to get true performance from it.  To date, no one has truly been able to split the gap between simulation and arcade feel. Need for Speed: Shift is no different. It's the biggest effort yet to make a solid compromise both ends of the spectrum, but in the process it fails to entirely please fans of either style.The game scenario is exceedingly simple, as it should be. Its lack of involvement in what you need to do is a refreshing change. You start out with nothing but a little cash, start with one car, and race your way to the top. Nice and easy and lets you pick which events you'd like to participate in at your own pace in whatever cars you happen to like. Your early races are on variations of famous tracks, but you'll soon be racing on some of the world's more popular Gran Prix tracks. All the real-world tracks are very faithful recreations of the originals, which is kind nod to the simulator crowd. Some absolute classic circuits are included, including Silverstone, Spa and Road America. If you have no idea what any of those are, you're probably already at a disadvantage toward understanding this game.Car selection is impressive, if not a bit small. About 60 cars in total, options range from daily-driver basic sporty coupes such at the Scion tC and Honda Civic Si until you reach the top which is occupied by the world's most absurd hypercars, and everything in the middle. At the top end, you'll be zooming about in the infamous Bugatti Veyron, Zondas, Lamborghinis and the like. An exciting thought to throw down on some great tracks, to say the least. Each car (besides the end-game hypercars) is upgradable in a normal game style, allowing you to improve different aspects of the vehicle. Tuning options are ridiculously vast and include a massive range of settings, including variations to parts that 90% of players will never have heard of. How many people know what adjusting the position of a bump stop does? Again, a nod to the simulator crowd. There is a `quick tune' option instead of digging into every detail, but the effects on the car are rather vague compared to digging into the details yourself. At no point, however, does victory completely hinge on being able to dial in a car to its limits. This can be seen as either a good or bad thing. Some of the vehicles, on top of their normal string of upgrades, have a special tuning option, which is the \"\"Works package\"\" conversion. The idea being to turn what was left of your street car and turn it into a track-carving beast, it completely eliminates whatever civility left in the drive in the name of speed. Kind of. It can certainly be fun to see something like a Nissan GT-R turn into a car that you'd see in the Japan Super GT series. Key here being that only some cars can be upgraded this way, and most of the luxury/exotic models must be left alone with just a body kit at most.So far so good, right? Lots of bits to please the simulator fans and drag them in. What about the arcade-racer end of the line? Plenty of good additions here, as well. The sensitivity of all the controls and inputs are adjustable and levels of CPU assisted driving variable so that you can turn some cars into a flail-the-wheel-all-the-way-over-to-corner type you'd normally see. There is a Drifting game mode, which is little more than a matter of knowing when the mash the throttle and make the car get loose. You can turn on the racing line for each track so you know when to brake, there's a mini-map that varies in size with your speed to show you the track, etc. Some of the available assists to help you around the track include stability control and enhanced traction control. Some new and curious ideas include steering assist and braking assist.Wait. Steering assist? Braking assist? This is where NFS: Shift dives into inner conflict and begins its failure to combine the two racing camps. I don't just mean anti-lock brake assist to help you stop (also an option) or it being harder to spin out in a corner, I mean LITERAL steering and braking assist, as in the game will slightly steer and slow the car for you when it deems it necessary. Though this might sound like a boon to the fan of the arcade racer since it dumbs down the complexity of GP circuits, it's actually a substantial curse. It's quite concerning to see an AI try to move you into a turn or tell you what speed to take it at. It's an insult to simulator fans and to arcade racers alike, as both of them just want to drive the car and be on with it. Mistakes and crashes only hut the car visually (except on the highest difficulty), so there's no real penalty for messing up besides losing some track time. There's even a button to reset your car on the track if you crash or spin out too far. What's most frightful about these assists is that most of the cars feel uncontrollable without them on, and the design of the gameplay and AI doesn't allow you to go \"\"full-sim\"\" without huge penalties. The only consolation is that you can change your assist settings at any time during any event from the pause menu.Now that we've spoiled the game for Simulator fans, let's see how it looks the other way around. Your first event is racing a BMW M3 on a short circuit so the game can judge your skill and suggesting a starting difficulty. For someone used to an arcade style of racing, it'll take a good dozen tries to get around the 1-mile track without flying off repeatedly. The feel is, without massive adjustments to control settings and sensitivities, pretty much of terror for a more casual driving game player. You'll be accelerating on straight, slamming the brakes before each corner to a near-stop, turning very slowly, and repeating. This is not a very glorious or fun way to zip about some of the greatest racetracks in the world and it makes the experience of it being on real-world tracks completely meaningless. As the game events get harder and longer, the sense of helplessness while driving quickly around twisty tracks never entirely goes away and even when you think you're used to it you're forced to use faster cars which just start the process all over again. I say that as someone who has wasted hundreds of hours in every variety of racing game and as someone who has always laughed when they made a huge driving error that resulted in a crash. I've been through it all and even I've gotten annoyed. So, not this time. Crashes and runoffs are frustrating and feel like they're often no fault of your own. With a dozen or so different types of car assists available, it's quite possible it wasn't your fault.Digging deeper into that helpless feeling, we run into one of the key selling points of the game. As has been hyped in advertising, the game has a robust and detailed cockpit view that gives the player the \"\"feeling\"\" of speed. At anything over 100mph (160kmh), the sides of the screen will start to blur out and only have complete focus straight ahead, which is meant to be a \"\"simulation\"\" of real race-speed driving. By the time you're up to 150mph you'll be terrified to go any faster and above that you might as well drive with your eyes closed. It's a novel idea, but inconsistent and feels far more like a gimmick to avoid framerate issues in a highly-detailed cockpit than a true game feature. In actuality, it forces you to leave the racing line option on at all times and keep the braking assist, since it's absolutely impossible to see your braking or turn-in points for sweeping corners with everything but the 2ft of pavement in front of you blurred out. Thankfully, the game keeps the option of bumper, hood and third-person views available for you. I'd suggest hood view for a good experience without the drawbacks that make ten-tenths racing impossible, as the blurring effects only exist in cockpit mode. This is certainly not a game for third-person view. One interesting thing I do like about this style, however, is what happens when you crash or hit objects. The entire screen will grey out and get fuzzy, akin to a driver having to regain focus when all sense of direction is lost and panic sets in. Sadly, this cannot be turned off.The graphics are generally solid if you look past the deliberately-blurry speed effects. Cars are replicated down to the symbols on the rims and the size/color of the brake parts. The real-world track recreation is outstanding (though I question what they consider the racing line to be at times). Road America is my `local' track and the sensation of driving it in-game versus real life is solid, so I'd figure others will feel the same way. Menus are neat and tidy, fonts crisp. It's far from the detail of a Forza or Gran Tourismo but it certainly gets the job done outside of a sizable number of technical glitches. It's worth noting that none of the graphical bugs actually affect gameplay.Despite all this negativity, I can't deny there's fun to be had. It's hard to argue against a lot of the cars here and some of the tracks. It will just take a whole lot of tolerance and patience to find this small window of zen. Might I suggest spinning a Porsche Cayman around Donington for awhile?Sound is both amazing and disappointing. The sound effects of the cars (namely engines in heavy race tune) boils the blood and will leave you continuously wanting to turn up the volume. Though surround sound features don't seem terribly impressive, having a subwoofer really helps. On the other hand, the game soundtrack is absolutely horrible, just like with most EA games. Luckily, the music setting for in-race is set to `off' by default, which is where you'll want to leave it. The soundtrack will really only come up during replays, autosave time and drift events. It's tolerable, if not a tad obnoxious.The awards system is a strongpoint I think a lot of players might overlook in the middle of either being annoyed that their car is behaving too blandly on a twisty circuit or that their car is impossible to control at high speeds. As you play you earn badges which are essentially just marks of progress. They count how many passes you've made, how much you draft, how much contact you make, your wins on different difficulties, etc. It's well thought-out, and the game is kind enough to offer its top trophies/etc without having to complete extreme online racing requirements. You overall progress is marked in drivers levels from 1 to 50, and the game will keep track of whether you are a Precision driver (smooth, clean driving) or an Aggression one (constantly bashing other cars and skidding around everywhere). Just based on how racing games work, however, you will inevitably end up at Precision. In order to add up Aggression points means you have to remain in the main field and bash up with your opponents, with is both dangerous and not very good way to drive to victory. The AI is very aggressive and has no problem shoving you off-track, though I'm not sure if it's deliberate or accidental programming. In any case, you want to be in front and stay in front.Multiplayer is slick, if not somewhat limited. Games come up quickly and lag control is tidy. In most games, contact with your opponents will feel like it actually should have happened and wasn't just a fluke of the server being confused about where the cars were. One thing the multiplayer does make you stare in the fact of a lot, however, is load times. They're absolutely awful in all game modes, with over 30 seconds from menu to race start.A variety of other issues/complaints include, but are not limited to: an inability to use a custom controller button configuration (absolutely inexcusable), highly-tuned cars on default settings being created such that they will literally bounce down the track on long straights from the car bottoming out, an inability to customize the exterior pieces of your car, an awful livery editor, an incredibly confusing HUD while racing, the anti-gravity physics of Drift mode, no races longer than 20 minutes or so even in \"\"endurance\"\" events, highest tier of cars have no sense of interaction between the driver and track, lower-tier modified cars are substantially faster than the endgame 750hp+ cars, huge numbers of loopholes that allow you to bypass ever having to play at a normal difficulty, and the lack of a free race mode that just lets you practice.I won't deny that I've gotten my kicks from the game and I'm had fun, but it's only come after a whole lot of trial and error or settings and configuration to find out the few things that won't continuously annoy you. With any luck, some of the frustrating default suspension settings and AI will be patched and FAQs will get out there that will help on car setup on different tracks.All in all, Need for Speed: Shift is proof that you can't please the masses by compromising between different sub-genres of games. The game gets close(r) to a balance of simulation and arcade at times, but mashes the edges together far too much. Honestly, the game is more likely to appeal to racing purists that want to drive F1 and DTM circuits for fun than it will the average person who wants to hurl a fast car around the pavement. Such a focus won't revitalize the series and won't turn much of a profit.\"", "\"+ Graphics on par if not little better than Gran Turismo Prologue, simulation is also better.+ Removed unnecessary police chases+ Removed emo/rock music as the game de-facto for the in-game music+ Finally some power cars (European sports cars such as Lamborghini, Ferrari etc)- You have to work hard to get all the stars of each challenge(Load times make sense for such a \"\"big\"\" game - we're not talking about Tetris here)\"", "I am really enjoying Shift and recommend it, especially to Gran Turismo fans.  I feel this is a good alternative to the really high priced Gran Turismo 5.  Gran Turismo may have way more content such as more tracks and cars and car customizing options, but Shift has all that to some extent, although to a lesser degree, and is way cheaper.  I have been a fan of racing games for years and have played everything ranging from Gran Turismo 1-4 to Grid, Blur, and the NFS titles.  I also have a good mix of dirt racing in there as well.  Shift is a worthy purchase until GT5 reduces in price.Sound: Excellent engine sounds, but NFS has always had great engine sounds.Graphics: Great both inside the car(cockpit view) and out(chase cam).Gameplay: A little touchy to drive but not uncontrollable.Car Selection:  Anything from like a Chevy Cobalt to Pagoni ZondaCustomizing Options:  paint jobs, tuning upgrades(including NOS), visual upgrades", "Setup:PlayStation 3 120 GBLogitech G27 Racing Wheel for PC and PS3I have yet to wreck my car so bad that I couldn't drive it any longer on NFS:Shift. It is a much better sim than any previous NFS game. The arcade mode is still there in that you can use any car ahead of you to slow down into a corner. Get behind? Drive like a maniac and then slam into the cars ahead, sure the hood will crumple but you will blast them off the track and if your good you can then run ahead on to the next set and slam into them. Its like a mix of a demolition derby and a racing sim.There are a ton of redeeming qualities in this game though, so dont think its all bad;Cockpit:The cockpits of these cars look very authentic. I am a fan of Top Gear and have seen every car in this game on that show several times (except the Camaro) and the cockpits here look identical. When you drive a car it tallies up the miles you have driven it which is cool to say you have driven a few thousand miles in car X. It makes you want to keep a car longer just so you can become more proficient.AI:Not bad, many of them want to kill you and they will try to run you off the road. Which can help you get ready for online races because they will do the exact same thing.Cars:Very accurate but indestructible. Drive a Zonda or Veyron into a wall at 200 MPH and it will only dent the hood slighlty and may break the lenses.I can only compare this to another driving sim even though its an off road rally game. Comparing this toDirt 2and you will see some glaring issues. First off in Dirt if you hit a wall or even a hay bale at speed you may risk ripping a body panel off or even the wheel; ending your race. In Shift you can slam into anything you want and it will keep on going.Issue 2: the gravel is impossible to turn on. I realize hitting gravel at high speed means you can not turn as sharply but in Shift you hit it at anything over 20 and you will hit the wall.Issue 3: The car customizing is really difficult to do. Want to do ralley stripes on your car, it can take 30 minutes or more to get them all in place, hit a wrong button and all that work is gone.Pros:>> Wonderful car models>> Drive some of the rarest cars on the planet>> Accurate cockpits>> Cool animations when you hit thingsCons:&lt;&lt; Ultra difficult 1 on 1 sponsored races (if the guy gets away you might as well reset)&lt;&lt; Very easy to win races by using cars ahead as bumpers to slow into corners&lt;&lt; Little to no consequence for whacking a car or a wallOverall this is a very good racing arcade game. I will not call it a full on racing sim yet, maybe with the next iteration.Thanks for reading my review.", "\"So this game got down to $10, and I said \"\"what the heck\"\".  I'm more of an arcade style racer (i.e Blur) but am trying to expand my horizons seeing as the servers will be shut down for that game any day now.The premise of NFS: Shift is to qualify and then win the NFS World Tour.  There are 4 \"\"tiers\"\", each of which brings better cars and tougher opponents/competition.You will fall under one of two driving styles, though for me I'm always \"\"precision\"\" (i.e. mastering corners, staying on driving line, etc).  The other is \"\"aggression\"\" (dirty overtakes, trading paint, etc).  I find running into cars is going to spin you out more often then not so it's easier to just stay on the line and try to take turns properly.This game offers a ton of customization, from paint to rims to adjusting downforce, gear ratios, etc.  It can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be.Now, as far as the events, most are easy with the exception of the drifing ones.  Those are a pain.  There are some good FAQ's out there as well as YouTube videos, you can't just buy a \"\"drift\"\" car and expect to do well.  You WILL need to adjust your car's settings to get the podium spots.Multiplayer is there but I have not tested it at this point.  The server could very well be shut down.  I'll update this review once I've tested it.Overall, this is now a good value and if you leave it on the easiest settings is very accessible for a racer.\"", "\"Because GT5 had been getting such mixed reviews -- and each new version of that game feels so much like the one before -- I decided to try this NFS equivalent of a race car driving simulation, and after several hours of playing the game, I'm enjoying it a great deal.For those who complain that the handling of the cars is too difficult to master here, I recommend making sure you have the \"\"Perfect Line\"\" option enabled.  This is a dotted green line on the pavement that shows the best steering trajectory; equally important, the line turns yellow or red if you need to slow down to take a tight curve.The game gives you a choice of viewpoints, but the one I'm using -- and appreciating -- is the \"\"inside the cockpit\"\" view, which is the actual driver's perspective -- you see your hands on the steering wheel, the dash instrumentation, and the view through the windshield and rear-view mirrors.As others have noted, the graphics and sound are superb -- fully on a par with the Gran Turismo games, as far as I can tell.  Like the GT games, NFS:S lets you race on actual race tracks from around the world.I can't comment on how well the game interfaces with third-party steering wheels.  I can say that it seems to work well with the standard wireless shock controller, and indeed I enjoy the \"\"feedback\"\" when I accelerate from a standing start or run off the track.The career mode gives you plenty to do.  As you progress, you are awarded more types of events, higher tiers of competition, and money to buy and upgrade better cars.  Compared to the Gran Turismo games, you don't have to spend as much time here with the \"\"spud cars\"\" -- Ford Focuses and the like.  You can upgrade pretty quickly to BMW M3's and other nice rides, with high-end Lamborghinis, Paganis, etc. just down the road.So if you would like to try a great-looking race simulator and are bored of the Gran Turismo series, give NFS:S a try.  At Amazon's current price, a purchase is a no-brainer.UPDATE: did I say this game is DEEP?  I've been playing it for hours now, and I keep opening up new events.  Cars of one country pitted against cars of another... special events pitting one supercar against another... lap eliminations... it goes on and on.Even though I have NFS: Hot Pursuit in the house -- and I love it -- I've been playing nothing but NFS:Shift since I got it a few weeks ago.So if you want to save a few pennies and you don't have either of these NFS titles, I suggest starting with Shift first.  It's available at a reduced \"\"Greatest Hits\"\" price.  By the time you're done with it -- this could be months of racing -- perhaps Hot Pursuit will also have dropped in price.  Again, I highly recommend both titles!UPDATE NUMBER TWO: I have to mention one strange bug in the game -- sometimes, if you smack into the rear end of another car, it will vault up in the air like a balloon!  Needless to say, this weightless effect detracts from the versimilitude of the game, but in truth it doesn't bother me, as I am usually more than happy to knock another racer out of my way, however it is depicted onscreen.\"", "The problem with this game is it's not arcade enough and it's definitely not a racing sim like Forza or GT Series is about. Then what is it? I'm not even sure. The races are pretty short and you start in the very last place, it's not a lot of time to pass the other cars. However, if you switch to manual transmission and learn how to control the car, getting first place on a stock car is not very hard in the first races. The hard part is keeping your hands from cramping. There are no button remapping options for the game, while you accelerate with R2, you've also got to shift up with R1. This is uncomfortable and takes away a bit of the enjoyment.The online mode pairs you up with one other person, it's really not that interesting or exciting, either. I don't even consider that a mode worth including or maybe they've included out of just including a mode that does online of some sort. This is a lazy game and if anyone has played another recent racer like Forza, GT, PGR Series, and even Grid will feel ripped off by it.", "\"This game is a lot better than the reviews claim it to be. I recently sold a lot of my games to Amazon's trade in program, but kept this game because I do enjoy racing, and so far this is my personal favorite on the PS3.  There are flaws, and here are the flaws I see.1. Driving on the line is hard with the faster cars. I used the Lamborghini Murcielago at the higher stages and quickly learned that staying on the line was impossible for me, so I would slow down, direct my car in the direction I wanted to go, and floored it. It provided a little drift which I like, but am sure that isn't what the game designers had in mind.2. The drift races were just too complicated to control with the faster cars. I avoided the drift races at the higher stages.3. Lack of tunnels and things to look at. I understand that this is supposed to be a simulator, but I bought this game after playing the demo which included the London Track. I enjoy the London and Tokyo tracks the most.__________________________________________________________________________________________Things I likedThings I liked were the fact that you could drive in the cockpit mode or view the car from the outside.1. The cockpits are beautiful and realistic. I enjoyed playing at the lower levels with the Ford Focus SVT, and couldn't get over the fact how realistic it was inside the car.2. The narrator. I could swear that this is Captain Price from Modern Warfare 2. He is pleasant, tells you what your objectives are, reassures you, and tells you \"\"just have fun\"\". I love this! Captain Price FTW!3. The out of car views remind me a lot of an arcade racer. Reminds me a lot of when Trip Hawkins released the first Need for Speed for the 3DO. Trip now runs EA, and has made EA what it is today. I guarantee he will read all of these reviews, and will fix the flaws. Trip Hawkins is a true genius.Until the next racer comes out, Need for Speed Shift will remain the king of racers (IN MY OPINION).\"", "Basically I did not like the sim / arcade mix. I should have known I wouldn't like it since I don't like sims at all. I like arcade racers and their fun unrealistic physics. NFS Undercover would have been fine except for the horrible frame rate (sold that one within 2 weeks). I never even tried Pro Street other than the demo. Maybe next go round they'll do what I've been waiting for which is a NFS Undercover type game with the frame rate of (or better than) NFS Carbon. So I sold my copy within the first week which frees up some money for Uncharted 2.", "\"Need for Speed: Shift is this year's iteration of the annual Need for Speed Series.  Forgoing its dependence on the underground street racing scene, this one moves the series into the realm of simulation real world racing.  Pretty much, this game relies on the sense of speed and the forgoing of police chases, nitrous boosts, etc.Need for Speed Shift is definitely a step in the right direction for the series that people claim has been losing its thrill in recent years.  Although fans of Underground and etc may feel like a foreigner to the series when playing this game; Shift stands to appeal to fans of simulation racing.  In this game you can buy a myriad of cars, unlock them in greater tiers of races, or mod them to your hearts content.  The game has about over 50 different cars that are equivalent to their real world counterparts (with extremely detailed cockpit views).  There are also over 20 different tracks that all have a variety of race types on them.  You can take part in Drifting competitions (like the real world Drift events), car battles, races, timed laps.  A player will go through all of these events in the career mode as they work to earn money, and reach the Need for Speed World Cup.Shift excels in the presentation department.  The cockpit view is the best racing perspective in this game (there are the usual options here) for it adds an extra element of personality to it when you are in this view and the screen blurs if you crash, or if you crash quite hard your in car driver will grunt.  You are also able to see them shift gears too.  The game has damage so in this cockpit view your cars screen will crack, or you will see your hood fly off.  The tracks look amazing and one would be fooled into thinking it is an actual real life representation of the track.  For example, one wouldnt believe how much the Laguna Seca corkscrew mimics the actual real life track. The track themselves, you will see spectators waving their flags, the blurring effects look great as you pass them by as well as others.  The thrill of speed is accurately felt in this game too.  Other minor details are noticiable such as the Ferris Wheel spinning in one track too.Soundwise, the games soundtrack for in race music is set to be off by default but one can turn it on for the usual variety of picks from Electronic Arts and licensed music.  Sound effects are accurately represented and vary for each car.  If it is a low powered car then the engine will sound low powered and vice versa.  The English narrator is quite excellent in explaining various items and for items where his explanation is off, you can press L1 to hear it, such as on the customization screen when you need to upgrade the car (helpful if you dont know why you would pay $12,000 to upgrade your engine, etc).Mechanics wise, the game will start you off by having you race one practice lap to determine your settings.  These settings can range from having the racing line turned on, auto steering/auto braking turned on, and whether or not it will have your damage set to \"\"visual only\"\" or full damage in which your driving will be affected.  After doing this it will determine a difficulty setting and move you on to the career mode. In this mode there are several tears and more tiers can be unlocked by gaining stars. Stars are earned on each race by winning, meeting the points requirement, or meeting a speed threshold.  You earn points by performing \"\"Precision\"\" actions or \"\"Aggressive\"\" actions.  Which this ensures is that while everyone may not be able to achieve first place, each race will net you points for your driver profile (which is an ingame achievement system which gives you a driver level which nets you access to more money, events, and upgrades).  Precision actions are those in which you overtake an opponent without touching their car, following the race line, mastering a corner, while aggressive actions are those in which you try to ram cars off the road, spin them out of control, etc.  The AI will cater to your style as well.  You can also use the profile to search for races with other players just like you.Ultimately there is much more to Need For Speed Shift than I can put into writing, however, this game is a pretty amazing offering from EA and is a nice new direction for the Need for Speed Shift series to take.  Apart from only offering the 50+ cars, there is nothing that negative about the game.  It could even be comparable to that of GT5 Prologue, GRID, and Forza.  For the first of its kind from this developer, I would say this was an amazing undertaking that doesnt fail to please racing fans.*Controls:  I play the game using the control pad.  The control setting that is set by default may not be pleasing to most players however, in car customization and such you can undertake advance settings to change extremely meticulous settings to allow for more changes that will cause you to drive less \"\"jeeringly\"\" and more smoothly.  Try it out. A wheel would be nice to have too!Pros-Nice, new, fresh direction for Need for Speed Series-Detailed SIM racer-Detailed Car Customization-High production values-Decent DualShock 3 Controls-Love the trophies-Driver Profile is addicting-Tracks from around the world-Upgrading Tier 1 cars is rewarding in later tiers and events.Cons-People who expect police chases, traps, an \"\"arcadey nitrous rush\"\" will be disappointed-Controls take getting used to-Would have been nice to have over 100+ carsEdit: Patch 1.01 released on Sept 24, 2009, which corrects damage, offering Full Damage model being able to be turned off or on, and actually shown on the car.\""], "Gamma": [0.228608638048172, 0.22537453472614288, 0.272982120513916, 0.2730347216129303], "Beta": [[0.06360853463411331, 0.19252096116542816, 0.012205053120851517, 0.14761312305927277, 0.02713754214346409, 0.10867628455162048, 0.008411216549575329, 0.04842230677604675, 0.11139296740293503, 0.21553730964660645, 0.01406800001859665, 0.050406672060489655], [0.06383559107780457, 0.191965252161026, 0.012354119680821896, 0.14748449623584747, 0.027342738583683968, 0.10880959033966064, 0.00853691529482603, 0.04865560308098793, 0.1113818809390068, 0.2147669941186905, 0.014229187741875648, 0.05063757300376892], [0.05976381152868271, 0.20241224765777588, 0.0098268399015069, 0.14940381050109863, 0.023815812543034554, 0.10513141006231308, 0.0064800819382071495, 0.044616006314754486, 0.11178547888994217, 0.22970271110534668, 0.011476797983050346, 0.04558500647544861], [0.059758659452199936, 0.20242375135421753, 0.009824034757912159, 0.14940570294857025, 0.02381136640906334, 0.10512684285640717, 0.0064781042747199535, 0.0446120910346508, 0.11178703606128693, 0.2297196239233017, 0.011473693884909153, 0.045579057186841965]]}
