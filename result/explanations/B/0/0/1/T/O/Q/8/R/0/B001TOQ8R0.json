You will find yourself SCREAMING at the computer when you are jumping are trying to get away during a chase. And it doesn't help that the game is a port and all the controls are STILL labeled with console buttons. Very poor production Ubisoft.2) Many of the puzzles are IMPOSSIBLE. My girlfriend in a member of MENSA, and even she was unable to figure many of them out. I'm guessing most people had to do what I did and get the solutions off the internet. Seriously, you really think a teenager is going to know what a Fibonacci Sequence is? Come on!  The good thing is you do not need to do these to complete the game.  I recommend skipping them to save yourself the frustration.On the upside, if you can deal with these to things, the game is loooooooooong.  I have been playing for two months now, and I just finished last night.  Looks like AC 3 is in the works!", "Yes, this means you need to be ALWAYS connected to the internet in order to be able to play this, and if by any chance the Ubisoft servers have any type of problem, like the HUGE problem they are having right now, this means you don't get to play a game you ALREADY payed for. Also none of these companies that implement this type of DRM protection tell you what happens 10 years down the line, when they no longer offer server support for their games, but you know what happens right?, your game becomes USELESS, because it enforces you to authenticate with them, whether the servers are available or not.Simple advice, stay away from buying this game or ANY OTHER DRM based game, send these companies a message. And to add insult to injury they sell the game not at the common 49.99 PC game price, but the 60 dollar prices that is only specific to consoles, these gaming companies are getting really arrogant and overconfident in how they treat consumers, it's time to give them a hard time when possible.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.", "Apparently the paying customers are their enemy. How else could you explain a DRM scheme that locks the game into an account, and requires a constant internet connection? Your internet connection is flaky, you get kicked out of the game. I truly hoped this day would never come. And to think that I encouraged people to buy Prince of Persia (another Ubi game), because it had no DRM. I now feel sick for telling people to support this company.Ubisoft, I would like to inform you that I am never buying another game of yours ever again, even if you decide to release them all DRM-free. The abusive DRM scheme used in AC2/SH5/other-upcoming-games proves that you are a company with no ethics or morals, and you deserve to go bankrupt.", "PAY TO PLAY, and all the big boys are doing everything they can to scratch their way to it. So, if YOU pay for any game that requires anything more than a CD check or a CD key YOU are hurting the gaming industry in a big way!", "Are you not a pirate? No? Too bad, Ubi is going to treat you as one.Great game from a HORRIBLE company.  DRM is POINTLESS. Just angers people.A game WILL be pirated no matter what DRM you try to put on it.No internet connection?  The only way you can play it is if you DO get apirated version.. How dumb is that?  I am starting to put Ubisoft right upthere with SOE..  Shame on you Ubi! I am sorry I spent the money :(", "\"Assassin's Creed 2 is a very well made game on its own and a vast improvement over AC1.  It provides a semi-open gaming environment with a well balanced mixture of exploration, combat, free running (Parkour), and a sort of pseudo-but-enjoyable stealth gameplay.To begin with, like its predecessor, the game does have beautiful graphics and well designed levels that let Gamers experience the Italian Renaissance in some famous the city-states such as Florence, Tuscany, and Venice.  Indeed, the level designs, although some what idealized, seem very authentic when compared against some of the pictures of the actual locales.  On the other hand, character design is a mixed bag.  The men generally look good, but not the women (what's up with that ?)Furthermore, although I am not qualified to comment on the degree of authenticity of the architecture and the attires of the period -  they sure look authentic to me - I can truly say that weapon designs are authentic (except for the pistol and the hidden blades which I don't know enough to comment on).  Edged weapon collectors and enthusiasts like myself will instantly recognize some designs unique to this approximate time period such as the Cinquedea (a dagger with very wide fuller) or the Schiavona (the Italian version of the Scottish Basket Hilt Claymore).  As a side note for the collectors out there, almost all of the weapons featured in the game can be found on The Museum Replica Limited catalog (I think this is actual source material for the dev team).  Bravo to the dev team for the extraordinary level of dedication to authenticity in weapon design.As for the gameplay, the constant reminder of the stupid `animus machine' that does not really achieve anything besides breaking the immersion of the game in AC1 is mostly gone.  Although it is still there in AC2, you hardly interact with it anymore.  This is bar none the biggest improvement over AC1 IMO since the rude interruption of immersion is what really prevented me from finishing AC1.Talking about immersion, the game also does a very good job of that.  Along with richly detailed level designs mentioned earlier, each city-state has its own distinctive atmosphere, and the in-game background music - usually with a dab of Gregorian chants - is also a nice touch that adds to the overall experience.Combat wise, it is nice to be wielding authentic weapons in a series of nicely animated moves.  However, in spite of the numerous moves, the combat elements is not all that deep; you only need to remember about 3 crucial moves (`disarm' and `counter-kill' is the best).  Free running is fun but can be very challenging on the side quests.  The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but the mingling of fact and fiction is what make it really interesting to me.In addition to some console features (such as having to approach the spot on the ground with the `twirly light' to advance the story) that slightly detract from the immersion factor, and the `Da Vinci' code wannabe decoding sequences, Stealth elements are incomplete - if not weak.  Evidently, this assassins does not possess true stealth of cover and concealment (remember the classic \"\"Thief\"\" series ?); his only meant of avoidance of detection is really speed and agility.  However, even when the gameplay seems to be absurd, it still somehow manages to be fun.  For example, being the only guy wearing a hood and standing in the middle of four prostitutes who are flaunting their `wares' ... is NOT blending into the crowd; but as you can see, this could be fun... I ought to try it sometimes.Also, in AC2, you have a villa and a walled town to call your own that you can maintain and improve (almost like the D'Arnise Keep style from Baldur's Gate 2) that, when properly renovated, will provides more cash income than you know what to do with.  You can also put on your own nifty touch by collecting famous paintings (but not sculptures) to decorate and add values to your family property.  Again, a very nice touch.In short, AC2 is a very good game that teeters on the border of being an exceptionally great game.  And although I wish to go back to the Holy Land and the Middle East again in AC2, I must admit that cantering around the rolling hills of Tuscany on horseback never really get old.  Regrettably, the happiness must end for the PC version of the game -- Even this deadly assassin is crippled by abusive DRM.Even though it is never explicitly stated, the primary purpose of DRM - especially the excessive and overbearing type of DRM, such as limited online activation, or in this case, online activation AND permanent internet connection -  is to *TIE ONE USER TO ONE LICENSE* by eliminating the sales of the actual product (since the actual product is protected by the First Sale Doctrine), and forcing the sale of a license only -- Everything else is secondary - piracy is just a convenient pretext to achieve this purpose.Evidently, Ubisoft is willing to go to any length to achieve this purpose - including deliberately insulting its Customers and their intelligence - with this type of extreme DRM.  It is rare when industry insiders and DRM/corporate sympathizers are openly speaking out against their own, but Ubisoft has really crossed the line this time. As is, my message to Ubisoft will be curt:  Revert to a more reasonable DRM that Customers can compromise with  - such as a disc check, or GET OUT of the PC Gaming sector for good.  You will NOT be missed.A message to my fellow Customers: However you choose to speak out against Ubisoft and this type of extreme DRM, please refrain from pirating this game.  It may seems like a good way to piss down Ubisoft's throat for now, but in the long run, it is not worth compromising our integrity as legitimate Customers for; no game - no matter how good - is worth this.If you must play this game - a good game from an excellent dev team misrepresented by the Ubisoft suits  - consider renting the console version, or buying the game *used* for the consoles so that the greedy publisher will see as little of your money as possible.  I was waiting for the PC version  - since AC1 PC version is superior - but I am somewhat glad that I bought  a used copy for the Xbox360  when the price drop to $26.  Had I known about the travesty of PC version, I would have waited even longer to buy a used copy for even cheaper.Final scores:  Four stars for the game.  Zero star for the product.\"", "You can't even buy a digital download of this game from Steam or Direct2Drive without the same DRM scheme. Having an internet connection at all times...I'd understand if the DRM actually stopped pirates. But it doesn't.I'd wait for the bargain bin on this one. Or just get a Xbox360/PS3.", "I started out playing Console games Back when you had to place an overlay on the TV screen before there were PC games.When Pc games came along I switched to them.I have watched Pc games get better and better over the years untill thy reached there zenith about 5 years agoe.From that point on it has been a slow down hill slide.The games themselves seemed to get less Interesting to play.The graphics did not get any better.It just took a more expensive graphics card and more memory to play them at the optium resolution.The games started having a lot of problems even on the higher PC game rigs.The players had to start downloading more Patches just to keep the games playable even then they had to learn to live with multiple Crashes.The big Game producers started Introducing More road blocks to the PC games in the form of DRM,On line activation,Limited plays,Manditory joining Social Clubs,Having to regester the game.At the same time the lowly Consoles started getting better And better Graphics.Now the Console Graphics have finally cought up with the PC.I have switched back to playing Console games.Thy are the same games,Thy come out on the Consoles first then are ported to the PC,Thy play smoother on the consoles with less problems,No DRM or any of the other problems that plague PC games.The Games cost a little more for the Consoles but on the other hand a Console Rig costs less than just A top of the line PC Graphics card.Now that new PC's come loaded onley with VISTA or WINDOWS 7 Older games can no longer be played on them while thy can still be played on the Consoles.A few years agoe I predicted that Pc gamming would become Obsolete if we continued to buy PC games with all the restrictions.All I got was a lot on Flack from PC Gamers.Now it has got even worse than I thought it would.If you don't believe I predicted this check out my older reviews.As for the game review:Assassins Creed 2 is one of the best of a bad bunch!!!!!", "DRM aside, this is a great game. I never liked the original game, it was just too boring. The developers changed a lot and I really enjoy it now. The story hooked me from the beginning which is something that doesn't happen a lot for me (Mass Effect and ME 2 were the only others). I play games for the story and graphics. For a game that is from 2009, this has great graphics. It also has tons of game play and action to keep you from getting bored. It plays well on my machine but some of my stuff is dated (ie - Q6600 CPU, 8800GTX GPU). I would recommend this game to anyone.", "Package states nothing about a constant internet connection. Product is defective not due to the hard work of the developers, but the DRM requirements. Since you cannot return open software packages, I think a lawsuit is in order........again, and this is not an empty threat, I know just who to call.", "\"Gaming has hit an all time low thanks to UBI Soft. If you didn't like draconian DRM schemes, you're going to hate UBI Soft's new policy: you must be connected to their servers 100% of the time to play Assasin's Creed 2. If you don't have internet, or if your internet is out, or if you are on vacation, stationed in Iraq, or want to play at the airport, you are out of luck. No game for you. That in itself is very troubling and reason enough to NOT BUY THIS GAME. However, there are additional reasons that are even more frightening:1) Setting the precedent for future gamesIf gamers buy Assasin's Creed despite this huge limitation on game play, it will open the door to many more games like this in the future. That would be awful for the consumer.2) Turning 'owning' into leasing\"\"Tying games to some sort of server for activation is bad enough, but making them DEPENDENT on a server is horrible for the consumer. It takes away our rights (to play the game we paid for on our terms) and creates a system whereby you are simply LEASING a game. If at some point UBI Soft decides to take down their servers, you lose your game. They can take away your rights to play the game at any point in the future if they decided to. They have you by the cajones! If you give into this model, expect to never own any digital medium again; the makers of games, producers of music, and distributors of movies would love to see our current model of OWNING a physical copy of your game \\ album \\ movie replaced with a system where you only own the 'right' to access \\ play that medium. It's their wet-dream to turn the current system of ownership on its head so they can re-sell you things endlessly as well as take them away from you at their discretion. As a consumer, it's important that we speak out against this by supporting DRM free games (Mass Effect II, Dragon Age, Fallout III, etc...) and DRM free music (buy it from Amazon!) and REFUSE to buy this junk with built in limitations and restrictions that SERVE NO PURPOSE.3) Making games dependent on 'phoning home' means you're at the total mercy of UBI Soft (or whomever runs their servers)If their servers are down, you lose access to your game. If their servers are overtaxed, you may experience problems connecting to your game. Think that isn't likely? Think again. Currently (03/09/2010) the servers have been down for the last 12 hours or so, creating chaos for all those who expected to be able to fire up Assassin's Creed. It doesn't even matter if UBI Soft is malevolent or not; if your service provider has a bad week you may be out of luck. If there is a storm in your area, you could end up out of luck for weeks (this happened to me when a tree knocked out my cable internet for 9 says straight--I thought I was going to die). You're screwed if your internet, their servers, or anything along the line between the two goes down.4) DRM is pointless (and this online restriction is one of it's worst forms!)Want to pirate games? It's tragically easy these days. Even more tragic is that DRM, supposedly designed to prevent piracy, is a total failure at actually accomplishing that. Want proof? Google \"\"Spore + DRM + Piracy\"\" and see what you come up with. I'll give you a hint: Spore was pirated BEFORE it was officially released. Many games are unto torrent sites well before their release date. The worst part of this is that the pirated versions are in almost all cases SUPERIOR to the DRM infested versions: they don't contain the invasive, crippling, and destructive DRM that past games have been ruined by (Bioshock, Mass Effect I, Spore, etc...). I am NOT ADVOCATING PIRACY. I think you should buy the games you want to play. I am advocating NOT BUYING games that violate your basic consumer rights (right to resell your game, right to play your game WHENEVER you want to without restrictions). If a game limits those rights, I say skip it entirely. Because UBI SOFT are morons doesn't give anyone the right to steal. As your Mom (or at least mine) used to say: two wrongs don't make a right!I am not opposed to simple DRM schemes (disk check, or even Steam which has established very good rapport gamers by being both consistent, fair, and show a long track record of stability). I am totally opposed to anything that PREVENTS ME FROM PLAYING THE GAME that I paid money for. I don't want to see this standardized (and I don't think it will be) and so it's time to take action NOW and refuse to buy this garbage.The bottom line is DRM is not and has never been about preventing piracy. It's about CONTROL. Control over you and how you are able to play the very game you paid your money for. It's about wrenching ownership away from the consumer and replacing it with something much lesser: rental \\ leasing. Don't let them do that to you.Final Thoughts:UBI SOFT and those like them have got to be taught a lesson. The only way to get heard by these huge companies is by hitting them where it hurts: their pocketbook. Refuse to buy this game or games like it that infringe on your rights. Tell your friends not to buy it. Write reviews that inform people about the risks of doing so. That's how you get things to change. To the inevitable trolls who will tell me that DRM should just be 'given in to,' I'd like to point out that currently game makers are MOVING AWAY from DRM schemes. The reason is because of the backlash against pointless restrictions by those like myself who are unwilling to sit around and watch PC gaming be ruined by greedy scumbags. It's because of grassroots action (Spore for example) that the tide has turned and that DRM is now much less common than it was a year ago. Top shelf games are being released DRM free. You know what? I've bought all of them and recommend you do the same. Let's all give our money to the makers of games that RESPECT us--after all, WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS. Enough said.\"", "I bought the game. Even though I HATE DRM. But I support and pay for games because I believe we must. But this game is exactly why my friends on and offline steal games. This DRM is brutal, especially since the quality of the game itself is not even that great to begin with!Repetition and not much new compared to the first AC. Ubisoft is milking the hot name to drain your wallet. Congrats Ubisoft...you suckered me good. This is the last time.I am sick of BUYING something only to find out I am really just renting it! You want to own UBISOFT? Then charge me $10 for the limitations I have to suffer with!!!!!!! From now on, I think I am going to borrow UBISOFT titles from friends. I will continue to pay for other titles. Ubisoft is on my list now.I am tired of being an adult that has been gaming since Wolfenstein 3D on my x386 PC only to continue to be punished and abused like a child.Shame on you UBISOFT! Drop the DRM BS. Get your heads of out of your A**es and start focusing on the quality!", "Yes yes we've all heard about the DRM issue everywhere, so I'll spare you the big rant. I will say that despite my displeasure with it, the game only cut out on me once to date. So, while I disagree with this type of DRM, it didn't prevent me from playing the game.In terms of gameplay, Assassin's Creed 2 is much better than the first one. The story is great but the gameplay is so much more fun. There are many more things to do in the cities and the new armor/health system coupled with the notoriety system forces you to be more careful with attacking guards all day (which can be fun).I can't say I remember one dull moment in the game, it was a blast to play. It is no longer the repetitive borefest that plagued the first game. Also, you can now fight with your (dual!) hidden blades!There is now a money system that allows you to buy new weapons, armor, and other things, and while that adds an interesting dimension to the game, I found that by halfway through the game I had so much money that I had purchased everything I could and had nothing to do with it. If money was more scarce or there were more things to buy it would have added to the difficulty of the game.I have no regrets getting this game, I got it on sale and had a blast playing it. Don't let the bad DRM prevent you from a great gaming experience.", "\"Well the reason i hate pc gaming now is all the bugs, clitches, DRM, Securom, having to download games now rather than pic them up at gamestop, and all the other garbage that goes along with copying games. I must admit i have downloaded a few in my time but i realized its just not worth it when you can purchase it and \"\"attempt\"\" to enjoy it from the store. Gamestop doesnt even sell PC games anymore, Best Buy is about the only place to find them. The main reason for its demise is that people never know when to stop finding ways to get around the games copy them for free and share them with everyone else. If people werent so lazy and cheap they would have jobs and go purchase games like real adult should. Music is a different story, CD sales may be suffering because of MP3 downloaded but thats because people want them because you just download it from here, or even for free. And no musicians are suffering or walking the streets broke because of it, they make there money on touring anyways. So back to computer gaming, the DRM, and Securom you find on most games doesn't even really effect how the game plays and with windows seven doesnt really slow down or damage anything at all on your PC. In my experience i only have one case when playing Dead Space, that it wiped out all of my songs from my hard drive because most i had downloaded through the years using Soulseek, a free download service. A game is worth paying for, to me, if you like it buy it, and play it. Music is different because people don't want to buy a cd that sucks or has 3 good song and then let it sit on the shelf and collect dust for years. I agree there are some shady deals gong down with having to be on the net, and spyware and actual viruses being put on games. The only hope you really have is don't order it but download it from direct2drive, or gamersgate, where is 90% of cases the DRM or Securom is removed because there is NO way it can be copied or burnt to disc. But as i said the reason for this is peoples dishonesty and just having to copy the game and then try to take it back or just share it with 100's of other people. Movies are slowly but surely dying as well with Netflix, Xbox Zune Videos, and PS3 Network. Its a shame but we live in a digital world now, and we have made it that way. So given that we have the ability and computer distributors knew burners had the means to do it, we have ourselves and also them to blame. Thanks Microsoft for ruining what use to be a thriving market. Now look at all the horrid reviews on 85% of PC games.Btw, the game itself is great and much better than the first, but no one else is bring that up and they are just ranting about the DRM and having to have internet to play, so i thought i would rant also.
