On the website they show people break dancing and they don't fall out. Well I don't breakdance but I doubt I could get these off my ears with my normal activity.Soundwise I compared them with my apple ear buds, Sandisk ear buds and my sennheiser HD-202 over the ear phones. To my ears they were louder and clearer than the stock apple ear buds. Sounded much better than the Sandisk ear buds and came close to the Sennheisers. That makes them very adequate for on the go listening and a great value. They are very light weight so I imagine I can wear them for hours no problem.", "A few months ago I acquired a pair of Etymotics earphones that list for about $180.  While I appreciated their sound quality, I could never get quite comfortable with them - the plastic ear buds didn't fit my ears, so I had to use the foam pads which must be jammed into the ear canal.  When I tried these Coosh earphones on, it was a completely different story.  These are probably the most comfortable earphones I've ever worn, and the earpiece keeps them on snugly. (They do include additional pieces to convert to a standard earbud design, if you don't like the wrap-around earpiece.)  The sound quality, at least to my ears,  is very good for the price, at least as good if not better than my iPod Classic earphones (and even more comfortable with their slightly oblong design). They may not beat the Etymotics for bass response, but at a little more than 1/10 the price, they're an excellent buy.  I've tried at least four different earphones since I got my iPod Classic, and now I think I've finally found my earphones of choice. Sorry, Etymotics.", "These headphones are one of my favorites because they don't have to go IN your ear. Even when wearing glasses, they fit nicely and stay in place.  I highly recommend these to people who hate putting ear buds in their ears.  I have small ears and these work great for me.", "Coosh Headphones (782048-B)I'm a pretty picky listener and I'm impressed. These earbuds sound really good! They are about the same size and shape as the iPod earbuds but, in my opinion, they sound better. They have an ultra-flexible, comfortable silicone ring that wraps snugly around the outside of your ear. This ring is very soft and keeps the earphones in place while exercising at the gym, while jogging and, surprisingly, while napping. These can be worn for hours without any discomfort whatsoever. Long airplane flights are no problem. Few earbuds that I have tried can come close to the Coosh headphones for comfort.For the price, they sound much better than you'd expect and while no earbuds are really of audiophile quality, these are really impressive. The silicone rings are removable so that the earbuds can be used by themselves - a thoughtful, but actually unnecessary feature. The headphones come packed in a nicely designed, clear cylindrical box that can be used for storage - important if the headphones are to be carried in a gym bag.These are so nice that I've sold several people on them in the past few days.  Highly recommended!", "I got this to replace my broken Apple earphones, that had been broken three times.I came across this on youtube, and took a chance in buying it.Sound quality is good; if you're very sensitive with what a song should sound like in a $600 headphones, then don't expect this one to produce that kind of sound.Its sound quality is equivalent to an Apple headset + comfy and hopefully last longer and doesn't break easily. MINIMUM SOUND LEAK too! in fact, almost none.The around ear silicon feature is really comfortable! CONCLUSION: This is a good earphones for everyday use..", "Got this recently.  The thing that wraps around the ear works fine.  It stays on the ear pretty well.  You can take the ear wrap-around off and use it like regular ear-piece.  In terms of the quality of the sound, it's ok.  Can't really tell difference between this earpiece and other pieces around the same price.", "I was interested in these earphones for reasons almost opposite of their designed purpose (wearing while active).I sometimes like to listen to a audio book or music or watch a movie on my iPod, PSP, or portable DVD player before going to sleep.Other earphones I've tried either fall out every time I turn over or even turn my head (Apple iPod basic earphones) or are really physically uncomfortable after a few hours if I fall asleep on my side while wearing them (Sony & Apple in-ear phones or B&O; earphones with the metal ear clips).I wanted something that would stay on while I was awake but not lead to sore ears if I fell asleep with them still on my ears.The Coosh 782048-B Headphones seem to do the job. I intentionally left them on a couple of nights and had no discomfort when I work up several hours later. In addition, they stayed in place while I was still awake and listening to them, even when I rolled over or turned my head on the pillow.Pros: Thoughtful design; they come with adapters for conversion to conventional earphones, an on-wire clip to pull the earphones together when not being worn (prevents the worst wire tangles), and another on-wire clip for holding the wire to itself if you wrap it around something like your iPod. Clever packaging; I'll keep the box to store them on my night stand.Cons: These are not audiophile earphones (but they don't pretend to be and are priced appropriately). A small round soft carrying case would have been nice; the silicone clips are removable by design and a case would make it less likely for them to disappear into the far reaches of a purse, pocket, or backpack.", "I'm always looking for good headphones for the gym.  So far nothing can beat my Sony EX-81 headphones. I got these in hopes that they would be better, but sadly, they are not.They are comfortable headphones, without a doubt. They stay in place while running which is a HUGE plus.  However, they do NOT block out any outside noise whatsoever, which really interferes with my listening. It makes my music sound like messy background noise. In addition, the sound quality is terrible, most likely because I can't hear my music due to all the background noise.These are good for small ears, but people with larger ears may need to look elsewhere.  They do not include different size inserts for the ear tips.All in all, I was disappointed in these headphones. Cheap price, but cheap sound. I guess you get what you pay for.", "\"I have two other brands of ear buds and both styles bother my ear after listening for only a short time.  That was the reason I was wanting to try something different.  COOSH surprised me with the level of lasting comfort of the soft silicone over the ear rings.  (I wish they would do this with the Bluetooth ear phone systems.)  The sound quality was perfect & I found myself closing my eyes and being at the concert I was listening to because the sound was so complete. The only thing that was of concern is loosing the bud caps (not that I think I will choose to use them) without a clip on the cable to click them in until wanted I will probally forget where I stored the bud caps.  Thanks COOSH for the preverbal \"\"new mouse trap\"\" I give it five stars.\"", "These are the best headphones if you don't want to spend a lot and if you don't like ear buds.  Have bought these three times.", "The Coosh headphones are earbuds with a soft silicon loop to keep them attached to your ears during physical exercise.  However, there really is nothing great about these things.Personally, I hate earbuds.  They don't really stay in my ear, and I find them to be uncomfortable.  This is especially the case with the iPod earbuds.  These Coosh earbuds have a slight silicon wrap on the outer edge of the buds, but that doesn't help the comfort level too much.  My ears still hurt after about 30 minutes of use.  The ear loop/hooks do a great job--they're surprisingly soft and keep the headphones on my ears during a jog on the treadmill. Still, the actual earbud part loosely pops out during a jog.The sound quality itself is exactly what the title of this review suggests.  It doesn't do anything horrible, but there's nothing here to be excited about either.  Sound quality is about what you'd expect from $20 earbuds, no more, no less.The redeeming qualities are the nice packaging container and the fact that the silicon is pretty easy to clean with some ethanol after working out.  I wanted to like these earbuds, but unfortunately, I cannot give them any glowing endorsement over any other headphones in the same price range.", "My earbuds are used every day, usually for 6-8 hours. My Ipod is my life's soundtrack. I have had problems with inexpoensive buds which fall out of the ears, which means yoiu have to boost the volume (leading to distortion, of course, and loss of bass). I thought these might do the trick, but alas, they too tend to fall out, and I needed to have the volume up enough so that the next office could hear them. Of course, at the price, it's what one could expect.", "To keep it simple, I have problems keeping ear buds in my ears. They just don't want to stay in. Furthermore, they don't seat properly so the bass response is greatly reduced.These headphones are made of two parts; the earbuds themselves, which are attached to a silicon loop that fits around the ears. You can remove the loop and use them as just earbuds if you prefer.The earbuds are of equivalent quality to Apple's own earbuds, which is to say that they are not bad at all. Perhaps even a little fuller bass. The cord is rubberized and a little grippy, and has integral cable management to shorten the cord (for a workout, etc), and a clip for the headphone cord. The plug is tapered to fit devices with recessed connectors -- such as the 1st generation headphone -- a nice touch.I wore these for a couple of days, and found that they definitely say in place better than earbuds by themselves. However, I wear glasses, so while the floppy silicon loop fits around my ear quite well, the headphones themselves had a habit of working themselves out of my ear during a brisk walk - on the other hand, they worked just fine on the elliptical trainer.They sound fine, may fit your ears great, but they didn't quite work for me.", "UPDATED 2/18/2009: Just a few short months after owning these headphones and using them as regularly as any other pair I've owned, the rubbery portion covering where the wires enter the jack simply broke off.  Now with exposed wires, I'll need to toss these and get a new pair (another brand).  It's a shame.Original review:As of late I've taken up running and I was in the market for a new pair of earbuds with over the ear holders.These seem like the perfect find.While they are over the ear part is comfortable and the sound quality decent, I am disappointed with one very big thing:The buds don't like to stay in my ear.By this I mean, as I workout and sweat, the cooshy party around the actually bud slips with the moisture.  This appears to be more of a problem with one ear than the other.  The up side is I do have the over the ear portion to keep the bud near my earhole at least, but then this compromises the sound quality/experience.I suppose it will help me from going deaf though.In the end, these are pretty average earbuds.Pros:- Comfortable over the ear holders- Ear holders removable AND there are these little rubbery bits to put in place at the straight end base of the earbuds so the cord doesn't get weird.- Comes with a little clip (also removable) in case you don't like your cord swinging all over the place.Con:- Earbuds don't stay secure.  O-kay with holders in place, but without them it's a real problem.", "\"I was looking forward to a nice set of ear phones that would stay in my ear, fit great, not annoy me, and offer decent audio quality while I'm out running or working out.The phones look great, pretty stylish, the audio quality is decent, however it fails on the whole \"\"stay in my ear and not annoy me front\"\".Not sure why, but they fit perfectly in my left ear, but they wont stay in my right ear for no more than a minute at most causing constant interruptions.I was trying these out while doing some plyometric training last saturday (jumping, going down on the floor, getting back up, kicking, etc) and the headphones did NOT fall off my ear (even though my ear was incredibly wet with sweat).However, the actual ear piece that goes in your ear would NOT stay in on my right ear (the left stayed much longer, but it eventually fell out after a while).This would not be such a bad thing, but the ear piece falls out way to fast.I tried listening to my ipod at home with the phones and the same thing happened here, the right ear just falls out.Maybe there is just a quality issue involved here, I'm not sure, but all in all these phones could be better.  If the ear piece just stayed in for 10 minutes, they would of gotten 5 stars.I don't think anyone would buy these phones just to listen to music, the goal is for them to stay in your ear during an active workout, and on that front these phones fail to measure up (not a complete failure, but I'm sure you can do better).I use another brand of sport headphones that go around the back of your head, and they stay in (but hurt my ear like you wouldn't believe) which is why I was wanting this pair to work.Maybe next time.\"", "\"My initial review is below, but unfortunately these headphones didn't live up to my original expectations. Although the sound is indeed quite good, and the headphones are very comfortable, the buds themselves tend to work their way out of my ears and need to be repositioned occasionally. These may be a good choice for light activity, but with significant motion they become a bit less effective. I would revise my review to three stars if I could.-----There are not many products that win me over across the board, but these Coosh headphones certainly did. I've tried all kinds of earbuds, including some pricy German ones, trying to find a set that sounds decent, stays put, and doesn't hurt my ears. I'm happy to have found these; they are now my 'buds of choice.These headphones have pretty much everything I'd expect: good sound, a collar clip, a slider that adjusts wire \"\"Y\"\", etc. There is no inline volume control but I prefer it that way because exercise tends to affect those volume sliders. No negatives. Great headphones!\"", "First, I will state that if you are simply looking for a comfortable pair of earphones, then this is a great choice.  They are very light and it almost feels like you have nothing on.  The sound is very full - good bass, good treble, good midrange.The only problem is the fact they actual speaker does not stay in your ear.  Unfortunately that is a pretty big problem since these seem to be intended for use while you're moving around.If you are a runner, these are definitely out of the question.  You are much better off with something in the Sony Active line.  While the silicone hoop stays over your ear, the bud bounces in and out as your body moves.  Ultimately this leads to a terrible music experience.Overall, this is a good option if you have trouble with headphones staying secure when you are sedentary.  Just don't waste your money if you are looking for something to work with an active lifestyle.Pros- Sound is great for the size- Comfort is great.  Your ear doesn't feel plugged and you don't feel the weight- Size: not so big that it looks stupid on your earsCons- Fit is not secure enough for heavy activity", "\"In the last 25 years I have owned many, many, pair of headphones, purchased for use with various music players--radios, cassette players, CD players, and now MP3 players.  Their flaws fell into three categories: either they were uncomfortable,  they didn't stay put, or the audio quality was terrible.It should, therefore, be no surprise that I was skeptical about the coosh's claim to \"\"stay on and feel good\"\", but they are light, and the silicone ring keeps them where they belong without being annoying, even during physical activity. While I use the MP3 player for spoken word recordings (listening to NPR and other podcasts) the sound quality seems excellent.Listening to headphones when you exercise outdoors is not, in my opinion, a safe activity, but these headphones will stay put if you choose to do it.\"", "I didn't like these that much. The ear strap was too big and too rubbery that it didn't allow for the earbuds to stay securely in my ear. The sound was pretty decent, but I didn't get to enjoy then that much because I kept trying to get them to stay in my ears.", "\"Like many music lovers who have tried headphones and earplugs, I've never found a set that fit my ears comfortably. So after 20 minutes or so of listening, regardless of the intrinsic quality of the headphones, fatigue sets in and enjoyment of the music is attenuated or worse. Large headphones are soon uncomfortable, and earplugs become painful with time while their sound is usually tinny and weak.I tried the Coosh Headphones out of sonic desperation. The first surprise was that they are really \"\"Headphones\"\". They fit comfortably in front of the ears and not in them. The lightweight rubber ear pieces that support the tiny speakers sit behind the ears. They are soft and light - so soft and light that I could barely feel them there. Fatigue never sets in. Even after lengthy listening. The sound quality of these headphones is quite good: clear, crisp and with sufficient bass response for my kind of music, which is usually Classical and Jazz. Rock listeners might need to boost the bass a bit. The Coosh Headphones are probably the best option currently available for those who find listening with headphones or earplugs to be a painful experience.\"", "I'm almost embarrassed to write this review, because I feel really foolish to admit that I paid $160 for the Bang and Olufsen headphones these replaced - and these are better in so many ways.  But in my defense, these weren't available when I bought the Bang and Olufsens.Let's face it, the stock headphones that come with an iPod are marginal at best.  The sound is okay, but they don't stay in the ears very well when worn during strenuous exercise.  The Coosh headphones are very comfortable and stay put during strenuous exercise and sound every bit as good or better than the stock iPod phones.  And I must admit that they are much more comfortable than the $160 Bang and Olufsens.The bottom line - you just can buy a better set of headphones for $20 than the Coosh.  They could double the price and these headphones would still be a bargain.", "All the earbuds I've tried before these were abysmal.  Either the sound was terrible or I couldn't keep them in my ears; usually both.  The Coosh headphones are terrific.  The soft, very flexible silicone earpieces hold the earbuds in place in your ears, and the sound quality is phenomenal.  They're so comfortable, you forget you have them on, but they stay right where you place them.  Just a warning--turn down your sound the first time you use them.  I found that I only needed the sound set to a very low level in order to hear at normal loudness.  I even like the clear round acrylic box they come in, because it's easy to store them in it, and I can find it when I want to.  I love these, and I recommend them to all the frustrated earbud users.", "As most of the other reviewers noted, the package is pretty cool, and sturdy enough to store them in. The buds fit well, and the soft gel of the outer ring that holds them onto your ears is so light weight, you will forget you have them on.My main complaint with earbuds is basically I don't like them. Don't want to stick something in my ear for one thing, and hoping they stay there gets old. These take care of that by holding them gently, yet firmly where they need to be, right AT your ear canal, not IN them.The sound is far superior to the buds that come with most mp3 players. I have never tried Ipod, so can't say how they compare to those sound wise. But they beat the heck out of the ones that came with my Centon 3 gig mp3 player.You get a decent enough range of sound, lacking a little in the lows, but that's to be expected with these type of speakers. If you really want the bass, gonna need over the ear headset in my opinion.All in all a great set of mobile speakers that definitely DON'T put a hurtin on your ears, or pocketbook either.", "Let me start by saying I thought these were going to be junk when I first saw them, but then I tried them on and I was pretty impressed. My only comparison are my Etymotics which are the best I have ever heard, but also cost about $300. For 10% of that price you can have these. I have to say I do not like ear buds because they just fall off. These stay on. Even my Etymotics can come off relatively easily. Of course, these are heavier, but not by that much. These are perfect for out of the house, where if you lose them, you are not out $300 or so....but, keep in mind that if you lose these you will not be happy. You can easily get used to these and I find that I don't mind wearing them. These are NOT noise cancelling. Knowing this, you cannot expect to immerse yourself into your music in any environment. However, you will also be able to hear if someone is speaking to you (unless you make the music so loud that it is dangerous). I wouldn't recommend driving with these, nor would they serve you well on an airplane, but in the house, when you still need to hear the phone ring, or some such situation, everything is fine. Bass is a bit weak, but not unexpected with this kind of headphone. These seem flimsy, BUT, my Etymotics do also, and I have had them for a long time with no problem. I cannot comment on the longevity yet, but if something breaks, reast assured I will update this review.For those who want  the short version, here it is:These cost 10% of what my Etymotics cost, and give you at least 80% back. That right there makes these a no brainer.Why not 5 stars? You really need to listen to a pair of top of the line Etymotics to understand. Keep in mind that I would give the buds that I got with my iTouch 3 stars (in case that helps you as a point of reference).", "\"Prior to the Coosh Headphones, I had been using a pair of Skullcandy Buds Ink'd Earbuds - Dark Gray with mySanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)(general use) andApple iPod shuffle 1 GB Silver (2nd Generation)(workout use).  I have two things that I am looking for use with the Clip - sound quality (although I don't have the highest or most technical standards) and comfort.  For the iPod I have slightly different priorities - secure fit, comfort, and sound quality.  Based on usage with both players, I discuss which - if any - of these uses are a good match for the Coosh Headphones.My experience using the Coosh Headphones with my Clip was very positive.  Compared to the Ink'd Earbuds, the sound quality of the Coosh Headphones was noticeably clearer.  I listened to a variety of music from Metallica to Susan Tedeschi to Glenn Campbell.  I found it easy to hear the different layers in songs from the obvious vocals, guitars, and drums, to the more subtle instruments such as background strings, chimes, and piano.  I also had a specific song that I was disappointed with the Ink'd Earbuds performance - \"\"Enemy\"\" from the CD Days of the New II.  At low volumes, the opening bass line was not very distinguished; however, the Coosh Headphones did not have this problem.  So the Coosh wins in sound quality.To my surprise, comfort was an easy win for the Coosh Headphones.  Even with the ear clips attached I listened to my Clip for over an hour, and I hardly noticed that I had them on thanks to the soft, bendable material.  That's really the best thing you can say for the comfort of headphones is if you don't notice them.  The Ink'd Earbuds are not bad, but I never forget that I'm wearing them.  I also tested the Coosh Headphones with the earbud plugs rather than the ear clips, but I found that they tended to fall out of my ear after extended usage.  However with the clips as comfortable as they are, the only reason one would consider removing them is for style.On the other hand, I did encounter one area with the Coosh Headphones where they failed miserably.  I was using them at the gym last night with my iPod, and I cannot recommend them for active use.  Once I got the treadmill up to 7.0 mph, the speakers no longer stayed in my ear.  While they did not entirely fall off, they might as well have.  I could no longer hear the music.  I will be sticking with the Ink'd Earbuds for use while jogging.Overall, the Coosh Headphones are nice for some circumstances.  Anyone looking for a reasonable priced pair of headphones to use at the office, coffee shop, or anyplace else where you are stationary should give these a try.  The sound quality is good as far as this average Joe is concerned, and the comfort is the best that I've come across so far.  Joggers or other active users should consider an alternative.\"", "This review is for the Coosh headphones white.I must admit that a lot of engineering has been put into these headphones including the box cover and packing materials that comes along with the product, I was pleasantly surprised with the comfort and ease in which these headphones sits in the ear.Now bear it in mind that these are designed for active people who may use this while jogging or doing exercise and thus compensating for not so good sound quality. If you are an audiophile and expect deep bass and full range of sounds coming out of these headphones then look elsewhere.PROS:(+) Very well designed for comfort and will not hurt your ears while jogging or exercising.(+) Silicon and rubbery soft feeling for all the components of the headphone including the plug!(+) Has a conversation kit that makes these headphones into regular ear budsCONS:(-) Not for Audiophiles, It lacks deep bass, Mids and Highs are okay(-) Longevity may be an issue as the silicon material may eventually become sticky?For $20 these are decent quality headphones which can be used with IPOD and other portable players and these are intended for people who live a active lifestyle which includes running and jogging.", "\"Five OUTSTANDING Stars!! 'ON the ear, not IN the ear'. COOSH Headset & Headphones are among the very best headphones that I have used, including my previous favorites: the earbuds that come with iPods. The 'high end' soft, comfortable 'ear ring' headsets, within which the ear buds are mounted, hook over the ear from front to back, self-adjusting to any ear shape, and do not bind on the ear. The ear buds hover over the ear canal, not in it. The ear rings can be removed and the buds converted, using rigid bud caps, to be pushed into the outer ear canal area, if desired.The sound reproduced is as good as any I have used, delivering the full audible sound spectrum from 65 Hz to 20 kHz (voice frequency is from 300 to 3500 Hz) with rich bass bottom notes and non-shrill high notes realistically. I gave these the acid test using a performance of an acoustical guitar jazz trio, a full symphony orchestra, a classical duo, and high note trumpet wizard Jon Faddis playing \"\"Things to come\"\": these 'babies' are amazing. On Paula Cole's \"\"Hard to Be Soft\"\", these phones reveals exactly what the percusssionist is doing and timbre of Ivan Lins' voice.They deliver the  sound of a violin and cello showing every nuance and vibrato reverberation and you can sometimes actually hear the musician inhaling. Great headset/Headphones!! My Highest Recommendation. Five HUGE Stars!! (Ear phones/headset, plastic case, two conversions plugs)\"", "\"I have now used these Coosh earbuds for 5 days and have listened to various types of music as well as podcasts and radio through both my iPod Nano and MacBook while comparing them to the original iPod earbuds.  I currently own a pair of Bose in ear headphones as well as QC3 and have owned earbuds from Sennheiser and Shure in the past.  I have been looking for a pair of high quality earbuds with depth and full quality sound while also being comfortable and staying on the ear during exercise.  These would not be the pair, but they do have advantages:+Price:  I believe these are priced lower than a replacement pair of iPod earbuds, so if yours are lost, I'm not sure you are going to find anything better in this price range.+Comfort:  These feel good on your ears.+Design:  No matter how large or small your ears are, these will stay on and you will not have a problem with them popping out or being fearful that it will happen.  This is probably the biggest advantage of this pair of headphones.+The cord is a good length.  The iPod earbuds are too short while the Bose in ear are too long.  These are just right.+Clip to connect to your collar so the cord will not flop around.+Cord is made of heavier plastic than iPod earbuds so it winds easier and more seamless while not feeling as \"\"Tangly.\"\"-By all measures that I reviewed the sound quality is not even as good as the iPod earbuds.  If you are looking for full crisp sound, these are not for you.  The sound is not bad, it just does not provide anything special.-The design is great, but they do look a bit weird, like you are wearing a hearing aid...but they stay on.I listen to mostly podcasts when I walk my dog and run, so these are perfect for me because sound quality is not a huge issue due to my Bose headphones for when I am stationary or on a plane.  If you are active, want something that will stay on your ears and also want a great price point-I cannot image a better product than this (for $20) but don't expect to get $50 or $80 dollar sound quality.\"", "The Coosh headphones are very similar to the factory issued iPod headphones with three major exceptions:1. Wrap Around Ear Buds:  These ear buds insert just like the normal kind but have a rubber wrap around for the ear to better keep your buds in place.  One major draw back for me is that I wear glasses some of the time and wearing them both can make it more likely that the ear bud will fall out.2. Longer Wire:  This is a nice feature because some of my pants have deep pockets putting a strain on regular wires.  And when you don't need the extra length, there is a cinch that can shorten it up.  On the downside longer wires mean more, and tougher tangles.3. A Clip:  I cannot count the number of times my ear buds get yanked out because the wire gets caught on something as I pass by.  The clip keeps the wire close to you lowering the chances of it gets caught on anything.So the Coosh is a slight upgrade from what you received with your iPod so if you are extremely annoyed with your buds getting ripped out, these are for you.  But if you wear glasses you may want to look for something else.", "\"These are a cute little pair of headphones that someone spent a lot of time thinking about. The sound quality is on par with your standard bud headphones but the way they mount in your ear is what sets these apart. They are designed for flexibility.OverviewImagine your standard white I-pod bud earphones. Now if you look at the base of each bud where the wire goes in there is usually some type of rubber stopper or crimp to hold the wire into the bud. These are different in that they don't have that crimp. Instead the hole leading up to the bud is larger and more open. This allows for an insert.The main insert is a silicone rubber loop that plugs into that channel (securing the wire going into the bud). This rubber loop is very soft and flexible and fits around the part of your ear that glasses hang onto (it actually loops around further). The end result of this is that the earbud is held very securely, and comfortably in place by this rubber loop. Its defiantly more comfortable than other solutions I've used like headbands and other methods of ear clips. So for innovative and comfortable mounting I'll give it to them. Works well for exercise. These are defiantly my new standard jogging headphones.If you don't want the loop you can \"\"unplug\"\" it from the earbud and replace it with the included small rubber splints that secure the wire in the bud. This would turn them into more or less normal earbuds.In addition to the loops the headphones also come with a little clip attached so you can clip them to your shirt so the cord won't flop around while you exercise. Also at the part where the headphones \"\"Y\"\" there is a slider there to reduce the amount of cord in the upper part of the Y (by forcing the split point further up and closer to the buds) to cut the slack there.The plug itself is one of the 90 degree varieties with the usual amount of reinforcement. As far as thickness and build it is on par with Ipod buds.So how do they sound? Nothing exceptional there. Their sound quality is on par with the standard Ipod earbuds. They get the job done but there is better stuff out there if your willing to pay.SoProsInnovative fit. Designed for exerciseComfortableConsNone really for its class.ConclusionIf your looking for a decent pair of earbud headphones these offer a lot of flexibility. Especially for active use.\"", "\"First off, allow me to provide some definitions I humbly consider standard when discussing headphones / earphones / earbuds if for no other reason than to define how I am using these terms in my review.  I have been on a lifelong (OK, really, only for the last seven years or so since I was an early adopter of the first iPod model) quest for the \"\"perfect\"\" mobile solution for iPod / MP3 player listening, and have found that there is some general confusion about these terms:Headphones - these are traditional, around-the-ear (circumaural) or over-the-ear (supra-aural) units.  They, generally speaking, have the best sound quality but are the least portable; i.e., not good for jogging, etc.Earphones - these are in-the-ear units; i.e., they fit inside the outer ear canal.  Think earplugs but wired for sound.  They can be super-comfortable, can offer very good sound-quality and are highly portable.  But, since they are extremely effective at blocking out external sounds, they can be dangerous for use while jogging.Earbuds - these are the units shaped like little mushrooms, if you will, and are intended to rest in the outer ear cavity just outside of the entrance to the ear canal.  They can offer decent sound quality and, since they let in some measure of external noise (depending on the volume of the music being played), they are probably the best choice for jogging, walking, etc. around traffic.  However, depending on the shape of an individual's ears, they can be uncomfortable at best, or fail to stay in the ear at all at worst, especially when physically active.  I have seen estimates (not based  on any real scientific analysis, mind you) that up to 10 - 15% of the population has ear shapes not suited to standard earbuds.OK, now having gotten that out of the way, based on these definitions, these Coosh units are obviously earbuds.  In my listening tests, I compared them to a \"\"stock\"\" pair of Apple iPod earbuds (the ones that come with the iPod), a pair of on-the-ear, noise-reducing headphones by AWG (model K28NC), and my \"\"gold standard\"\" headphones for indoor, stationary iPod listening, a pair of Grado Labs SR60s.  I included this last pair for sound quality comparisons only - they are not suited for use while exercising.  Neither are the AKGs in my opinion, but I use these a lot at school & therefore included them as well for sound quality comparison purposes.  All listening was done on an Apple iPod, listening to music encoded at 256 kbps (very good, but not CD, quality).First comparison - sound quality.  I rank these 4 sets of 'phones / 'buds in the following order, best to worst:Grado SR60sAKG K28NCApple iPod EarbudsThese Coosh EarbudsSome may be asking, why 4 stars if these Coosh earbuds ranked last in sound quality?  A fair question, and something I struggled with regarding the number of stars I awarded.  I was torn between 3 stars and 4 stars, but decided in the end to compare these Coosh earbuds only to other earbuds.  Traditional headphones have an inherent advantage in sound quality I believe and therefore can not be compared directly to earbuds.  So compared primarily to the Apple iPod earbuds, these ranked 4 stars to me based on slightly lower sound quality but vastly superior comfort and fit, particularly while exercising.Compared to the Apple iPod earbuds, these Coosh earbuds were slightly lacking in bass (with both units, like all earbuds, this depended on how tightly wedged in the outer ear the 'buds are).  As a result, the Coosh 'buds were a little \"\"brighter\"\" sounding.  They also did not get quite as loud as the Apple 'buds.  But, all this considered, the Coosh 'buds were only marginally inferior to the Apple 'buds in the sound quality department.Now, where these Coosh 'buds shined compared to the Apple 'buds was in comfort and fit.  I am one of the minority of people whose outer ear shape does not conform well to earbuds in general.  I have never used the 'buds that come with Apple iPods because they are uncomfortable to me & do not stay in my ear - especially when exercising.  These Coosh 'buds, while being the same shape & size as the Apple 'buds, have the advantage of their ear \"\"hooks\"\" which fit around the ear, keeping the buds in place without relying on their being wedged into place in the outer ear itself.  These hooks are made of very lightweight and soft silicone - so soft & lightweight that I soon forget they are even hooked around my ears.  And they stay in place much better than the Apple earbuds during physical activity.A couple of asides - one, the silicone ear hooks can be removed & then these can be used as \"\"normal\"\" earbuds.  Included are two small silicone adapters that route the wires properly out of the base of each 'bud with the ear hooks removed.  Second, these do not come with foam 'bud covers like iPod earbuds, but since these buds are virtually identical in size, you can use the foam covers from a set of iPod earbuds on these Coosh earbuds, or order after market covers that are meant to fit iPod earbuds.I apologize for the long review but music, and equipment for listening to music, are my passions.  Bottom line?  If you are looking for a pair of comfortable earbuds for use while exercising outdoors that have acceptable sound quality, are comfortable to wear and allow a measure of external noise in (safety first!), I would recommend these Coosh earbuds without hesitation.  Especially if you find other earbuds uncomfortable or unusable due to lack of fit.\"", "Got it off one of those daily deal websites, forgot which one.Totally didn't expect it came with mic.
