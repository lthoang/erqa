"], "reviews": ["\"Not too bad in price, and a nice size tube for packing along with your sun block and bug spray this summer.A nice clean aroma, but not overpowering.It didn't have the cool \"\"sting\"\" of the aloe gels, and Solarcaine type products I have tried, and was not as much of an analgesic as those either I thought.However, the rich blend of ingredients helps the skin heal fast, I got some red shoulders camping that had calmed down in two days with this stuff, and I didn't peel either - and I always peel!Definitely will be a summer essential for me - 5 stars\"", "This product arrived just in time to treat a sunburn.  I feel it did help treat it.  It still took a few days for sunburn to go away but with use of this product it didnt hurt.  The product has a slight pleasant scent.  It is not astringent.  It looks and feels like a gel.", "My recent HS graduate son spent several days Lake Meade wake boarding with friends.  He tans up nicely, but by the time the trip was over he'd gotten WAY too much sun.  The down side is that he then needed to start a job as a swimming instructor and life guard = lots more sun.At about the same time my college-aged daughter got a burn of her own, so they both started using this sunburn treatment.  My daughter initially reported that it didn't really do much for her, but by the 2nd or 3rd day she changed her mind.  My son, who also used it, started showing signs of recovery from his overdose of sunlight.Don't expect immediate results if you get this product, but continued use yields positive results.All in all 4 stars.", "\"This sun burn gel is easily absorbed by the skin and feels non-greasy when rubbed in.  I didn't notice a scent so you won't smell like you have \"\"medicine\"\" on.  It has a cool feeling going on and then you don't notice it once it is absorbed by your skin.\"", "I usually use aloe vera for sunburn, but it's difficult to find in a small-easy-to-apply tube like this one.  Furthermore, although aloe vera is a natural product, it can be sticky and take time to dry on the skin.Sunburnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief has several advantages.  As noted, it comes in a convenient tube, making it easy to through in a beach bag as well as good for long-term storage.  (My aloe vera was in a clear bottle, which I think contributed to product deterioration over time.)  There is no discernible scent to this product.  Furthermore, although it does contain aloe vera, it goes on smooth, with no apparent stickiness, and it dries quite quickly.So far, I have not had occasion to use this product for a sunburn (this is a good thing!).  However, I am VERY glad to have in on hand, and I plan to try it for uses that other reviewers have mentioned, such as insect bites.  I will update my review as I obtain more information, but so far, I would recommend this product.UPDATE 9/3/12:  Yesterday I sustained a small burn on one finger while ironing, so I decided to try this product.  It immediately produced a cooling, soothing sensation, and the burn did not bother me again until my hand was under warm water in the shower.  By today, the burn is already healing nicely.  Therefore, it does seem like this product is effective in these situations, and I maintain my recommendation.", "The gel in the container does a decent job of being soothing. Given that it doesn't really contain active ingredients, it's really tough to take a guess at how much of any effect that seems to appear is just the normal healing process in action that would have happened anyway. The good news about this is that it's unlikely to do any harm to give it a shot and see if you're happy with it.I mostly wish that they were declaring in the product name or the primary product features that it's intended to be a homeopathic remedy. That's a pretty major detail in helping people to decide whether to buy or not, and I think it should be much more front and center in the marketing than it is. (It is in the product description and on the label, however.)", "\"As a pale skinned Woman who lives in Florida, I have tried just about every \"\"after sun\"\" product out there. I generally prefer the ones with menthol since they have a cooling effect. SunBurnt has Calendula Officinalis Q, Cantharis Vesicatoria 3x and Echinacea Angustifolia Q as it's active ingredients. It also contains Aloe. I am not familiar with all the active ingredients, but they are supposed to act as an antiseptic and promote rapid wound healing, treat burns & scalds and aid in healing burns & blisters.SunBurnt has a slight stinky scent when you first apply it that fades quickly. After seconds there is no scent left. The best part is that it is not sticky! Most of the after sun products I have used are really sticky afterwards and you have to wait to lay down or put clothes on. I always hate that wait; especially since I get chills with my sunburn. How does it work? It did give me a decent amount of sun relief. While it did not give me the strong cooling effect of products with menthol, it did give me a cooling effect. It made my skin feel better and moisturized. It also seemed to make my sunburn heal faster and it didn't peel as fast.I will use this product again. I am also wanting to try it on kitchen burns, but I am not willing to burn myself on purpose to try it. : ) This is definitely a great homeopathic alternative to other after sun products and is my new favorite since it isn't sticky.\"", "We have had an unusual year this year.  We started having 90 degree days way back in the spring time when we are usually struggling to break 60!  This has been cause for a lot of early sun exposure which has left skin a bit dried out and sun tired.Sunburnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief is an interesting product.  It comes in a flip top tube which is sealed with a pull tab seal.  The gel itself is a clear gel which has no odor at all.In applying to the skin, a dot of gel about the size of a large green pea will do my entire arm.  The gel is very cooling when I first put it on and the cooling sensation lasts for about a half hour, depending on the day.The gel soaks in very quickly, leaving the skin almost dry to the touch, but not dried out, if that makes any sense.  The skin has the feeling that it is moisturized, but it is not at all sticky or tacky feeling.  It feels like regular skin- like you didn't just put gel on it.Over a period of a week, I found that my skin didn't flake or peel at all, and it maintained a nice level of moisturizing without having to reapply constantly.  I only had to reapply a few times during the day.  It did relieve burned skin and seemed to encourage healing some too.  I didn't notice any significant pain reduction because the burn was not that bad, but I did see a quicker healing time than normal.  The key is to apply IMMEDIATELY after noticing a sun burn- that is highlighted in the instructions.I would purchase this to have in the house once I run out. It is nice to have around the house.  I would say that this would be good for burns on the skin that are not serious as well- even if they don't come from the sun, but the label does not say that.", "\"If you buy this product for nothing else but to keep in your medicine cabinets for the next burn that occurs in your house, then you've done well.  This product is just amazing - I'm always burning my forearms since I'm baking so much and this stuff really relieves the pain quickly.  It's just one of those \"\"finds\"\" that you come across now and then that works so well, that you just keep it on your shelf all the time like Advil.  Plus, it's amazing for relieving sunburn pain, it's original intent, especially on children.  The cooling effect relieves the pain faster than anything I've used besides toothpaste (there's a hint from Heloise there for you - I've been using toothpaste on bad burns for years and there's NOTHING that relieves the pain faster, that is until this stuff came out!).  But, what toothpaste DOESN'T do is reduces the color within minutes of a burn like this stuff does, and you can actually feel the hydration going into your skin!  The BEST part - if you're on a cruise or just going out to dinner after a long day in the sun, then you won't smell like your medicine cabinet if you use this product.  We all have very light, sensitive skin and this stuff has proven to be amazing.Give this a try and keep it in your medicine cabinet for sunburns but every other burn too.  And honestly, don't believe the skin peeling thing - once your skin has been burned, chances are quite high that IT'S GOING TO PEEL SINCE IT'S DEAD, unless it's just a light burn.  A heavy burn, well, again, it's dead so you need to get it off anyway.  If you want to recondition your skin and reduce the effects of scarring, rub in some Vitamin E oil - I had a hand surgeon tell me that Vitamin E oil will reduce internal scarring of tissue and it's amazing on skin restoration after a burn.  That's what they used on my feet after I obtained sun poisoning at the beach one year.  Afterwards, I had NO sensitivity, no scarring and no aftermath.  Great, great stuff, highly recommend!\"", "Seems like this is basically Aloe Vera plus a bunch of ingredients that maybe will or won't help.  With homeopathic remidies, none of this stuff is regulated so it'd kid of hit or miss.$9 is an awful lot to pay for something that is basically $2 worth of aloe vera and $7 worth of hopes and dreams...", "Getting sunburned is a drag and it's so bad for you. But if you get burned and need quick relief, this creme is perfect. I've used other aloe-based gels before, and they're always very sticky. This gel goes on clear and smooth and doesn't remain too sticky.This gel scores well on all of my criteria:* Relieves the pain* Doesn't stink* Isn't messyWell done.And it's hard to tell from the photo and the 6oz measurement, but the tube is actually pretty large. If you're good about using sunscreen and don't burn too often, this container should last you for a few years.", "I had an opportunity to use this gel on some sun burnt skin and skin burnt my boiling water. The chilling effect did make the skin feel better - more calm and less flamed. But my skin still pilled off in a few days.", "I was a but skeptical about this product but I have actually become a fan of it after using it for my last minor sunburn. The product is clear and goes on a bit sticky but after it dries and you move around a bit, you no longer feel it. It really does seem to lesson the redness and ease the pain.The active ingredients are:Calendula Flower (Antiseptic, promotes wound healing)Cantharis Vesicatoria 3x (Treats burns and scalds)Echinacea Angustifolia (Coneflower)Root Extract (Aids in healing burns & blisters)Inactive Ingredients:Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice, Carbomer, Distilled Water, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium HydroxideNote: FOR BEST RESULTS, apply immediately after experiencing a sunburn. In other words, you're going to need some laying around for the summer rather than waiting to buy it to address a burn.", "\"I had occasion to use this the other day after taking my kids to the park. I put a sunblocker on my boys, but being in the direct sun at the park for an hour, they still got a little pink. My oldest was complaining about his skin feeling warm, so when we got home, I broke out the \"\"SunBurnt.\"\" His response immediately after applying it? \"\"It feels nice and cool, mommy.\"\" My little one was walking around saying, \"\"cool. cool.\"\" Big smiles all around. I can only take their word for it :) I don't know how well this would work on a severe sunburn, but for mild sun exposure, it decidedly does the trick!\"", "Living in SWFL fulltime, I look for a product that actually does what it says it will do. This product provided soothing coolness after a day at the water park, beach, and pool. I do have Mediterranean heritage skin so I don't burn easily. I don't know if this product would be just as effective on a person with a fairer complexion, but I certainly found it to be soothing.", "used this product on the grand sons after a day on the river.  even though they had sun screen on they still got a little red.  the youngest complained of the burning on the skin from too much sun on his arms.  we got home and put some of this on him.  the reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that it worked great on the grandson.  but a bigger tube would be alot better for more coverage and more people.", "Brought this product with us on our trip to Maui and it worked wonders.  At the end of each day in the sun, we applied it to our burnt areas and the burning feeling temporarily resided and we experienced no peeling skin! Provided hydration to dried out skin.", "Now that I no longer live in Southern California, my opportunities to burn aren't as high. But, this cream was useful over the Summer on our faces and arms. It doesn't have that too antiseptic-like smell that some after burn or post sunburn products have. I will use this cream again and suggest it to others.", "This little gem has been used quite abit this summer...especially after the beach. The little ones say it cools the skin very quickly and I have not noticed any peeling so its absolutely great for mild/medium burns. Definetly give this one a try.", "This came at the perfect time for me since I already had a painful sunburn on my back.  And after using if for a couple of days I would have to say that it's definitely one of my favorite sunburn remedies. It goes on cool and soothing and provided immediate pain relief, I also like the fact that it doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky and even more important doesn't contain a lot of chemicals.", "I've been using Aloe Vera gel for minor cooking burns and sunburn, and this tube looked very similar to the products I've bought in the past. Imagine my shock when I put it on my shoulders after I got a sunburn and I got no relief!  This felt nothing like the relief I had gotten from Aloe Vera gel in the past.I grabbed the tube and read the ingredients. I was shocked to discover that this was a homeopathic remedy --  I hadn't spotted anything about it being homeopathic on the label. I did see that there was some Aloe Vera in the tube, along with Calendula Flower and Coneflower extracts. The ingredients didn't say how much Aloe Vera was in the tube, nor did it say how much of the flower extracts were there.I fear that I am going to be in the minority and that most people will love this.  However, it didn't soothe my sore shoulders at all. I asked my husband to run to the store and grab some Aloe Vera gel, which he did - it provided the relief I had felt before. Because of that, I am giving this a less than wonderful review. I gave it three stars because it felt moisturizing when I tried it before I got a burn.", "On my five-year-old who came home with a sunburn two days ago.  It doesn't have some strange, horrible smell, it wasn't sticky or gooey, it went on really nicely, and you couldn't even see his sunburn the following morning!  I'm really impressed with it.  Granted he wasn't severely sunburned, it was light.  But he said it was hurting him, and I had just gotten this in the mail, and he said it felt good on his skin.  20 minutes later, he wasn't complaining about the pain at all!I will definitely buy some more of this product when we run out.  I think it's more effective and easier to apply and use than so many other after sun/aloe vera treatments I've tried.Love it!", "My 9 year old is very fair skinned so I usually slather her with sun screen when she's going to be exposed but, for the first day of summer school at a new school, I completely forgot. I felt so bad when she came home with bright pink spots on the back of her neck and on her arms. She kept complaining about how hot her skin was and worrying it was going to peel and itch and make her sick later on. I had the brand new unopened tube of Sunburnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief and was I ever relieved myself when she immediately said her skin didn't feel so hot anymore. She even liked the smell and the way it felt going on. Within a short time she'd forgotten all about worrying about her sunburn - and by the next morning the redness was gone! Even on my normally very pale child! This cream is great!", "We brought this product with us on vacation to cape cod. We used it quite frequently to relieve sunburn. Found that the product responded very fast and lasted especially when applied before bed. Does not leave a greasy film  and has a nice mild scent.", "I tested this on the ultimate sunburn king, my 21-year-old son who works outside at a golf course over the summer. He gives this After Sun Relief productstwo thumbs up. He said his skin is not peeling, even one patch on his shoulder that had looked like it would blister and peel. His skin is soft, smooth and doesn't hurt from the sunburn. He had been using aloe gel from the dollar store, and this is much more soothing and much more effective. He likes it a lot.Recommendation: Definitely, two soothed, non-peeling thumbs up.", "My sister got a moderate sun burn after exposing her skin to sunlight for a good couple of hours. Her skin became redder and it started to irritate her. She felt the sever burn feeling on her face. It didn't go away the next day. Suddenly, I remembered that I got this sun burnt cream, so I asked her to give it a try. Wonderfully, after applying the cream the first time, the symptoms were relieved significantly. On the second day of usage, she felt so much better and all the burning feelings had almost disappeared. She totally recovered by the 3rd day of usage. I would recommend you to have this in your house. It's really useful when the time comes.", "The aloe in this gel will sooth most types of first degree burns.  When you're ouchy, the cooling effect this gel delivers is a welcome relief.  The consistency is quite nice - not too thick, not too thin.  It doesn't take an age to rub it in, which can be important since burns tend to be sensitive.  The smell is pleasant with no lingering after-odor.  The active ingredients include Cantharis, Calendula and Echinacea.", "I sat in bleachers at a parade for several hours recently with the sun beaming on the back of my neck. When I got home I felt it. Enter Sunburnt After Sun Relief. I rubbed this lotion on and no burning sensation at all. It also did not feel like I had lotion on at all; no overpowering smell and not greasy. This is a great product to have around for the summer, especially for those that spend lots of time outdoors, at the beach, golfing, or whatever. Highly recommended and reasonably priced.", "Thankfully, no one in our family has gotten badly sunburned this summer, so I can't completely comment on how SunBurnt works for truly reddened skin. However, I can say that it offers a cooling effect on sunscreen-protected skin that has baked in the sun for hours on end at the pool, as my wife and stepson can attest to. My gut feeling is that SunBurnt could potentially do a pretty good job of giving your sunburn some relief, though of course it won't fully heal it. It claims to cool, soothe and reduce peeling skin, and because SunBurnt contains aloe it probably does do these things fairly well. One thing I can say without hesitation is that SunBurnt feels good on your skin when it's initially applied. That sensation, however, doesn't last too long.It's been my personal experience that products like these can sometimes irritate sunburned skin and make you severely itchy after application, so use this product sparingly at first. SunBurnt might work differently on varied types of skin, so use caution.", "I try to be careful with my fair & freckled skin, but sometimes I slip up.  I unintentionally burned my shoulders and lower back.  Sunburnt rescued me from serious pain!  As soon as I realized my skin was badly burned, I applied Sunburt and intantly felt cooled.  The gel texture was refreshing and soothed the pain.  It soaked in quickly and did not get sticky, like so many other products. My shoulders get a good bit of sun, but my rarely exposed lower back made me worry-- but Sunburnt really helped.  I did not even peel - and I ALWAYS peel.  Great product to keep in your first aid kit.  While I don't have he tube in hand, it seemed like the ingredients were natural and not chemical.", "I do not typically burn. However I installed a pool last year and spend alot of time in it . I did not notice as I was floating around on my chair reading that I was burning. I was skeptical  of this product thinking it was like all the rest .  I found it to be soothing, reduce the hot feeling ,kept my skin hydrated and helped with the pain making it much easier and more comfortable to deal  with the sunburn.", "I swim about 45 minutes almost every day.  I ride a scooter 20 minutes each way to the pool.  We live in the high desert.  It's HOT!  I am a very light skinned person and prone to burning.  Before I received this product I used Calendula cream or lotion because it is recommended for sunburns, which I see is listed as the first ingredient in this product.  That was good to see because I believe the Calendula really helped.  I was surprised when I first put this on because I expected it to come out as a white cream, but it is a clear gel.  After applying it the first time and waiting a minute or so my skin actually felt COOL; aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh.  :-)  I have not burned since using it.I see it's on Subscribe and Save and the price is good.
