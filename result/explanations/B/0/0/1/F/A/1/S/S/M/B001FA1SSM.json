"], "reviews": ["\"I like a pretty wide variety of cereals, and I'm a proud member of the \"\"cereal is good for any meal or snack at any time of day\"\" club.  Having tried this new product, I'll be adding it to my (admittedly lengthy) cereal shopping list.The taste is fairly sweet, but not overly so.  When looking at the amount of sugar in a serving, bear in mind that the natural sugar here is not the same crap as the processed white sugar and corn syrup found in less healthy foods.  The flakes and dried fruit are distinct, and don't mix together in a single sugary flavor like sweetened kids' cereals often do.  However, at least in the box I got, the fruit was a little sparse.  If I were designing the ideal mix, I'd probably increase the ratio of fruit pieces to flakes.The glazed flakes are very thick and very crunchy.  In fact, I get to the bottom of the bowl before they start to get soggy at all.  This distinguishes this cereal from other, similar products with thinner flakes.  Those who have trouble chewing and prefer a soft cereal probably won't like it.  The slightly powdery dried fruit is closer to what you find in other cereals of this nature.The rather substantial flakes make this cereal pretty filling, more so than you might think from looking at it (it lies somewhere between other flake & fruit types and granola), but the box is still pretty small.  Those who, like me, generally eat a large bowlful will go through a box in about three servings tops.  At the time I'm writing this, the product is \"\"currently unavailable,\"\" so I don't know what the price will be when it returns to Amazon.  So bear in mind that this 6-box pack will probably give you about 18 bowls of cereal when considering the cost.\"", "The box says 100% natural with no artificial preservatives,flavors,or colors.  And its true.  Here is the ingredients list:---Multigrain flakes, brown sugar, barley flakes, honey, dried strawberries/raspberries/blackberries, and vanilla extract.In 'One Cup' (without milk) you will get:210 calories, 4% sodium, 5% potassium, 20% fiber!, 17 g of sugar and 5g of protein.The cereal box is so simple that it's cool.  Just brown cardboard, no fancy design, no pretentiousness, just a box of healthy cereal.", "When I first tried this, I was all out of milk.  So, I started eating it straight out of the box as a dry snack.  I enjoyed it, for sure.  The flakes are crunchy, and the berries add a nice contrast.  I liked the taste and thought that it had a nice level of sweetness.This morning, I tried it in milk as a regular bowl of cereal.  I didn't enjoy it as much that way.  As some others have said, the flakes are very crunchy...too much so for me in a bowl of milk.  It also didn't taste quite as good to me.So, I won't buy it as a cereal, but I did enjoy it as a snack.  The small (10.5-ounce) boxes make it pretty expensive, though.", "\"Got my box today and decided to have a before-bed snack.  The cereal is good, if not a bit sweet for my tastes.  I like a little sweetness, but this is too much. I'm still buzzing from the sugar, so please forgive my review if it's a bit sappy.  I think they've done this sweet-coating thing to the flakes to keep them from getting soggy too fast, but it also has made them extremely hard and crunchy.I mean, these flakes are HARD.If you have any loose teeth or wear dentures (neither of which is my case) you might want to soak these flakes in milk for a bit before eating them.  A friend stopped by and ate a handful earlier and it sounded like a horse was here eating a handful of nuts and bolts. My ears are still ringing from my bowlful. You get the picture.The berries are the typical freeze-dried kind, they get soggy and somewhat berry-like in milk and for what they are, not bad.  We've all seen these before, they are almost styrofoam-like consistancy when dry but mush when wet. There's no in-between. But they do add a nice flavor to the mix and the variety is nice (although the blueberries still have yet to make much of an appearance in my box).I like the fact that this is organic and all natural with no preservatives or dyes or other nasties, so I'll put up with the sugar-buzz and eat the rest of this box.  And speaking of the box, very cute idea to have a little window in there, but I don't see why the additional layer of plastic is necessary.  After all, the cereal comes in a plastic bag inside the box... wouldn't it be a little more earth-friendly to leave that off?  I'm just sayin'...Good cereal, kids will like it for the sugar (hey, I ate Sugar Pops when I was young and thought I'd never come down) and adults will like the \"\"purity\"\" of the zero chemmies.  And, if any of the kiddies teeth break off, no worries, they get another set.Adults?  Let those flakes soak!\"", "Not only tasty, but surprisingly hearty for a flake-type cereal.  It's nicely crunchy and the crunch holds up well in milk.  The fruit flavor, a blend of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and grape juice, comes through strongly.  I downgraded this one star only because it is sweetened so heavily -- almost all of the ingredients besides the flakes and fruit (and there is more sweetener than fruit) are sweeteners of one kind or another (malted barley syrup, cane juice, molasses, grape juice, brown sugar, honey).  It also comes in a box that is significantly smaller than the average cereal box, containing only 10.5 ounces or 5 servings, which makes it an expensive proposition.  Each 1-cup serving has 5 grams of fiber (20% of the daily recommendation) and a meager 5 calories of fat.  All in all, a good cereal and one I would buy again if the price was right.", "This cereal was like trying to eat tree bark. Flakes are way to thick and didn't even soften up in milk. You better have strong teeth if you try to eat this stuff.", "\"The BACK TO NATURE SUMMER BERRY BLEND CEREAL tastes pretty good. It's not too sweet and you don't have to add any sugar, which is what I like about it.It contains a dried mix of raspberries, strawberries and blackberries that provide a tart taste to the semi-sweet whole grain brown flakes (which contains honey, brown sugar and molasses).When I first added milk to the cereal the scent reminded me of dry dog food, LOL, but I guess that must be from the honey and molasses. Luckily it didn't taste like kibble!Anyway, the SUMMER BERRY BLEND CEREAL is SUPER crunchy, even in milk, so if you have bad teeth or dentures you might have to soak the cereal for a while. Eating the cereal dry actually tastes really good, even better, but it's like eating super hard corn chips.The box says that it's 100% natural and also \"\"whole grain\"\" but it doesn't say \"\"100% Whole Grain\"\" which is what the nutritionist recommend. It provides 5g of fiber and has no saturated fat or cholesterol, and only has 0.5 grams of fat.\"", "\"I'm a total cereal-aholic, and I really enjoyed the Back to Nature cereal. First, it has a TON of berries! One of my pet peeves is \"\"berry\"\" cereals where you get maybe half a dozen berries per bowlful. Second, it's super crunchy and stays that way. I might even say it's a bit TOO crunchy, as if you don't give it a minute to soften up in the milk, it almost hurts your teeth!However, the box is quite small (just five servings, and that's if you don't like massive bowls of cereal, like me!), and that makes it a rather pricey buy. So while I really enjoyed sampling it, I don't know that I'll buy it in the future unless I see it on sale.\"", "I love the fact that that the cereal flakes remain crunchy long after the milk has been poured. They did not get soggy. I also enjoyed the variety of berries. So far I've not gotten a black berry, but the strawberry and raspberry combination is delicious.When I tasted a flake without the milk it had a chocolate-like flavor. After pouring the milk, the vanilla flavor became dominant. I actually wouldn't mind if they took the vanilla down a notch. But that is just my personal preference, because vanilla is no longer my favorite flavoring.If you like soggy cereal, you might not enjoy this as much as I did. My son liked the flavors, but did not like the fact that it did not get soggy.Above all, I appreciate the fact that this is a healthy cereal without any form of corn syrup. I am not a big fan of corn syrup.Ingredients: whole grain wheat, whole grain wheat flour, barley flour, malted barley syrup, evaporated cane juice, molasses, grape juice concentrate, sea salt, vitamin E, brown sugar, barely flakes, honey, dried strawberries, dried raspberries, dried blackberries, vanilla extract. Manufactured on equipment that processes soy and milk.", "Back to Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal is an interesting product in the health cereal category. Featuring super-hearty flakes of whole grain, your morning breakfast will be an orgy of chomping and texture bursts with loud crunching sounds vibrating throughout your head. There are also super-sized chunks of blackberries, rasberries and strawberries which are appetizingly dehydrated but retaining all their natural color and fragrance. In fact, when you open the box and pour over milk, you will be enveloped with a cloud of lucsious berry fragrance which is surprising at first. This cereal is obviously very fresh and potent right out of the box, due to its all-natural ingredients and proprietary manufacturing process. As other reviewers have noted, the only downside is this cereal's high sweetener content, albeit they're all-natural sweeteners. As a health food buyer myself, I would have preferred if there were no sweeteners, and I don't particularly need any sweetness for taste in a cereal, although I don't think this cereal tastes too sweet. But it's certainly not for anyone with sugar sensitivities. I give it four stars only because it has sugar, and a health food cereal shouldn't have sugar. Otherwise it would merit five. But for people without medical sugar conditions, this cereal is fine to have occassionally, and it tastes delicious, is all-natural (but not organic--maybe due to economics?), so enjoy the great taste.", "Okay, this box of cereal literally disappeared in a flash around my house. It stays crunchy in milk and the strawberries in it look very nice. It is plenty sweet for our palates and every child and adult enjoyed eating it. Unlike some cereals that strive for more pure ingredients, this does not taste like cardboard.The only thing I might say is that if you are looking for a low sugar or low carb cereal, this is probably not it. Not a lot of chemicals, sweetened naturally, but not lo-cal or low-sugar. Still, we'll probably buy it again because of the natural ingredients and great taste. But it may have to be an occasional treat, due to the fact that my teenage boys can eat a whole box of it by themselves and it is not cheap.", "Loved the texture of the crunchy, hi-fiber flakes. They're thicker and less prone to turn mushy with milk. Great tasting and not too sweet. I often ate it out of the bag as a snack. This would have been 5 stars if not for the freeze-dried fruit bits as those tend to turn to powder in the bag or disintegrate into mush in milk.", "\"While this promotes more \"\"natural\"\" approach to food, that term is used very liberally. This doesn't contain those artificial ingredients like hydrogenated oil and high fructose corn syrup, but it sure has 5 (maybe 6) sweeteners: 1) malted barley syrup; 2) evaporated cane juice; 3) molasses; 4) brown sugar; 5) honey; and possible 6) grape juice concentrate. Also, I expected the cereal to be organic - it's not.However, the sodium is very respectable at 100mg, though who needs salt when the cereal is this sweet? Dietary fiber is also good at 5g. Because this product is \"\"natural,\"\" there are no vitamin/mineral fortification - this could be good or bad, depending on the person. I also like the company for honestly stating the nutritional stats based on a full 1-cup serving, rather than the 3/4-cup.I'm pretty sure I lost a taste for sugary cereal, so this is too sweet. The flakes also need some milk-bath time, but the good thing is that they stay crunchy for a while. Very crunchy.\"", "Very hearty, tasty cereal.  I was amazed at how long it stayed crunchy, particularly the flakes!  Seriously, who wants soggy cereal?!  There were lots of pieces of dehydrated fruit, giving a nice overall berry flavor to it and adding a touch of sweetness without a bunch of sugar or artificial sweeteners.  I have really enjoyed all Back to Nature products and this one definitely met my expectations as far as flavor goes.", "\"I'm a big fan of the Back to Nature brand and this \"\"Summer Berry\"\" cereal continues in their marketing of fresh-tasting and delicious cereals.Highly recommended for any looking to kick back to those summer days with some tasty fruity cereal.Final Verdict: 8/10-AP3-\"", "Truly stays crunchy in milk. Very tasty with just enough brown sugar without becoming too sweet.  It has strawberries, raspberries and blackberries but the blackberries are hard to find in the box..  The dried fruit is tangy and tasty, especially without milk.  Nice product but a bit pricey.", "I'm not generally a cold cereal guy, but Back to Nature, Summer Berry Blend Whole Grain Cereal easily won me over.  The multigrain flakes are sweetened with just the right amount of brown sugar and evaporated cane juice that nicely complements the tartness of the chunks of dried strawberries, raspberries and blackberries that actually taste like they're supposed to, naturally.Best of all, these aren't your wimpy flakes that quickly go all soggy the minute they hit a bowl of milk.  They pack a real satisfying crunch without the need for any added preservatives, artificial flavors or colors.", "Summer Berry Blend is a whole grain cereal that is 100% natural, and the box itself looks pretty natural even. Not to scare you off, but the natural taste of the cereal may come off as resembling something similar to cardboard, but it may not be that bad depending on your taste. There also aren't any artificial preservatives or flavors. There is an assortment of dried fruit to complement the multigrain flakes - strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries.Fresh fruit would serve as a much better accompaniment to the dryness and crunchiness of the flakes (which last in milk long enough for you to read the paper, watch television, and still enjoy the crunchiness), as the dried fruit is rather tart, although still sweet. Summer Berry Blend is better than most run-of-the-mill healthy cereals, but not everyone enjoys the same things in a given cereal. But with five grams each of protein and fiber, as well as some fruitiness, this is worthy of a spoonful of your time.And if this truly floats your boat, there is another natural cereal available by Back To Nature -Cinnamon Crunch.", "\"I always on the look out for a cereal that is healthy enough for my son (i.e. low sugar, high nutrients) and a good nutritional option for me (reasonable calories per serving, low sodium, high nutrients).  Needless to say finding a tasty option that meets both of our needs so that I can buy one box of cereal rather than two is challenging. Therefore, I was extremely excited about the \"\"Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal\"\".The cereal is certainly tasty and in terms of nutrients its not bad. There are lots of dried fruit pieces and substantial crunchy flakes.  The bad note, however, is that the cereal is less than I hoped in terms of some factors:Good:  fruit pieces, high fiber, low sodium, NO saturated fats, reasonable proteinBad: calories are relatively high/serving, vitamins less than I thought for the berries included, sugars/carbs are pretty high.So it's not the best and not the worse - a tasty, relatively nutritious option that pleased both young and \"\"not so old\"\".\"", "\"We all liked the taste of this cereal.  Not only does it contain dry berries (easy to chew, freeze-dried?), but the flakes themselves have a nice berry taste on top of the wheat-flake taste (which reminded me of sweetened Total cereal).However, the flakes are very substantial - they need strong chewing and might not be good to feed to small children for that reason.  Also they stay crunchy for a long time with milk.They are trying to market this is a \"\"natural\"\" healthy product, however putting it into a non-glossy brown box doesn't automatically make it healthy.  Comparing with our box of Frosted Flakes (USA version), the sugar content is about the same per volume.  This cereal has 17 grams of sugar per cup, and Frosted Flakes has 16 grams per cup !!!  Because of the whole wheat and dried fruit, it is probably a better choice than Frosted Flakes, but don't kid yourself that it is any healthier from a macro-nutrient point of view.\"", "First up, flavor wise, this stuff was good. Nice flavor. The berries tasted very sweet and tart - perfect.  The crunch was good. All and all a very nice way to start the day. Here's my only gripe - the box is way too small. I know this is true with all things that are good, but seriously, the box states that it has only 5 servings in it. Thats a lot packaging for 5 servings.", "I'll admit this delicious, crunchy, sweet, fiber-rich cereal isn't for everyone.  Not everyone has the teeth for it.  But wow, if you like your cereal crunchy and with tons of berries, this is for you.  The summery berry blend consists of raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries.  Yes, it's sugary, but with all that fruit you can expect it; there is no processed white sugar, and little or no preservatives.  If it sounds intriguing to you, give it a shot!  I'll buy a box again sometime.", "I had doubts that I would like this cereal but surprise surprise it actually tasted good!It is quite crunchy too, I had to let the milk soak in for at least 5 minutes to give my 50 year old teeth a break. That 5 minutes is worth the wait because this  cereal has plenty of taste, the berries have all their taste, it just sweet eough and is quite filling.The box has an interesting design and appears to be made with recycling in mind.I enjoyed this cereal so much I had planned to order a 6 box pack but it is out of stock, too bad really.The only suggestion I have for Back-To-Nature is to offer a variety pack because several of the flavors look pretty tasty but I don't want to buy that many packs of cereal!I recommend this to everyone that loves good tasting all natural food!", "This cereal was tasty, but a little too sweet for my liking. I like the low fat (0.5 grams) and high fiber (5 grams) part. It's also extremely crunchy- kind of like that commercial where the guy is eating cereal and can't hear anything anyone is saying to him. If it was any crunchier, I'd worry about losing a filling or cracking a tooth...The dried berries added lots of flavor, and, in my opinion, reduced the need to sweeten the flakes with so much sugar.By my calculations, a serving of this cereal is worth 3 points (Weight Watchers) not including milk; if they could remove about 50 calories, (out of 210)by bringing down the sugar content, that would bring the points value down to 2 points.We'll probably finish the box, but I think I'll stick with my preferred low fat, very high (9+ grams) fiber cereals from Trader Joe's.", "I liked the crunchiness of Back to Nature even after it sat in skim milk for a short period of time.I was surprised to see so many pieces of fruit, especially strawberries, which plumped up very well in the milk.  The cereal has a subtle berry flavor.I have compared this cereal with my usual cereal - Fiber One Raisin Bran Clusters and did notice the following for 1 cup:Sugar---17g Back to Nature13g Fiber OneFiber--5g  Back to Nature11g Fiber OneTotal Fat - Both in both ranged from 0.5g to 1g - Back to Nature vs. Fiber OneCalories--250 calories with 1/2 cup of fat free milk - Back to Nature220 calories with 1/2 cup of fat free milk - Fiber OneI shopped my local grocery store and noticed that Back to Nature priced at over $4.25 for a 10.5 ounce box.  I see on Amazon that a six pack works out to around $3+ per box--not a bad price, especially with free shipping.I liked the taste of Back to Nature, but for the difference in price, and the fact that Fiber One has more fiber impact, I will probably stay with Fiber One.", "This cereal exactly suits my particular tastes:I like berries rather than raisins in my cereal, and this has LOTS of berries versus other cereals that I've tried which have only a few.I prefer less sweet cereal, and the sweet level in this is perfect for me--it will probably be less sweet for people with sweeter tastes and too sweet for people with less sweet tastes, but for me, this is great. The sweetness of the cereal seems to come mostly from the berries rather than a lot of added sweetening.I love hearty textures (for example, I enjoy Grape-Nuts) and these flakes are very crunchy, even after sitting in milk.It's an added bonus that there are not artificial preservatives, flavors or colors in this cereal. There's also 5 g of fiber per serving--very nice--and zero fat.One thing I don't care for with this cereal is that the package is a bit small. The recommended serving size is 1 cup, and there are only 5 servings in the box. One cup is actually a bit too much for me--I eat only about 1/2 or 2/3 cup of cereal per serving--but even then, the package size seems small compared to other cereals. Or maybe I'm just used to the Cheerios mega-sizes.Ingredients: multigrain flakes (whole grain wheat, whole grain wheat flour, barley flour, malted barley syrup, evaporated cane juice, molasses, grape juice concentrate, sea salt, vitamin E), brown sugar, barley flakes, honey, dried strawberries, dried raspberries, dried blackberries, vanilla extract.Serving size: 1 cupServings per container: about 5calories: 210calories from fat: 5Total fat: 0.5 gCholesterol: 0 mgSodium 100mgPotassium 190 mgTotal carbohydrate: 46 gdietary fiber: 5 gsugars: 17gOther carbohydrates: 24 gProtein: 5g", "This is some of the meatiest cereal I've ever eaten.  By meaty I mean thick, super crunchy and really really filling.  I believe this also has more fiber than most of the other cereals I've eaten.  I would say it was tough to get through if it didn't have all the wonderful berries in it.  For the healthy person in you looking for a cereal that will stick with you throughout the day - this would be my first choice!  Now, I'm just waiting for a store near me to carry it.", "My husband loved it, he said the berries were very good and he would buy it in a heart beat - if the price point was good.", "I like sugar as much as the next person.  So why is it that I find this supposedly healthy cereal to be excessively sweet, even when compared to the standard, sugar-laden fare one finds on supermarket shelves?  I suppose that the cereal's makers were attempting to make this cereal more user-friendly, but they went overboard.  All I could taste was sweet.When not recoiling from the cloying taste, I was afraid that my teeth were going to be shattered by the hard-as-nails flakes, which required several minutes of soaking in milk before they became the least bit approachable.  Ye gods!  I just want some breakfast, not an endurance test.  Eating a cereal should not be this rigorous.", "Pretty amazing!I don't even like flake cereals, and had real doubts when this came in with real dried strawberries and other berries.  Came in a brown box too.... Sure, I said to myself.. one of these flako-pretendo greenies whose cereal tastes either too sugary or too wheaty. This one surprised me.The strawberry taste mixed very well into my rice milk, and it's so sweet!!  Too much sugar, I'll bet.  Read the ingredients... a lot of fruit drinks and dried berries.  OK, maybe too unbelievably sweet, but still impressive, and worth a bit of fruit sugars, I guess.Better than any flake cereal I've ever had.", "I don't like sugary cereals in the morning; I prefer a hearty cereal with a hint of sweetness.  This cereal was perfect for that.  The flavor was delicious and it was a filling and all in all pretty healthy.My flakes were tasty and the berries were bursting with flavor.  My issue with the cereal is that the flakes were too crunchy and the berries too mushy.  I don't mind a crunchy flake, but these bordered on being hard.  Even after letting them soak a bit in the milk they were too crunchy for me.  And while the berries retained their flavor in milk, they turned almost immediately to mush.  The contrast of the two was not a good experience in my mouth.The box is really small and the price is a little hefty for the amount of cereal you actually get.  But like I said, the flavor is good.  So if you don't mind a little mush and a lot of crunch, this tasty cereal is for you.Cherise Everhard, January 2009", "I like a lot of crunch, so this cereal was to my liking. I also enjoyed the taste. I was very excited to find a new cereal that I could use as a snack without milk. Until, I saw that it had 46g carb per cup! Wow-that is too much carb, add milk and that is way over the top for one meal. I have tried other similiar type brands of cereal that I did not like the too sweet taste and the carbs were much lower. Not quite sure why this one is so carb high. So, I will not be purchasing in the future.
