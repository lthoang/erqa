It's of the proper shape, weight and well balanced and it should be the better replacement for the lesser microphones you would normally use with games such as Rock Band. Anyone with a gaming console such as PS2, PS3, Xbox or Wii and a 'music' game may find this to be a useful addition to their gaming gear.The good things about this microphone are:+ It's wireless with range of about 30 ft.+ Excellent voice reproduction quality.+ Professional look, weight and balance+ Batteries included+ Goes into sleep mode if not used for about 15 minutes+ Comes with 2 (TWO) wrist straps+ Easy pairs with baseHowever, there's some room for improvement- Limited scope as it's not recognized by the PS3 outside of specific software packages.- As far as the 'singing games' are concerned, it is not clear which games are supported on which platform. There is a statement in small print indicating that SingStar games are not supported but I would be more comfortable if the list of supported games was available so one would know before making the purchase.- The USB wire connects to the base which would make it difficult to have it, let's say on a table. A better solution would have been some 'dongle' plugging into the USB and maybe an independent stand that's just a stand, untethered so that it could be placed anywhere.MY EXPERIENCEI only tested the microphone on a PS3 with Rock Band and it performed well. A wireless microphone does enhance the singing experience. I found the quality of the sound to be excellent. The microphone felt good when held and one feels truly free performing without having to worry about tripping on a wire.EVALUATION AND RATINGWhile this is truly a quality microphone when used with a compatible 'singing game' Most prospective buyers may not feel comfortable not knowing in advance whether it was going to work with a specific game on a specific platform. Another problem is the 'stand' design. Having it tethered to the game console limits its utility as a stand where the microphone can rest.I will round up the 3.5 stars to a 4 because of the fun we had while using it on a game that supported mike and we had not bothered with the badly-designed stand.Note: I only tested this on a PS3 because it was the console on which I had a supported game. I did test on a computer because I couldn't think of any realistic circumstance where I would want to attach this microphone to any of my computers - of which the vast majority (laptops) have microphones and cameras built in already.", "As the owner of Rockband and Guitar Hero for both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 I was truly excited to use this. No more USB wired microphone while playing. The set up was pretty simple and it synced easily with both systems. The microphone works with 2AA batteries which comes included and 2 wriststraps. I didn't get to try out the wireless range but it states that it can go up to 30ft. I have used it constantly now for about 2 weeks and so far I haven't had any problems. It actually makes singing a little bit better. So far it has worked perfectly on both systems. I don't have any singing game to try it on the Wii so I can't say if it works or not, but if you're a Guitar Hero or Rockband fan then this is definitely the mic for you if you're looking for another or even your first one.", "We are a rhythm game home. We play Rock Band, we play Guitar Hero, and in the days of olde, we played Karaoke Revolution. This microphone is a bit on the pricy side, but because it works for so many consoles and so many different games, I think the price is worth it, if you want to go wireless.When we play Rock Band or Guitar Hero, it's usually with a house full of mildly drunk friends, so if there is a sensitivity difference between this microphone and a corded microphone, we couldn't tell the difference. It's nice to have one less cord draped across the living room, but the really great thing about the cordless microphone is I don't have to constantly ask people to not hold the microphone by the cord and swing it around during the lyrically lacking parts of the songs. (Yes, people actually often do this.) Not only was that bad for the microphone, but also bad for my nerves. The lack of an additional cord is especially nice when playing the Beatles Rock Band; it's like a spider web in the house with those three part harmonies. That being said, I don't plan on spending the money for two more of these to become totally lyrically cordless, but the cordless will be the first choice microphone in our house.", "I received this Microphone in the mail and was eager to try it out on my 360 and laptop.  Visually there is nothing special about the microphone; its looks almost identical to the Microphone that was included with Rock Band without the wire of course. However, even though its basic looking it does not look (or feel) cheap.  It appears to be sturdy enough to take the occasional drop without it falling apart.  From past experiences, I have never had any issues with Logitech products and I suspect this one will be no different.  I have tested this with both Rock Band and GH:World tour and no problems with either game.  In addition, I have no issues with the microphone cutting out due to interference or being out of range. Range is excellent and I'm able to go to my son's room and still have the mic function just fine.Other than the steep price, I can't find anything wrong with this microphone.  It works flawlessly with my XBOX games (no games to test it on with my PS3) and on my laptop when I use it with my Rosetta Stone software.  The best thing about this is that it requires no drivers, all you have to do is plug in the USB transponder to your device and turn the Microphone on and your good to go; the batteries are even included!The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the steep price, but if having a wireless mic is THAT important to you, then the price should not be an issue.  In either case you should not be disappointed.", "This is a GREAT addition to my teenager's Rock Band equipment! Extremely realistic feel with amazing voice quality reproduction.  They have used it non stop for the past two weeks and there have been no problems at all.  Comes with batteries and USB adapter / 2.4 GHz wireless technology.  Manufacturer state that there are 20 plus hours of battery life and I do believe this to be true.  The kids use this microphone outside using an Xbox set up to a projector to have a full surround theatre quality look and sound.  This microphone fits right in!  Excellent product!", "I love Rock Band and Guitar Hero but the one thing that really annoyed me was the microphone that came with the first Rock Band. I understand how much came with that first set but the microphone was small and didn't feel anything like a real microphone. I enjoy wireless equipment and I was hoping to find an upgrade for the lousy microphone that was included in the set and Logitech provides an excellent alternative for those who share my disdain for it.The microphone is fairly easy to use and set up. It's very light which is odd since its much bigger than the normal microphone that they give you. It's about the same size as my real microphone but much lighter. The microphone doesn't miss a note and is great for people who love to play and sing at the same time. I have a stand for normal microphones and this one works with that quite well. The receiver it comes with doubles as a stand but it's wobbly and isn't really meant for that (or it is and isn't very good). I don't have a headset for my playstation 3 and was hoping to use this as a communication microphone as well. It can be done but the wobbly receiver stand makes that more annoying and tedious than it should be. Despite that small negative this is still a great purchase.it's a shame the games don't all come with wireless equipment but this is a top of the line microphone for those looking to upgrade their level of game. It's pricey but it's worth it if you're really into Rock Band or Guitar Hero. There isn't a better microphone that emulates the real thing on the market.", "This wireless microphone with USB stand and receiver makes singing in your favorite music game almost 2x the fun.  The included 2AA batteries will run the unit for 20 + hours according to the manual and the 2.4 GHz wireless will read at a range of 30 feet away from the unit.  The hook up is a very simple USB connection and power on mic button that is discreetly flattened to prevent any accidental press. First off I tried this unit with GH World Tour on PS2 worked great 5 stars on 2 songs that I had only 4 starred previously.  Next up the PS3 and a SINGSTAR title NO GO as these games only work with SONYS mics/adapters, this is not a surprise but I thought I would give it a try.  The mic worked great on AC/DC rock band,RB track pack 2 as expected.  Next up the XBOX360 and GH Metallica, 2 songs later and I am scoring better on that game as a vocalist as well.  Very clear reception is offered on this mic and there are no CRACKS or POPS as I sometimes experienced with the old wired LOGITECH mics, also it feels lighter even with batteries but that is probably from the weight drag of the old cord. If you want to sing and play guitar the little mic stand allows for this but you probably are gonna have to sit down and that defeats the wirelss aspect.  The price tag should have included a rechargable battery so 1 star off.  Now the singer can have the same wireless joy as the rest of the band the next time you fire up your favorite USB MIC supported music game.  Recommended heartily.", "I tried this microphone on a Playstation 3 with the Rock Band video game (with this game you can sing while someone else plays the guitar) and on a Playstation 2 with the Karaoke Revolution video game by Konami.  All you do is connect the base station into the PS2 or PS3 via the USB socket and it will automatically detect and configure the microphone.  The wireless range seems to be pretty good as long as you stay in the same room and the overall sound is impressive for a wireless microphone.  The build quality of the microphone is also sturdy so it won't disintegrate into little pieces if you accidentally drop it.As for fun, there isn't a lot that beats singing songs along with a video game!  Both games are very enjoyable but add in the freedom to dance and fool around without a cord slowing you down then it makes it even better!  I even got my 2 year old singing into the microphone so it is child friendly.  Plus points go to this for being a great product which also brings you plenty of fun!", "Logitech has done it again..this time with a wireless Microphone that is intended to be used with game consoles such as the PS2, PS3, Wii, and the XBox 360.  However, it does much more....it works on both PC's and MAC's without any additional software installs.  And now for the review:Box Includes:Logitech Microphone2 AA Batteries (Thank you Logitech)Two nylon hand straps. (use if you need them)A base with a usb cable that attaches to your console/computer (essentialy the receiver and a stand for the mic).Manuals (which I didn't even need to use to get started, but did read to see if I was missing anything.)Xbox360:**Note, couldn't test on a real game on PS3 since we don't have one, but device was recognized and usable.XBOX 360:  We have rock band for the 360 and my son is an addict when it comes to drumming, guitar strumming etc...he has his sister do the singing via a Logitech wired usb MIC made for the 360.  Naturally the wireless model was a welcome change and has a bit more of a professional MIC look and feel.  Off they went, tearing the roof off of our home and in the end it seemed that the performance of the microphone was on par with a wired model.  In other words their scores were the same....the voice recognition worked as it should in Rockband.Unfortunately we do not have any other games that can use a MIC, currently...but RockBand is pretty popular around here.PC/MAC - I am a cross platform user and naturally anything with a USB port has to be tested on my computers...I mean that's what a USB port is for, isn't it?  So first I plugged the MIC in to my Windows 7 x64 machine and the drivers installed on their own.  I went to the audio section and made sure the MIC was listed, which it was...as a Logitech USB Microphone.  I did the usual tests of blowing in the mic, whistling, etc...perfect.  More on the test below.  Once I was satisfied with the PC I plugged the MIC into my Macbook Pro and voila, detected and installed without issue..same series of tests through the system preferences/sound icon.  I am now a happy camper...but I only use a mic on my computers for Skype...so it was time to give it the ultimate test.I made three lengthy phone calls and clearly explained to the other party that I was testing a wireless MIC and that I would be moving away from my computer at regular intervals. (2 of the 3 calls were on a PC and 1 on the MAC).  I basically moved away from the computer at 2ft intervals for a total about 20' and clearly into another room.  The callers actually said the voice quality was perfect, in-fact there was no loss in clarity and or volume at any distance.  I could get very detailed here...but the summary is that it does work and it works flawlessly.  Naturally walking 20ft away from a computer for a phone call is strange since you have to turn the speakers up to hear the other party.(**The MIC does have a push button on it that acts to power on the device and power it off.  It can also be used to pair the mic to the base station should they ever lose connectivity)Logitech has another stellar product on their hands, and I would not expect it to be any other way.  I will be updating the review to inform you of real world battery life.  But for the time being this MIC gets a 5/5 in my book for the look, the feel, and the over all quality and compatibility that it offers.", "One thing that happens constantly at my place is Rock Band parties.  One thing that hampers these fun parties are cords.  I can't stand them and what inadvertently happens is a web or cords that (sometimes drunk) people have to manuever around.  It's not exactly the best experience at times.  When I heard that Logitech was bringing a cordless mic to the party, I got excited for a couple reasons.  Of course there's the aforementioned cord issue but also that Logitech makes some great (albeit usually expensive) products.  The Wireless Microphone fits right in that same area.Setup is a breeze.  The package comes with two main pieces, the microphone and the holder/USB receiver.  Plugging the USB receiver into the Xbox 360 provides you with the wireless capabilities but also doubles as a place to hold your microphone when not being used.  It takes AA batteries which is good and bad.  I really enjoy products that have a built in rechargable battery, but this also allows quick and easy replacement if you're in the middle of a party and don't have time to recharge.The microphone works very well.  It's more like a full-sized microphone that I'm used to at Karaoke bars and has a nice, heavy heft to it.  It picks up your voice a lot better than the mics that come with either Rock Band or Guitar Hero and the sound quality it picks up is also much clearer.  I even used it on my PC and recorded some voice tracks to test the quality and it works wonderfully.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for and the Logitech microphone excels at both a more maneuverable option and as a great quality microphone.  Very much recommended.", "\"Pros:+ Works on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Wii games I tried.+ Also works as a wireless PC microphone.+ Comes with 2 hand straps.+ Simple setup.+ Hollow base allows for cord storage.Cons:- Not rechargeable, runs off two AA batteries.- Sensitive on \"\"Star Power\"\" during Guitar Hero games.- Wrist strap is not adjustable.- No support for Singstar games- The box doesn't mention it supports Wii games?Well, it's rare these days to find a peripheral that works on multiple game systems, and I'm glad that Logitech has strived to please gamers for the Xbox, Wii, and PlayStation.To start with, this is a very simple microphone to set up. I uploaded the 4-part instruction booklet that came with the microphone (you can see them under \"\"customer images\"\") and within no time at all I had the batteries in, the wrist strap attached, and was playing several different games on multiple systems.First, I tried outKaraoke Revolutionon my PlayStation 2 slim. It looks like I still have the stuff, since I scored Platinum on my first 2 songs.The next game I tried was an older game calledLife Line, a voice-command game. I thought this game only worked with a USB headset, but I was very pleased to find it worked with this microphone on both my PlayStation 2 slim and my PlayStation 3 systems. My voice commands came through loud and clear.The last two games I played wereGuitar Hero World Tourfor the PlayStation 3 and theWii, and Logitech's microphone worked for both games on both systems. I only played on the medium and hard difficulties, but that was enough for me to see it worked great. I even walked through another room while singing - you know you're using a powerful peripheral when it registers a voice through 6 feet of drywall, wiring and utility pipes.I personally didn't get to try this microphone on an Xbox, but from other reviewers it seems to work well - so that's 4 separate video game systems this microphone works on, as well as my PC. Not too shabby!The only cons I found were these:In the Guitar Hero World Tour games, Star Power for the microphone is activated by either clapping one's hand against the microphone or pressing a controller button. Sometimes my voice would activate Star Power prematurely, and other times when I clapped my hand on the microphone it wouldn't register my singing for a few seconds.The hand strap couldn't be adjusted - this isn't a huge issue unless you're planning to do stage dives or other acrobatics.I was baffled by the lack of support on SingStar games - there are more than 30 titles between the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox and the Wii, and it's surprising that such a versatile microphone won't play any of them. To their credit, Logitech did mention that these games are not supported on the back of the box. Hopefully the next Logitech microphone will support these games.Also, why would Logitech not mention that this microphone also works on the Wii? The box says \"\" For PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 \"\" - that's a very LARGE customer base to ignore.If you're looking for a microphone that can be used across multiple systems, this is the one to choose.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.21125563979148865, 0.03751472756266594, 0.13642746210098267, 0.002852323465049267, 0.1566922515630722, 0.015974756330251694, 0.04407399892807007, 0.12032084167003632, 0.056177329272031784, 0.14742834866046906, 0.07128231227397919]]}
