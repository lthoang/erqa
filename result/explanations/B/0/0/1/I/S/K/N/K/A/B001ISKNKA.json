It doesn't get any better than this - a stabilized, high quality 45-200mm zoom for less than 300 dollars?  You bet!  Sure the aperture is f/4.0-5.6, but that's pretty typical for a low cost zoom.  What's not so typical is the superb image quality, great stabilization, and quality build.It gives you good coverage at the long end up to a nice 400mm equivalent, perfect for wildlife and nature photography.  The short end is a nice portrait length and you can easily go tight when you need to.  It's easy to handle and fairly smooth in operation.  It's mostly all been covered in the other reviews here, so I won't repeat all that, but this is a superb value and a great lens.I matched this up with the great Panasonic 14-45mm zoom to cover the short end and the highly regarded panny 20mm f/1.7 pancake prime (for best available light close-in shooting) together with my G1 and really feel like I have it covered.  Possibly the nicest, lightest, most compact kit I've ever assembled (not to mention low cost as well).I am able to get some great hand-held shots and overall sharpness is very good.  The OIS stabilization seems to work very well and this is definitely the easiest lens I have ever used hand-held at the full 200mm (400mm).2012-02-19 Update: See the comments for some good info (thanks, Les!) on the \"\"extended zoom\"\" features -- hand-held shots at 800mm - wow!  ;)2012-04-29 Update: Still loving this lens.  Wonderfully useful range, if I only take one lens, this is often my choice, though the 14-45mm is pretty handy as well.  The 20mm is also very nice, but, obviously, for more specific uses. (If you're in situations where you can \"\"zoom with your feet\"\" it's great.  Also wonderful in low light.)2012-07-07 Update: I love this lens!  I get an impressively high percentage of good shots with this lens.  The quality is superb and it is a joy to shoot with.  When you shoot with a fine lens, it really does make a difference.  For the price asked, this one is hard to beat.\"", "When I bought my GX1, the included kit lens was thePanasonic 14-42mm. For as excited as I was about getting the GX1 (after lusting after the GF1 and GF2 for quite some time), I was pretty disappointed with the extremely light weight, plastic feel of the 14-42mm with its stiff zoom.I knew I wanted to get another lens for the camera, but I had to make a choice due to limited funds: ditch the 14-42mm and opt for the older but more robustPanasonic 14-45mmlens that used to be included with Panasonic's m4/3 kits, go all out for quality and low-light performance with thePanasonic 20mm f/1.7lens, or go for versatility with this 45-200mm lens.I'm glad I went with the choice I made by picking up this lens. Replacing my kit lens with the 14-45mm probably would have been the cheapest option once I sold off my 14-42mm kit lens, but I would have been left with pretty much the same available focal length and composition options. The 20mm would excel in low light, but it costs what this lens and the 14-42mm kit lens cost together, and I knew it wouldn't provide me the flexibility I'd want when shooting pictures of the kids out playing or at the zoo. Going with this 45-200mm, I cover an extremely wide range between two lenses for a very affordable price. While the 14-42mm isn't very quality feeling, having it is still better than having no wider angle lens option at all, and it still takes good pictures. The 45-200mm feels very high quality in comparison. A nice smooth zoom, a rubber zoom ring, and an optical image stabilization that works great.If you haven't used a telephoto lens before, you may be surprised by how heavy this little lens can start feeling once you've been holding it up in front of your face for a couple of minutes. It's not ungainly, but it's good to rest your arms often if you're shooting handheld to help keep camera shake to a minimum. This lens makes me want to pick up thePanasonic DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finderfor both easier composition when trying to snap pictures of a moving target at the longer focal lengths, and for extra stabilization during shooting thanks to being able to brace the camera against your face instead of having to hold it far enough away to frame the picture via the rear LCD screen.If you have any of the micro four-thirds cameras from Panasonic or Olympus and have been shooting with just your kit lens up until this point, I would highly recommend you pick this up as your first add-on lens purchase. You'll be impressed with the clarity, color reproduction, and sharpness of this lens, and the versatility in composition this lens will bring to your kit is the best available zoom-range-to-dollar option I've seen in the Panasonic and Olympus m4/3 lens offerings.", "Given the price and reviews, I was not expecting this lens to be as sharp as the sample I tried was. However, the CA problems were rather extreme, unexpected given full-resolution sample images taken with it that I had seen. DARN! It is light and reasonably compact (given its range), has a good stabilizer, and is very pleasant to use - but in high-contrast lighting situations, CA problems were VERY obvious, even on CA-correcting Panasonic bodies with shooting JPGs. In normal-contrast lighting situations, this would likely be less of a problem, but it was one for me.", "\"I just got this lens a few days ago and I am sold!  I bought the Olympus Pen E-PL1 kit from Amazon Warehouse deals and saved enough to also get this lens at the same time.I currently have a Canon Rebel T3i, with some \"\"L\"\" lenses, and I knew I was stepping down, but had read about the 4/3 systems and was interested in a smaller camera for those times when the Canon was just plain too big and too heavy.  Frankly, so far I don't miss all those extra pixels!I mainly take photos of nature and my dogs and consider myself pretty much an amateur hobbist when it comes to photography.This lens appears to be well made, it feels good in my hands, and everything works smoothly and quietly.  I do miss the light gathering capacity of the Canon, but I knew this wouldn't do the same when I bought it so I wasn't disappointed.So far, photos are crisp and tack sharp at ALL lengths, I see no drop off with the longer lengths and the colors are GREAT!If you are stepping up from a point and shoot, or, like me, looking for something easier to lug around this lens IS a keeper!\"", "This lens exceeds the quality and value of the outstanding Zuiko Digital 4/3 45-150mm kit lens found on Olympus E-xx series kits from about 2-3 years ago.  I shot with a set of those highly-regarded kit lenses and they rocked for the price (despite cheap Chinese BQ and plastic mounts and not as much reach at the high end).The 45-200 G Vario and it's stablemate the 14-45 G Vario are the best m4/3 zooms for their price, bar-none. Superb sharpness and portability, good Japanese BQ (metal mounts) and fast focusers--that they can be had for under $300 each to cover you from 28-400mm 35mm equivalent sweetens the deal.  >thumbs up&lt;(PS while the zooms can be tight when you first get them: they should loosen up nicely.)", "This lens was a perfect addition to the kit lens for my Panasonic GF5.  WIth the neck strap, I have been able to get steady handheld shots even when zoomed all the way to 200mm.  I've used it a bit for video too, the OIS helps but a tripod or monopod is necessary when zoomed it.  Great results, however!This lens even seems to be a slightly better build quality than the kit lens, as well - it zooms a little smoother with less scratchy plastic noise that the kit lens has a little bit of.", "\"How you view this lens will largely depend on your expectations. This is not a top notch lens, like theOlympus Zuiko 50-200mm f/2.8-3.5, and you can't really expect that sort of performance from it. This is, rather, a \"\"budget telephoto\"\": a bit slow, a bit cheaply constructed, possessing some minor optical defects.The aperture range of 4-5.6 is exactly the norm for this class of lens, and it's a major weakness. This thing needs light, and lots of it; you might as well forget shooting moving subjects unless it's a sunny day or you're using a flash.This is my only OIS lens for M4/3, and thus far I'm rather unimpressed with this stabilization technique for stills. My E-P2's in-body stabilization seems to be more effective, so I use that instead (note to PEN shooters: you can't combine OIS with in-body IS, you must choose one or the other). If you're shooting Panasonic, OIS is your only option, and it's better than nothing.When it comes to video, though, OIS is a godsend. The E-P2's IBIS doesn't work in video mode, with the body instead employing software compensation, so OIS is a real win here. This makes the 45-200mm (or another Panasonic OIS lens) a better choice than the Olympus equivalents for video work on Olympus bodies.Build quality is somewhat marginal, but probably above average for this class. It does have a metal mount and it doesn't wobble or stutter during zoom. The zoom ring is fairly smooth and the focus ring is, as with other M4/3 lenses, really an electronic control for the AF micromotor. Love it or hate it, it is what it is; I've gotten used to it and find it to be quite effective, but I still can't quite get the hang of not having any physical stops at the ends of the range. I really wish there was some kind of visual cue as to your focusing distance displayed in the EVF; surely the body does have this data, I just don't think it can be displayed.Lens size is a bit on the beefy side of things, looking slightly imbalanced on my E-P2 (especially with the hood mounted). Of course, this *is* a telephoto, and you have to accept that it will have some extra bulk. It's still a good bit smaller than comparable lenses for DSLRs, but don't expect that this thing will be slipped into your pocket like the diminutivePanasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens.Sharpness is pretty darn good across the frame even wide open. Keep in mind that 400mm equivalent f/5.6 can be very difficult to handhold, even with OIS, and at that focal length atmospheric haze can reduce contrast (I have to wonder whether these factors contribute to some peoples' perceptions of softness). It may not be \"\"tack sharp\"\" wide open, and the pixel peepers will surely lament this fact, but in most cases it's perfectly usable even for moderate crops.Chromatic aberration, on the other hand, is no joke. Point this thing at a tree backed by a light sky and you'll see huge purple fringing towards the corners. Stopping down helps but doesn't get rid of it. I understand that Panasonic bodies automatically compensate for this, but my Olympus surely isn't doing so.There's also some fairly substantial vignetting wide open, which won't be a problem in most real world scenarios, but is something to be aware of.Autofocus on this lens is very snappy and nearly silent on my E-P2 with the latest firmware. It's much better than the kit lens in both respects, easily a match for my DSLR with a comparable lens. Again, this makes it a good choice for video.At the end of the day, this lens meets my expectations: it's a competent performer that has weaknesses which are typical of its class. As of the time of writing, this is also the *only* lens longer than 150mm with a native M4/3 mount, so if you want the range you have little choice (outside of purchasing an expensive and massive 4/3 telephoto like the Zuiko 50-200mm f/2.8-3.5 and combining it with aPanasonic Mount Adapter).If I have one complaint about this lens, it's in the price. I've got a similar lens for my Sony A700 (theSony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6) which costs substantially less, and offer similar performance. We're still paying a premium for M4/3 lenses right now, and this lens serves as a reminder of that fact.\"", "This lens is, arguably, the best deal going in M4/3 lenses. Is it perfect? Nope. It can be a bit unwieldy on the smaller Olympus bodies, and I know some people see softness at 200mm. I don't look that closely. All I see is a lens that sells for a good bit less than it probably should for the quality, especially on the used market.", "If you are patient and not buying this lens at full MSRP it is a pretty decent value. Nice zoom range and image quality, though a little soft beyond 150 or 175mm.  Well built, with image stabilization that works pretty well.  No big complaints.  You are getting what you pay for and then some.", "This lens is a great addition to any m4/3 kit.  I've used this lens for everything from shooting birds to shooting concerts and it very infrequently lets me down.My copy of the lens is sharp even at 200mm.  Wide open sharpness and contrast are very similar to an older, non-IS version of the Canon 70-200mm f2.8L lens when shot wide open.  To be fair, the Canon is a much better lens overall.  If the Canon lens is stopped down a little, it has a better image.  But wide open vs wide open, the Panasonic 45-200mm holds its own!I've also compared this lens to the Panasonic 45-150mm.  The 45-150mm may be just a tad sharper, but for all practical purposes they are very similar in image quality.  Personally, I like the extra 50mm of reach that the 45-200 gives you.The lens is a little bit large when compared to other m4/3 lenses, but to me, it has a nice solid feel.I have no regrets about purchasing this lens.  It's very practical, offers great value and great image quality.", "This is a nice lens. Not real compact and kind of heavy. Quite and fast AF. Use on a DMC-G5.", "The price was right when I bought it for $199. I like Panasonic lenses because it always comes with a lens hood. It has built-in OIS on the lens for Panasonic camera which does not have in body IS. For Olympus users, you just turn off the OIS on the lens and use the on camera IS instead. The lens work great outdoors but not good indoors in dimmed light unless a flash is used. Overall, I am happy with this lens not bad for the price.", "I used this 45-200mm lens on a G5 (Micro 4/3, 16mp).Images with this lens are pretty bad.  Not only soft, but edges in areas of fine detail and high contrast are choppy both in JPEG and RAW.  Foliage tends to have a paintbrush effect.  My FZ150 does better in comparable situations, to say nothing of the 55-300mm kit lens on my K-r, an APS-C 12mp camera.Maybe I got a bad copy (this happened with the first copy of the 55-300mm lens I got for the K-r, and a replacement copy was excellent) but I can only comment on my experience with the lens I received and used.  BTW it has firmware 1.3.I do agree with other reviewers that this lens operates smoothly, is very lightweight, and appears to be solidly constructed.  But the optical quality of the one I got is not acceptable.=====================I ended up with the Panasonic 45-175mm power zoom (for video) and also the Panasonic 100-300mm.  Both have excellent image quality.  DxOMark has rated both of them higher than the 45-200mm (a fact that I did not know when I made the purchases).Maybe I got a bad copy, but as I said I could only review the one I bought.  I'm very happy with the other two.I only wish Pany made something like the 55-300mm or 28-300mm lenses available for many other camera brands' DSLRs.", "\"I just bought this lens for my Olympus E-P3 because at $199 it was ridiculously cheap, and two days later Amazon drops the price another $19! Oh well, at either price, this lens is a SMOKING DEAL!  It is approaching half-price, and for this kind of money, even if you don't use it often, you'll kick yourself if you don't add it to your arsenal at this price.What makes it such a deal is not just the price, but the fact that with the Olympus E-P3, E-PM1, and OMD E-M5, the focus is INSTANTANEOUS.  I don't mean it's fast, I mean it is in focus the instant you depress the shutter or touch a focus point on the touch screen!  If you have touch shutter enabled, you can literally touch the screen and your picture is taken almost before your finger leaves the screen.Although at f4.0-5.6 it's not the brightest, it's reasonable, and a nice Bokeh effect is smooth and reasonably achievable under most circumstances.  I'm not a \"\"pixel-peeper\"\", but to my eye it has good optical performance.  I'm sure if you want all the technical details you can find a good technical review.The only negative is that the zoom was not smooth at first, but it has quickly broken in and become very smooth after only a day of use.In any event, at this price, who could complain if it doesn't perform as well as a lens costing 10 times as much?Obviously, this being a Panasonic lens, it should perform well on any micro four-thirds camera, either Panasonic or Olympus.  But if you have one of the Olympus cameras named above and have noticed that there are very few lenses that these cameras' fast focusing can take advantage of, don't worry, this lens is one that makes the most of Olympus's claimed \"\"world's fastest focus\"\".  And the built-in OIS of this lens gives you the choice using of your camera's in-body image stabilization or the built-in optical stabilization in this lens, as it has an on/off switch for OIS.You've read enough.  If you don't stop right now and order one of these before the price goes up or they run out, you've missed the best deal in the industry.(DISCLAIMER - I don't work for Panasonic or anyone in the industry, I'm not even a serious photographer.  I just love taking photos, especially with stuff that works so well, and especially at a bargain price.)UPDATE - By the way, I have since found out that because this lens has an On/Off switch for its OIS, you can turn the len's OIS on and turn the camera's built-in IS off while taking videos, and completely eliminate the \"\"Jello\"\" or \"\"jelly\"\" effect that the built-in IS of the PM1 or P3 causes in videos.  This is GOOD NEWS for owners of the E-P3 and E-PM1!\"", "The lens is sharp, accurate and captures excellent colors and tones as well as small and light weight...but is soft at full zoom.  Good for the money.  Try buying used at ebay.", "I bought a Panasonic GF-2 and got the extremely popular 20mm lens. Of course, it had no zooming capability. So this is the only zoom lens I own. It was reasonably priced, and zooms quite a great distance. The lens is hard to hold, but that's to be expected with the micro 4/3 system. My only real complaint with it is that the photos it takes are not as crisp and amazing as with the other lenses I have. I don't know if it is because of the MEGA OIS, but sometimes the photos can be a little grainy or low resolution with this lens. If you just need some zooming, this gets the job done. But if I had more money I would have maybe gotten two lenses, one that zooms less than this and one that zooms more.", "Bought this lens for my Panasonic G5 to get more distance than the kit lens allows. The lens operates smoothly, focuses quickly and takes sharp photographs. It's heavier and longer than the smaller kit lens, but I quickly got used to the added weight. The camera and lens combination are still much more compact and lighter than those of full sized SLRs like the Pentax K-r I recently sold.Being greedy, I bought a Panasonic DMW-GTC1 Tele Conversion Lens to add even more distance. I had to but an extra adapter to use the teleconverter and did add some distance at the cost of some picture quality. With the teleconverter attached, the camera must be held perfectly still.Panasonic's 45-200 lens looks and feels good and appears to be made of quality materials.", "I am very impressed by this lens. Its small, lightweight, portable, and extends to 400mm which is amazing for a lens that is so compact. It takes good photos. The only caveat is that there is some chromatic aberration which is not easily eradicated in Photoshop or Lightroom. But the for the size and the quality of the images, its well worth it.", "I bought this lens to go with the Lumix but I found that I liked the fixed focal length lens a lot better.
