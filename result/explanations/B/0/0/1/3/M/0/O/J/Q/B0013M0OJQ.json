"], "reviews": ["\"I received my box of PowerBar Electrolytes on a perfect day and time to test them out, after having packed and loaded an entire art exhibit on a hot day. I felt half dead, put a little packet of this lemony sweet stuff in a bottle of cold water, and voila! I started to resuscitate in a matter of minutes. My thirst was quenched and I definitely felt refreshed and invigorated.On the minus side, it leaves you with that \"\"fake sugar\"\" aftertaste, big time. I would rather have more calories with real sugar than be left with the weird almost metallic flavor of sucralose lingering in my mouth. Another good product ruined by the seemingly ever present sucralose! It is hard to get away from these days, and I wish PowerBar would give us the option of \"\"more calories but the real thing\"\" in their Electrolytes (10 calories per serving as they are now). Were it not for sucralose, I'd give these nifty little packages 5 stars.\"", "If you want your water to taste like the crappiest lemonade on the planet, then use these PowerBar powders.  These are not good.  Yes they have electrolytes, so if you need electrolytes for whatever reason then you might dig these things.  But you are gonna have to deal with the horrid lemony flavor.  Disguisting.", "We tried the lemon flavor and were pleased with the product. It's convenient to carry with you and mixes easily. The lemon taste is not too sweet and not too tart and is very similar to a typical electrolyte drink such as Poweraide or Gatorade. We appreciated the fact that it is not an entirely sugar-based product. We work too hard to burn the calories to take them right back in with fluids.My husband is a professional mascot, so he sweats a lot and looses pounds of fluid at each game. He found this product easier to tolerate than Gatorade and as effective as Poweraide in quenching his thirst and preventing dehydration. We will definitely continue to use this product in the future but would like to see a green, blue, and red version as well. We appreciate the economy size packaging since we really blow through this in a hurry. It's a lot cheaper this way as well.", "I'm pretty active in mountaineering, technical climbing and bicycling, and I always like it when someone comes out with a product that is genuinely refreshing and helps you recover from a workout, but that isn't in a weird-shaped bottle that is difficult to carry around, and isn't chock full of caffeine and sugar for a fake and short-lived boost. This is like Gatorade in a pouch: it's as easy to carry around as a Power Bar (and even looks like one at first glance), and, since you're hopefully carrying water with you anyway, it's easy to mix up a drink just about anywhere. I'll continue to use this product after the samples are used up.", "The flavor here is very bland. If you're expecting some lemonade-type taste you're going to be very disappointed. It even has less flavor than Gatorade, and that's saying something! Still, it's not meant to be a weight-loss drink as much as one for workouts to supply electrolytes, and I suppose it does that. It's also very low calorie (10 calories per serving), but that's about where Crystal Light is in those single packs, so it's not a huge selling point. It does have considerably fewer calories than Gatorade or other energy drinks.", "If you sweat a lot during your workouts or jogging sessions or playing competitive sports, this is a very easy, portable way to have the means to make a quick lemon-flavored sports drink. Basically you just need a glass that can hold at least 16oz of water and a source of cold water and you are all set. I can't recommend it as a substitute for real lemonade as something to drink with a meal, but for replacing sodium, potassium, and 2g of sugar without having to drag along heavy bottles of gatorade or other sports drinks, it's worth getting.", "nothing you would drink for taste. My sports drinks I've had whether Gator Ade, all-sport, etc. have a slight aftertaste. I like the idea of not having to buy any of the above bottled or the hard to find and quite expensive gator Ade mix and feel it does a better of rehydrating and energizing you after a hard workout than fitness water products. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who would mistake it for Crystal Lite or iced tea, because it is a sports drink mix.", "My family found this product great for our hiking trips and easy to carry.  It'll add an extra boost to your water bottle/canteen.  The flavor reminded me of a light lemonade, and made drinking water more enjoyable for me (I'm not a big fan of plain water).  I do urge storing it in an extra container if it's going in a backpack.  Though lightweight and perfect for those long trails on foot or bike, there is the drawback of possibly breaking open a packet.Chrissy K. McVay - Author", "I generally use crystal light and lipton drink packets for amping up my water intake on the weekend so I thought I'd give powerbar a try to see what they bring to the table.  The one difference is that powerbar adds in sodium, which is important in keeping your electrolytes in balance.  If you work out a lot or are out in the heat this would be a good beverage to use and also if you have been sick and are starting back on fluids.Now, for the casual drinker....I would not buy this for the taste, it was lemony, but not in a lemonade kind of way and if you are looking for something sweet this isn't really it.  My husband also took a sip and he basically felt this was a good product and he would buy it.  He liked the fact that the drink was not all that sweet.  I, on the other hand would probably not purchase for myself as I felt it was not sweet enough for me and kind of had a strange taste to me-I can't really pinpoint it, but it tasted kind of like a vitamin.So, to be fair, a three star is our review.  If you are a fan of gatorade this is along the same line and you would probably enjoy this and with the single packets it makes it easy to take along with you.", "The first ingredient of this product is sugar.  That is why I am not giving this more than 3 stars.  I would like this product much more if it had other forms of sweetener.  Besides that, the taste is good. A good lemonade flavor, not too sour.I could see how this handy packet would come in handy for anybody who does hiking, biking, etc. as you just dump the packet into a bottle of water, shake, and drink.  Happy trails!", "Sadly this is my first negative review of any product I've gotten from Amazon. Where to start, it's not as good as Crystal Light, it's not as good as Gatorade or any other electrolyte / sports drink. The lemon tastes very chemical or flat, lemon should be sharp and tart. There's too much of a saltly flavor. It's unfortunate that the packaging is a less environmentally friendly (read multilayer plastic) than Crystal Light (paper).Bad flavor, overpackaged with plastic, a copy of another decent product, and I have to provide my own water. Oh and how fun is it to figure out 16.9 fluid ounces - oh that's 500mL or a half liter or a middle sized water bottle. Directions for mixing were not exactly awesome. I wasn't alone in the house not liking this one, a 12 and 17 year old were not impressed either. Pass on this one.", "This easy to open powdered drink mix-in for 16.9 ounce bottles of water pours easily into the bottle with little or no spillage. Package is easy to open.The flavor is a refreshing lemon that is just right, not too sweet, not too tart, very mild refreshing flavor.  The adults in the family love the flavor, our preteen does not care for the flavor feels it needs to be more bold sweeter flavor.", "\"I like the portability idea very much, that is if there's a \"\"16.9oz\"\" container of water waiting for you at your destination, or if you can measure exactly that amount out and then drink 8 oz of it, refrigerating the remaining 8oz of the serving when you're out exercising.  I'm not sure what you do with the remaining 0.9oz -- you're supposed to mix it up that way, but that small amount doesn't constitute a \"\"serving.\"\"  Are you allowed to drink it anyway?  These silly little serving suggestions are amusing to me.  ;-)The problem with this product for me is what others have mentioned -- the sickly, nasty-sweet sucralose.  It's almost nauseatingly sweet to me, even when I ignore the instructions and mix it in a 24oz cup of water.If they could eliminate the sickly sweetness, I think this drink mix has potential.\"", "\"I think that the idea of having portable packets of powdered power drinks (say that 10 times fast) is a good one. It saves space and you can just throw it in a backpack or suitcase on trips. However, these lemon flavored packets (properly diluted with water) just didn't taste very good to me at all. It was like drinking lemon flavored \"\"Alkeselzer\"\", and resulted in the same bad after-taste. I think the element of taste in a power drink is getting to be more and more important in these times. With that said, if you're looking for 'portable packets of powdered power drinks'... look elsewhere.\"", "I'll give it an extra star because it tastes okay, but these packets aren't really my style.  I'm a PowerBar (and Powerade) fan, but not a fake sugar fan.  And, THAT is what it boils down to.  I just wish they could find a way to make these types of packets without Splenda or aspartame.  These don't do it for me.", "This is supposed to be an electrolyte replacement for post-workout, but the flavor is so snazzy and energizing that I find it gives me an energy before even before my workout starts, minus the excess calories. This is a great alternative to Gatorade and other sports energy drinks. I can't wait until they come out with other flavors.", "This is a great product.It replaces electrolytes and is a better tasting sports drink. Better in the respect that it is stronger in flavor and less bland.The lemon is natural and it tastes natural. Very much like lemonade.In my own personal opinion, it is very sweet, that can be corrected by adding more water.I enjoyed this refreshing drink and also the convenience of the little packets which can easily pour into a water bottle, making it very practical and portable.I recommend this highly.", "I liked the taste of this product, but it has too many carbs for me.", "The small packets of dust are convenient to carry, easy to use, and enhance the flavor of plain old water with a subtle lemon flavor.  Not too sweet, not too tart, just right.  The packets have a notch cut in them so they are very easy to rip open and dump in a .5L (16.9 oz) bottle of water.If you are a believer in drinking electrolytes after a workout, these are great...especially if you are traveling on business or vacationing, because they are easy to pack and carry with you.", "Both my husband and I love this drink - it's flavorful, but not overly sweet, very refreshing.  I prefer to have individual packets to mix with my own water rather than dump a lot of plastic in the landfill.  These are just perfect.", "The PowerBar Electrolytes Lemon flavor powder is a great product.  I have been working out recentally and I drank it after I did my cardio work out. It's worth a few shekels and I will be buying this product in the near future.  Not only is the powder very convienant, but it goes down nicely and tastes pretty good.  All you have to do is mix it with cold water in a plastic 1/2 liter bottle, shake it up and you're good to go.I have tried a lot of other instant powder energy drinks and this one is by far the best tasting and most effective one.  The best thing of all, it doesn't have that nasty tasting aspartame or one of it's products as a sweetener.Highly recommended", "My initial reaction to the taste of this product was, ewwwweearghhh. Feh. I'm sure it has all that you need in electrolytes and nutrients but ouch, the taste!  Very metallic foul taste with a hint of lemony goodness. 20 calories in the bottle and I can't drink this. Maybe others can. Enjoy.", "This is good stuff: you don't have to lug a bottle of sports drink to the gym--just fill your water bottle at the fountain and mix this in. It's not excessively salty or sweet, and tastes a lot better than Gatorade. I also plan to try it for the inevitable summer tummy troubles. It's earth friendly if you use tap/water fountain water, too. No trucks hauling bottles of mostly water around.It's also got fewer calories than sports bars, but it does give you enough energy to keep going, without negating the calories you just burned!", "\"The flavor is strong and if you like lemon as much as I do you will like this product. It is great for travel and one pouch makes 16 oz of water turn into lemonaide with the extra of electolytes to boot, a must for when you are traveling. Since the new rules for air travel do not allow you to carry liquids through security points this product is great as you can carry it through and add it to the bottled water on the other side. Products are expensive in airports and bottled water is cheaper than the \"\"flavored\"\" ones, but you have your pack of Power Bar to compensate! I am sure athletics will enjoy this too as it is light and easily carried anywhere.\"", "\"You don't have to be a triathlete to need a good electrolyte replacement drink, and these are delicious!Sure, they have the pleasant artificial flavor of \"\"Gatorade,\"\" but they lack the cloying sugary sweetness these drinks usually have.  PowerBar Electrolytes are a lighter-tasting version, perfect for the diabetic, weight-watching, or those who just don't like to drink a couple of liters of straight sugar on a hot day.These come in little packets that are perfect to carry with you, or to add to a bottle of water.I'll be making up a Nalgene bottle of filtered water and PowerBar Electrolytes the next time I'm gardening for hours on a hot day.\"", "I like this product, because I'm not buying water. I oppose the comodification of water and transporting it more than necessary is ridiculous. I tried this after a good workout in the garden. I like the taste. I like that it is low in calories, however it has sucralose and I am trying to cut out artificial sweeteners. On the other hand sometimes, I want a sports drink after a workout and I think this is a pretty handy product to have on hand. Mix your own and help save the planet. Check out the nutrition here: [...]", "PowerBar Electrolytes (lemon flavor) is a nice refreshing drink that comes in convenient packets that allows you to avoid lugging around large plastic containers full of sports drinks.  The flavor is vaguely lemondadish but in a lemonade mix rather that natural sort of way.  The flavor was acceptable and on a hot day or after a workout would probably taste fine but the texture was somewhat grainy.  It's not something I would turn down if offered but I was not impressed enough to make it a summer staple.", "It tastes real,fresh and natural. Will definitely recommend it and buy it again. I think that is enough said.", "I feel pretty good after mixing this powder into my bottle of water and slurping it down. If it's as good as Gatorade but fewer calories, then I'm on board. A variety of flavors might have done better.", "I don't like many low calorie drinks because of the sugar substitute, but this one surprised me and tasted good. However, I had muscle spasms and cramps the same day I drank the electrolytes from this powder. Electrolytes are supposed to help prevent this, so this wasn't completely effective. My doctor also reported I was in dire need of replacing everything I lost while playing tennis or exercising. And this on the same day and day after trying two of these.But the fact it tastes good is a big deal. Something about sugar substitutes doesn't work for me, so it's nice having a flavored drink that isn't full of sugar and calories.Why use powder instead of a bottle? Several reasons: you may not want a whole bottle and plus you don't use up plastic bottles. With powder you can use a glass or reusable containers -- so it's better for the environment. Many tennis courts have cold water stations, so I can always have cold water instead of dealing with a plastic bottle that goes warm too quickly. I usually bring my reusable water bottle and drink it from there.", "This is a small tube of drink mix made to stick in your pocket and add to your water during or after your workout. It's really tasty - a bit like lemonade mixed with the original flavor of Gatorade. It's easy to carry and mixes very easily. Just pour it in your water, close the lid and shake. It helps balance your electrolytes and could be an important part of preventing dehydration or worse when you're exerting yourself. This would also be great for anyone who works outdoors in the summer or is very physically active. I'd buy it again.", "The main problem is the taste, which is bad.  So, bad I found it impossible to finish the beverage.  I do not think Gatorade tastes bad to give you a comparison. Otherwise, I love to packets so that you don't have to by a bottle drink every day."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030702093616127968, 0.031479813158512115, 0.030964117497205734, 0.03719713166356087, 0.030605344101786613, 0.031197894364595413, 0.030766306445002556, 0.032116156071424484, 0.032701525837183, 0.02845422737300396, 0.030230967327952385, 0.03261999040842056, 0.033570997416973114, 0.029588347300887108, 0.028518522158265114, 0.030498217791318893, 0.04341255873441696, 0.02995883673429489, 0.032515913248062134, 0.0311726126819849, 0.033549368381500244, 0.02743959240615368, 0.029993874952197075, 0.03124646097421646, 0.02405420131981373, 0.029900982975959778, 0.03291460871696472, 0.031528767198324203, 0.030801987275481224, 0.02523716166615486, 0.030214257538318634, 0.034847136586904526]]}
