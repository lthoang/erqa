This is a massive change during just the series' sophomore release. It's definitely more enjoyable than the first, but functions and character controls are still limited under excessive developments in graphic improvements and various effects.", "There is an argument that games can be a truly transformative and liberating artform, a way of transmitting ideas and narratives and developing characters in ways that traditional film and literature cannot hope to match. There is also an argument that, whilst that is true, games should also seek new ways of including as many ludicrous explosions and insane stunts as possible whilst allowing the player to go mental with an Uzi whilst dangling from a helicopter. Just Cause 2 is the ultimate exploration of the latter idea.The setting is the island-nation of Panau, which stretches across a massive 400 square kilometres. For the record, that's thirty times the size of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and twenty-five times the size of Skyrim. It's an absolutely massive environment taking in frozen, snow-blown mountains, burning deserts and lush, tropical jungle, as well as the skyscraper-strewn metropolis of Panau City. Playing as Rico, you can use ground vehicles ranging from tuk-tuks to armoured personnel carriers (via sports cars, bikes and fire engines) as well as a variety of helicopters, boats, jet fighters and airliners. An arsenal of weaponry is available including submachine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades, explosives and Magnum-like hand cannons. Rico has a grappling hook which he can use to grab lifts on passing aircraft or cars (and then hijack them), or ascend to the roofs of buildings quickly. He can also use it as a weapon, pulling enemies off high ledges or - most entertainingly - attaching them to passing vehicles or exploding gas canisters.The game has a central storyline which is worthwhile enough, with a few good gags and a few satirical jabs aimed at American foreign policy, but it's mainly worth playing for the missions, which tend to be more epic and inventive than most of the game. The bulk of the game is spent playing missions for each of the three rebel factions, helping them expand their territory over larger portions of the maps. The faction missions are enjoyable, but tend to be brief and rather easy. Disappointingly, they also don't overlap. In fact, bizarrely, each of the three factions seems completely unaware of the existence of the others, even when their territory meets. The faction missions also just peter out in the end, with no big pay-off or final mission for each faction, which feels like a bit of missed opportunity.Where the game's true appeal lies is in its enormous open world. The game scores everything by how much chaos you cause. The more chaos you cause, the more missions, weapons and vehicles you unlock and more unstable the regime becomes. You cause chaos by completing missions but also destroying government property, such as petrol stations, oil depots and military bases. Sufficiently impressive explosions also add to your chaos score. In short, whilst going absolutely ballistically nuts in, say, a GTA game is a fun diversion, in Just Cause 2 it's part of the core game design. To get to 100% game completion, you need to pretty much destroy every single bit of government property on the map (which, given the map's overwhelming size, will take weeks, if not months) and pick up every single upgrade (since there's literally thousands of them, this will also take a while). To make this more achievable, the game breaks the completion score down by location and settlement, with each settlement having it's own sub-score so you know if you have to do more stuff there or can move on.This is the the core of Just Cause 2's appeal: going crazy and blowing everything up is built into the game design rather than being left as an optional extra, and makes the game more entertaining. Everything else, even the missions, are designed around this idea (so whilst doing a story mission in an enemy base, you may wish to simultaneously level the place and get all the upgrades to put it towards your overall score). This is useful as the main storyline, whilst amusing, is rather brief if you tear right through it.Visually, the game looks astonishing, even three years after release. The draw distances are staggering, the views of the islands are incredible either by day or night (and at night the sight of the lights of villages on the sides of mountains a dozen miles away is particularly evocative) and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. Each island is packed with towns, villages, remote homesteads, ruined temples and other features of interest. You could play this game for months and still never see all there is to see. It's bigger than many MMORPG worlds (Panau is five times the size of the entire planet in World of WarCraft, for example).Unfortunately, where Just Cause 2 does break down is repetition. The game world is enormous, but there is a limit on what you can do. In fact, whilst the game world is far vaster than any GTA game, you're still limited to blowing things up, doing story missions or taking part in races. GTA4's attempts to give you more stuff to do through bowling, mini-games etc may have been fairly naff, but at least it was an attempt to give the player more activities to pursue in its open world (something GTA5 sounds like it will improve on further). It's unlikely that many players will get to 100% completion in Just Cause 2 because to do so would involve attacking dozens and dozens of near-identical military bases, exploring dozens and dozens of near-identical towns and villages and base-jumping around lots of very similar skyscrapers in the city, whilst having to painstakingly explore every nook and cranny to make sure you haven't missed a hidden upgrade crate. The game world is vast, huge and overwhelmingly impressive, but it will eventually get a little stale. This will vary by player, and for me it didn't happen until almost 35 hours in the game and 40% completion (accomplished by completing every faction and storyline mission, destroying almost twenty military bases and generally causing lots of random havoc). Certainly there is more than enough game here for your money, enhanced further on the PC version by both the more lush visuals and the impressive multiplayer mode (added by modders).Just Cause 2 (****) is a big, dumb and amusing game set in possibly the greatest environment ever created for a game. Some might wish for a stronger narrative, or more variance in the missions and locations, but as an open-world sandbox designed for having fun, Just Cause 2 is now the game to beat.", "I got Just Cause 2 for an incredibly low price in the last Steam Winter sale, but since my aging Gaming PC has trouble keeping a steady frame rate, I figured it would be worth re-buying for 360 now that the game is on sale. Definitely worth it.", "\"The first \"\"Just Cause\"\" game was released way back in 2006 on both sixth and seventh-generation platforms.  As a result, it had its fair share of problems that ultimately affected the overall quality and enjoyment, which of course led to the game not selling a lot of copies.  However, four years later, in 2010, \"\"Just Cause 2\"\" was released exclusively for the seventh-gen, and it is so amazing and polished, it makes the first game look like it was released in the stone age.  JC2 is stuffed to the gills with everything you could ever want: innovative technology, amazing graphics, over-the-top situations, jaw-dropping size, upgradable weapons, and some of the best physics ever created.  It more than deserves the Platinum Certification it proudly earned.Completely unrelated to the story of the first game, JC2 takes place on the fictional South Pacific island of Panau, where a US-friendly president has been assassinated by his son, who has installed an oppressive dictatorship.  To make matters worse, a high-level operative who works for \"\"The Agency\"\" (no, really, that's what it's actually called) has disappeared on the island, and is presumed rogue.  As sexy Hispanic agent Rico Rodriguez, your official job is to infiltrate Panau, discover if the operative is rogue or still Agency-friendly, and hopefully assassinate the new Panauan dictator.  Your unofficial job is to cause as much chaos and destrution as possible without giving a crap.One of the most enjoyable aspects about JC2 is that it completely revels in being larger than life, impractical, and over the top.  The very first mission has you base-jumping out of a heliopter after a dead body, hanging on to the bottom of the helicopter while shooting enemies one-handed, and using a massive SAM site to obliterate a government military installation.  The very last mission involves you fighting the dictator on top of launched nuclear cruise missiles while you grapple to different missiles mid-air to input abort codes into their guidance computers.  This game is like the most unrealistic James Bond movies all jacked up on anabolic steroids.  In fact, you are actually unable to progress in the game's story until you cause a certain level of chaos, whether that be destroying government property, killing civilians, entering restricted areas, or assassinating high-ranking army officers.The other enjoyable aspect of JC2 is your special grapple hook.  It's by far the most valuable tool in the game, and it lets you rapidly zip through the air to cross gaps and scale buildings.  You can also use it in combination with your parachute to keep yourself in the air while you travel.  Additionally, you can use it to pull enemies off high ledges and send them falling to their deaths.  Not only can you use it on humans, but you can also use it on vehicles too, which comes in handy for flipping over pursuing cars and Humvees.  Nothing beats the satisfaction of grappling up to an assault helicopter, throwing the pilot out, and then using it to destroy everything else in sight.The weapon system mechanics are also astoundingly well-done.  You can carry two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon, and you're able to dual-wield both one-handed weapons at the same time.  This provides remarkable versatility for combat with both foot soldiers and vehicles.  Ammo can be restocked by simply walking over downed enemies' weapons, or purchased through the black market.  As you progress through the game, you're also able to upgrade your weapons, enhancing aspects like damage, clip size, and fire rate.\"", "This game has it all as FPS's go. You can drive, fly and go on water. You have the most wide assortment of weapons to choose from and you can also grapple onto moving objects. The game overall is a lot of fun. There is only one setback I know about and that is if you put a lot of hours on the game it has a tendency to lockup.", "\"If you've looked at the stock market recently, you know things aren't looking too good.Fortunately, JUST CAUSE 2 (JC2) offers a fun \"\"game world\"\" for you to escape to!Now considering inflation and the pathetic minimum wage, don't you feel that a game should be worth that hefty price tag? This is one game where I definitely feel I am getting my money's worth! To put it in perspective, I played 30 hours of FINAL FANTASY XIII and had nowhere near as much fun as with this game.I am only 20% complete with JC2, but have already surpassed 30 hours of game time!Am I bored yet?No.Why?-- You can do missions for 3 different factions at any time you want.-- You can liberate villages (and sometimes it's just a matter of finding all the powerup crates).-- You can liberate military bases.-- You can walk, extract, drive ground vehicles, choppers, boats, aircraft, motorcycles and utilize the parachute/grapple.-- You can hijack any vehicle, even if it's in motion!-- You can upgrade weapons and armor. Yes, the bad guys are hard to kill, but they do have body armor. The civilians die more readily.-- You can explore the whole huge map right from the get-go!-- You can find Easter Eggs like an homage to the LOST series.-- You can play this game for short bursts of time if you have a busy life -- and still have a blast!-- My top 5 things to do:1) Take off in a jet, towing a car behind me2) Making the bells fall down in the bell towers3) Driving a limo through the jungle during a mission, with baddies on your tail . . . and still making it to the safehouse intact.4) Headshots. About 1/3 of all my kills have been headshots. The other third melee and the final third is just plain sloppy shooting.5) Poke fun at BolO San TOE Si's craaaaazy accent!On that note, yeah, the storyline is nothing special and the voice acting is funny, but it was obviously meant to be that way. This game is not trying to be \"\"ueber-realistic\"\". The most realistic part of it are the graphics. My goodness! They really need a camera item for this game so Rico can take pictures of the game world.The flight controls are a little hard to get used to, but after awhile it almost feels like they grafted ACE COMBAT into the game!The only other cons I have:-- The HEAT levels are a bit inconsistent. And why is it that every time I walk into a village, even if I don't do anything, violence breaks out between the locals and the Panaun Army?-- I'm playing this on a 50\"\" screen projected by an HD20 Optoma projector. Even at this size, the text on the map legend is hard to read.-- A few glitches where you can't reach 100% for an area. This seems to be due to blowing things up from too far away.Well, I think that about wraps up this review -- it's cutting into my time with this game! Play it!\"", "Just Cause 2 is truly one of the best sandbox games I've played. The last game which gave me this much fun in an open world was Crackdown and GTA:San Andreas. I love just driving around in JC2 or just fly around in a chopper or a fast fighter jet or just go to the top of a mountain and basejump down or cause general mayhem tethering baddies in their cars to bridges or roads via the grapple hook. That part is especially fun - cause chaos, await baddies on a bridge, tether their car to the bridge when they approach you. Watch in glee as they get caught on the grapple hook and get yanked back and fly off the bridge.Or hook up bad guys to the tops of tall buildings and dangle them from the top and watch as they fall down to their doom while cursing and bellowing in cheesy accents.Fun times.This game is worth a purchase.", "I missed this one on release and it got placed in my backlog, just got around to getting it and am about 15 hours in so far. Loving the game, very interesting, sort of like Mercenaries, but your character has a Spiderman-like zip line shot. The world is huge, non-linear, more so that Grand Theft because you do not have to unlock zones. There are two major flaws IMO, one is the lack of destructible buildings, and two, there is no way to save vehicles. I still give it a 4 star for fun, and because I only paid 25 USD for it, but it really is a 3.5 star game overall.", "The voice acting is funny at best. The story is a bit ridiculous. But the gameplay is amazing!!! Such a large open world to explore that you will quickly forget about the downfalls and just have fun with it. Being able to parachute around the island is awesome. It took awhile to get down the fighting, kinda like GTA it never felt just right. But overall a great experience and I hope they make another one soon.Graphics are good and I didn't run into many glitches through the game.", "\"The first Just Cause was a somewhat ambitious, but rather flawed open-world game, with a military theme.  Essentially, you played as Rico Rodriguez, a rather obvious parody of an Antonio Banderas-style gunslinger character, given the mission of bringing down the government of a banana republic.  The game was built around the conceit of engaging in crazy stunts, liberating towns and bases, and generally shooting things up in the largest open-world environment in an action game to date.  However, the game was brought down by some glaring issues, not the least of which was that the huge world (essentially an entire island nation) was not only somewhat visually repetitive, but was also a major pain to get around.  Driving from one location to the other using the floaty-feeling vehicles was tough enough, but if you got stranded on foot in the middle of nowhere, things got worse, with near vertical hillsides everywhere blocking your route (not to mention the vast bays and inlets).That being said, I knew the franchise had potential and ambition to spare.  While early rumors indicated the sequel would take place in an oversized version of your typical open-world city environment, these thankfully proved to be unfounded as early development pictures leaked out.  The hype grew and grew in my mind, and as videos were parsed out over time, this looked like it could have been the military action title I had always wanted.  While it didn't turn out quite as perfect as I had dreamed (and that's at least partly my fault due to my unrealistic expectations), the game is truly a major leap in terms of sandbox gaming due to what are the major cornerstones of this game: control, chaos, and scope.  Just Cause 2 does not care about having \"\"character depth\"\" and \"\"compelling story\"\" bullet-points; rather, the focus is on delivering an over-the-top, unpredictable, adrenaline filled experience, geared towards old-school arcade values, mixed with modern technology and accessibility.What story there is revolves around Rico heading into the island dictatorship of Panau, somewhere in the Asian Pacific, with the mission of finding Tom Sheldon (your boss from the first game), who is suspected of \"\"going rogue\"\", after falling out of contact with the Agency.  Of course, things aren't going to be that easy, given that the country's dictator, Baby Panay, doesn't particularly like armed foreigners prancing around the place.  To that end, you have been given new tools: a Bionic Commando-inspired grappling hook \"\"gauntlet\"\", that you can deploy at any time with the bress of a button (without having to switch over to it), combined with an infinitely re-deployable parachute.  This combination turns out to be pure genius, as once you get the hang of it, you can essentially keep mobile constantly, by using such techniques as the \"\"grapple-catapult\"\" to get yourself airborned, while also using the improved \"\"stunt\"\" skills, such as being able to hang onto the front of an occupied jeep (or even an airborne helicopter!), and shoot around the side, as further means to keep the action going.  The vehicles themselves still control a bit rough, but finally have enough weight and feel to them to not be just a \"\"necessary evil\"\".All this control comes in handy, as a means to create \"\"Chaos\"\", which is the stat that unlocks missions and new weapons.  There are 3 shady \"\"factions\"\" for you to work for, and much of the game's mission content involves missions for those factions.  Sadly, the required Agency missions are far too few in number, and as a result, the Faction missions are too essential to the game's content to be considered \"\"side missions\"\".  While some of the Faction missions are very simple \"\"blow this up\"\" or \"\"kill that guy\"\", there are some real standouts, including a mission involving stopping Panau's military space program, a mission located in a base straight out of \"\"Goldeneye\"\", and a very bizarre mission on an isolated, storm-wracked island. However, much of the fun in the game simply comes from the constant stream of chaotic destruction that occurs.  Your grapple can link together 2 vehicles, pull enemy soldiers off of high catwalks, or even shoot a line between two soldiers, causing them to get pulled into each other.  Aside from missions, you can cause chaos by \"\"completing\"\" settlements by destroying government property and stealing \"\"upgrade\"\" boxes (you can gain vehicle, weapons, and armor upgrade points), or by assassinating well-guarded colonels, and there are races for earning cash as well.All of this takes place in a ridiculously huge, and surprisingly varied environment.  There are hundreds of settlements, military bases, and other locations to discover, and to keep things from getting dull, Avalanche made Panau more varied than San Esperito from the last game.  You'll find jungles, deserts, snow-covered mountains, beaches, mangrove deltas, oil rigs, villages, ancient ruins, and a huge metropolis large enough that it sprawls across several small islands.  The graphics are ridiculously colorful, and the lighting can be often described as stupendous.  While things are a bit cartoony, given the huge environment (much bigger than all the Grand Theft Auto games combined, but still smaller than Fuel), I'm more than happy with the way it looks.  Wisely, the developers give you a \"\"quick trip\"\" option to any of the named locales on the map you have discovered, although it doesn't open up until you've done a couple of the Faction missions.  And speaking of map issues, unlike San Esperito's endless and confusing sea of green, blue, and brown, Panau is designed in such a way that you'll have a much easier time keeping your bearings, as there's usually a distinctive landmark or vista nearby.As good as the game is, I still have some gripes.  While you can hijack jets and tank-like vehicles, enemy fighter pilots are apparently unable to work the weapons systems, and army drivers don't know how to drive the tanks either (sometimes they'll jump into the gunner's seat of a parked APC at a base, but not much more than that).  For a game centered around military action, this is kind of a major letdown.  In addition, the game could've used more missions, and for whatever reason, Avalanche has decided not to bother with mission expansions via DLC (and even though I generally don't like DLC, I'd pay for a solid, major mission pack for JC2).  There are also still a number of odd bugs floating around the game (such as the infamous \"\"no civilians\"\" bug).  Another downer is the overall sparse population of the game environment, although I can see why in terms of cutting down on performance issues.  Finally, to truly displace Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the game would need much more variety in terms of additional \"\"side missions\"\" and ownership of property/vehicles.But overall, this game, while not the \"\"uber-game\"\" I was hoping it would be, is still EXTREMELY entertaining.  This takes the \"\"chaos-creation\"\" element from the GTA series to a new level, combines it with a military theme, and provides you with the level of control needed to keep things constantly moving.  On the other hand, the game environment is enchanting enough that a mellow, relatively violence-free trip through Panau is worthwhile.  I've put in well over 100 hours into this game, and still feel the need to revisit it.  Hopefully, Just Cause 3 will keep all the good elements, and tweak the weak spots.\"", "\"Greetings Amazonites!Just Cause 2 is a blast to play!  If you're looking for some downright fun action, then this is the game for you.  Step right up to my patented 3-tier review system.ENVIRONMENTS (5 stars): Wow... just wow.  This game looks amazing.  Everything in the world is eye candy--the buildings, trees, grass, rocks, buildings, characters, vehicles, etc, etc... You name it and the developers made sure it was pleasing to look at.  I really don't know how they managed to cram so much detail into a game and still make loading times transparent.  I'm not even sure there is any loading time!  I've journeyed across the world numerous times and never had the game stop to load anything.  Everything seems to just be there, ready to see.The game world, in my opinion, is vast.  There's something like 35 square miles of land in the game.  You can really feel the scale of the world by flying around in a helicopter.  It actually takes some time to get somewhere far away (there is a fast travel option, however).  I'm blown away at the combination of scale and detail.  There's variety in landscape, as well: beaches, ocean, mountains, snow, jungle, cliffs--it's all here.The sound and music is superb.  Every bullet shot, explosion, and rain drop sounds great.  The music is simple and creates a great atmosphere without beint distracting: some good, rhythmic tunes to keep the action upbeat.GAMEPLAY (3 stars): the controls are good and responsive; if you played any other 3rd-person action games, this won't be too much of a problem.  The camera is excellent as well; it frames the action well and doesn't get in the way.  There were a few moments where I would've liked to play in 1st-person, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin the game.  The 3rd person is all about preference.  Sometimes I find it disorienting when you're trying to change directions or look around--the camera and the character don't always look in the same direction.Managing items, vehicles, and inventory is easy.  Everything is mapped to the direction pad for quick access.  You can tap a direction or hold it down to change weapon configurations.  Using a parachute or grappling hook is a quick tap of a shoulder or face button.  There's no unwieldy inventory screen to scroll through--everything can be switched and configured in the game HUD.  This is a brilliant system that keeps you in the game.One of the strongest things in the game is the parachute and grappling hook combination.  You can jump off cliffs, pull the chute, and glide for miles at a time.  You can grapple hook the ground or a tree and keep your momentum, cruising the land in your chute.  It's quite a sight.  The hook also allows you to scale buildings, attach to helicopters (and take it over), grab vehicles (and hijack them), and attach people to objects (like a moving vehicle).  There are a slew of combinations these gadgets can be used for; you'll feel like a combination of Rambo and Batman!The weakest part of the game--and it can be frustrating sometimes--is the shooting.  The aiming system feels a little awkward at time.  You'll burn through a lot of bullets just spraying enemies.  You can zoom in and aim, but it's not practical when you're getting shot by multiple opponents.  It's simpler just to hold the trigger and let the lead fly.  Aiming seems very \"\"from the hip\"\" regardless of the weapon used.  The difference between the weapons doesn't feel as strong as it should be; head shots work for all weapons, but it seems like there's little difference between an assault rifle and a pistol when just shooting normally.  Fortunately, the frantic action often distracts from the unwieldly aiming.Vehicle operation is another sore spot.  It's fun to take control of cars, trucks, bikes, copters, boats, and everything in between--but it can be a chore to drive.  Aside from acceleration and top speed, most vehicles drive the same.  The steering is odd; it feels to easy to oversteer and too hard to turn sharp corners--even with a slower vehicle.  Helicopters and boats are the easiest to manage, but they can get cumbersome when you're being chased or moving at top speed.  Just like the aiming, the vehicles don't ruin the game--they're just not good.DESIGN (5 stars): The game is all about bringing down the corrupt government of Panau.  Something sinister is afoot--a conspiracy of international proportions.  The main character, Rico, is a specialist in causing chaos.  That becomes the focus of the game: blowing stuff up, assassinating key figures, and just making life difficult for the government.  It's a lot of fun, too.New weapons, upgrades, vehicles, and so on are accessed through an unusual method: you call a black market dealer, who flies to your position and drops the items to you.  It sounds a little corny, but it works quite well.  It makes a lot more sense than trying to find shops in a country where you're destroying stuff!The map is very well done and full of information.  Each location has an icon (like many other games) and highlighting an icon allows you to mark it as a compass direction and also calls up an information panel; the info panel tells you the basics of the site, what kind of rewards you can expect from it, and so on.  Each site has a combination of objects to destroy, people to kill, or treasures to find.  When you complete all the objectives for each site, you earn a bonus reward (normally points and/or cash).The story is actually pretty good.  You don't have to do any of the story-related missions at all!  This is one of the best things about Just Cause--you can, literally, do whatever you want.  There are all types of missions to choose from, and completing objectives opens up more choices.  Missions branch off of missions, depending on who you decide to work for.  Rico is a mercenary, and you can pick from any number of factions to aid; or you can just cruise around causing chaos, collecting rewards, and enjoying the scenery.The game has great appeal to guys, like me, who don't have a lot of game time.  It's fun to just fire up this game for an hour or two and revel in the chaos.  Take a quick half-hour dip into the world to raid a military base!  There's nothing like stealing a military assault helicopter and using it to demolish a secure military facility.\"", "This game is great and wacky.  It is just so huge and seems to go on forever.  You can spend about 15 hours just doing some jobs for factions and goofing around on the island and not even do a main story mission.  Then you realize you forgot to do it so you do it and afterward, a whole bunch more faction missions appear. This game is worth every penny because there is so much to do and it is so much fun.", "Graphics are very, very good, but the lighting and blurriness hurt your eyes, so I suggest you tone down your television picture settings. The gameplay is tons of fun, and there is way too much to do for the casual gamer. The physics are awesome, and the vehicles actually feel like they have weight. When you wreck, the  vehicle has actual velocity and force, especially when it rolls down a mountain(you have to try this). Driving is just fun. The shooting and the explosins are very fulfilling and very fun as well. Story and characters are bland, and it all feels generic. Doesn't feel like there is much life to the game. I suppose it can get a little repetitive, but so does GTA. The fun factor is through the roof though, and I kind of tend to forget about the negative and get lost doing random stuff in the game, like driving down mountains(YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS).", "\"Sandbox games have really advanced in the past few years, especially since the clones of GTA were released. Just Cause 2 is what I'd call the latest incarnation of the sandbox game. It is based on a fictional island nation in Southeast Asia, where you are looking for a rogue agent. Your task is to get in with the local revolutionaries and understand the big picture in Panau.Main PointsPositive-Insanely large, multi-faceted open world-Many different vehicles; planes, tanks, helicoptors, bikes, cars etc-Graphics are generally good and very believable-Pretty large weapons cache-Grappling hook and parachute makes the game feel like a 007 movie-Black market feature allows you to purchase vehicles and weapons anywhere on the islandNegative-Game is difficult even on casual-Ammo goes quickly, leaving you on a constant hunt for bullets (and health)-Main storyline is really short, probably 7-8 hours-Many sidequests and challenges are cookie-cutter and can get repetitive-Vehicles are far from realistic i.e. cars don't handle well, planes are slowMap - 9 of 10The size of the playable area of Just Cause 2 is mind-bendingly large. It is claimed to be 400 square miles according to the scale. And I'm inclined to believe it. The map is so diverse, expansive and realistic. There are numerous airports, military bases, settlements, skyscrapers and cityscapes to name a few. In fact, there are 368 distinct locations to explore on Panau. Topography is impressive as well, including hundreds of miles of coastline, mountains, deserts, rivers, jungles and even a Zeppelin which has a night club underneath. My only real qualm with the map is that it is so big that even with planes it will take you a good 10 minutes to traverse the full map. This makes use of a car almost pointless.Gameplay 7 of 10As an agent for some secret US security team you are basically the best at what you do, which is apparently cause havoc. You're equipped with two very important items: a grappling hook and an infinite number of parachutes attached to your back. Any number of things can be achieved with the parachute/grappling hook combo. You can shoot far away from yourself and pull out the parachute launching yourself into the air. You can scale a mountain with only the hook. You can attach the hook to enemies pulling them towards you. It allows for a very creative gaming experience. This is what separates Just Cause 2 from other similar sandbox games. In fact it makes me think of a James Bond movie every time I jump out of a plane.It's clear, however that the developers fully intended for you to do A LOT of piddling around the country, because there are only seven main storyline missions. The number of sidequests with the local guerrillas is probably around 100. These take maybe 10-15 minutes each. The problem with the sidequests is there are so many that they start to run together and can get really repetitive. If you really want to explore in depth (and get the achivements), you'll go to each settlement and cause chaos. This includes destroying any number of government installations such as fuel tanks, SAM sites, statues, radars, generators - you get the picture. A bunch of achievements are associated with \"\"finishing\"\" a settlement. This means getting all the parts located in the settlement and destroying everything necessary.My biggest problem with the game is definitely the difficulty of the game, which is considerable in my opinion. There are four levels of difficulty and I'm on the lowest one - casual. On most shooter games, the lowest level of difficulty means that I'll never die. And I've been killed at least a dozen times by enemies. You'll be swarmed constantly. That's not the ridiculous part either. I've been killed that many times with the fifth level of armor equipped. It appears that even though I've leveled my armor, that it really doesn't provide any extra protection. The same thing seems to happen with the guns. Leveling them up is so marginal, that you'll have to take the weapon to the max level to notice the difference. What really bothers me is this: you have four levels of heat or your wanted level. The number of guys that attack you isn't based your heat level. You'll face basically the same amount of enemies on level 1 as on level 4. The only real difference on the higher levels is that they'll pursue you more.Vehicles 7 of 10This part of the game definitely needed more work. Though there are 104 different vehicles including planes (some armed), tanks, helicopters and cars. Many of them have control problems. Sports cars are touchy to the point of being almost impossible to drive at high speeds. And the weight of the vehicles is far from realistic as even hitting a small bump could send your vehicle hurling end over end. That being said, there is a great variance of the types of vehicles you can drive and what can be done to them. One of the more impressive parts of the game was the ability to upgrade vehicles and weapons via the Black Market. As you go through the game you'll find vehicle parts and weapon parts which can be used to increase speed, handling, acceleration etc. But only the vehicles on the Black Market list can be upgraded, which is less than 20 total.Along with that, the air vehicles are astonishingly slow. I figured out that the fastest plane on the game will only do about 250 mph. You might say it's fine for a game, but until you see the size of the map, you won't understand.Graphics 7 of 10Visuals on the people in Just Cause 2 are average, probably at best. But the rest of the map is gorgeous. Textures are very detailed and have the brilliance of a plethora of colors. Water in particular has a reflective quality I've only seen in a few other games. In fact, the ocean floor is littered with rocks, seaweed and reefs. The most amazing part about the graphics is that there are no loading times while you're just walking around the island. Animation is very smooth and for the most part realistic.ConclusionJust Cause 2 takes the size of a sandbox to levels never before reached. It is a fun mess around game where you could drop hours just exploring or just do a couple of missions and quit. The sheer size of the map is something that anyone who's into sandbox games should see. So here's the gist of it: very good weapons cache, ability to upgrade vehicles and weapons, grappling hook and parachute make the game quite unique, tons of stuff to do and beautiful scenery as well. Unfortunately, the sidequests can get repetitive and the difficulty will definitely turn more casual gamers away. Also, most of the non-flying vehicles seem almost superfluous because of the size of the map. So it's not a perfect game by any means, but has probably a good 50-70 hours of playtime which not a whole lot of games can say they have.\"", "\"This is one of those games that I missed last year, (I was busy with Red Dead Redemption, Black Ops, etc); was sort of curious about (I played and liked the first one), but finally picked up because some people that I know, that are pretty serious gamers, were saying good things about it, and the reviews were pretty favorable. I thought, well, it's not 60 bucks anymore; why not give it a try.I am VERY glad that I did. This game has a HUGE map (biggest I have seen; as big as Oblivion GTA San Andreas, GTAIV, etc are, this is bigger than probably all those games and more COMBINED, I mean, seriously), there are TONS of things to do, all sorts of vehicles, main story missions, faction missions, probably thousand of locations (cities, towns, villages, settlements) to explore for \"\"weapon parts\"\" \"\"auto parts\"\" \"\"armor parts\"\" and so on (these are the games version of \"\"Hidden Packages), and you can do whatever you want, and kill whomever you want--in fact that is the POINT OF THE GAME, to cause as much mayhem and destruction (\"\"CHAOS\"\" as the game calls it), that you can! Causing \"\"CHAOS\"\" actually advances your character--as you perpetrate the mayhem, this unlocks future missions, sort of like \"\"respect\"\" does in the Saints Row games. You are especially rewarded for destroying structures, vehicles, antennas, sat dishes, etc, marked as government property. Who wouldn't find THAT fun, lol. Kill a few civilians in a town of any size? The military responds and tries to take you out. I especially like finding a gas station, making the pumps blow up, and then fighting the government goons that show up.There IS a story line, that sort of continues the one from the last game, but the story really, here, is secondary. Your object, again, is to cause mayhem and destruction to unlock more missions. When you are on a main or \"\"Agency\"\" mission, this advances the story. Other missions are for the factions, you help various gangs take over sectors of the island (I guess so that they can eventually control enough to over throw the dictator, but I haven't got that far yet), when you aren't on any kind of mission, it's basically free roam--you knock someone off their motorcycle, grab their car or whatnot, and wander around randomly causing as much death  and destruction as you can, and exploring every where for those \"\"packages.\"\" I found one thing called an \"\"air challenge\"\" where you jump into a single engine tail dragger plane, and try to fly through a course of markers in the air. I missed the third one, said the heck with it, and flew around for awhile looking at the area. By the way, there are numerous airports! I found one, landed there, (It turned out to be Panua international). It gave me credit for finding the location. But now, I was like where the hell am I? lolOne thing though, this map is HUGE. I know I keep saying that, but until you see it you won't believe it. It can take a LONG time to go from one end to the other. Even with a car, (or better a copter or plane), it will take a LONG TIME. By the way the zip line and parachute are still in the game. See a low flying helicopter? Zip line it, and jack it! If it's a military one, attack things with it!Now, I have to mention the ONLY thing I DON'T like about this game. The ONLY thing. THE SAVE SYSTEM. The way it works is, when you are on a mission, there is auto save, that makes \"\"checkpoints\"\" for you (SIGH. DAMN IT). So, if you die, and you will, (this game is fun, but it is NOT necessarily easy---you are usually outnumbered with not that much ammo, relatively), the game takes you back to your previous check point. The problem with \"\"check points\"\" is they don't save every thing you have done, found, etc between them. So back to the last check point, start all over from you were. GOD that is ANNOYING. Once you do get to the NEXT one, then whatever you accomplished is saved, but not until then. There are \"\"save slots\"\" but this is NOT  a quick save. If you are on a mission, and try to load your manual save, you will start the the last checkpoint, with nothing new saved. If you are NOT on a mission, the manual save will usually save any progress in the statistics that it follows, but you will NOT spawn were you left off, you will appear back at the nearest \"\"safe location\"\" to wherever you were. If you DIE outside a mission, the game will auto save any new things you found, changes to your stats, etc. But again, you will spawn at the closest \"\"base.\"\" Quite frankly, if it were not for this, the game would have got 5 stars from me, not 4. But I cannot, in this day and age, understand why we cannot have a quick save, that will save what you have done, and start you back at the location that you were last. Ugh.But with all that said, this is probably the most fun \"\"sandbox\"\" game I have ever played. It is the PERFECT game for, if you don't have too long to play, if you don't care that much about story line/completion, etc, or if you just want to put the disc in and see how much destruction you can cause before they kill you.HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! DON'T MISS IT ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE!\"", "While you might play a crime boss or street gang boss Just Cause 2 will make yo feel like you are playing a James Bond like sequel to those games.  While you might not be able to customize your character in this game like in Saints Row the main quests and mini quest as well as the explosion and mayhem more then make up for that.  The vast free raoming quality is also nice as while you do have the main quest you are required to build up your reputation and like with GTA or SR you do that by getting in good with the various bosses around the small island until you can proceed further along in the main quest.  The graphics and effect are amazing but since this is from Square Enix thta shouldn't come to much as a surprise.  Also your character does come with a bonus action figure attachment which is a short/long range grappling hook accessory that allows him to scale walls and other near impossible surfaces by foot or to grapple an opponent and pull them too you or make them fall,especially useful when you have a shooter across from you and you're out of ammo. The voice cast are B-movie level at the most while not bad some of them could have been a little better but still overall the game still is entertaining.  For the price of the game I'd say this is one that you'll probably enjoy adding to your gaming library.", "I have gotten so many hours of game play out of this game. A large sandbox map with lots of missions and a lot of things to do. My son at 13 enjoyed it so much on my PS3 that he asked for it for Christmas.Not really sure why it is rated M. There really isn't much that is that objectionable in it. There might be some swearing in some cut scenes. The gore is minimal although you are shooting other humans (or running them over in cars, trucks, firetrucks, jet airliners...).He likes to pronounce the name Just 'Cuz.. Why are you causing all of this mayhem? Just 'cuz...", "I cannot say I have finished this game, but I have put some considerable time into it....at least enough to know this is one of the more entertaining sandbox games in some time; the ways you can navigate this huge world is amazing and allows you to be highly creative. Your grappling hook and parachute actually become some of your best weapons, whether pulling yourself out of an intense firefight just before you die or pulling a foe down from his tower to meet his demise; you actually kind of become a militant Spiderman in many ways.The graphics are pretty amazing for a game of this scope; The weapon upgrades and helicopter assistance is nice, esp in traveling, which was a huge issue for the first game; the kill, chaos, and $ stats that pop up during your rampages is a pretty fun addition and gives it an arcade-like feel once you get on a roll. The gunplay can be intense at times, and the over the shoulder view can put you right in the middle.So far the missions and exploring have not gotten old or repetitious; I could see how after 80 hours your could feel otherwise....I am at about 25-30 hours and am enjoying it a lot; the time flies by, and exploring is just as fun.....from the sea to the snow, there are some nice landscapes just to appreciate. Skydiving provides some awesome views, too....The controls seems a little strange during the first tutorial missions, but once you get the feel of it, you will be slinging and shooting in no time. Never tires hijacking helicopters.Bottom line is that this is a really well made and enjoyable sandbox game; Certainly a lot of bang for your buck, esp considering some games only give you 10-20 hours of play, unless they are are online of course too.I don't know how well this would have worked online, but I am thankful the single player mode is as amazing as it is. If there was one complaint so far, it is just that this game is too big. So I guess it's a good complaint, esp nowadays where you want your video game $ going into something good and something that lasts or has high replay. This prob has both, if you can finish it once.", "\"\"\"While its a late comer the graphics are absolutely second to none and some of the best in 2010.
