Upon opening the box I was able to get it connected to my wireless network with less than five minutes. It also automatically found and upgraded the firmware. It took more time to set the clock on the unit than to connect to my network.The touch screen is OK. The first thing you do is calibrate it. I found it to be off a few times after calibration but think you just need to hit the buttons with more pressure. The thing I did like about the `frame' was being able to watch web TV and radio. What is great about it is you can pick any country to watch TV and radio! Growing up in Germany I opted to watch German channels and the picture was not bad. However, I kept losing my connection and it would reboot the frame. I lost my wireless connection a lot but never lost my connection on my laptop.The sound is OK but not great. It does not go that high but it has a decent clear sound. Now the biggest issue for me was seeing how pictures looked on this `frame'. I loaded up the same photos I have on my iPod touch, the pictures are very clear on my iPod touch. When viewing the same photos on the frame I was not as impressed. It seemed grainy and just not as clear as I expected it to be. Over all it is a nice internet frame but think it could have better and more useful features to it. It is nice but not super.Last I was surprised at the plastic that holds the frame up. It is flimsy and I think with the frame being a bit heavier that a sturdier frame holder would be helpful. Over all a nice internet frame but did not 'wow' me. It has potential and hope they are able to make a few upgrades to the unit.", "First I want to mention the great customer service I received from InTouch. When I received my InTouch IT7150 7-inch WiFi Digital Frame I was disappointed that I received the European AC plug adapter with my unit. I quickly called the customer service number included in the box and they sent me the correct plug and I received in within days. They even called me back to make sure I got it. So for customer service I give them 5 stars.The frame itself is very lightweight, sleek looking and has amazing picture quality with vivid colors. The audio sounds great for being a digital frame. I would of expected the audio to be low and scratchy but it sounds crystal clear to my surprise. Portability is a great option but keep in mind the battery life is between 1.5 and 2 hours until it has to be recharged. This makes it nice to take along at family or friend get-to-gethers and share new pictures of my family.Internet connection was quite simple to do. It found my home network automatically and all I had to do is enter my password/keyphrase. I was able to add different applications from Frame Channel after setting up a free account. I added the local weather station, Facebook, Flickr, and Woot. There are many applications to suit anybody's preferences.Listening to music and watching video feeds from all over the world is pretty neat. The videos are somewhat choppy but it is still a neat to watch how music videos are done across the world.Another great feature is being able to program the frame to turn on and off at a specific time. Since I ended up taking the frame to my office, I programmed the frame to turn on when I arrived and turn off when my day is done. The frame continuously plays all the pictures on I have on an SD card. The InTouch frame offers a variety of data input options. From SD, SDHC, MMC, MS, XD and CF cards to usb drive devices such as flash drives or to connect to a PC. It also offers an internal memory as well.When I first starting tapping the screen I was getting frustrated that it was not responding quickly to my touch. Once I adjusted the screen calibration it started working much better. I still have to double hit some options but it does respond. The one touch home mode button on the back of the unit makes it easier to navigate back home instead of tapping the back button repeatedly.The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is I wished the handle/rest bar was made of a more solid heavy duty material instead of plastic. I worry that it might break or crack easily.", "Technology keeps amazing me, whenever the next thing comes along, and this neat little device from Intouch is no exception.The Amazon description above is pretty comprehensive, so I won't talk about what it can do, I'll just say that it does it very well.A great easy to use touch screen makes operation a breeze, and if you're giving this as a gift, the hands free photo sharing through online providers, means Grandma can get weekly updates straight to her coffee table without ever touching a PC!My favorite, the internet Radio - loads of free stations with amazing digital clarity. I'm not a YouTube fan and rarely watch downloaded TV or movies, but for those that do, they will be well provided for.The price tag may put some people off, but this really is an amazing device. Sleek design, and looks good in any setting. A great conversation starter too. 5 stars!", "\"The Intouch IT7150 Wireless Picture Frame is a fairly advanced and feature rich multimedia device.  We already own several digital picture frames, ranging from very small to very large, but the IT7150 is far superior in both resolution and functionality to any of the other frames. Here are my observations:Pros -* Easy set up - Using the intuitive touch screen interface, I was able to get all of the basic functions working without reading the manual.* Very Sharp Display - The pictures and video are crisp and clear.* Good Speakers - The audio support was surprisingly good with the internal speakers, but there is also an earphone jack as well.* Many Input Options - Reads a variety of memory cards (including SD, SDHC, xD, and CF), USB Drives, and has internal memory.* Built in Wireless - Supports 802.11b (no problem with WEP) and allows for downloading pictures and content from on-line services (like Frame Network and Picasa - although only 5 at a time, see \"\"Cons\"\" below) or your home computers (if set up for sharing).* Supports RSS Feeds - Great for getting news, sports, and technology updates* Plays Internet Radio and Web TV - A really cool feature that give you access to thousands of radio, TV, and Web Cam channels! Listening to Celtic Music from a radio station in Ireland or watching the Smithsonian National Zoo \"\"Panda Cam\"\" on this frame is really amazing! Access to three CSPAN channels and two NASA TV channels is also pretty cool!* Portable - Has a rechargeable battery.* Good Tech Support - The Tech Support (accessed via a Toll Free number) answered within 3 minutes, was very knowledgeable, and addressed my questions on the first call.Cons -* Advanced Features Can Be Difficult to Find and Configure - Some of the more advanced features require going several layers into the menu to find and configure. The menu interface gets significantly more complicated the deeper you go.* Limited Number of Photos Displayed From On-Line Picture Services - The frame will only download 5 pictures, regardless of the number that you have uploaded. I called Tech Support and they confirmed this was the case. Note: This is only an issue for the On-Line services, not when reading pictures from the internal memory or media cards/drives.* No Remote Control - Even some of the \"\"lower end\"\" digital frames I own come with a remote control and it would have been nice to have one with this advanced frame.There are a lot features built into this little wonder! I expect that over time there will be some that I never look at once the novelty wears off, but it is nice to know that they are available. This is a very high quality product and I expect to get many years of enjoyment out of it!Highly recommended!\"", "We are not technically advanced people, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to use the Intouch wireless frame with satisfaction. It turned out to be so easy to use and makes a fun talking point for guests. It has web TV, news feed, internet radio and is a digital picture frame. It has a rechargable battery and WI-FI enabled. It is fairly intuiitive to use. Sometimes you have to click on things a few times more than intented, but the quality is excellent. It is also very sleek looking. I'm not sure I would pay over $200 for it (since we do not tend to purchase fancy techno-things), but it sure is fun to have!", "This is best thought of as a very limited small computer with restricted functionality.  You can use it to get news, see photo slideshows, some webcams (National Zoo was fun for a few minutes), or listen to mp3 music.BUT, I don't recommend it.There are many things wrong with it: (1) Comes with 128MB memory, you have to use an add-on memory card to do anything useful with pictures or music.  128MB?!  Might have cost them $4 extra to add about 4GB.  (I bought an 8GB sd chip(2) The screen is surprisingly poor -- pictures that look bright and sharp on a good LCD look fuzzy and dull on this.  (3) The speakers are simply horrible, no other word for it.  They sound harsh, distorted, and range-limited.So save the money, put it towards a nice basic notebook, you'll get something 100x better for about 3x the price.", "This is the first WIFI frame I've found that works well enough to keep. Some history: I've purchased three other frames over the past two years. I returned my first WIFI frame last year (another brand) because it worked poorly. I've been waiting for a WIFI frame that worked well.Visually, this is a beautiful frame with a great image. Some of the Chinese frames are low resolution and don't look very good. You'll be pleased with the way this frame looks on your bedside table, mantle or desk, and the photographic images are beautiful. The black and aluminum design looks great on an executive desk or conference table. Note that this frame displays wider format photos without chopping. I give the frame five stars for performing its basic digital photo frame function so well.Audio sounds great for a small product. It won't rival a five hundred dollar Bose Wave, but you'll be pleased with the audio reproduction of video content.The touch screen works well, but the user interface isn't perfect. You'll press some buttons twice, and hit an occasional wrong button. I deducted one star for these minor issues.The WIFI function works. but not perfectly. I got it working within about 10 minutes the night it arrived, then it didn't connect the next morning. Tech support was fast and informed, and recommended a reset. This solved the problem. Minus one star for not documenting this simple solution and slight difficulty getting WIFI working. Please note that this frame supports my wireless access point with WPA security and silent SSID, so it will probably handle any WIFI setup.Next came pure delight: I pointed the frame at my Picasa account (free online photo storage from Google). There is a Picasa preset in the menu, so this only took 30 seconds to set up. Immediately, my online photos appeared on the screen! This is the kind of clean wireless & online integration I've been looking for. Plus one star for the delight factor. There's nothing like uploading photos from a computer anywhere in the world, and having them appear on this frame without having to touch it.Other details: The rechargeable battery lasts almost two hours. It would be nice if it lasted longer, but that would increase the cost, size and weight, so I'm satisfied now. The included power adapter is small and works fine.Overall: four stars for looking great and working well, with some minor issues.", "The screen on the Intouch IT7150 shows crisp photos. There are lots of options for cycling rates and transitions. Loading photos through the memory card reader and placing it on a slow cycle rate makes for an unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing frame. There are quite a few lower-cost frames that do the exact same thing.The special features of this frame are what are supposed to set it apart. It has internet connectivity, so it is able to show photos from facebook, flickr, and many other internet sites. The interface for setting this up is cumbersome, extremely difficult to understand, and very minimally customizable. I am well above average in my ability to understand and use electronic devices, especially if they make use of the internet, and after a few hours I was so frustrated with the internet photo features of this internet frame that I simply won't use them. I load my photos on a memory card and stick it in the back. The inconvenience of using the internet to display photos, renders this feature unusable for me.Radio: There are a wide number of free internet radio stations at this time (recent recording industry agreements may severely limit the number of stations broadcasting free internet radio) which this frame takes advantage of. Navigation through these stations is relatively easy, especially if you are familiar with the names of the stations and know what you're looking for. The frame can also play mp3s. So it can double as a simple sound system. Plug it into your stereo and you have a simple portal for digital media. Not an extremely robust system, but it works if you have no better options.Video: Poor playback quality, difficult to find anything you'd want to watch anyway. There are not near as many tv stations as there are radio on the internet and the tv stations that do exist, you pretty much wouldn't want to watch. So this feature for me, after playing around with it, is not going to be used.News: The user is able to view onscreen text versions of the news with a few photos. Pretty slow navigation. I think this feature is more gimmick than useful. If you have a computer, read it on there. If not, watch tv or read a paper.Overall: I feel that this frame does photo display from a memory card well. It does photo display from the internet well, only after long interaction with a very poor backend system. The rest of the features are more-or-less gimicks. I'd recommend, unless you will really take advantage of the radio/mp3 feature, that you just buy a frame with fewer extra features that can display photos just as well...save some money.", "I've never seen anything quite like this Intouch Wireless Frame.  I consider myself an 'early adopter' of tech gadgets, so this device intrigued me a bit.  It looks great!  I love the adjustable stand, plus the fit and finish are impeccable.  Now, on to the device itself:I really like the display of the frame, though I felt like I had to almost push my finger though the screen to get any response at all.  After a little trial and error, I realized that the screen requires a touch of about 1 full second.  The processor on board doesn't seem to be up to the task of the device, though.  It took numerous attempts to get the frame connected via WIFI, but once connected, the device came alive!  Well, sort of.  It takes a little while for the device (processor) to download data from sites, and there is no logical layout to the scrolling news information on the main screen.  You are forced to look at all forms of news - from BBC to Yahoo.  I have not been able to find a way to just include the news clips from my selected sources.Internet radio is cool!  You can play music and have a photo slide show playing all at once.  I haven't had the chance to try out Web Tv, but I really like the quick access to the calendar and time functions.  All in all, a good device but I think that being able to buy the average digital photo frame for $79.99 will make a few folks think twice about purchasing this one.  For the current price of this device plus $100.00, you could buy a nice netbook with a 160gb hard drive.  Still, for what it does, it's a fine product.", "\"This is one of a number of \"\"picture frame\"\" media devices - that's getting to be a pretty busy space. Like most picture frame devices, it's basically a low-end Windows CE-powered tablet. That means the interface is a little slow and not very flashy. The provided software is Windows-only. That said, Mac and Linux users are not left out in the cold as with many devices. More on that in a bit.The screen is far better than most picture frame devices. It's 800x480 pixels, and side-to-side the viewing angle is a full 180 degrees. Too often, these devices look lousy from side angles.The device takes many different media card formats, as well as USB flash drives. With all of them, format to FAT32 with MBR and you're all set. The flash formats are documented in the Amazon description. A nice, undocumented surprise is that it works just fine with a USB hard drive as well. I used a 320g USB drive without any issues.Something else that you would expect with a Windows CE-powered device is that it plays music. Yup! That's here, but now it starts to get fun.First, the speakers are like high end notebook speakers. You could use this is a bedside music player and be completely happy. It even plays back at an impressive volume, and voice sounds great, even from the next room. If you've got to have higher quality sound though, there is a headphone jack. A set of PC speakers with a sub work out great.Second, it's surprisingly promiscuous. I was able to play very high bitrate AAC files (deprotected iTunes music files) without a problem. Amazon MP3 files played as well, as did 320kbps and non-standard 360kbps. Sound production is very true, and even with the AC adapter, there's no hum. Apart from an occasional stutter when using menu functions, this device is just fine for audiophiles.Something that's unusual for Windows CE devices is that this isn't very \"\"modal.\"\" After starting a music file playing, you can go on to look at pictures or use the other features without interrupting playback. Normally, these devices halt the music if you go to do anything else at all.I mentioned that the device will suit Mac and Linux users just fine. First, the included software runs just fine inside of Parallels. You can stream music to the device and load up its internal memory with pictures and more. But the software isn't needed at all. You can drop files directly onto a memory card or USB stick, organize them in directories, and the device recognizes them without a hitch. I reverted my Parallels image, and I'll go on using this directly.The device also recognizes standard Windows-style media servers. So if you have a device like a NetGear ReadyNAS, or if you want to install the appropriate Mac or Linux open source projects, the IT7150 recognizes those just fine.Just as the device is promiscuous with audio formats, it handles many picture formats as well. I put a few VERY high resolution PNG, JPG, and even GIF files on the device. I tested monochrome, gray scale, and color. It quickly displayed each of these without any problems. Often these devices fall down if you're using anything other than full 24-bit JPEG. In addition, it can display pictures from a handful of different online photo management services. It would be simple to set this up for a Picasa feed, and to then pass it off to a relative or family member who may not be so net savvy. They would see your gallery as you update it remotely.Surprisingly, the device an also play back video... sort of. Once again, it handles a variety of formats. DivX, Xvid, and even MPEG-4 with and without B-frames. This means you can play back the most common downloadable movie formats encoded for desktop, iPod, or PSP and play them on the device.  The playback is fairly jittery on high bitrate or high resolution video, however. At least the audio doesn't stutter.There aren't any guidelines given for video formats, but I found that MPEG-4 360x200 800kbit with no B-frames gave pleasant playback. I used the freely downloadable Handbrake DVD-encoding software and experimented a bit, then saved my configuration for future rips. I was tempted to knock the review down a star because of the jittery playback issue, then remembered... this is billed as a picture frame. That I suddenly have a bedside TV is a throw-in. :)Supplementing the video and audio playback, this device includes a subscription to a service that provides a huge library of internet audio and video streams. The music choices are as diverse as what one finds on Shoutcast, and the streaming video choices are just as comprehensive.Some other features worth mention are the built-in RSS reader and good network security. The RSS reader doesn't provide full HTML parsing - it's a plaintext display. However, it detects and properly shows attachments. You can use this to subscribe to audio and video podcasts - and speech podcasts are a pretty great feature for a bedside device. It's like going to sleep with talk radio, but without the commercials.For network security, it supports WSA and WSA2, in addition to legacy WEP. This means that, for once, you've got a picture frame device that doesn't require you to downgrade to easily crackable network security. This worked just fine with both my Apple Airport Extreme, and my Netgear WNDR3300. Signal strength was super, even when I went outside my condo, down three floors and about 150 feet from the building. That's about as far as my iPhone or Macbook can receive a solid signal on 802.11g.All in all, as a picture frame class device, I'm really happy. If it had been called a general media device, I would have wanted a bit more speed and polish.PROS:Simple and unintimidating interfaceGreat screen and speakersDoesn't require extra software (though it helps)Usable with Mac and LinuxFeatures like RSS media capture movie playback unexpectedSupports far, far more file formats than similar devicesSupports a wealth of card and USB storage formatsTons of managed choices for audio and video streamingCONS:Interface is clear but lacks polishSluggish when first starting mediaNetwork and clock setup are tediousNo web browser (most don't have this but come on guys - it's 2009!)Battery life is a little short - claim is 1.5hrs, I get 2hrs, but wanted more\"", "\"I was drawn to this product because I love new ways to use tech, and enjoy new things. This is a good one!I admit, when I saw this, I thought it was just a extra cool version of a frame-- it is, but it is ALSO something I use every day.I love the easy to navigate screens- the news feeds are a HUGE issue for me,and the net radio works like a charm, right out of the box! This would be GREAT for those in finance, or media.The video is not perfect , but this is to be expected. Far better than what I currently *enjoy* on my year old cell phone, for example.The Wi-Fi connection took maybe 3 minutes to set up, and there was a swift firmware upgrade within seconds.In less then 15 minutes I was watching video,and reading/hearing news from around the world, and seeing my own pictures in a vibrant display - this is EASY to set up.I tried several versions of SD, Memory Stick and a CF cards - everything worked.  Quickly, I might add.  Display was vivid, and the colors were perfect. You can adjust them, but I have yet to see the need.There is a  slight lag time for the touch screen (think of when you use an ATM), compared to an Apple iPhone, iTouch or perhaps are playing a video poker machine.You will get the feel for it in just seconds, trust me.I am impressed with the sleek design - no logo on the case , just form and function - very VERY high end. I have mine on a glass top desk,and due to it being wireless, it is a welcome addition.The box it comes in is very attractive as well- think iPod, Flip Mino HD. Care was taken there as well, making this ideal as a gift.At first glance it might seem like a pricy photo frame, but considering all it can do (to be basic, it is a Windows CE device) I think it is like the Corvette of photo frames!A case can be made that a netbook can do more -- but that should not be the issue here - The inTouch unit is for the home or office and staying there, with a high degree of \"\"dazzle\"\" factor.When people see this, they are attracted to it,and want to touch it.Without question one of the top 5 unique products of the year!Were it to be possible, I would give it a 4.8 -and the minor deduction is for the cosmetic piano black which can attract a fingerprint or two- just invest in a cloth to keep everything looking perfect!Bottom line: The ease of use, Windows CE functions,and wireless, coupled with a sensational design make this a winner. This unit would be at home on any Star Trek set! (and it works,and is NOT a prop!).\"", "I've had this for nearly 3 weeks now and I'm still having fun learning all it's capable of doing.I had no problems connecting to my home network with it, it took less than 5 minutes to do it.The display image is very sharp, everything looks crystal clear on it.Noteworthy perks for me were it's overall high quality, it supports RSS feeds, has good speakers, many input options, lightweight and portable.The only thing that could use improvement is the touch screen isn't that sensitive so sometimes I'll have to tap repeatedly.I would highly recommend this.  If someone is looking for just a digital picture frame they are going to be beyond satisfied with all this is capable of doing.", "So being the new daughter-in-law is tough.  Our most recent trip to the in-laws included my having to listen to complaint after complaint about how I never send any photos of the kids.  Now granted I email them lots of pictures - but apparently they can't print them on their own.This wonderful little device may have solved my problems (at least the picture issue).The Intouch wireless internet frame is a nifty little invention, with some basic computer skills under your belt you shouldn't have much trouble making it work.  Basically if you can figure out how to get the pictures OFF of your digital camera and onto your computer, you can manage this device because it's basically the same process in reverse.  Now keep in mind that this is a touch screen - something we rarely use in our house due to the sticky little fingers attached to the previously mentioned kids.  This one seems fairly sturdy and actually survived a month on the kitchen table prior to it's trip to Grandma's.The good:- you can hook this bad boy up to your computer and upload pictures fairly easily (cable included)- Once you have this thing set up to the internet, you can upload new pictures from states away to show grandma the latest and greatest pictures.- There's internet radio and TV involved (don't expect them to replace your TV or computer, but they're neat to have)- It's touch screen so you don't have to worry about fiddling with a keyboard- The pictures look great- Simple to set up and useThe not so good:- There isn't a lot of storage space on here, once you delete all the pictures that come with it (and don't forget the demo video) you can still only hold about 35 high resolution good quality digital pictures at a time.- The web upload only rotates 5 of your new pictures at a time - so you'll have to pull off old ones for grandma to see the new ones- The touch screen, though sturdy, needs some rough tapping - I advise you do setup for anyone with arthritic fingers.  Though they will be able to manage it may be tough on them to double tap the way it wants.- Not really a wall hanger - this needs to be set on a desk or a table somewhere because if you just want to leave it running, you'll need to have it plugged in.- On humid days the touch screen can get quirky on you.- The slideshow sometimes lags, I assume it's when it's pre-loading larger picture files, but in essence some of your pictures will have longer screen time then others.- We had some stuttering on the internet TV and Radio - enough that I wouldn't opt to use them myself.  If you are buying specifically for this feature I would look elsewhere.On the whole, if you are looking for a wireless internet picture frame, this is an excellent product.  If you are buying for the less computer savvy then set it up before handing it off to them.  Also - advise them of the proper cleaning of a touch screen surface.The size is perfect to sit on your desk at work or home, or to put on an end table - it is NOT a center piece of a room.", "This frame delivers excellent picture quality with ample sharpness and good color reproduction and contrast.  The frame certainly isn't alone in that regard, but it's a great place to start.  Loads of connectivity options (most types of memory cards, USB, and WiFi) and a few other features (video, web TV, and internet radio support) round out a nice package.Alas the frame has its quirks, but they truly aren't flaws.  For starters the interface isn't entirely intuitive, but it's more or less consistent, and the touchscreen helps a lot (fingerprints don't show too much).  There is no direct Flickr support, but the Frame Channel offers indirect support, and Picasa Web Albums and Windows Media Player libraries on network PCs are supported out of the box.  These make it easy to not have to mess with the frame to change which images are displayed, and the built in battery allows for easy setup wherever you'd like.  Lastly, you can set the frame up with hours of operation to save power.All in all, it's the best frame I've ever used, and I'm heading to the photo lab less than ever before!", "This is clearly a product that could have been great, but fell short.Nice build, good quality LCD screen, great WIFI feature.As a photo frame that can dynamically grab photos from photo viewing websites, this product is 5 stars!However, if you want to use this for any kind of news reading, or video, it just isn't very good.For news reading, the formatting of the text is just appalling, with many truncated lines, and such. It makes reading news almost impossible. Also, there are silly little mini pictures that accompany each news piece, which is clearly too small to be displayed.Video playback is very choppy. Clearly this product wasn't designed for video playback.Overall, if you are getting this frame for picture viewing, then this is an absolutely great product. But if you are expecting much more than that, you may be disappointed."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02366946078836918, 0.09967400878667831, 0.04022477567195892, 0.0019214319763705134, 0.18373413383960724, 0.039054181426763535, 0.00019011304539162666, 0.11577039957046509, 0.16404375433921814, 0.3094407916069031, 0.0023350263945758343, 0.000913586700335145, 0.011020957492291927, 0.0007469109259545803, 0.007260438520461321]]}
