"], "reviews": ["I love the speed and agility, as it were, of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto brewer. I accept the limitations as a trade-off for convenience. I do not like this flavor.Not every product can be translated into a single-cup device. In this case, the process for making the drink is the same for the other two-capsule drinks (cappuccino, latte machiatto and others). However, the goal here is to create a kind of frothy hot chocolate. It does that as it should. The problem is the taste.A good hot chocolate earns its designation by using good chocolate and good milk. This provided neither. It tastes artificial on every level.At least the coffee products they offer use real coffee. Those resemble more of a better version of a gas station cappuccino. The Chococino resembles hot chocolate made from Count Chocula cereal.--Brockeim", "In terms of taste, this is perfectly acceptable, though one can make milk-based hot chocolate from scratch that tastes much better.However, you are paying for convenience:  it's a lot easier (and faster) to mix this, especially for a group, in the Krups machine than it is to boil milk!", "\"The beverage flowing from Dolce Gusto's Chococino pods is a great cup of hot chocolate. I have not had better \"\"instant\"\" hot chocolate. The flavor is comparable to that coming from some of the more expensive packet-based mixes, but with none of the heating, stirring, clumping, and residue at the bottom of the cup.What I love about the Dolce Gusto that showed itself well with this beverage is the simplicity & cleanliness. Whenever I make myself hot chocolate, I will inevitably drop powder on the counter or spill all over the cup while I'm stirring. Dolce Gusto is simple, clean, and quick.The cost, however, must be considered. The chococino (like the cappucino  and the latte macchiatto) takes two pods: a milk pod and a flavor pod. At Amazon's current pricing, that makes each beverage just more than one dollar apiece. This is worth it for me compared to the cheaper cost of the mixes because we drink hot chocolate so infrequently. Compared to the cost of Starbucks hot chocolate, this is a bargain. But the cost is certainly not negligible if you drink it often.Chococino will likely be the only hot chocolate made in my house from now on.\"", "My son says this is the best cocoa he's ever had, and I have to admit it's dashed yummy.  But, there are also very good cocoas in foil packets in the supermarket which taste this good.  On the whole an electric kettle and some packets of Land O'Lakes cocoa are just as good as the Dolce Gusto system for cocoa drinks.This is better than the Keurig cocoas.One big caveat:  we thought this could be made on the cold setting for luxurious chocolate milk, but it came out watery and disgusting.  After that, I went back and read the leaflet, and it's not meant to be made cold.  Cocoa only!", "This is by far my favorite Dolce Gusto product. The flavor reminds you of typical hot chocolate with a little kick in it..not a straight, sweet hot chocolate...maybe like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate. I liked it. My husband and I almost fought over the last 2 of these in the box! ha ha... I like regular hot chocolate, (even instant too!) but this is a good, slightly different alternative. It is super easy with the machine, too. We will be buying more of these...", "Wow, this is good stuff!  I'm not a tea drinker, and I really didn't know what a chai tea latte was, but I got a new Dolce Gusto brewer and I wanted to try everything available for it.  I just had my first chai tea latte, and it was delicious!  It doesn't taste like tea at all, nor does it taste like coffee or flavored coffee, or flavored milk for that matter.  It's a taste all it's own -- and sweet but not overpowering sweet (I can't stand anything too sugary).  This is going to become a staple in my household.  Even if you're not a tea fan, I'd say give it a try.  I am very pleasantly surprised by it.", "If you like gas station cappuccino, you may like this. Although the Dolce Gusto coffee maker is a great machine, the coffees are all mediocre at best.  This is no exception.", "I was pleasantly surprised that this made a frothy cup of cappuccino, all from a capsule. It wasn't as strong as I had hoped, but if you play around with the amount of water used, you can make it stronger.I gave it four starts because having froth in your cappuccino is a critical component, a key ingredient. And,I've never had such froth without using a steamer for my milk or a hand pumped frother.", "Chococino is a wonderful concoction of hot fluffy, foamy, sweetened milk and rich hot chocolate.  The Dolce Gusto machine really nails this one. It is quick and easy to make and even easier to drink.  For those who enjoy hot chocolate, Chococino is highly recommended."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10358816385269165, 0.12019059807062149, 0.12131209671497345, 0.1095639020204544, 0.1124144122004509, 0.11256367713212967, 0.09355274587869644, 0.109662726521492, 0.1171516701579094]]}
