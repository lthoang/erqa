"], "reviews": ["First of all, all of the sodastream prices are overpriced on Amazon. Visit their Web site for a comparison of what the prices should be. Still, since this ships Prime, if you can't buy it locally, this could be a nice choice.I have only a handful of my favorite flavors and this is one of them. It is actually pretty close to the original, and since it is half the calories of the real thing, I feel comfortable drinking the regular, although I am happy with both. this diet and the regular are both good. I actually add cherry flavoring and make cherry Dr Pete.", "\"We have aSodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kitand picked up a bunch of the flavor syrups to try out.

I guess it has a more-defined vanilla taste.", "Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though. I liked it. it is all i can find. locally i cannot find any cola syrup. but it tastes pretty good to me. i always wait until the price is right then i grab a few. i enjoy drinking it.", "My daughter enjoys orange soda, but being 6 years old, has trouble finishing it. I can make this for her and don't worry if she doesn't finish. I can make the taste stronger or weaker. I would also shop around, you might find it cheaper some place locally.", "I suppose diet cola is just a matter of taste and there are a lot of different opinions out there on cola drinks. For the record, I like both Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke (and also Coke Zero.) but this cola mix tastes just plain awful to me. I ended up dumping most of the bottle out. It only tasted somewhat like cola with kind of a chemical diet soda taste. I would definitely not purchase it again.Update 4-24-14 - A friend suggested that I use less of this when mixing with carbonated water in my SodaStream. When I used half of the suggested amount it tasted decent. I still wouldn't say it tastes great, but it's okay.", "We love our Soda Stream and usually drink the bubbly water plain or make our own syrups (very easy to do), but I purchased the Root Beer flavor on a whim. We poured the recommended amount of syrup into the carbonated water and slurped. It was OK for a split-second, THEN came the after taste - YUCK!!!If you are NOT of the persuasion that Splenda is natural and don't enjoy aftertaste and don't want to acquire a taste for fake sugar, then this product is NOT for you.From now on, I'm not buying anything without reading the label first."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.161098450422287, 0.14214442670345306, 0.1377422958612442, 0.13984724879264832, 0.1515590250492096, 0.14442506432533264, 0.12318350374698639]]}
