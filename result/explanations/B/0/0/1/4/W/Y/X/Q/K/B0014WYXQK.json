"], "reviews": ["I like this Izze apple juice. One, it is an alternative to soda, which I try to stay away from. Two, it is fruit juice with that extra punch of sparkling water, which to me is one healthy dose of carbonated water. I'm not one to (gasp) .....BURP, but this sure triggered that button. The taste is actually higher in carbonated liquid than apple juice.What is handy is the 8 oz size, easy to carry around, easy to finish. With 90 calories, I find it healthier than sodas or other sweeter drinks. But with the refined sugars, and artificial ingredients, I imagine it is not so pure!But for a quick refreshing alternative to soda, for a pick-up drink, light snack, easy on the stomach, this is a nice boost to beverage selections. ....", "\"Pomegranate: My first sip of Izze's Sparkling Pomegranate was not appreciated by my palate very much; I thought it tasted like someone had mixed a wine cooler with beer. I actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content. By the end of the can I liked it, and by the 3rd can I really liked it. It's tangy, fresh, with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design (aesthetics always matter!).With a total of 80 calories per cute little can, this isn't exactly what you'd call a \"\"diet drink,\"\" but I find it to be surprisingly filling, so it makes a great in-between liquid snack, and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet.Overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can. Don't let the first taste fool you. Izze's Pomegranate Fizzy is quite yummy...a very pleasurable acquired taste........................................Grapefruit: Izze's Sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can I have ever tasted. Nothing is even a close 2nd. Tangy and refreshing, its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing. It also contains white grape, apple and orange juice from concentrates, but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit. The Grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can, for those counting calories, but like the Pomegranate, it's very filling, and does well as an \"\"in-between\"\" snack for dieters.This wonderful Izze fizzy is addictive. On a hot day cold Sparkling Grapefruit is a total delight, and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst, not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier. Thank you Izze, your Sparkling Grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house.If you're into \"\"hard likker,\"\" Izze's Grapefruit would make the perfect mixer, for vodka or tequila.\"", "This is my latest beverage obsession ... I love soft drinks, but because I'm pregnant (and because I'm trying to cut down on the amount of sugar I consume overall), I've been trying to limit my Coke addiction. Izze juice -- I tried the blackberry -- is fizzy like pop, and sweet (although not overly sweet), so it satisfies that craving. Bonus: It's got real fruit juice, so you can convince yourself it's a health drink :)Each can has 90 calories -- more than a diet pop, but less than a regular one.", "I've tried two varieties of Izze's natural sparkling juice, including this one.  It's a great drink - refreshing, fresh-tasting and just the right amount of fizz and flavor.  It's best served over ice or as a mixer with alcohol.  I've made great apple/white wine spritzers with it.  I'm a big fan of Jones' Sodas green apple flavor, though it tends to be cloying and far too strong.  This gets the mix just right - plenty of apple flavor, but not too sweet.This product is 70% fruit juice with the bulk of the rest of its content being sparkling water, although there are some vitamins thrown in the mix.  So: no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup.  Unfortunately, the cans contain a scant 8.4 ounces of drink, and at about a buck a pop, they're pretty expensive.  I can't see myself drinking them by themselves, though I would (and will) certainly use them for mixed drinks.  Some mention should be made that some of the profits from sales go to charity, which is a worthy thing.", "\"I recently had the opportunity to try three flavors of Izzy: Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit.APPLE: There's nothing wrong with this drink ... if it weren't labeled \"\"Apple.\"\"  The drink smells of apple, but tastes more like lemon-lime (and not surprisingly, lemon is one of the three juices used for flavoring).  I expect something labeled \"\"apple\"\" to at least remind me of apple when I drink it.  This does not.BLACKBERRY: This flavor is much closer than Apple in flavor approximation.  However, it was also the weakest of the flavors that I tried--that is, it had the least power, and when room temperature, the blackberry hardly came through at all.  Not that I routinely crack a warm beverage!  But even just sitting on the table, waiting for me to finish it, it warms up and loses flavor. Quite tasty when cold, though.GRAPEFRUIT: Oddly, I think this is my favorite of the three.  It tastes like sweet grapefruit--think \"\"grapefruit Jolly Rancher\"\"--and it is the strongest of the three flavors in terms of power.  If I were to buy any Izze on a regular basis,  of these three, this would be the flavor.\"", "\"Izze is a great concept, especially as this is one soda that is actually a little healthier than the usual carbonated beverages. I ordered the Pomegranate and Grapefruit and preferred the latter much more.Pomegranate: I love Pomegranate juices like Pom and other organic alternatives available [...] as it is a very heart healthy drink. However, despite my liking for the tart taste, the Izze pomegranate juice in cans has a slightly bitter after taste and does not taste as good as real pomegranate juice. It may be due to the dilution or just because this pomegranate juice is \"\"adulterated\"\" with more cranberry juice than pomegranate! It does state on the can that it is a mixture of several juices like grape, pineapple, cranberry. However, since the can said pomegranate I was expecting the juice to be primarily pomegranate and I feel slightly cheated if I taste more cranberry. It would be nice to see more information on the can about the proportion of pomegranate juice in this juice mix.Since I found this juice to be a little too bitter, I tried making a \"\"Pom-cosmo-tini\"\", essentially a Cosmopolitan using Izze Pom and it turned out quite delicious. Now I know where the rest of the case is going, time to throw a party!Grapefruit: This one tasted a whole lot better and has none of the bitter after taste of the Pomegranate. It tastes more like real grapefruit although this is also a mix of several juices.In a taste test, I asked my friends to try the Pom and the Grapefruit. Everyone was excited to see the stylishly slim can but no one liked the Pom flavor. In fact one person said it tasted like cough syrup and poured it down the sink. My daughter also rejected the Pomegranate after one sip and finished half the grapefruit can. I was hoping she'd like Izze a bit more so I could give her some to drink at school, I believe the Apple and the Blackberry flavors are sweeter so I'll try those next.\"", "\"It's difficult to write a detailed review on a carbonated soft drink, but there are a few things worthy of mention with the \"\"Izze\"\" range of drinks. The apple (reviewed here) is my particular favorite, it is light, refreshing, tasty without being too sweet and surprisingly versatile, as long as you \"\"think outside the can\"\".A word of mention about HFCS or High Fructose Corn Syrup and the fact that this drink is COMPLETELY FREE of the stuff is also important. A simple web search will tell most anyone about the ongoing connection between HFCS and obesity, even high blood pressure and other health problems, and the fact that it is becoming used more and more in everyday drinks and food products. The main problem being that (unlike glucose) fructose is not easily metabolized in the body, and leads to high amounts being stored as fat. Izze relys on natural juice for it's flavor and taste, and one serving (one 8.4oz can) has 90 Calories, only 1% sodium, and 21g of sugar derived from natural White Grape, Apple and Lemon juice concentrates. In fact each can contains over 70% juice.There has been a trend away from carbonated drinks over the last year or so toward purified and mineral bottle waters, flavored water, and even \"\"protein\"\" water. I assume this is to cut down on high amounts of sugar intake (or artificial sweeteners in diet drinks) especially in children, also dentists have long bemoaned the effects of carbonated drinks on teeth and gum health. I'm not suggesting that Izze is a perfect alternative, but in moderation it can be enjoyed for it's natural ingredients. Another good thing to remember about Izze is versatility - many people enjoy wine, or sparkling wine with a meal, and a lot of people today prefer it without alcohol. Izze can be decanted nicely into wine flutes for a sparkling alternative to other non alcoholic wines (most of which contain a lot of HFCS).It's also a great mixer WITH alcohol, or simply as a long drink in itself over ice.Why the small cans? - well I like to think that it's a reminder that we used to drink soda and other carbonated drinks in 9oz bottles, and only in recent years have we become overly indulgent to 20oz and even higher bottles and serving sizes.Izze is not the cheapest fizzy fruit drink, but it's probably one of the tastiest, and despite the calorie and carb count (for those watching weight) it is a natural alternative to other mainstream products.As if all this was not enough, Izze also partner with Global Education Fund to provide resources for needy children.\"", "This review will be for the Blackberry and Apple flavors of this product.Apple:Several people in my household have tried this flavor and as such there is a wide array of responses to it. One person really like it. Thought it was refreshing, flavorful, and an all around good drink. The opposite end someone thought it was very sour and they didn't like it at all. Me personally, I thought it was okay. For an apple flavor it seemed to taste a lot like a lemon-lime drink versus apple.Blackberry:By and large all of us didn't care nearly as much for this flavor. In fact the person who really liked the Apple flavor thought the Blackberry tasted like a cheap spimonti (sp) wine. I thought this flavor was a little on the tart side and if I am drinking something to be refreshed, tart is not the flavor I would want.I was disappointed in both flavors not tasting like what I expected. For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors. Myself, I didn't care for them but I lean more towards being a picky eater anyway.", "\"I tried the clementine version of the Izze drinks, and like several other reviewers found the nearest comparison to be the classic orange drink Orangina. I think I prefer Izze to Orangina now, though obviously tastes are personal and your opinion may vary. The Izze has a tart finish at the end that makes the taste a little more interesting. I bet it'd be pretty good with vodka or rum (are you allowed to say that in an Amazon review?).I also like the 8.4 ounce cans. That seems to be a good volume for a fast pick-me-up -- not too little like a tiny can of apple juice, or too filling like a giant bottle of soda.Speaking of soda, that's of course what this drink is, so don't expect pulp or, necessarily, a lot of natural flavors. It isn't orange juice, but a sparkling drink. If you are bored with colas, not interested in \"\"energy drinks,\"\" and it's too late in the day for coffee, you might find this worth checking out.\"", "\"This is a rather refreshing take on apple juice.  It has enough tart taste without being bitter or acidic.  I especially like the size.  Perfect size to throw in a lunch box, purse, brief case, tote.  The serving size is just enough as well.  I like the narrow design of the can.  I don't think the \"\"health\"\" aspect is plausible however.\"", "\"I was pretty psyched to be able to try a case of this \"\"sparkling juice\"\" out, since during the summer I drink a fair amount of juice mixed with soda water. Also, I grew up in North Africa, where the clementine grows in abundance, and I was looking forward to revisiting a taste of childhood. On the pro side, the packaging is attractive, the 8.4oz can is a really handy size, and there's no added high fructose corn syrup. On the con side, the much-touted \"\"fortified\"\" aspect consists of 10% of your daily Vitamin C, B6, and Niacin, so great big deal there. Also, the carbonation isn't as strong as I prefer, although I will grant that this is a very subjective personal thing. Straight out of the can, it feels a touch flat to me. Finally, the biggest con of all -- there's no clementine juice in it! When I cracked the first can open and tried it over ice, at the end of the glass I thought, \"\"Hmm, kind of like clementine, but not quite.\"\" Then I looked at the label and saw that 's a blend of white grape, apple, lemon, and orange juice concentrates! Well, nice try Izze...but no cigar. Ultimately, it's something I'll keep around to use as a mixer with vodka, but not that tasty to me on its own. And frankly, I find the labeling of it as \"\"clementine\"\" totally shameless and off-putting.\"", "I wish I had known the cans have such a different taste to them.  I give IZZE to my kids as a special &#34;soda treat&#34; because it's all juice and no chemicals, so I bought the cans in bulk.  Well, the cans definitely taste different.  There is an aftertaste.  I prefer the bottles now, and will wait till they go on sale since they are so much more expensive.", "\"This is a really nice product for those who want to consume healthful things. Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.Far too many \"\"vitamin drinks\"\" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\"", "Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice is a refreshing drink with a tangy Pomegranate flavor that is not overly sweet. With fortification of vitamins, 70% fruit juice and only 80 calories per can, I will use this as a non-caffeine alternative to energy drinks for a quick, but healthier energy jolt. It was my first time tasting Izze, but now I intend to try other flavors too.", "Everyone has their own personal tastes, but to me this is a Wow. Why so? First I love the taste. It reminds me of the days when I was young drinking Boones Farm Apple wine on a Friday night. Some may prefer, or liken it to champagne.I'm on a diet, lost the first 10 pounds in 12 days. It is a simple diet, eat as much natural fruit, and vegetables, and salads as I want, and limit my sandwiches at lunch to whole grain bread with lean meats, like chicken, fish, or Boka/Morning Star (soy) burgers, and the same type of meat entree at night for dinner on top of a pile of steamed veggies, and Olive Oil. Yeah lots of olive oil. (Not to excess though) My sandwiches, and dinner's meats/steamed veggies always enjoy piles of saut&eacute;ed onions, bell pepper, etc. to put on top of them. You could say that it is not a fast, but rather a feast. One of the key ingredients is I have all the fruit I want. At night time if I get hungry, I will eat a whole small jar of natural apple sauce. No sugar added. Oh, and I drink plenty of water. Eight glasses a day? Probably, I don't measure; I just walk around with a large plastic mug, filled with water, and sip all day long.So what does all of this have to do with the IZZE sparkling apple? Namely this. It is a special treat.I would not call it diet food, because in order for fruit to be dietetic, it must be in its natural state. It can be cut into chunks, and fresh frozen, and blended into smoothies, which is my preferred method; eliminates spoilage, and adds to the fun. But you have to avoid concentrating it, thereby increasing the sugar content. In this case, it is from concentrate, but then they add sparkling water. So it is kind of teetering on the fence. That is why I call it a special treat.So for those who may not agree with my dieting methods, or the fact that I easily drop 20 pounds in the spring, and have been doing it for well over 25 years, (Yes I have lost over 500 pounds in my lifetime) and are more interested in having a good time, let's talk about the Wow factor.This stuff tastes great. I quit drinking some 10 years ago, but this is an opportunity to live it up. Whenever I open a can of Izze, it is like a celebration. By the way, I am talking about the apple, and am curious about the other flavors as well. One thing is certain, I will be purchaing more of this when my current case runs out.When dieting, the big enemy is cane sugar, which is fattening. Fruit sugar in its natural state is immediately absorbed by the body, and does not convert to fat readily the way cane sugar does. (All I know is when I eat cane sugar I immediately gain weight, and when I eat all the fruit I want, I lose it)If you are looking to break the canned soda habit, Izze is the way to go. Canned soda has some ungodly amount of cane sugar in it.Another interesting factoid, according to Dr Weil M.D., the nutritional, and natural healing guru, the main benefit from drinking wine is not in the alcohol, but in the grapes. By getting Izze apple, the primary ingredient is grape juice, then apple, etc. So help your heart, or arteries, or whatever they espouse about the benefits of drinking wine, and get some Izze. I'm sold. Once you taste it, many will be too.I think the Izze people are really on to something here. Highly recommended.", "Don't grab this thinking it's just regular apple juice. This is juice with a definite kick. It's not bad, but it can be strong if you're expecting plain juice. Made with sparkling water, it's kind of like Perrier with strong apple overtones (think a Jolly Rancher). It's a great alternative to soft drinks because there are very few calories in each. The small size is perfect for a quick sip of something when thirst hits. Starbucks sells a number of these, so you know it's going to be good.", "\"This artisan soda - sparkling water is a delicious if expensive indulgence.  It has a tart refreshing taste, and comes in smaller 8.4 FL OZ cans (248 mL).It doesn't claim to be 'organic' but 'natural' and sports the following ingredients:  \"\"pure juice made from white grape, apple, blackberry, lemon and raspberry juice concentrates, sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate (color), ascorbic acid (vit. C), niacin amide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vit. B6)\"\"Calories per serving are 90 total carbs = 21gThat all being said, the taste is superb!\"", "\"I am not a fan of the fruit-flavored sparkling waters sold by so many soda and water bottlers. If you are going to carbonate a beverage, why not really carbonate it instead of the halfway carbonation of sparkling water? Izze has the light \"\"fizz\"\" of those sparkling waters, but the flavor is much better because it is 70% juice.Overall, I enjoyed the taste. I keep a supply in the refrigerator and, although I do not drink it every day, I find that it is a nice change from water or soda. The 8.4 oz. cans are just right, and they chill quickly. As others have pointed out, the flavor is much better cold than at room temperature.So would I buy it again? Maybe. My husband and I both thought it was \"\"OK.\"\" We liked drinking it, but would not go out of our way to buy more. And we do not feel any sense of urgency to try other flavors.If you are looking for a somewhat healthier soda replacement, Izze may be a good choice. For juice, I will stick to plain, old-fashioned juice.\"", "When I first saw the name of this beverage I thought maybe they had hired Snoop Dogg as their spokesperson or to do their jingle.  I guess not.I have tried the Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice in the apple flavor.  The most attractive aspect of this beverage is it is made with real fruit juice and sparkling water so that gives it an advantage over other fruit flavored carbonated beverages, most of which are artificially flavored.  Plus it has no refined sugar or other artificial ingredients so it's a healthier carbonated beverage than most.For those of you who could give a whit about healthy soda-like beverages, like me, the taste is also very nice.  It has a strong but not overpowering apple flavor with the refreshing nature of a carbonated beverage.  It is definitely best served cold.  Warm it has a rather flat, less tasty nature.Overall, I definitely recommend it.", "We did a taste test at home and it was a hit. I really enjoyed it over ice - refreshing, healthy and great for the summer.", "... then you will love this product.*this review is for the Apple flavored Izze*The concept is great and I am all on board with the fact that this product has no additives and it's simply just juice and sparkling water.  Woo Hoo.Unfortunately, instead of using just apple juice, they threw in a little white grape juice and some lemon juice and the result is that flavor you get when you eat apple flavored Jolly Ranchers, chew apple gum, or any other kind of apple candy; that fake apple taste that to me is nothing like the taste of real apples.  I happen to despise that flavor.I still like the product and while my son loved the flavor, I found it only tolerable.  But on those special occasions when he is allowed a pop, I much rather give him this sparkling juice that he THINKS is a pop.And for me, I am not a big pop OR juice drinker, but I love fizzy waters, and this is a nice change of pace.  I would buy this product and flavor, again,for my son, and purchase another flavor for me.My son says it is worth 5 stars because he loved it.  I think it is worth 3 stars because of the flavor, so I am compromising with a 4. :)Cherise Everhard, April 2008", "First I have to admit that I don't drink juice very often outside of breakfast or the occasional glass of apple juice etc at other times of day. I also don't drink very many soft drinks anymore and try to avoid high fructose corn syrup.Anyway, I wasn't sure what to expect what I tried this Izze drink. I had hoped for a stronger Blackberry taste, but find the different fruits blend  together well for a slightly sweet taste that would be good to drink inbetween meals or maybe with lunch.", "In a nutshell this is a refreshing drink. It is sparkling and has pomegranate juice in it. It is a bit tart in a good, thirst quenching kind of way.Not only do I like it, but my seven year old child loves it too.I prefer to chill it and to pour it into a glass before serving.", "Here is a drink that I will definitely buy again.  I generally do not drink sodas and my drink of choice is generally water or green tea, but the idea of a natural juice drink with sparkling water peaked my interest.  The can is 8.4 fluid oz. and is 70% pure juice and sparkling water, fortified with vitamins. The juice contains no caffeine, no preservatives and no refined sugars and supplies 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 & Niacin.  Very low in sodium at 1% and sugars, for those who watch that is 21g.As a weight watcher I rarely will spend a lot of calories on drinks but at 90 calories for the can, I feel like I can treat myself to something refreshing and different.  I liked the flavor a lot because it was not sweet like a sparkling cider, it was more crisp, like a green apple (think jolly rancher apple).  I would definitely purchase this flavor again and would love to try some of the other flavors available.", "\"We have been drinking various forms of flavored carbonated natural drinks for many years. From Knudsens to After the Fall, to Flavored Vitamin Waters without the carbonation, my family has tried all kinds of different flavors and types of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks with no refined sugars added.IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is made of 70% fruit juice with added vitamins such as B6, Beta Carotene, Niacinimide, and vitamin C.  I am not sure what the *natural flavors* added are, as this is often a hiding place for ingredients with some companies that do not want you to know little things they sneak in.Flavorwise, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is very good.  It is made from concentrate so there is not the fresh flavor that you would get from fresh juice, but I find that this juice only has a tiny bit of bitter edge to it- nothing like most orange flavored juice beverages we have had.What impresses us about this is that it is not overly syrupy like some juices are.  It takes very light, yet filling.Another feature of this drink is that the bubbles are not heavy and the carbonation is not overly strong.  Sometimes drinks have so much carbonation in them that they are annoying.  This one has light to medium carbonation in it.One additional thing I like about this is that the cans are relatively small (8.4oz/248ml).  I have never liked the huge can sizes because I feel that you should only drink small amounts of cooked juice products at a time anyway.There are 24 in the case, which is a good number.  We drank this warm without ice, but chilled it is also delicious.  It tends to go down a bit easier when it is chilled.With ice, it is an even lighter drink and bit more refreshing as the ice dilutes it leaving just a hint of orange flavor.All in all, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is a hit in our house.  Great flavor, just enough in a can for a snack, and all without added refined sugars or caffeine! My daughter keeps saying- \"\"Mom, I just LOVE this stuff.\"\"\"", "\"In a \"\"Supersize Me\"\" world Izze should be applauded for bucking the trend and marketing an 8 oz. drink product, which is a much more sensible size than the quart size or larger products crowding the shelves. I gave a can of this drink to a friend of mine who commented that they enjoyed the sparkling water mixed with the juice. On the other hand, I prefer a sweeter orange juice. This, to me, had a dull taste that reminded me of eating a frost burned orange.I thought the grapefruit juice was very tasty. It is on the sweet side and reminded most of Ruby Red grapefruit. I think if I was at home mixing this juice from concentrate instead of buying the concentrate premixed in a can, I would use less water.\"", "The Blackberry Juice is a tasty sparkling juice drink.  I like it and my daughter likes it.  It has a bit of a bitter after taste though.  Because it has no artifical stuff in it we can feel good about drinking this. The grapefruit juice is excellent--no after taste or bitterness at all.  The size of the can is just right for one serving.", "\"My husband, who is not too fond of orange soda in general, tried the Clementine soda with me. I liked it right away, but he had to drink almost a whole can before he said it started to grow on him. He put a little soy milk in it and said that tasted really good, like an Orange Julius.I was glad to see so many natural ingredients - no artificial colours or flavours - although I can't seem to find out exactly what the \"\"ester of rosin\"\" is. That concerns me a tad. I was also glad to find that \"\"sugar-free\"\" did NOT mean that it had aspartame or saccharin in it.I did find it very comparable to Hansen's sodas, which I also really enjoy. I sampled some of the Izze chilled as well as at room temperature. It is good both ways, but has MUCH less of the acidic, generic orange soda taste when at room temperature.We did find it had a very strong grapefruity flavour, which we think might come from the white grape juice that heads the list of fruit juices (orange is the fourth - !)I enjoyed it and would recommend people to try it, although I'm not really planning to make a habit of buying it all the time either.\"", "These drinks are pretty tasty a bit on the tart side but not too sweet which is nice in the current market of way to sweet beverages. I'll be trying more of the flavors fo these drinks. They also make good mixing drinks for vodka and other stronger drink!", "I ordered the grapefruit flavor expecting something akin to Fresca and was pleasantly surprised by the actual grapefruit flavor. While not as harsh as grapefruit juice there is the unmistakable fruit flavor with an added sparkle of carbonation.I find the flavor refreshing and a perfect touch for a hot day. I have also found that it makes for an excellent sparkling Greyhound if you add a little vodka.P-)", "\"While I wouldn't classify this drink as \"\"health food,\"\" it is an excellent alternative to soda for both kids and adults.  You won't find high fructose corn syrup here, but you will find real fruit juices, lightly carbonated and delicious.  My children love it and the 8 ounce cans are perfect for sack lunches.  It's not cheap, but if you buy it by the case the cost is reasonable.\"", "I like that the soda is made from fruit juice but it is misleading in that it is not all pomegranate, it also has apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and the last on the list is pomegranate. If you like a sweet soda you probably won't like this since it is very tart, I was surprised at how tart this was. It has a good fizz to it and is 80 calories per can, the cans are only 8.4 oz so it is smaller than other types but is refreshing. I would recommend this soda since it is a healthy alternative to other types of soda."], "Gamma": [0.17116965353488922, 0.16971467435359955, 0.1488870084285736, 0.16322369873523712, 0.1649886965751648, 0.1820163130760193], "Beta": [[0.03268314152956009, 0.031123394146561623, 0.030922383069992065, 0.0325930193066597, 0.030880725011229515, 0.029865289106965065, 0.03318236023187637, 0.033249955624341965, 0.029227035120129585, 0.031149718910455704, 0.028796061873435974, 0.03267359733581543, 0.036035485565662384, 0.03234821557998657, 0.031428176909685135, 0.031135816127061844, 0.027997927740216255, 0.027239743620157242, 0.03269175812602043, 0.03420865163207054, 0.030809834599494934, 0.03102409839630127, 0.03149072453379631, 0.03245098143815994, 0.024251742288470268, 0.030722834169864655, 0.0349956676363945, 0.026569288223981857, 0.03327769413590431, 0.028969934210181236, 0.03689316660165787, 0.029111573472619057], [0.03302833437919617, 0.031037088483572006, 0.03089233674108982, 0.03273089602589607, 0.0307902991771698, 0.029677189886569977, 0.03348790854215622, 0.03335598111152649, 0.028824344277381897, 0.03125195950269699, 0.02878529392182827, 0.03309814631938934, 0.03625555336475372, 0.032430797815322876, 0.03131118416786194, 0.031047631055116653, 0.02710517682135105, 0.026738177984952927, 0.03314441815018654, 0.034823041409254074, 0.030780456960201263, 0.0309879332780838, 0.031470704823732376, 0.03273018077015877, 0.022506654262542725, 0.03063061274588108, 0.03554076701402664, 0.02647322602570057, 0.0336918979883194, 0.028742829337716103, 0.03770991414785385, 0.028919106349349022], [0.03269517421722412, 0.03103906288743019, 0.03081771545112133, 0.031919460743665695, 0.03083970956504345, 0.03033856302499771, 0.03269342705607414, 0.03465608134865761, 0.02894756570458412, 0.03127975016832352, 0.030808934941887856, 0.03251828998327255, 0.03355696052312851, 0.03197185695171356, 0.031162232160568237, 0.03127095475792885, 0.02675192803144455, 0.027178943157196045, 0.033193111419677734, 0.03406556695699692, 0.030852075666189194, 0.031224265694618225, 0.031303733587265015, 0.03230452165007591, 0.022249216213822365, 0.03105243854224682, 0.0341932438313961, 0.031246595084667206, 0.03348291665315628, 0.029346121475100517, 0.03563641756772995, 0.02940318174660206], [0.033482663333415985, 0.031090490520000458, 0.0306082796305418, 0.032637521624565125, 0.03073621354997158, 0.029704052954912186, 0.03392386436462402, 0.03375770524144173, 0.028268860653042793, 0.031410980969667435, 0.028997065499424934, 0.0331672765314579, 0.03627639636397362, 0.03248794749379158, 0.03144668787717819, 0.031132709234952927, 0.025573382154107094, 0.025723299011588097, 0.033668551594018936, 0.03558385372161865, 0.030819833278656006, 0.031151559203863144, 0.031621940433979034, 0.03296291083097458, 0.020057348534464836, 0.030660035088658333, 0.0358424186706543, 0.027269812300801277, 0.03432909771800041, 0.028432654216885567, 0.03848896920681, 0.02868557535111904], [0.033533960580825806, 0.031005708500742912, 0.030455918982625008, 0.032648228108882904, 0.030689412727952003, 0.02958710491657257, 0.03407647833228111, 0.03423823416233063, 0.028095977380871773, 0.03143278509378433, 0.02889566868543625, 0.03315186873078346, 0.036619752645492554, 0.03255496546626091, 0.03144434466958046, 0.03104444406926632, 0.02573992870748043, 0.025300169363617897, 0.0336853452026844, 0.035721369087696075, 0.03080269694328308, 0.031037522479891777, 0.03161878138780594, 0.03300994634628296, 0.020236888900399208, 0.03048636205494404, 0.03593302518129349, 0.026887547224760056, 0.03438291698694229, 0.0282476507127285, 0.038866061717271805, 0.028568945825099945], [0.03306913748383522, 0.03085135854780674, 0.030891066417098045, 0.033113233745098114, 0.030686067417263985, 0.029228202998638153, 0.03376515954732895, 0.0335606150329113, 0.02868713065981865, 0.031163226813077927, 0.027947911992669106, 0.033447932451963425, 0.03762681782245636, 0.03262202441692352, 0.031170954927802086, 0.030753564089536667, 0.02788994461297989, 0.02645297721028328, 0.03304339945316315, 0.035035960376262665, 0.03064548783004284, 0.03065783903002739, 0.031362034380435944, 0.032859012484550476, 0.02349865809082985, 0.030221465975046158, 0.03620058670639992, 0.02413899265229702, 0.03365950286388397, 0.028367605060338974, 0.03874821960926056, 0.02863387204706669]]}
