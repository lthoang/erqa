I'm all for challenging games, but this one is about as enjoyable as the looping sound of a car alarm blaring in your ear. As for the game mechanics, they're somewhat cool... if this game came out seven years ago. On top of all this, the cut scenes look like those cheesy Esurance commercials, but at least the commercials are mildly funny and drawn a hell of a lot better. Do yourself a favor if you're thinking about buying this game - download the demo first. After that, if you're still thinking about buying or renting it, go climb up on top of your roof, look for a hard surface to land on, and jump off. Now imagine what that would feel like doing 100 times in a row - you've just captured the essence of what it feels like to play Mirror's Edge!", "Don't be fooled by the relatively low sale price. Mirror's Edge is one of the better PS3 games - my view, of course. Definitely worth trying at least as a rental if not an outright buy.There was a time when I thought a first person platformer could not be done. If you have ever had the same thought and wish you were proved wrong, then Mirrors Edge is for you. You play as a messenger girl named Faith trying to do your job in an oppressed city. The only way for a secret messenger to travel  is by running at the top of the city which is rarely monitored.  It's intense in a way few other games deliver.You often feel like you are the main character ducking, jumping, and running across an entire city. The movements allow you a great variety of options in using whatever technique you want in order to get to a goal. Something I personally like is the fact that you can combine platforming techniques in combat. While platforming is immersive, combat can be repetitive as you will be doing much of the same move. It is possible to play the game without killing anyone but that can be frustrating at times because shooting your enemies is the only way to complete an area without spending hours on it.Everything in the game is beautifully detailed from the rooftops you run on to the glove on your hand.  It is strangely easy to integrate yourself into the game's universe and feel like you are the runner in the game. A very nice addition to the game is runnervision which is added to the easy and medium difficulties of the game. This option helps you see which objects to interact with, and really make you feel like a pro.Multiplayer is not that impressive but...  Most of what it is, is trying to beat another's time at running a certain area. I find it very challenging, because most of the time a fraction of a second is the difference between victory, and defeat.Like I said, definitely worthy of a rental but at this (low) price, I'd buy it. We did and there are no regrets.", "Mirror's Edge is one of the more unique games I have played and I will express this in three parts: Gameplay, Story, and Graphics.Gameplay: This game is in the first person, meaning you play through Faith's (the main character) eyes. However this is more prominently a parkour type of game where you must from point A to point B by using your environment. Objects you can interact with turn red, which lets you know where to go. The controls are a bit different from most, (Instead of A/X to jump dependent on which console you use, its the LB/L1 button for example) but a couple of runs through the tutorial should help you get it down. You can disarm enemies and use their weapons, but I advise against using weapons because you have a tiny reticle in the center of your screen and no ammo count display. Disarming and incapacitating enemies is perhaps the only way to get through encounters that I have found because I have not been able to just be able to run away most of the time. Overall, the game is more like a puzzle game of how/where to get where your going and to do so taking as little damage as possible. (4/5)Story: Honestly, this game really lacks here. You play as Faith, a 23 year old Runner (a courier of sorts). Between each mission, you witness a cutscene. These provide a very skeletal structure: Wrong place, wrong time. Framed. Got to clear your name. Bring those who did so to justice. That's it. You don't really get that about much about your environment either unless you read press clippings scrolling up a screen when you're in an elevator, and trust me, that is not often. Either to complement this or to the detriment of it, this game is SHORT. There are nine missions, not counting the prolouge, so you can get through this game in at LEAST 8-10 hours. You could get as much enjoyment from the musical score (which is great but for the purposes of this review, I won't get into). Overall, the story could have used more work. Much more. (2/5)Graphics: If I had to choose the brightest spot for this game, its the graphics. The entire experience is just stunning to look at. The environments are very detailed in your immediate vicinity but not so much the farther out you look. As referenced earlier, when you progress, you must come into contact with objects that turn red, which means to jump or climb to continue. This in my opinion is a nice new way to incorporate the level into gameplay that I had not previously seen. Overall: This is just a lovely game to look at and I expect no less from DICE and EA (You Battlefield buffs know what I'm talking about!). (5/5)In conclusion: This is actually a solid game even if the story isn't all that flushed out. Hopefully the sequel on the NEXT generation of consoles addresses this. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for something unique. (7/10)", "I like the game alot. Me and my lady bought this game because she played the demo and liked it. I watched her play and I liked it as well. We went through and beat the game about 4 time and it was gret. A must have in your collection.", "Mirror's Edge is an unique game, and I like unique games. It's always difficult for publishers to come up with a new idea and make it into a game that works, but with Mirror's Edge, EA / Dice seem to have managed it.The basic premise is simple - you're Faith - a runner. In a city run like a police nation, runners take sensitive packages and deliver them via alternative means. In this case a highly athletic form of street running, or parkour. Each mission is an A to B affair but you have at your disposal the entire urban landscape from the bottoms of the sewers to the tops of the skyscrapers. Run, duck, slide, swing, wall-run, hop, skip and jump your way around obstacles that would, in any other game, be unpassable.The majority of the game takes place well above street level, hopping from building top to building top, balancing on crane arms, and working your way around air conditioning units, pipes, construction materials and the other detritus you'd find on the top of any modern building today.Gameplay.Mirror's Edge is not only unique in it's idea, it's unique in it's presentation because it's a first-person game. You see through Faith's eyes, which means you see hands and feet, and unless you're in front of a mirror, nothing else. This is one of the game's strengths. Trying to use a third-person view just wouldn't work (as it doesn't work in Metal Gear). From a first-person view, you get a proper sense of speed and depth. As you run to slide under a pipe, you'll find yourself ducking in your chair. And if you've got a touch of vertigo, it wouldn't pay you to stand on the edge of a building and look down in Mirror's Edge - the effect is very convincing. The controls are pretty simple - run with the left stick, look with the right stick, and jump and duck. In addition there are basic combat controls to kick and interact with other objects, as well as a slow-motion effect for those hairy moments. You build up the ability to use slow motion by the amount of 'flow' you have. Flow isn't something with an on-screen meter, it's just a natural sense of making progress. If you stop before climbing every wall, and go everywhere at walking pace, you're not really making progress. But wall-run and then jump on to a roof, hop over to an A/C unit then drop off and slide under some pipes - that's a nice, flowing style of getting from A to B. Although when you first pick up the game, you'll be tripping over everything in sight and smacking your head on low-hanging objects all the time.The game does mix it up a little with occasional encounters with 'Blues' - the police. You have some basic slide, jump and kick skills that can be used to attack them or disarm them but it becomes obvious that more time was spent in the control of Faith as a runner than as a fighter, as the sparse fight scenes are awkward to contend with and you'll often find yourself doing them over and over again just to try and get past the police. In some cases, you don't need to engage them though, so hop up on a container, jump over their heads and get away.As well as all the rooftop acrobatics, there are many levels set indoors from the cavernous underground water tank in the first couple of levels (think the underground ice store in the film Total Recall) to the frantic subway chase which has you both dodging oncoming subway trains and riding their roofs whilst dodging rail tunnel infrastructure and jumping from train to train.The game is short - 9 sprawling levels in all plus a training level - but it's exciting and fun to play and you'll find yourself going back and trying to better yourself on the levels you've already done. Having said that, the levels do get incrementally harder as you go through the game, and whilst the run/jump/slide gameplay might seem repetitve, there is always more than one way to get through a level. Crawl through the ductwork, or run through the office itself? Up to you.You can choose to use 'Runner Vision' in the easier game modes which will highlight objects in red as you approach them to hint at the direction you should go and what objects can be used to achieve your goals. For example pipes light up red to indicate you should probably climb them, but as I said above, there are other ways of completing every task.There's also trophies to be earned in Mirror's Edge, which is an added incentive to go back and do better. The tropies are nicely balanced between bronze, silver and gold. For example the easiest trophy is the bronze for just finishing the training level, whilst some of the harder silver ones require strings of moves to be assembled, such as wall-run to jump-tuck to slide.Graphics.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are excellent. The developers have created a unique art style which is mostly white with very pure colours here and there. It sounds dull, but it looks absolutely amazing when you play it. Your point of focus changes depending on whether you're looking at things up close or far away, and when you get up a lick of speed, there are motion blur effects that are added to the scene in a subtle enough fashion to not destroy the look and feel of the game. The usual sun flare and whiteout effects are present if you look the right way, and if you look down the cavernous canyons between the buildings, you can see people going about their daily lives as well as the occasional police cars parked up looking for you. The lighting and texture work is top notch with bump maps and reflections everywhere you'd expect them to be. Shadows are relatively well drawn too. The modelling of the levels is very very good and so far I have not noticed any popup in the game. That is to say, objects change detail or appear so subtly that your eye is never drawn to them. It's also worth pointing out the 'falling to your death' effect. Rather than simply understanding that if you walk off a tall building, you're dead, Mirror's Edge prefers to show you the ride all the way down to the pavement. As you speed up, the screen becomes more and more distorted until it suddenly goes black with a sickening accompanying sound effect. Whilst on your way to becoming a ketchup pancake, you still have full control, so if you really want to, you can pivot in the air and look at the rapidly approaching ground. But I wouldn't recommend it.A final note on the graphics - read the signs on the fences before you jump over them, or at least get used to what they look like. Your first encounter with a high voltage fence will teach you that lesson quickly.Sound.There's a lot of breathing and panting in Mirror's Edge, as you'd expect from a game which is mostly concerned with running like hell. Other than that the environmental sounds are excellent. As you cross the rooftops, the background noise of a normal city is all around, from aircraft and helicopters overhead to the streets below and everything in between. Chain-link fences rattle when you jump over them. Steam vents hiss as you pass them. Bullets zing past and ricochet off walls if you're being shot at. Everything is properly in its place. The subway levels are made all the more nerve wracking by the sound of the train cars, and especially the train horn if you get too close. More than once, the horn took me so much by surprise that I fumbled a move and ended up as a hood ornament.The music is very ambient for the most part. A lilting background accompaniment to your superhuman feats of dexterity. But it does change at the appropriate times. As you're getting close to an encounter with the police, for example, it starts to become a little more menacing, to ramp up the tension. And when you get in to a full-on foot chase over the rooftops and through office buildings, the music changes completely to an excellent run-for-your-life soundtrack, very similar to the style in the cult film Run Lola Run. The music in this mode alone is enough to stop you turning around to see how close behind you the police are.Overall.I wanted to take a star off my rating for this because of the somewhat clumsy fight mechanics. But the more I play the game, the more I can forgive that element of it because everything else works so well. From jumping over wire fences, to sliding down zip lines, to hopping over subway turnstiles and sliding under closing doors. If you're not sure, download the demo from the Playstation Store first - it's free and you'll get a feel for the game dynamics. I like it. 5 stars.", "\"Mirror's Edge is a stunning achievement in visuals and movement.  It's difficult to classify, but suffice it to say it's a great adventure game tinged with shooting and fighting.  The PS3 version supports 720p, and their are times when the graphics look a little bitmapped, but generally the visuals are breathtaking (I'm playing it on a 40\"\" 1080p LCD).  The color scheme is eye popping (lots of primary colors and contrasts).  The camera shake really puts you in Faith's shoes as she's leaping over fences and sliding under pipes.  Surprisingly, the constant shaking of the camera doesn't result in any nausea.  The only gripe I have is that the controls take some getting used to.  It's basically jump and grab with the L1 button, but simetimes the controls feel a little imprecise.  I probably just need more practice as it's something new.  The story is intriguing and keeps you interested.  It's a fairly short game (about 8 hours or so).  It supports trophies, which is nice (I suppose most new PS3 games are doing that now).  At any rate, Mirror's Edge is a nice diversion from the recent onslaught of FPS shooters.\"", "\"Back when I first bought a Playstation 3, I played a game called Assassin's Creed which everyone before its release was hailing as a true next-gen action title. Only when it came out, people found it very repetitive, glitchy and even chore-like where you felt compelled to finish it but not necessarily falling in love with it either. Mirror's Edge is not quite there but it's still one of those titles where the more I want to love, the more the gameplay annoys me, the story is just uninteresting or certain mechanics don't feel well as it should. It's like other games where the \"\"uniqueness\"\" of the whole experience overshadows any faults the game has and while I do feel like I want to play it when it's not on, the more the faults just keep coming.Story: In a totalitarian future, the world isn't dark, grey and dingey Blade Runner-esque but rather it's lifeless, sterile and looks almost boring. With the government controlling information flow and with its own degree of corruption, found along the city's rooftops are \"\"runners\"\", messengers/couriers with vital information and packages that they hand off to other runners. But when runner Faith finds her twin sister accused of a murder she didn't commit and a clue is found at the scene, Faith has to get to the bottom of it all, and running like hell.Graphics: Whatever your thoughts on the game, there's no denying the game does have a sense of style. Largely in whites with the occasional bit of colour, it's definately a feat to have bland look great. The entire game is from Faith's point of view so unlike Gordon Freeman who seemed to float up ladders, Faith's entire body will be seen such as when you drop kick, climb ladders, do rolls and whatnot. It really helps the immersion factor and makes the game stand out on its own visually. What might turn people off is the cutscenes which look like a cross between the cutscenes from \"\"Killer 7\"\" and a more rounded version of \"\"Samurai Jack\"\". While they look fine, the tone of realism and cartoony might seem a bit too disconnected.Sound/Music: The game's anchored by \"\"Still Alive\"\" (no not Glados' song from Portal) and that sets the tone for the rest of the music, a kind of electronical ambience. That is when there's actual music since most of it is actually just the city itself from car horns to engine sounds, the sound and music work quite well. Ditto for the voice acting with roles that aren't really standouts but the line readings aren't cheesy or melodramatic and it's nice to actually see a main character in an FPS do more than say a one-liner now and then (Master Chief, anyone?)Gameplay: The game is a unique FP...um, there is shooting elements but it's more of a first-person platformer with Faith jumping over fences and low obstacles or sliding under them baseball-style with the feet right in front of her, which is perfect for low kicks on enemies. Controls take some getting used to but essentially it's up controls such as jumping or climbing up ledges (L1), down controls such as rolling from long falls or sliding under obstacles (L2), a quick turn-around uses for quick getaways or doing wall-runs to higher places (R1) and R2 which handles your kicking and punching. While it's different than X being jump, square being attack etc, it's remarkably intuitive.But then comes the crux of the game's problems: interacting with the world itself. I will say this: when the game's on, it's ON with Faith doing so much acrobatic manuevers, you'd be hard-pressed not to look back and what you did and go \"\"holy crap, I actually pulled all that off?\"\" However this also comes with more frequent moments of missed jumps, ledges that should've been grabbed but Faith's hands just stay at their sides or trying to do one move only she doesn't seem to want to actually do that move. Yes it's fun when it gets going and I don't mind challenges but most of this game seems like you're trying to work around the game's control flaws rather than you just being a \"\"bad player\"\".Enemy encounters will also be here and one way to deal with them is to, of course run, but on occasions you will have to fight some and pressing square triggers a Reaction time which is basically just bullet-time and helps with nailing the enemies with a drop kick or disarming them. However, sometimes the animation doesn't even register your move even when the gun is ready to be disarmed and making an enemy stagger doesn't allow a disarm either. So instead of getting rid of his gun when he's all winded, I have to wait for him to try to hit me before I can access the \"\"disarming\"\" part? Boo. While there is some gunplay, it's a lot more challenging to not fire a single bullet (and there's even a trophy/achievement for it).One thing I should mention is that yes the game is short, depending on how quick you can get through the levels without constantly hearing your bones break underneath you but it's near 6-9 hours for the 9 chapters but with time trials and ghosts (characters entirely in red doing one route which you try to meet or best), there is a great replay value to shaving seconds off your time but as for the main story, it's not super long but doesn't really wear out its welcome either.If it sounds like I'm being too negative then sorry but I know most people will automatically find this unhelpful and that my gripes are me just being a bad player or that I don't appreciate the \"\"uniqueness\"\" of it all but sometimes, a game with flaws is a game with flaws and Mirror's Edge has em, as much as I want to say it didn't.\"", "Mirror's Edge is a great new take on the FPS market. The parkour twist gives this title challenge and the player a breath of fresh air.", "First, I give this game credit for doing something different. An incredibly new first person experience, running on top of huge skyscrapers.This game is a good blend of athleticism, action, and puzzles.The graphics in mirrors edge are very good:They are sort of a blend of cartoon and photo realistic imagery.The soundtrack is also very cool.The controls take some practice, but they are tight, and need to be to pull off the amazing stunts required in the game.This is the closest thing to feeling like your a stunt-man (woman) in an action movie.", "\"EDIT: January 15, 2011Nearly a year after purchasing the game proper, I have finally, truly grasped just how unique a game this really is. This is to first-person shooters/adventure games what Final Fantasy VII was to RPGs, or Gran Turismo was to racing. It tells a tale that has echoes of \"\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"\", one that most people can relate to - of living in security while giving up one's freedoms, and of ultimately tiring of it all and attempting to undermine it. Mirror's Edge, in a way, touches on the security measures being taken in today's world for the sake of \"\"security\"\" while keeping the thin story personal and relatable. Yes, the plot is thin, but it is told in a clear, concise way that is easy to understand - but more difficult to unravel.There are questions raised that end the game on a massive sequel hook: who is Callaghan and what does he really want for the City? What will become of Faith and her sister? Will the Shard's servers stay down long enough for a rebellion to stir? The questions, as of yet, have no answers, and hopefully, eventually, the game will see the sequel it deserves.Do not be fooled by the naysayers complaining of short length and thin plot: the game's strengths lie in the freedom of the parkour and freerunning disciplines, where the only obstacles are momentum, gravity, and, occasionally, level design. The first time the player clears a gap fifty stories up, or runs across a pair of cranes while being pursued by the city's defense force, or chains together a series of free-flowing, gravity-defying moves to make their way across a wall and over a fence will suddenly clear up any doubts the newcomer may have.\"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" is unlike any game made before or since, a master combination of realistic physics and the sensation of flying that could only be duplicated properly by the game's original developers. A definite perfect ten.------------Upon downloading the demo from the PlayStation Network, I immediately became addicted to Mirror's Edge. The full game is even better: though deceptively short and oftentimes downright aggravating, the beautiful visuals and unique perspective manage to crush such nitpicks the majority of the time.Faith is a Runner, a \"\"courier\"\" of sorts in a police state very similar to 1984's dystopian setting. Though the first mission has her doing what she lives to do - delivering a package - she is then swept up in desperate search to find out why the police are so \"\"trigger happy\"\" lately, and to bail her sister out from being unjustly imprisoned. The result is a fast-paced adventure across some of the most beautiful and glossy architecture ever seen in video games.What is most attractive about this game is its twist on the first-person perspective. Faith's body is visible: her hands and feet regularly pop into frame when jumping, kicking, falling, and especially rolling. For a first-time run through the training level, the effect can give a slight touch of motion sickness. For example, to break a fall and keep momentum, Faith must tuck and roll when she hits the ground. The camera rolls with her and can be disorienting, if not sickening, for the newcomer. Though the effect takes some getting used to, it is a very freeing experience - unconstrained by holding weapons, where the only thing holding you back is momentum and gravity. It's a game where the goal is actually to AVOID combat - picking up a weapon actually tends to take away from the experience - by scaling walls or finding creative ways t sneak around hostiles.Some of the levels can feel a bit long, especially when the player is caught off guard and is forced to make a snap decision, usually resulting in sudden death. Thankfully, for the most part, the checkpoint system is quite generous. Also, there are collectible, known as \"\"bags\"\", hidden throughout the city, making more than one playthrough necessary. Unlocking Hard difficulty (and therefore earning some bragging rights) requires a playthrough on either Easy or Normal, though I highly recommend starting with Easy on the first time through. Removing the targeting reticle also increases the sense of realism, which is already fairly high as it is: everything Faith can do is called \"\"parkour\"\" and is possible to perform in real life.Where the game truly shines, though, is in the Speed Run and Time Trial sections. Speed Running is where the player runs a level already finished in the campaign to attempt to beat the clock. Time Trials are basically checkpoint races where the player's reflexes, agility, and ingenuity will be tested. The free map \"\"Synthesia\"\" is quirky and beautiful, and there are seven maps available on the PSN (for [..]) that feature twelve additional Time Trial races.Though the plot is lacking and the game is short, these are hardly problematic in the grand scheme of things. The biggest problems will be the first time through, such as struggling to find a way to escape from armed cops and having to die numerous times before finally discovering the escape route. I have lost count of how many times I have perished for not hitting a wall just right for a wall run, or having Faith's normally sticky fingers miss a critical leap. Still, the requirement to find multiple routes and get creative makes for a fascinating, if occasionally frustrating, game experience.The visuals are beautifully rendered in primary colors in full 720p HD. Though the character models are a little over-detailed for the generally textureless architecture, and the Flash-animated cutscenes can be jarring, it's often tempting to just stand on a ledge and gaze at the white buildings below. Stairwells, doors, elevators, and pathways are colored in bright primaries such as red, green, blue, and yellow. Object models are very nicely built. Motion capture, as well as facial expressions (in-game engine only), tend to fall a little bit into the \"\"uncanny valley\"\", but otherwise the game suffers little in terms of telling its tale. The music is often exciting and unique with no truly \"\"annoying\"\" tracks. The game's theme alone, \"\"Still Alive\"\", is itself worthy of \"\"single\"\" status.It's a shame the likelihood of a sequel is so low now, as the game obviously works and really could use only a few minor tweaks. Still, as it stands, Mirror's Edge is a great game and a good way to waste some hours.\"", "This game is also made by the Battlefield team, so be assured the controls are spot on. Normally they love to shoot and blow up every thing. This time around; instead of going head on, they want us to run away. You even get trophies for not killing and not for getting shot.  This is coming from DICE :).The game is fast first person platformer. A fresh new adaptation of true and tried platforming. Rather than moving slowly and timing the jump from the edge. Speed is what counts here. You need to be moving at a constant speed to kick open doors, catch a drop wire etc. etc. Every thing is setup for constant nonstop movement. The level designs are so perfect; once you get hang of controls there is no need to stop. The game takes you through roof tops, A/C vents, malls, office walk ways and lots of other varied setups. At every stage there are multiple paths to move forward. There is a lot of freedom and it is tied well with risks.  As with Battlefield risk reward balance is impeccable throughout the game.The character is not a military marksmen. Neither are the enemies. They are just guards patrolling the building. So don't expect a epic gun battles. She is a fast and cute runner, so just run run. Don't waste time in gun battles. Your aim is to reach the check point not clearing the enemies. The game controls are very easy to pick up, yet very satisfying. I liked the time travel mode much more than the main game, mainly for the sense of accomplishment.The game will take easily 10 hours to finish in the first run. I read reviews about 7 hrs, they must be super humans. Some of the latter levels do require you to try a few times. The real challenge comes in finishing the game without shooting any one. The main character can disarm, kick the guards un-conscious. If you really want to shoot them you can do it too. There is no penalties for shooting guards, you can't carry weapons while moving fast.Audio is spot on. The art direction depicts the totalitarian regime. Every thing is cut out from a single template like old communism. It is a nice breath of fresh air. If you are tired of post apocalyptic burnt and brown  backgrounds, join the party. The character models and physics are very impressive. Every thing moves as you expect them to.It may take some time to get a handle on the game. Once you pickup the controls and nail jumps it is very addictive.", "This game is fantastic!!! Original, fast-paced, action packed and FUN!!! I'm not going into story details but I will say that it certainly feels like a really solid action movie.I first saw the game when I was hunting for affordable PS3 titles. The cover and pictures looked interesting (I'm into weird puzzle-like games... ala Noby Noby Boy). Upon further researching, this was PERFECT for me! I played the demo and I was hooked. My brother gave it to me as a gift (also including Red Faction: Guerrilla... which F***in' rocks!) and that was the beginning of great hours of gameplay. The graphics look better on the game than the demo, the sounds/music are ambient and feels just right, controls are excellent, as for replay value... this is where I have to explain. This game is definetly not for everyone. There's no shooting (if you choose to... which is the best choice), you have to THINK like a free-runner in order to get from Point A to Point B, and you have to think FAST!There are several reviews stating the game is short. In escence, it is but I've been playing it in intervals of 1 1/2 hours per day, so the game actually feels alot longer. The game feels like Portal... you know you are closer to the end but getting there is so much fun!! I will definetly replay it on Hard difficulty as soon as I finish it. The game also offers Challenge Mode. This is where the game gets really tough but that just adds to what Faith (the main character) can do. Another point are the cutscenes. They look like E-surance commercials... LOL... but cool enough to get you into the story.Oh yes... if you do not have patience, you will end up throwing the game out the window. You have about 30 seconds to think where, how, and when do you have to act in order to not get killed by a barrage of bullets. This makes the game heartpoundingly fast and exhilarating... and don't worry, you get enough checkpoints to not make you repeat everything again.Overall, I TOTALLY recommend this game... especially if you are into puzzles, first person shooters, and action... and for only $20... what are you waiting for?!?", "This is a game that is different from many.  It goes from rooftop to rooftop w/the ability to choose pacifism hand-to-hand defense or you can pick up a weapon and fight back.  This is all about parkour and has a good amount of fun with it.", "\"Mirror's Edge is a fairly unique game that's all about the gameplay style. You are running, jumping, sliding, and moving towards a goal, no matter what the obstacles.A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you \"\"solve\"\" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.This isn't a long, drawn out epic game that requires 80 hours of in depth juggling of stats and memorizing family trees. You can get through a complete start-to-finish run of the game in about ten hours. So you can learn all the basics in the game in a long weekend of playing - and then replay given levels that you love as you have time. So on one hand you can rent the game to see what it's like. If the gameplay is a style you adore, then you can keep replaying levels to your heart's content.I think it's important to mention two things.First, again, the start-up challenge is there. Some people will have issues making it through the first level or two. The controls are not \"\"natural\"\" for many players to master. Stick with it. Give yourself kudos for trying, and keep at it. It's well worth it.Second, if you get motion sick in games, this game might trigger it. There is a lot of fast movement, deep chasms, and swirling skies. So if you tend to be prone to those issues, you might want to try the game out first to see how well you do with it.So with those things said, this game has an enormous amount of fun to offer. Well recommended!Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.\"", "This game is hard to love and hard to hate.  I loved the unique style of the art in the game. This game employs very cool use of color techniques in the art direction.  This adds to what the player sees while moving through the game, but also is true to how the game insinuated that the character has an almost 6th sense for where to go.  For example, certain paths are highlighted in a way in which the character (you) sees a glowing red door or certain wall paint.  This not only looks cool, but also helps point you in the right direction.  It can also get confusing sometimes, because many things are left ambiguous and the correct path would make a normal human being think twice about jumping over a chasm so large.  Instead, you find yourself falling to your death so many times because you either misjudged a gap or went the wrong way because the correct way seemed obviously ridiculous to attempt.  Towards the end of the game, the art direction really pays off and the feeling of the city finally comes alive when they offer a night scene.  Too bad there wasn't more of this.The music is a mix of ambient techno.  This works and fits the futuristic, police state setting of the game very well and can be often catchy. If you want it to be, you can relax, enjoy the scenery, and explore around until you get bored.  The music picks up and slows down depending on what's happening in the game so it all fits.  The other sounds don't really impress so much.  You are always linked to some guy telling you information and he chimes in while you are trying to pull off delicate maneuvers or he calls you and starts talking while you are actively engaged with enemies or frantically scurrying around to escape. I hate when games do that; have conversations when the characters are getting the stuffing kicked out of them.  Much of the story comes through this way and you end up missing out on what the heck is going on because someone just told you their life story while you were tight-rope walking over rooftops with machinegun wielding killing machines chasing you.I also love the genre of the game: a first-person platformer.  This is a breath of fresh air from the been-there-done-that shooters that saturate the market. It's similar to what would happen if you blended a Prince of Persia-style game with a 1st person shooter, although there is very little shooting to be done on your part.  You are just there to run, jump, and climb around. This is also how the game tends to fail.You will repeatedly die in this game.  Much of this game requires trial and error to get through this.  You will fall to your death countless times or the G-Men that never stop coming after you will either corner you and shoot you down when you get stuck finding your way around, or beat you up when you try to take them out up close.  So many sections require perfect jumps and cat-like dexterity.  The sad part is that the developers of the game seem like they think that falling to your death hundreds of times and staring at a load screen is great fun.  It is not.  Pulling off the cat-like maneuvers isn't as satisfying as it should be. I was anticipating the game's end which is a first in a long time playing games.  It's pretty frustrating.The combat in the game is nothing like what it tries to be.  The game's loading screens display a silhouette of your character disarming and taking these guys out with smooth ninja-like motions.  Unfortunately, each time I ran up to a lone enemy, I would have to simply stand there and wait for his gun to turn red before I could press the correct button to snatch it away.  After that, the game takes over and dispatches the enemy for you.  It sounds simple, but the timing has to be perfect and you have to be standing in the correct position in order to pull it off. It's much easier to run up to a lone guy and mash the L2 button until he falls down.This game has a tendency to seem very lonely.  Sure, you have some guy giving you mission objectives and pieces of story throughout the game and faceless armed killers showing up to gun you down, but you always feel very alone through the whole campaign.  The entire game is an obstacle course, but you never bump into or even see anyone else.  When you crash through a door an some building, you never see office workers jump up in their cubicles to see what's going on or anybody observing you run through any of the games areas.  It would have been nice to include people as another obstacle for you to overcome because it seems to drab otherwise.Overall, this game was fun, but I had trouble getting addicted to it.  Once I beat the story once, I had no real inclination to play through again if it weren't for the time trials and trophies.  Even then, I am tempted to shelf the game in favor of something a little more engaging.  Because of the low price and the unique style offered here, it is definitely worth a look. I would actually love to see what they might do with a sequel and hopefully see more activity from other people walking around in the city.", "\"Mirror's Edge is THE cutting edge of game design.  The gameplay was daring, the setting signature, and the cutscenes not at all boring.  I encourage everyone to play this game for the sheer value of trying something new, and here's why...THE PROS-Stunning gameplay.  You play as Faith, a returning Runner.  Her sister has been framed for a political murder, and you have to investigate.  Faith moves like a phantom over and under obstacles, sliding along ziplines and landing like a cat.-When you get her adrenaline pumping she can slip into \"\"Reaction Time\"\" aka Bullet Time.  This makes disarming your enemies and dodging bullets much easier.  Unlike Bullet Time, such as in Max Payne, Reaction Time only comes available after a series of momentum-oriented activities are completed.-A flipping good challenge!  This is exactly what I was looking for, something new and interesting.  The learning curve isn't too steep either, but the game increases in challenge steadily.  You won't be bored.-Pacifist combat is the way to go.  This game doesn't tempt you like Metal Gear Solid 4 by dumping oodles of weapons in your inventory and then offer you a reward for not killing anyone.  In fact, you don't have an inventory.  The best method in most situations is to dash for your life and seek an out for ever hot pursuit...and trust me there are many.  If shooting people is your thing, you can definitely do that.  Hanging onto weapons is impossible, and you never know how many rounds you are packing..25 rounds max in a machine gun.-I am happy that they implemented Runner Vision into this game.  On the Normal and Easy settings, the proper routes are highlighted in red.  Thankfully EA was intuitive enough to realize how disorienting their game can be and implemented a nice way to track your position.-The first person view makes this game.  On every leap of faith (and they don't call it that for nothing) you will hold your breath and hope you don't plummet to your death.  Success is infinitely rewarding.  As Faith grasps ledges, you see her hands.  When she tumbles you roll with her.  You see her legs and body as though you yourself were rolling.  As your sprints and her biped maneuvers cause you to blink as you question her reality, she feels the pressure and you can hear her tiring.  But Faith never stops.-The intellectual challenge of solving puzzles is also fun.  It is not all sprinting across rooftops and sliding down pipes.  every so often they will toss in a puzzle in which you need to figure out where the heck you need to go.  These also become more challenging as the game progresses, so keep your eyes open.-This is fundamentally an urban ninja first-person simulator.  Everyone was thinking about this the first time they saw it.  Parkour artists, such as Faith, are today's super-athlete modern ninjas who live up to the wall-crawling lore better then true historical ninjas.-The control scheme is quite good.  It places a lot of responsibility on the left hand, all of the personal reaction time functions needed, such as jumping and sliding.  Once you get used to it though, it will make perfect sense.-She's quite the cute acrobat.  Let's be serious.  There are many female gamers that will be pleased to see a woman playing the main role.  Plus, Parkour is predominantly a male sport but is slowly diversifying.  Faith herself represents the growing popularity of Parkour to a wider audience of able bodies, regardless of sex.-Transitioning from games like Fallout 3 and Mercenaries 2 in which technology was the overriding source of information, Mirror's Edge forces gamers to use the most low-tech solution to figuring out one's location, the human eye.  There are no word maps, not GPS.  Just you, Faith, and the rooftops.-It looks good and sounds great.  For those among us who have been spoiled by the gorgeousness of Metal Gear Solid 4, Mirror's Edge (and every other game for that matter) is a downgrade in terms of graphics.  Don't get me wrong though, the visuals are a Pro because they are still beautiful.  Lighting effects and textures look realistic.  It looks as though the designers really took advantage of the Blu-Ray capacity for expansive good looks.  When on the rooftops, the view is stunning...ongoing...surreal.THE CONS-Electronic Arts is one of the most disappointing game production companies as of recent.  EA has so much money and potential, but they have nosedived in terms of editing sloppy gameplay.  They put all of their attention into sports games... and even those can be sloppy...it is hard to screw up The Sims.  Going into this game, I had high expectations, many of which were met.  However, I anticipated that EA would be very sloppy with this production, and they were.  If you played Mercenaries 2, you will understand what I mean by sloppy... unresponsive controls... inaccurate animations...  they could have done much better.-The game oftentimes feels imprecise.  You will experience a series of flawless vaults and slides when the game suddenly does not connect with what you thought you have done perfectly....and then you fall off of a high place and die.  Again, EA was sloppy.  They tried to make this game too linear, but the purpose of Parkour is to roam everywhere, to go places where most average people would get owned, but the Parkour artist succeeds.-To my knowledge this game does not keep a death count, and that is probably a good thing.  You will die a lot, especially on your first try, mainly in gun fights.  I didn't dislike this because it is part of the challenge... one foul-up is game over.  This, however, is not good for causal gamers.  Casual gamers may struggle with this game for that reason.  For those who desire a new and better challenge at every game, a few dozen deaths will not be a problem.Seriously...we all know that sloppy gameplay can negatively affect a game.  EA needs to shape up.  This was their second opportunity to match the likes of MGS4 and Grand Theft Auto 4 in terms of exquisite gameplay and they FAILED.  Please improve...you have the potential and the cash to pull off perfection and we want to see you continue beyond mind boggling concepts and produce mind bogglign gameplay.OVERALL...Mirror's Edge is a fascinating game.  It isn't a masterpiece as it should have been, thanks to EA's lazy editing.  It is definitely worth checking out.  I am pleased with my purchase and will play it in the future.  Simply put, there is nothing like it on the market.  Assassin's Creed doesn't come close.  If you want a truly unique experience, buy or rent this game and play it through at least three times... yeah buy it.  The first time will give you the story and get you acquainted with the controls.  The second run-through will be smooth and enjoyable.  On the third run you'll be kicking some serious booty and disarming SWAT soldiers in pristine style.I'd give this game a 9/10 (unfortunately I can't give 4.5 stars).  Awesome concept, but the execution could have been better.\"", "\"There is no other game out there quite like Mirror's Edge.  While the story may be somewhat routine, the gameplay is anything but.  Set in a dystopian future, you play as Faith.  Faith is a runner, the last bastion of free communication in a society where information sharing is controlled by the government.  Constantly being pursued by the authorities, runners relay messages from one point to another on foot.  And this is what forms the core of Mirror's Edge.  This is a game about running, climbing, and platforming, all in the first person perspective.Let me get this out of the way.  Mirror's Edge has flaws.  The major flaw in the game is the controls.  They don't work the way they should 100% of the time.  Especially later in the game when Faith has to perform some complex stunts, you will very likely find yourself not executing the move correctly, and then dying and having to reload.  Reload times are very fast, and checkpoints are generous, but it can make for a frustrating experience sometimes.  Even if you are pressing the button/analog stick combination the exact way you are supposed to, you won't always be successful.  This is a game that you have to have patience with.  I stuck with it, and although I had some very frustrating moments in the last two levels of the game, I'm glad that I did.  There was more than enough here to keep me going.  But this has to be mentioned and reflected in my review score.  Mirror's Edge is not only a first-of-its-kind game, but it was also an early game in this console generation (released in 2008), so the game's ideas may have been slightly beyond the ability for execution at the time.  Again, I'm not trying to make excuses for the game, but gamers should be aware of these issues.  Also, although it is not necessary to pick up firearms and shoot at the authorities, the option is there, and again, the shooting controls are quite poor.  Shooting is NOT a core element of Mirror's Edge's gameplay, but if you plan on playing this game as a shooter, you should look elsewhere.When Mirror's Edge works (and it does work most of the time), the game can be brilliant.  Running through that frightening, yet strangely beautiful, primary-colored city can be an experience like none other in gaming.  Leaping from rooftop to rooftop, executing a perfect wall jump, or launching a kick to a policeman's face from a zip line;  the things you can do in this game are exhilarating.  Mirror's Edge does things with movement that I've never seen done in a game before, and the game is well worth playing for these moments.  You'll feel the vertigo as Faith leaps from one crane arm to another, with thousands of feet separating the bottoms of her shoes from the streets below.  You'll cringe as she has a rough landing on a rooftop, and you'll tense up as she hangs from a ledge on the side of a skyscraper.  Mirror's Edge is as in-your-face as games get, and as I mentioned, these moments really make the game.Finally, I have to mention this game's soundtrack, which is one of the best of any game from the last 5 years, and plays a huge role in forming this game's atmosphere.  For those of you who are fans of the classic Tom Tykwer film \"\"Run Lola Run\"\", you'll have an even greater appreciation for Mirror's Edge, as this game's soundtrack perfectly suits the fast-paced subject matter, just like that film's soundtrack did.Mirror's Edge may have been ahead of it's time.  It's a game that is bursting with ideas, and it's a game that is truly innovative.  I wanted to love Mirror's Edge, but in the end, it's a game that I like, admire, and shake my head at when I think about what could have been.  If you are a patient, and somewhat skilled gamer that is looking for something unlike you've ever seen before, I heartily recommend the game.  In the meantime, I will eagerly be awaiting Mirror's Edge 2, which is looking very likely to release in the future.  A complete manifestation of Mirror's Edge's ideas into a fully-developed, smoother game will surely be the highlight of whatever year it releases.\"", "\"If I were to review Mirror's Edge (ME) based solely on originality I would give it 5-Stars. Though after finishing the game the hard truths that often follow innovation are all to apparent. ME is a decent game with a new and fresh presentation and even (gasp!) a message. Though a wafer thin combat element and sometimes sloppy controls keep the game from getting a higher rating from me.Mirror's Edge is set in a near utopian future. Crime, poverty and other plagues have been all but eliminated - although with a cost. The freedoms that people enjoyed have been abandoned and a totalitarian big brother has an iron grip on all but a few fringe segments of society. Those that oppose the powers that be communicate through \"\"Runners\"\" - a group of disenfranchised youth that scale skyscrapers and stay off the beaten path. In Mirror's Edge you'll control Faith a runner on the mend who suddenly finds herself fighting to free her sister who was framed for murder. Those familiar with Parkour a.k.a. \"\"the art of moving\"\" will be right at home with ME. For everyone else think of ME as \"\"urban running\"\". Instead of using the streets though, urban runners use the environment around them to find the most efficient path over, under and through the cityscape.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are clean and efficient though sterile. Although you'll spend the majority your time in and urban setting you never really feel it's believable. The developer, DICE, certainly wanted to convey a sense of sterilization and uniformity in the environment. The use of bleach-white in almost every element of the cityscape is evidence of that. Contrast that with limited areas where bright reds, oranges, blues and greens are used. Unfortunately this sterile environment is what you'll be spending your time looking at. Dull rooftops and cinderblock interiors make up the majority of the game.Gameplay is where things are interesting. Think First-Person-Shooter without the emphasis on shooting and instead on running. You'll use L1 for jumping and L2 for ducking/sliding. That coupled with your forward momentum will be 90% of the game - running, jumping and sliding. There are enemies and they are armed. Faith has basic melee combat abilities and can instantly disarm and cripple the \"\"Blues\"\" (police) as they're referred to in the game by carefully timing a button press. You'll also be able to pick up the guns the police drop and use them against your pursuers. Though it's here that ME really stumbles. Clearly the emphasis of the development went to \"\"running\"\" and not to the combat. Though you can melee enemies it's more of a single button mashing affair. Disarming enemies is based on timing and though you're given the ability to slow-down time - call it heightened awareness a.k.a \"\"bullet-time\"\" - disarming enemies is often hit-or-miss. Using guns against enemies is unsatisfying for a few reasons. First the weapons are dull and inaccurate. Secondly, enemies take a ridiculous amount of bullets to kill. If I had to use a phrase to describe the combat in ME it would have to be \"\"tacked-on\"\".The music is thankfully very pleasant and understated and I actually found it a highlight of the game. After you finish the game you'll unlock the ability to listen to the entire tracklist through the extras menu which is a nice bonus.The main story in Mirror's Edge is short - probably 6-8 hours. The game does feature several options to keep playing including speed runs and time trials. Speed runs are all about beating an entire level within a time limit. Time Trails feature parts of levels with checkpoints spread along the way. You can upload your own times and compare against your friends and the rest of the world. Other than that the game features 3 difficulty levels and related trophies for beating the game on different settings.It would take a really terrible game for me to suggest avoiding it altogether and ME is definitely not a terrible game. Still ME is best left a rental than a purchase in my opinion. Good for a run through and for the experience but not something to add to the game library.\"", "This game is like a first person version of Assassin's Creed without the assassinations.  Now that might suck for some people but there is the option to disarm enemies and shoot them with their own gun which you can do in Assassin's Creed also.  Now by no stretch of the imagination are these games identical.Visually AC is extremely superior but the style and platforming makes this game just as good as AC.Graphically this game is not great.  Im not a fan of boxy pixelated textures. Picture the training arena in assassins creed brotherhood that is pretty much the whole game.Gameplay is great.  Dispite the overall look of this game i enjoy playing through it because of the action and platforming.  The chase scenes are so great that you forget sometimes that this is not free roam and sometimes end up diving off the wrong roof to your death.  As chuckle inducing as it is the first time it gets old around death 5 or so.  At this point you wish the platforming wasn't so harsh in some parts but then again it gives you the illusion that your actually a skilled rooftop runner.Replayability is up there.  I know people who say they played it once and never touched it again but i can see myself giving it more than that.  Twice at the very least to see if i can run through the game not using any guns.Controls were funky to me at first.  L1 is the default jump button and L2 is crouch.  That felt funny to me so i switched it to other side and had to switch back because the action button R2 turned into L2 and now that felt even funnier.  Regardless after getting far enough into the game with the setting that you eventually choose you get used to it.Story wasn't nothing special.  Your sister is setup so you have to find the people who set her up and clear her name all while jumping and running away from cops and baddies.  Nothing new here.Overall i found this game to be extremely fun.  Pick it up and play it through its worth it.", "Overall I had a good time with this game. Though short, approx 5 - 7 hours, it was still satisfying.It was a new style of game, like something I hadn't played in years which was nice ecspecially coming from a company like EA.I recommend playing the game on easy. At the higher difficulties the guards can be pretty tough (understatement) and considering the guards are more of an necessary annoyance then an integral part of the gameplay it doesn't take away from the experience playing it on an easier setting.", "This game really is a blast once you get the controls down to an art. The first person view, while often dizzying, really creates striking visuals to any passerby. Fast-paced and breathtaking puzzle-action, only hindered by spotty controls. It's often overly difficult to make certain jumps. And the consistency of the controls isn't 100%. Much of this has to do with the fact that it's first person though; the fact that you aren't always looking at your feet or seeing your hands. At the same time though, it feels amazing when you actually get something done right after trying ten or so times. In no way do I regret buying this game. Highly recommended. There is nothing else like this out there to be found.", "Come to find out, even my virtual-self has no balance. This game is designed to allow the player to navigate through the zones using similar techniques shown in free running videos.  Any wall, surface, or jump point can be used to get from point A to point B.  The game makes it a bit more convenient by marking the items you can use red, but that doesn't make the game easy by any stretch of the imagination (at least not for this gamer).Unlike most first person shooters (FPS), this game is designed to avoid the fight.  Sure you can disable, knockdown, and if needed, even fire at the bad guys, but the main goal is to avoid the fight and get from the start to the finish of any particular puzzle using your wits, your speed, and your uncanny ability to balance (and time jumps).That's where my stability comes in.  If you playthis on the PS3, you balance your character with the PS3 remote, by holding it steady and moving it slightly left/right to keep yourself upright on narrow beams.  That being said - I may need to get checked out, because of all the puzzles in this game, balancing on the beam seems to be my weakness.  Shoot at me?  No problem?  Have me jump 50 feet between buildings w/a tuck and roll thrown in for fun?  No problem?  Have me walk across a 6in wide beam approximately 10-15ft long...holy cow am I in for a world of hurt (and likely a fall or three).Overall, Mirror's Edge redefines what a fun FPS type game can be like.  Not everything is about invincible powers and unlimited ammo.  Sometimes it is about doing what man has been innately programmed to do - flee.  Graphics are nice enough and the storyline is well scripted.  As stated - the red &#34;hint&#34; markers on items you can jump on/off is fairly helpful, but you'll eventually become a pro at picking things to use as you progress, not relying solely on the red markers.  If you can pick this up at a reasonable rate, I'd say go for it.", "\"I'm going to come right out and say it, Mirror's Edge is innovative, yet flawed. The genre of first person platforming is one that has barley been touched at all, especially in an era of games that emphasis shooting like John Woo, and Micheal Bay-esq explosions.Jumping seems like such a foriegn concept to most games today, but ME keeps it fun and simple. For controls, one button is assigned for any upward movement (jumping, climbing, etc) and one button is set for downward movements (slidding, skidding, ducking). The premise is simple: in a world where the 1st Amendment is gone, and news is super censored, one woman (named Faith) must clear her sisters name by finding out who is the infamous cop killer. In Faith's world of corrupt politics and information, you have to find out the truth by city jumping. ME puts you even more in Faith's eyes when you see her arms pumping while sprinting, feet flailing in mid jump, and air rushing by Faith's ears. Small details go a long way into player inclusion.The cities colour palate consistes of a small, but symbolic, set colours. Bright and vivid reds, oranges, whites, blues and greens fill the city up with life. Set pieces are grand and memorable also. Wether you're sprinting through the sewers, empty offices, roofs or elevator shafts, the sets are extremly detailed. You can admire the detail up close while constantly spatter yourself on the wall to. ME focus' on fast paced momentum, but the paths often branch off, giving you one correct path, and 4 wrong ones. ME uses red objectes illustrate the correct path to travel, too bad the red objects only show up when the path is blatently obvious, leaving most of the game to be a frustrated frenzy of trial and error. This becomes an all to common occurance, escpecially once the dead ends result in Faith getting shot, splattering on the pavement, or the player becoming extremly annoyed.Even better yet (sarcasm) is when the seemingly \"\"right path\"\" takes you to an awkward combat encounter. Combat is a simple but tricky disarment. Simple as in one button to flip the bad guys over. Tricky as in getting 1/4 a second to do so. Even in the slo-motion mode, one simple mistake equals death and restarting over. Gun combat is even more harsh. Once you take a gun, it becomes a cumbersome piece of metal that cant hit any target unless up close. Even then, it still takes half a clip to kill someone.ME has good intentions, but I cant help but to think that DICE found a cool concept, and shelved it prematurly. When you know the right path, ME delievers a great experience that I havent see before. If you go slightly off track, or run into a dead end/police, there is no experience as frustrating as ME\"", "\"+ Pros:+ Unique first-person gameplay+ Earnable trophies+ Online competition+ Unlockable content- Cons:- Repetitive levels- Flawed combat system\"\"I knew the fastest route to the exit was already laid out in front of me. As I worked up to my full sprinting speed, I felt my heart pounding faster and faster. I leapt down the staircase and landed with a forward roll, never breaking momentum. I threw my shoulder into the door at the end of the hall, and the lock popped open from the force of my impact. As I escaped, I wondered how people could be afraid of heights. Some see fear, I see challenge. Others see apprehension, I see exhilaration. I'm still alive...\"\"Anyone who saw the movieCasino Royaleremembers the construction site chase sequence - Daniel Craig had to chase down a terrorist who was a master of Parkour: a method of moving from one place to another in the quickest and most efficient ways possible.In Mirror's Edge, you take the role of Faith - a young roof runner proficient in Parkour. Her sister has been accused of a crime she didn't commit, and you have to clear her name while keeping one step ahead of the Blues (police) on your tail. The game is presented in a first-person perspective, designed to fully immerse the player in Faith's world. Whether it's stretching to reach a ledge, going into a landing roll or leaping across a 50-foot gap between buildings, the player does it all. Unlike other games in a first person perspective, Mirror's Edge offers a view of the player's hands, feet, and even the torso to accurately judge distance, depth and height.Though the tutorial lessons, we learn the available maneuvers in the game: running, wall climbing, sprinting, sliding under objects, vaulting, soft landings, and most importantly, how to disarm hostiles. Holding a weapon makes Faith move slower, and since time is of the essence, more often than not we find ourselves discarding weapons instead of using them.The trophy system is well-built for Mirror's Edge. With each level of gameplay and each time trial, trophies are earned. The designers clearly wanted to focus on the running aspects and less on the combat; evidenced by a trophy awarded when the player completes the game without shooting any enemies. Online leader boards record the fastest run-throughs of each level, and the competition is FIERCE.Even with all this going for it, Mirror's Edge does have its flaws. If a player isn't right on target with physical attacks or misses the opportunity to disarm a hostile, they are left open to a crushing counterattack. Some pathways are crystal clear, others are not always visible to the naked eye and will require some trial & error to navigate through. After a time, the levels start feeling repetitious, and with only 9 levels to explore, Faith's frenetic pace makes the game feel quite short.Williams Belle, one of the founders of Parkour, had this to say:\"\"...It should not be lost. It has to stay alive! I do not want to have this experience, and just write it in a book, it would become a dead experience! I want it to be alive! I want people to use it, to live it and to experience it.\"\"Well, Mr. Belle, after playing this game, I can say that Parkour is still alive...and ready to thrive.If you look at a construction zone and see an obstacle course, don't be surprised if you find yourself pulled to the Mirror's Edge.\"", "It's not hard to believe why Mirror's Edge has such loyal fans that demand a sequel; this is one heck of a unique game. While there are several things that could be refined, a game like this is hard to come by. Here's my review:Story: 2/5Not one of the most gripping stories in existence, you play as Faith, a Runner. In a city that's tightly controlled, Runners are couriers that serve to deliver information, maneuvering across buildings and leaping from ledge to ledge. One day, Faith's sister is framed for murder and it's up to you to uncover the truth and set her free. Honestly, though, the finer details were hard for me to grasp, and I never really cared for any of the characters. The plot details just seemed to be convenient ways to explain why you went from area to area.Setting: 5/5Mirror's Edge sets itself apart from other titles with its intriguing art style. The city is 80% white. This probably has as much to do with symbolism as it does with signature style. Regardless, it worked for me. Structures like vents will obviously be black or blue, and the objects you'll interact with are red for ease of navigation. In between levels, cutscenes will feature a look that reminds me of E-Harmony commercials. It's all very stylistic and really makes the game stand out. Most of the time you'll be outdoors on rooftops, but sometimes you'll scramble through warehouses and other interior locations.Gameplay: 3/5Parkour. Lots of it. This game is almost all about agilely moving from one place to the next. Your move set includes actions such as wall-running, sliding, climbing, wall-jumping, rolling, coiling in the air, and of course sprinting. Little things in a video game are as thrilling as pulling off moves in Mirror's Edge smoothly. You'll be getting lots of feelings of accomplishment from this game. There are tidbits where you'll need to engage in combat. Needless to say, these segments are nowhere near as fun. Shooting mechanics are subpar; bullets have no impact on enemies up to the moment you kill them, and you throw away a gun as soon as its clip runs out of ammo. You can perform disarms on enemies at very specific instances, but the timing is just so awkward.  You do, however, have the option of meleeing your opponents, but again, the game falls short of spectacular on this front. Melee consists of a 3-hit combo, a jump kick, and a slide kick. That's it. Did I mention that 90% of your enemies are guys wearing S.W.A.T.-like suits?Missions: 4.5/5-CampaignThe campaign is 9 acts long; you can reasonably finish it in 1 or 2 days. That's not to say it's too short, though. You'll feel like the length is decent for this title. The levels are well designed and moments vary from peaceful to hectic. There's only one thing to do aside from just playing through the game, and that is collecting Runner Bags. These are the game's collectibles, but they're such a letdown. These serve no purposes except for earning a few trophies. I repeat: NO in-game reason to collect these.-Time TrialAn AWESOME mode. Time Trial takes short segments from the main game and require you to get through as quickly as possible. You'll earn Stars for various times, with 1 star being the lowest rating and 3 being the highest. For those that are interested, there are leaderboard spots to compete for. To obtain 3 star ratings, you'll often refer to Youtube videos to see the champs get through. In doing so, you'll learn valuable shortcuts that would have never occurred to you. This is an ingenious way to get players to learn the game inside and out.-Speed RunBasically, these are campaign levels again, except with a time counter. Your object is to finish below the target time. I recommend doing Time Trials first, to learn shortcuts for the full campaign levels. Essentially, Time Trial teaches you to better go through Campaign and Speed Run. It's worth noting that Time Trial and Speed Run demand both skill and patience.Overall: 4/5A very worthwhile experience. The plot is iffy and filled with characters you won't care about in the slightest, and combat is laughably horrendous, but you'll be treated to a one-of-a-kind setting, exhilarating parkour, and addicting game modes that ensure you get the most out of Mirror's Edge."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.011645928025245667, 0.01740032620728016, 0.01060563139617443, 0.13065558671951294, 0.005778744351118803, 0.007496207486838102, 0.05160742253065109, 0.043177731335163116, 0.08730337023735046, 0.005067917052656412, 0.015202282927930355, 0.002041896339505911, 0.09389816224575043, 0.04851417616009712, 0.1354857236146927, 0.08489696681499481, 0.05429079756140709, 0.024883508682250977, 0.02311435528099537, 0.04929736256599426, 0.07738152146339417, 0.0038923651445657015, 0.011556524783372879, 0.0033994840923696756, 0.0014059601817280054]]}
