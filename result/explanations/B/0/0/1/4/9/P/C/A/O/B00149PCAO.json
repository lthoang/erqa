I loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game. I just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the game.This game could've been great. It should've been great. It had so much potential. And it is different. It truly is unlike most games that come out. It has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police, both on foot and in the air via helicopter. The emphasis is on exploration and evasion.Unfortunately this is one reason why combat is so short-changed. On the times when the only options are to fight or die (and there are plenty of them) the combat is extremely difficult. Many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemy.And as I write this I do so after attempting to escape the mall. There is a section which no matter what I do, I die. If I fight the SWAT, I die. If I try to wall run to the pipe I am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section, somewhere in there I die. Either I miss because there is so much gunfire and small, minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make (you'll get shot since Faith, the lead character, can't seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster) If I actually do make the jump and land, it doesn't matter because I become a lead sponge.Another large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop. There are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly, forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying. I was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty. Unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossible.Speaking of repetitive, the game would've been far better if it wasn't so linear. The devs hint at looking for alternative paths. Don't bother looking for them. They don't exist. The game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is. Until then you will see \"\"Loading\"\" many, many times.And it's a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game. Without giving anything away, the subway has one such moment, as does a construction level. There's a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too. Immersion is handled extremely well. For years gamers could never see their hands or feet. In this game they can and the camera never pans out. Ever. If you make a roll, the camera will do a very fast 360, just like in real life. As you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum, and Faith's breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of time.Dice, in the slight chance someone from your company reads this, in the future, don't just test your game for bugs and glitches. Test the game to ensure that it will be fun. Don't give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible, frustrating gameplay. I do understand that you're owned by EA Games, the Walmart of the video game industry but I am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offer.In all honesty Dice, I truly do want to see a sequel to this game. I do want to see this franchise succeed. I want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and I believe that this game is that first step, so I am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step, it will be a good one. I really did not want to write this. I did not start playing Mirrors Edge hoping to find things to criticize. I really wanted to enjoy this game and I am truly saddened that I simply cannot do so. Please make another game that is like this one, only without the needless frustrations. If you do that, and you can find ways to improve on what you did right, and you did do a lot right, then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on Amazon as of the time of this writing.\"", "\"Mirror's Edge is a first person based mostly platformer with some melee and a splash of guns (in your hands, anyway) set in a oddly contrasted \"\"clean\"\" dystopian future.Faith, your character, is a runner -- a person who literally runs across roof tops and through the streets in order to deliver sensitive packages of, well, we never really know.  Apparently whatever is in these packages is important enough for entire legions of law enforcement to spend their time sending copious amounts of lead in your general direction.  Faith spends most of her time, well, to be frank: falling.  And dying.  Repeatedly.  When she isn't plummeting to her death (or even worse, a screen redding fall farther passed your last check point) she is busy shimmying up and down pipes and ladders, springboarding off of boxes and chairs, running on walls, and hanging on ledges.  She is quite busy with these tasks.Faith will traverse areas as mundane as high rise roof tops, complete with zip lines and plank bridges.  She will make her way through sewer drains, malls, office buildings, empty hallways, a cargo ship, empty hallways, more empty hallways, a construction site, some building lobbies, air ducts/vents, and most of all:  she'll spend quite a bit of time in elevators.Faith will also battle a wide variety of enemies.  Most of which can whip her pretty good, especially if there is more than one -- and there is almost always more than one.  So the best tactic Faith has is to run, except when she is forced to fight.  Which is more than she'd like.  Faith will also be forced to fight on several occasions because it, apparently, takes her a while to turn wheels and push elevator buttons -- and lord knows that is dicey behavior while under fire.Mirror's Edge is an unique game in that it tries to implement a platform game in the first person.  This doesn't quite work as well as one might think.  The impression one gets is that Mirror's Edge is about flow.  This is incorrect.  You can flow, briefly, on occasion -- or if you've played a part enough times to memorize it, and, uh, in many occasions, you will -- but mostly the game is a series of restarts littered with plenty of \"\"okay, where do I go now, let me walk over here, no I guess I go the other way, oh wait, maybe I go over here...  maybe over here...\"\" and so on.  I did get some decent flow going once I'd been forced to play the same part about twenty times.Which brings me to my next gripe:  Some parts, whether you like it or not, you will play over and over again.  Sometimes this will be because you can't pull off some delicate timing, sometimes it will be because you can't figure out what to do (or where to go -- the \"\"hint\"\" feature is deceptively useless sometimes) or sometimes it will be because you get unlucky and get peeled like an banana.  The check points, thankfully, aren't too bad -- although there are some where you have to do quite a few moves in a row successfully to reach which can be a trial if you flub the last move.  Over and over again.The graphics are stunning at times, if you set aside the eSurance style cut scenes.  I didn't mind the cut scenes, I just found it a strange choice.  If you have the time, at the moment in the game, to take in your surrounds you will realize that the art is really well done.  It is rather sparse at times but the contrasting of colors makes it very striking.  Other times you'll be running through monochrome hallways to monochrome elevators where you will twiddle your thumbs in tribute to Mass Effect and its load times.The game is very short.  I spent a good portion of time, like some lab animal trying to eat a piece of electrified food, repeating certain specific parts.  Even then, the game consumed less than six hours of play.  I did play it on the normal difficulty -- which mostly affects combat issues -- and it got plenty dicey towards the end.  There is a version of the game you can play, \"\"Speedrun\"\" which is exactly what it sounds like.  There is also time trial and leaderboard stuff, if that appeals to you.  Perhaps people partial to that will be much more replayability out of it.The controls are, mostly, pretty fluid except you do run into odd clunkiness with your character's motions when the game doesn't quite connect your moves together right for some reason.  Your left hand will definitely be far more tense than your right as pretty much everything is done with the left bumper and left trigger.Faith, apparently, has some sort of neck injury which does not allow her to look down while hanging on a ledge, will climbing a ladder, or while shimmying on a pole.  Odd for someone evidently made of rubber.  She also can't seem to look much passed her shoulder when hanging from a ledge -- this requires her to drop an arm and slowly turn away from the wall.  These are minor irritations through out the game, though.All in all, the game was mildly entertaining with sporadic moments of coolness poisoned by a river of frustrating game play.  I feel better off having played the game, but my over all impression is a very mixed bag.  I'm not sure it really justifies a straight up purchase -- and if you are on a limited budget, or are choosey/particular about your games, I would highly advise renting it.  Or talking someone else into buying it just so you can watch their blood pressure rise and their wireless controller soar through the room.\"", "\"I'm a great gamer. I'm a fantastic gamer. I've played video games for many many years. I hate games like this. If you make the slightest mistake you're dead and you have to do it over... and over... and over. I got stuck doing the dumbest things over and over and over again until I got it \"\"just right\"\". It's so annoying. A modern game shouldn't be this particular about jumps and landings. It's like the most annoying game I've played in the last ten years.\"", "\"Mirrors edge is a unique game, with a setup that you'll be hard pressed to find mimiced elsewhere. The story follows Faith, a messenger in a Orwellian touched future, were surveillance is everywhere and the police overwhelmingly an arm of powerful corporations. After nearly being gunned downed while delivering an innocuous message, Faith encounters her sister Kate, who has been framed for the murder of a Mayoral candidate.The mechanisim of Mirrors edge is entirely first person, with stomach dropping leaps and parkur acrobatics carrying Faith from rooftop to rooftop. The voice guiding her is Merc, who at provides more commentary than omniscient directions. The path forward is given an overall tone, and Faith has \"\"runner vision\"\" where ineractive objects glow a blood red color. While the setup is a tad repetitive, its uniqueness grants it a lot of leeway. The backdrops are city skyline de jour, having the appearance of a futuristic skyscape painting. The effect is still real enough that you'll get an adrenaline rush when you fall.The voices are well acted, though rather calm considering the gunfire and the near death falls. The sequences are cel-shaded in the style of XIII, though almost too cartoony.The story shapes up well, though it is rather short, and the gameplay is exciting, and just frustrating enough you'll be compelled to complete levels just for the expereince of doing so. While some of the graphics are somewhat flat, thats a small nit in an otherwise fantastic deviation from the status quo for adventure games.\"", "\"As anyone who's ever been in a job interview or met the guy/girl of your dreams, you'd know how important that initial first impression is and your thoughts upon it can be influenced by that first go. After all, if you act like a buffoon in front of that gorgeous girl from work, imagine the work it would take to correct that. Gaming is similar but with anticipation very heavily found, these first impressions can be somewhat disappointing or the game's so full of awesome that it blows you away immediately. When I first played Mirror's Edge, one of the fall games I was dying to play, I had to say I hated it and glad I didn't buy it. Frustrating trial-and-error, broken combat and rather lame story made me think it was another one of those \"\"good idea, bad execution\"\" type deals. Well after playing it a second time on the 360 this time, certain gripes remain but maybe I was just too harsh last time.Story: You play as Faith, a \"\"runner\"\" who travels along rooftops hopping to wherever there's solid ground transporting vital packages though what's in them is usually never mentioned but apparently they're bad since the government, all-powerful and all-controlling, wants them back. When a mayoral candidate is found dead and Faith's sister Kate is the suspect, it's up to Faith to use her brains as well as her feet and hands to figure out the truth.Graphics: Using the Unreal Engine, what immediately strikes is it has a very distinct sense of style. Sure it's FPS and visible body parts akin to Monolith and the \"\"Condemned\"\" games but with a bright, nearly sterile city, huge draw distances and colored walls, it's quite a vibrant looking game. Even things like framerate were pretty spot-on though occasionally I'll notice a funky texture on some things while other things (stare at a pipe when you're climbing one) look great. Character models look...okay for the most part and the story sequences, while good in their own right, differ too much from the in-game graphics and cutscenes.Sound/Music: Anchored by its theme music \"\"Still Alive\"\" sung by Lisa Miskovsky (and not by gLaDoS), the music is along the lines of a techno soundtrack with a fair bit of ambience, trance music and energetic stuff as well when things get more dicey. It's actually quite a lovely soundtrack to listen to though it's not really \"\"memorable\"\" in terms of melodies, just pleasant. Voice acting I found very well-done and never found problems with anybody in the cast and it's nice to see an FPS character actually say something rather than bland Nathan Hale from Resistance or all-important-but-mute Gordon Freeman.Gameplay: I think everyone and their mother's dog have been getting a bit tired of FPS games and especially the obsession with World War 2. While occasionally you'll have something like Bioshock or Fallout 3 to change things a bit, it's a bit too same-y when you're dealing again with shotguns, grenades and the like so in comes Mirror's Edge and does things differently. The core part of gameplay is getting from point A to B and figuring out how to do that. The controls are like this: LB is your jump while LT is your crouch, RB is your quick turn around and RT is your attack. These are sensitive to the situation so for example a jump and kick will be a different combat maneuver than a sliding kick baseball style. LB will be the dominant button since with it you can jump to places, climb up ledges, swing off of poles and beams and wallrun Prince of Persia style. Also found is using LT to slide under gaps or going more into a ball to clear a fence's top. While I don't normally use 2 fingers for the triggers, it's actually remarkably intuitive and not once did I feel like \"\"okay now...when I jump it's....LT I press, right?\"\"Also included, since it is Dice, maker of the Battlefield series, is combat and guns and sadly they just don't work. Everytime the platforming was around, I loved it despite the occasional missed jump but when you have to fight otherwise you'd just be shot if you ran anyway, then it gets frustrating. You have a disarm move to knock your opponent out and grab their weapon only sometimes it won't actually trigger and you'll just get your face smacked in anyway and of course you're typically being shot at by about 4-6 others so why bother disarming one guy when more are just going to target practice you anyway? Not to mention it's hard to target a guy to drop kick or what have you when you're running like hell so runner vision, another slowmo feature, makes it a bit easier though sometimes you just die in slow motion anyway.The fun parts of the game are easily the platforming and many times when I'm being chased or just gotta get somewhere, it's a blast to hop, roll, slide and wallrun over everything to get there and though it's touted that you can go anywhere you want, it's really just linear though you can climb a small building or scale a nearby fence but it's more shortcuts and speed than alternate routes. Alternatively, it's easy sometimes to wonder where the hell you're supposed to go and many times, I'll be chased and I'm wondering \"\"now what?\"\" as I'm trying to figure out just where the exit is. Maybe it's just the second time going through it but I found it easier to get where I needed to go once I knew where I actually needed to go rather than guesswork.This game kind of reminds me of one of those things where the first time you hated it, found it tedious/boring/unfunny/whatever but then you go \"\"well, maybe it just needs to grow on me\"\" and so Mirror's Edge does have flaws, big flaws that I wish weren't a part of it but on the other hand, there is some entertainment to be had despite its short length but like other games that aren't massive sellers, this'll either be a love it, like it or hate it. I moved from the middle to somewhere on the way to the former.\"", "\"Initially I did not enjoy myself the first time I played this at all.  Mirror's Edge is really a strange bird....it's one of the few (maybe the only) games out there that gets better the more you play and become familiar with it.  Reason being is that it consists of mostly all trial and error game mechanics (which I'm not a fan of to any extent) to become familiar with the levels and eventually proficient enough to proceed the quickest and most efficient way possible, which is the name of the game.  When first playing and being completely unfamiliar with the environment, it can become infuriatingly frustrating trying to find the correct path.  This is not such an issue except when the chase sequences begin, where you need to haul *** and get out of dodge ASAP.  Then it's like being a chicken with your head cut off, running in every direction into walls, off rooftops, wondering where to go all the while being torn up by gunfire.  Admittedly not very fun.  Combine this with the fact that there's no margin for error at all when you ARE on the right path.  Throughout your first few playthroughs you will die a lot, and I mean A LOT.  Count on it.  I've died 15-20 times in a row trying to discover the correct path to success and how to navigate the best possible way.  Luckily the falling death animation is always fairly satisfying with a nice loud crunching sound effect, just like you'd expect to hear from someone hitting the pavement from 30 stories up.  A fairly accurate depiction of death by falling I'd imagine.While I'm at it, I mine as well get the negatives out of the way.  There are a few numerous points throughout that are simply poorly designed and/or executed.  One noteworthy part takes place while trying to escape from the mall, where it's required to swing from a bar onto a platform and jump to the other side.  Thing is, Faith needs to shimmy over to the center of the pole to be able to make the jump, which she seems intent on doing at .00000000001 mph.  Not to mention taking five seconds to start swinging.  All this takes a good 10-15 seconds, with the police filling Faith's behind with lead all the while.  She cannot take much punishment and dies very easily.  It's purely a matter of luck to make it, there's no skill involved whatsoever and I had to restart on easy to be able to get past it after dying for the 40th time.  There are similar parts like this (a train section), but it's by far the worst offender.With all that said, the payoff is well worth it when you've put the time and effort into learning the intricacies of movement and the architectural layouts.  When this game's off its game I've never been so pissed in my entire life.  It's one of the few games that has actually made me throw my controller into the wall.  However, when it's on its game, it's ON it.  There's nothing that provides such a rush as Mirror's Edge when everything is clicking.  When you know what you're doing and where to go, the chase sections are pure adrenaline and extraordinarily well done and it all of a sudden blossoms from being very frustrating to massive exhilaration.  The feeling of freedom, speed, and ability to take on almost any obstacle in continuous flow without losing momentum while hearing cops shouting behind you to freeze, gunfire, bullets pinging and glass shattering all around you is an exceptional experience when it all comes together so seamlessly.  This is helped by the incredible presentation, most notably the sound design.  Faith breaths and grunts with every exertion, her footsteps rapidly tap on the pavement in an ever increasing tempo as you gain speed for a huge leap, all accompanied by a stellar soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood of speed and pursuit.  It's tense and keeps you on your toes at all the right moments.  Faith wasn't the only one catching her breath at the end of a good chase, let me tell you.Now, I can completely understand why some people hate this game.  It really does not give off a first good impression at all, and if you're one that's really short on patience I'd advise skipping it.  Trial and error is inherent to its gameplay structure, which is unfortunate as it'll turn off a lot of people from this amazingly innovative title.  It really is a brilliant attempt at something new that is sadly marred by a few questionable design decision and poor execution.  For how much you can get it for nowadays though (I got mine for $12), it's worth a shot.  What have you got to lose......except a controller or two?***tip-I'd highly recommend playing this on the \"\"Easy\"\" setting.  It only lessens the difficulty for the gunfights, which are the weakest part of the game anyway and should be bypassed whenever possible***\"", "There is just something about this game that drove me to finish it.First the look.  Lots of use of just one color in places.  Maybe a few colors.  But with modern cutting edge 3d modeling.  It's very Scandinavian.  No doubt because this game is made in Sweden.  Also I like the use of red to show you where to go.  Much less intrusive than arrows.Next up, the feel.  It feels great to make a jump or run along walls or disarm a guard or land or accelerate prior to jumping or kick open a door.  It hits hard.  Very visceral.First person view.  It mean no character taking up 1/3 of your screen.  It means it puts you into the game more completely.First person yet no weapons.  You can use weapons and I did a few times, but mostly I felt compelled to beat the game without guns.  Z'Last it is short.  It helps that the main story line is 7-8 hours.The mixed bag part of the game is the difficulty.  This is where folks will either hate the game or love it.  Personally I just loved it.  The difficulty was very controller throwing frustrating at times and yet is is also what makes it gratifying to finish.I probably couldn't have taken 20 hours of this difficulty, but 7-8 hours is fine.  I couldn't have standed it if an unoriginal game was this hard either.  But this game's fresh concept made it much easier to stick with until the end.They probably could have made disarming some of the more difficult soldiers easier.  It seemed like you had to press the button at the right milli-second and I could never do it consistently.I like games that attempt something new and original and yet are still easy to get into.  This is one of those games.", "\"I tried this game via GameFly because of its refreshingly new premise, but I was disgusted after less than two hours of playing.  Needless to say I sent it back the same day.  And to think that I was considering buying it at one time!  Ech!Okay, let's crack my knuckles and prepare to rant!  (Ha ha)The biggest problem is how often you'll die in this game, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah, I think you get it.  As you're being chased by cops (who for some reason seem to commit the city's entire police force just to stop you), you need to be on the lookout for your escape route, that next jump, that next ladder, that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the level's goal.  The problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden, so it's all too easy to pass them right by and run face-first into a dead end.  So by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back, you're cut off by the fuzz.  Oh, and did I mention the cops shoot?  Yes, they open fire on an unarmed, non-violent suspect.  And you drop dead after just a handful of hits.  Stopping to survey your surroundings isn't an option either, because the fast-moving cops are right on your arse; you need to be constantly moving if you don't want precious Faith painted red with her own blood.  Trying to fight the cops isn't the answer either since Faith is a lithe, agile athlete built for speed rather than combat; trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal, and will again get her painted red with her own blood.So it's a cheap trial-and-error system that's in place: you'll get painted red repeatedly, replaying the same segments over and over again, trying to find the obscure key passage.  The hints that Merc, your boss, feeds you over your radio is completely useless, since he says redundant crap like \"\"Cops are coming!  Get out of that building now!\"\" or \"\"Get off that roof, Faith!  I don't care how; just do it!\"\"  No, really?  Cops are coming?  Wow, Merc, you figure that out all by yourself?  Speaking of hints, holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction, nowhere near where you're actually supposed to go.Wait... I'm not done!The control scheme also suffers from bad design.  The \"\"Up Action\"\" function (which is the game's fancy-pants way of saying \"\"jump button\"\") is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function.  This function is mapped to the left bumper, one of the less reliable buttons on the 360 controller.  Your only alternative is the RIGHT bumper, the OTHER unreliable button.  Genius!I give the developer, Dice, kudos for trying something new.  I really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new: the free-running premise, the MTV-style cartoon cutscenes, and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh.  The city, in particular, is rendered in blinding, stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized.  This color palette does a good job of reinforcing the game's storyline wherein an all-powerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance, but at the cost of all freedoms.  The concepts that Dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry, but it's truly a shame the game's mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my head.Now, having said all this, I know all the fanboys out there will be looking to string me up, but I DON'T GIVE [...]If I don't like a game, guess what, I don't like it.  Games are meant to be enjoyable, not torturous.\"", "\"I was very excited about Mirror's Edge when I read about it.  It looked like a new, beautiful, and innovative game.  It looked really fun.  I was correct about new, beautiful, and innovative, but the fun seems to be missing.Mirror's Edge is an intense first-person run-and-jump platforming game similar to Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia but with a focus on speed.  The game's premise is that the player must quickly determine the most effective route from point A to point B across the rooftops pulling some insanely cool Hollywood style stunts along the way.  Graphically, the game is beautiful and I especially like the color palette.  In fact, the color palette is actually very important to gameplay as it represents your \"\"runner's sense\"\" and subtly shows you the correct route.  The idea behind the game is great.  The story, what I've seen at least, seems pretty good.  The problem is the gameplay falls apart and frequently results in repeated frustrating falls to your death in a trial and error fashion.My personal theory is that this game isn't finished yet, having been rushed out the door to be ready for Christmas.  The controls just don't feel tweaked and finished yet.  If the platforming and running controls had been completed before shipping the game, I think I'd have loved the game.  Examples of bad control:- Doing simple things, like jumping up onto a waist-high box or ledge, frequently requires multiple tries because you often jump too far or end up banging your shins on it and falling back down.  All the while, helicopters and cops are shooting at you and laughing because you can't climb onto a simple box as you run for your life.- Grabbing stuff sometimes just doesn't happen.  I don't know why, but sometimes I could grab a ledge or pipe and other times I couldn't even though it felt like I was doing the exact same thing.- The indoor environments are not as fun as they could be because they limit your ability to do what the character does best, which is RUN.  A lot of your maneuvers require that you build up a certain amount of momentum with a good long run, but being inside really kills your ability to build up speed properly which results in more trial and error situations than is really acceptable.- Combat is broken in my opinion.  When it works, combat makes you feel like you pulled off some sweet Jet Li action.  Unfortunately, reliably pulling those moves off takes far more practice than it should.  Don't worry though, because you'll get a lot of practice from all dying you'll do.  I could cope with a broken combat system though because combat is maybe 10%-15% of the game.Sadly, Mirror's Edge just isn't as good as the hype set it out to be.  The game controls feel rushed and unfinished, and I blame the industry tendency to push things out just in time for Christmas for that.  When things work, this game shines and feels awesome, but that feeling is often killed by frequent trial-and-error moments in the game.  What I really hope is that a sequel is released that addresses the issues I described above.\"", "\"There is a reason this game is less then 20! this game is terrible the combat is the worst. buttons should come up the screen and you preform other take downs! pressing Y for a quick take down is trash. even in slomo sucks! the game is beautiful too look at the detail is amazing! I thought \"\":wow! beautiful game\"\" yeah! it's a designer game. it's great too look at but the game play is a mess so is shooting. OH MY GOD! shooting an foe takes a bunch of bullets and what I don't get is. you get like NO AMMO! LIKE AT ALL! THIS GAME IS NOT FUN WHATSOEVER. I AM GOING TO SELL IT.\"", "\"This was one of those games that was made just to Showcase the Power of the systems...but its not really a game i would Play for a long period of time...plus Assassins Creed and every Spiderman game after part 2 have already tackled the whole \"\"Building Hopping\"\" theme and are Better Games than Mirrors Edge. i say try the Demo and see how you like it. good graphics. decent controls..but it wont keep you interested for long. try the demo of Mirrors Edge for Free on xbox Live..then try Assassins Creed for 15 bucks at Gamestop. better experience and 45 bucks cheaper.iLL .\"", "\"I really really want to like this game. Badly. But frankly, I don't.I was really looking forward to this game, it's ideas, concepts, graphical design, gameplay in a very vertical city. But it just doesn't work out like it should have.I like the general idea of doing this in first person, and it certainly is the best first person jump & run game I've ever seen. What they did with that is really amazing. But you know what? Once this aspect wears off and you get over that they made a mechanic work that isn't supposed to work, you realize that even though the jumping aspects work well for a first person game, they are horrible compared to a third person approach. Too many times do you fall to your death because you can't tell whether you could make a jump or not and where to jump off. Are you at the edge yet? No idea unless you stop and look down at your feet, which is something you can't generally do as the game is all about momentum.The first person perspective also means that you can't see all the awesome stuff you supposedly do. I would really like to see Faith (your character) do all this amazing stuff, but all you can see is the world slide by.The graphics are nice. It's a really unique artistic touch. But it also wears off, and eventually, you are just in a much less realistic looking city than you should be in this day and age. At times, you even get the impression this could be a title for the old xbox. (And I explicitly use the word \"\"impression\"\", because I realize this wouldn't have worked on the xbox, but the art style makes it rather hard for the developers to impress you, since it is too comicy at times).I was also disappointed that I never really got all that much of a sense of verticality. Sure, you go up and down or climb up on pipes the side of buildings, but too often, you are just on the rooftops which seem to form a new \"\"bottom\"\". Everything is very linear. Since you do not have the choice to go elsewhere (down in particular), it doesn't matter much that you are on roofs.The real problem with this game is that it isn't fun. It is all trial and error and not often did I get a sense of achievement. At the end of a level you are relieved you did it, but not satisfied. Things just don't often flow well. It is like a throw-back into the old days of jump & run with pixel-perfect jumps you have no way to time. You fall to your death a lot or get shot all the time. Never do you get a sense of \"\"holy moly this was an incredible thing I just pulled off with ease\"\" like you do when you play Prince of Persia (for instance), a relatively old offering at this point.This is a real bummer. First disappointment of the year. Not a bad game. It is still quite unique. But not the stellar experience I had hoped for.\"", "Just like other reviewers stated; repeative. The first few levels were ok then it was the same thing over and over. The story line didn't catch my interest so I basically skipped it and yes it's very frustrating at parts especially around the end of level 6. I would've given this one star but I gave it a little higher than that for gameplay originality.", "\"I've been more and more video games, thanks to a half-off rental deal, and finally pulled Mirror's Edge out of curiousity and a desire for something beyond Gears of War 2 and Fallout 3 (two games I like way more than this one).  The presentation is unique and it was a plus for me.  Everything from the menus to the levels and characters has a very distinct look about them and I like the cutscene animations, too.The tutorial is a good level where you learn the basics and the first level I played through was pretty exciting.  Until the last portion of the first level where your boss tells you over your radio: \"\"get out of there, I don't care how, just get out of there\"\" To me this is an invitation to get a little creative and see what ways I can get off the building while you have cops storming the building and shooting you.  The catch is that there is only one way off that building.  You don't really have a choice or any alternate route, you have one jump to make to get off that building and that's it.  Oh, you'll die 20 times trying to make that jump, but once you realize that the game is essentially you running on rails and getting punished for it, it loses a lot of its charm.There is, at its heart, a great idea.  And I can imagine gameplay like this in Grand Theft Auto's world would be sweet (Niko and Johnny are both pretty clunky compared to Faith's smooth moves).  Its a shame the only way they could build up the challenge was to kill the player like its going out of style (if I want to die, I'd go play a multiplayer FPS).  Seriously, this game is a $50 version of Pitfall.  I'm sure whatever sequel comes along will address these issues and I have higher hopes for the future.\"", "\"As the first game of its kind, Mirror's Edge takes a huge deviation from the norm in today's videogame world. The world of \"\"Free Runners\"\" is the setting for the game. For those who don't know, Free Runners are people that can do things such as run along walls, jump from building to building and they use any part of their environment to help them do these things. One part acrobat, one part cross country runner and one part thrill seeker, Free Runners personify a modern counter culture.Story 6 of 10The game takes place in a large fictional metropolis. Your main character - Faith has come back to running from some sort of hiatus. Runners in this game have a higher calling though. They solve crimes while jumping from roof to roof. Faith came into this occupation because her parents were killed in an activist rally - doesn't say what for. The primary storyline involves Faith, her sister, a detective and a new mayor. The new mayor is trying to make everyone forget the old city and the activists. It's a drab story to say the least (in my opinion). There is a twist which everyone could see coming and is almost superfluous to the game.Gameplay 7 of 10In Mirror's Edge, you'll be running, constantly - which is obvious. But you'll be doing it with style. You begin the game in an optional tutorial on how to run and jump. It's hard to describe what you'll be doing unless you've seen Free Runners in action. If you have, that's what you'll be doing, but on a grand scale. Note: this is a first person game. So you see through the eyes of Faith. About 80% of the time you'll be jumping and running, but 20% of the time you'll have to fight, well armed policemen and SWAT teams. Many have automatic weapons. You can steal the weapons or just beat the guys into the ground. I'd recommend both - beat them into the ground, steal the weapon and then shoot the other guys with his weapon. I know; they still managed to fit a FPS into a game about free running. Meh. Without this in the game I would have given the gameplay a 9 out of 10. Luckily these parts are few and far between until near the end of the game.So in all the gameplay is on the good side. Controls are tight, puzzles are varied and there is a relatively short learning curve. On the negative side of the gameplay, the combat parts are almost annoying to no end. In one run-in I had with SWAT. There were like six of them and I believe I played through 20 times before I was able to even make progress. Unfortunately, even when you do get past the first few guys, you might encounter another physical problem with your surroundings. Other than that, once you've mastered the basics of running, jumping, timing and grabbing on at the right spot the non-combat parts can be fun especially the second time through. The main issue you'll wind up having is just where to go and how you want to go about getting there; because there are multiple ways to arrive at your final destination.Graphics / Animation 8 of 10This is probably the easiest part of the game to quantify. Buildings look very accurate and are detailed to the \"\"t.\"\" In fact if you get really close to many materials, you can see the grains. For example, the pipes on the sides of building have etching on the metal and reflect differently than it would otherwise. Light and shadow are brilliantly executed. Since you are outside the majority of the time, this is very noticeable. Faces are better than average and give a definite human quality. They have age marks or show youth and bodies also look very human.Animation is of the utmost importance in a game like this and really looks impressive. You move with the fluidity that a real person would. The animation mapping is superior to most games. Arms and legs are clearly linked with the rest of the body. In the tutorial, you're supposed to keep up with one of your friends. The key here is that everything looks so natural.Sound / Music 6 of 10Faith's breathing is normally the only thing you notice while playing. This is because there is essentially no music. Sound effects are good for the physical parts such as hitting the ground hard or the fall of footsteps on concrete. But aside from that, the game is lacking greatly in music. It has some minimal synthesizer effects, but that's all. Clearly, no money was available here to purchase the rights to any music.Features and Replay Value 4 of 10Maybe lack of features is a better description, because Mirror's Edge has little to none. There is a story mode, with three difficulties, time trial mode and speed run mode. That's it. The story mode has nine chapters which will take about 8-10 hours to complete. Time trial mode involves short little parts (normally less than 2:00 min.) of the game in which you race to see how fast you can complete them - they are very difficult. You have three times in which you have to beat to get a one, two or three star rating. I only achieved a three star rating on one time trial and there are about 20-25.Then there is speed run, which is also a race where you race through the whole level to beat the allotted time. Even if you were to spend maybe a week on the story and a few weeks on the other two modes, you'll want to sell the game eventually. You won't say in a few months \"\"I think I'll go get completely annoyed by Mirror's Edge today.\"\" Because yeah, the game is annoying in many aspects. I believe I spent 2-3 hours trying to get a two star rating on one of the time trialsConclusionA really imaginative and risky idea for a game which turned out pretty well. But ends up getting bogged down in the obligatory shooting parts and lack of overall gameplay. This is a must rent, because it's really a cool game but you just won't want to keep it for very long. In terms of an overall rating, probably a 6+ would be accurate. I really like the fact that this developer rolled the dice on a game like this, but it could use improvement.\"", "\"Mirror's Edge is a very original game from Dice and EA.  I'm gonna stop and take a moment to realize that I just used ORIGINAL and EA in the same sentence.  ...  Ok, the apocalypse didn't happen.Mirror's Edge is a fully immersive first person parkour / free running game where you play as a runner named Faith.  She works for an underground resistance against a corrupt government.  Beautifully rendered Urban Jungles are her playground as she dashes from rooftop to rooftop, wall running, jumping, and climbing along the way.  The first person (3d view) free running in the game is pretty amazing.  You actually feel like you are doing all of these amazing things and it's incredibly exciting.Mirror's Edge also shows you exactly where you need to go.  It highlights the 'trick lines' red as you get near them.  Success depends on timing and correct button presses.  Most of the time, it's easy to figure out where you need to go and it's a blast getting there.Here comes the bad...  The checkpoints are fairly generous, but you die for any slight mistake.  If your timing is a bit off, you die.  If you hit the wrong button, you die.  If enemies are shooting at you and you slow down, you die.  When there are enemies shooting at you, it's literally a hail of gunfire.  It doesn't matter if you turn a corner, they fire nonstop.  It's like there's a floating barge of machine guns just behind the camera.The combat is also bad.  You can perform martial arts on the cops and you can kick out of any free running move.  Wall run kick, sliding kick, jumping kick...  The problem is that there are a lot of cops and if you try to fight one, the rest end up shooting you.  You can press a button to slow time and that helps you disarm them, but that's all you get.  If your timing is off while you are disarming an enemy, they kill you.  At one point, I took a cop's shotgun, put the cursor over his face and pulled the trigger at point blank range... and missed.  The cop killed me.The game looks beautiful, but when it plays a cutscene, it's completely cell shaded.  They look like Esurance Commercials.  I expected someone to yell, \"\"Quote, Buy, Print!\"\"  I dunno who was in charge of this, but cutscenes are supposed to look BETTER than the gameplay.There also isn't much chance to explore the levels and unlike Assassin's Creed, the game is very linear.  Replay Value is pretty nonexistent, unless you want to try the time trials, where you play through the levels fast.The game is 9 Chapters long and should take you about 7-8 hours to finish.Overall, when you create an innovative game, you don't have the time to solve all of the original problems that you find and the execution ends up being flawed.  If they do a sequel, it will probably be really good.Who should buy this game?Buy it if you are a fanboy, a collector, or you love Esurance.Rent it if you liked the demo, have a low threshold for deaths, and want to experience free running.Otherwise, avoid this one.Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed are better.\"", "\"The Good: Amazing graphics, art style, and soundtrack, smooth tight controls, all your parkour moves are here, decent storyThe Bad: Extremely short, combat is a bit cumbersome, time trials can be almost impossible to master, steep learning curve for controls, can we say Portal rip offs?For one, I rarely buy games like this on day one without knowing that I'll at least want to play it 2 or 3 times and Mirror's Edge was a great buy, but I wish I would have waited for a price drop first. Now don't get me wrong go spend $60 on this and you'll have one hell of a time, but for the length and content ME cuts it a bit short. ME is a parkour/free running/building jumping/limber skinny people running around like monkeys on roof tops game and is very well executed.The first thing I'd like to mention is the warming soundtrack EA created for this game. EA has finally listened to the fans and got rid of the horrible EA Trax; a bunch of wannabe punk and metal bands mixed with lame hip hop and R&B; that everyone with half a brain and decency turns off. EA's new IPs (Dead Space and ME) have an original rich sound track that fits the game very well. ME has a slow soothing OST with lots of low bass and some poppy techno thrown in. The game's main theme by Lisa Miskovsy (ironically titled \"\"Still Alive\"\") is a charming song that really gets the feeling of the game across: A woman, and message deliverer for the resistance, named Faith who's sister was framed for murder and she must find the killer of the person her sister, Kate, was framed for and must bring all of this to an end. In a rebuilt city corrupt and full of backstabbers Faith must scour the rooftops to find entrances into buildings to find her targets.Scouring these rooftops is both fun and beautiful thanks to the game's amazing graphics. EA's next-gen engine (used and updated from skate.) makes ME one of the best looking games ever made. Everything is highly detailed with buildings as far as the eye can see, reflections off of windows and everything is just highly detailed. The game looks similar to Portal (hmmm...just mere coincidences here?) with lots of HDR lighting and lots of blinding whites, blues, reds, and oranges. The art style really helps the game's feel and works brilliantly. The cut scenes however are a bit different and detract from the feel of the game with cell shading similar to those eSurance commercials (with that hot pink haired eSurance chick that has tons of porn available everywhere). While this style works it really is a detraction from the actual game. The voice acting is really good here, and the characters are decent except Faith is the only character you get attached to thanks to the game's absurdly short length (6-8 hours depending on how you play).Now back to how the game plays, it plays well and feels well with a few flaws. The game's control scheme has it's plate full with lots of different button combos that take a little while to get used to let alone master. You have all of the parkour moves available to you such as building jumping, wall running, pole swinging, zip lines, three step jumps (LB, RB, LB), wall climbing, shimmying etc. Additionally you can make runs faster by pulling your legs up instead of double stepping jumps or hopping over rails. This makes time trials go faster and keeps your speed up. Finding your way in ME is fairly simple since you have \"\"Runner's Vision\"\" which makes certain items turn red and you use them according to what they are. Boards leading off buildings usually means to jump down, small objects in front of a larger object means you double step your jump and vault to a ledge, you can crawl in vents, and a lot of time you must climb poles attached to walls and even jump to them! The game is fast and is very smooth, and you don't have to afraid of sluggish controls. The whole game is responsive and reacts on your command.The biggest flaw in the game however is the combat. Most of the enemies have guns and you don't...this always proves a problem. Most of the time you just run away but when you're forced to fight you must take on 5+ enemies in one room using melee combat, jumping kicks, sliding kicks to the nuts etc. The combat itself works well, but actually using it against enemies with machine guns, shotguns etc. doesn't work out too well. Try taking down 5 guys in one room with shotguns just with your fists...not too easy. This requires disarming (timing is a must of course) and either using their guns against other enemies in classic FPS action or just being very fast and outsmarting the enemy with kicks off of walls and all that. While the combat is manageable it's flawed and makes up most of the trial and error in the game. The game has little trial and error outside combat since most of the deaths are on the player. Try finding out where to go, without runner's vision, while 10 guys are shooting at you; that can be very tough to do and some spots I had to try 20+ times just to get it all right.With that flaw aside ME proves to be an amazing game and should be played by all FPS fans, parkour fans, or just action adventure game fans (PoP fans can come out of hiding now!) With ME's wonderful soundtrack, graphics, art style, story, and game play you will stay busy with the time trials and speed runs. I hope ME2 improves upon all of this and I will be there when it comes out.\"", "A 1st person free running game that has you delivering messages high above the city. The skyland is simply stunning. I recommend this game for anyone who's afraid of heights, you'll be jumping off of skyscrapers to other buildings barely escaping deadly falls. The falls are freaking awesome to see.Running on walls, sliding under pipes, climbing over fences, hanging off edges, swinging from high bars, climbing up pipes, all things that flow effortlessly when you get down the controls. Along with cops & snipers there are some parts that will have you frustrated for a bit. Once you figure out what to do & where to go things come together really fast. One thing this game isn't lacking is style, DICE crafted a game with lots of character & a look all it's own. While not a huge game you can tell they put alot of hard work & time into it.", "Mirror's Edge is a bit of a one-trick pony, once you've mastered the controls it's all about running, jumping, dodging, rinse and repeat. The environments are nice and clean, the music is somber, and there's a lack of violence which gives it almost a zen-like quality of gaming; but you're constantly moving on to the next goal or area, so there's no time to stop and smell the roses. Getting through the game doesn't take too long and might not present the greatest challenge; close encounters with enemies are the only time you'll really have to be tactical. The charm of the game is it's unique presentation, and everything stands and falls on your willingness to take on something different. You have to readjust from your typical shooter experience, because this is nothing like it. The timing and tactics are vastly different. After a few days, when you've made it through the campaign, there are also some time attacks and trials to face and unlock; but therein lies the problem as well, it would've been more fun to go into any of them whenever you want to, find your way around your favourite and then fine-tune your time based on that. Attempting the time trials, I was quickly discouraged to continue. It was just too tricky to make that perfectly timed leap or sprint, and unless you find the concept of speedruns and time trials absolutely gripping, there's little incentive to keep on failing (as I see it). If you just love shaving that extra second or five-hundreds of a second off your best time, this is the game to get. If you just want to have fun and play, perhaps you're inclined to save some money by loaning or just renting it.", "Pros:+Unique gameplay mechanics+Fantastic visuals+Superb soundtrack+The first person perspective adds a lot of intensity to some of the game's better momentsCons:-Some trial and error moments-Incredibly shortFrom the looks of it you'd think Mirror's Edge was the slickest, most original game to hit the industry in a while. It's a first person adventure that has you running and sometimes gunning. Mostly, however, you'll be sliding and jumping. At first glance, Mirror's Edge should be an awesome experience. It can be, but there are a couple of things that keep it from reaching excellence.The story is told mostly through cutscenes in the game's unique art style. While the story itself is interesting, it probably isn't the reason you've really come to Mirror's Edge. The highlight is the gameplay, mainly because it's so unique.It can take a while to get used to gameplay mechanics used here. For the most part you'll be ducking, sliding and jumping all over the place. There's a bit of gunplay thrown in there, but it's quite clear that it isn't important (and being an expert on first person shooters won't give you an edge). You can also disarm your enemies and perform melee combat moves on them. It take a moment to get the timing of disarming right, but the game works with the player very well. You can slow things down, but most important, you want to go for disarming someone when their weapon flashes red.It may seem that with such open environments and worlds that Mirror's Edge would be difficult to know where you're supposed to go. Despite what it seems, Mirror's Edge is actually quite linear. More often than not it's pretty easy to see where you need to go. This is because the game often paints a red picture for you. If you need to scale a pipe or kick open a door, it's usually red. Getting through levels can be a test in trial and error, however. Momentum and speed is important in Mirror's Edge but so is timing and precision. You might find yourself missing several ledges because you were a little off in your timing or your angle. Some jumps can be difficult. Make no mistake about it, you'll probably die. When you get a good stride going, though, Mirror's Edge becomes immensely fun.In the long run, Mirror's Edge is actually a simpler game than you might expect. The first person perspective adds something to it as well. You'll find that when you need to run from your adversaries or even just disarming them, there's a thrill that the first person perspective adds that you wouldn't get were it in third person. This is also due to the movement of the camera and the fast pacing of the action. It's easy to feel a rush while playing.Without a doubt, the biggest strength of Mirror's Edge is easily its visual presentation. It's very unique, fluid and detailed. It fits the game perfectly. Even better may be the soundtrack. Nothing feels better than getting into a good stride while the game's music plays. It fits each and every situation really well.The only real problem is that the fun just doesn't last long enough. Mirror's Edge is an incredibly short game. The campaign is over in a flash. Luckily, there are some extras and you may even find yourself playing through the main campaign again.", "Mirror's Edge is unlike any game you've ever played. Except maybe Portal. While Portal features a gun that allows you to create Portals and walk, run, jump, or fall into and out of them, and Mirror's Edge features a super-human parkour runner who can run across walls, fall through glass ceilings, and get shot, and keep on running faster than any human being alive, they share a common gameplay style.The story has been much criticized, but it was never important to begin with. In a 1984ish dystopian future, the fight against the establishment is aided by runners who carry messages across the city parkour-style. You play the runner Faith, who during a routine job finds herself being shot at, and shortly thereafter finds herself running from place to place through the city chased by the police in an attempt to clear her murder-suspect sister's name.The cinemas are Heavenly Sword/Flash Animation style cut-scenes that you'll either dig or not, but the main game features incredibly realistic yet incredibly austere depictions of an empty metropolis you get to traverse in the course of the game. The sense of speed, and the uncanny realism of BEING inside of a character as she runs, rolls, climbs, and leaps through this gameworld is unparalleled. She gasps for breath, huffs and swings her arms faster as she gains momentum, and makes wince-inducing sounds every time you hit the ground too hard or take a hit.Where you run into the love/hate relationship of this game is the puzzle/chase aspect of the game which is the actual gameplay. Just as some people undoubtedly hated the game Portal because of the incredibly frustrating precision timing needed to get past certain areas (which resulted in replaying entire sections over and over again or not being able to figure out how to escape from a room for hours), this game similarly has chase sequences where you will die. And die. And die again. Simply because you don't know where to go or what to do, and the Blues are right behind with bullets flying. And it's not just the thrilling action sequences which can drive you to the edge. The puzzle filled empty rooms once again recall the irritation you may have felt with Portal. Just as a misstep in that game put you neck deep in acid, a misstep in this game often sends you plummeting toward the ground to end in a sickening crunch.What saves this frustration from making the game worthless is the fact that surviving action sequences is often a matter of keeping your momentum going, and not fighting anyone unless absolutely necessary. Getting past rooms is often a matter of following the bright red signposts, pressing the B button to see where to go next, and remembering what you are capable of. Like Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time, in an empty room you will often wonder just how the heck you are supposed to get where you need to go, only to get the sinking feeling that you know exactly how but it ought to be impossible (run across the wall, spin 180 degrees, and leap across the room to grab a thin pipe, all in a smooth singular motion, run across a wall and then leap out into space). The thrill you get from accomplishing these superhuman puzzle feats and chasing or fleeing enemies successfully is outstanding (and I still want to yell every time in Portal and in this game when I leap through the air).There are a few missteps in the game's design that think should have been changed. While they are somewhat enjoyable, the puzzle sections are a bit long and distract from the game's momentum. And while the game is very beautiful, the curious lack of people except for yourself and the Blues seems oddly out of place (again, just like Portals, you get a very lonely feeling from extended play), like this would have been the ultimate chase-action game if only the streets and building were full of people to run around, dodge, and perhaps even catch or vault over. Those would be my suggestions should a sequel ever be made.In the end, this game has loads of replay value, but only if you are the sort of person who enjoys not just playing a game, but playing it well. If you've played through Ikaruga in search of higher score multipliers, if you played Space Channel 5 trying to get the whole crowd to follow you, and especially if you played Portals trying to accomplish puzzles in the fewest moves and record times, you will enjoy this game. This is the sort of game that is frustrating to bumble through, but very satisfying to flying through. You may find yourself after a play-through turning up the difficulty, turning off the targeting reticule, and going for record time. It's that kind of game. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely an enjoyable thrill-ride of a puzzler for those who enjoy unique games off the beaten path. Those who love first-person shooters should stay clear. Oh, and I would recommend playing the console version instead of the PC version, because the lag in Portal on the PC made me very motion-sick, but not so on the Xbox 360 version (console games sacrifice graphics for frame-rate consistency and PC titles the opposite). For what it's worth I find this game thrilling, if a bit frustrating (but not enough to make me dislike it). But then again, I was raised on a game that resulted in dying over and over and over for slight jumping mistakes and simply TOUCHING enemies (and I loved it). You may remember it: Super Mario Bros.", "\"My first impression of Mirror's Edge was that it looked extremely unique. After playing it, I can say that my assessment was spot on. I have never before played a game quite like Mirror's Edge, and I have reason to believe that you haven't either.Imagine a world where everything is censored and monitored. You can't even send an email or a letter without a government middleman stepping in. All the phone lines are tapped. everything on the internet is closely monitored. How would you then transport sensitive or private information? That is where \"\"runners\"\" come into the picture. These parkour practitioners will get your package delivered safely, discretely and effectively without anyone knowing. Traveling across the rooftops of towering skyscrapers, through ventilation systems, or whatever else will get them to their destination the fastest, these people will get your items delivered in record time. In Mirror's Edge, you play one such runner named Faith. Faith's mission is much more important than delivering a package - her sister Kate, who is a cop (or a \"\"blue\"\" as the runners call them) has been framed for murder. Faith is trying to uncover the truth and prove her sister's innocence.Mirror's Edge is played in the first person view point, and while there is very brief gun-play, it is not a first person shooter. It is more akin to a first person platformer or adventure. You always have a destination you are trying to reach, and you may use anything in the environment that you can grab onto, jump off of, or run across to reach your goal. If you ever get lost, and don't know where to head, you can hold down the B button (on Xbox 360) and Faith will automatically look in exactly the direction you need to be heading. Additionally, any object that you can grab or jump from is highlighted red when you come near (except on hard mode). Faith is very fragile, so if you fall from very high, she will die. Additionally, if \"\"blues\"\" are in the vicinity, combat is best avoided unless it is a directive. While Faith knows hand to hand combat, she will still die in just 2 or 3 hits.Mirror's Edge has very tight controls, though they take a few minutes to adjust to. Once you have them down, which should take about half an hour at most, you'll be scaling rooftops, sliding under pipes and throat chopping blues like you did it for a living. I'll be using the Xbox 360 controller to explain the controls, as this is the system I played the game on. As you probably guessed, the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls where you are looking. There is no need to press or hold a button to run faster. As you move, you slowly gain speed and momentum - so, if you need to make a long jump from one room to another, all you need is the proper distance to gain the momentum. Speaking of, jumping is handled by the left bumper, which also controls grabbing ledges. This may feel awkward at first, but ultimately this makes the game easier to control and more fluid. The right bumper causes you to perform a 180 degree turn. So, if you press left bumper at a will, you will wall run up the wall about 4 steps. If you then press right bumper while on the wall, immediately followed by the left bumper again, you will kick off the wall in the opposite direction. When you land when jumping or falling from a great height, you will need to press left trigger with the proper timing to roll upon landing and break your fall. Left trigger also causes you to crouch while on the ground, or the slide while running, allowing to to slide under pipes, doors, etc. The A button is used to interact with buttons such as elevator calls, the X button enters \"\"reaction time\"\", which is slow motion and can be used once per stage. As previously mentioned, holding B will cause Faith to look at your goal. the right trigger handles attacking as well as barging into doors. When you press the right trigger while stationary, Faith will punch. While crouching, it will cause her to kick. If you run, crouch and then press the right trigger, she will slide kick. Finally, if you jump and press the right trigger, she will perform a jump kick. If you get close to a \"\"blue\"\", and he tries to melee you, his weapon will at some point during his swing flash red, usually for only a brief second. If at this time you press Y, you will disarm and take out that enemy. Additionally, if there is a weapon lying on the ground from a defeated enemy, you may press Y to pick it up, and fire with the right trigger. Gun-play is a tad sloppy, but I think they intended this. Faith is not a sharpshooter - she is a runner. She is not good with guns. This isn't a huge setback, however. The Y button also drops a weapon if you are holding one.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are truly gorgeous.The detail on clothing, such as Faith's pants, is astounding. Environments have a mostly sterile feel, being mostly white. This is offset by the glowing red objects that you may utilize. When inside of buildings, there is usually a central pastel color theme - usually blue, green, orange, or yellow. The lighting in this game is also very bright. Occasionally, it can be a tad blinding. Perhaps this effect was desired, but it may be annoying occasionally. If this becomes a problem, try adjusting the brightness settings in the game or on your television. Cutscenes surprisingly don't use these gorgeous visuals. They instead use a beautiful art style of their own. They are 2D and cel shaded, giving cutscenes a distinct anime look, but with enough flavor of its own for it not to technically be anime.Mirror's edge has a bit of replay value as well. Though the campaign is relatively short, there are several challenge and speedun maps, more of which can be downloaded will keep you occupied for a while if you let them. Additionally, each level in the story has 3 hidden runner bags. These bags, dropped or left behind by other runners are cleverly hidden and require tricky tactics to reach. A nice touch for the completionist out there.I honestly don't have a lot of complaints about mirror's edge. It is a very unique experience. Difficulty mostly stems from combat, and if you get stuck you'll find a solution relatively quickly. The story is also quite short. The music, which mostly consists of piano melodies and techno, is almsot unnoticeable most of the time. This makes it relaxing, however.If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket, and you are looking for a unique game to occupy you for a bit, Mirror's Edge is well worth looking into.\"", "I had this game for over a year and I wasn't sure if I was ever going to play it.  A couple of times I thought about selling it, but man am I glad I didn't.  This was one of the most exhilarating  gaming experiences I have ever had.  Incredible free form running is the best part about the whole game.  It also has a solid story, great music, and they created an incredibly believable futuristic city.  I really hope they make a sequel to this, the potential for this franchise is limitless.", "\"Maybe it's my fascination with the stunning vibrancy of the art design...maybe it's the intensely powerful, emotionally connecting soundtrack...maybe it's my love for Asian women...or maybe it's all of these things combined with everything else that this startlingly impacting game offers that make it the best game of 2008, the second best in the 360's library (after...you guessed it...Modern Warfare), and one of the most underrated games in the history of the industry...\"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" is a game that was indeed hyped as revolutionizing first-person gaming...and I dare state that that's precisely what it has done. Note that I didn't say \"\"first-person shooters;\"\" despite the fact that there is limited gunplay involved within the game, it is indeed possible (and rewarded) to avoid it altogether (and it makes the game that much more interesting in doing so)...and this is *exactly* what is so revolutionary here. The entire first-person game market is absolutely saturated with clones of truly great first-person shooters (Call of Duty 4 and Far Cry 2, e.g.)...but where has the innovation been? Didn't anyone ever think that there was more potential in the current generation to first-person gaming than simply mindlessly running and gunning? Apparently, DICE recognized this potential, and what they've done here is not only *revolutionary* for first-person gaming, but \"\"platformer\"\" gaming to boot (a genre generally written off these days).Most unfortunately for mature gamers seeking innovation, style, and charm, first-person games that don't focus on gunplay and gruesome violence don't have a prayer sales-wise on any platform outside of Wii (which simply wouldn't be able to pull off the fresh style of this game successfully), and as the weak numbers came in, this game was deemed a \"\"flop\"\" by those who deem themselves worthy of applying such labels. Ultimately, this game slipped under the radar, and seemingly disappeared in the crowd of bloodier, angrier first-person games clearly aimed at the ten-to-twenty age group (despite the \"\"M\"\" ratings that do nothing to deter (but everything to highlight) the violence (and its degree) that they'll be salivating over (especially since every chain but the biggest sells these games to kids without a second of hesitation)). In my opinion, this game \"\"failed\"\" (to sell three million as estimated) because expecting a \"\"T\"\"-rated game to sell well, period (again, excluding Wii), is a bit of a stretch of the imagination in this day-and-age (most inevitably). More significant, however (e.g. \"\"Dead Space;\"\" insanely gory, yet still \"\"failed\"\"), is the \"\"problem\"\" that one can't go online and attack another in one manner or another (most certainly a deal-breaking issue for a good portion of potential purchasers (the kids mentioned above, predominantly)). While I offer my condolences, DICE, this is a genuinely awe-inspiring game, and regardless of how well the game ultimately sells (a sequel and continuously lower prices should eventually push \"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" over two million), this is exactly what we, the mature gamers of the world, are looking for; we are growing in number, and we are willing (and able) to pay full price for games that are genuinely worth our money.Anyway, back to the game; my first experience with it was, probably like most, seeing the mediocre reviews (namely IGN's) pile up and wondering what the game really entailed. \"\"Parkour?\"\" \"\"Weird...and lame.\"\" I'd imagine that I wasn't alone with this initial sense of disinterest in the title, and frankly, it wasn't a title I was even interested in renting. Fortunately, one day I decided to finally upgrade my 360 by connecting to XBOX Live for the first time (I'd wanted an upgrade to the new firmware), and the first thing I decided to do was see what demos were available...and there it was. As demos are free, I decided to dedicate a GB of my 250 GB monthly download maximum to \"\"Mirror's Edge\"\"...and by no means did I expect to find what I did. I was nothing less than instantly enthralled with this title; from the striking artistic style (backed up by the very smoothly-running engine) to the brilliant soundtrack (really, the music couldn't have asserted the game's style any better, and it's worth a purchase in its own right) to the incredible sense of vertigo when jumping across rooftops a thousand feet in the sky, I fell in love with the game at first glance. Upon completing this demo (it's short, despite its file size), I immediately went and ordered a copy of the title on my own, and patiently awaited its receipt in the mail. A week later, I found myself spending an entire weekend playing this game (by the way, ignore what you've heard about the game's length; when you're learning the levels for the first time, it's as long as or longer than most titles on the market (especially if you take the time to find the best path (not always the one highlighted in red))), and I absolutely loved every second of it. It's been some time since I found myself hopelessly addicted to a game (probably since Far Cry 2, a game that despite being based on violent gunplay, makes tremendous use of its stunning backdrop and is highly memorable and fun to play as a result), but I simply could not stop playing \"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" until it was over...and immediately started a new journey after its completion.You've probably been reading about the game's inadequacies with its controls, and how \"\"frustrating\"\" it can be to find the \"\"right\"\" path, but folks, platforming is platforming...and that's what it's all about. Granted, you might be pulling your hair out by the scaffolding section in stage eight (the red paths are few and far between; the gradual decline in pace beginning in stage seven is perhaps the game's only real flaw), but solving the puzzles and finding the path are quite rewarding, as it can literally take twenty or more attempts (deaths, rather) to find your way. However, you'll often (usually) find that when you've struggled and had to replay a section twenty times, your impatience and/or inability to successfully complete wall jumps correctly were to blame. Take it from me; you *must* *master* every jump in this game (especially L-jumps off walls) *before* beginning the journey. I failed to do this, and spent a great deal of time dying as a result. Upon replaying the game, I was amazed at the simplicity of these once seemingly impossible moves, and being able to do them right the first time, every time, made the game that much more fun and flow that much smoother. That said, \"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" is far from the most difficult game I've ever played, and it's not too challenging to turn away casual gamers, so it's hard to criticize the game even on this level. With practice and *proper* training (again, master every move *before* leaving the training stage, or I promise you that you'll be regretting it (especially by stage seven)), this game can, and will, flow beautifully, but it's up to *you* to make it happen; don't fail to put in the time to learn what's required, then rant about how \"\"frustrating\"\" and miserable it all is...you're to blame, not the game.In conclusion, if you're not playing \"\"Mirror's Edge,\"\" you're either content joining the masses with their mindlessly sadistic first-person shooters, or you're simply unaware that this game exists and are depriving yourself of a truly original, intense, exciting, and thoroughly exceptional gaming experience. Considering that EA has dropped the retail price to [...](like \"\"Dead Space,\"\" they obviously realize that if they can simply get the game into more hands, the sequel has great potential for financial success), unless you only play online games, and/or refuse to play anything without excessive blood and gore (again, aimed at those ten-year-olds I mentioned above), you have no excuse to pass this one up. At the very least, download the demo and give the game a chance...DICE deserves that much for *finally* doing something innovative and giving us something new, and personally, nothing would disgust me more than to see the sequels scrapped due to disinterest (or unawareness) of this terrific product. Make no mistake; despite receiving only a 79% score (various sites supply the same review summation), this it not only a \"\"triple-A\"\" game, but one of the best games currently available, period. Ignore what you thought you knew about it, and reviews that I feel completely missed the point of the game (style, innovation, and above all, *fun*), and simply give it a chance...you deserve it (and again, so does DICE)!p.s. feed Scruffy! Hahaha...if you've played the game, you'll know what I'm talking about. Funniest thing ever in a video game, hands down.Edit: 7/8/09  I've been playing this game for about six weeks now, and I still can't put it aside.  I can't tell you how many times I've played through the entire story (I don't care too much about the speed runs or time trials), but it's well over ten, and I just can't bring myself to play anything else.  When will I tire of this game, I wonder; perhaps not until \"\"Modern Warfare 2,\"\" or maybe even \"\"Mirror's Edge 2\"\" (it's thankfully been confirmed).  While it might not be technically perfect, the simple fact of the matter is that what is good in this game is *so* good that it quite easily overshadows the negatives (basically, it's a \"\"12\"\" brought down to a \"\"9.5,\"\" for me, due mainly to the forced combat that everyone hates (though you will learn to properly time those disarms, in time) and the drop in energy level (and increase in frustration) in chapters seven and eight)).  This is what I believe most critics have failed to properly recognize; they've rated it mostly in terms of mechanics...as a \"\"game,\"\" starting from the same 1-10 scale that they place \"\"Gears of War\"\" and \"\"Halo 3\"\" in the nines on..\"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" is not a game.  It is a truly transcendent, stunningly beautiful, mind-altering *experience*...and this is what separates it from just about every other \"\"video game\"\" out there.  It is simply light-years beyond everything else on the market in terms of fun, re-playability, ingenuity, and most importantly, impact, and it is *the* benchmark, at least for me, for games to meet from its creation forth.  I'm quite anxious for the \"\"game\"\" that will overpower my absolute obsession with, and love for, \"\"Mirror's Edge.\"\"  Quite frankly, it might never happen...and it looks like it's time to start listing some (most) of my titles for sale, because I doubt that I can go back to the level of \"\"gaming\"\" that once seemed so impressive...and now so lackluster in comparison.  This game was never given a fair chance by critics, as it was so over-hyped and boasted about by DICE (unrealistic, arrogantly high sales estimates, etc.) that everyone was simply salivating at the chance to tear it apart.  See through the \"\"reviews\"\"...and take it from someone who's played them all; find yourself a copy of \"\"Mirror's Edge,\"\" and don't look back into the sea of mediocrity that is comprised of those 9.5-rated, play-through-once-and-forget titles that the 360's image is based on...you deserve better than that.\"", "\"Have you ever started watching a new TV series that was really interesting, with superb artistic flair, and it was just very compelling overall?  With a pilot episode on television, you can get a rough idea of the great potential of a series, but it's not without some serious problems and issues that will undoubtedly get worked out if the series is greenlit. Well, with Mirror's Edge, this is like the \"\"pilot episode\"\" to what could be one of my favorite game IPs in the last five years. It's got an awesome concept, the art design is awesome, the 1st-person parkour style is very well done, it gets your adrenaline pumping in a good way, but it definitely has some serious issues that probably will get worked out with subsequent game releases.You essentially play as a living-on-the-edge messenger who transports private messages between people who do not want the 1984-esque government to stick their noses into their business. These \"\"runners\"\" are parkour athletes who perform all sorts of risk filled acrobatics across the rooftops and city streets in order to deliver the messages. The main character, Faith, is one of these and before you know it, is trying to clear her sister's name for a high-profile murder that's been pinned on her. It's an interesting premise, but not very well executed. I really didn't care much about Faith, who is woefully underdeveloped, or any of the support characters that are involved throughout. This is unfortunate because the setting really provides the material for a great story, but alas. Cinematics are delivered via Esurancelike commercials that are catchy, but not very good for conveying a story. Poor story and underdeveloped characters aside, however, Mirror's Edge has a lot to offer.The art design on display here is absolutely spectacular! The city all looks like it is brand new, shining beautifully in contrast to the decidedly dark story premise for the setting. Oftentimes the levels are designed mono-chromatically, with a single bright color contrasted with the stark white that is ever present. It's beautiful, to say the least, and I really enjoyed my time with the game that way. I cannot recall very many games recently that had such a compelling, unique setting as I thought Mirror's Edge had. The music is also quite good, with a very ambient, cool electronica focus.The gameplay in Mirror's Edge is a bit of a mixed bag and is where most of its problems lay. The first-person view is very, very well done and you get a genuine sense of weight and momentum while playing. Bravo on that. The focus in gameplay here is on adrenaline induced speed over calculation that other platformers of this nature (likePrince of Persia, for instance) focus on. The problem with this, is that to encourage you to go as fast as possible, they constantly have you outrunning bullets, and unless you know exactly where to go (this game gives you hints by coloring parts of the environment you're supposed to go off of a very saturated red color), you will die countless cheap deaths due to pressure from the omnipresent wall of turrets behind your back. You will also die numerous cheap deaths because the detection for grabbing on poles and ledges can be spotty. The combat is also atrocious and probably the worst part of the game. For every moment of incredible parkour success, there is equal if not more frustration from a broken mechanic or cheap death. I'd say this game is equal parts frustration because of the aforementioned problems and exhilarating thrill from success. That said, the good outweigh the bad by a little bit in the gameplay department.If anything, Mirror's Edge is one of the most refreshing, unique games I've played this entire console generation. I played it over a year and a half ago the first time, and whenever I reflect on the games I like the most in recent memory, images of Mirror's Edge's awesome art design and well-executed first-person platforming (in the moments it truly works perfectly anyway) always come to mind quite quickly. To be sure, this game also pissed me off more than most when I played it at the time too. It's a mixed bag. If DICE makes a sequel, where most if not all of the problems from this game are fixed, I can guarantee it will be in my top 5 games of this generation, without a doubt. A refined \"\"Mirror's Edge 2\"\" would be amazing, and according to DICE, it's happening, but not much more than that is known. I can't wait. In the meantime, Mirror's Edge 1 will be a nice little \"\"pilot episode\"\" to enjoy, warts an' all. If you're looking for a refreshing, unique world to play parkour in, but not without some faults, then give Mirror's Edge a try. Encourage the publishers and developers to make another by buying this one new. It's a decent price now, so why not? Buy it, parkour all over it, and feel the virtual breeze through your hair as you sprint, roll, and fly through this beautiful, dystopian city.\"", "Still one of my favorite all time classics on the 360. The achievements are challenging, but really fun, plus it looks amazing in HD, and the gameplay and controls are still pretty unique.", "I absolutely loved Mirror's Edge when I first bought it and played it.The action was immense, the graphics were very clean, the story was cool, the controls were nice, the voice acting was perfect, and the challenge was very good.But it didn't last very long...  Only about 5 hours or so.This game is more of a rent rather than an actual buy.But it's very nice, so you should consider trying it.Hopefully the sequel will have the length and other mistakes corrected."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.010026208125054836, 0.005802343599498272, 0.05586148053407669, 0.012793157249689102, 0.045008961111307144, 0.03970801457762718, 0.08508917689323425, 0.02744089812040329, 0.03319926932454109, 0.04206862300634384, 0.05113852396607399, 0.09352557361125946, 0.031840354204177856, 0.025146925821900368, 0.006871991325169802, 0.0013421126641333103, 0.010472476482391357, 0.000529742450453341, 0.03516090288758278, 0.018467523157596588, 0.011176304891705513, 0.0729852244257927, 0.0769781842827797, 0.0554007887840271, 0.03976060822606087, 0.06902889162302017, 0.04317580536007881]]}
