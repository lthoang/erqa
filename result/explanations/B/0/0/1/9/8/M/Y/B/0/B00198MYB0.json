Sorry XP guys, never had a vista issue, but the supplied software with this (WinTV, Ulead Movie Factory) does not cut it. Unstable and even in XP compatible mode. Any/all updates applied. Luckily I have Roxio Creator 2009 and it sees the unit and does its thing. Don't depend on the supplied software. The hardware has been flawless.

I purchased a ITX Motherboard (7\"\"x7\"\"x3\"\") installed, with a intel dual core 2 1.80Ghz CPU, 1 GB Ram, and Slimline DVD. (Nice for STB's),([...] Comes all together, and I picked it up with a 320GB drive for under $400.  I dropped this Hauppauge tuner on the USB, and loaded windows XP, and MS Media center.  Runs fine.But what I want is a PVR that gives me Music, Photos, Video, youtube, News, Weather, Streaming.... like free MythTV for Linux.  (There is a mythtv for each distribution).  I installed the actual MythTV, which is pretty manual.A better way is to install mythbuntu 8.10.  This is a simple download, burn the CD, install, configure a few things and you are running.  However to watch TV you need to have a bit of patience and you will need to install the pvrusb2 driver, and extract the firmware from the windows drivers that the pvrusb2 driver looks for so it can decode the mpeg2 video stream.  I will give you some links. If you follow Mark's instructions carefully, you will have a full working mythtv implementation in about an hour.  (I basically installed this because I went from DirectTV to FIOS TV, and my PVR on DirectTV could record about 50 hours of Hi-Def. The Fios PVR can't get in more than 18-20 Hours Max, and both the FIos PVR and DIrectTV PVR have a 160GB Drive...  In this way, yea, I have to say FIOS sucks compared to DirectTV, but the bundle is saving me $1200 a year.).  So I now only record the Hi-Def Broadcast channels (OTA, Over the Air) series on my new mini-PVR. The ATSC OTA content is about 6.5-7MB/Hour.  So if you do the math you can get nearly 40 hours on there. So Fox, NBC, ABC, series go on the MythTV PVR, and things I like on Discovery, or TLC, I record on the FIOS PVR.  So to get you started you need: [...] and you should download the latest windows drivers for the HVR-1950 as you will need them.  Getting the mythtv installed is pretty easy.  TO compile the driver and get it installed is not too bad either. (here is the link for the PVRUSB2 driver and instructions: [...] ).  Mile Isely (The author of the driver and all around guru) describes how to extract the firmware from the windows files since the pvrusb2 driver needs this firmware to decode the mpeg2 video. This is the hard part, but he wrote a perl script to make it easy, and he has great instructions.  But it is not for the non-technical I must admit. Here is the driver setup link ([...] Here is also a decent overview of the process from mythtv ([...]Once you get it working, you will love the extra features and power of the MythTV PVR. You can add your own content through the on screen interface, You can even use your phone, read RSS feeds, latest news.  Nice.I did see some complaints that you can't record one and watch another.That is because the HVR-1950 only has one tuner. For those that say \"\"I will get two!), the other limiting factor is the USB2.0 Bus.  If you run two simultaneously you exceed the USB 2.0 bus capacity. :(The Hauppauge HVR-1950 is a nice Tuner when you can't drop a card in the PC...\"", "\"Does exactly what I wanted it to.

The whole thing is connected to my Samsung 47\"\" LCD. I currently have the unit hooked up to cable. Recording quality is better that I expected as I also have a WinTV 150 in another PC, and the quality from the 1950 is much better. System resource usage holds at about 30% when recording. WinTV app is OK but I will be looking for something better. If you are looking for software Wikipedia has a good comparison guide.[...]\"", "I bought this to replace a tv tuner that cost half as much as this one. My hope is that the picture quality would be better. Unfortunately, its the same as the old one, they just added the external recording computer. There is nothing wrong with this item, its just not worth the extra money.", "\"I purchased a Dell XPS \"\"Red\"\" One desk top system in March 2008. Right from the beginning, the Media Center TV would not work properly. I either got a snowy or grainy picture or was unable pickup the TV tuner card. I worked with Dell who told me after numerous efforts that I was not getting enough power to tuner card. So I purchased an amplifier and got slight improvements. After numerous efforts with Dell, I was told to contact Microsoft as it could be a Media center problem caused by SP1 update to Vista Ultimate. They sent me a new copy of Vista Ultimate and I cleaned installed. You can guess, the Media center could not find the card. In November 2008, after numerous efforts by Dell to correct, they sent a technician with a new TV tuner card. Guess what....still did not find the the TV tuner when booted up. I just gave up. Three weeks ago I did a clean install again with the hope of correcting the problem. The Media Center found the TV tuner card but I still got a red grainy picture. Contacted my Cable company and they came out to check the cable. They replaced the cable from the wall to the splitter and then the two cables from the splitter leading to the modem and the PC. Guess what...still a bad picture.  He then brought in a TV and connected the from the cable from the PC  to TV and got a perfect picture. I was frustrated. He then recommended I get a USB TV Tuner and check it to see of there was a problem with the tuner and mother board. I was going to get back with Dell but chose to search out on amazon.com and came up with this unit....the Hauppauge 1192 WinTV HVR-1950 External USB HDTV Tuner/Video Recorder.  Why, if my Media center was bad or I had a bad PC lemon and Media Center did not worked, at least I could use WinTV to watch TV etc. I connected it as instructed, a very simple procedure. Loaded the drivers etc and booted up. To my amazement, it was recognized and loaded. Before I was going to load WinTv, I decided to check out the Media Center. Again to my amazement, the media Center recognized and picked up the USB Tuner....I completed all procedures and click on live TV. I was astonished as I got a crystal clear picture and my channels appeared in digital like clarity. I almost went through the ceiling with glee and joy. Everything is working perfectly for the first time in over 14 months. Yes I will contact Dell and inform them of what has happened. But I will not get rid of my Hauppauge no matter what. Do I need to go into the technical aspects of this unit, I do not think I have too. It works great. Do I need to load WinTV, I do not think I need to at this time. I will be connecting a wireless router and extender and adapter and connect to my large screen, and Blue Ray system to my PC and now use Media Center in my Living room as I always wanted. This USB Tuner sure beats PCI tuner cards (my tuner card is in my monitor). I highly recommend this unit over any other. I hope that by telling you my troubles that I had which were reconciled by the Hauppauge 1950 is a help to you. If it worked for me, it just might work for you and get you up and running like it did me. I am highly satisfied and over-joyed with the results. I think this just might be the best way to go....USB TV Tuner.\"", "The setup was simple.  There are only two things, software related, that I would like changed.  The first is the ability to save as seperate files the TV, Radio and Snapshot outputs.  The TV and Radio get saved to the same file.  The second thing is the file formats.  I would also have liked the ability to save the files in differnet formats.  This might be something that could be done in future driver updates.  My setup was from a cable box and I change channels from the cable box.", "\"This is an excellent TV adapter for linux.  This adapter's Linux Kernel driver (pvrusb2) is is rock stable and thoroughly maintained by Mike. (Edited: 2011.11.21)If you have an XvMC capable video card, you will be able to watch hi-def videos with a slower CPU as the PVRUSB2 & HVR-1950 export a MPEG2 stream.  On my 2x750 P3 box with 1G RAM, I've seen CPU resources drop as much as >70% by simply ensuring the video is being played using the XvMC feature of my (NVidia) video card.  (But, I had to convert Microsoft's test high definition wmv's to mpeg2 format... so it may seem I can play hi-def @ 30% max CPU, the video stream might have been compressed during the transcoding.)For example, I was unable to play 1080 hi-def prior to transcoding to MPEG2.  After transcoding, CPU rates is no more then 30% and playable.  The other catch, I'm not playing a stream from the HVR-1950 yet, as I'm planning to buy on within the next few weeks.Some things you may need to know:- You usually need the proprietary drivers for this feature.- The XvMC feature for accelerated MPEG2 playing might be dropped with the newer video cards.- XvMC works under MythTV.  (But has the side effect of having a greyed instead of color on screen menu.)- You can test if your system supports XvMC by grabbing standard and high definition video from the Internet.  (Microsoft has published many high definition videos in multiple resolutions.)(The purpose of this review is to advise people of the XvMC feature and the lack of mention within the HVR-1950's required system requirement postings.  MPEG2 - XvMC - video acceleration.)UPDATE!2009.05.29:  Just got my HVR-1950 yesterday and plugged it into my Linux box (after pre-installing the firmwares as instructed by the pvrusb2 Linux website) and it works as I planned with XvMC.  CPU usage for live stream playing is around 28-68% on one CPU.  Since I'm SMP, it's not a huge issue with resources.  Recording is, of course, extremely minimal cpu usage ... if any.  So if you wanted to use this device on a MythTV box as a PVR, just recording & no live stream playing with a slower CPU, you'll be just fine!(Hauppauge should be a little more specific with their h/w CPU specifications concerning \"\"recording only\"\" and optional video cards with MPEG2 acceleration (XvMC)).Funny, my hvr-1950 remote works on my Linux box too, with the exception of radio -- still needs to be fixed/enabled in the driver.  The IR rx/tx on this HVR-1950 is extremely more sensitive then the old PVRUSB2 device.  Wonderful!I chose this box over the competitor HDHomeRun because I figured USB would be more dependable then network broadcasting.  Besides, I didn't want the extra traffic on my network.  And, the pvrusb2 Linux driver has a very stable past history for 3-4 years with the developer.\"", "I still have this today.
