Seems to me they left out the tartness of raspberry altogether and bitter is an appropriate word- unfortunately the combination of bitter and sweet equals a taste that is like a nibble of unripe fruit and a packet of sweet n' low/saccharine.  The taste is that foul and bitter.  The other flavors of Celcius seem to have better reviews here on Amazon and those may be worth a try, but raspberry acai is just unfortunate.  My first thought was that that they left the \"\"ai\"\" out of the \"\"acai\"\" (sorry to be crude, but really yucko tasting stuff)...I would like to try the other flavors as they seem more promising but I think I will taste them in one can experiments from a local convenient store and make sure I like them before being left with 23 cans of doorstop.The premise- 100 calories burned per can is quite appealing.  This product is marketed as a supplement. It does contain caffeine, guarana, and taurine, and a few other ingredients in their special blend, MetaPlus.Fingers crossed that one of the other flavors tastes better, as I could also use the 3-hour extended energy boost that the cans claim.\"", "I have tried Celsius Peach Mango and Raspberry Acai.  I prefer the Raspberry Acai but both taste good.  I prefer the Peach Mango as more of a morning drink and the Raspberry Acai any time.Although it is made from green tea, and is not overloaded with sugar or artificial ingredients, I would not consider Celsius to be a health food drink.  It contain 200 mg. of caffeine.  That is double the amount for a coffee of the same 12 ounce serving.The Peach Mango flavor is sweet but light.  It has no bitterness at all.  I do not know that Celsius affects your metabolism, although many of its ingredients are considered to have a positive effect on one's metabolism.The drink is just 10 calories and is tasty, so I think its a good low calorie beverage, if nothing else.Just keep in mind, if you are looking to avoid caffeine, this drink has a lot of it..... but it is an energy drink, after all....Overall, a nice flavorful drink.", "\"First of all, let me say that I do not fit the demographic to whom Celsius is hyped...the twenty-something super jock extreme sports person. I am full-figured, approaching geezerdom, and disabled. I have also seen lots of products come and go making wild claims of various miracles. With that in mind, I approached this product a bit more critically.This product reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial, \"\"Where's the Beef?\"\" Lots of \"\"sizzle\"\" not much \"\"steak.\"\" From reading some of the other reviews, it seems some believe the acai berry benefits hype, but read on.First, they say, \"\"Perfect blended flavor of fresh-picked raspberries and acai berries.\"\" Great! I love raspberries, and acai is supposed to be the latest wonder anti-oxidant. OOPS! \"\"Flavor\"\" is the operative word here. There are no raspberries nor acai in this beverage, only \"\"natural flavors.\"\" To boldly hype acai, implying the benefits of it, but only to containing \"\"natural flavors\"\" is worth deducting 1 star.\"\"Burns up to 100 calories and more per can.\"\" First, there's the disclaimer \"\"up to.\"\" More than what? How does it burn calories? Taken as part of a diet and exercise program. Exercise! Well there's a new one. I guess the 200 mg of caffeine would give you an extra boost to allow you to work out longer, but I haven't verified that personally.Yes, Celsius cites six studies \"\"proving\"\" it works, but on closer examination, five of the six were done by the same person at the University of Oklahoma, and all were funded by Celsius. All were done using carefully screened college students in their early 20's. I don't automatically discount such studies, and they may be valid, but other independent studies would lend more credibility to their claims.OK, all that aside, how does it taste? One of first things I noticed was the artificial sweetener taste...and aftertaste. Sure enough, it contains sucralose, aka Splenda. The flavor is ok, if you like flavored ice tea. Green tea has such a mild flavor other flavors should dominate. They say, \"\"We love ginger and hope you do too!  Each Celsius is delicately balanced with a touch of spicy ginger plus all the great health benefits.\"\" While others have discerned a ginger flavor, I don't. Acai? Not sure what it tastes like, but only the raspberry really comes though...along with the aforementioned aftertraste.There is definitely a caffeine \"\"boost.\"\"Overall, there's not enough for me to like in this product for me to purchase it. My wife and others I have shared this with are similarly underwhelmed. Regular, unflavored, ice tea will continue to be my iced tea of choice. For a caffeine boost, coffee will do.\"", "The flavor of this drink is really very good - and I love that it is not carbonated.  After the first sip, I savored the tang of Ginger & raspberry mixing together.  A few of my friends compared it favorably to Red Bull - and even mentioned how they thought this drink would mix well with Vodka (something I personally wouldn't do).Each can packs 200mg of caffeine - so this should be avoided well before sleep time.", "Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea beverage is a decent- flavored beverage loaded with nutrition, with minimal calories, low sodium, and none of the bad qualities that make so many other beverages so unappealing. Oh, and one other thing: The manufacturer claims that consuming this beverage will help you burn extra calories. This product is decent in flavor, with the light taste of green tea backed with a small amount of raspberry and some medicinal properties. It is non- cabonated, smooth, and as easy to consume as a glass of water.The key difference between this and your average green tea beverage is the calorie- burning claim. The manufacturer claims that this beverage helps you burn about one- hundred calories per can and when you consider that there are only about ten calories in each serving, it would therefore mean that consuming this beverage will actually result in negative calories. This almost sounds too good to be true, but a quick examination of the ingredients makes it easier to understand why this is possible. This product contains added stimulants in the form of caffeine and taurine. These stimulants will give your metabolism a boost, and this extra metabolism will likely lead to added caloric loss. The manufacturer is cautious when it makes this claim, pointing out that results are best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. I can see how this drink could contribute to some extra caloric expenditure, due to the added boost of energy, but like the manufacturer claims, it takes more than ingesting stimulants to lose weight. You still need to control your eating habits and exercise for maximum effect.The added stimulants could discourage some people from trying this beverage, but another potential turn- off is the price. Purchasing a couple of cases of this product would be almost as expensive as buying an inexpensive piece of exercise equipment. Unless I was seriously into losing weight and wanted any little bit of help I could get, I am not so sure this product would be worth the money.Still, when all things are considered, Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea is a good beverage that is worth trying. The nutrition is much better than that found in most beverages and the taste, while it does have an artificial sweetener finish, is pleasant nonetheless. I'm a little cautious about consuming anything that contains multiple stimulants and increases my heart rate, but this is still a good product; better than the vast majority of beverages on the market and certainly worth trying if you're looking for a liquid fitness companion.", "Well, it's not magic thin juice. It specifically says, on the packaging, that just drinking Celsius will not cause weight loss. It only works when you combine it with diet and/or exercise. It says it helps you burn 100 calories per can...that's not really a whole lot. The3 Musketeers Candy Bars I shouldn't be eating have 270.I decided to substitute these for my morning latte. They have enough caffeine in them to give me my morning boost, but that's about it. Over the two week period, I didn't notice any great increase in energy, and it certainly didn't improve my metabolism enough to see any weight loss. The taste is acceptable, it's actually better than I thought it would be. I do find that I have trouble finishing the can before it gets warm, but I've always been a slow drinker.I may try using these as a mixer for adult beverages; it would save me at least 100 calories a drink if I stopped using apple pucker and sweet and sour...", "I'll admit, I had a difficult time reviewing this. The Celsius bottle boasts not only that it is a great energy/workout drink, but that it boosts your metabolism to the point where you will be able to burn about 100 calories per can. The only downside to that claim? The average person is completely unable to validate this claim. I know I'm not- I can only say what I personally felt while I was drinking it.Taste:Eh... it's ok. It isn't the best energy drink flavor I've ever had, but it isn't the worst by any stretch. The flavor I had was raspberry acai green tea. While raspberry isn't one of my favorite flavors, I do love the taste of acai. Unfortunately this is a tart drink, so if you don't like sour-ish things then you probably won't like this. I know that the first time I tasted this I wasn't that enamored of the flavor. Over time it grew on me, though.Weight loss claims:I can't verify this as far as the calorie burning goes. So forget the calorie & metabolism claims. Obviously most people won't drink this expecting it to cause them to lose weight without effort, but since I can't prove that any calories burnt would be because of this drink (& not because of diet or exercise) I'm not going to believe the claims.Energy:Energy wise though, this drink is a winner. I've drank quite a few cans of this & its given me a great supply of energy. I drank a can yesterday because I was going to be pulling a VERY late day (up for close to 24 hours) & I felt fantastic 10-20 minutes after I'd finished the drink. I've had NO jitters or heart flutters from this at all, which is a biggie for me when it comes to energy drinks. If it causes me to be jittery or have any sort of abnormal heart stuff, I won't drink it on principle. (Seriously, why would I want to continue drinking something that made me feel like that?)Overall, this is a decent product if you are looking at it from an energy drink perspective. It only has 10 calories for the entire can, plus it has a nice load of vitamins thrown into it. The only warning I'd give a perspective drinker (other than to not put a lot of weight on the metabolism claims) is that you should eat something before drinking this. Normally I don't get an upset tum from drinking energy drinks on an empty stomach, but this one gave me a bit of an upset stomach until I ate something to settle it.As long as you are looking at this from an energy drink perspective, you should be fine & be happy with the product. I don't know that I'll be buying this in bulk like I do some of my favorite tea drinks or my chocolate soy milk, but it is something that I plan on purchasing every once in a while in single cans.", "\"Celsius Calorie Burner Green Tea Raspberry is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), but it has a bitter aftertaste. We tried this after trying the very goodCelsius Calorie Burner, Cola, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), but we were sadly disappointed by this flavor.While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking \"\"too much\"\" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got \"\"jittery\"\". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.Overall, this is an effect energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder). The Orange flavor is also better tasting.Highly Recommended!CFH\"", "I ordered this on the basis of being an energy drink, not for the purported powers of the 100 calorie burn....I'm of the old school thought that if it were that easy, I would have gotten and stayed thin a long time ago without having to do it the old fashioned way by exercising every day and changing my eating habits...so, I guess you could say I am slightly skeptical on that point.Now, the taste....on first sip I wasn't floored with the taste-to me I don't taste the peach or mango, though if I just smelled the beverage I could make out.  It is not carbonated, but it tastes like green tea with a spicy ginger flavor.  If you don't like a strong ginger ale, you won't like this most likely.  After trying these for a week I started to like the taste,and started incorporating it into my liquids I drink per day (approx 72 oz. a day).  I substituted my morning 12 oz. of water I drink with my work out for one of these.  I stayed hydrated and though this drink has caffeine I didn't find that I felt jittery no matter whether I was kickboxing, salsa dancing, etc. I don't feel like grabbing one of these would make me want to run 5 miles, but I was able to power through my workout without any problem.It is hard to measure the calorie claims-I did lose a couple pounds after using for a week, but then again a person can go up or down a few pounds pretty easily, so I don't know if I can say that it is due to drinking this one can a day for a week....maybe.....but again, who knows.  All I can say about that is that I kept my normal 45 minutes to one hour workout routine all week and my eating habits stayed the same.Would I purchase?  I probably would....I like the occasional energy drink, and I grew to like this one.  It is also only 10 calories per can and is low sodium.  Would I tell others?  I already have, but only the ones that like ginger...again, that taste may be too bitter to someone that doesn't like that flavor or who appreciates a sweeter drink.  If I'm working out though, I find it easier to drink something not as sweet but that is more exciting than plain water.Overall, a pretty good product.  I wouldn't mind trying out some of the other flavors as well.", "This is a good tasting drink that tastes more like soda than a flavored tea. It uses sucralose which gives this drink the characteristic chemical-like bitter aftertaste I notice in all drinks that use artificial sweeteners. If the taste of artificial sweeteners and the possible harmful health effects from ingesting them doesn't bother you then you will enjoy this drink.", "There is a lot to like about this drink; no sugar, no Aspartame, no preservatives, NO high fructose corn syrup, it's low in sodium, and there are no artificial colors.  It does have high vitamin and mineral percentages for the RDA, which is nice.  It is also non-carbonated.  It does not say anywhere on the cardboard box (w/ a 4 pack) or on the can to shake it before drinking, but I turned it a few times before I opened it, just to make sure all of the ingredients were mixed throughout the drink.  The can is 12 ounces, which is a lot for me to drink all at once, so sometimes I just drink half and save the rest for later in the day.I don't drink coffee, so I use something like this as a way to help me wake up in the morning.  My kids have to get up and out the door before 7am, so I need the help as I am no morning person.  I usually take Zipfizz, and I take a half of a tube of that in about 7 oz. of water.  So instead of that for a few days, I drank this Celsius.  My girlfriend said that Dr. Oz talked about it on his show (love that guy!) and everybody at Costco was loading up on it.  So I was happy to try it.  I did notice that I was hungry much earlier than usual during my morning workout.  I hope this is because my metabolism was torching calories due to this drink!  Unfortunately, I will never really know.I never got a heart racing feeling from this drink, but it may affect some.  I also didn't get that crash you might get from some energy drinks, which is the best part for me.  There is caffeine in the green tea, and there is niacin, which may make some people flush (20 mcg.).  It does not state anywhere on the packaging how much caffeine there is.  As far as the flavor goes, I like this peach mango, but I also tasted the raspberry acai and I liked that one a little better.  Of course taste is just personal preference.", "We tried this, while it contains natural ingredient it does also contain 200 MG of caffeine. I was really expecting this to taste good, I love mango and peach. This tastes nothing like mango or peach (not to us) It is the most horrible tasting stuff I have ever had the opportunity to drink. I can't even describe the taste. It has guarana, green tea, ginger extract, it is to be low in sodium, no sugars, no aspartame. It does sound somewhat healthy. There is a disclaimer at the bottom stating not recommended for people that are caffeine sensitive, children under 12, women pregnant or breast feeding.I can't recommend this solely for the horrible taste it has, this is more like an energy type drink.", "My views:- The Peach Mango tastes much better if it's chilled and SHAKEN WELL before consuming.  Otherwise it's cringe-worthy.- I experimented with this product. I did the same workouts with and without drinking this prior to the start of the workout. I tried to keep the conditions of the workout the same (time of day and such).  I also wore a heart rate monitor.When I used this before working out to a Turbo Jam DVD, I found that I did work much harder and burned more calories.  There were greater than 100 calorie difference in my burn when using the Celsius as opposed to not using it in conjunction with the Turbo Jam DVD.  The results were different when I experimented on the recumbent bike.When I drank the Celsius, I worked faster in the beginning, then I eased up.  I completed 13 miles in an hour on a low intensity but fast peddle. I actually made the bike move backward a foot.  I want to add that I could easily do 12-13 miles in an hour prior to trying Celsius but have never peddled so hard that I made the bike move backward.When I attempted the same workout without the Celsius, I completed over 14 miles in an hour.  I needed to increase the intensity for the entire ride as the low intensity was too easy. I also paced my energy better. I burned over 100 more calories without the Celsius.- There was no crash with this drink.- I did not get any stomach upset, jitters or headache. My heart did not race.- I did drink 22 of the 24 cans sent to me. The other two I have been keeping at work but keep forgetting to drink.- When I did my weekly weigh in I didn't lose any more weight than I normally do on my current exercise/diet program.- Sometimes I didn't feel any energy surge at all. It was inconsistant for me.My overall opinion is inconclusive. I wouldn't buy it for the taste. It doesn't give me results I'd brag to others about. In a pinch though...if I were tired and needed some caffeine and there was no coffee or diet cola available...I might buy a single can. I don't think I'd purchase an entire case.", "\"A bit to my surprise, this turned out to be a very pleasant-tasting drink. In my experience sport drinks or energy drinks are either too overpowering in their taste, or have an unpleasant \"\"medicine\"\"-like aftertaste, especially if they are low in calories. This energy-burning drink has none of those characteristics. The taste of raspberry is very obvious, but not overpowering. The drink is not as heavy as a fruit juice though, and hence much more suitable as a light refreshment. The fact that it is not carbonated is also a plus, as it will not leave you feeling bloated. This is especially important if you are drinking it during or before a workout. I cannot ascertain how effective this drink is in terms of burning calories (they claim that one can burns up to 100 calories), but it sure did energize me and gave me an extra jolt. In that respect it is probably no better than any other caffeinated beverage. However, this drink is flavored with an artificial sweetener, which to me is not the best of an idea for a supplement that is designed to supposedly burn calories. Recent research has shown that artificial sweeteners actually have the opposite effect from the one that they are designed for - our bodies adjust to misinterpreting the sweetness to be associated with low calories, so we end up retaining more energy from \"\"regularly\"\" sweetened products.The shape of these cans is also convenient for storage or transport. I find it easier to put one of these in my bag than a regularly sized soda can.Overall, I enjoyed these drinks a lot, but I am a bit skeptical of their calorie-burning effects.\"", "\"Celsius drinks claim to be \"\"negative-caloric\"\", which is to say that you actually burn calories by drinking it.  Hmmm. . . Sound too good to be true?  Well, of course it is.  It's low-calorie because it's made with Sucralose (Splenda to the average consumer) and it promotes weight loss because its a combination stimulant (taurine) and diuretic - so basically, it works on your body like any over-the-counter diet pill.  That said, the Raspberry Acai flavor does taste pretty good, but it will be up to the individual to decide whether or not any potential benefit justifies the downside.Unlike many other reviewers, I actually liked the taste - I thought that it was a smooth blend of green tea and berry flavor.  However, there is just enough of that artificial tang at the end to tip you off that it's sweetened with Splenda.  But the absence of any fizz or overly harsh flavors made it easy to drink - which is good because it comes in full-size cans and leaves you feeling pretty full (i.e. just shy of bloated) afterward.So is it any energy drink or a diet aid?  It's a little of both.  Most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item (i.e. their secret, proprietary mix), but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious.  I found that while Celsius could beat back an afternoon energy swoon, it didn't really make me any more alert or focused - just instantly awake, albeit in semi-zombie form.  This effect came on quickly and did last for a couple of hours at least.Now for the bad news - the \"\"crash\"\" effect that a lot of these drinks try to pin on their competitors was overwhelming with Celsius.  As a little bit of background, I'm a grown adult in good health and am very caffeine-tolerant.  However, during my testing of this product, I made the mistake of drinking two cans about three hours apart and ended up unable avoid my first all-nighter since college.  I was completely awake and pretty functional throughout, although I wouldn't have operated any heavy machinery at the time.  But by the morning, I was suffering headaches, muscle twitches and even a flutter in my chest.  I'm completely sure that this was all temporary side effects of the outrageous amount of stimulants and not permanently harmful, but it was still enough to make me wary from that point on.So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking to occasionally avoid getting sleepy mid-afternoon at the office, or if you need to stay up late once in a while, Celsius may be an option for you to try.  As a prolonged weight-loss regimen, I wouldn't take on the potential health risks in order to grab at some too-good-to-be-true advertising come-on.  There's still only one way to lost weight and keep it off, and it ain't fun and it ain't quick, but it works:  eat better, eat less and exercise more!\"", "This is an energy drink disguised as a diet drink. If you burn 100 calories from drinking it, it's due to the increase in heart rate that the caffeine causes.This being said, it is delicious and pretty powerful. For those of you who want an extra kick, the 200mg of caffeine will definitely get you going. It's roughly the same caffeine as a short Starbucks drip or a Venti Mocha.Enjoy!PS Only 10 calories!", "I was excited to give these a try... They arrived nice an cold from the UPS man so I quickly popped a can open and boy was I surprised... This does not taste like Tea nor the claimed Peach or Mango... It was very sour and bitter and was not sweet at all. I guess I am a spoiled southerner with my sweet tea but I tried to drink this on 5 other occasions along with a workout to try to get a boost of energy but I just cant stomach the taste. Adding sugar or anything to try to make it taste better would go against everything that the drink stands for and then some so these are definitely a no go in my book.", "\"The can reads as a gigantic billboard of overzealous claims.  The ingredients are conspicuously lacking sugar and high fructose corn syrup (a good thing.)  The idea behind the product - a fairly natural drink packed with various herbs and such is pretty good...except for the overdose of caffeine is apparently the selling point of this product.The flavor is unbearable.  When it first hits your tongue, it tastes pretty much like a Sobe drink:  not great, but pleasantly mild in the \"\"sweet\"\" department.  Once the first gulp is swallowed...you don't want to take another swig.  It basically tastes like some kind of massively fortified energy/vitamin powder you'd buy at some vitamin shop that advertised a \"\"pleasant fruity taste,\"\" but upon actually using human senses, it's quite repulsive.  This is a bit better than the vitamin powder, but I can't imagine anyone enjoying the taste.Also, the reason it burns so many calories is likely because it's going to leave your heart thumping uncontrollably due to the incredible dose of caffeine.  Also of important note, the \"\"clinical studies\"\" that \"\"prove\"\" that this stuff works were all funded by the company.  No conflicts of interest there.Would not recommend to anyone.  Exercise will increase your metabolism without the jittery side effects (or heart attack, if you want to go that far), and if you really must use an energy drink...there are others on the market that won't have you burning calories due to the gag reflex.\"", "I am not an energy drink drinker nor am I addicted to caffeine.  The reason why I chose the Celsius drinks to review is that I feel as though I am all out of energy by around 3PM that I begin to doze off.  The added benefit of boosting my metabolism rate was also appealing.  I drinks I chose to review were the Celsius Peach Mango and theCelsius, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).Taste-wise it is so-so.  I was able to differentiate between the tastes of mango, peach, and green tea, all of which were decent.  I wasn't all that fond of the after-taste, which I was able to taste after each sip.  I don't like the taste of ginger, but could not taste it in this drink.Energy-wise, I did find that I felt a bit more energized, and was able to make it through the rest of the day without feeling sleepy.  I didn't experience any crashes.As this drink supposedly increases the metabolism rate, I weighed myself before drinking it and after.  I switched off between this Peach Mango flavor and the Raspberry Acai every day.  Without significantly changing my diet or exercise pattern, I did not notice any changes in weight.For the energy-boost alone, I would consider this drink a decent performer.  I would not purchase this for the taste or the claims of an increase in metabolism rate.", "I waited to review these until I had used the entire case so I could accurately report their effect. First of all I like the way they taste. They are very similar to all the diet green teas on the market and didn't have a chemical taste, like some energy drinks do. Compared to Red Bull, these are a taste treat! I got a great energy boost from these, but invariably I also crashed about 5 hours later. As for weight loss, I weighed the day I had my first drink and I weighed on the last day. I made absolutely zero changes to my diet or lifestyle and, not surprisingly, I didn't lose a pound. I weigh exactly the same as I did before. So, as far as weight loss goes, this is probably not a good choice. However if you are looking for a tasty, quick energy boost, these are great. Just be aware that the crash WILL come in a few hours!", "\"I was intrigued by the claim that this non-carbonated but caffeinated drink would actually burn calories although I wouldn't quite know how to really prove or disprove that it does. But I found it interesting enough to order this \"\"dietary supplement\"\", as it says on the can. At the very least I figured it would be healthy (green tea and acai) and taste great given that it contains: No sugar, no Aspartame, no preservatives, very low sodium, no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial colors or flavors.But I was in for a surprise - it tasted awful. Imagine a can of carbonated soda that was opened and then sat out on a table for a day and you get a pretty good idea of what this tastes like. Very flat and simply not good. Both my husband and I tossed it after just one sip. Even if it burned double the calories it claims to burn, I highly doubt I could down the entire 12 oz or even just a third of it. Maybe if it were carbonated that would help but honestly: Save yourself the money, this is NOT good.\"", "\"Having an energy drink that boosts your energy and burns calorie at the same time serves a double purpose. I work night shifts and do my workouts on days, after I get off from work. I drink coffee during work time but once the caffeine dies down, I drag myself to my workout, feeling tired and gloomy. The addition of the Celsius Calorie Burner in my daily routine provided me with some boost and motivation in terms of energy in my job and workouts. The 200mg of caffeine made sure I would be awake at work and the calorie burning properties of this drink made sure I would be burning more calories in my workouts. One good thing I must say about this drink is that it takes a longer time before the caffeine loses its effect because it is tea-based. Tea-based caffeine lingers much longer in your system compared to coffee or soda-based caffeine thereby giving you a much longer \"\"high\"\" on the caffeine. This \"\"high\"\" feeling is the thing that boosts your energy. Be careful though in taking this drink that has this much (200mg) caffeine in it if you have high blood pressure for caffeine increases your blood pressure significantly. After finishing the whole case of this drink, I did notice a marginal increase in my weight-loss. In my cardio workouts, I burn approximately 350-450 calories on exercise alone, not counting the time I spend lifting weights and taking this drink. The scales proved this drink worked when I lost a couple or more pounds off my target weight. The only drawback for me with this drink is the taste. Not exactly the kind of taste I'm looking for. Overall, a recommended product.\"", "I think that this product is more an energy drink than a calorie booster, but that is my opinion of the product. The taste is pretty good for one of these kind of products (I hate the taste of other similar type drinks, especially Red Bull) While it's not quite as tasty as a soft drink, it's not that bad. I did feel more alert after drinking Celsius Raspberry Acai, but not fidgety. Not a prefect product, but not a bad one either! If this pruduct does help me loose some weight, I will update my review.", "Obviously I can't attest to the calorie-burning claims of this product, but I did wonder if it would give me an energy boost to overcome that afternoon slump, but I didn't even notice that benefit.In addition, I did not like the taste AT ALL.  Even if I did see a huge energy/calorie burning benefit, I probably wouldn't drink it.The peachy mango taste is so fake and gross.I tried it cold out of the fridge and at room temperature. If I had to drink it, I'd drink it room temperature.", "When I ordered the Celsius Peach Mango drinks, I was interested in the flavor. It wasn't until after I ordered them that I realized this was a Green Tea drink, and I am not a person who enjoys tea.That said, I don't believe I've ever tried green tea before, so I figured that it would be interesting to try it, especially given the fact that green tea is supposed to be so healthy. Also, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued by the beverage's claims to boost metabolism and energy.The delivery arrived yesterday - a whole case of the drink. I promptly stuck a few in the refrigerator to chill and another in the freezer for about 45 minutes so I could enjoy one sooner.My first sip was somewhat promising - I was afraid I would find it as distasteful as I find sweet tea and hot tea, but not so. In fact, I wouldn't have realized it was a tea drink by the flavor.I continued drinking it and while it was OK, I found that continued drinking of it proved it was just too sweet for my taste. Three hours later I had only drunk half of the 12-ounce can and felt loathe to continue drinking it, so I finally poured the rest out.Not wanting to judge the beverage on just the first experience, I tried it again the next morning, with the same result, only I didn't nurse this one for three hours. I disposed of it within the first hour.I think if Celsius had put a little pineapple juice or something similar in it would cut the sweetness of the peach and mango flavors and made quite a nice flavor. As it is, I won't be drinking any more of them.I did share one with a friend who regularly drinks green tea beverages and is especially partial to anything with guarana in it (this drink includes it). He liked it well enough, but said it wasn't necessarily the best he has ever had.As for the metabolism and energy boosts that Celsius promotes, I can't adequately judge these effects myself since I didn't drink enough of it. My friend, however, said he was wired for a couple of hours after drinking the one he had. Of course he not only finished his can but drink it all within a few minutes.", "I gave this two stars because I'm taking them at their word that it burns about 100 calories per can.  Assuming it does, I can treat it like medicine and gulp it down while trying not to taste it.  Mango is a nice flavor, and sometimes peach can be OK, but mango with peach with green tea is nauseating.My advice, don't buy.  If you do, however, chug quickly!", "\"This stuff tastes.... OK.  Like a cross between diet peach iced tea and green tea.  It's almost... spicy.  Tastes kind of weird.  I don't mind it actually - it took some time to grow on me but it's all right.As for the claim on the can \"\"burn up to 100 calories and more\"\" - how does one prove that?  I certainly can't tell you if it will help me burn 100 calories.  There's no way for me to prove or disprove that statement.  By the same token - shouldn't we slap that on black coffee as well?  Certainly coffee ups your metabolism as well, right?The can is really trying to sell itself; \"\"NO Sugar\"\" \"\"No Aspartame\"\" \"\"NO Artificial Colors or Flavors\"\".  Yah but that doesn't mean it TASTES any good.I will TRY to drink this over a period of a week or so to see if there is any difference in my weight, side effects, etc.  But don't hold your breath, kids.  Just another drink claiming to help burn calories...  how can I prove that?!?\"", "\"What can I say about such a middle-of-the-road product that hasn't already been said?Does it pack a lot of caffeine? Sure, for a soft drink. 16.6 mg/oz, compared to 9.3 for Red Bull, and 10 for Monster and Rockstar. But then, an espresso from Starbucks has 75. For the \"\"you can do anything with numbers\"\" folks, Celsius has as much caffeine as about two and a half espressos.Does it have the usual blend of energy drink supplements? Absolutely. Taurine, Guarna, green tea... the same stuff everyone else has.The only places where Celsius stands out is that it tastes a bit less medicinal and sugary (a bit like Crystal Light Peach Mango with Green Tea, to me), and embarrassing \"\"BURNS CALORIES!\"\" packaging that makes it look like you bought this from an infomercial. Even from a price perspective, Celsius is right in the middle, when you consider most energy drinks around come in 8 oz. or 16 oz. cans. At 12 oz., the per-can price is almost dead center between RipIt and Full Throttle (both of which have low-calorie variants with basically the same ingredients)Unless you've tried this already and really love the taste, I wouldn't chance it on buying this. Personally, I can't imagine myself ever choosing Celsius over any other brand of energy drink when I'm at the store.\"", "Celsius is a reasonably tasty and healthy supplement drink. It claims to help the drinker burn up to 100 calories with each can by raising your metabolism for 3 hours in conjunction with excercise. I cannot vouch for that, but it seems plausible. Drinking a bottle certainly gives me a blast of energy. I become markedly more alert and energetic. Whereas sometimes I would drag at the beginning of jog, after drinking Celsius I'd be spry from the get-go. I would caution against drinking too much though. I had two cans in the space of 6 hours and I got very fluttery - almost dizzy. These cans pack some powerful stimulants, or maybe my tolerance for them is low. Anyhow, keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that Celsius is more effective if drunk 15 minutes before exercise. It might burn some extra calories if you're only sitting at a desk but I doubt you'd see any results. To lose it, you've got to move it! I consumed case of the stuff with and without exercising, and I can't say I've noticed much of a difference.As a drink, I found Celsius to be decent. Not the best thing I've ever tasted but not bad. The tea flavor is there, but the raspberry acai flavor predominates. Even that isn't overdone though. I wouldn't say it is watery but it is a lighter beverage than say pure fruit juice. One thing I didn't care for was the fact that it contains sucralose (Splenda). While I have not noticed any ill effects from consuming sucralose, others have. I'd rather not have artificially proceed sweeteners in my drinks if possible. That said, it doesn't effect the taste in a negative manner, as you can see from the photos of my co-worker in the user submitted images above.Celsius could be a good part of a diet/exercise program. It certainly is a stimulant. I felt it's effect more strongly than with5 Hour Energy, which I also like. At only 10 calories, it isn't going to hurt in any event. It's a little expensive but it is more than just a tea or soft drink so it that's understandable. If you don't mind consuming Splenda and can tolerate the stimulant ingredients, I would give it my qualified recommendation.", "\"Celsius, Green Tea Raspberry Acai is a vitamin enriched beverage that contains all of the \"\"good stuff\"\" and none of the \"\"bad stuff\"\" (No Sugar, No Aspartame, No Preservatives, No High Fructose Corn Syrup, No Artificial Colors or Flavors).  However the trade-off is simple \"\"no flavor.\"\"  This drink is very weak tasting with a tart after-taste.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste good either.  The drink does claim to burn 100 calories or more per can, and it did give me energy (I think primarily from the B6 and B12 vitamins).  I can't confirm that it actually burns calories.  However, I can say that after drinking the product for several days--I drank one can each morning--I did lose a couple of pounds, and I had no bad after effects like you can get from other energy drinks.\"", "This is an interesting energy drink, with the promise of 100+ calorie burn just by drinking it down.  Without a laboratory, I cannot vouch for this.  However, it certainly does give an energy boost, even for an avid coffee drinker like me.  And I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, it has a real ginger tang and not too sweet fruity flavor, although you can taste the artificial sweetener in it.  I did not get shaky or find my heart race after drinking this, but did feel more alert.  If you can tolerate the caffeine, it is a refreshing change from soda.", "I rec'dCelsius, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)yesterday & wanted to get the supplement facts listed in the reviews. I was curious about what this product contains, so I thought someone interested in purchasing it would be too.From the can:  No Sugar, No Benzoates, No Aspartame, No Preservatives, Very Low Sodium, No High Fructose Corn Syrup, No Artificial Colors or FlavorsFrom the pkg:  Tastes Great, Burn Calories* & Backed by Science.Multiple studies show...Celsius on average burns up to 100 calories or more per can by raising metabolism over a 3 hr period, generating increased energy.~*Celsius combines the health benefits of green tea, vitamins & more to boost your metabolism.~*And the disclaimers:~100 calories represents the average calories burned over 3 hrs. in healthy college-aged men & women consuming one 12oz.

I feel more alert & energized after drinking it. I drink a can in the afternoon & it hasn't kept me awake at night.  To test this properly, I will drink a can prior to exercise. I will update with my findings.3 stars for flavor.~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATEMay 1The first two cans of Celsius I drank made me gag. The 3rd & subsequent cans weren't as bad; although, I'm  still not crazy about the flavor. I'm thinking there might be a quality control issue. I checked the numbers on the bottom of the cans and they were identical so I'm not sure what accounted for the difference in taste...and if you're wondering, no, I didn't get used to it. Those first two cans were awful.  I haven't lost any weight using the product as instructed, but I have noticed a wonderful energy boost which lasts about 3 hours, doesn't leave me jittery & I don't crash after the 3 hr. boost.The energy boost makes my workout much easier. I'm way, way, let's say, decades older than the college students that originally tested Celsius, which might account for the fact that I haven't lost any weight using it.I'm upgrading my review from a 3 star to a 4 star rating."], "Gamma": [0.11495635658502579, 0.13978809118270874, 0.2091342806816101, 0.21377532184123993, 0.13898874819278717, 0.10421262681484222, 0.07914458215236664], "Beta":
