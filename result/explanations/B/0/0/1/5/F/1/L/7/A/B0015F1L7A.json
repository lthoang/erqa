Garmin allowed me a free update to the system (took about 2 hours to download on high speed) since I did not have the current map. As of December 2008, Garmin now provides Mac Software for updating ... a wonderful feature for us Mac users!I enjoy the fact that it determines the detail based on speed and necessity. It moves to a more detailed map when you get close, and covers 1/2 mile on highways when you don't need as great of detail.I have tested the GPS system locally in our rural area. I took some back roads to our local private lake, and all were included in the map. HOWEVER, While the system works well, the maps do NOT have the current 911 addresses in our area. Hopefully these will be included in next year's update.Things that work especially well:1) The system is sensitive enough to pick up satellites even when indoors. This allows me to set the GPS system on my console instead of up on the dashboard or window since it keeps the signal.2) When I decide not to turn where it suggests, it reroutes immediately.[SEE NOTE BELOW]3) on the 205W, the view is wide and carries good detail. It is visible both during the day and at night.4) It recharges on the USB cord (included), so when I use it without the lighter cord, I can easily recharge it.I gave it only 4 stars because of the lack of new addresses and Garmin's continuing problem with keeping POIs current. I will be using it a lot in other cities, making POI an important feature.Later Note - We used the Nuvi while traveling in Colorado (Denver) and in California. What I really appreciated was being able to download the addresses into the Nuvi directly from Google Maps. It saved a lot of time and hassle.We ran into one snag when we took a \"\"less traveled\"\" road rather than the one \"\"she\"\" wanted us to take. For 20 miles, she kept trying to get us to turn around and go back to where we departed from \"\"her\"\"route. I finally reset the location, and it worked well from there.On the way home, \"\"she\"\" also ignored this particular route, directing us to one that would have taken an additional 45 minutes. Once we were on the road, \"\"she\"\" was OK with it this time. But, I believe that I discovered the problem - the route we were taking did NOT have a speed limit set, making it automatically a \"\"less likely choice.\"\"A couple of locations it wanted to take us \"\"in a circle\"\" rather than make a left turn, or it would route us in a way that required a left turn across several lanes of traffic in 1/2 block. But hey, it's a machine.Worked well getting us to our parking location off-site from the Denver Airport, and to and from the Ontario Airport in California.\"\"She\"\" does have a rather grating personality, repeating \"\"turn left now\"\" a couple of times while we were waiting at traffic signals\"\" and we have a few nicknames for her now - one of which rhymes with witch. BUT, she got us where we were going without once getting us lost.\"", "For what it can do, it works great!Pro: Simple, large enough to be useable but out of the way. USB cable used to charge.  For how old the device is on the product line, it is still a great value. Also  very easy set up.Con: No street names said, but its accurate, just pay attention.", "Does what a basic GPS is supposed to do. Gets you from point A to point B with a minimum of trouble. For approx $80, can't beat this!", "\"[UPDATE 6/25/2011] I found a GPS I actually like! It's theGarmin nuvi 1690 4.3-Inch Portable Bluetooth Navigator with Google Local Search & Real-Time Traffic Alerts. My review is now there -- maybe I can get in the top reviews again... If you can't find it, comment here.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have owned a Garmin c320 for a few years now and was looking for some new features, like coordinates and altitude.  I first bought the TomTom 330 XL, which was a disaster.  After lots of research, I bought this and kept it.  Here is my long list of pros and cons:PROS:1. Best routes.  (See my cons)  This may be one of the main reasons Garmin dominates in the US -- good routing.  Of course, I wish it had more a brain and could think about traffic lights and general traffic in certain areas at certain times (not actual traffic reporting), but I guess needing brains is good.2. Where Am I?  (See my cons) This will list your nearest street address.  In this screen it also shows altitude and your coordinates.3. Easier broad map access.  On my c320, you had to dig in the menus to find a broad map view, so you could touch areas on the map and go to it.  On the 205w, you can just touch the map while driving and it will take you to the broad map.  You can then touch an area that you want to make a Via Point and change your route that way.4. Speed Limit sign.  You can set it up to show the current speed limit on the screen.  It has been super accurate to the instant of a speed limit change in real driving.  If the sign is missing on the screen, you also then know that it doesn't really know how to calculate arrival time from the road.  You may want to use that information to take or avoid that road on your next trip.5. Very compact.  My c320 was much bigger, so this is super small.CONS:1. Touchscreen.  This may change as I use it, but the touchscreen is no where near as sensitive as my c320.  It requires some hard touching.  It also shows fingerprints much worse than my old GPS unit.2. Ball mount.  This gives a better range of motion than the mount on my c320, but it feels like I need to push really hard on my GPS unit to get it to snap in.  This may change in age, too.3. Keyboard speed.  When I'm typing in a city, street, etc., the keyboard is a full QWERY keyboard, which is an improvement over my c320 (I think you can choose ABC keyboard), but there are two things I don't like: 1) there is a delay from when you type to when it shows, so if you type fast, you can't see what you're typing, if you make a mistake, you don't see if very fast; 2)the spacebar is tiny and way off to the right, while dumb menus are in the bottom middle -- very annoying!!4. Charging cord.  On my c320, the charging cord would plug into the mount and there wasn't a charge jack in the GPS unit itself.  This was nice because you could leave the power cord in the mount all the time and take the GPS with you - you never had to plug in, just clip the GPS in and out.  Now, the power cord won't stay put and it falls out the door, etc. because it must be plugged into the back of the GPS.  I suppose with the mount the way it is, it's not possible to have a jack in the mount and GPS, but I think they should work on that.5. Current road.  The TomTom XL 330 did show what road you are currently on and what the next road to turn onto was.  Garmin only shows the next road name.6. Routing pet peeve.  Sometimes I won't want to take its routing because I know of a better way.  Let's say I turn off of the normal route -- it will recalculate and have a shorter time than before I turned.  What's up with that?  Why didn't it take me that way to begin with?6. Routing choices.  I don't like the fact that I can choose either Fastest Time or Shortest Route.  I would imagine that some of the time, the best route would be in between those to extremes.7. Missing POIs.  There are just so many cases where I'll be looking for something and it's not in the Garmin -- even for stores and restaurants open for years.  I know you'll have this will all GPS units, but for the #1 seller in the US, can't they figure out a way to get the users involved?  How about incentives for users to fix problems online and give them discounts on map updates?  If you have the best maps and POIs by far, why would anyone buy any other company?8. Tinny speaker.  I'm not impressed with the speaker, it is much worse sounding than the deep c320, but you can hear it.  It's just not pleasant.9. Voice choices.  It would be nice to choose your voice, but I don't see that option, unless you choose another language.10. Nearest intersection.  This is within the \"\"Where Am I\"\" place in the menu.  It could be very useful in an emergency to have the nearest intersection in addition to the nearest address.  However, I've found that they should have labeled it, \"\"random intersection within a few miles.\"\"  It will generally show me a major intersection, and sometimes ignore dozens of closer small intersections that would be much more beneficial to the police, fire, ambulance, etc.11.  Volume.  I hate how they have the volume setup.  On the c320 there was a wheel on the side of the unit -- that's best.  On the TomTom, there was a place on the main driving screen that you touched and then moved the volume slider.  On this 205W, you must hit Menu, Volume, move it, then back, then View Map.  This is just awful.  I want a Mute button on the driving screen and a separate volume button there, too.  This is widescreen after all.  I hope this doesn't cause accidents, because I think it will.  When I answer my phone, I want fast access to mute!12. Need customization!  Let me choose 3 shortcut buttons for the driving map view.  That way I can put Where Am I, Volume, and POI on the main screen.  Please!!  I also want to change my route color to red instead of light purple.13. POI choices.  This is something I've never found a GPS that does this how I want it.  If I'm looking for gas or food, it is usually on a long trip.  If I want to go to fast food, let's say (that wouldn't happen!), I would choose Restaurant, Fast Food.  It will show me all the restaurants by how far they are from me now.  That's not what I want, so I choose Near...My Current Route.  That's closer to what I want, but it still shows how far it is from where I am now.  I want it to show me that, but also how far I'd have to deviate from my route.[UPDATE 6/5/09] 14. Battery life.  The battery life is just awful in my unit.  It might last a few hours, and if it is sitting idle for a couple weeks, it's almost dead.  My c320's battery was far superior.  It has been this way since it was new.  I suppose mine could be defective..Overall, this is an excellent unit and I would buy it again because I believe the Pros outweigh the Cons and no competitor has yet beat it.[UPDATE 3/18/10] I'm still using this and it's working well, except for the battery life.  I did find that you can add the EcoRoute features if you upgrade your firmware from Garmin's website.  Sorry, I can't post instructions, but the feature is very cool.  You add your car's miles per gallon and the current gas price and it tells you how much it will cost to get to your destination, along with other features.\"", "\"I will give some comparison for those who were also considering the earlier units, especially the 7x0 models.The 2x5 units have a faster processor, and the routing and menus are noticeably snappier.  The display is also cleaner and shows the MPH on the main screen.Compared to the relatively mature 760, it is MUCH more stable probably due to the less (gimmicky) features.  As others have commented, the touch screen is not as good as the older 7x0 models and takes a more definite press.  Also, the display is not as bright, and the voice prompts get distorted when turned up loud.The big killer of the deal for me was that this uses a much different (probably cheaper) GPS receiver chipset.  The 7x0 and a very old GPS that I have typically get signals in 1/2 minute or so which is about all I have the patience for when going somewhere.  This one often took several minutes before prompting that it just couldn't locate the GPS satellites.  Sometimes, after a few tries (and probably 5 minutes), I would give up waiting pulled over on the side of the road.  There is an option to just do a simulation where it \"\"drives\"\" for you and shows the route, but that defeats the purpose of a GPS.One final but major irritation is that when it routes you a sub-optimal way, there is no way to tell it to include a certain freeway or road.  There is an option to add a way-point that is an intersection, but the majority of times, it would go something like this:  a) enter the city, it finds it OK, press next, b) enter the freeway, it finds it OK, press next, c) enter the exit street name, it finds it OK, press next, and d) it says it's invalid!  This happens time and time again.  I found the only way to work around this is to cancel navigation, go into map view mode, scroll around, study and learn the area and find some other local intersection that hopefully would be valid.  Then, go back in, and use that intersection.  Of course, then it navigates you off the freeway to this other way-point which is obviously not a suitable workaround.I do give it two stars because of the price, and it is a step in the right direction, but I was sorely disappointed with this highly-rated item.\"", "What a disappointment.  In many attempts, this Garmin 205W could only rarely acquire a GPS signal, only to lose it quickly.  Eventually it lost this ability entirely.  During these attempts, the unit would often lockup with a broken-looking screen display.  Then, it could not be turned off!  Attempting to turn it off resulted in a white, lit screen which persisted until the battery ran down. The reviews are so good that I am returning it to Amazon and will try again, but a what a Christmas Day disappointment!", "This Garmin GPS is the first to come into my family.  I've found this device to be easy to use, even for my less tech savvy father.  The screen is large and brightly colored and the directions are easy to understand.  The different formats the directions are offered is a plus (ie: full map/audio directions, part map/part written direction). The only problem I have had is that it can't find certain places I search for.  This might be because we're too far away at the time or the store/street is listed differently in the device than what I am typing in, but I thought I'd mention it here.  Overall, I really do enjoy what this device can do.", "Purchased this for my wife whose car does not have a GPS.  After using she wanted one which gave turn voice directions so we gave this one to grandchild and bought another garmin.", "This is my everyday GPS and it does the job very well, sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes to get the sattelite when I go to another country, but other than that I recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple tu use GPS...And its Garmin, I've been using Garmin products all the way back since the StreetPilots and I can assure you that theres nothing better than this...Soon I'll be retiring this and getting one of the new 5&#34; ones...", "Love it, much easier to see than the 3.5 inch GPS it replaced.  Needs stronger suction cup.  Great for failing eyesight.", "Garmin n&uuml;vi 205W 4.3 - Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator excellent product I've enjoyed on trips tells you where all", "\"The Good:  Good routes, clear voice, plenty of volume, and accurate maps.The Bad:  No external volume control, POI database fairly small, no text to speech, and map colors seem a bit kindergartenish.Overall:  The Garmin Nuvi 205w is a solid entry level unit for basic navigation needs.  If you're looking for extras, this isn't the place to find them.  Below you will find my detailed, usage based review.SETUP:  Your overall comfort level with technology and electronics really drives how important this aspect a device is because you should only perform it infrequently if more than once.  Fortunately for the Nuvi 205w, there isn't really anything to do.  Other than product registration and charging, the unit is ready to use out of the box.  While some may change a few of the settings, most will have no problem going with the defaults.DISPLAY:  This is an area where the published information doesn't tell the correct story.  The difference between the W and non-W units is more than just 3.5\"\" (Nuvi 205) vs. 4.3\"\" (Nuvi 205w).  The Nuvi 205 is correctly labeled as being QVGA (320x240) resolution.  However the Nuvi 205w is incorrectly labeled as WQVGA which would be (480x240).  If this were the case, the only difference you would notice is that you have a larger area displayed at the same resolution.  In reality, the Nuvi 205w has a resolution of (480x272) which is actually Sixteenth HD1080.  So why do you care?  Those extra 32 pixels give you a crisper display on the w units.SOUND:  When choosing which unit to buy, I went to a local retailer to compare units.  I ran the same simulations on a Nuvi 205 and a 255w.  I already described the difference in display above.  When I compared the sound, I was disappointed that the text to speech on the 255w lacked the clarity of the basic instructions on the 205.  I decided to opt for clearer, but simpler guidance.  I've used both types in other GPS units, and I find that the clarity in verbal prompts is more helpful that spoken street names.  On the 205w, the next turn is listed at the top of the unit, and you can watch for it along your route.  This is also an area of cost consideration as the difference in base price between the 205w and 255w is $70.  I just didn't think it was worth it.  The one feature I would like to have seen is an external volume control on the unit.  If you decide to adjust the volume, you have to press the menu button and choose the volume icon on the main screen.  However once you have a good volume, you probably won't be making many adjustments since this unit has neither an MP3 player nor Bluetooth capabilities.NAVIGATION:  The sound and display don't mean a lot if the unit doesn't get the directions correct.  I tested my 205w in areas that I drive frequently to see how it would do in generating routes.  Of the five different trips I tested, each was at least 10 miles.  The routes the 205w generated were essentially the ones that I would choose, and I had direction prompts before I could place the unit in the windshield mount.  I intentionally missed a few turns or turned early to force a route recalculation.  I found that the process was quick, and it was able to get me back on route quickly.  The only area where the unit did not excel was differentiating between a highway and the access road.  I have had more sensitive units that would enter route recalculation before I made it to the stoplight at the end of the exit ramp.  The 205w did not notice that I was off route until I turned on the street at the end of the ramp.  This is a fairly contrived test so you can decide if you think it is important for your usage.USABILITY:  This is an area where the Nuvi 205w gets high marks.  The user interface is very easy to work with.  One other reason to splurge for the w model is to have the QWERTY keyboard layout.  For some reason, the non-w units only have alphabetical order layouts which I find very unintuitive.  Menu navigation and data entry are a snap.  The only thing I would change is the color coding on the maps.  It seems that they tried to use all the colors from a box of crayons with all of the street color coding.  This gives the maps the appearance of something out of a kindergarten coloring book.  I have to admit that this is pretty minor, but I would have liked something a little more grown up such as the Navigon color schemes.EXTRAS:  There's not a lot to comment on here.  The 205w has a photo viewer, and you can navigate to a picture that is tagged with coordinates.  Frankly, I would have rather seen this feature left off and saved a few more dollars on the base cost.  The maps only take up about half of the internal memory so the need for an SD card reader would not exist without the photo features.It is pure novelty, but I did like the ability to add additional vehicles and voices from the Garmin web site.  I added a few vehicles and the Halloween voice.  I found the voice amusing, but it annoyed my wife.  If you connect the 205w to your PC, the web site can install them directly to the unit.The 205w does not ship with a USB cable, but most people already have more of these than they know what to do with.  If you have a digital camera or non-iPod MP3 player, you probably already have what you need.  The car charging cable that ships with the unit is very stiff, and I found that I had to maneuver it more than I would have liked in order to run it from the unit to the power jack without creating an obstruction to my instrument and windshield view.\"", "I got this for my son for Christmas. He travels all over the Phoenix area doing construction work. It gets him where he needs to be faster without driving all over. It saves time and gas for his vehicle. He had borrowed mine which is about 3 years old and loved it so much that he really didn't want to give it back when I needed it for a trip. So I got him one.", "I have had this unit for about 8 months. It has given me no problems what so ever. The bad thing about it for me is how basic it is. If you want bluetooth compatibility, traffic updates, movie times, etc on your GPS, then this is not the device for you. But if all you want is to get around and find places, then this unit will work well.The price seems a little high right now for what it does ($180). For that price I would expect bluetooth compatibility. This unit does not say the road names, it just says turn left or turn right in 200 feet(not a big deal). When you look places up, it has their phone number and address (usually) which is nice because if its late at night, you can call first to see if they are still open.This GPS has an SD card reader on the side, which can be used to view pictures in slideshow mode when you don't need the unit for navigation.The screen is very bright during the day, so you can easily see the screen. And a nice feature is that when it gets dark, the screen automatically changes colors to 'night' mode, which helps when driving at night (the screen dims and the bright white background colors change to dark blues and blacks).The trip features are nice. It keeps track of your average speed, how long you spent moving, how long you spent stopped, total travel time, how many miles you've gone, etc.It takes about a minute to a minute and a half to find your location from a cold start, but if you leave it powered all the time (with a car in which the cig lighter stays on when you turn the car off) it never loses the location (not sure if that is bad for it).The battery life is very good (about 4-5 hours).There are many add-ons that a technologically advanced person can add to it. Such as custom points of interest (you can download them or even make your own, and you can set alerts so that it warns you when you are close to a certain place or when you are speeding in a school zone). You can add different vehicle icons to use as the car on the screen.Overall, it is a decent, but very basic navigation device. Not many bells or whistles, but it gets you from point A to point B well.", "I purchaed this unit just before Christmas, got it right away.  I was very happy since I had a lot of traveling to do.  Got me lost 3 times. Kept taking me in the opposite direction. Couldn't take me out of my own neighborhood. When I tried to return it (after 2 weeks)to a dealer on Amazon he ignored me. I had to go through Amazon and they promised to take care of it, they would have done a good job but they sent the answer to the wrong address. Meantime I waited (to be nice) then called, I finally got the return Number and sent the unit back.Wait again and then I got an email through the site sying that it is too late to get my money back.  WOW, now they have my money and they have my unit.!"], "Gamma": [0.01970837265253067, 0.019710028544068336, 0.019924268126487732, 0.037942543625831604, 0.019710028544068336, 0.019721761345863342,
