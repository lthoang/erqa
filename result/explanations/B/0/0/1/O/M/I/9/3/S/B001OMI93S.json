"], "reviews": ["I'm in my late 20's, with fair freckled skin. I have just started noticing fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes, so I thought some more moisture might rehydrate my skin, therefore minimizing the fine lines.After a few nights of use, I already notice that instead of feeling dry and very non-perky in the morning, my skin is much more...plump and alive! and I don't think plumpness is wanted anywhere except in the texture and feel of your skin. ;-) Much better then sagging and sallow.This has a light fragrance, like jasmine, which I do like. Obviously, those with sensitive skin sometimes have a be careful and will mostly shy away from fragranced products. I myself am a big fan of curel and use it from head to toe. I like its texture and that it doesn't break me out. So far, this neutrogena night cream is working out well for me, both as night and day cream, especially during the winter here in New England. It works under makeup, not greasy and is immediately absorbed by my skin. Hopefully it will continue to be a benefit for my skin in the long term, and I will update as time passes.pros:- makes your skin very soft and hydrated- non-comedogenic(won't clog pores)- can be used under makeup- smells great- contains Tocopheryl acetate, also known as vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E in particular is used to combat aging.- good texture, with almost a gel like quality to it, so it feels light on the skin despite being a night cream. Very soothing.cons:- the packaging. While nice looking, we all know sticking our fingers repeatedly into something isn't ideal. Be sure to wash hands well before using, to keep it as germ free as possible. Would have preferred it in a tube or pump form.- contains parabens, which are usually ingredients I try to lean away from, but really, sometimes it's necessary. Parabens are generally known as chemicals used as preservative in anything from creams to shampoos. chemicals = not earth friendly.What it contains for those who are very picky or interested about what's in it:Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Trisiloxane, C12 15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyrospermum Parkii Extract (Shea Butter), Behenyl Alcohol, PEG 12 Glyceryl Dimyristate, Chrysanthemum Parthenium Extract (Feverfew), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyl Dimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate 60, Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Glucoside, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Beta Glucan, Disodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance", "I'm skeptical of claims by cosmetics companies, but I do like Neutrogena products as a rule. I can't say this product makes me look significantly younger, but I didn't expect that. It does, however, feel really good, and it makes my skin look smooth in the morning. This moisturizer is more of a lotion than a cream, so a little goes a long way. That's a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't feel greasy going on my face. It's absorbed quickly and doesn't stain my pillow. It's lightly scented - I don't even notice the scent. It feels really good after I have put it on, and I don't wake up with a compelling urge to wash the stuff off of my face. My face looks smooth and feels soft in the morning. This moisturizer does not have SPF, so it would not be appropriate as a day cream. I don't know that this product is any better than night creams by the major cosmetics companies like Lancome and Estee Lauder, but I'd be willing to bet it's a lot less expensive. I think I'll keep using this. It feels good and works well.", "\"I have dry and very sensitive skin, and not many skin creams work for me; Neutrogena's Continuous Hydration Ageless Essentials is a good match for my skin, but not for night use. I would need something much heavier to last the night. It is great for daytime, excellent under makeup, and seems to visibly smooth out my skin and leave it with a nice feel.The consistency is very light and almost has a \"\"whipped\"\" look to it, and the first time I slathered it on my face and neck it was absorbed in seconds. The second (or even third) coat seems to be necessary for me, in order to last through several hours of wear. It has a pleasant aroma, and I especially love it on my neck and upper chest area, which soaks it up like a sponge.Well worth having if you like to vary your face creams and try something new, but don't expect it to be a thick night cream. Light and lovely it is, for thirsty skin in a world where your skin, because of pollution, etc. needs constant tender loving care.\"", "I have utterly baffling skin -- crazy oily in some parts, irritatingly dry in others. So I'm always in search of a nice moisturizer that won't make me break out. The Neutrogena Ageless Essentials has been working great for me. My dry patches have pretty much disappeared, and I haven't had any trouble with breakouts at all. I highly recommend it to anyone with combination skin who's been having issues with finding a good moisturizer.This definitely is a nighttime moisturizer; I think it would be a little too heavy and too slippery to wear under makeup, and it also doesn't have an SPF, as a daytime moisturizer should", "If you've tried to find a moisturizing cream designed with anti-aging qualities in mind, you may have found that green tea extract is in nearly every one of them. I know this because my mother is allergic to green tea and we've been unable to find her a nightly moisturizer...until now.Ageless Essentials by Neutrogena isn't greasy, which I love. You're not smearing this stuff all over your pillow at night and wondering how much Spray n' Wash will it take to get it off the pillow in the wash the next morning.Glycerin and shea butter keep the consistency of this cream smooth, and makes it so a little goes a long way. Don't make the mistake of using too much and this small jar will last you a long time.The claim that there are 'time-released' moisturizers may be a bit of a stretch, as if you wash your face before you put this cream on at night, you probably have moisture on your skin and this simply locks it in.The scent is light and fresh (chrysanthemum), and should not clash with any perfume you may choose to wear. I use a light application around my eyes prior to putting on my mineral makeup and it seems to smooth out the fine lines.Overall, I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it.", "This cream is a delight to use.There is no heavy or greasy feel to this cream. That is reason number one for loving it. You can sleep with it on and not feel weighed down as it is so light.Over the course over several days, I could feel and see a significant improvement in the dewy moisture of my skin.This wonderful face cream applies silky smooth.It works for twelve hours, over-night, so you can apply it before bedtime knowing that it is hydrating your skin as you sleep.I am very impressed with this moisturizer.I will definitely purchase it and the price is quite reasonable.Definitely a cream that I would recommend and purchase myself.", "A luxurious treat.. was a soft pleasant surprise to apply this... its gentle and no loud fragrance smell that argues with your chosen perfume.", "NOT fragrance free.  There is a strong perfume.  Why, oh why.  Also, it's light purple. Why.IMHO, the light night cream is a superior product. It is truly fragrance free and absorbs better. And it's cheaper.", "This product provided long-lasting moisture to my skin just as promised.I used it first as a night moisturizer as described.  It went on feeling much lighter and fluffier than I expected for a nighttime moisturizer.  Many moisturizers billed as nighttime moisturizers are heavy and oily feeling - but this one definitely is not.  If I have any complaint it is that the smell is a bit flowery and I personally prefer a lightly scented to unscented moisturizer for night. Given the dry cold winter, I woke up with my skin feeling nice and moisturized.After using it a nights a couple of days, I decided to try it as a daytime moisturizer given the fact that I sometimes struggle to find a daytime moisturizer with staying power, especially given the extremely dry winters that I have to survive.  It worked well at maintaining throughout the day and provided an extremely smooth foundation for my make.I recommend this as a multipurpose moisturizer for day or night - particularly for those living in dry climates.", "My biggest concern, as with any night time moisturizer, is that this would cause pimples. It didn't, and for that I am dearly grateful. It does a good job of moisturizing, soaks in well and doesn't leave a greasy feeling.", "\"I am a big fan of Neutrogena products.  They are always effective, never clog pores, have light scents, and are priced reasonably.  But this particular product is not one of my favorites.This is billed as a \"\"night\"\" moisturizer, but it's not what I would expect from an overnight treatment.  Since it comes in a jar, I expected this to be a fairly thick super-moisturizing cream.  It's actually a light lotion.  As a light lotion, it works well.  It goes on smoothly, provides instant moisturization, absorbs quickly, and has a very light pleasant scent.  It's pretty similar to my usual Olay Complete that I use daily, and seems to last about as long.  The Neutrogena packaging states that it can be used under makeup, so I guess they don't only intend for it to be \"\"night\"\" cream, but it doesn't have the SPF that I require in a day lotion.  So this product doesn't meet my expectations for a heavier overnight cream, and I wouldn't choose it for my daily moisturizer either.\"", "My skin has dried out over the years. What used to work on my skin does not anymore. I have been searching for a night cream and tried Neutrogena Ageless Essentials and it works great. Non-greasy and moisturizes very well. My skin is a lot less dry all day than it has been. The jar lasts for several weeks. The price is very good as well.I highly recommend it!", "\"Having used this for a few days, the product does what it says on the packing, to a degree.Although I am not sure if it will actually \"\"fight the source of aging\"\", my skin did feel smoother and I was able to apply makeup within a minute applying the cream.  I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer wasn't quite enough as a night moisurizer, but it seemed perfect as a non-greasy day cream. Perhaps in the summer when it's more humid it would be better. The cream also passed the \"\"rub test\"\" and did not rub off into flakes unlike other creams with lots of fillers that create smooth-looking skin by filling in lines.My dislikes are:* Scent - slightly too strong and quite sweet smelling, reminiscent of Sweet Tarts.* No tamperproof packaging.\"", "I'm in my late twenties and have very sensitive, dry and acne prone skin so I was very skeptical in receiving this lotion.  I was worried that it would irritate my skin or would cause breakouts.  I also rely on my lotion to minimize the itching associated with dry skin and was worried that this lotion would not combat this.  However, because I already have fine lines around my mouth and along my forehead I was hopeful this product would help minimize these imperfections.At first I was not crazy about this lotion.  I experienced some stinging, especially when using this after an exfoliating scrub.  I also noticed that the lotion wasn't hydrating enough to eliminate my persistently itchy skin, especially around the sides of my nose and hairline.After a couple of weeks of use, however, it was as if my skin got used to the lotion and was able to reap it's full benefits.  The stinging went away and the lotion did a much better job at combatting itchy skin and flaking.  I had to reapply the lotion several times throughout the day to maintain the moisture, but I was getting results much closer to lotions I had previously used.I think the biggest change I have noticed was when I ran out of the lotion and had to switch to something else.  Instantly my skin started looking duller and returned to being flakey and itchy.  I'm already missing the hydrated skin I had while using this product.The bottom line is that after giving my skin some time to get used to this product it did a great job of moisturizing my dry and flakey skin.  However, I'm still not convinced of its 'fine line reducing claims.'  After a little over a month of usage I didn't see any notable differences.  However, given how well it moisturized it's possible I would have noticed something after several months of use.  In conclusion, this product moisturizes well, but don't expect dramatic wrinkle minimization.As a follow up: I'm using this product again and my skin is back to being smooth, soft, and subtle.  Even though my fine lines are still noticable I'm loving how soft this leaves my skin and how easy it makes applying my makeup.", "I really like this moisturizer. My 34-year old skin suffers from dryness and tightness, especially around the cheek area. This product helps ease the dryness and balances my skin beautifully. The texture of this white cream is light and creamy, and not at all greasy. It absorbs into the face and neck quickly and leaves behind no residue. It feels comparable to a luxury moisturizer.I find that it works well on all areas of my face and is gentle enough to use around the eye area too. The container is easy to use and has a sturdy twist-off lid. I love it and I would definitely buy it again. Im also confident it is light enough to use in warmer weather.", "I've been usingNeutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer, 1.7-Ounce Jarsfor about 3 weeks now and it has really turned my skin around from being rough and overly dry to feeling soft again. Although being in the northwest you'd think we would have plenty of moisture to prevent dry skin, but every winter I face the same problem. By February I have small dry patches on my face that really bother me and quite often slathering on lotion just causes my skin to break out.I stated using this product after washing my face at night and just applying enough to cover without excess. It has a nice light smell that didn't bother me or my boyfriend once in bed. In the morning my face feels soft, not oily which is great.I originally thought the price was high, but after 3 weeks I still have at least half a jar and better skin so I'd say the price is very reasonable.", "This is a lovely product. It's much lighter than I typically think of a night cream, but I've found I prefer a quick-absorbing cream to the typical greasy night cream. I use it by day as well (though would probably switch to something in their line intended for day, w/ SPF, for summer). It's light without being full of air, and sucks right into your skin and leaves it feeling supple & hydrated all day, but still feeling really nice and clean. Because it soaks right in, you can apply powder almost immediately. I don't usually wear makeup, but I have dry skin, so I really need to moisturize if I want to wear that mineral stuff. I'm always running late, so I like that I don't have to wait around (which I did with the moisturizer that actually came with the makeup) if I want to wear makeup. I'll definitely buy this again.", "Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer is a nice, light, pleasant-scent moisturizer. To me, it isn't enough for a nighttime cream. At night, I like a cream that really saturates my face, leaving it feeling softer in the morning.  This product is just right for daytime use and for under make-up.It isn't greasy but it does moisturize. I recommend it for a day-time moisturizer or if you don't have dry skin and don't need much moisturizer at night. It did not clog my pores and it feels good on.", "I have been using this lotion for a little over a week.  I have some super dry, sensitive combination skin.  This lotion stings a bit on contact.  Could be the added perfume, I'm not sure.It does, however, keep my face pretty evenly moisturized, looking sort of fresh in the morning.  If they can do it without the sting I'd probably keep using it.The consistency is creamy, not a thick cream, a little lighter than that.  It does smell, not bad, but there is a distinct odor there.", "Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer is a very good, light, creamy, non-greasy moisturizer. It has a pleasant smell, and doesn't irritate my wife's sensitive skin or clog pores. After a couple of weeks use, she says her skin feels softer and wouldn't hesitate to use it on a regular basis.", "\"I've always been a fan of Neutrogena products. It says a lot that these inexpensive moisturizers are approved and recommended by dermatologists ... including my own. Even the most sensitive skin seems to flourish under Neutrogena's care ...Now, as someone who uses Renova, I need a no-frills nighttime moisturizer to layer over this (potentially) drying product. And, admittedly, it is difficult to find a product without AHAs, grape-seed, CoQ10, etc... (which can be irritating when combined with Renova). So, I usually use CeraVue (which is VERY basic and effective). Nontheless, CeraVue is a bit on the \"\"thin\"\" side and I would like something slightly thicker for night. Neutrogena's Ageless Moisturizer has the thick consistency that CeraVue lacks and delivers a generous shot of moisture. It genuinely plumps dry skin! (Which is a temporary effect, of course, but it also keeps my skin from peeling as a result of the Renova).My only concern: the jar's design. No matter how clean your hands seem, germs are inevitable. I (usually) avoid any product in a jar, because about half-way through the product, it tends to be significantly contaminated. This, of course, can lead to contact dermatitis and a number of other problems. If Neutrogena Ageless Moisturizer were available in a tube, I would be much happier (because there are a number of ways to avoid contact with the actual bottle-tip.)Even with its \"\"delivery flaw,\"\" I highly recommended this moisturizer ... especially to those who use strong retinoids,  Kudos to Neutrogena for another great product!\"", "This is a very nice night time moisturizer, with a very soothing scent.  It feels very nice, and my skin feels nice the next morning as well!", "\"I have combination skin that was oily in my younger years, but we all need a good moisturizer as we reach \"\"a certain age.\"\"  It sounds weird, but with my skin type, I like a night moisturizer that makes my face look rather \"\"greasy\"\" when I wake up in the morning, and this product fits the bill for me.This lightweight lotion had more sticking power than I expected when I first used it, and my skin had absorbed enough in the 10 minutes before bed that the lotion didn't end up on the pillowcase.  Though I am cautious of added fragrances (which are so often used to mask unpleasant chemical smells), I didn't mind this light scent.  I would recommend this lightweight night moisturizer for those who don't need the power-punch of a cream but want extra hydration to start each new morning with a rejuvenated face.\"", "This arrived just as I was beginning to phase out my heavier winter cream. After cleansing, my face usually begins to tighten and I need to moisturize at once. Upon opening the jar of this moisturizer, I noticed the texture seemed rather runny and I was skeptical of whether it would be up to the job. But yes! The hydration actually seems to improve after a few minutes.As the weather warms, I find this cream is most suitable for summer weather.Some may object to the fragrance of the product. Fragrances are not an issue for me, but may be for others. Just a note of caution. Also, the texture seems more suited for a pump; I worry that if the jar were tipped or dropped, product would spill everywhere.Despite these small drawbacks, I did like it and would purchase again.", "I've been using various creams, night & day, for quite some time.  I've never noticed any dramatic results with any of them.  This one is no different.  Having an extremely sensitive sniffer, the fragrance of this cream is a too much for me to tolerate.  The cream itself is on the liquidy side, which is a plus compared to some other creams on the market.  All in all, I suppose using this cream would be a benefit over using nothing at all, but due to the fragrance, I'm passing on any future use.", "\"Quite obviously, I'm more than delighted with the price not only in these rather trying times but also considering the astronomical sums other companies are asking for a product that is advertised as doing very much the same thing.Speaking of advertising, do not know how in the world anyone could respond to Neutrogena's claim of \"\"Continuous Hydration.\"\"  What I can attest to is that it does indeed soften skin and  it  still feels soft and supple in the morning.  Hopefully, my skin remains healthy but I cannot speak to whether or not this product has had anything to do with that.As far as I can see there's been no discernable diminishing of those telltale lines that visit all of us.Bottom line is I find it to be a good product for the price, several claims made by the manufacturer  aside.\"", "This moisturizer has a rather strong but pleasant odor and is non-greasy. It did make my skin feel smoother but I didn't feel it was enough to moisturize my skin. I would recommend applying it more than once a day. It's about on-par with the other age defying creams or anti-wrinkle creams one would find on the shelves.", "\"I actually use this for both day and night use.  It has a very nice fragrance, it's very smooth and not the least bit \"\"sticky\"\".  It's a very nice moisturizer.  FYI, I have quite sensitive skin, and some Neutrogena products burn my skin.  With this moisturizer it \"\"tingles\"\" slightly right when I put it on, but it's not uncomfortable, and goes away quickly.\"", "\"The name of the product is pretty captivating, Ageless Essentials. Most people would like to look a little younger and I'm no different.I don't think it will do much for my deeper wrinkles, but it reads that it \"\"significantly smoothes the appearance of fine lines\"\" and I hope it does. Two nights application isn't enough time for me to determine if that's true.It does have a light perfumed scent, but that fades away quickly after applying it. Still I think it would be nicer without any scent. That's just my own opinion though.\"", "I'm in my mid 30's with combination skin which is quick to break out if something in a product disagees with it. I used to use Neutrogena products extensively about 6 years ago and was very happy with them, then when pregnant I was having a lot of issues with my complexion and my mother recommend Olay. I started using Olay which worked wonderfully and have continued for the past 5 years post baby as well. Noticing my face is often quite dry in the morning (winter months) I decided to give this product a try.I'm not impressed with the packaging as I prefer a pump so I don't have to put my fingers into the entire product, that said it absorbed quickly and the odor wasn't offensive, my face felt velvety smooth and not greasy at all which I appreciated. In the morning it still seemed well hydrated though a tad greasy requiring a good morning cleansing (I'll admit I often skip a morning wash when using my normal Olay 7x at night before bed) I did notice a bit of increased acne the few days I tried this though it might have been a hormonal influence and not based on the moisturizer.All in all it works well for its intended purpose but not any better then what I've been using Olay Total Effects 7x Visible Anti-Aging Vitamin Complex Fragrance Free 50ml/1.7oz. It did however reintroduce me to Neutrogena products and I picked up their Healthy Defense SPF 45 sunblockNeutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, SPF-45, 1.7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)which I adore and even have my husband using during the day!", "This face cream is actually quite lovely. When I first used it I was concerned that it felt a bit greasy but after it soaked into my skin (which was very fast) it didn't feel greasy at all. Not sure how they accomplished that, but I was happy about it. There is a slight scent to the cream, which probably won't bother most people, but I do have allergies to scents, so I don't use it every night. Other than that, I would highly recommend.", "Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer is a timed-release non-greasy moisturizing cream.  It is intended to be used at night, though  I find it to be relatively light and suitable for daytime usage as well.The scent of the product is pleasantly feminine and typical of other moisturizing agents in its genre.  The cream goes on smooth and absorbs relatively quickly, although this may vary depending on your particular skin type.In general, this product seems to work just as well as the higher priced alternatives.  It is quite hydrating and seems to be effective at combatting dry skin conditions.  As a person with sensitive skin, this product did not bother me at all.
