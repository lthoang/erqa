The unit itself is nice and thin, and has a sleek design. It has decent connectivity, however, there are a few obvious shortcomings. The first is that there is only one analog audio input, even though there are component, composite, and S-Video inputs. What were they thinking? The next is that the DVDO EDGE GREEN doesn't have the front HDMI input like the original has, with only 5 HDMI inputs on the back. While 5 HDMI inputs it probably about 3 more than the average user needs, the average use isn't buying a DVDO EDGE GREEN. Because of the type of enthusiast who is buying something like this, this thing should have 4 analog audio inputs, and at least 8 HDMI inputs plus one on the front.In terms of actually using this, there are ups and downs. I haven't tried the automatic switching, but that is an option. Manually switching inputs is easy. However, configuring the device is easy but annoying. The menus look like something out of 1995, and while they are fairly easy to navigate, they are click-heavy in a Nokia sense, with a really cheesy remote to be click-heavy on. The unit also does not have an Ethernet port, so if you have to update the firmware, you have to get a laptop, and update it through USB. It's the only new device in my HT that doesn't update itself without plugging in more cabling and using a laptop, either through Ethernet, or in the case of the Comcast box, through the cable system.The one major hitch that I have had with this is that it has a serious firmware bug so that it cannot support N64 or other older consoles that output in a 240p format. I have contacted DVDO about when they are going to fix this serious bug, but I haven't heard back yet. This is a pretty major flaw for a device that is marketed to up-convert SD sources, including gaming. If DVDO isn't going to fix this problem, I may end up having to re-cable some of my HT to connect the N64 directly to the TV.Lastly, this device does help with upscaling, but it is not magic. It won't turn a crappy source into a good one, and that includes Comcast's over-compressed HD cable. It's the best on the market, but there's only so much you can do with low-quality (Comcast), or low-resolution (Wii) signals.", "\"The DVDO Edge Green is one really high end video processor. Unlike most HDMI switches, this also supports analog devices as well. It's a power house for cleaning up noise in your analog sources. It even has DVDO's exclusive \"\"progressive reprocessing\"\" technology which will fix badly processed video sources from devices like DVD and Blu-ray players. It even helps repair issues with sound to lips moving in video (my biggest pet-peeve, when audio and video don't match up).Problems with video scaling? Tired of the black bars on the sides of your screen depending on what's on the TV? No problem, this processor even matches up the resolution of your HDTV and the source  of the signal (resolution can be set individually for each type of source). With it's massive number of inputs, including 5 HDMI ports and 4 analog ports, this hub will allow you to pair just about any audio with any video to your HDTV. It's more than just a HDMI switch for adding more ports to your TV. It's an all-in-one device that lets you pair everything together into one main hub, then sends the signal via HDMI right to your TV. It's one awesome HD video processor!\"", "I bought my DVDO through Amazon from J. Mac Supply. The cost with shipping was $402.00. I set it up on the original 1.00 firmware, and this product worked perfectly. I own some very high end equipment. Including an LG 60 inch Plasma, an Lg BD-570 Blu-ray Player and a new Sony wifi 3D blu-ray player. I also still have a Toshiba A-2 1080p HD DVD player and about 150 HD Movies. The first thing I want to say is I was reluctant to download the latest firmware version 1.5 because this product worked so well out of the box, but after reading the improvements in the firmware, I downloaded it. It was a simple process. On my Windows 7 laptop, I went to Anchor Bay's website, downloaded the 1.5 zip file. I created a DVDO file and unzipped the download, and moved the 1.5.abt file to my DVDO file. I then plugged in a mini USB cable from my laptop, and took a paper clip and held in the reset button on the DVDO. The DVDO came up on my desktop as a mass storage device. I deleted the 1.00.abt file from the DVDO, and moved the 1.5.abt file I downloaded to the DVDO. When I unplugged the USB cable the firmware flawlessly uploaded and added so many features, they were too numerous to mention. I also liked the fact that before you download the firmware, Anchor Bay asks you what other features you would like added to the DVDO. This product and new firmware works flawlessly, and added many more features in the line of picture control and automatic switching. I also did away with my optical connection to my Yamaha 7.1 receiver, and went straight HDMI. I did not know until I bought the DVDO, that if you use only the coaxial or optical connection to a 7.1 receiver, you only get 5.1 surround. Now going through the HDMI, I am getting both 6.1 DTS and 7.1 surround, and the speakers I connected for that are all working now. (WHAT A DIFFERENCE). Now back to the DVDO. This machine is awesome, and I do not care how expensive your equipment is, you need this machine, because it will make anything better and up convert any signal to 1080p 24HZ output to the display provided your display will reproduce that signal. Because I have the 60 inch plasma, I absolutely hate watching blu-rays or HD DVDs with those ugly black bars, and most blu-ray players have no zoom feature. The DVDO flawlessly removes these bars distortion free, and cleans up noise and lip sync problems, along with a full spectrum of controls for brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and many others. This product will make any input signal better, including blu-ray. There was even a slight improvement in the HD DVDs which in my opinion are still a much better format that blu-ray. HD DVD was proven, and blu-ray even this many years into production are still having load and freeze problems. But I guess that was a money deal with Sony, and Toshiba did win the VHS Beta war years ago, so I guess it was Sony's turn. But I know this, when both formats were available, I always chose HD DVD over blu-ray. What a shame the market wouldn't allow both and we got stuck with blu-ray which is still having format problems. Oh well.In short, if you have high end or any type of 1080p TV, the DVDO is a must addition for any home theater. If you don't have one, get one. You will not be disappointed.UPDATE: Since my purchase of this in November 2010, this unit started on an LG 60 inch plasma, then to a Mitsubishi 73 inch dlp and now to a Sharp 80 inch led, and everything is still working flawlessly.  Additionally, this unit makes it great when you buy a new TV, because the only connection I have to make is plug the tv in and swap the HDMI cable. If this unit fails, I wont hassle fixing it. I will just buy another one, because it is worth all of the extras it provides.I liked my first on so well, I ordered another.  The DVDO Edge Green seems to work as good as the Anchor Bay model, and maybe better, because the menu items that will not work with the display it is attached to, will be greyed out.  I like that function.  The automatic switching seems to work better on this model too.  All in all, this is a great product that should also be sold in high end electronics stores and I do not know why it is not.  If you are into high end stuff, this product is a must for perfection.  I have this one connected to my new Sharp 80 inch LED TV, and I love the help it gives to the picture quality.  Oh, by the way, I went to EBAY and bought another Original DVDO Remote for $32.00, because although adequate, the remote that comes with the Edge Green is horrible, slow, and must almost be in front of the Edge Green to work. If you buy one, I suggest you check EBAY for the original Anchor Bay DVDO Remote. It is worth the extra money.  I also contacted DVDO and Ken Nguyen is still there and explained the greyed out menu areas, meaning if your display will not do deep color to 36 bit, this function will be greyed out so as to not up set the performance of the display. Their service is great too.Dale", "If you are anal about your picture quality, then this device is for you.  It definitely helps clean up the picture and makes things sharper.  I am running this with Verizon Fios, PS3, and a Samsung 55 inch LED 1080p.  Before I used this device, I thought my picture quality was already excellent, but then I plugged this in and instantly noticed better results.  Things just looked sharper.  Especially when playing Call of Duty MW3.  I think it made more of a difference when playing videos and games on my PS3 then on the Verizon Fios box.  My wife doesn't see a difference, but I think it looks sharper.  I don't have any type of tools to test the results except my own eyes.The device is nice and slim, and is perfect if you have a lot of hdmi devices you need to plug in and don't have enough wires running through the walls.  The remote control feels cheap, but then again, you won't really be using the remote much except for switching ports, and making adjustments.I believe Edge Green is the lower line in DVDO's product line up.  When I first picked it, I thought the Green in the title stood for something Eco Friendly.I'm going to invest in a better home theater set up in the near future and hopefully when I have everything together, I will then be able to get the full potential out of this device.  If you are a videophille, AV junkie, you are probably going to want one.The main question you have to ask yourself is if you can live with the picture you have, or are you willing to shell out some cash to improve it?", "The DVDO Edge Green High-Def Video Processor provides a large bevy of processing and filtering settings for your video needs.  There are a good selection of inputs and outputs and some great features that I didn't expect.  The lack of motion processing is unfortunate as that is one of my major gripes with many LCD TV's.  Overall, it's a competent attractive unit.==Build==There are plenty of inputs to connect all of my devices, but some people may be disappointed with only 1x yellow composite video and 1x s-video inputs.  DVI and VGA inputs would have been nice and a USB port would have been impressive.  There is only one output for video (HDMI), but another HDMI output sits next to it for audio and there is an optical audio output as well.  The unit feels very solid, and the case is uniquely designed with a sharp angled cutaway on the front.  The remote looks and feels cheap, but it's simple enough to use and works fine.  Also, I dropped the unit onto the carpeted floor from about 4 feet up and it's no worse for wear.  The size of the unit is large enough to take up some decent real estate in your cabinet and despite it's short stature, it's probably not wise to stack it.==Features==The remote makes it very easy to switch inputs or aspect ratios on the fly.  You can sort the priority of inputs so that you won't constantly need to switch manually though, which is great.  There are a ton of filters you can use, like noise reduction and all the standard video settings like brightness, contrast, etc.  By far the most impressive feature for me was the inclusion of calibration test patterns.  Having calibrated 2 HDTV's I own using an EyeOne Display2 laboriously going back and forth between the TV, computer and Blu-Ray player (or USB port), I can see how much a blessing this device could be for videophiles.  Thanks to this device, I thought I'd be able to calibrate my LG 42LV4400, but one of the two devices wouldn't cooperate and I could only get a error on my TV saying the format was incorrect despite trying several formats.  Both devices worked fine otherwise.==Conclusion==This DVDO Edge Video Processor is a great addition to any videophiles home theater hub.  While I expect many home theater enthusiasts would have an AV receiver capable of this level of video processing, those with expensive, but outdated receivers would do well to keep their old equipment and add this device rather than shelling out much more to get a high-end modern receiver.  The video upscaling from standard definition signals should be a noticeable improvement if you aren't already running your video through a video processor.", "I was surprised at some of the improvements that this product made to the quality of my video inputs.  Even my HD satellite TV image via HDMI seemed to improve.  The upscaling worked very well with lower quality inputs.  The image coming from my laptop via HDMI also looked great.Setup is easy, and the menu system is very easy to navigate and understand.  The priority video switching is awesome, so when I turn on my PS3, it automatically switches to that signal and when I turn it off, it goes back to TV.Now for a few criticisms.  There is priority video switching, but apparently no priority AUDIO switching.  It will not detect when an RCA audio-only input has sound coming in to it.  So if I start to play audio using myLogitech Wireless Speaker Adapter for Bluetooth Audio Devicesfrom my phones or tablets (connected to this box via RCA cables), the box will not automatically switch inputs when it detects the sound.  I sent an e-mail to the company to ask them if I was missing something or if my assessment was true and they never responded.  Also, the remote requires you to point directly at the box.  And I do mean DIRECTLY.  I tried replacing the batteries in the remote but there was no difference.This product is a nice solution if you don't already have an A/V receiver that has all of the features that this product has.", "This little guy is a must for anyone working in the video industry. It has all the connectivity and ports you need to convert your old or new interviews/videos to be able to be ready to be viewed online + it definitely is not a power hog.", "I'm not an A/V geek and I didn't know quite what to expect with the DVDO Edge Green.  I wasn't expecting to actually notice a different in picture quality between this and just connecting my equipment directly to the TV.I don't use a receiver, so I wasn't sure how well this item would work.  My set up includes a Panasonic 3D capable plasma (don't own the necessary glasses), PS3, xbox 360, and an AT&T; Uverse box.  Connecting everything to the DVDO was very simple.  It was just a matter of plugging in all my HDMI cables and turning on the devices.Simply put, I was shocked that the picture looked a lot more vivid than it did before the DVDO.  I had spent a copious amount of time messing with my TV settings to get the picture to look the best it could.  The end result was that it looked nice, but lacked a vividness I prefer.  The DVDO brought out that vividness.The DVDO offers a wide range of settings, but it's smart enough to select what it thinks are the best settings.  These pre-sets work well for me and I haven't changed any of them, although I have played with them a little to make sure I was getting the best picture possible.Switching between devices is very simple with the remote provided.  Each input has a dedicated button, so you don't have to flip through an on screen menu to switch between devices.The DVDO does a good job with a variety of resolutions.  It makes standard definition TV look better than normal and HD look more beautiful than usual.The device runs cool too.  After having it on for several hours, I touched it to see if it emits a lot of heat and it felt cool to the touch.Overall, I am very satisfied with the DVDO Edge Green.  I was surprised by just how much it improved my already nice picture.  I highly recommend this item for anyone who wants to eke out an improved picture.", "\"Lets open with the usual - if you are reading this review, you are clearly looking for a solution to a problem armed with some basic AV knowledge, because nobody stumbles upon an HD processor and upscaler by mistake.The DVDO EDGE Green is built around the same core found inside units that cost at least twice this much - so right off the bat, you have a fantastic option if you'd rather not spend $1000 on be your gear. The \"\"Green\"\" portion will either impress you, or leave you cold, but knowing you have a product that is designed to sip less power should be an option everyone considers - especially if you have a large rack of gear, every watt saved will help (and reduce heat).As I mentioned in the opener - there should be no need to explain what this box does, but if you need the help, all you need to know is that it takes a non-HD signal and uses \"\"magic\"\" to improve the quality before sending it to an HD TV. Not every video source out there is HD nowadays, and you could have a signal from a Wii, DVD player or other SD device. Send it into the DVDO EDGE Green, and the end result is a massive improvement. No real magic involved of course, this is all built into the brains of the Silicon Image chipset inside the box. The end result is really quite good - and a variety of filters and other options make sure your HD signal looks as good as it can get. Other features include the ability to sync video and audio as there may be a very slight delay in processing the video that puts the two out of sync, making all your content look like a bad Kung Fu movie.The back of the box is full of inputs, and you can feed it signals from just about any plug you'll find in your AV lineup. Outputs go to HDMI and HDMI with audio only (perfect for feeding a receiver).The remote is a bit of a disaster, and at this price the box really does deserve better, but once setup, you'll rarely need it, plus most setups above \"\"amateur\"\" most likely have their own universal remote. Yes, the Harmony line of remotes has the codes for DVDO built in.So, is this the best video processor on the market? Probably not, but it definitely is the best in this price range, and if you know what you are looking for, you really can't go wrong with it.Cables in the box - power and USB, so be prepared to order your own cables.\"", "\"I was given this item as part of my participation in the Vine Program in exchange for my review of the product. After a couple weeks of learning about this processor and days of dragging my a/v equipment all over my house here is my review:The DVDO Edge Green is a High-Definition Video Processor. This item also serves to take all those connections on the back of your tv and simplify them into one HDMI cable for the TV, and one for your A/V set. Setup is rather straightforward. Take all your devices, clear room for a DVDO (the length of a large cable box), and start plugging them in. Whatever you plug in now gets processed by this unit and in a better quality.I have a PS3, Wii and Scientific Atlanta cable box. My TV is a 9 month old 37 inch LG HDTV. All units play nice with the DVDO except for the cable box when connected with an HDMI cable. Then I get a grey blinking screen which says the format is not accepted. When (drug upstairs and another mess later) plugged into my 42 inch Samsung plasma TV, everybody plays nicely and I can use the HDMI from the 8300 to the DVDO Edge.The biggest shock was upgrading my ps3 with the box, then HDMI cables came the next day because I couldn't live with myself for allowing those standard cables now that I had the Edge. Being given this for \"\"free\"\" has delightfully incurred a few costs here and there so I can appropriately evaluate the product. Anyway, back to the PS3. The PS3 home screen was stunning. All those little glittering confetti graphics were sparkling and the depth of colors on the screen were much nicer. My DH was very pleased with the quality it produced and thus used it as an excuse :) to play a few games. This box lets you decide the input priority, screen ratio, and many indepth video settings I am just beginning to learn about. Also has a game mode which gives a faster response.This is an entry level processor at a fair price. I am giving it 4 stars because it does deliver on quality. I would have liked to seen a couple more inputs for rca cables, I know that sounds silly but since it functions as a hub I feel that would have been beneficial for people who have some older systems they want to connect, too. I still have a PS2, ya know! These aren't dealbreakers by any means. The remote is kind of ho-hum and my DVDO did not come with any directions, nor cables. For the price tossing just one or two cables in the box would have been a kind gesture.Overall I think this is a good buy. The small drawbacks are just that - minute. My cable looks better and my PS3 rocks. I will update after I hook up my new a/v reciever.ETA - OK, so I finally got my LG and DVDO to agree on a S-Video cable and a digital audio coaxial cable for the sound. This freed up that one stereo input for my Wii and made me a LOT happier. Still, a note to those at DVDO - slap in another set of stereo inputs on the next model, OK? :)I will update when I get my Sony a/v reciever..just had to go out and get a new one since this puppy has HDMI audio out.\""], "Gamma": [0.10764073580503464, 0.10764073580503464, 0.10764073580503464, 0.02497580461204052, 0.10764073580503464, 0.007429335732012987, 0.10764073580503464, 0.10646890103816986, 0.10764073580503464, 0.10764073580503464, 0.10764073580503464], "Beta": [[0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.00012383188004605472, 0.034894708544015884, 0.000899650389328599, 0.08813951164484024, 0.019941456615924835, 0.044280823320150375, 0.003011853899806738, 0.06643995642662048, 0.7253375053405762, 0.016930678859353065], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.0007346206693910062, 0.03834041953086853, 0.0008084210567176342, 0.08679573237895966, 0.02227267622947693, 0.04842262715101242, 0.003946787677705288, 0.06921903043985367, 0.7010665535926819, 0.02839314006268978], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.000584846013225615, 0.03346085548400879, 0.0006422903388738632, 0.07855630666017532, 0.018891289830207825, 0.04189927875995636, 0.0032305147033184767, 0.06109338998794556, 0.7366715669631958, 0.02496965415775776], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916], [0.0005851972382515669, 0.03343959525227547, 0.0006414715899154544, 0.07851653546094894, 0.018876424059271812, 0.04186924546957016, 0.003228012938052416, 0.06105337664484978, 0.7368251085281372, 0.02496505342423916]]}
