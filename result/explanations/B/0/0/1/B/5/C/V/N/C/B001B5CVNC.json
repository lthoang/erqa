I definitely would not have paid upwards of 20 dollars or more for it, but maybe 5-10$. I plugged in it for about 1/2 hour, the camera got hot and it seemed temperamental in the charge(the red charging light would go in and out). Also, a little challenging to plug in given the nature of the USB popping out of the camera. Works fine using it with a powerstrip so you can set the camera on the solid ground.It will be useful in a pinch if I have no other option, but I'm definitely going to stick to mostly charging thru my computer just to be safe.", "[I don't know if it was intended to be this way, but this is textbook nickel and diming the valued customer. The Flip camcorder comes without a charger and the proprietary charger (this one) comes without a charging cord.]I thought I'd get the charger for my Flip MinoHD because its non-removable battery can only be charged through a computer USB port OR the Flip's own adapter and I CAN imagine instances where I don't want to carry a laptop around so that I could charge a pocket-sized camcorder. I also did not like the way the MinoHD plugs into the laptop and hangs there, charging for hours, suspended by the USB arm.Well... $24.95 later (that's what I paid at the Flip site) it turns out that there's just 'one more thing' needed to make this work the way I want it to. I couldn't imagine it possible and I didn't check before ordering but the charger came WITHOUT a cord so the MinoHD has to hang off the charger by its USB arm again while the charger itself plugs into the wall outlet (weird).I really wish the Flips were compatible with standard chargers. The way they are now, while allowing us to take good videos on the cheap, they also complicate life more than they should. It's one star because I don't like its design/ergonomics, I don't like the concept of asking the customer to spend more on a NEEDED wire and because I'm returning it.________________________________Note:I found that theUSB Travel Charger for SanDisk Sansa Clip/ Sansa Fuze/Sansa View/Sansa e200is perfect at charging my MinoHD and almost a steal, pricewise. You will need a cord, unless you want your MinoHD hanging off its USB charging arm while charging.", "Definitely worth purchasing because without a PC or laptop around, you can't recharge your FLIP Cam without this. Also gives the cam a full charge in much less time than plugging into laptop via USB.", "I realized soon after getting my flip HD that I can find so much to shoot that I burn up a battery pack and need to recharge it and that sometimes it's most convenient to recharge it via a wall outlet rather than a computer. Here are some examples,,,We went on a week long cruise and I had no computer access but I could recharge with this because there were electrical outlets everywhere.I was shooting a wedding reception for a friend and forgot to recharge  before leaving but by the time the wedding was over I grabbed my fully charged unit where I plugged it into the church wall behind a table and I was ready to shoot the full reception without losing any power.We went to Myrtle Beach and stayed in a friend's condo. No computer there to recharge but I just popped in my camcorder at night before going to sleep and it was always ready to shoot in the morning.I have even found outlets at the airport (near soda fountains and vending machines) in a pinch.Don't get me wrong, it's not that my camera runs out of juice easily, it is, instead, that the cameras owner forgets to recharge it as often as I should.Negatives: Wish this was made so I could just stick my spare battery pack into it rather than having to plug the actual camcorder into it but I suppose most don't have spare battery packs so that is no big deal. However it would be nice if it somehow left open the option to do both so that I could keep shooting while it chargesit is really lightweight and has,so far, worked perfectly for me.", "Cannot get any easier. Just plug the Flip into the power adapter and plug the adapter into an electrical socket. Voila! Charging begins.", "Although I think Flip should actually include something like this with the camera when you buy it, this product is absolutely essential if you have a Flip camera. My Flip's battery runs out pretty quickly, and I do not want to drag my laptop around with me everywhere I have my camera. So this small charger meets the need perfectly. I am a little uneasy with the camera hanging from the bottom of the charger, but it has not slipped out yet. This was the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.", "The connector's compact size is a plus but you might run into trouble charging your Flip from a wall socket.The two-prong folding connector works on standard 120v. The Flip connects to the bottom of the charger, which has a light that indicates it is charging. The connector works best with a power strip on a tabletop, so the camcorder's weight isn't hanging from the connector. According to the manual, the connector provides a full charge our Flip UltraHD in 3.5 hours and that matches our experience.Amazon's special holiday offer included two accessories with the purchase of aFlip UltraHD Camcorder, so I chose this charger and theFlip Tripod for Flip Ultra and Mino Camcorders. I purchased this as my wife's Christmas present but it never made it under the tree. She loves the Flip UltraHD.It would be better if the prongs pointed in more than one direction. This is a simple, easy-to-carry option when you don't want to use your computer's USB port to recharge the Flip.Rating: Four stars.", "It is always nice to have an external adapter for charging electronic devices. In the event the adapter fails, you simply replace it instead of the entire electronic device.In the case of this adapter, Flip missed the mark a bit. In my house, the receptacles are on the wall, not the floor. So, if you plug the camera into the adapter and hang the assembly from the wall receptacle, strain is placed on the USB connection. Not a good idea. Fortunately, I happened to have an extension cable (USB).Flip, add a cable to the adapter, please.Additionally, the prongs fold into the adapter to make it easier to transport. Great idea. I like it. However, I would recommend that anyone with long fingernails not attempt opening the prongs from their closed position; you're likely to break a nail.Flip, how about a spring loaded prong or, at least, one that is a bit looser to aid in opening?", "This power adapter is great for charging the Flip Video camera when not in use.  I use this on a regular basis.", "I bought this as a gift for someone else. I have not heard any bad things about it, so I guess it is doing whatever it is supposed to do. I think it should have been included in the original package with the camera and I should not have ha to buy it in the first place.", "What do you want to know?  Works fine and you don't have to use your computer to charge it.  No problems even in 220voltage areas.", "This was a gift for my wife so I don't have first hand knowledge of how well it irks but when something doesn't I hear about it and I've not run into that with this.  She uses it all the time and it is really convenient.", "\"This thing was built dumb.  How can you see how far charged the HD (2nd gen) is?  By looking at the screen.  Where does the screen face when charging?  The wall.  Fantastic engineering.  Just like when the camera is plugged into your computer, the screen faces away from you, so you can't see any visuals or messages on it, and when it's unplugged they go away.  The solution is charging on an extension cord, which should not be necessary.  Flip could have engineered the charger, at least, so that the USB input was turned over and the camera's screen faced out.  You know, sometimes you don't have a lot of time but just want to get a little charge in the camera and need to see what it has - because, and here's another case of fantastic engineering, the Flip Ultra HD doesn't have any kind of battery display UNTIL the battery is running low.And this is besides the \"\"too hot\"\" problems.  Are there solutions for this?  What a joke.\"", "Adapters are a must nowadays with many products.  This was bought to go along with the Flip Video camera that I bought for someone.  They have no complaints about it.", "I got this charger with a promotion with my Flip Ultra HD.  Even though this charger was designed for the Mino, I got it because it looked like it would be more useful than the other free accessories.  Because the Flip Ultra HD's USB port comes out from the side rather than the top, I use an extension USB cable is it isn't hanging from its side. I've only used this a couple times to charge my Flip and it seems to work well. I haven't experienced any over heating, perhaps that is only and issue for the Mino. This charger didn't cost me anything so in that respect its worth it for me. I can also use it to charge other electronics.  But if you're unable to get it for free than I suggest buying a third party charger which should work just as well if not better.", "A necessary power adapter for the Flip camera. Bought this along with the various cables as well as the Flip camera. All in all, a good purchase. No issues.", "I bought this over a year ago. It's been in use ever since with a third-generation Flip Mino HD. The adapter is essntially a universal USB charger matched to the power requirements of the Flip camcorders. I thought this migh be an appropriate time to offer up a review.But I checked out the other reviews first. Boy, this charger doesn't get much respect, does it? Let me take in turn sme of the key criticisms I've heard:1. The charger isn't compatible with third-generation Flips. Our Flip is third-generation. We have no difficulty getting the charger to work.2. The charger causes Flips to overheat. Maybe, but we haven't seen that in a year's use.3. Users should just swap in a new set of batteries rather than recharging. Some Flips don't use batteries that can be swapped out. The Mino HD is one of those.4. It's better to charge through a USB port on, for instance, a laptop. Have you ever wanted to go to DisneyWorld with your camcorder but without your laptop? We have. A charger like this is needed in travel or field conditions when you might not have a laptop to fall back on.5. If you're in an airport, the charger requires you to leave your camcorder dangling from an airport outlet where someone might swipe it. OK, this is true. But I don't see how the charger can be blamed for this.We really haven't had any problems using this charger. However, I prefer not to connect the Flip's swing out USB arm directly to the charger. This is awkward at best. We use a USB extension cable instead.So long as you pay no more than $12-13, this is a decent buy.", "\"I have had no problems with charging though it seems to take a little longer than they claim.  I rate it 4 cause the way you have to literally \"\"hang\"\" the flip from the charging port!  While it charges, I keep wondering when that flip will fall off so bought a union cable allowing me to keep the flipsafely on my desk while it charges!\"", "Works just like any standard USB charger...after a while mine doesnt work anymore. Unfortunately Cisco discontinued the production of Flup video because of the quality of videos now available in smart phones...was a solid camera though", "It's simple easy to use and makes it easy to charge without a computer.
