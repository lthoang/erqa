This makes it a great buy for what the Aspire One can do.  However, there are some small problems:1. In white, it's too pretty.  Using mine in a Hot Spot Cafe makes me look like an old gay guy.2. The keyboard is too small for me to touch type.3. The Touchpad is too difficult for me to efficiently control the pointer.4. After downloading all the upgrades and patches, etc., I was left with only 3.6GB of hard drive.Okay, now I will tell you how I overcame these problems:1. I ignore the first problem.  I'm 70.  Why should I care.2. I type slower and more carefully to solve the 2nd problem.  Actually, I do most of my real work at home on a standard keyboard.  In a Hot Spot I am either shopping at nearby Sears or Circuit City and Goggling for competitive prices on line, or I'm using the Aspire One to read email or entertain myself or others.3. To solve the pointer problem I downloaded the driver for my Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks.  The download for Apple computers works fine.  Downloading from a Hot Spot is much faster than downloading on my desktop computer - which is connected via 56K modem.  I live close to a Hot Spot so I can use their unsecured Internet connection for free.  Private files are kept only on my desktop computer.4. I purchased the 8GB HDHC memory module to solve the HD shortcomings.  Installation requires only plugging it in and updating the BIOS - both of which are simple.  This gives all the memory I need, but a 16GB HDMC is also available.  And with no private information on the hard drive, I can go on line without any special security programs which take up space and slow processing while on the Internet.  I can just use the recovery disk if files on the hard drive are corrupted by a virus or whatever.All the features and programs have been very well thought out for popular use.  It is lite and can go anywhere.  It uses very little electricity so it doesn't get very hot - like my full size laptop does.  The Operating System, Linux, is very simple and almost completely intuitive to use.  THIS IS A VERY USEFUL LITTLE COMPUTER AT A VERY LOW PRICE.  In fact, if I didn't have very large photo, music, and so many other files, it would be my favorite.", "My Acer Aspire One Linus died after one week, leaving only a blank, black screen upon startup, with no abiity to move my cursor.  From searching the net I found that this is not an isolated instance.  There appears to be a complicated procedure that would possibly revive my machine, although it might have the effect of terminating my warranty.Returned it for a refund from Amazon.  Amazon was fine.  Product was second rate.", "Many of the reviews here are not for the AA1 XP version - they are for the Linux version with SSD which runs quiet.My XP AA1 in blue color just came in yesterday - and I am able to hear the high pitched fan whine across the room [(google - aspire one fan noise) and check out the appropriate forums]. It seems that all the XP AA1's are faced with this problem. After a while, this UMPC gives  me a headache from the noise. This problem is so big - I have to take away two stars from what is otherwise an exceptional product. This noise is not from the HDD - it is fan noise. I verified that much.Some observations -1) Very prone to fingerprints (blue model).2)CPU usage is around 50 percent playing back Xvid encodes. 720p WMVHD encodes are gorgeous and playback smooth as butter. 1080p encodes - don't even try.3) I have tweaked XP a bit - boots in under a minute. Removed fancy but useless XP features. Font is now more readable and the interface is windows classic. Pretty fast after the minor tweaks.4) Screen is good but reflective. I prefer non-reflective screens.5) Very light.6) Fits in my wife's handbag - imagine her shock to find a computer in there. Well - she thought it was  DVD player since my lousy Toshiba portable died after just a year.7) Webcam's pretty good. I was having problem with Skype - need to investigate that further. CPU usage with Skype was also around 50 percent.8) Plenty of RAM and CPU - for all common tasks.9) Touchpad buttons are very stiff. The right touch pad button is located below the touchpad level (Manufacturing defect).10) Keyboard is quite good. No problem touch typing away.12) Battery life appeared to be good from the factory charged battery (2+ hrs). My unit was made 0808 - maybe 2 weeks  back!13) Sound is a bit low volume but better fidelity than expected.14) 100 GB available HDD space(I guess 15 GB is in a hidden partition for acer system restore functionality). The HDD is made by Hitachi. I have not had good experience with Hitachi HDD's in the past. Keep my fingers crossed on this one.15) Almost the same size as my Toshiba portable DVD player - just thinner and much lighter.16) Has two SD card slots. One takes in the card fully - use it as another drive. Boot from it too - like Linux. Exceptional feature. Neat!17) WiFi worked in a snap. WiFi crashes if the machine is woken up from sleep about 2 - 3 times.18) Intel has or is going to have a more advanced chipset specific to the UMPC (4500 instead of 950) to go with the Atom CPU. Keep this in mind. However, I was fine with the 950 capabilites (I don't intend to use mine for entertainment - even though it seems to work fine in this area).Update - Skype full screen video (using built in webcam) works fine. Ohter side reported clear picture and sound. Approx 50 - 60% CPU usage.I may have to return mine because of the noise issue :(. I so like this thing - but imagine listening to a high pitched wheee for hrs at a time. No thanks - I'd rather save my sanity.2nd Update - The killer whine has now gone down in intensity. It is still bothersome, but not something that will give me a headache. I am mighty puzzled.Any questions - let me know.", "\"Recently there has been a small revolution in computing of sorts... the \"\"netbook\"\" or 'mini laptop'. What is a netbook? Well, they are tiny laptops that are in a new class of their own. Up until recently, the smallest class of laptops were defined as the \"\"ultra-light\"\" or \"\"super ultra-light\"\". These laptops usually had 12 inch screens and weighed around 3 pounds. Many of these ultra-lights did not have DVD or CD drives, but relied on \"\"media docks\"\" for these capabilities.The new kids on the block \"\"netbooks\"\" are even smaller... having screens roughly 9 to 10 inches and weighing around 2 pounds. Many have hard drives that are flash based... also called solid state hard drives. So what has brought about this tiny revolution? Well, today's technology has finally made it possible to have tiny laptops that are powerful enough, light weight, and energy efficient enough to be practical. Also, the Intel Atom chip (which is a minuscule marvel that offers 1.6 Ghz of computing power while sipping electricity) is a big reason why these netbooks are even made possible. So as you read this review, keep in mind that these computers are not mere toys... but are in reality tiny little work horses :)Review: The Acer Aspire OneThis review is for the Acer Aspire One with 160GB hard drive, 6-cell battery, 1.6 Ghz Atom processor with 1GB of RAM, and Windows XP pre-installed. Please note that there are several different versions of this Mini-laptop. Some of them come with different hard drives (some with solid state hard drives), and some with different battery options (like a 3-cell instead of 6-cell), and different Operation Systems too (Linux lite). I picked this one because the 6-cell battery lasts 5 hours or more, it has XP included, and it comes with a 160GB hard drive. It also makes this version the most expensive... if you're wondering why there's so many different prices floating around for the same model laptop.Well, I've had this laptop for few days now and I'm very impressed and happy with what it can do. It runs Windows XP very well and you can have several programs open at the same time... meaning that it can multi-task pretty well. It seems to have a very solid build, strong screen hinge, and a beautiful (glossy) high contrast screen. The colors are very vibrant and the black level looks great. I am surprised at how quickly it can load web pages and video from youtube... there is very little lag time. For example, if you're watching a video on youtube and you switch to full screen mode, it doesn't slow it down and switches quickly. And although one of the drawbacks of this netbook (or any netbook for that matter) is that there is no DVD or CD drive, it played DVD videos off the hard drive great and (oddly enough) comes with Win-DVD software pre-installed. One of my worries before buying this was that I thought that the screen resolution might look pixelated since the resolution is only 1024 x 600, but it actually looks very sharp. The only thing is that you do have to scroll down more often while viewing web pages than normal due to the smaller screen size. Another thing that surprised me about this laptop was that even when you use all of the USB ports (it comes with 3 total) at the same time, it doesn't slow this laptop down. I found this out when I plugged in a USB Mouse, external hard drive, and external DVD burner ... and burned a DVD using data off the external hard drive. It passed the test with flying colors and didn't skip a beat. The only major negative thing about this laptop is the design of it's mouse. Not only are the mouse buttons positioned badly on the sides of the touch sensor... but the size of the buttons are super thin and tiny. I think they could have easily improved this by at least making the mouse buttons larger. The bright side is that you can always use an external usb mouse if this is a major annoyance for you. Other than that, this laptop has surpassed all of my expectations. Here's a quick list of pros and cons:Pros:-Beautiful Screen with vibrant colors, high contrast ratio, and bright!-6-cell battery is amazing (offering 5 hours or more of use)-160GB HD, Runs XP great, good multi-tasking capabilities.-3 USB ports, and the Multi-card reader can read new SDHC cards-Built in mic and web camera (video from camera looks good)-Built-in Wifi worked well for me and web pages loaded quickly.-So portable and light... about the size of a small textbook.-Runs quiet and doesn't get hot while running.Cons:-Badly placed and designed mouse buttons-No DVD or CD drive (but no netbooks available offer one)-Screen could be larger (an extra inch could go a long way)Conclusion:If you're looking for an affordable and portable laptop that has enough processing power to run most applications, this mini-laptop might do the trick for you. It is perfect for the student that is always on the go... especially considering the long battery life. It's probably not the right one for you if you run processing intensive software though... such as video editing or gaming software. Overall, the Acer Aspire is an amazing little laptop that is a wonder (even for us tech geeks) to see in action.\"", "This is a good choice for those who are in the market for a good, basic, and cheap Laptop. I highly recommend this Laptop for websurfing, and all your Office applications. If you want more than that you will be disappointed. Keep in mind that this is a single core low energy Intel processor. As for the hard drive and RAM they put plenty in this small case so that helps the overall performance.The exterior looks nice and shiny. Keyboard is not that small, Unfortunately the display is kind of small, I think they wasted too much space in the frame.Battery life is very good, I get 3 to 4 hours on normal settings.I purchase two of this Laptops one for me and one for my niece. She's 12YO and she use it for school as a replacement for her paper notebook. She's very please with this little thing. I use mine as a traveler replacement for my new HP DV51010US compare to that the Acer is no more than a toy, but is much lighter and the battery life is way better too. So I rather carry this around when I'm away.", "I have the Aspire one model with WINXP, 1GB ram, 120 GB hard disk.  It is a great second computer: good OS, fast browsing, Itunes, light, small, great screen size and brightness, plenty of USB ports, video out, card reader, wireless, webcam.  The battery life is adequate, but not great.  This is a great small second computer.", "My husband uses this for work when he is on the road.  I wouldn't want a laptop this small for everyday use.

Could only connect via wired Ethernet.  Linpus is not the brightest kid on the block: software system and included app's weak and lacking Skype and Pidgin. Screen and case attract finger smudges like magnets.Remarks: I finally received my Aspire One (Linux version, purchased before the current price drop to $329), and the wireless was grayed out--other devices in my house can connect to wireless, so I know that my router is OK. I reloaded and recovered with Recovery Disk several times, to no avail.However, I was able to connect via wired Ethernet, and after several false starts I was able to load Skype (actually easier than several posts had indicated: just download with Firefox and tell it to Open, and the Package Manager takes over--then you have to run it with ALT-F2).But, I could not install Pidgin (a generalized Instant Messaging app.) because of some missing libpurple part(s).  The included Messenger application only serves up AIM, Google Messenger and Yahoo Messenger, but not the one that I needed, XMPP (\"\"Jabber\"\").Installing the Xfce environment disabled e-mail and calendar.But, of course, I could not live with a dead wireless radio, because my whole reason for buying the portable was to use it on the road.  So, I have just returned it to Amazon.  Pity, because, even with the lame Messenger application, I really liked this computer.\"", "Awesome value for a PC. Check out bigger batteries for  longer operating time. Not a value for a stand alone since it has no CD/DVD capability, but if you already have a desk- top version and just want a handy portable, this is a great value.", "\"IT'S TOTALLY DEAD (update February 2011)Last week my Aspire finally died -- I suspect it's a motherboard failure but I'm not putting any more time or money into this lemon.I've owned lots of computers since the 1980s and this was the worst one.  I know $300 is cheap for a computer but I expected limited features and power -- not repeated hardware failures.Too bad -- I was eager to be a big fan.  I love the idea of netbooks but now I'm back to just a regular laptop.I'll be honest -- I'm probably not going to buy Acer products anytime soon, either.YET ANOTHER FAILURE (update August 2010)The power supply just failed.  The cords and connectors look OK, so I assume it was something internal. It's a small thing but shouldn't happen. I easily found an $[...] replacement on eBay.I am still using Ubuntu Netbook Remix and am very happy with it. Highly recommended.Only one issue with Ubuntu: sometimes (not often) the WiFi connection drops and won't reconnect until I re-boot -- I think the WiFi (hardware) switch is not fully functional under Ubuntu.Finally, the battery lasts about an hour these days -- maybe a 50% reduction from when it was new. This decline is pretty typical with laptops in my experience.  (I have the four-cell model.)CATASTROPHIC FAILURE!!!Not long after I wrote that last review, my Aspire One failed -- and failed bad.  The solid state drive totally died. I checked the user groups and this is a known issue.Since my warranty expired anyway, I decided to try and fix it myself. There are YouTube videos showing how to do this. So I bought a teeny little hard drive (not solid state) for about $[...]on eBay and installed it. Interestingly, its the same drive as the iPod uses.Digging into such a tiny laptop is not for the faint of heart but about the hardest part was getting the right cable to fit which I had to order twice from China.I also ended up ruining the touch pad and now have to always use a mouse (which is a bummer but I didn't like the pad very much anyway.)Since the former OS was long-gone, I decided to switch to Ubuntu Netbook Remix -- WHICH I TOTALLY RECOMMEND. It's a huge improvement.  You might seriously consider running this instead of Windows.So, I have a fine running but slightly crippled Aspire One.Needless to say, I am downgrading my rating of this computer and can not recommend it. I would not buy another one since it completely unacceptable for a non-abused computer to fail after just a year.ONE YEAR (nearly) UPDATE:A year later, I am still very happy with the Aspire One -- I bought it for school but find it extremely useful around the house. I have WiFi and the Aspire One  makes the internet just so useful in so many ways.Of course, nearly every computer can connect to the internet but what makes the Aspire One with Linux so great is that the super-fast boot-up time means you can get on-line quickly and check something. The size makes it practical to use on the couch, reading the news at breakfast, watch HuLu  or Comedy Central in bed, etc.I also use my Aspire One as a media player and it works so great I wasn't even bothered when our portable DVD player died. Before a long car trip I copy some of my videos to DivX for my child to watch. You can get a lot of DivX videos on an 8gb memory card!  But to do this, I needed to install the VLC  media player which didn't come pre-installed -- strange, considering how standard the VLC player has become.The hardware has been flawless -- everything works like the day I opened the box. This is exceptional, considering this is a \"\"bottom end\"\" product and I use it every day.  The unit has been lightly dropped and bumped but nothing too much.But the computer isn't perfect:1) Linux: I, personally, would never consider a Windows Netbook but Linux does have its downside and may be unsuitable for some people. The \"\"lite\"\" version of Limpus on  the Aspire One must be hacked a little to be fully functional. It's not rocket science but it does involve getting on the user boards and learning about Linux.Limpus is a fine version of Linux but I really wish Acer had used a better-known version such as Ubuntu.2) Keyboard and Touch Pad: I have gotten used to the keyboard and can type pretty fast on it. However, I have never gotten used to the touchpad. But a cordless mouse solves that economically.)3) Battery. I have the 3 cell battery model and it does not last nearly as long as advertised - like 90 minutes. I've heard this is true for nearly all laptops -- not just the Aspire One.  Still, it is long enough for a class or surfing in a coffee shop.4) Software/programs: The bundled software is quite comprehensive but I had to install others and this can be more of a hassle in Linux. Also, Linux simply does not have as many programs as Windows or maybe even Apple. The good news is that all the software is free and usually good. I just love OpenOffice and hate-it when I'm forced to use MS Office. Linux does have functional-equivalents of most Adobe software but none of it is nearly as good. But, you're not as likely to do serious multi-media on a Netbook.Most browser-based programs work (like Google Docs, YouTube videos, etc) but a few do not. For example, Netflix streaming videos don't play, although it would be great to watch their videos on the couch instead of in the computer room.Limpus does do automatic updates but this doesn't work perfectly well. The \"\"automatic\"\" version of Firefox was not updating and my older version and it started getting buggy. So, I had to manually install Firefox, which, as I said, isn't super-difficult but isn't exactly easy, either. I also had to manually update Open Office to version 35) The WiFi: I have found that the internal WiFi doesn't connect to some (older?) networks, especially if encryption (WEP, etc) is turned-on. Don't know why, don't know how to fix it.Bottom line after one year -- I'm glad I bought the Aspire. I'm glad I bought the linux version. I would highly recommend it to the right person but not everybody.THREE MONTH UPDATE:PROBLEM WITH SOFTWARE UPDATEA really great feature of this computer is that it does software updates nearly automatically. Since all the software is freeware, this includes the applications.HOWEVER, when Open Office updated (which I appreciated) the icons on the desktop stopped working. The fixed involved a somewhat scary editing of some configuration files.  It all worked-out fine but it might have been impossible for people who are afraid to tweak Linux.[...]ALSO: I finally bought a real case for the computer (not just the neopreem sleeve). Fortunately, the large size DVD cases work very nicely for this computer.I bought this model (but not from Amazon)Targus DVD301 10 Sport Portable DVD Player CaseMORE COMMENTS AFTER TWO MONTHS:I've been using this for two months and am still happy with it.1) It hardly ever crashes!It has \"\"crashed\"\" maybe twice in two months. My Mac and Windows computers can't match this.  Linux isn't for everybody but it boots up fast and runs so well on this computer.  With the Linux version, you get the Aspire with no moving parts, making it use less battery power and (presumably) more sturdy if you drop it.  For me, Linux was the right choice.2) Learning Linux is not easy.[...]3) You simply must turn on the \"\"advanced menu\"\".It isn't too hard and it's the only way to add programs or change anything. (There are lots of web sites on how to do it.)The existing desktop is fine but if you install other programs, you need the advanced mode.4) It is a very nice video player.I installed VLC Media Player and it plays DivX videos great!  I convert my DVDs or TV programs on my Windows computer and put them on my Acer One using a USB thumb drive.Now that I have the Aspire, my portable DVD player just gathers dust.5) I gave up on the touch pad and only use a mouse.I bought a cheap Microsoft laptop mouse and use that almost exclusively. I just hate the touch pad. (This isn't just an Aspire One issue.)6) I bought a 8 GB expansion memory card.You'll probably need the memory, especially if you want videos or MP3s.I bought this one and it works great:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Z294OBest I can tell, Amazon is the best place to buy memory.The \"\"upgrade\"\" is very easy -- you just insert the little card and \"\"poof!\"\" it happens automatically.If you are just doing world processing, spreadsheets and a few MP3's, the included memory will probably be enough.7) I bought a better case.The case for the Apire One is very poor protection.  I bought this one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010KG1528) You absolutely will need a USB thumb drive.I owned one already but if you don't have one, you'll need it. It's the only way to get files on and off the computer.A 4 GB thumb drive is probably enough since that's about all the documents you'll be able to fit on it.FIRST IMPRESSIONS AFTER ONE WEEK:I wanted a computer that provided the basic functions I needed as a student. I commute by mass transit and bicycle so I really wanted a light machine. It needs to fit on one of those little school desks and should have enough battery life to last for a three hour class. I needed to be able to touch type lectures.The Aspire One has it all!I wanted the Linux version without the hard disk because I wanted the fast boot-up time.... it's boots up in 15 seconds. SWEET!Good:It's quiet, the screen is very nice (small of course). It's doesn't get too warm. Boot-up time is smokin'Keyboard is good-enough. It has all the programs I need for school: Web browser, word processor, spreadsheet, MP3 player, PDF viewer, etc.It uses Firefox for the web -- which is a very good browser. And it uses OpenOffice which -- in my opinion -- is better than Microsoft Office. The fantastic thing about OpenOffice is that you can install it (for free!) on your other home and work computers. A couple of years ago I totally erased MS Office on all my machines and haven't regretted it yet. And if you need to give or get a MS Office file it does fine with those in nearly all cases.The sound with headphones is good.The first-time set up process was easy -- unlike some windows machines which can take a long time.Updates were easy and pretty-much automatic.The \"\"fit and finish\"\" is good for such a small and inexpensive computer.It arrived in good shape with no problems.While the drive is small, there is enough space and expanding the memory is fairly cheap with SD cards. (I haven't done that yet.)The three USB ports are handy. So is the multi-format card reader. I haven't used the monitor or wired LAN connectors.The computer is plenty fast enough for everything I've done so far.Mixed:It's Linux.Linux is very reliable and Acer can modify it to perfectly work with the Aspire One (so there isn't much bloated stuff to slow down the computer and fill up the drive.)However, if you want to change or modify something yourself, Linux is a pain in the neck.The on-line Linux community is very helpful and super nice but they tend to be computer geeks who find it hard to be simple.It doesn't help that Acer picked a fairly obscure version of Linux. I, personally, wish they had chosen Ubuntu which is a very well known and liked version of Linux.The case is OK but I'm spending another ten bucks and buying a better one.  The one they supply isn't splash resistant and doesn't have much padding.  But it might be good enough if you are less rough on your gear than me.Negatives:The touchpad doesn't work well for me. I keep accidentally touching it when I type - (a problem I've had on other computers). I turned down the sensitivity which helped a lot. Usually, I turn it off completely (which is easy to do) and use a USB mouse.No password manager. With a portable computer, a powerfully encrypted password manager is an absolute must-have in case it's stolen. I'll try to install one but, as I've said, that isn't easy.I couldn't get videos to play without some scary fiddling in Linux.  This included sound problems with streaming videos and internet radio, too. It's all working now but, still, that shouldn't happened and a true newbie probably couldn't have fixed it by his/herself.The speakers are weak. (to be expected in a computer this small.)I haven't been able to get it to connect with my home WiFi.  (But, I have no problem with school, coffee shotps, etc  WiFi.) I expect to fix this but -- as I say -- this is a pain in the neck with Linux.No Skype.The photo management software is lame.Every so-often, there is a browser plug-in that won't work with Linux -- like the Netflix or Fox Entertainment video players. This can be true for Mac, too.For some crazy reason, the restore software is on a disk and the computer has no disk drive!  It should have been on a USB thumb drive.Summary of my first impression:I think I made the right choice and expect this computer to get me through university.  Yes, it's isn't perfect but no computer is -- especially one so small and inexpensive. And I LOVE the 15 second boot up time! (did I say that already?)\"", "This review covers the 120G Windows version of the Aspire One.I've had the Aspire One for about a week now.  I found it at the Microcenter retail store in Mayfield Heights, Ohio for the surprisingly low price of $349, plus tax, no rebates.  At that price, you definitely get a lot of bang for the buck, and a surprisingly full-featured ultra portable notebook machine.The Aspire One features a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom hyperthreading CPU (not dual-core) with some, but not all Intel extended processor features.  A decent CPU makes the sysstem pretty quick for daily tasks such as word processing and web surfing.  I don't think you'd want to use the Aspire One as a gamer platform.  The system is really aimed at the person who needs more power and flexibility than a smart phone or PDA as well as a standard operating system.  In this case, standard operating system means Windows XP home edition with a fairly well patched version of Service Pack 3 pre-installed.Something to keep in mind is that most, if not all, ultra portable notebook systems omit an optical CD/DVD drive in deference to low weight, battery life and tiny dimensions.  I haven't found the lack of an optical drive to be very off-putting.  What I've done to get around the lack of an optical device is to make ISO images of disks I need and transfer them to the Aspire One with a SDHC card or via the network.  Download Microsoft's free virtual CD driver and mount the ISOs, and it is just as good as having a real optical drive.  I had no trouble even turning DVDs into ISO images with a utility program, mounting those ISOs, then watching them with Acer's included Mediamatics DVD player.The Aspire's internal hard drive is a Hitachi 120G SATA drive.  I'm no fan of Hitachi notebook drives, as I'vce seen more failures of IBM/Hitachi drives than other brands (save recent problems with a particular model Seagate drive used in MacBooks).  Overall, the drive performance is good, and it seems appropriate for the intended market for the Aspire One.I also have an Asus Eee PC model 701, which is is the model with the 4G interal solid state drive.  I need Windows XP for the work I do, so I swapped the Linux OS on the Eee PC for Windows and it took a lot of gyrations to make it work due to the very small SSD capacity.  Also, the Eee PC has bugs handling SDHC memory cards - Even Asus' own SDHC - the CPU on the Eee PC needs to have a utility run to boost its clock and core voltage to the standard 900 Mhz from the factory default of 650 Mhz.  The Aspire has no problems wiht SDHC cards; including the 16G SDHC A-Data card by Asus.The screen on the Aspire is pretty good and reasonably bright due to its uniform LED back-lighting.  As other reviewers have noted, the screen is glossy, and it tends to show finger prints and smudges.  The resolution is 1024 * 600 which is considerably less constraining than the smaller 800 * 480 screen of the Eee PC.  Over all, I'd give a slight edge to the cripsness, viewing angle and non glare characteristics to the Eee PC, but the more spacious screen of the Aspire One trumps those esthetics.One surprisingly bright spot of the Aspire One is the keyboard.  I am surprised that it is actually pretty easy to touch type on the Aspire One.  I thought I might be relegated to hunt-n-peck typing, but that is not the case.  In contrast, the Eee PC's keyboard is too crowded to type comfortablly.  The placement of the arrow keys on the Aspire One is better.  On the Eee PC, I frequenty hit up-arrow when I mean to press the right shift key.I'd say the biggest let-down on the Aspire One is the microscopic speakers that are inexplicably located behind the vent grille on the bottom of the computer.  Don't expect to get much room-filling sound.  In contrast the Eee PC's speakers are located to the left and right of the LCD panel and provide more volume than one would expect.Since I'm an engineer, it didn't take long to want to open up the Aspire One to see what's inside.  The build quality is pretty good.  The boards are nicely finished and wiring is well dressed.  Acer has done a good job at efficient use of space and people that want to modify the hardware will have to be pretty creative to squeeze in additional components.  The Windows version comes populated with 1G of memory.  512 megs is soldered on the top of the CPU board, and there is a socket for a standard SODIMM on the bottom side that has a 512 meg SODIMM installed.  The SODIMM can be replaced with up to a 1G part.  Out of curiosity, I tried a 2G part, and it was not recogized.  1.5G is the max memory that can be installed.I don't have a problem with the 1G that comes from the factory, and I'm sticking with that configuration.  Note that doing a memory swap requires disembowling the machine, as oddly there is no removable hatch on the bottom of the machine to gain access to the SODIMM.  Unless you are good at working with small delicate parts, I'd recommend not worring about adding memory.Over all, I'd say the Aspire One is what the MacBook Air should be.  The Asipre One is a little more portable than the MacBook Air, and features three USB slots, a multi SDHC/other types card reader, as second SDHC reader and a real 15-pin VGA video socket.  No oddball video port as you'd have to deal with on the Mac, you get the real McCoy VGA port.  Of course, there is the obligatory gig-E ethernet port and Atheros 802.11G wireless card.For $349 + tax, how can you resist?  Get one, you'll love it."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0017747264355421066, 0.17250417172908783, 0.017279300838708878, 0.2858984172344208, 0.00011794068268500268, 0.005445490125566721, 0.2581271529197693, 0.011548569425940514, 0.00024309639411512762, 0.23104141652584076, 0.00022198421356733888, 0.01579771749675274]]}
