I should say that in general this computer is great and it's pretty fast - even though mine has only 4gigs of RAM (3 gigs for OSX and 1 gig for Windows 8 on parallel).  I should say that I recommend that if you are planning on spending this kind of money on an Apple product, getting Applecare should be a priority - when I bought the computer, my SD card wasn't working.  I just took it into an Apple Store and the price of repair without warranty would have been $310, with Applecare it was $0.  The premium for a computer with Applecare has already paid off.", "\"If you are in the market for a 15\"\" MacBook Pro this is the one you want, If you are not a tech person, and you are looking to buy a MacBook Pro 15\"\", read this review, It will save you a lot of researchAs of right now this model is on sale almost everywhere, because they are the high end model from early 2011, and are now clearance items. The current high-end 15\"\" model retails for 2199, where-as you can get one of these for 1799$.The newest high-end model has only one \"\"improvement\"\", which is a 2.4 ghz processor, a minuscule .2ghz increase from the previous 2.2ghz.Reason #1.The \"\"Newest Model\"\" MacBook 15.4\"\" 2.2ghz(late 2011) priced around 1700$ is a base model, this may look the one to buy, because it is newer. This is not the case, the Early 2011 (Old Version) is a high end model, this models processer is the same speed as the \"\"Newest Version\"\" but it is not the same processer, the \"\"Old Version's\"\" processer has a significantly better turbo boost.Reason #2The \"\"Newest Version\"\" has the 6970m graphics card w/ 512mb Vram, where as the \"\"Old Version\"\" has the same graphics card but with 1024mb(1gb) which is literally doubled!Whatever you do, Do not buy the MacBook Pro 15.4 2.0 ghz (Early 2011)\"\"Old Version\"\", it has a 256mb graphics card which IMHO is a rip-off.\"", "\"First off this computer feels well built.  It is sturdy, and solid (no cheap feeling plastic or hollow points inside).  The computer is really thin, and looks good.  The OS is very easy to use and was ready to go after I typed in my name and basic info.  The OS found my wireless printer instantly (using Bonjour) and downloaded the HP software without me doing anything (other than going to Print and selecting my Printer).  The screen looks really good, and even though it is not full HD it looks very good.  The DVD drive is nice and sucks disks in when you put the disk in (like the PS3), the only weird thing is that you have to put the disk almost all the way in before it pulls it in.  This model has 2 USB ports, which are good for cables, however, if you are trying to use a flash drive, you may not be able to utilize both ports with the another cable in (depends on your device and equipment).  The power adapter that comes with the computer is really nice, it is magnetic so if you hit the cable it just falls out; the power cable also has a handy pop out hand that ties the cable nicely, so you do not have a bunch of cables hanging out.  The computer does not have a VGA/DVI/HDMI out port, so you have to buy an adapter to use an external monitor, the computer easily recognizes when to use which monitor (when both are open it extends display (unless you specify to clone) or if you close the MacBook Pro the External monitor goes at its native resolution.  I use a 21\"\" HP monitor and it works fine (when extending or External only) at 1080p.OS X is really nice.  It is super easy to use and learn (it takes a while to get use to if you try to do everything like you would in Windows).  The settings are pretty straightforward, and Spotlight search is really good at finding what you need.  the Mail app and Calendar app work well with my Gmail account.  If you are a developer then you will find Xcode very useful (which is free from the App Store), and if you are like me and have a few Windows applications that you have to have, Bootcamp is super easy to setup.  Specify how big a partition to give to Windows, download the Windows Drivers CD file, and then insert the Windows 7 CD.  Write to the proper partition (follow Bootcamp's instructions (download or print before starting)), and then once you are in Windows put the driver CD to get Windows to recognize the hardware.  To boot into Windows in the future hold down Option or Alt (depends on which keyboard you use) at startup (if you get the Apple logo you missed it) and get the boot menu.  Windows works very well in the MacBook Pro and sees 8 Processors (4 Cores, 4 Virtual Cores from the Intel i7).  Windows only seems to use the ATI Graphics card, not the Intel Graphics, because Windows does use the switch graphics card like the Mac does.  Windows can also take advantage of the external display using the adapter (Start + P) to change external display settings in Windows.  Also, when in Mac OS X I see that my battery time remaining (when just surfing the web) usually shows 7.5 hours, as you perform tasks the time remaining automatically changes, to show how much battery you have using the current task. -- Note, this battery is not changeable, you have to have Apple change it (like the iPhone)The computer that I got (from Amazon) came with Lion, so I did not have to upgrade, however, Lion no longer includes the backup disks that were included with previous MacBook Pros.  Because of this you have a recovery partition on the HDD, and you do not get iWeb and iDVD(which would normally be on the iLife disk, so that is sort of disappointing -- you do get iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand).In the end, this computer is very well built, and should last a long time (since it is very sturdy), the computer is also very powerful and should be beyond adequate for quite some time in the future.  I hope to get a long life out of this computer, and since it can support Mac and Windows it should be able to accomplish everything!  I really like the computer, and hope to have it for some time.  If anything changes I will post it here!\"", "\"I purchased the new Macbook Pro 15\"\" (from Amazon, thank you) the very first weekend it was released.  I produce videos for my company and felt like this was a super upgrade in power for me.The machine is now having problems with hard freezes when I try to render video.  The system fans start to rapidly build to around 6000 rpm and the machine goes into a state where the only option is a hard reset.  The machine is REALLY hot too.  At this point, I have noticed other postings on the Apple forums which suggest that this is a problem others are reporting about the new line.I realize I'm not offering much background at this time but I wanted to make it known in case anyone is considering a purchase.  Here is my immediate take:1)  If you feel you can benefit from the horsepower, I would definitely recommend this machine.2)  If you don't need it TODAY, wait about 30 days before purchasing and see how this plays out in the forums.I have an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar and I fully anticipate they will want to replace it.  Despite this issue, I still LOVE my Apple gear and will always recommend them.UPDATE:  I noted in later postings below that I have learned a little more about my issue.  As a result, I am revising my rate to be 5 stars since the problem appears to be related to a non-Apple application.\"", "\"I just recently purchased one of these laptops.  I had mine customized by Apple - a 1680x1050 high-res screen and 500GB 7200RPM hard drive instead of the 750GB 5400RPM.  I am extremely glad that I did.The screen is wonderful on it.  I previously owned a 2008 MacBook Pro 15.4\"\" with a 1440x900 matte screen, and I much prefer the glass-covered high-res screen on the new one.  I sat them side-by-side and the color difference is tremendous.  Obviously, the pixel density on the new one is also iPhone4-like, and great for typing or reading.  At one time I had a 23\"\" computer monitor that was the same resolution as this 15.4\"\" MBP, so it is really amazing.  It's also great how easy it is to really clean the screen on this new computer - since it is all glass you can put a bit of water on the cleaning cloth and it gets perfectly clean.The internal hardware in this new MBP is also flat-out incredible.  I have purchased Windows 7 Pro for it to run in Boot Camp in case I need it for work and had a very interesting find.  I also own a self-built gaming desktop I made a couple of years ago, which scores a 5.2 on the Windows Experience Index.  Get this - the new laptop scores a 5.9!  Its quad-core i7 processor scores 7.6 and the AMD graphics scores a 7.  Its hardware is comparable to a $3000 Windows gaming laptop, but it gets twice the battery life!  I have also purchased a 1TB external hard drive from Seagate that has FireWire 800, USB 3, and eSATA support.  They have promised in the future that they will make a Thunderbolt connector for it, so it will work even faster on this laptop.Other great features of the new MBP are 4GB of DDR3 RAM, an HD webcam built-in, backlit keyboard, and its SDXC card slot.  As a photographer, I am much happier to have an SD slot instead of the ExpressCard slot on my old MBP.  I was originally going to wait this summer for the new MacBook Air, but I am very glad I purchased the Pro instead.  Yes, it is heavier and thicker, but 10 times as powerful and has a better screen!Some people complain about these being \"\"too expensive for what they are\"\" or \"\"just made for Apple fanboys\"\" but the truth is neither statement is correct.  They are just the most reliable and well-built laptops on the planet, and run very fast and long on one battery charge.  Things like a lack of BluRay or USB 3 are not really a big deal, given that Thunderbolt will be 10 times faster than USB 3 and BluRay is not really necessary when you can easily download high-def movies or use Netflix.  If really obsessed with BluRay, just get a slim external drive and use Windows on Boot Camp.  MacOS X Lion is currently the best operating system in production, with tons of features but very easy to learn everything on.  iPhoto, Mail, and Safari are excellent programs for daily use - very simple yet feature-filled, and now can be full-screen.I highly recommend this computer to anyone who wants a fast, powerful, and long-lasting laptop.  Unlike almost all other companies, Apple products retain value a lot better, as they tend to last longer and are much more reliable.  I sold my previous MBP quickly, for about half of what I paid for it 3 years ago, something rarely seen when selling older computers.  My suggestion would be to buy this computer, customize it with a high-res screen if you always work with photos or videos, and buy Windows 7 OEM if needed.  Windows OEM is much cheaper than the full version and it is made for installing to new computers - $129 for Windows 7 Pro compared to $299 for the full version.  The only slight issue with Windows is that unlike in MacOS, the system will not automatically switch graphics cards to save battery.  Therefore, in Windows it is always on the high-power graphics and battery life drops from 7 hours to about 4-5, which is still better than battery on 99% of high-power Windows laptops.As someone who has owned 10 or 12 PCs, 3 Macs, and worked on 6-core brand-new servers, I am just amazed at the speed and power of this new MacBook!  Much better rated than any other computer I have ever used, and even open to higher speed given that I chose to stick with the 2.2Ghz i7 instead of paying $300 more for the 2.3Ghz.  Also, 8GB of RAM is an option, as well as up to 512GB SSDs, which would offer much better data read/write than even my 7200RPM normal drive.  If you are looking for a new, fast, reliable, powerful laptop, look no further.  You've found it!\"", "\"I recently purchased this MacBook, and I'm very satisfied overall. The styling is attractive to the eye and it's a very powerful little machine. 15\"\" really feels perfect compared to the 13\"\" or the 17\"\". The i7 processor makes this computer really fly. There hasn't been anything that I've tried tht this computer can't handle. I did install windows 7 on it through bootcamp to play a few games. The dedicated video card handles all modern games perfectly and can do max graphic settings on almost all of them.A special note would be to mention that this computer does get very warm while doing heavy graphic work. This is completely normal and is why it is considered a portable computer rather than a laptop. It is very uncomfortable to use on your lap due to the heat. I'd strongly recommend a portable desk if you do choose to use it on your lap. I bought a Logitech portable desk and it runs perfectly without becoming uncomfortable. Great computer!\"", "\"As my title says, I'm a long time PC user for the last 15 years or so, in multiple desktop and laptop forms.  My photography hobby demanded I get a machine better designed to handle multimedia applications and digital photo post processing.  Although it's pricy, I decided to go for the 15\"\" MacBook Pro with the dedicated GPU for extra video processing power and the 750 GB HD for storage.  I can say this purchase was well worth it.  I have used Apple computer products since early college and they gone from being impressive looking but playing catchup to PCs in terms of utilities, to creating their own niche.Coupled with a gorgeous LCD screen and powerful processor.  This machine is a joy to use in terms of ergnomics and performance.  Also it couples well with my Apple brand wireless Magic Mouse and the bluetooth pairing is effortless.\"", "\"I've been a power Mac user since its introduction in 1984, and have owned various portable and desktop configurations since then. Frequently, you will see major leaps in desktop performance, but it is rare to see dramatic improvements with laptops (you typically see 25-50% improvements). But I have to say, in all the Mac laptops I've owned since my very first PowerBook G4, this is the most dramatic leap in performance I've ever seen. Not only is it 2.8x FASTER than my mid-2009 2.66GHz Core2-Duo 15\"\" MacBook Pro, it is slightly faster than my 2008 2.8GHz dual-quad-core MacPro!I bought my 2011 MacBook Pro (2.3GHz quad-core i7, 15\"\" high-res screen) as an upgrade from my mid-2009 15\"\" unibody MacBook Pro.  I wasn't expecting to be LITERALLY blown away by the raw computing and graphics performance of this update. I have run every standard benchmark suite in comparison not only with my 2009 MBPro, but also against my 2008 dual 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Xeon \"\"Harpertown\"\" MacPro. And to my surprise, this little wonder beats BOTH machines in CPU and graphics performance. Imagine carrying a laptop with true desktop power. My real-world tests (iMovie, Aperture, Photoshop and Nikon Capture NX) simply validate the benchmark results.Here's what my tests reveal:- Geekbench: 10450 (vs. 3722 for 2009 MBPro vs. 9533 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 CPU: 5.56 (vs. 1.53 for 2009 MBPro vs. 5.76 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 GPU: 36.38 (vs. 13.77 for 2009 MBPro/nVidia vs. 26.51 for 2008 MacPro/ATI 5770)Now THAT is impressive!Even though the Intel \"\"SandyBridge\"\" core i7 processor in this Mac is advertised as quad-core, each core supports 2 simultaneous threads (8 operations), which you can literally see when running Cinebench. If your computing needs don't support multiple cores, the i7 can bump the speed of a single core up to 3.4GHz (TurboBoost) as well.To truly match/replace your desktop environment, you'll need to replace the built-in hard drive with an SSD, because 2.5\"\" hard disks, even in 7200rpm configurations, are much slower than their 3.5\"\" desktop counterparts. I bought my SSD through OWC, and I'm seeing anywhere from 3-40x(!) faster performance for I/O intensive operations such as booting, working with VMWare/Parallels virtual machines, and processing large files (images, video, etc). It is simply the best investment you can make, if you can afford it.Beyond the raw power, there are a number of incremental improvements over the 2009 model:- integrated Intel 3000 graphics, and ATI Radeon 6750M (dedicated graphics with 1GB VRAM)- 1.33GHz memory backplane, supporting up to 16GB of RAM through third-party modules- new Thunderbolt interface using the Mini DisplayPort connector (super-fast 10Gbps interconnect for up to 6 devices, although no Thunderbolt devices are available yet)- Mini DisplayPort supports digital audio and video on a single cable (including HDMI with suitable third-party adapters)- higher-resolution FaceTime camera- SD slot now supports SDXC- updated optical drive (ingest mechanism is less finicky for me)- better battery lifeThe high-resolution screen in this model REALLY makes a difference over the standard screen (which I had on my 2009 model). The 1680x1050 resolution is the same as my older 21\"\" Apple Cinema Display. I was afraid the higher resolution would make it harder to read (the text is smaller), but the brightness and wide-angle visibility makes this one of the best displays you can get in a laptop form factor. If you work in heavily-lit or outdoor environments, you might want to consider the anti-glare (matte) screen which is available in Apple's build-to-order configurations. Both dual and mirrored display configurations are possible - simultaneously supporting full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of color. Interestingly, in my configuration, I was only able to get an external HDMI display to operate on the high-performance discrete GPU only.Another pleasant surprise for me was the battery life of this new 2011 model. Even with all that processing power, I'm consistently getting 6-7 hours of usable life (lightweight not heavy work). One big tip for saving battery life is to install the freeware gfxCardStatus utility, which lets you choose integrated only (much lower power), automatic, or discrete/ATI graphics. Apple's own Energy Saver system preference only lets you choose between automatic or discrete. And when you're running on the battery, this can be problematic because simply launching some programs (eg. PhotoShop) can force the discrete adapter. Like earlier designs, the battery is built into the unit and cannot be swapped or user-replaced. In practical use, I don't find this to be a problem because I'm getting the same extended runtime that I got on earlier MacBook Pros with 2 battery swaps.Rounding out the compliment of ports (on the left side only) is Gb ethernet, FireWire 800, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and audio in (both supporting analog and digital/TOSlink connectors). If there is any weakness, it would be nice to have a right-side USB port, or at least enough separation between the USB ports to not force you to use a short USB dongle cable with your 3G wireless card (if you want to use both ports).As with Apple's other MacBook Pros, this model is built on their \"\"unibody\"\" construction, where the main case is crafted from a single piece of aluminum. This makes the laptop amazingly rigid, and also allows it to be lighter weight, thinner, and better at dissipating heat than more traditional laptop designs. Apple makes it easy to upgrade the memory or hard drive (you just need a fine #00 phillips screwdriver to remove the screws on the bottom plate).One last note on this MacBook Pro - Apple bundles a special build of OS X 10.6.6 which you will want to immediately upgrade to 10.6.7 using Apple's Software Update mechanism. (You can't apply the 10.6.7 combo updater since this version of 10.6.6 is later than the standard build). The \"\"OS X 10.6.7 Update for Early 2011 MacBook Pro\"\" includes an important fix for the discrete graphics processor under heavy workloads.For those of you (like me) who still have older PowerPC software that hasn't been updated (Quicken!), this will most likely be the last generation of Apple notebooks to run on OS X 10.6.x \"\"Snow Leopard\"\". The next release of OS X 10.7 (\"\"Lion\"\") has removed support for running PowerPC applications (Rosetta). This alone was worth me upgrading to this model.\"", "I just upgraded from the 2011 15 inch 2.0ghz MBP to the 2011 2.2 mostly because of the graphics card upgrade to a full gb. I also installed a new owc 240 gb mercury extreme pro 6g ssd along with 8gb of memory. To me it didnt make a whole lot of sense to spend that much money on extras and not go for the higher end model 15 inch.Ill be honest the 2.0 ghz version with 256mb of vmemory was more than enough and performs very well in comparison to the 2.2 version. Most people would never know the difference if they took the pepsi challenge.I am a label whore however and I couldnt sleep at night knowing there was more out there.The smart move and most cost effective however wouldve been to upgrade the 2.0 version mbp with probably the most stable and most reliable ssd in my opinion on the market and thats the samsung 470. it has a 3gbs data transfer rate so its not as fast as those in sata III and at 6gbps but again the difference in real world computing scenarios is negligible. It isnt however apple friendly and neither are the firmware updates if you have a mac.I wanted the fastest while  still conserving some reliability so an OWC ssd with a five year warranty and excellent customer service and the latest firmware included before shipment was the obvious choice over an OCZ. Both ssds are sata III and have a 6gbps data transfer rate.No other upgrade will make a bigger difference in the performance of your computer than an ssd. Dont waste your money on a substandard apple offering though, there's a lot better offerings in both ssds and memory out there.I will also never purchase another computer through anyone other than Amazon.My first 2011 mbp in 2.2 ghz showed up after riding around in a ups truck in 115 degree Phoenix heat all day...I dont know how hot the inside of the truck was where the cargo is kept but the computer on arrival was nearly too hot to handle with my bare hands, I knew there would be issues.The display was loose and unstable when opened and the battery took a health hit showing just 90% health...unacceptable for a brand new 2000 dollar computer.I had zero problems getting a replacement and a morning delivery time. It was sent and arrived in one business day, and before I could send UPS's goof back to amazon...I was already using my new one. The reliability, discount, plus zero tax always makes me wonder why anyone would buy anywhere else. Any way just my thoughts hope they may help someone.I did take one star for price and the cost of the apple name and like I said I wouldve been just as happy with the performance of the 2.0 ghz version if i werent so neurotic.Just one more quick edit...the free upgrade to lion from apple's website couldn't be easier.", "Beautiful Macbook Pro that has an i7 processor with 4GB of RAM at purchase.  If you are looking to get a MacBook Pro with a DVD this is a great model to get.  This model is hard to find new and you can get a used one at about half of the original cost when it was new and usually in good shape. With a MacBook Pro and 4GB of RAM is like running a Windows laptop with 8-12 GB of RAM, Macs are that effective with memory utilization and processor turbo boost.  If you plan on running intense programs add at least 8GB of RAM. Nice extras like the lit Apple, back-lit keyboard, aluminum body, track pad gestures and the chicklet keyboard are awesome.  Where Macs really shine is battery life which is nearly double that if a windows laptop.", "\"I've used a pretty wide variety of both PCs and Macs, both for personal use and for work. I've used them for gaming, development, and run-of-the-mill tasks. However, my last two machines (three counting this one) were all Macs. I'm still a believer in the PC for hardcore desktop gaming, but as far as laptops go I'm pretty much sold on Apple. Why? Quite simply, Mac laptops are just a lot less fuss. They don't break down or exhibit weird quirks as often as PC notebooks, generally last longer on battery power, and take up less space. For my latest machine, I decided to splurge a bit and get something that can actually play games- fully intending to take advantage of Boot Camp to run the loads of Windows titles I usually play on my monster desktop gaming rig. The 15\"\" 2011 Pro with 1 GB video was the obvious choice: not so big I can't carry it around, yet with enough muscle to run anything in my library. Was it worth the huge price tag? In a word: yes.Pros:Case design is superior, not just elegant but functional as well. It's actually somewhat water resistant (don't ask) and very easy to clean. The form factor is slim and handy- easy to carry around.Hardware layout is well thought out, and design is excellent. Speakers are positioned so the sound is crisp, almost as if you had externals. Camera is sharp. Trackpad is huge and very responsive.Mac OS X is still the best OS out there. I must say, Windows 7 is a whole lot closer than any other previous incarnation of that franchise, but OS X still has it beat in many ways: no defragging, doesn't degrade over time (especially when used for software development), more stable, boots up and shuts down faster, and generally speaking more intuitive in UI layout. You'll also have a lot less to worry about as far as malware and spyware are concerned.Screen quality is great, and the backlighting for both the display and keyboard are excellent. Note: I strongly recommend paying the extra for the high-res 1680x1050 display upgrade, unless you're always going to have your machine hooked up to an external display. It is totally worth it. Second note: if you do get this upgrade, don't bother with the anti-glare, as it's equally totally NOT worth it (you can get a third party stick-on that does the same for a lot less, and is removable).Has enough power for pretty much anything. RAM/hard drive are easily upgradeable- buy it yourself and install it yourself; it's about as hard as loading VHS cassettes. This model straight out of the box can run most current games on max settings.Dual boot is easy to set up. I'm running Win 7 64 alongside Snow Leopard for gaming purposes. Boot camp sets up all the drivers with little fuss. The only issues I've seen are that the graphics card switching doesn't work on Windows, which eats up battery a lot faster, and right clicking with the trackpad is a bit awkward. The latter is easily solved by hooking up a 2-button mouse.Magsafe is awesome. I'd probably be out a few dozen machines from tripping over the cable if not for this simple yet brilliant feature.Battery life is great. It doesn't usually last for 7 hrs as advertised; 5 hrs is more typical when doing various tasks. However, even that is huge compared to most similarly specced laptops.For a laptop of this size with this power, it's really light.Apple's customer support is top-notch. If you're in the US their stores are pretty much everywhere, and you can get same-day repair service in most cases. Try doing that with Dell or HP sometime...Cons:The mini displayport/Thunderbolt connector means you'll need an adapter for pretty much every different video device you hook up. They're a bit awkward to hook up and can get bulky if you have enough of them.If you run 3-D intensive apps like most games the big video card turns on, and it runs pretty darn hot. When the fans kick in, it gets pretty loud.Compared to some older unibody platforms, it's harder to get at the innards. You have to unscrew the whole bottom plate and remove it to even access the battery. For most users, though, this shouldn't be too big a deal.It's considerably more expensive than a similarly specced Windows laptop.Doesn't have a blu-ray drive, if you care. Most Windows machines in this price range do.Is this machine for everyone? Probably not if due to the price alone, but I've found less to complain about than just about every other laptop I've owned. I'm still a fan of the regular MacBook for non-gaming/coding tasks due to its smaller form factor, lower cost, and lighter weight. However, it doesn't have the power to do anything more serious than video playback. If that's all you're going to do and ease of transport is a priority, then go for it. If you're planning on replacing a desktop or want some serious mobile power, then the Pro is a better choice.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0032437241170555353, 0.020121246576309204, 0.3433937430381775, 0.30478742718696594, 0.0001801433099899441, 0.008638694882392883, 0.009008137509226799, 0.001973016420379281, 0.0006395052187144756, 0.2846558690071106, 0.02335849590599537]]}
