You begin by riding a bus (not a train - good job changing things up, Nintendo) to your new digs, followed by a part-time job with Tom Nook (with exactly the same tasks as before, sans the \"\"helping out neighbors\"\" stuff). Then, you start playing. You'll dig up fossils (thankfully, you don't have to mail them into a museum in this game - +1 for this version), fish (it's much harder to make money in this fashion, as it is much harder to catch red snapper here), plant trees (the same as before), all on a real-time schedule. Just like before, K.K. will appear in your town on Saturday's at 8 PM, and just like before, holidays and special events will occur on their designated dates (and they will differ depending on the region of the world in which you reside - not that this helps me).The problem is, that's it. The graphics have changed little to not-at-all. The environment no longer has 36 squares, but continuous scrolling actually gives me a sea-sick feeling, as it always seems I am descending/ascending a hill. Switching between items is quite painful in this version as well (some \"\"hotkey\"\" buttons would have been helpful). There is little use of the Wii motion control that I have found.All in all, this is a lackluster offering. With the Wii online mode, this game could have been incredible (imagine each player creating a part of a larger world, with the ability of free travel from one town to another). However, Nintendo continues to think that all of its customers are pedophiles and psychotics, and so we continue to be greeted by the silly \"\"friend code\"\" nonsense. I am also disappointed in the removal of in-game video games here. While this is to be expected (with the Wii virtual console), it stinks nonetheless.This game is called \"\"City Folk\"\" because you can go to a city (the city consists of a few stores). I find this feature mostly unremarkable at present.And yet, I still give the offering three stars. Part of this is the fact that, while this game diverges little to none from the source material, that source material is quite strong. The other part is that I am playing the game in French, and the French was actually done quite well, with many colloquialisms not usually found in formal French learning. If you've never played Animal Crossing before, this is a perfectly perfunctory offering into the series. If you have bought both \"\"AC\"\" for the Gamecube and \"\"AC: Wide World\"\" for the DS, you are essentially buying the same thing again. Happy gaming!\"", "Animal Crossing fans will be delighted.Animal Crossing is a game series where you live your life,among anthromorphic animals. The game never ends.This game brings little new to the series,like Wild World. However,that is a good thing. You can import your characters from WW,but they will still stay in that game. You can travel to a city too.It's a great game.", "Animal crossing is one of those games that you can play continuously and never get bored. This game plays like the classic animal crossing games in regards to its game dynamic, the addition of the city is great (though I've never actually gone into the city). The only thing I don't like is that the gameplay is a little difficult with the Wii-mote.", "I absolutely adored the first Animal Crossing game for the GameCube. I'd play it every single day for about 2 years, filling up my catalog, hunting for bugs, fishing, getting all the fossils, trading items with friends, etc. I even went the extra mile and got the E-Reader accessory just so I could get surprises from the Animal Crossing cards that were made. For me, Animal Crossing was easily one of the top 3 GameCube games, and I put it in my top 25 favorite games list not that long ago on here. Then...the DS game Wild World came out, and I just couldn't get into it. The 'rolling world' effect was annoying, there wasn't much new content that was fun, and I didn't care to get another copy when it got stolen. When City Folk here came out a few years ago, it didn't look much different from Wild World, and I noticed that Nintendo was very disappointed with sales for the game, even after they hyped the whole voice chat accessory for it. Well, I've recently given this game a chance, and it hurts me to say that I can have more fun with the original than this newer version, which I almost just called an upgrade, but it's anything bur that. But before I get started, if you're new to the Animal Crossing games, you can change my ratings to 4 stars for both fun and the overall rating, as it'll be fresh to you.City Folk plays exactly like the previous games, where you start your life in a new city full of talking animals, digging up fossils, catching fish and bugs to fill the town museum, helping people deliver items to one another, and take part in town events like fishing tournaments and even holidays. When you enter the city, you don't have any money, and run a few errands for Tom Nook, the local shop owner. He actually lets you live in one of the little houses nearby, but you'll be in debt, and need to pay it off in order to get a bigger house, and for him to get a bigger store. And that's the main part of the game, more or less, though the game really doesn't have any objectives that need to be met, and it never really 'ends'. You can see the credits on saturdays when K.K. Slider shows up to play music, and the credits play while he sings.On paper, the game sounds really boring, but it's fun and engaging, if you're new at least. There are many different kinds of fish and bugs to collect, with many only being available at certain times of the day and during certain months. Some bugs are incredibly fast, and can take some players years to catch if they're not quick enough. Fossils are dug up, identified at the museum, and if they don't have what you brought in yet, they'll take it and display the bones in the appropriate section. Of course, you don't have do donate fish, bugs, paintings or fossils- you can sell them to Tom Nook, trade them with other villagers if they ask for one, or just display them in your own home. Decorating your house is one of the more fun elements in the game, as Tom Nook only has a couple of items for sale each day that you can put in your home, with new stuff coming in all the time. You'll want to pay off that debt fast, and make your house bigger and bigger so you can make room for the cooler stuff, as you home barely qualifies for a shack when you start out. Wallpaper, carpet, beds, couches, dressers, ninja swords, ponds, bonsai trees, there are hundreds of things you can decorate your house with. Some items are themed, like the Lovely series which has a heart design with everything, or the Kiddie series which resembles an indoor play area for toddlers, complete with elephant slide. You can have up to 4 different people in the same town, and can send letters to one another along with items to help them out. It's pretty fun competing to see who can get the most things in the museum. There's also the online mode which is like the Wild World feature, but a bit smoother of course.I just made it sound like fun, but the thing is- I just basically repeated what I'd say for anyone playing the GameCube game, aside from the online play. There are barely any new features here that I can say anything good about, and then there's another problem- there just isn't that much to do. I remember talking to villagers in the original, and they'd almost always have something for me to deliver to another villager, or want me to buy something of theirs. In City Folk, I'd actually be surprised when a villager would have me run an errand, since most of the time they'd just spew some cute lines or ask me to change their catchphrase. Unless you have a lot of friends with the game that you can visit online, there's not going to be much to do aside from the usual fishing/bug hunting. But what about the City, the key feature here that's even mentioned in the game's name? Very disappointing. Gracie, the stylin' uppity giraffe, now has her own store full of overpriced furniture and clothing. There's a theater where you can watch someone give odd performances, and walk out with a new expression for your character to do while walking around. The black market businessman Redd is back, but he requires both an invitation AND a bit of money to enter his shop now. And there's also a barber, shoe shiner, and Katrina the fortune teller has a building as well. It sounds like a lot, but it's usually a waste of time coming here unless you REALLY want to fill your catalog and spend a lot of Bells on Gracie's stuff. It's not much of a city, especially when everything's on one side of the street.My other problems have to do with minor things and the controls. The main complaint I have as far as minor things go (aside from the rolling world) is that when you run around on the grass, which is what covers the majority of your town, it deteriorates quickly, resulting in your town turning into a desert wasteland. You'll need to plant flowers over any dead areas in order to restore the grass, but it a lot of time. I guess this was made so that characters could create paths to areas they frequent the most, but when you're chasing after super fast dragonflies, you're going to be killing off a lot of grass quick. So...unless you don't care about how your town looks, you're going to be walking most of the time. But the controls are something that I couldn't get used to. The game uses the nunchuck for movement with the analog stick, and the Wii remote for selecting things from the item screen. Why? Why can't we just use the analog stick for everything?In the end, the whole game feels rushed, and I can't recommend this to longtime fans. If you've never played an AC game before though, you're in for a treat, as I have fond memories from getting into this series years ago and having everything feel so new to me. This is truly a unique franchise, but I hate seeing a lack of progress on Nintendo's part with this version. I hate that the best new feature to me was that you can take pictures in-game and save them to the SD card, but even then, you can only have one picture saved on the menu at a time.But you know what? The Wii IS backwards compatible with GameCube games...and the old Animal Crossing is cheaper than this. So...", "Let me just say, I've loved everything Animal Crossing has put out in the franchise. If I have the system, I purchase the game within a few days or weeks of it's release. Sure the fundamentals of the game are the same, but generally there's enough new additions to the game to make the new purchases all worthwhile.With that in mind, I was eager to pick up City Folk. I'd loved the stuff that had come out on the GameCube & the DS, so I figured that I'd fall just as much in love with the Wii version. Well... after playing it off & on, I came to one conclusion: while the game was interesting, it was just much more fun to play this on the DS & GameCube. Granted, this version has a few new tricks such as being able to go to the city & a few new characters to meet. But there were just a few things that I thought got in the way of gameplay.It was strange getting used to playing with the new remote of the Wii. It made it a lot harder to position my character to move things about in the house or pick up or use my tools. After a while practice made it easier, but it was still a pain to get used to. The same thing goes for writing letters- letter writing is sort of a dull task to do now.The worst thing I've come in contact with so far though, is that the grass gets worn down depending on how frequently your character walks across it. If you were to run across the grass, it'll wear it down even faster. Since there's no quick & easy way to get the grass BACK, this makes for a huge pain- especially since there's stuff in the game that's grass dependent. I can understand that this is to make the game more realistic, but it's just something that is pretty much a pain in the tuckus. You can supposedly plant lots of flowers that will help the grass come back, but come on... not all players want to spend hours maintaining their towns- they want to PLAY! (My house is a great example of that- my mom & sister don't mind spending time maintaining everything, but my niece & I just want to get out there & play around.)Overall, this is something I'd recommend for most AC fans. For the newbies, this game will be illuminating- they'll more than likely love it. For the AC fans though, we won't find much new stuff here. It'll be mostly for the novelties.", "\"If you have never played \"\"Animal Crossing\"\" on another system, you will almost certainly find something to like about this game. My whole family (son 12, daughter 16, wife 46, and me 42) play it for hours on end. Other than the occasional rude animal that might call you \"\"stupid\"\", there is little to nothing objectionable. The game is open ended in that your character can pretty much do what you want, when you want. My wife enjoys fishing, I like fossil hunting, and my kids like bug hunting. The only real \"\"goal\"\" is to expand your house and collect furnishings. There are also a lot of date driven events, like contests (catching the biggest bugs, for example), fireworks, etc. We also enjoy being able to visit other towns via Wi-Fi, a very cool feature that works very well! The game is very fun and somewhat addicting.For those that have played Animal Crossing on the DS, the Wii version really doesn't add that much different to the basic game. Sure, there are some new characters and most of the shops are now a bus ride away but the overall game of collecting, fishing, selling, and buying is the same as on the DS. Where we were very disappointed is in the lack of local multi-player support. With the DS version, all four of us could go to the same town at the same time. Since the Wii version is not fully compatible you can not use your DS characters interactively. Sure you can import you base character, but it's still single player. In some ways, the Wii version is a step backwards for multi-player fun.Overall, a great game! Highly recommended!\"", "Positive:+ very bright, fun atmosphere+ towns are big+ graphics and frame rate are incredibly smooth+ superb Wii controls that don't overdo themselves+ unique, quirky sense of humor+ relaxing, fun musicNegative:- the game is hardly even an update to Wild World- Nook's store takes way too long to expand- the city is small and lacking anything that's actually worth your timeAnimal Crossing: Wild World on the DS was a huge hit because it managed to be so and big and fun on such a small console. Three years down the road, we now have a third entry in the series that's a great game by all means... there are just so few differences between it and its predecessors that it feels like a quick cash-in by Nintendo.City Folk starts the same as the other games, but this time you're coming in by bus rather than train or cab. You name your town, answer a few questions, are introduced to a bit of the game's shining, brilliant sense of personality and humor, and then you're off. You start by working for Tom Nook, the raccoon owner of Nook's Cranny, to pay off a bit of your mortgage on your new house, but once you finish a few jobs you're on your own to do whatever you want.Animal Crossing's towns have always been big, but this game somehow feels bigger than before. As far as activities you have fruit growing that you can sell to Nook for money, go fishing or catch bugs, participate in the fun little activities that go on around town, and more. The gameplay mechanics involved are incredibly simple but it still manage to be pretty enjoyable.One of the things that gives Animal Crossing such a huge appeal is its unique, charming personality and sense of humor. Talking to neighbors, which could be an extremely boring pastime, is spiced up with bits of quirky humor. Blathers (the museum owner) always makes a reference to how he's the only worker there and how there's nothing in the museum's collection. Lyle, while annoying to talk to as he takes up a lot of your time, is actually pretty witty and funny. Every turn of a corner in City Folk will reveal yet another aspect of its fun personality and sense of humor.City Folk also has some nice music tracks. Whether you're just walking around town or cruising through the city, the tunes are nice, relaxing, and very fitting to the environment. The sound effects are also pretty decent, retaining the game's feel and not getting in the way. The only problem with the area of sound is that everything, including the music, is recycled from Wild World (except the music that plays in the city of course). This is kind of disappointing but I don't know how much I wanted it to be all new in the first place.If you've ever played an Animal Crossing game before, you'll probably have noticed by now that all this great stuff is exactly the same as it was back on the DS. Well, if you had that thought you are unfortunately quite correct. Despite being a great, solid game, City Folk features hardly anything new to the franchise. It's still fun, it's still packed with charm, but it's all exactly the same as we've seen before. So now I'll move on to the few things that are different about this game.Being a game on the Wii, new controls were a must. Thankfully Nintendo fully delivered here with some excellent, smooth, and convenient control schemes. You can use either the remote alone or with a nunchuk, but both control modes work very well. The nunchuk is basically for those who want to move with a control stick rather than by pointing your way on the screen, but even that feels surprisingly smooth and works very naturally. Pointing at an icon on the bottom of the screen, which is quick and convenient, can access any section of the game's menu. The best part about the new controls, though, is using the remote's control pad to equip items, which saves those precious few seconds every so often that previous games in the series wasted. There is also the option to swing the remote for fishing and catching bugs, which is pretty neat.The main difference in the game overall is probably the option to go to the city. Once you're finished working for Nook you can hitch a ride on the bus any time to head off to the city. When you arrive, the first thing you will probably notice is just how small it is. There is simply one main courtyard with about five buildings to go into, none of which feature anything incredibly interesting. Almost all the shops and attractions feature characters from Wild World that only came around occasionally, but now you can see them any time you want. There is also an auction house, which is really the only worthwhile diversion in the city. Unfortunately bidding is only open here every once in a while.City Folk also features some decent, simple, and smooth graphics. The character models, while revealing little detail, are very smooth and lively. The colors used on the environments are pretty vibrant and make it look nice. The great graphics are complemented by an ever-consistent frame rate that never falters and almost makes the DS game feel choppy in comparison.Those three differences aside, you basically have a Wii version of Wild World. But despite the fact that there is so little change, it's still a great game in itself. If you've already played an Animal Crossing game you're better off leaving this one alone, but if you've never played a game in the series before then this is the perfect place to start because it's truly the best Animal Crossing yet; the lack of change just earns it a lower score than its predecessors.Gamplay: 8.0Graphics: 8.5Sound: 9.0Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 8.0/10", "\"A lot of reviews have come from people who have been playing Animal Crossing on different consoles/handhelds for years.  This was my first time playing Animal Crossing, so the lack of updates or upgrades didn't affect me.This game - at first - was incredibly addictive.  It passed any Wii Game I had ever played - even Boom Blox.  The concept is so incredibly simple - a little town to run around in and do... ...just about whatever you want.  The graphics are cartoonish and cute, the controls are unbelievably easier - even better with a nunchuck attachment - and it's just good, clean, easy fun.  I got hooked on the commercials and rented it.  My wife thought it would be \"\"stupid.\"\"  Two days later I was buying the game per HER request!  Now our \"\"town\"\" has the new bridge, the water fountain, all kinds of good stuff.Unfortunately, Animal Crossing gets old kinda quick.  At first you'll find yourself building mental \"\"to do\"\" lists - there's always something else you want to do.  Then you start getting the furniture you want, you get your house upgraded all the way, you get the in-town shop to upgrade all the way, and suddenly you find yourself repeating the same tasks over and over again.  Fish, pick fruit, sell for \"\"bells\"\" (money), talk to AI characters, fish, pick fruit, etcetera.  After a while, it just gets monotonous.The nice thing about this is that Animal Crossing is built to work on a Calendar.  Certain events are planned throughout the year.  Some only happen once a year, others every few weeks or months, etc.  This is really nice if you have the time (and ambition) to jump onto AC once a day for twenty or thirty minutes.  Seasons in the game change, Major holidays are celebrated - it's really quite impressive how they built this.The only other downside is that it doesn't support simultaneous play over the same console.  Believe it or not, my wife and I were almost considering a second Wii so that we could play over the internet with each other!  The AI characters don't give you the comradery that you'd like to have - it's too artificial.  We had fun sending letters to each other, buying each other gifts, etc.  But we could never play at the same time and that was always a bummer.  If we had done the \"\"two Wii's\"\" technique, we'd have each had different towns, which wouldn't have been the same as working together to improve \"\"our\"\" town.  We ultimately decided not to bother.Animal Crossing: City Folk has the potential to entertain a family-full of people (apparently up to four people) for a very, very long time.  You won't get hours of play-time a day, but you'll get something different almost every day, and I think that builds value in the game.\"", "I have been playing ACWW on DS for almost a year now and have almost mastered it and have everything. I got a wii this year so I could do wii fit plus and get exercise....doctor approved and recommended. Anyway it is a blast and I use the game as a reward for exercise.It is about 75% like ACWW. Then man it takes off and has twice if not more things to do. If you are an ACWW player here are a few things that are different and so fun.1. You get to choose 1 of 4 houses to move in when you start.2. You get 4 characters all having own house (4 mortgages too)3. Many of the same animals from ACWW but they say different things.4. So far I have meet Pascal and he behaves differently5. Saharah also has different things for you to do.6. The town landscape is multi layers. Mine has canyons, cliffs, many lakes, 2 waterfalls, You still have Nook's, Ables, Civic Center, Museum in the town7. You take a bus to the city and there are many animals walking around to talk to, that is so fun. I'll not tell you all the shops but you will know some of the people there too.So far it has been a lot of fun and starting over is great, something to work at. It does let you move your house from the DS if you want to. I did not so do not know how that would look.I am an adult player and I simply love the game.", "\"The original Animal Crossing is wonderful. I bought it shortly after it came out (several years ago), and yet I still play it! I bought this new version, expecting the same core gameplay, updated for the Wii. Well, that's what I got. Only problem is, as other reviewers have said, there are very few updates. That wouldn't bother me so much, but what has been changed has been changed for the WORSE! Instead of the simple \"\"acre\"\" system from the first game, you now have to walk on a round \"\"globe\"\". Personally, it made me dizzy, and it also makes it hard to find things. Everything must be controlled with the Wii remote. To do something as simple as open the menu, you have to raise your arm, move the cursor, and click on something (where previously you could just push a button); while walking around, I had to keep my arm raised CONSTANTLY. Very tiring. But the worst of all is that you can no longer ask your neighbors for jobs, etc! THEY will approach YOU if they want something; if you talk to them more than once in a row, they get annoyed and start yelling at you. This makes it much harder to find things to do. Just to add insult to injury, they now make you water the flowers. That's right, you must water EVERY SINGLE FLOWER, EVERY DAY. Otherwise they turn brown.  After two days of watering flowers and hanging around, waiting for the villagers to ask me for something, I got bored out of my skull and went back to the GC Animal Crossing. I have never been happier. End of story.\"", "\"i was at a party a few  weeks ago, and my friend's sister (who is 34) dragged out her wii... and of course we all had to stop our online joys of playing halo reach  to play a CHILDISH game called \"\"Animal Crossing\"\"  to keep the peace etc...Honestly, i have to say this game alone  makes  everything negative said about how bad the wii is  even more true..i played this game for 10 minutes just to give it a chance (since it was a holiday party and all)  but, i have to say i felt like i was back in pre school its that lame this would make a cute little mini game to pass the time  when your drunk nothing more..  i went into another room to play macross on my friend's sega saturn and i loved every minute of that game  ( the classics never get old)first of all  on animal crossing the colors are too bright, the graphics are not next gen and  are TOO CUTE AND CUDDLY  for my tastes .... id rather play colecovision's smurf game than this  crapfest (that was and still is fun)..the online support is also a huge joke  its basically pathetic...ok, ill admit if you have little kids and you dont want them being exposed to games like the halo series, the killzone games, modern warfare etc...this will be perfect...animal crossing is the perfect example of games that cater to the soccer mom crowd.. or to people that know absoloutly nothing about video games period ..thats why they buy a wii and play lame games like this.how can anybody over 6 actually enjoy a game like this is anybodys guess?  if your an adult and you actually like this kind of game  seriously you need professional help  and, if your a guy  and your really get into this game  check to see if you still have a pair  also, im betting you  like music by justin bieber  but im not getting into that LOL  im not the only one that thinks like this...but the little nintendo \"\"wiiboys\"\" will get all stirred up i bet..oh well..im speaking my mind on this...  even mario is better than this kind of tripe..and that says alot because the mario character is played out anywaygo to any store and look at the wii area  half of the games are Kiddie games or watered down version of games for the real systems (playstation 3 xbox360 pc)animal crossing proves once again that Nintendo is really slipping no i take that back  HAS slipped...they USED to have  great games but  not any more, and its a damn shame..ive been a gamer since the atari 2600 days..and even  then games wernt this wimpy  PG kiddy fluff..  if the next wii contunues with tripe like rehashed mario titles and games like this ill pass on it again..\"", "I haven't played the previous installments, and I didn't even think about buying this game-I just wanted a good Wii game, so I bought it. It's really fun, like a different version of The Sims 2. You can interact with the animals and make them say stuff that make you laugh. You can also make your own designs (I made a D Generation X and a Rey Mysterio 619 shirt) and display them so the animals can start wearing them. Some of the animals are snotty and mean while others are sweet and cute. My favorite animals are wolves so far, but I'm still playing. The city is very small but fun, you can watch a *horrible* performance at the Marquee, you can buy furniture from Gracie Grace, the most expensive place in Animal Crossing. You can go to Crazy Redd's too, where sometimes he has pretty exclusive stuff but other times he just has rip-offs. You can get your hair done at Shampoodle, or get your fortune told at that fortune place. Overall, the game's fun.", "I bought Animal Crossing City Folk locally without having previously owned the gamecube Animal Crossing or Wild World, I was anxious to see what the hype was about. First thing I gotta say is that I am nowhere near disappointed with this game! At first glance it looks rather boring, you have a house,you fish,talk with neighbors, catch bugs, garden. and go shopping and a few other things. However once you start playing this game it will strangely hold your attention for a couple of hours easily, if not longer. I think what makes it so engaging is the fact that you do only what you want and when you want, and you are enabled to customize your town and house, in thousands of different options, to suit your own taste. The game is fun for all different kinds of people,  I can have, say, a lovely Victorian house and decor and my little brother can have all the cowboys, pirates and alien style house decor and clothing he pleases, while my little sister goes in for a more modern flare. This is really just a chill-you-out, relaxing sort of game. I actually know more adults that enjoy this game than children. Thats another great thing that applies to Animal Crossing is that there is absolutely no age limit to this game. I recommend this game to absolutely everyone!", "Nintendo's Animal Crossing series began with a good set of wings.  It was originally released for the Gamecube in 2002 and recently, just a couple of years ago, it came to the DS.  Animal Crossing City Folk brings the franchise to the Wii.  Unfortunately, there's really nothing here that separates it from the pack.  It was new and exciting on the Gamecube so there were few complaints.  The DS brought it to the handheld was far superior.  But City Folk has the hitch of being the third game.  The series isn't new anymore and by the time you get to the third game it's time to start upgrading things or doing them differently.  Especially when you're coming into a New Generation.Animal Crossing: City Folk is much like the previous outings.  You can transfer some of your data from the DS over, but it'll mostly be the things you've collected.  It won't be your home and everything else.  This sounds appealing but in truth, you're still going to have to build your way up.There are a lot of things to do in City Folk.  You can go fishing, pick vegetables, mingle with neighbors, decorate your home and go visit other towns that people are in.  You can interact with the denizens in Animal Crossing though it certainly isn't as fun or as interacting with friends via Wii Speak.  That's not all the Wii makes use out of.  You can use motion sensor controls to do such things as moving your character by pointing and clicking or by swinging the Wii remote to cast your fishing rod or swing your net.  This is well and good, but the motion sensor controls here feel like an after thought.For the most part you'll be shopping in Animal Crossing.  It's a simulation of real life.  You'll find that each and every day there's something new to do.  Animal Crossing, however, isn't one of those games that's really made for you to spend hours on at a time.  In fact, there will be times you'll find yourself simply spending a couple of minutes.  Maybe someone will ask you to get something for them or perhaps you can check out the store and see what there is to buy, but you'll find that for much of what it's worth, there's nothing to do in City Folk.  This was exactly why the game worked better on a handheld rather than the console.  Certainly there's a lot you can do in one day but there's very little that keeps you coming back to the game after you've already explored what there is.  And this is mainly because there's not much added to the game that you couldn't do in the DS or Gamecube games.  Even some of the dialog spoken by the characters is the exact same as before.  So if you've already got the Gamecube version or (even better) the DS version there's no real incentive to pick up City Folk.Obviously, the city is the big new addition.  It serves as mainly another shopping center to buy several things at.  It would've been nice to be able to live in the city or get into city life.  You can get into city life... to a certain extent by visiting places like the auction house or the comedy club but there's nothing too exciting about it.  In fact, the most fun you'll find yourself having in the game is outside the city or visiting friends.  It's a shame the city isn't more enticing or more alive.Animal Crossing has never been the greatest looking game.  In 2002 when it came to the Gamecube, it was revealed the game was originally in development for the Nintendo 64.  Those visuals haven't changed too much.  You'll find a couple of smoother textures but the point is, it looks almost exactly like the Gamecube game in 2002 and the DS game released in 2005.  So there hasn't even been a visual upgrade over the years.Arguably a game that uses many of the same trends tends to be a good thing.  It means it was doing something right before.  Animal Crossing certainly was.  However, there is such a thing as too much of the same thing.  There's so little new content in City Folk that the list price is asking for a bit too much and Wii Speak alone isn't worth picking it up for.  If you have played either Animal Crossing game before, the Wii game isn't going to give you too much more than what you've already got.  It might be enticing if you've never played Animal Crossing, but even then, Wild World on the DS is a better choice.  If Nintendo had added a lot more to City Folk or at least hammered down the list price it might've been more worthwhile.  City Folk certainly isn't bad, there's just not much point to picking it up if you've got the original Gamecube game or Wild World on the DS.", "Anyone who knows Animal Crossing knows  it's hard to really rate the game until you have played for a year or so, but I thought some people might like to hear some first impressions from a huge AC fan of the latest game!My BIG first impression---very little seems to have changed.  This game seems like a real cross between the Gamecube version and the DS  version, both of which used up many hours of my time! The setup of the city is a LOT like the Gamecube version.  The town have the same feel,with lots  of slopes and rivers and the same somewhat tiring to get around town plan.  Tom Nook, the Able sisters, Pelly, all are there in stores that look about the same.  Blathers is even MORE long winded, and it's just as long a routine to get a fossil identified.  It sounds  like I'm complaining, but I'm not really, it's the AC I know and love.  You have  to go through the same internship with Tom Nook,and do even the exact same tasks you always have,and the first payment on the house is even just the same amount!You DO get to pick your house, though,from four around town.  You don't share a house, and they aren't all in a square.  I picked a house on the beach, for easy fishing.I  bought a shovel and a fishing rod.  Shoveling up things is the same,fishing seems initially a little easier---and yes,my first fish was indeed a Sea Bass!The animals I visited all had furniture I recognized---modern black and white, cabin themes,etc.  The animals were also about half ones I've had before, including Ruby, who I think has been in every town I've virtually lived in!A few things I did  notice---the sound was noticably better.  One resident, Reuben, had a scary sort of voice, and it was really echoey and cool.  The tops for sale at Able's  and the designs on display were impressive---they looked a lot more detailed than previously.I know at some point I will be able to take a bus to the city---I haven't yet---and I know as I go along I will find a lot more changes (I hope) but for  now, I feel like I'm  returning to a town I know well.  I love Animal Crossing, and I will be happy even if there doesn't turn out to be much new.  If you love AC too, buy this.  If you have never tried AC, you are in for a treat---BUY IT!  If you didn't like the first 2 versions but thought this one might be different---well....maybe wait and see!", "I never had the opportunity to play the original Animal Crossing for Gamecube. So i decided to pick up this title for the Wii. There was so much hype and praise for this game, I thought it would be worthwhile. Really unless your a kid or yor playing with friends/family, this would not be a suitable game for you. I envisoned I would literally build a town and mold it into my own figment of my imagination. It turns out all you do is pay off the mortgage, help enhance the local museum, and improve your own lot. Other than that, it is merely repetitive tasks day in and day out. I really tried to give this game a chance but it never really got me too involved. A game would get my attention if I find myself indulged in it for several hours and enjoying it. this game failed to do so. I am by no means taking away from the other positive reviews but just saying that this game caters to a specific audience which is really kids and friends/family. I would suggest you rent it first and try it out before you decide to truly own it.", "\"I missed the Gamecube US debut of AC, but I played through Wild World and loved it, for a while.  The thing about AC is how quickly you become addicted to it, then how quickly you burn out.  By connecting to other players' towns, you can quickly collect millions of bells you never earned, as well as all of the other fruits, and even some rare flowers if they're willing.  What this does is let you pay off your multiple mortgages almost instantly, which defeats the entire purpose of the game.  Once I had the biggest house, and the biggest store, there was nothing left to do except hunt for the UFO.  Now, Nintendo has basically rereleased the same game on Wii.  Sure they moved several NPC dealers to a separate screen i.e. \"\"the city\"\" but nothing has really changed.  You still need to trade annoying friend codes, you still need to coordinate multiplayer via a third party instant messager, cell phones, etc.  This game is great for players who have never stepped foot in the AC world before, which I guess is the majority of Nintendo's new expanded audience, but for the experienced player, avoid this until they actually do something new with the franchise.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.13964630663394928, 0.10443725436925888, 0.08092810213565826, 0.03537208214402199, 0.023324860259890556, 0.0757560133934021, 0.009028508327901363, 0.037941768765449524, 0.016044896095991135, 0.06812872737646103, 0.130991131067276, 0.06277720630168915, 0.08677858859300613, 0.026490213349461555, 0.005034151487052441, 0.09065201133489609, 0.006668149959295988]]}
