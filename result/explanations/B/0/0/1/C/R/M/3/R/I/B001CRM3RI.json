Now it's been released for the DS but don't let this version fool you. This game is just as fun, adult, criminal and addictive to play as the PS3 and Xbox 360 console versions.Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is an all new game based in Liberty City (Rockstar's version of NYC.) You play as Han, a young guy who just flew in to drop off an artifact for his father, the boss of a dangerous gang. He gets robbed, beat up, shot and dumped in the ocean. Of course, with your help, you break out of the car you were dumped in and see your uncle, who you will start working for. This is where the game begins as your main goal is to find out who ambushed you and who killed your father. I can say that Liberty City is huge and that would still be an understatement. Besides the main story missions, you have so much to do, it's crazy. The main thing of the game is to make money since you will need it to buy everything in this game.Most of the story missions earn you money once you complete them. You can buy property, cars, weapons and drugs. Along the way, you will unlock other activities to do on the side: meeting and completing side missions for random strangers, complete rampage missions, earn money as a cab driver, ambulance driver or a police officer, race around the city and destroy cameras so cops don't see you dealing drugs. Oh yes, you deal drugs in this game and this along has its own elaborate system. You can seek out drug dealers who will buy drugs from you or sell drugs to you. Each of them has different types of drugs and you find out certain drugs are preferred by certain dealers depending on which part of the city they are located. Buy drugs from those who sell it cheap and then sell it to those who really want to make the maximum profit. The cycle keeps going and if you find enough of them, they will send you emails telling you what they want or what they are selling.Oh yeah...you get emails in the game. You use a GPS-like device that shows you the map of Liberty City and as you discover all the side missions, drug dealers, racing destinations etc, they appear on the GPS in categories so save often so you can permanently record their locations. You get emails from your uncle at first that tell you when and where to start the missions. You eventually meet other people that work with your uncle and you get missions from them as well via email. As a bonus, when you beat all of the story missions, you can unlock a few more missions if you find two gold statues located in Liberty City. You'll need to sync your DS to Rockstar's Social Club website to unlock this feature. This game also features a multiplayer mode where you can take on other players in free for all, team based matches and races throughout the city. The only catch is you need to know other people that have this game and exchange friend codes.If there is one thing that I can say is a flaw is that the multiplayer modes are local based only. You have to have people next to you to sync up, exchange friend codes and play. None of these modes can be played online and I feel Rockstar dropped the ball hard. I know many people would love to play online matches with other people but can't because this isn't possible. You can upload your stats via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to the Social Club and if you register your friends, you can see their stats as well but that's as far as it goes.GTA: CW is a fun and addictive game that pulls no punches. You have lots of things to do in this game so this will take you a long while to achieve the \"\"100% completed\"\" status. This game is rated M so parents, THIS IS NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. This is for the players who are 17 years old and above. This game is violent, perverted and almost all of the characters in the game curse. Those who are 17 and over and are mature enough to see the fun and humor in this game will be the ones to get the best experience out of it.********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********\"", "\"Despite the positive reviews, I was skeptical that the Nintendo DS could handle a free-roaming game like Grand Theft Auto while still having a solid story. Sure, there were older GTA games for previous Nintendo consoles, but they were all pale imitations of the franchise's rebirth in Grand Theft Auto 3. Much to my surprise, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is not only a solid entry in the series, but is arguably one of the best GTA games to date.Using a new graphical style, GTA presents the story of Huang, a rich kid whose Triad boss father just died and who finds himself fighting his way through Liberty City's underworld as the Triads get ready to appoint a new leader. The game is as in-depth as any other entry in the series, with dozens of side missions, an engrossing plot, and all the variety in weapons and vehicles we've all come to expect out of the series. It also features some improvements, including a GPS to help you navigate through Liberty City and an option to let you replay missions after you're done with them (not to mention the \"\"Trip Skip\"\" feature, which lets you cut through the \"\"drive to X\"\" parts of said missions). The game is a real Grand Theft Auto game, as good as any that have appeared on the Playstation or X-Box.I only have two minor complaints about the game. First, although the touch screen features of the DS are utilized very well, the interface takes a bit of getting used to. Driving takes some practice, unless you don't mind ramming into buildings at random, and projectile weapons such as grenades are harder to use in combat because they require you to focus on the touch screen while your character on the upper screen might be getting shot at.The second complaint involves a spoiler about the ending, so if you want to avoid it, stop reading this review now.SPOILER SPACEMy other complaint - and this is quite nitpicky, mind you - is that it lacks one of the major plot elements that made entries into the series like Vice City so fun. In many of the other GTA games, you get to go from being a low-level criminal to a major crime boss. This game concludes right at the point where you can become a crime boss. While you do help Huang become a Triad leader, you don't get to really enjoy your time as a mover and shaker in the criminal underworld. Granted, there are some extra missions after the end credits, but they all retain the same type of feel as the missions from the rest of the game. This is in keeping with the spirit of Chinatown Wars, which is a more gritty entry into the GTA series, but I found myself really hoping that the game would have some more story after Huang becomes the Triad leader, allowing you to enjoy your criminal empire a bit. Ah well...maybe in a sequel.END SPOILERSAll of my complaints about this game are quite minor in the end. This is a huge game with many hours of fun to it. Most importantly, it is a worthy entry to the Grand Theft Auto series. One can only hope that we will see some more GTA games on the DS or 3DS in the future, because this is an excellent first outing.\"", "\"This is probably my favorite GTA game now, beating out all the others. Why you ask? GAMEPLAY! The touch screen is used so well in this game that it makes you feel like you are really part of the action. Getting emails, hot wiring cars, making molotov cocktails! Its all great! There is so much to do, taxi, vigilante, ambulance, fire truck missions are all here. This is not a watered down GTA game, it actually has more to do than other GTA games. The drug dealing side \"\"mini game\"\" is actually very addictive and fun. Traveling the city making the big $$$ while always on alert that the cops could bust you for selling or buying drugs with the many dealers around the city. One great thing they added was being able to fight back the cops while driving. If your being chased you can disable the cop cars by making them crash and it makes your wanted level get lowered! It really gives you a reason to run from the cops and try to take them out, which is a lot more fun and challenging than just hiding and waiting for your stars to go away. This is the real deal here, and the graphics are amazing to me, great cel shaded graphics that give the game a comic book feel while still running smoothly. Don't hesitate to pick up this work of art... it is more fun on the DS than the PSP because of the touch screen! Great for portable gamers all around.\"", "WARNING: This game is intended for adults since it features expletives, drug activity, and violent crime (one of the bosses cuts out someone's heart; not exactly for the faint of heart).The game is accompanied by a map of the entire city which is helpful for points of interest in the game.  The GPS featured in the game is less helpful for this.  The city is extensive with numerous building establishments, businesses, parks, tolls booths, clubs, stores for lottery scratch cards, gas stations, and even boating activity.The storyline is captivating where your character is following a time line of avenging his father's death, while assisting members of the 'organization' to win power struggles.  When on an assignment, you are directed to carry out missions which are quite elaborate - fighting, killing, protecting characters, rescuing and illicit pharmaceutical sales.Sound is good for a hand held platform with voices, sound effects, and music.  The soundtrack is original and adds to the ambiance of the game.  The graphics are detailed and there is a lot of attention to detail with regards to the surroundings.  You can interact with many of the items in one way or another.Game play is accomplished through the use of the keypad and buttons for navigation, fighting, and shooting.  The touchscreen is used to carry out tasks of hotwiring cars, vandalizing cars, making Molotov cocktails, accessing the PDA/email.  The interface is good but navigation with the cars are, at times, awkward since orientation changes frequently.  Vehicle physics is realistic with regards to large/small vehicles and boats.  It is quite unusual that you can run and catch up to a moving car on a freeway.  There is a shop where you can buy cars but you can carjack any vehicle that is slow enough for you to catch up with by running.  I find it unusual that police always try to harass me while driving my taxi (my main source of income in the game) - is it art imitating life? I don't know.  I also find it unusual that the walking police officers are always beating up citizens in the game (I don't know if this is a feature in preceding games of Grand Theft Auto but I thought it was odd).  Gameplay can be masochistic with Rampage mode where you destroy all gangsters vehicles with a flamethrower and burn your enemies.  You can set a bug to track your enemie's car or even set a bomb.  There are sexual references in the game, also.  This game has a lot of depth to the detail of tasks and characters with which you interact.  It will keep you occupied for a very long time.Fighting is facilitated with various weapons including your fist, guns, machine guns, Billy Clubs, crashing vehicles and Molotov Cocktails.What contributes to the realism is the ability to raise funds by working as a taxi driver, delivery person, pharmaceutical sales, working at a tattoo parlor, occasional robberies, and completing major tasks.  Money is so hard for me to come by, in the game, that I predominantly work as a fireman, taxi driver or sell downers/marijuana to 'dealers' (the cost of other pharmaceuticals is too much to pay for).This game can take many weeks to explore the various mini-games, missions and exploring.Overall, this is great game for adults in this role playing game.  It has excellent attention to detail and replay value.  This has to be one of the best games for the DS/DSi Platform.", "\"I was very skeptical before I played it, but was instantly won over within the first few missions.The controls (especially driving) are very clean and intuitive. The dialogue is mature, funny, and totally fits with the GTA series' mold. I really enjoyed the cutscenes - the comic-book style progression was way better than chunky animated scenes would have been.This is a great game - huge, not frustrating, funny, action-packed, and a steal at 40 bones.One last thing - an earlier reviewer commented on how this game is appropriate for teenagers. While it is a parents' decision, I would like to mention that the game prominently drops the \"\"f-bomb\"\", constantly references pornography, sex, and prostitution, and deals largely with drug use and distribution.Be ye warned.\"", "\"Chinatown Wars somehow manages to push the technology in the DS more than anything I've seen.  On top of that, the developer has managed to make one of the largest and most in depth games on the system as well.  I won't go so far as to say this is the best game on the DS, but I am nothing short of impressed.  This game isn't some attempt to make a quick buck... the developers went out of their way to do a great job.GRAPHICS: Fully 3-d environment with an amazing amount of detail all presented in cell shaded style.  You can even read many of the billboards and signs on the buildings even though the game is presented in a top-down perspective.  There is so much detail in the graphics I am constantly discovering new things every time I boot the game up.  My only major complaint about the graphics is that I think story-board presentation is flat, lifeless, and kind of ugly.SOUND: Sadly this game doesn't have the quality of sound that the big console versions have.  The funny, wacky radio stations with hours of dialogue are gone, but that isn't surprising since this is a DS game.  The sound that the game gives us is still pretty good though and above average for most DS games.CONTROLS: Probably the weakest part of this game, the controls are still very solid.  Driving a vehicle with the d-pad on the DS can cause a lot of fatigue, but that's more a problem with the DS than the controls themselves.  While running around on foot the camera sometimes gets positioned at a bad angle and requires re-centering constantly.  A moderate annoyance, honestly.  More annoying is the fact that I have trouble finding the \"\"sweet spot\"\" where you can hijack a vehicle, which sometimes results in me slowly walking around the vehicle pressing the button until my character climbs in.  Combat controls are pretty solid and the lock-on feature works very nicely.  In fact, the lock-on is almost a little to easy to use.  Selecting weapons and throwing weapons is kind of clunky and requires use of the stylus, but it still works.STORY: This is a standard Grand Theft Auto crime story with a lot of contrived elements.  You are a member of the Triad aspiring to avenge your father's death and uphold the family honor.  Entertaining and often humorous at times, but nothing amazing.GAMEPLAY: Lots of stuff to do in a huge city with three major islands.  The DS game has almost the level of depth of the preceding console versions.>> In addition to standard GTA style missions (travel here, do something, come back to hideout), the game offers many other distractions: scratch lotto cards, drug dealing, ambulance rescue, security camera destruction, insane jumps, buying property, and so on and so on.  The amount of stuff to do is almost overwhelming if you are a completionist.>> The game has a very enjoyable and solid driving and physics engine which emphasizes wild arcade driving action.>> Taxi system for those times when you don't want to actually take the time to drive to a location.  Helps eliminate some of the repetition you would otherwise experience in the game.>> Clever and intelligent use of the stylus for hot wiring cars, making Molotov cocktails, etc.>> Police chases are really fun and focus less on escape and instead emphasize disabling the police cruisers, a welcome change in the GTA formula.  Very fun.>> A mission replay feature is available in Chinatown wars.  I love this because in previous GTA games it wasn't possible to replay my favorite missions over after completing them.  It is a great feature that should have been in the previous games from day one.REPLAY VALUE: Game length is pretty hefty for a DS title.  Based on my current percentage of completion I expect about 12 to 16 hours of gameplay, but that is only if I were to plow straight through the missions and ignore all of the interesting stuff to do off the beaten path.  To get 100% completion I expect at I'll have to pour in at least 25 hours of gameplay, possibly much more... I can't really tell.  Multiplayer is present in this game with couple of modes, but I haven't tried any of them out yet.All in all, GTA: Chinatown Wars is one of the most full-featured games to be released on the DS.  I'd prefer to give the game only 4.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't allow half-stars I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and round up to a rare 5-star rating.  I highly recommend this mature-themed title to every fan of the GTA series or to anyone looking for a quality crime-themed action title.[NOTE: Be aware that my first copy of this game was defective, but the retailer was gracious enough to provide a working replacement free of charge and without any hassle.  I hope that my original faulty copy was the exception and not the rule.]\"", "This game amazing for the DS. There is so much added that it is unveliable. It really feels like GTA but with new features.PROS:GraphicsSoundControlsStoryCONS: That I have to stop playing because of the review.Last thing. I am an adult and this game is NOT FOR KIDS!!!! So parents, check first before you start buying the game and try to demand the company.", "\"I've been reading some reviews and I had to add my own thoughts.This game is an absolute victory for the Grand Theft Auto series.  There is so much that this game includes that it easily outshines the recent GTA IV on the gamut of modern generation gaming consoles.As far as story, it really doesn't change much from the way we all know our GTA games to act - you're an Asian kid who game to the US and is immediately drawn into a turf war between a few feuding gangs.  You end up fighting against all of them amidst the various characters and missions, and in the end... ...well, you'll just have to find out.What made the DS version successful and so crazily unique was the gameplay.  In recent GTA games we've started seeing the immersion of technology INTO the games.  Now we use cell phones to communicate, get missions, even take pictures and stalk targets.  In this game, we're given a full-fledged PDA which actually acts as the main menu of the game.  We can plot GPS routes, check email, and - in quite possible the greatest idea EVER in GTA-land, order \"\"Ammu-Nation\"\" weapons to be delivered directly to our safehouses.  Obviously the PDA inclusion is fine and all, but the fact that it actually FEELS like you're using the PDA with touch controls via your lower DS screen just makes it that much more fun.  From the lower screen you can instantly access different sections of your PDA, such as GPS navigation or email.  Also, the scrolling feature with your DS works as good as an iPhone - it is absolutely a joy to use.The game is viewed from a top-down screen position.  At first you feel like you're playing the original GTA series which debuted on PC in the late 90's.  This can cause a few issues, such as being shot at from a distance which you can't see, or when driving at high speeds with little time to react to traffic and turns.  It's a limitation for sure, but not of the game - for the fact that you're playing this game on a tiny hand-held gaming platform, it really makes sense.  And with the draw-distance limitation, they've added plenty of style to make up for the loss.  For example, NPC vehicles driving through town have working turn signals - I've ever seen a car with four-ways activated as the driver got out to investigate a pedestrian it just struck (and sadly, killed...)  You'll randomly encounter police chases, or even ambulances on way to a call.  You'll drive under subway tracks complete with random-generated subway cars passing overhead, or even be shadowed by the occasional flying helicopter.  It FEELS like a modern GTA game, just from a different perspective.And it just keeps getting better.  Borrowed from GTA IV are the \"\"random characters\"\" which you might notice on your map - triggers to random and often hilarious side-missions.  There are drug vans and Ammu-Nation vehicles to steal and pillage, unique stunt jumps to attempt (which are honestly increasingly difficult due to the top-down view,) and - thankfully back from the dead - garages in which to store you're \"\"hard-earned\"\" automotive possessions.  And of course the usual collectibles - this time in the form of surveillance cameras which must be destroyed with grenades or molotov cocktails - which this time you can make yourself!!I've been playing Chinatown Wars for well over 20 hours and still haven't finished the storyline.  That, for $30-$40 bucks is a win in itself.  That I've had so much fun during the whole process certainly seals the deal.  I hope to see more hand-held GTA games just like this one.\"", "Buy this game you will enjoy it!!! If you dont have this game, just buy it NOW!!!", "I honestly didn't know just what to expect upon hearing of the looming release of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars on the DS.  I had figured that there would be little to no chance of the game bearing any sort of resemblance to the franchise we all know and love.  Well, I was wrong.  Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a stunning achievement in every sense of the word, as the series' debut on the DS not only manages to retain nearly everything that made the series so great and revolutionary on home consoles, but in some cases even improves on them.  Taking place in Liberty City, Chinatown Wars finds you in the shoes of Huang, who is looking to avenge the death of his gangster father.  While the game provides a good story and memorable enough characters, Chinatown Wars also features the tried and true classic GTA gameplay, which is a surprise and an achievement in themselves in translating all of these features to the DS.  Translating the Liberty City from GTA IV is also brilliantly done, and there are tons of side missions and optional activities, along with two-player multiplayer modes; all of which will keep you busy for quite some time.  The game's graphics can appear occasionally grainy in some spots, but for the most part, achieving these kinds of visuals on the DS needs to be seen to be believed.  Chinatown Wars also makes great use of the touch screen and stylus features, and does so without over-complicating things as well.  All in all, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars isn't only the best third-party game to hit the DS yet, it is a stunning achievement that needs to be in the hands of every DS owner.  Even if you aren't that much of a GTA fan but you own a DS, Chinatown Wars is definitely worth playing at the very least, and stands as one of the best games available for the handheld.", "i saw a video of it on youtube, it looks like the ps1 gta, with cartoonish graphics, wanting voice over on this is like wanting pictures in your book, its easier, but i can read, i love cartoonish violence why does it have to look real, it still has the basics drugs sex money just you get a top 2D view of it, i agree its different, from a top view, and everyone looks like ants, i think we should try something different once in a while.", "This is one of the best PSP titles. Lots of fun, and a unique twist of the GTA series. Very highly recommended!", "\"The Good: Looks amazing, new additions are welcomed, smooth controlsThe Bad: Short, no voice actingA[...] `ol GTA on the PSP once again. We had two great outings so far with Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories which were you're standard traditional GTA games that were executed almost flawlessly. Chinatown Wars is a great treat because it is not a \"\"mini\"\" version of past console GTA games, but the first top down GTA game since GTA2, but this time it doesn't suck.There are a lot of new elements in Wars, but we'll get to that eventually. You play as a Chinese guy (instead of all those Italians and that one black guy...) named Huang who is supposed to deliver a sword to his dead dad's boss so his uncle can become the new leader of the triad. It turns out the sword gets stolen and you are on a wild goose chase to find it. Like previous GTA games this one's story has great plot twists all the way to the very last mission and it will keep you playing for hours. Since this was a port from the DS there is no voice acting, but drawn panels with written dialogue which is just fine for this type of game.If you're thinking  top down GTA hinders game play you're dead wrong. The controls are so smooth and easy to use. Unfortunately, lock on targeting is still an issue, but everything you love in a GTA game is here plus some. You can sprint, jump, shoot, toss grenades all in you're criminally intent glory. Controlling the cars in this game is sweet and smooth (unlike GTA4) and they turn without a fuss. You can shoot from your car, or pretty much anywhere.The GPS system is similar to GTA4's with the lines telling you the best route to your destination, and using cabs can get you there faster. One thing that you can't do, however, is use cabs during a mission so you are forced to drive yourself which is fine. Missions vary from escorting, to shooting people up, to blowing things up and so on just like in other GTA games. Wars has a great variety of missions from using boats to homing in on wireless signals, so you never feel bored.One disappointment is that you don't get your huge income from completing missions. You get it from dealing drugs. Yeah, it's  new element and not one that's warmly welcomed. You can deal anything from weed to heroine to coke, but you have find these dealers from tip offs you receive in your email. Some times you even get rewarded with drugs on missions instead of cash, and lots of times nothing at all.You're going to need lots of green if you want weapons, especially through the express order from your phone feature. Having it delivered can be a bit tedious, but it works. You can also hijack certain vans for drugs and ammo if you're low on cash as well.One of the most noticeable additions are the mini-games there were carried over from the DS. Anywhere from attaching a bomb, to opening a panel in a car, to rummaging through trash for guns, and assembling a sniper rifle has some pretty fun and interesting mini-games. These don't hinder game play, but make you feel more involved in minute details which has always been missing in previous GTA games. Another great additions is how you shake off cops. You get your wanted level then underneath are icons of cop cars, and if you make them crash hard they disappear and it lowers your wanted level. Each level adds a car so getting 15 cars to crash can take a long time.The game also looks amazing and has a cell shaded style in terms of graphics, but the game is still full of life. This is probably one of the best looking PSP games out right now, and this includes no load times. Chinatown Wars is superior to the DS version, and may also be a reason to buy a PSP if you haven't already. The game is short for GTA standards, so if you just do the main missions you can beat the game in less than 10 hours.\"", "Bought this for my little brother in law who loves everything I do, including GTA.He was always in my hair and a little annoying as many 11 year olds are so I decided to buy him this and he loves it! More importantly I can play my games in peace! lolAnd don't worry his mom lets him play rated &#34;M&#34; games, so before you go lecturing or judging just know he was going to play these types of games anyway.", "This plays almost absolutely nothing like modern GTA titles, in fact it sort of goes back to it's roots, when the series was known as a top down driving game. This is kind of a disappointment, because I never appreciated the series back then. Once the game went 3D free-roam, was when I got hooked.Don't get me wrong, the game isn't horrible, but it's not what I expect from a GTA game, and is the least impressive GTA game on the PSP. It lacks 3D free roam, and real radio stations(All of which were available in the previous 2 GTA stories games)However, I should also state that if you absolutely MUST get this title, then the PSP version is the best one to get. It looks better than other console versions, and plays much smoother.Bottom line, get this ONLY if you enjoy the original GTA games, but if DO enjoy those titles, then you will be pleasantly surprised with this game.", "There is not very much I can say about this game that other reviewers have not already said. This game is obviously well thought out. It is amazingly full of detail. The developers managed to squeeze all of Liberty City into such a tiny cartridge, and they did it with flair. The city is bustling with life.Unlike console versions of GTA where raids and stake-outs are large scale, with 20 characters shooting at you all at once, the developers of this game kept in mind that this a hand held and they scaled down these battles as well. This is a plus since trying to take out 20 or so gangsters on the DS might have felt a bit overwhelming.This game takes good advantage of the DS touch screen. It's use is seamless and it is used in interesting ways like scratch cards, digging in dumpsters, hot-wiring cars, selling drugs, and more. The use of the touch screen takes the customary GTA tasks and makes them interactive. This is another plus because it makes you feel that much more involved in the game.The only tiffs I have with China Town Wars are that the radio stations don't have any of the funny dialogue or any recognizable songs - this is understandable, and doesn't take anything away from the game at all - and that the graphics of the story scenes are kind of ugly, luckily the dialogue is just as off beat and funny as the console versions. These things weren't big enough cons for me to take any stars away from my rating.Overall, I am very happy to have bought this game. It is a great addition to the collection of any GTA fan, and the best adult DS game that I have seen so far. Every time I turn it on I find out something new. This game is definitely worth owning, even for those who are not the biggest GTA fans. This game will not disappoint.", "Not only did they capture the console experience, they refined it in a lot of ways. From saving your progress on the fly to much more varied side missions. And each use of the touch screen is better than the last. Hot wiring cars and disarming bombs are involving and never tedious. My absolute favorite ds game.", "\"Who can doubt Rockstar Games passion for making genuine, full fledged games, no matter what system? I will admittinly come out and say that origonally, I had my doubts. \"\"A full Grand Theft Auto title on the DS? No way\"\". Rockstar proved me wrong. Big time.Chinatown Wars, despite the Ds' less than impressive graphics and horsepower, delievers an innovative GTA expeince through the touch screen. The controls stick straight to the directional pad and the right-side buttons, but the touch screen comes into play by minigames.If your busting a car window, defusing a bomb, or pimp-slapping a hooker, swiping and tapping the screen will get the job done perfectly.Violence hasnt been a strong staple for GTA in the past. CW falls into the classic bland GTA combat system. Gunplay is simple: lock on and shoot. That's it, the whole mechanic of fighting feels static and janky, it's just standing and shooting. There's no real depth to the combat, so any confrentation felt unwanted, tacky, and not enjoyable at all. The fun illegal actvity is being a drug lord. CW's story revolves around you doing the dirty work for the kingpins, while gaining honor back to your family name. You control Haung, the only sensible character in a crazy world full of the zanny GTA style cast. Inbetween missions of your cartel, you can be, guess what? A Dope boy. Haung hustles drugs off on the sidelines in the passing period between missions. Depending on the drug economy, prices will alter on what's the best deal.CW reverts back to the traditional top down views from GTA and GTA 2. Using a more artsy form, Rockstar gives a stylized version of the Liberty City you grew to know in GTA 4, you may recognize some localations, rehashed in a fresh new light.CW is a full fledged GTA experience, and Rockstar used the DS' funtionality to deliever a must play game that surely will hold it's own aginast the DS hardcore titles.\"", "Holy cow where to start?!?! This is absolutely a BIG game for such a little handheld gaming device because rockstar certainly did not half ass this game. I was able to clock in about 40 plus hours of this game just by getting 95% completion since there is alot to do after you beat it but if you are look for a unique fun game for the little Nintendo handheld that could then buy this!", "Okay, this isn't the best game ever. There are issues with driving and the radio is crap.But there is no question, if you are eighteen or older and own a DS/DSi/3DS then you need Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. You need this to flesh out your system. It has the large world of Liberty City to explore with enough weapons, vehicles, and secrets to keep you going. The drug trade minigame is entertaining enough and the main system for income. The missions are challenging (Especially when the racing missions appear) but most of them are not impossible.The dark humor of GTA is present and a refreshing development. The theme is dark but not heavy, and the comedy is funny enough to make you smirk.The graphics are great for DS. The music is not. The sound effects for traffic, people shouting, guns firing, and ect are perfect. The controls work well for walking but not so much for driving.I'd give this a solid 8.5/10 for being one of the best DS games to exist and one of the few open world games on the DS ever!", "When this was first announced I was a bit skeptical given the DS's limited power. I enjoyed the PSP's GTA games but I couldn't imagine something this great on the DS. First of all it's amazing how they managed to put all of GTA IV's Liberty City on a tiny DS cartridge. Even though it returns to the top down view of the early GTAs, it's still a blast to play. The combat is fun but not really challenging since the auto aim system makes it easy to aim and take out your targets. I also like the new cop evasion system that that allows you to loose your wanted level by disabling the cop cars. Oh and her parents just because this is on the DS which is usually a child friendly system does not mean this is kid friendly, this game has everything that gave the console GTAs an M-rating. There's graphic violence(although cartoony) including violence against police, frequent profanity, drugs, and explicit sexual references. Do not buy this for your child if you don't feel comfortable with them being exposed to the above things."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03546815738081932, 0.0284604299813509, 0.054578378796577454, 0.0775688961148262, 0.05217389017343521, 0.017272289842367172, 0.055896859616041183, 0.030066195875406265, 0.054868463426828384, 0.03915614262223244, 0.053123485296964645, 0.05999591574072838, 0.0185835100710392, 0.059022270143032074, 0.06327390670776367, 0.062324002385139465, 0.0637274831533432, 0.03108031116425991, 0.02964399941265583, 0.05130815878510475, 0.062407299876213074]]}
