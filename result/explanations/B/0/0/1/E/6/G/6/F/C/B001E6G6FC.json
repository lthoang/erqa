"], "reviews": ["Wahl makes good/excellent products. My husband is a slave to their clippers. But I hated this dryer the moment I turned it on. The button placement is awful and it is way too easy to blast your hair with an unwanted dose of heat. Not only is that damaging but um, it frickin' hurts! Also, there are no attachments included besides the lovely condition cartridge and it brings with it such a heavy smell that it soon sat unused as I finished drying my hair without it.The only time the dryer performed as asked was with the help of a round brush and my own products to prevent heat damage. Not recommended at all.", "I decided to use this dryer for a few times before I reviewed it. I've had it now for almost a month and I personally haven't seen any difference in my hair after using it. I usually use Nexxus products so I haven't seen the benefit of the cartridge. The cartridge says its suppose to last for 30 drys but that's an overestimate and they are very pricey once they are done.The dryer in itself a very nice dryer. It's very powerful and easy to use and is very easy to use. It's a little expensive though for a dryer but I gave it three stars because of the simplicity of use.", "The Healthy Infusions Wahl Pro Dryer has a powerful airflow and the typical heat settings on most common blow-dryers.  It is a little heavier and louder than most conventional dryers but it feels sturdy and fits comfortably while holding it. The conditioning cartridge seemed to get in the way since I use a brush to blow dry my hair.  I normally use some type of heat safe spray before drying or styling my hair, so I decided to just try drying it with no styling products in my hair. The conditioning strip left my hair feeling stiff and heavy.  I quickly washed my hair again and dried it without the conditioning strip and used my regular styling products and my hair came feeling and looking much, much better.  I do have coarse, thick hair so maybe it would work better for individuals with fine hair.  I will continue to use this dryer but without the conditioning strips.  The whole concept of a conditioning blow-dryer is great but I think Wahl needs to do some more fine tuning before this becomes the beauty invention of the decade.", "I thought this hair dryer was going to be heavier but it wasn't which is a plus considering it takes me about an hour to dry my hair. I tried the dryer with the conditioning strips and it did feel smooth and silky but don't be fooled -repeated heat will cause damage to your hair and eventually compromise the cuticle which leads to split ends and fly aways.", "I was a little skeptical at first thinking that the conditioning feature of the Healthy Infusions Dryer might just be a gimmick.  However, upon the first uses of my dryer, I noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my hair.  Normally, I used to use a moisturizing shampoo and quite a lot of conditioner.  I was told by my stylist that so much conditioner could actually begin to build-up on my hair.  So, I stopped using so much but then started to notice my hair seemed really dry and having quite a bit of static.  This was especially true during the colder months.  It got to where I hated to even use a hair dryer because I felt like I was damaging my hair and making my fly-away hair even worse.Now, I have the Wahl and have been using the moisturizing conditioner.  I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair anymore.  I feel as if I am actually doing something good for it.  My hair looks and feels better than ever before.I would like to offer a suggestion, especially to those with shorter hair.  The comb feature can seem awkward at first, however, if you use another comb or brush to pull sections of your hair against the movement of the dryer, it will actually help lift the hair into the comb.  This is the same kind of effect as if you have someone helping dry your hair; imagine someone pulling one section taught while combing the dryer through.There are 3 different types of conditioner available:  Smoothing, Extra Body, and Moisturizing.  The cost is minimal for the cartridges.  I paid $6 at a local supply store.  You get two cartridges in each pack and that is supposed to be good for a couple of months.The dryer itself is surprisingly light weight and powerful.  It has a nice long cord.  The combs are detachable so that after you've run the conditioner through, you can remove it and continue drying.  It has 2 speed settings, 3 heat settings and a cool setting.I think it's a great buy for an individual.  I'm not a stylist, but this looks comparable to dryers I have seen them use.", "\"Overall this is a very good blowdryer.Its positives include a sturdy feel, plenty of power (1,875 watts), a nice finish and easy to use switches.  There are 3 heat settings and two speeds, as well as a 'cool shot' button.  The dryer also features tourmaline ionic technology.  This is the 3rd dryer I've had with this feature and it does help to minimize frizz.  On this dryer, like most, its automatic.  I do have another product which lets you turn the ionic feature on and off, so I've done comparisons on that dryer - the ionic technology does work!One nice surprise on this dryer is the rubber \"\"heel' which allows you to easily stand the dryer on its end when not in use.  You could also use the dryer while it is standing on this heel, although unless you need two hands free to style your hair and want to leave the dryer stationary you probably won't use this approach.  Still, it's a nice feature.On the downside, the unit was a little noisier than others in its class.  This could be because of the side openings for airflow.  It was not horribly loud, but its up there.  At 6', the cord length is, at best, average.The infusion feature on this dryer is supposed to let you condition while you dry.  To achieve this, the dryer includes an attachment which contains a comb and holds a conditioning cartridge.  The cartridge contents are solid and break down when heated.  In order for the conditioner to be distributed, you must make sure to start the dryer on 'high\"\" with the cartridge inserted.  Once you've blown over your entire head, you can set the dryer lower and continue to style as usual.  I did not find that the conditioner worked that well.  I came away feeling like I had something in my hair, rather than it feeling clean and just styled.  I tried different temperatures and settings, but I'm not too impressed by the conditioning attachment.The cartridges are rated to last up to 30 uses.  Refills appear to be pricy, costing a few dollars each.If I were to rate this dryer as a conditioning 'infuser\"\" I do not think this product was worth the value in that regard.  However, strictly as a blow dryer, it performs as well as other pro grade dryers I've owned and was priced accordingly, so I would rate it 4 starts....all in all it would be a good purchase - just don't purchase it if your sole intent is for the conditioning feature.Wahl makes quality products and this one is no exception, but the infusion seems more gimmick than functional feature.\"", "You can't go wrong with this hair dryer.  The quality of the materials used can be felt as soon as you pick it up.  It has a nice sturdy feel to it, but is not heavy at all.There are 3 different heat settings, (cool, warm, hot) which is a very useful function.  Sometimes it just gets too hot when you are blow drying your hair, and need some cool air constantly.  No need to always depress a button to get cool air.The dryer is very powerful and blow dries hair and other stuff fast with the high setting on.I even used this to dry my puppy after a bath.  The cool setting is especially great since it doesn't make him overly hot or dry out his skin.The conditioning cartridges last up to 20 times, and is the selling point of the dryer..but I didn't notice much of a difference using those and conditioner in the shower.  It does take a bit of time before you can use the conditioner attachment as it needs to be heat up first, so don't expect to just pop it in and use it if you are in a rush.It's a little pricey, but you do get quite a lot of features with it compared to a standard dryer.  I highly recommend this product.", "The blow dryer itself is good but I am not sure I would use the conditioner part again. I don't care for the smell and I don't feel it did much for my hair. The dryer itself works very well and has enough power with 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings. I would recommend the dryer just not the conditioner add on.", "\"The lightweight nature of the Wahl Pro Dryer made it instantly appealing. I recently tinkered with theInfiniti by Conair 224 1875 Watt Professional Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Stylerand it was excruciatingly heavy (the dryer alone!) -- my arms ached after five minutes! This was a much welcome change. Moreover, the ergonomic construction of the dryer allows for comfortable usage. So, the dryer alone is extraordinarily comfortable and effective. However, I wish the Health Infusions included two features that Conair does well: 1.) a retractable cord (which makes life so easy!) and 2.) easy access to the fan area for safe and easy cleaning. This aside, great dryer.Now for the attachments: Wahl decided to forgo the usual diffuser and concentrator attachments in lieu of a comb/conditioner one. Now, I found the comb too thick to comfortably maneuver through my hair (which is a standard thickness and fairly long) ... it skimmed the surface rather than actually \"\"combed.\"\" Likewise, the optional conditioning cartridge is problematic. As noted by another reviewer, the ingredients listed are not the healthiest choices. And, while it does produce some shine, the same results can be achieved with your own everyday products. And, as a final note, I'm not crazy about new beauty tools which require constant \"\"refills.\"\" (Ergg, while I'm making my shopping list I'll just add conditioning cartridges to \"\"replacement tips for my Zeno and a new brush for my Sonicare\"\"! Haaaa!). But my real concern is for how long will these conditioning cartridges be available? A year? Then what? Your Healthy Infusions just became a pretty expensive run-of-the-mill hairdryer.If you are considering this product because of the conditioning cartridge and you are willing to risk that they'll be pulled from stores within the year, I say buy it! (Hey, I am frequently sold on gimmicky stuff too ... totally guilty!) But if what you want is a comfy hairdryer, then considerRemington D-2009 T Studio Collection Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryerwhich simply does its job and does it well.\"", "\"This blow dryer includes the \"\"moisturizing\"\" conditioning strip (there are 2 others that you can buy, it comes with green for moisturizing.) You basically attach the strip to the front of the dryer like you would any other diffuser attachment.  The instructions say to run the dryer through your hair with the strip to have the conditioner deposited throughout your hair.  This was what I found to be awkward.  To follow the instructions you had to use the blow dryer as some sort of brush and if you are someone who regularly blow dries their hair with a round brush or paddle brush to achieve a style, this definitely gets in the way and takes much longer.  I finished my blow dry treating the attachment as a diffuser rather than a comb and styled as usual.  On the upside, the blow dryer is pretty powerful, average weight with a nice design and easy to handle when the attachment is removed.  I did notice my hair had less frizzies than normal after the blow dry, so that may be a testament to the conditioning strip.  I did not notice that my hair was weighed down or felt heavy like I do with some other leave-in conditioners.  Overall, better than just 3 stars, but the awkward attachment keeps it from hitting a 4 star mark.\"", "\"I couldn't believe this once it arrived!Pros:Fastest dryer I have triedNo smell after the first few uses (you know that smell of the coil's getting hot???)Small and CompactComb Attachment3 Heat SettingsCool ShotHas a stand for \"\"Hands Free\"\" operation!Cons:NONE!I would definitely buy this for $50! It is a win-win for any buyer!\"", "UPDATE 10/5/08 -- After a couple of weeks of using this dryer (without the cartridge) I can't stand it anymore.  It's really loud and not built to withstand its own power, so the vibration is horribly uncomfortable.  I've broken down and bought another Elchim dryer (non-ionic, old-fashioned variety).  I had one for six years or so before it broke and it's gotten nothing but five-star reviews on Amazon.  It got my hair dry quickly and smoothly, and it was quiet.  Skip this one and spend the extra thirty or so to get a good dryer.--------------------------------------------------------------------There's nothing wrong with the basic functions of this unit, although it's heavy and doesn't come with any normal attachments for directing airflow.  The power is good and strong and it has the usual complement of settings -- two speed settings and three temperature settings, plus a cool shot button.  You can get these for half the price, or spend more than this one costs to get a dryer that is lighter and more powerful.  Either of these would be better options, because what you pay for with this unit is the conditioner dispensing cartridge, which contains a conditioner that is solid when cool but liquifies when wet.  What the manufacturer doesn't tell you upfront is what is in the conditioner, and it isn't anything I would ever put on my head.CETEARETH-30, the main ingredient after water, has moderate high to high toxicity per the Environmental Working Group's Cosmetic Safety Database (the exact risk depends on how much is in the product).  The cartridge also contains squalane, which is derived from shark livers, collagen (which comes from young cows and is a common allergen), chitosan (which is derived from the shells of shrimp and other sea crustaceans), paraffin (i.e., mineral oil, a petroleum by-product), keratin (derived from wool) and fragrance, among other ingredients.  Why any of these ingredients are supposed to be an advantage isn't clear, nor can I find any suggestion anywhere that dispensing conditioner in this way has any advantage over conditioning your hair normally before blow-drying or using a product made for styling.  And with either of the latter, you would be able to use your own brush or comb rather than the comb attachment for this dryer which isn't close-toothed enough to hold fine hair anyway.Two stars because the dryer works, but a cheaper tourmaline dryer would work just as well and a more expensive one would be lighter and have more bells and whistles that actually do something.", "I've used many Wahl products over the years and they are always top quality, excellent both for professional use and the home user. This blow dryer is no different. Airflow is superb, heat distribution excellent and form follows function.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the hair conditioning attachment. I don't really see it being of much use and it's actually a little awkward. But overall, I give Wahl credit for always being innovators, even if in this instance, the idea doesn't quite work for me.Overall, a great blow dryer, but then, you really can't go wrong with anything Wahl makes. They're one of the few, if not only, widely commercially available styling product lines used in Salons by professionals, as well as at home by average consumers.", "\"First of all I want to talk about hair dryers in general.  I bought a hair dryer in 1995.  Finally had to replace it last year.  Hair dryers are generally long-term items that you buy once and hang on to for a long time, unless there's some significant feature you want on a newer model.Now Wahl is trying to make hair dryers provide continuous benefits to their bottom line, by inventing a cartridge containing a solid conditioner that you use up over time...so you buy more...and they keep making money off the same old hair dryer.  In the first place this kind of tactic really irritates me.  It's just a gimmick.  And secondly, I'd surmise that most people are happy with their own hair care products and don't need to add another layer of conditioner on their hair or to spend more money on a further product).Today I had the chance to use the dryer and I chose not to use the conditioning strip, e.g., as a plain old hair dryer.  (Yes, you can use it without the conditioning strip:  but then why would anyone buy this model?)  I washed my hair and used the dryer on it.  It was a fairly standard hair dryer, nothing out of the ordinary.  Choose from high or low air flow; choose from hot or warm air.  Really nothing extraordinary about it at all, quite satisfactory as dryers go.The conditioner comes as a solid block of stuff inside a plastic comb attachment that clips onto the opening of the front nozzle.  The hot air melts the conditioner and then it runs out onto the comb and you comb it through your hair.  Part of the reason I didn't use the conditioner is that I don't \"\"style\"\" my hair while blow-drying.  I just shoot air all over my head in a random pattern (sometimes upside-down) which gives my hair a lot of volume and root lift, and then I straighten it afterwards if desired.According to the pamphlet you can get about 20 uses from the conditioning pack.  But I'm quite happy with my regular (in-shower) conditioner, so I won't be using this to add even more conditioner to my hair.On the whole it's a quite satisfactory device for use without the conditioning block, but I will stick with my Babyliss Ceramic Pro X which gets hotter and blows more violently without making much more noise.\"", "Reasonably priced and really effective describe this dryer.  Actually, more than reasonably priced considering that some other Tourmaline Ceramic  dryer brands cost two and three times as much.Nonetheless, a savings isn't worth it if the product isn't good, and this dryer is fine.  My hair is quite short so my drying time is brief, and I have no need of the dryer's stand-alone convenience.  I do like the hook for hanging, and the cool shot.Recommended.", "It was a little difficult to use.  I had a trouble getting the attachment attached.  Then, since the comb is horizontal across the opening it was awkward pulling it through your hair before it blows it away.  It did however make my hair feel and look great.  My hair has short layers which is the reason I think I had trouble. I feel it would be much easier to use if you have long hair. You are supposed to take the conditioning strip out of the attachment and cover it until you use it again.", "\"This blow dryer has more gimmicks than a food processor.  It has three heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and two speed settings.  There's a little button hat turns hot air into cool air (when you hold it for several seconds).  It's not the lightest of hair dryers so they invented a little stand so you can set it upright for hands-free drying (I don't know how anyone would use this).  The big sell here is the \"\"conditioning cartridge\"\" with options for `moisturizing', `smoothing' or `extra body'.  I have no idea what kind of `chemicals' are in it.  This is inserted into the conditioning cartridge which will have you pulling your hair out trying to \"\"fit it\"\" on the end of the dryer and when you try to \"\"pull it off\"\".  It is not user friendly.  Plus, I highly doubt the '30-day' cartridges do something any hair conditioner couldn't.  It's a gimmick and a rather troublesome one at that.  The comb attachment did allow me to dry my hair into a buzz cut or flat on the sides, but to be honest; I just blow it all over and let it fall where it does.  I suspect women with long hair might like the cool drying setting with the heavy, thick-toothed comb to prevent tangles, but you can do that with any dryer and a brush.  When I saw the feature called, \"\"ionic conditioning\"\" to `reduce static and deliver nutrients', I rolled my eyes.  It's a perfectly adequate hair dryer, but you don't need all these frilly, non user-friendly attachments.  This was a hard sell, especially with the price.  My advice is to go simple - like you probably already are.\"", "\"If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you'll love this hairdryer from Wahl.  With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce & Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.First off, the coolest thing about this dryer is that they've moved the air intake vents to both sides of the dryer.  I thought the dryer would try to suck my hair into the vents, but because the vents are so large and there are two, instead of the traditional single on other dryers, the suction is quite minimal and this dryer didn't try to eat my hair at all.  I love that they added a rubber \"\"stand\"\" where the old air intake is on traditional dryers, this makes this dryer super easy to leave in a standing up position, which is great when the end is hot and needs to cool down before storing away.  This feature is being marketed as a means for hands-free drying and for those with short hair, I'm sure this is a useful feature.  My hair is way too long to be dried in this hands-free fashion with this dryer.This dryer just feels great in your hand!  The weight is very evenly distributed throughout the length of the dryer and you can tell this is not some $10 dryer from some bargain store.As for the straightening comb, I find it completely useless.  The teeth in the comb are spaced too far apart to pull my fine hair taut.  Also, the coverage area of heat when the comb is attached is really small.  This would take a lifetime to straighten my long hair.I cannot really comment on the conditioning cartridge because I cannot tell a noticeable difference between when it is clamped into the unit and when it isn't, except that it stinks a little.  The advantage, however, is that you don't have to waste money on resupplying conditioning cartridges, since they appear to have no effect/little effect on the results.If you're looking for a great dryer, then try this one, but if you're buying it for the gadgets, I'd keep looking.\"", "If you want a blow dryer that works great and dries you hair quickly, this is it!  After having an old hair dryer for years, this dryer was a very welcome relief.  My hair which used to take forEVER to dry with my old dryer dried within a few minutes with this Healthy Infusions Dryer.However, I wasn't so sure about the conditioner cartridge with comb.  First, the comb was very awkward to use.  The way you have to angle it in order to comb your hair was unnatural and not the way I would normally comb my hair while drying it.  I really had a hard time combing my hair with this thing, and therefore it was difficult to get the conditioner in.I liked the smell of the conditioner and it went fine on my hair.  I'm not sure if I used too little conditioner, as I see some had difficulties with the conditioner being waxy, but it made my hair soft and shiny.I like it, but maybe something a little more user-friendly would make the comb attachment easier to use.", "\"I don't believe it but I love this hair dryer!Finding a hair dryer that I actually like has been hard.  With the Healthy Infusions by Wahl I actually may have found what I've been looking for.Pros:* Small and powerful- weighs less and is smaller than my old hair dryerbut still very powerful!* Easy to use controls- the heat controls are easy to use toggles that are easyto access without having to look at the handle* Rubber stand for \"\"hands free drying\"\"- I'm not so sure about the hands free drying part -- howeverthe stand dramatically decreases the size of it's footprint on thebathroom vanity (for those even shorter on bathroom real estatethere is a hook for hanging it on the wall)* Less frizz than my old hair dryer - my hair is very fine and straight.

I've had this hair dryer not for over 4 years and it still is doing a great job.  No smell, does not over heat and is still reliable...\"", "Let me start out by saying that I have a very expensive, very powerful blow dryer, and I was extremely apprehensive to even try this one out. I have fairly long thick, curly hair, and it's coarse to boot. I have had it straightened, but there's no way I can get away with not blowing it dry to keep it shiny with no frizz.My normal routine takes about 45 minutes. I have to divide my hair into sections, and hold each part taut with a circular (or flat) brush and keep rolling it as it dries, so it stays straight.  I was told that I should use high heat, and make sure that it's bone dry before I quit.Sooo, I took out this blow dryer and figured I would give it a try, and probably have to rewet my hair and start over.I didn't.Instead, it took me 15 minutes to blow dry my hair , and it would've taken 10 if I hadn't gone over each part again just to make sure. My hair feel smooth and looks straight, and I just had to use the medium setting as they suggested which is better for your hair.In the past, I have tried hair dryers with comb attachments, and they have been disastrous. All they've done is blow around the hair not in the comb, and not dry taut the hair that was. But this was different. The hair still blew a bit around the comb, but not much, and even though it didn't feel like it would, the comb was really able to keep the hair taut enough to dry straight and smooth.There were a few things to say as far as criticism -1) The comb attachment was hard to connect to the dryer - it took me a few minutes and I gave up trying to take it off. (I'm planning on keeping it attached anyway so no big deal for me.)2) The conditioner was okay, but a little gimmicky. I only used it for a few minutes, and decided that I didn't need it. Better to use your own, good conditioner and then blow dry using the comb alone.3) It's a little too easy to accidentally push the control buttons while holding and using the dryer, and I found that I kept having to put the speed back to high and the temperature to what I wanted.4) Using the comb attachment gets your hair very straight, so if you want any curl, you need to use something additional to curl the ends. (And if you want really silky, you may still want to add the use of a ceramic flat iron.)Normally, I would give less than a 5 star rating for something that had these problems, but on the whole, they are minor AND THIS DRYER REALLY WORKED. I am amazed.Highly recommended for those of you with hair like mine.", "This has a conditioning cartridge that is slipped into the comb attachment on the dryer and heats up when you turn the dryer on high.  I've tried the conditioner a few times and for me it's awkward trying to run the comb attachment through my hair, especially on the left side of my hair (I'm right handed).  I'm used to putting on a conditioner in the shower and I think I'll just stick with that.I have noticed that my hair feels and looks silkier and softer after using the dryer; I think that's because of the ionic technology, and that's definitely a plus.  To me the dryer is heavy and loud, but I like the option of standing it up on the counter so it takes up a lot less space.I would not recommend buying this dryer for the conditioning attachment, especially since after 10 to 30 times it needs to be replaced.  I will definitely continue to use this dryer but without the conditioning attachment on it."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0492500439286232, 0.04456903040409088, 0.03336024656891823, 0.05284235253930092, 0.05271856486797333, 0.036266181617975235, 0.05533212050795555, 0.05084735527634621, 0.029646124690771103, 0.05047895386815071, 0.05429980158805847, 0.04310763627290726, 0.04487571120262146, 0.04624383896589279, 0.05166275426745415, 0.05333802476525307, 0.04826470464468002, 0.035839442163705826, 0.04887407273054123, 0.031143564730882645, 0.03699992224574089, 0.050039518624544144]]}
