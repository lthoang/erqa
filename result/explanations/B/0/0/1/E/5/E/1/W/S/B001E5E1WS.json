"], "reviews": ["\"What an aesthetically designed tin. Nice outer lid, with an inner lid that opens and closes with a \"\"pop\"\" so you know it seals, but doesn't break your nails to remove it. The first thing for your senses is the delicate but fabulous aroma wafting up. A very pure jasmine unlike any of the more common jasmine teas that are for sale. Feel it with your fingers. Long, fine leaves. Almost twiggy as though you're feeling the real thing, before it's been processed into oblivion.Steep it following directions (or to taste) and sip...what a delight! Absolutely no bitterness, from initial taste to aftertaste. Just delicious. And I found the second cup steeped with the same tablespoon as satisfying as the first. A real test is to let it go cold. A lovely flavor hot or cold. If tea can be beautiful, Rishi's Organic Silver Needle Jasmine White Tea is a thing of beauty.\"", "The tea is of excellent quality and is packaged with great care.  I like it but I prefer the more bitter black or even green tea.  I adore the scent of jasmine in the air when I'm out walking and pass a flowering plant so I thought I might enjoy it in my tea too.  I don't dislike it, I just prefer unflavored green or black tea.", "\"This tea is so delicious, so fragrant, that for the first time, I choose to drink a hot tea without sweetener of any kind. I usually use honey or splenda, but they just destroyed the delicate essence of this lovely tea. It really is sweet and fragrant enough without any embellishment.I usually drink Numi teas. I have many varieties, and I love them. But this tea is especially lovely. From the long, thin white tea leaves to the jasmine blossom petals, what a treat for the eyes, nose, and palate. The fragrance hits you as soon as you open the container and lasts throughout the cup. I followed the directions and steeped the tea as suggested. The first cup was heavenly, the second brew delicious, but the third was a bit weak. It was never bitter, never harsh, and never \"\"too green.\"\"Yes, it's expensive, but it is organic, hand-picked, authentic, whole white tea leaves and whole jasmine petals. A little goes a long way. I guess it all comes down to what your passion is and what you can afford. I do hope I can afford this in the future, and I am tempted to try other varieties as i finish my Numi stash.\"", "\"Let me count the ways!  ;)First, I love the tins.  When you open it up, you KNOW you are getting tea that has been properly stored!  And I love the specific brewing instructions.  If you're going to do it - do it the right way!Second, the aroma wafting out of the opened tin is intoxicating.  I LOVE Jasmine tea - or at least I thought I did - but I've never tasted any as delicate yet flavorful as this one.Third, I love that you can get more than one serving from a spoonful of leaves.  It makes the fact that this tea is somewhat expensive \"\"easier to swallow\"\" if you will.And fourth, I love that this lovely beverage can stand on its own, no further accoutrement necessary - hot or iced it's just delicious on its own.I like to use a French press, which is probably totally unorthodox but it works very nicely to make a good cuppa for me.This tea definitely goes on my \"\"must have\"\" list of teas - which is quite long - but I think this will be at or near the top of the list from now on.\"", "I love Jasmine tea but always felt the aroma was oddly enough, overpowered by the tea.  This white tea coupled with the Jasmine flower is a perfect blend. I even just sniff the can sometimes.  Great brew.", "I love tea!!!  I also make it a point to buy organic products as much as possible.  I was really looking forward to trying this tea but found it disappointing.The jasmine is so strong that I found it overpowering.  I tried making it again using much less tea and steeping only briefly but the jasmine was still too strong.  I will not buy this product in the future.", "I love this tea!  I don't feel it is more expensive than other white teas because I get so many steepings from it that taste great.  Most other teas, I am lucky if I get 3 or 4 steepings with the 4th being weak.  I can re-steep these needles all day long and each steeping tastes as good as the first for me.  I useMedelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettleand often throw out the first steeping if I don't feel like caffeine that day as most caffeine goes into the first steeping whereas all the healthy benefits are evenly distributed throughout many steepings.  After heating the purified water to 185F in my Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle, I pour a little hot water into myPrimula Personal Glass Tea MugorTeas Etc 12-Ounce Glass Brew Mug with Glass Brew Basket and Lid, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons of Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea, add 185F water, and steep for 4-5 minutes.  If I want caffeine that day, I enjoy the first steep right away!  If I don't want caffeine that day or it is already evening or for whatever reason, I throw out the first steep and start my second steep right away for me to enjoy my first cup soon!  Also, sometimes instead of throwing out the first steep, I will save for cooking vegetables or other cooking as this tea adds delicious flavors and healthy benefits.  This is one of my favorite teas!All of Rishi's teas are gluten free and are processed in Milwaukee in a gluten free facility.", "When you open the can of this tea you can see that the quality is excellent, you can smell the jasmine fragrant instantly, the taste is smooth and soothing.Very good tasting.", "I really like the Rishi brand of teas and the Silver Needle Jasmine does not disappoint. It's a nice subtle tea that is good for mornings or evenings. I like Rishi's packaging and think that the tins of teas would be perfect in a gift basket -- I'd like to receive them as a gift!Also, it's nice that this tea is organic -- that's a big plus in my book.", "This is the best tea we have ever had hands down. Prior to receiving this, I didn't really think I liked tea. Upon trying this I knew I loved it; however, now having gone a bit deeper into the tea world (Teavana and others), I have still never found anything better than this.I wish that Rishi would still sell their tea in the tins.", "As soon as this tea arrived, I had to try a cup. The scent of jasmin  filled the air upon opening. The taste was just as delightful - pleasant, light, and relaxing.  I have enjoyed several cups on a chilly evening just before bedtime, but also in evening after returning from a stressful day at the office.  I would recommend this tea to those that enjoy a unique cup of tea, not the standard bag in a box.", "\"I would prefer if they didn't include the Jasmine flowers, the slightly flowery aroma doesn't appeal to me.  Otherwise this is an excellent tea.  The taste is good and as it says, it is not bitter.  The flavor is not really \"\"mild\"\". (some teas have tasted like warm water, this tea definitely has flavor and brews surprisingly dark)With this type of high quality tea, I do recommend following the brewing directions exactly (185 degree water, 4 to 5 minutes steep time).I use purified water to make this, and add some honey, a half dozen drops of lemon juice and a quarter teaspoon of vitamin C.  The result is excellent.\"", "This is one fragrant, flavorful tea. And it smells GREAT! Not just being brewed, but even in the tea tin it smelled so good it was amazing.Makes a great iced tea. Delicate and substantive.Lovely low notes, and a floral bouquet you won't believe. Well worth the cost.", "I read that tea is the only consumable that is not washed before it is packaged, so it is all the more important that it be organic. This tea is organic, and whole tea, so you get the best buds, not the leftover scraps that often go into teabags, and it tastes like it. You have to be careful to make it according to the instructions--too hot water or too long a steep will make the tea too astringent, but if you follow the instructions to the letter, you will be in bliss. The delicate hint of jasmine and the refined white tea flavor are for savoring, not gulping with General Tso's. So soothing and relaxing...ahhhhh--have some with your next bath!", "I am a big loose leaf tea drinker, although normally I drink green teas.  I love jasmine tea, so I was excited when I got to try this product through the Amazon Vine program.The tea is nicely packaged.  It comes with an outside seal as well as a metal insert that can be reused to keep the tea fresh.For each teaspoon of tea you use, you can get a couple steeps out of it.  I wouldn't use a teaspoon for more than a couple cups of tea though; it starts to get a bit weak.  Although, this is not Oolong tea, so I am impressed you can get a couple steeps out of it.The tea has a faint delicate jasmine odor to it.  I was impressed with how smooth the tea tasted.  There was no hint of bitterness and the tea rolls smoothly around your mouth and down your throat.  The hint of jasmine is perfect.  It is a subtle hint that I have come to associate with high quality teas; such as when I get hand rolled green tea jasmine pearls of tea.All in all I am very happy with this tea and would buy it again.  Some people have commented on the cost.  All I have to say is some of the loose leaf teas you buy at Teavana (especially their hand rolled green with jasmine) is much more expensive than this tea.  Additionally this is an organic tea, which probably costs more to produce.I have a little bit of trouble buying teas online because I like to see and smell them first.  Given the quality of this Rishi tea, I would be comfortable buying other Rishi teas online.A great tea!", "Has a pleasant, light, crisp, slightly sweet taste.  I used it in ice tea and it is quite refreshing.", "I have been a long-time fan of Rishi Tea.  They are a company that has a far superior product to most tea found on the market today.  For years, I have ordered excellent teas, handpicked most of the time, from specific regions where only the best of its kind can be grown.  This White Tea (called Silver Needle here) is the first blush, the very first tiny leaves to come out in the spring and they have exceptionally light and delicate flavor.  The Jasmine flowers mixed in are just in the right proportion.  I am not usually a fan of Jasmine Tea.  Normally the only thing you can taste or smell is the Jasmine overpowering your senses.  This is not the case with this tea.  The mix is masterfully blended to give enough Jasmine without overpowering the delicate taste of newly leafed tea.  I hope AMAZON.COM continues to offer these outstanding products from this special company.  I have never tasted a RISHI Tea that I didn't like.  Silver Needle Jasmine is no exception.  If you are looking for a special tea to enjoy on a cool night, this is the one.", "\"Simply thrilled with the ingredients:  100% organic white tealeaves, 100% organic jasmine flowers.  No \"\"natural\"\" flavors and whatnot!  This is a very mild tea with a perfumey taste due to the smell jasmine flowers.  Thankfully it is not overpowering.  Some jasmine teas make me think I'm drinking a bottle of perfume!I over brewed this (like 20 min) it tasted fine.  No bitterness.  The jasmine didn't become overpowering.  Because I overbrew, I don't reuse the tea, but you can if you brew it the recommend time of 4-5 min.  This makes the tea last that much longer!The leaves are packed right up to the top of the tin & they are beautiful!  Long & slightly twisted green colored leaves with white velvet fuzz on them.  No broken up little pieces that are almost dust that some tea companies like to call loose leave or full leaf.If you enjoy jasmine in your foods, you are sure to be pleased.  You can double your pleasure knowing you are consuming something clean, not loaded with pesticides & chemicals that are concentrated on non organic teas.  Who wants a \"\"nice\"\" cuppa chemicals?\"", "I brewed this with my automatic tea maker on the medium strong setting. The flavor is delightful. It is just perfect for white tea and the hint of jasmine adds a nice finishing note. Highly recommended for someone who likes white tea with a hint of flavor. Bonus this is organic and fair trade.", "\"Tea is a winter drink for me, so I decided to try this Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea offered on Vine. It came in a pretty and functional little double-capped canister and welcomed me with its rich herbal aroma. The leaves are \"\"withered\"\" and look quite unprocessed and natural. I followed the directions -- one tablespoon in my little tea ball, bring water to a rolling boil and then cool a bit, steep 5 minutes -- and brewed a cup to enjoy on a blustery cold afternoon instead of my usual coffee.Rishi imports tea that is certified organic and fair trade. The company was founded on a basis of social responsibility and sustainability, to offer consumers fine single variety teas direct from their origin. This white tea -- very low in caffeine and high in antioxidants -- originates in China's Fujian province and is infused with jasmine flowers for a subtle fragrant product. My cup of tea had a light, slightly floral flavor with no trace of harshness, and as directed by the package, I used the same tablespoon of tea to brew a second cup and enjoyed it just as much.I choose fair trade coffee whenever possible, but haven't explored the \"\"artisan tea\"\" world. This Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea is very appealing and I know I'll enjoy it -- and now I'm eager to try some of their other varieties. Produced organically and sustainably, it's not just a cup of tea but a link to ancient knowledge and traditions.Linda Bulger, 2008\"", "This tea is wonderful to enjoy in the late afternoon when you want something not too edgy.  The flavor is refreshing both as a warm cup (the scent in the air will make everyone around you jealous), and even over ice.", "\"Before reviewing this product, some background about white tea might be helpful. I've been a serious student of tea for a few years now, so my intention is not to be pompous but rather to share what I've learned so that you can enjoy your tea to its fullest potential.White tea is Chinese in origin, single-varietal, and the least processed of any tea. Once picked, it's allowed to dry naturally (preferably quickly, by sunlight) under careful observation--period. Because of this, it is extremely high in tea polyphenols and antioxidants, both of which are thought to contain health-promoting properties (it's believed by some that white tea is even more healthful than green). It tends to be rather delicate in flavor (depending on the grade) and has none of the grassy quality typically found in green teas (some find it easier on the stomach as well). The concept of merely drying the leaves has caught on because \"\"white\"\" tea is now being produced in other countries. And while the best of these are superb (Imperial Silver Tips from Darjeeling and Antler's d'Amour from Africa are personal favorites), they cannot in fact be considered true white tea, which must by definition be produced from Fujian's Da Bai Hao bush. I think of these other teas as \"\"white-processed\"\" rather than white.The best scented teas are not perfumed chemically; rather, tea is combined with fresh blossoms (jasmine in this case) and allowed to absorb the fragrance over the course of several days, with new blossoms being added over the course of the infusion period. This is the method by which Rishi's teas are scented.Now to be strictly accurate, Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea isn't Silver Needle (Yin Zhen), which consists only of buds and is the highest grade of white tea. There are a fair amount of leaves to be found which makes me think this is closer to Bai Mu Dan (Preferred Peony), the grade just below Silver Needles). Regardless, it's nice tea with a lovely jasmine aroma (BTW, the Chinese drink jasmine tea to relieve respiratory distress). What follows is the best way to enjoy it.White teas are usually brewed at lower temperatures that are similar to those used for green tea; however, the consensus among vendors seems to be that somewhat higher temperatures--185 - 190 F--are best for scented whites. I recommend halving Rishi's suggested brewing time and reducing the leaf a bit--2 teaspoons in 6 - 8 oz. of water for two or so minutes. Please take the time to warm your brewing vessel with boiling water, then heating the dry leaf in it covered for a minute or so after discarding the water used for warming. I also recommend brewing uncovered so that the tea doesn't \"\"cook.\"\" (I've prepared a video review of the Bodum Canteen that demonstrate this, but my friend's husband has yet to code it so that I can finally post it). You'll end up with three good infusions of the same leaf, after which it can be soaked covered in about 6 oz. of water overnight in the fridge for a nice, light beverage. A lot of bang for the buck!This is lovely tea, plus it comes in a reusable canister that's both practical and attractive. It's not as fine as my cherished Yin Zhu Silver Dragon Pearls (also white, not Rishi), nor do I like it as much as Rishi's green Dragon Pearls (which I reviewed some time ago, not for Vine), but I'm guessing that if bought on Amazon, it will be a good buy (it's unavailable at the time of this writing). In fact, I insist that my parents drink tea every day, and this is one I buy for them. Rishi carries some very good tea and this one is no exception. It's an excellent introduction to both jasmine and white tea, and the spiffy packaging makes it appropriate for gift-giving as well (in fact, it's the perfect size for a stocking-stuffer). Another very enjoyable Rishi offering.\"", "Are you an occasional tea drinker?  Do you buy the inexpensive off the shelf teas?  If so, don't try this tea because you'll never be happy with a tea bag again.  Rishi Silver Needle Jasmine Loose tea comes in a nice tin with an inner lid to keep the tea leaves fresh.  I opened the tin and immediately my nose was in heaven.  The jasmine scent was light and sweet and absolutely beautiful.  I practically skipped to the tea pot so I could heat the water.  I was making two cups so I measured two tablespoons of tea into the infuser and, after making sure the water was just the right temperature poured it through the leaves.  I allowed the tea to steep for 4 minutes and then poured the tea.  Once again my nose was in heaven and my mouth was not far behind.  The tea has a light, slightly fruity, jasmine flavor.  Because it is white tea it is not as tanic as other teas. It's smooth and soothing and refreshing. I can never go back to the off the shelf tea bags.  I can't wait to try other varieties of Rishi tea.", "I'll confess that I'm more of a coffee fan than a tea fan, but I do enjoy tea on occasion.  This Rishi Tea with a jasmine flavor/aroma is very nice.  After brewing for approximately five minutes in my cup, I sipped the tea and was immediately impressed by the jasmine fragrance.  At first taste, I was a bit surprised that the tea did not seem to be particularly strong even though I had brewed it according to the manufacturer's instructions, but after getting halfway through my cup I realized that the strength was just right for my taste.  I finished my first cup quickly and made another using the same leaves in a teaball and the second cup was just as good as the first -- mellow, slightly sweet, and very satisfying.  I would have made a third but I had to leave for work; the manufacturer indicates that a teaspoon can make several cups of tea.", "The first thing I noticed about this tea was the divine scent: flowery, but subtle.The canister is designed with an inner lid, and looks as if it will keep the tea super fresh for a very long time.Apparently, white tea has the least caffeine of the three types: black, with the most, green, with the next highest level, and white.  I happen to be sensitive to caffeine, so this was welcome news.  After having a cup that brewed for over five minutes I felt absolutely no buzz.For those of you who care about this sort of thing, white tea is known for having a very high level of antioxidants.Truly delicious and unique, it tasted  like a more complex version of jasmine tea.  There's a slightly dry after-taste, but it was pleasant and made me think it would be ideal paired with unctuous foods.In an experimental state of mind, I made myself an open-faced sandwich on German black bread (the whole grain kind) with herring-artichoke heart salad in a mustard dill dressing garnished with sliced avocado.  The tea was simply perfect with my lunch.  The dryish aftertaste complimented the richness of the herring and avocado.  It made me think this would be fantastic with sushi, and more interesting than the usual green tea offered in restaurants.For dessert I tried pairing it with two types of chocolate: Dagoba's lemon ginger (68% cacao) and Lindt's Excellence Madagascar (65% cacao).  The former was not such a successful match because the lemon competed with the jasmine; too much bitterness, I think.  But, Lindt's Madagascar was made for this tea.  The fruitiness of the chocolate against the floral flavors, and that dry finish as a counterpoint to the richness of the Lindt, was just heavenly.", "\"Yes, you are right.  This tea is expensive.  It is also quite marvelous.Right off the bat, I was impressed with the packaging of this tea.  The tea comes packed in the correct kind of tin, with both outer and inner tightly fitting lids.  When one pops out the inner lid, one is instantly rewarded with a waft of the wonderful scent of jasmine.  Ah..... Heaven.  Or, if not Heaven, at least a tropical garden at twilight.Now what's this? you might ask.  This doesn't smell like the jasmine tea from the local Chinese takeout place.  Yep.  It sure doesn't.  That's because this is The Real Deal.  This tea is made up of whole baby tea leaves (\"\"white tea\"\") and whole jasmine flowers.  No raggedy bits and pieces of leaves and twigs were to be found anywhere.  No jasmine \"\"flavoring.\"\"  No bitter aftertaste.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.....I carefully prepared the tea according to directions - one tablespoon of tea leaves per 8 oz. of water heated to 185 degrees.  The directions said to steep the tea from four to five minutes, which seemed excessive to me, as I didn't want bitter tea.  But in a real test, one must follow the directions, so I let the tea infuser sit in the water for a full five minutes.  And I was rewarded.  This is an utterly delightful tea, completely lacking the bitterness that can be associated with green teas.  This tea is wonderful \"\"as is\"\" - no sweetener or milk should be added, in my opinion.The directions also stated that one tablespoon can be steeped \"\"multiple times.\"\" Well, how many times is \"\"multiple?\"\"  Good question.  The first cup steeped was delightfully aromatic.  The second cup less so, but still good.  The third cup was rather pedestrian, the fourth cup just bland.  Not bitter, not awful, just bland.  I didn't try a fifth round of steeping.  This is a tea best suited for someone who is going to want more than one cup of tea within a fairly short time span - if that is you, you will find there is a lot of bang for the buck with this product.All in all, I find this tea to be just wonderful.\"", "I love Jasmine tea and the smell, this is a great tea and the fact that it's organic is even better. I would definitly purchase this!", "I was very excited to try this tea as I am a bit of a tea freak from green tea to the steeper oolong tea.  I loved the fresh fragrant of the tea and it did not have a bitter taste if the leaves are steeped too long.  Generous heap of tea and immediate off the boil water are a must to get the best out of the tea experience.  Also, i would confirm that you do need to allow the tea to brew for 5 minutes before drinking.  I normally like to steep the tea leaves several times, and in this case, I would suggest putting a few new leaves in.the tea leaves are neither diced nor sliced; and that I believe helps to keep the integrity of the flavor whole.  This is a genuinely good quality product.I am keen to buy this for family to try as some tea smells better than it taste; not the case of this rishi jasmine tea. This is going to great after a good meal to help with the digestion."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03256010264158249, 0.036475278437137604, 0.03537291660904884, 0.03933297470211983, 0.031372200697660446, 0.03700973838567734, 0.03562198951840401, 0.035398684442043304, 0.04088076949119568, 0.036206431686878204, 0.03560861945152283, 0.03400520980358124, 0.03371995687484741, 0.03401026874780655, 0.0295183677226305, 0.03585858643054962, 0.036097608506679535, 0.03460206463932991, 0.03324894607067108, 0.03803865611553192, 0.03773766756057739, 0.02545810304582119, 0.03562317416071892, 0.035056114196777344, 0.03863629698753357, 0.04339127615094185, 0.041452713310718536, 0.037705279886722565]]}
