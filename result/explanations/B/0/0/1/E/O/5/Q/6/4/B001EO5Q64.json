I've tried other brands but none of them were as good. I like this 15 ounce size better because you can use it up before it gets rancid. I had a much larger container before but it turned before I used it all up, we live in a hot climate so this is a great size to insure it stays fresh. I use one jar as a cosmetic on my skin and hair and we cook and bake with the other jar and use it in smoothies. It tastes great and is wonderful for baking when you want a little coconut flavor substitute it for the oil in the recipe. Great for curry and sambal recipes. Just know that it solidifies if it gets cold so as a salad oil it's not good because it gets hard when it hits cold food. It will do this when used as a marinade on cold seafood or meat but thats a good thing in that case because it stays hardened on the food till you get it on the grill and then it melts into it making it really tasty! There are too many uses to list and now that we know that coconut oil is a healthy oil there is no more guilt. I highly recommend this great oil.", "A year ago if you had told me about this, I would have said no way all the saturated fat. Since that time I have lost over 80 pounds, never felt better, and learned all we thought we knew about fat was pretty much a lie to sell more vegetable oils like corn, soy, canola.So in the 1920s there was virtually no heart disease. People ate butter and coconut oil. When we switched to margarine and the vegetable oils are health declined more and more and more. Please look up Mary Enig.But beyond that I love this oil. It tastes great in coffee. It really shines cooking with vegetables, but is also good for eggs, meats, just about anything. Very slight coconut taste when used in cooking. Highly recommended.", "Couldn't be happier with this coconut oil! I have a tub downstairs for the kitchen, and one upstairs for the baby's room. I use it as a cloth diaper barrier cream and for the baby's hair and skin. Worked wonders for cradle cap (though I am sure olive oil would have worked as well). I also use it for my skin and hubby for his hair so I am thinking we need to get our own tub as well :)It has a lovely scent, lightly nutty, not over powering at all.Highly recommend this product!", "If this is as healthy as it claims to be, I can't imagine any reason not to buy it.  The taste is very light coconut flavor.  It melts easily and doesn't burn.  I put this on corn and it seemed to make sweet corn sweeter.  I have cooked with it too with excellent results.  I just love the taste and it is much more healthy than butter.  And, it smells so good!  I see this as a staple in my kitchen from now on.  I am so glad that I tried it!", "\"Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil tastes so good in all the pan fried foods I've cooked so far.  I've fried up char-siu fried rice, shrimp fried rice, scrambled eggs, and even made grilled cheese sandwiches using this oil.  Everything comes out tasting great, with just a tiny hint of coconut aftertaste - not enough to overpower the dishes, but just enough for people to go \"\"what was that extra seasoning you used?  It's really good!\"\".The bottles pictured are not exactly the bottle you will receive - I got two smaller looking tubs of the coconut oil.  There were no problems with shipping, but I did notice that on a 70 degree day that my bottle of oil went liquid, so I can see problems arising when shipping during summer.  I haven't tried using this product on my skin or hair, but I can imagine it would smell nice - I love coconut!  Highly recommended.\"", "I've learned that coconut oil trumps olive oil when needed for saut&eacute;ing as this has a higher smoke point thus doesn't break down at fry temperatures. So I bought two jars and it looks as though that's none too much. Cuz right away I learned it has a lovely aroma and taste and gives that extra flavor boost. I had cooked a large acorn squash then mashed it right into the cooking water so it was semi-soupy and had enough that I needed to vary it for different meals. I flaked about a teaspoon of this (solid) coconut oil into about a cup of squash the first night, then spiced with cumin and heated in the microwave. The natural sweetness of the squash was complemented by the coconut flavor and of course the cumin jazzed it more. The next night I again added the coconut oil into the same amount of squash but this time stirred in about 3 tablespoons of sour cream and spiced the dish with Ras El Hanout and corrected the salt. Again yummy and was transported to someplace on another continent. The coconut flavor really makes a difference.I have a little project going making cosmetics, especially face and body creams. Can't wait to try its lovely *natural* fragrance and texture in those.", "The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil is one of the best, bar none! We use this product for our skin, hair, and separately in the kitchen.We highly recommend reading:The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)and other books by the author, whom has founded a Coconut Research Center.", "I'm a new convert to using coconut oil.  This oil is solid and white at room temperature, but melts very quickly into a nice clear oil.  It says it's best for medium heat cooking (i.e.baking) but I also fry with it (french toast) and it's great.I don't notice a strong coconut flavor (although the smell of coconut is very strong!) at all.It's also a good product for taming frizzy hair (just a touch in your hands.  Rub together to melt and then run through hair).", "I've gone through three little tubs of EVCO, now, and it's great.  I use it in place of vegetable oils and butter (or part of the butter) in baking, and the results have been very tasty.The coconut flavor is light but present, so that's something to keep in mind.  Some people swear you can't taste the coconut, others say it overwhelming the base recipe.  So far, in cakes, breads, and a few candies, the flavor has been complimentary.  I like it.As well, it is a tad sweet, so I adjust the sweetener in my recipes down a bit more than usual.I live in a climate that is warm for most of the year, so the EVCO stays liquid. Though it is shelf-stable, it may be worth considering how you would need to store it, based on your climate, before you buy.  This particular container size is very manageable to handle on the shelf, and it doesn't take up a lot of room in the fridge.I'm really happy with this product.  I plan to have it as a pantry staple for all of my baking.", "Possibly the best coconut oil I've tried.  It has a wonderful coconut-y flavor, melts beautifully, and is very light.
