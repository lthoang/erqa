"], "reviews": ["I can't believe this Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers actually tastes good!  And furthermore, the directions are simple, written well, complete with pictures if you can't read instructions well.  In other words, if all fails, look at the pictures!The packaging is compact, a bowl with the pasta, a lid that becomes the strainer, and another lid that contains the sauce.  It requires 3 and 1/2 minutes to cook the pasta.  And microwaving is safe; it doesn't make it coarse or soggy.  Let it set a minute and heat the sauce for 30 seconds.  Easy, a lunch/meal in less than 5 minutes.  This isn't meant to be enough for a dinner/meal, so you hearty eaters can open a can of vegetables and there you have a meal.One note on cooking the pasta.  Make sure the water covers every piece of pasta, otherwise you may get a hard end on the ziti.Take this for lunch on the go.  Eat it for a quick dinner and you have a tasty meal.  There are only 6 grams of fat, and 2g of saturated fat, and 230 calories.  Total carbs are 56g and 15g of protain.Nonrefrigerated!The special thing here is that the meat sauce with enough meat, does not have to be refrigerated.  So, my only guess is that is is hydrated or dehydrated, whatever they call it, so it doesn't need refrigeration.Quick and easy prep time, and tasty!.......Rizzo", "\"The HEALTHY CHOICE FRESH MIXERS: ZITI & MEAT SAUCE is delicious! It's easy to make and ready within 4-5 minutes. A slight issue is the water \"\"fill line\"\" on the container--for the noodles--it's a little hard to see.All you have to do is add water to the pasta, cook that first (3:30-minutes) and then drain with the included strainer as you warm up the sauce (:30-seconds). Add the sauce to the noodles and mix. That's it!The ziti & meat sauce has a very well seasoned flavor and small chunks of ground beef. There's no cheese added, which is good for those who are lactose intolerant, and the portion is just the right size. It filled me up, without making me feel too full, and it satisfied my hunger. Couple this with a side of salad or a vegetable and you've got a pretty good meal.There's 6g of fat (2g-sat fat) and 340 calories (50 calories from fat) making this a true \"\"healthy choice,\"\" since I've read that you shouldn't eat anything that gets more than half of its calories from fat. Compared toChef Boyardee Beef Ravioli, 7.5-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 12), the HEALTHY CHOICE ZITI is lower in fat by 2grams.It tastes good and you don't have to store it in the freezer or fridge, so it's good to take on the road as long as you have access to a microwave and some water when you plan on eating it. Yum!\"", "I usually do not buy off-the-shelf microwaveable foods, but I decided to try these Healthy Choice meals because they were offered to me as an Amazon Vine reviewer, and the experience turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The meals I received were Healthy Choice Ziti with Meat Sauce. The meals were very easy to prepare in my microwave. The packages serve as the preparation dishes, and come in multi-segment bowls that you heat one at a time. Overall preparation time, from figuring out how to prepare them to sitting down to eat, was five minutes. The Ziti with Meat Sauce tasted delicious, almost as good as home made. The sauce had both a delicate sweetness and a powerful tangy spiciness that excited my palate, and the ziti came out perfectly al dente. I felt satisfied tastewise and fullness-wise after I was finished. After this positive experience, I will be looking for other Healthy Choice meals to have in my cupboards for quick and healthy, delicious meals.  [...]", "The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce bowls are simple to use and pretty tasty.  The little bowls come with a strainer lid, a separate sauce container, and dry pasta.  You prepare the meal by first removing the strainer cover then taking out the sauce and setting it aside.  You then fill the bowl with water up to the fill line.  Place the strainer cover back on and microwave it on high for 3:30.  When the pasta is done you set it aside and cook the sauce for 30 seconds. Lastly, you drain the pasta and add the sauce.Overall the process works well, except the sauce required another 20 seconds to get the right temperature.  The strainer top is efficient and gets almost all of the water out.  The pasta is tender and the sauce tastes pretty good.  The meat sauce has a lot of meat, but not much in that way of onion or tomato chunks, which is fine by me.  Additionally, the sauce is mildly spicy, which I liked.  You get a pretty decent serving size as well, perfect for lunch.I like that the sauce is separate from the pasta, so you can add as little or as much as you want, and they give you plenty.  I also appreciate the fact that the bowls do not need to be refrigerated or frozen, so they are perfect to bring to the office.  The only thing missing is grated cheese, although that may have affected the calories too much, resulting in a not so Healthy Choice.All in all... A quick and tasty lunch that is not full of preservatives, and the packaging is well designed too.", "I am a fan of Healthy Choice products and this one is good too. I've generally used their frozen food options but liked the idea of a shelf storable healthy option for lunch.  This pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  The straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta.This mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta, drain it and add the sauce.  However, the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer.  A nice option for work or on the go!", "I am not a pre-packaged food kind of person but this product was very good.  The packaging was a little tricky using it for the first time, but the second time was a piece of cake.  I had some difficulty with the tamper proof wrap around the package as it is very tight and there isn't anywhere to grab it.  But using a fork solved that problem.  The directions were simple and straight forward, although I think something should have been said about removing the top covering material from the built in strainer before microwaving.  I will give credit that there is a pull tab that states this on the top of the container, however, since it's not in the directions, someone might not do this the first time.  The packaging is beautifully done with a convenient pull tab to take out the sauce bin and the built in strainer is nearly perfect (maybe add a couple of holes in the lip to aid draining, as water will collect there).Add water to the fill line, place into microwave, and out comes perfect pasta - not too soft and not too hard.  Then put the sauce into the microwave - this you need to be careful with.  The sauce will splatter a little in the microwave and the time (30 seconds) was not enough for me; I needed another 20 seconds.  Take it out and take off the plastic cover - a little tricky as you can splash yourself with the hot sauce in this step.The amount of sauce is perfect.  The taste is a little spicy (hot), and some might think it's too spicy, but I thought it was quite good.  There is enough meat in the sauce to let you know that it is a meat sauce.  I tasted it with and without added cheese and liked it both ways.  The volume of food is perfect for lunch.  There are 340 calories in the serving with only 6 grams of fat (2 saturated), and 8 grams of fiber.  The pasta was the perfect size and shape to eat.This was a very well thought out product and I am interested in the other meals within this product group.  I highly recommend this product.", "Healthy Choice used to be a byword for mediocre diet food. During the last few years, however, they've gotten better and better, producing tasty grub at reasonable prices and with some real health advantages over things like, say, Banquet TV dinners.This latest product, a tasty Ziti with meat sauce, is a little different from some of their others. First, it doesn't need freezing. Second, you cook the pasta by dumping in water, nuking it and then straining it through the nifty little strainer lid! This makes it ideal for a compact lunch you can take to work. All you need is some water and a microwave and happiness will ensue!As far as the taste goes? I was surprised! The pasta came out nice and tender and there was a good mix of flavors in the meat suace as well as some chunks of what I really hope were actually meat. Even better, someone who likes to eat large, I'll tell you this actually left me nice and full and not feeling like I needed to eat anything else right away.Very good product. Highly recommended!", "This small plastic bowl is a great slow acting purgative. Maybe it's the rubbery plastic tasting noodles that do the trick but there is plenty of  slightly spicy sauce to mask that flavor. While I can't guarantee the same results for you, after about an hour the Ziti and Meat Sauce came back up for me.", "\"Frankly, I was surprised at the size of this meal; I was expecting the typical tiny nuke bowl I've seen. I think I'm a bit bigger eater than many, and I found this quite satisfying. The bowl and strainer top were good quality plastic--not the stuff that goes mushy when you nuke it. I had one little problem with the system, and it was my own fault. I urge people to make sure to read the directions when nuking the sauce to avoid a very large and noisy mess. hehehe *blushing*Speaking of the sauce, it had a \"\"kick\"\" or \"\"bite\"\" I'd never tasted in a commercial sauce. Very unusual!!I missed one little thing in this fine meal system, and that was a dab of mozzerella cheese. It's an excellent choice, especially for those preferring a meal-for-one that's a little bit bigger.\"", "This has been my favorite Healthy Choice Fresh Mixer to date.  This meal does require draining. My office has a water cooler, microwave but no sink. There is NO WAY I'm going to take my food into the restroom to drain it. What I've done is kept a Fresh Mixer bowl from a previous lunch. I can then drain the water into it (with NO MESS) and then take it to a sink once I'm done eating.I was impressed with the taste of this meal. I'm a picky sauce person.  I also like thiner sauces on my pasta. This was not thin but seasoned perfectly.  No one ingredient overwhelmed the sauce. Usually they are too meaty or sweet. This was a perfect spicy Italian blend. I enjoyed it.The portion size is perfect. I'm a fan of high protein lunches because they keep me fuller longer. This one packs in 15g of protein. Love it.  This does have more sodium than I'm used to eating, however it's only 25% of the RDA so it's considerably lower than other quick lunches.The only con is the cost. Yes, it's cheaper than going out to eat at lunch and in an emergency, this is not a problem. This is a meal that I could eat more than once a week so the cost would holding me back from purchasing it as often as I'd like to.", "Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is very easy to use. To prepare it you remove the strainer lid and sauce tray, add water, and put the strainer lid back on. You then microwave the bowl on high for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, letting it stand for one minute after heating. Then you drain the pasta with the handy strainer lid and heat the sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds on high. When it is finished you mix and serve. The instructions are easy to understand and everything in the package is clearly labeled. You have a nice convenient meal in about five minutes.Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a good choice when you need a quick meal. It needs no refrigeration and has a long shelf life so it's a good item to stock up on. It is very tasty if a bit too spicy as the spices left a bit of an aftertaste. Because it is a single serving, it is not really for families at dinnertime - it is better suited as lunch, to eat after the gym, or for a single person. In fact, because it doesn't need refrigeration, it is a perfect lunch for people that work in an office, provided there is a sink nearby to drain the pasta. Because everything is contained in one package, cleaning is minimal - all you have to do is rinse out the containers to place in the recycling bin.While Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a healthy meal alternative there are a few things to be aware of. The meal has 340 calories - 50 calories are from fat. There is no Trans fat, but the saturated fat is 10% of the Daily Value and the cholesterol is 7% of the Daily Value. As with all prepared meals, the sodium content is high - 25% of the Daily Value.Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a convenient choice when you are pressed for time and not fussy about the type of sauce you use. However, it might be cheaper to buy your own pasta instead.", "\"The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce is a very respectable easy prep meal. Overall I liked it. It was tasty with a little bit of a kick in the seasoning. Not too kicked up though to dissuade or intimidate people from trying it. Personally I like adding a bit of parmesan cheese on top and a few shakes of crushed red pepper (pizza pepper).  The meat sauce was thick and chunky. The pasta held up well to the microwave and had a nice al dente feel. They use a whole grain pasta which is nice and healthier than white pasta. Lots of fiber here, to be sure.The preparation was easy enough. My only two thoughts were the \"\"fill line\"\" could be a little easier to see and I'd like the underside of the top pull away cover to have another copy of the instructions so I can read them as it cooks if I need a follow-up.  Over all an easy to make meal.The portion is a good size, it felt hearty. Accompanied by a nice salad this makes quite a pleasant meal.\"", "\"Since I am a hearty eater, I would consider this meal creation a snack or side dish to an already prepared dinner because the serving size is very small.  According to the label it has 340 calories (50 of which are fat calories) and the package advertises that you get 30% of your daily grains, 20% of your daily vegetables, and 15% of your daily meat in this one dish.The PROS:- Good as snack or side dish- Tastey with a little spiciness or \"\"kick\"\" to it- Easy to prepare (microwave 3-1/2 minutes for the pasta and 1/2 minute for the sauce)- Unit comes with built in strainer to drain pastaThe CONS:- Portion really too small for a meal.- The center tab on the sauce tray is only to be used for lifting the sauce tray out of the package.  It is not for also pulling back the plastic covering on the sauce tray. I would have preferred if it had this dual purpose as it is a little difficult to peel back the plastic on that tray.- There is entirely too much packaging and plastic.  The top acts as a strainer, the base acts as a pot and the sauce tray acts like a double boiler.  All these items are made of really nice hard plastic that stands up wonderfully in the microwave.  For such a small portion, you have to ask yourself is it worth it to clutter our environment with all this throw-away plastic.Because of the amount of pasta in comparison to all the plastic you need to package it in, I rate this item four stars.\"", "These are extremely easy to make and it takes so little time. In literally five minutes, you're done. Just add water to the ziti and microwave it for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Drain the water. (The lid is conveniently perforated with holes so that it can be used as a strainer.) Heat the sauce for 30 seconds (Or not at all. According to the instructions that is an option. I heated mine.). Done! Perhaps one of the easiest microwave meals I've ever had.Taste opinions on this will differ. I thought the sauce was decently meaty, but the first time I ate this, I thought it was a bit too hot and spicy for my taste. The second time, I loved it. Guess it depends on what type of food you're in the mood to have. Enjoy!", "This package of six lasted no time in my home!  So simple to fix and great tasting, my teen boys had them eaten within a day!These simple meals would be great for brown bagging lunchers.  After only 4 minutes, you have a complete meal at restaurant quality.", "Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce is a very convenient food to keep on hand. It would be great to keep in your desk at work, dorm room, or take on a trip. The packaging is well designed and even has a lift tab to make it easier to get the sauce package out. The plastic pieces are Number 5, which is recyclable in my town. The instructions are easy to follow and simple. Put water in to the line with the noodles and cook in the microwave for 3.5 mins and drain noodle. Next heat the sauce for 30 seconds and pour over the noodles. Mix and eat. The taste is very fresh and certainly better than leftovers. There are 340 calories per single serving package. The ingredient list is not too long and almost entirely recognizable. The sauce is pleasantly spicy. I would not make this at home, but it is a great convenience food for places that lack refrigeration or cooking facilities.", "We enjoyed Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Zita & Meat Sauce.  My friend and I are spicemouths, and we found the mixers decently flavored, perhaps better than some dishes we've tried in Italian restaurants that needed to fire their cooks.  We eat in many different restaurants throughout the United States to evaluate the food.  What we have discovered is that mediocre food can be made tasty if we apply our emergency taste-enhancer kit.  Actually this dish was better than mediocre; in fact it was tasty, especially after we added some items from the kit. (We keep an array of items in our glove compartments of our vehicles and on our breakfast bar.) Realizing that we did not want to alter the calorie-count too much, we added a tiny shake ofKraft Grated Parmesan Cheese - 4.5 lb. container, which was about 10 calories.  When we eat pasta, we like a little cheese. Then, being the way we are -- Louisiana and Texas people -- we needed a little kick.  We shook on a few flakes of crushed red.  (Tone's Spices Red Pepper Crushed (13.5 oz) - Large Restaurant / Food Service Size Shaker Container - Best Value per Ounce-- we really do buy the large restaurant shaker, but we carry a smaller version around with us in the car.)  That's all we added, although we do have other items in our emergency supplies.  With those two little items, the ziti and meat sauce tasted good.Preparing it was fun.  The cute little container with the strainer lid amused me.  I thought I would wash it and reuse it, but I was amazed to discover it was engineered for single use.This meal of 340 calories was satisfying and handled our hunger efficiently.  It contains 600 mg sodium, which is perhaps a little less than some prepared dishes.  I was surprised to see that it contains 990 mg potassium.  People with renal disease should probably avoid this product unless they have the approval of their physician or registered dietician. There are 6 grams of total fat and 56 carb grams. With 8 grams of dietary fiber, it should get an approving nod from Weight Watchers. It meets the criteria established by the American Heart Association.I would recommend this dish for anyone who needs to take lunch to work where there is no refrigerator but where there is a microwave oven.  I thought we would eat it again soon, but weeks have passed and we are still thinking about it.Mostly recommended.Mary Lou Cheatham, co-author of THE COLLARD PATCH/Author of FLAVORED WITH LOVE, SOLOMON'S PORCH,DO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LOVES YOU?", "This product is wonderfully convenient. You can keep it in your desk drawer at work (it doesn't have to be refrigerated) and have a handy, healthy lunch that can be microwaved in about four minutes. The taste is not bad -- not as good as homemade pasta and sauce, but I didn't expect it to be. For something you microwave at the office, it's excellent.", "\"My ziti and meat sauce arrived today and I opened the package to see just what this product is.  I received a box with 6 individually wrapped meals.  I took one out of the box and looked at the nutrition label.  This is always the first thing I do with any prepared food, especially ones claiming to be \"\"healthy\"\".  The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti and Meat Sauce's label wasn't half bad.  There are no trans fats and no MSG.  The oil content is low and the pasta is made with whole wheat flour.  Per the nutrition label:  Fat 6g: Sat Fat 2g: Carbs 56g: Fiber 8g (wow): Sugar 10g (a little high): Protein 15g.  The sodium was 600mg - a little high if you're watching your blood pressure.  Total Calories = 340.  All in all, not bad.I followed the instructions to prepare the ziti - add water to the line and cook 3 minutes 30 seconds then drain.  It comes with a convenient lid designed for draining the pasta. The pasta came out cooked but not over cooked.  Next you are instructed to heat the meat sauce for 30 seconds.  I removed the cover but no instructions said if I should or shouldn't remove the cover.  I ended up with meat sauce splattered on the inside of my microwave.  Finally, you pour the sauce over the drained pasta and eat.As I stated earlier, the pasta was al dente.  The meat sauce was sweeter than I like and had an interesting spiciness to it with a mild bite.  I prefer a meat sauce that is more salty and less sweet but I know a lot of people who like a sweet sauce so I still gave the product a good rating.  The sauce is meaty and the serving size is just right.  Served with fresh fruit or a leafy green salad and you have a complete meal.\"", "Honestly, I didn't have high expectations. However, this product seemed to me fun and easy to cook. I found it innovative and creative. All you do is add water and microwave it (and then strain the noodles with the built-in lid, followed by mixing the sauce with the noodles, of course). I found the meat sauce meaty and tasty (I'm not the pickiest eater). The extra convenient aspect of this product is that it requires no refrigeration, which means that you can store it with your cans of soup in the pantry until hunger emergency strikes!", "For the most part, I was impressed with the design elements that went into the steamer/strainer/etc. components and the meal was much tastier than my standard microwave speed lunch choices.I only had a few minor issues with the product over all... the directions are spread out in several different locations on the package, so there remains a chance that you might miss one and prepare the meal (most importantly to remove the plastic film on the strainer lid before cooking).Also, the water fill line is not all that easy to make out. Most products have a more obvious version and I found myself having to take extra care in adding water.The meat sauce took a bit longer than suggested to cook. I had to up the cook time to a full minute to get a satisfactory temperature.My final criticism concerns the heat of the container after cooking. Granted, you get a little rest for that to cool down while you cook the sauce, but it was still uncomfortably warm when I ported the two (with the sauce atop the strainer lid and lower/main dish in my hand).All in all, I enjoyed the product, despite my small nitpicks and, barring a prohibative price point, would definitely purchase mixers for my on the go working lunches (of which, I seem to have plenty).", "\"I don't want to be over-negative here -- this product will definitely meet the specific needs of some folks such as those who have little time or, college students who live by microwave cooking. But for the average consumer, this product has some clear drawbacks. There are five facets to my evaluation: ease of preparation, flavor, health aspects/portion size, environmental concerns, and storage, (I'm not including price, which people can weigh for themselves) so I'll enumerate my observations here:1. Preparing the dish is a bit of a pain, compared to the Healthy Choice frozen dinners. It's essentially a five-step process, although I did find it necessary to additionally microwave the \"\"finished\"\" dish for an extra 30 seconds. I found it difficult to read the instructions on the side and on the top due to the tiny font size, but young people will probably not experience this problem. Microwaving the sauce can generate a tiny mess because you pull back a corner of the packet to allow steam to escape and mine bubbled out slightly. So, I did have to go back and wipe out the microwave with a damp rag. The water fill line is lightly stamped into the clear plastic and is near impossible to see initially -- you really have to look for it (on each end). The manufacturer would have benefited the consumer by putting larger font instructions on a removable card on the top so that one could just stick it under a refrigerator magnet to see what to do at each step; however, once you've prepared this dish the first time, it would be easy to do a second time without instructions.2. My wife and I both tried the product and we came to essentially the same conclusion... it's not nearly as tasty as the Healthy Choice frozen dinners, which we like very much. The pasta comes out remarkably well, au dente, very tasty. Of course, \"\"taste\"\" is very subjective and we are pretty discriminating so I'll just say this: if you think that McDonald's hamburgers taste pretty good, you'll probably be okay with the taste of this dish. With the sauce, the dish has a fennel-Italian sausage ambiance and it's not at all bland. I'm not a vegetarian but, honestly, I think they'd have been better off to go with a meatless marinara sauce for broader appeal and better flavor.3. The product (entire dish) has 340 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2 grams of saturated fat. The dry weight is 6.95 ounces. In terms of portion size, I weigh 280 pounds and I'm a big eater -- the portion size was plenty large enough for me and the meal was hearty to the degree that I was not hungry again an hour later.4. Environmentally, this baby is a bit of a nightmare. While the plastics are mostly of the recyclable type, most people who typically recycle plastic beverage bottles are probably not going to recycle this -- I didn't bother (even though I recycle a LOT of plastics, glass, and paper) because it takes more hot water to wash/rinse out the two plastic bowls and the lid than the plastic is worth -- in other words, in terms of energy use, this packaging is a loser. Unfortunately, I can see no other way to set it up -- the manufacturer has already reduced the necessary components to the least number possible.5. The best aspect of this product is that it's very convenient to store, no refrigeration required, and the bowls stack nicely. The manufacturer's \"\"use by\"\" date extends for about a year, although I suspect that it would keep even longer than that under ideal dry storage conditions.To summarize, you could slightly improve the flavor of this dish (which would also boost the calories and the fat content) by sprinkling some freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the top of it. But the bottom line is this... even though it would take longer, I would much prefer boiling a little of my own pasta and using some canned spaghetti sauce, warmed in the microwave, OR, I would recommend buying the Healthy Choice frozen dinners which are much more convenient to prepare and tastes remarkably superior to this product.\"", "There are several brands of microwavable meals on the market - Dinty Moore, Campbell's, etc - which do not need to be refrigerated, and require you to do no more than unseal the container and microwave it, usually for about 90 seconds.  These Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a little more involved, requiring you to add water (which hardly seems an onerous task, but these days, who knows what's considered onerous?) and they take about 5 minutes to prepare.  For the slight extra inconvenience, you get fresher pasta, tasting more like 'proper' cooking.The water level line is not as clearly marked, and the sauce cover not as easily removable, as they could be.This particular variety is very tasty.  Packaged pasta sauces often have a harsh, chemical taste, but this one was nice enough.  It's hardly a hearty meal, but it's a good light snack.  If you take microwavable meals to work (or college, or wherever) every day, then you'll want some variety, so you should give this one a try.", "Healthy Choice has a winner in this new idea of a fast food meal. I tried the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers in the Ziti and meat sauce flavor. This is really a neat product. It can be stored in the pantry, no refrigeration needed. When ready to eat at home or office, you just open the package, which contains the ziti in a microwavable bowl with strainer,  sauce in separate package. Could not be easier to prepare. Just add water to fill line over Ziti, cook 3 and 1/2 minutes in mcrowave, strain and add meat sauce. The directions say to heat 30 seconds after adding sauce but I did not need to do this because the room temperature sauce on hot ziti made it just the temperature I like for eating.The sauce is meaty and flavorful and the ziti just the texture I like.I think this product will be a winner in the Healthy Choice food line.I use a lot of Healthy Choice products but this is my favorite so far.", "This is a meal solution for busy working folks who would like a hot and fresh meal with minimal prep time. You could use this either for lunch or dinner. One distinct feature of this product is that it comes with individual units containing the fresh mixers that can be mixed prior to heating. Storage is easy since this does not need refrigeration. Just add water to the pasta, snap on the lid, cook (microwave) for a three minutes, drain the water, add the sauce (from sauce pack) and cook for one minute and enjoy a hot meal. I did not like the Ziti and meat sauce, but if you like meat sauce, this is for you. Other sauces available are; Sesame Teriyaki Chicken, Southwestern Style Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken (see Healthy Choice website). If you have precooked vegetables sitting in the fridge this is the time to use. I would use; cheese (personal favorites are Parmesan or cheddar), broccoli, Bell peppers, garlic, Zucchini squash, or mushrooms, I would recommend combining these with your sauce while heating the mixture. Use your imagination to add or substitute any of the veggies recommended. I liked the ease of the preparation and the separate units containing the sauce for ready mixing with cooked pasta.
