I downloaded the manual.  I made a list of everything I needed, and what I would NOT want as well.  This receiver is the best match I was able to find for what I wanted.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews, from multiple sources, put me over the edge.To anyone who thinks that this is \"\"too complicated\"\" or that the manual is \"\"unclear,\"\" I'm sorry...  reading is fundamental, learn it.  I knew everything I needed to know about using this device before I even bought it.  And when I got it, I was able to make everything work... perfectly... and painlessly.The sound quality, with my 7.1 system (a pair of original Bose 301 speakers for my fronts, a set of Klipsch Quintet III speakers for my front-center and my four surround speakers, and a Polk PSW505 12\"\" subwoofer) is phenomenally nice.  I've got three auto-generated sound/equalization calibration schemes set up... these were done \"\"automagically\"\" with the provided microphone...  so I get perfect sound imaging from my recliner, from my couch, or near-perfect centered on the entire seating area (for shared viewing).  I've got a blu-ray drive, a 5-disk DVD changer, an LP player (through an external phono preamp), a tape deck, a VCR, a cable DVR, and an Archos portable \"\"Internet Media Tablet\"\" all hooked in, and still have room for two more inputs if I need them... plus the built-in AM/FM tuner and the interface to an external Sirius device, of course, and the iPod/USB-drive interface.Control is really pretty simple... IF YOU READ THE MANUAL.  It's not intuitive if you're the type who would rather muddle through it all, though.  Remember... \"\"measure twice, cut once\"\"... in other words, think it though before you start trying to do it.I was prepared to pay a LOT for the \"\"ideal device\"\" for my purposes.  Instead, I was able to find a terrific device for a reasonable price that does everything I could ask for.  So far, after several months of continuous usage, I'm happier than ever with this device.The only drawback I've found is that, like any \"\"high-power\"\" device, this device generates quite a bit of heat.  If you're putting this into an enclosed space, expect it to get warm.  (In my case, I do have it in an enclosed space, along with all the other devices listed above... but I have a large, slow-turning ventilating fan in the back of the cabinet to pull air through.. it's silent and removes all the heat.  If you're in an \"\"open\"\" installation, this isn't an issue...  but if you want to mount into a cabinet, either implement forced-air-flow, or accept that things will get fairly warm.)\"", "Pioneer VSX-1019AHDuring 2 yrs 2 months use, the unit would loose video, wouldn't shut down via power off/on button or remote, would come up in zone 2 and couldn't be changed to zone 1, couldn't push open front panel after about a yr. The setup for speakers with mic was annoying since volume of speakers was rather loud. Component video stopped working after 2 yrs 5 months.The input for Satellite didn't support component video had to use 3 wire which is not as good video performance. There just aren't enough component video inputs. Difficult to bind speaker wires because of tight space between posts.Needless to say not very reliable - expected 5 yrs of use, expensive unit which doesn't last long. ~ $250/yr for use isn't worthwhile. Save your money and look elsewhere.", "\"I bought this back in December of 2009, but didn't get a chance to set it up for several weeks.  I have a brand new 55\"\" Samsung LED so it should be up to date.  Well, I could not get the on screen menu to work.  So, I put it away for a few weeks and tried it again today.  Today I tried again to get it to work, but no deal. I even tried composite video input and the on screen menu would not come up.  That alone would have been enough to make me chuck it out, but then I also learned that if you want to use HDMI output to a TV, that the sound has to be sent using another method.  I was very dissapointed with this  product and the manual which was no help.  I've been using audio and video stuff for 30 years, so it isn't me.  Unfortunately I through out the box that it came in and I can't send it back.If I do decide to get another, I'll go to best buy and have them prove to me that it works by having them set it up.I searched on line for assistance with the menu problems but could not find much.Maybe I got a bad one or maybe my TV is too new.\"", "\"I have the typical Time Warner 8300 Scientific Atlanta cable box and I wanted to run everything via HDMI to have only one HDMI out to the TV with this receiver. All was going great after all connections were made. Wii looked stunning, Bluray looked better than ever, and cable was good too until I switched to channels streaming anything but digital audio.Apparently HDMI out of the cable box does not support anything but digital sound. The receiver would cycle thru all known audio streams on the display non-stop...looking for something...anything to play. No one can confirm this is an HDMI issue, or a cable box issue. I got no response from [...] (cable box parent company), and the Time Warner people were useless and claimed HDMI was not supported!  Well, maybe they were not useless, I just don't want to believe them!!!Running a single cable to the TV  (and getting Wii upconverted...nice FYI...but about the same as running the componant cables to the TV directly) was a big reason why I bought this unit. But for the cable box, I had to go back to running a separate audio cable and use component cables for video so the cable box would not override the digital out for sound thru the HDMI. (HDMI gets priority)Automatic set up was just ok. I still had to do a lot of manual adjustment to alter the set levels, none of which is very easy to do and not everything is built into the GUI. Some settings are still on the receiver display only (like loudness). I could it not get it to sound as good as my older Pioneer 711 either, and I could not figure out why after days of playing with it.Finally, none of our iPods were recognized by the receiver via the supplied cable. The GUI would only say \"\"loading\"\" for hours and hours. Did I get a bum unit? Probably...but this was strike 3 now. It's gone.Take my review for the receiver with a grain of salt...I think it's a great unit for this price especially based on the video quality of the upconversion and analog to HDMI out. However, I would advise taking the HDMI audio out from the cable box seriously.\"", "I had an HD projector, PS3, ipod, cable box and a couple of Polk Audio Monitor 60 speakers connected to this receiver and all work splendidly.  No frustration in the setup and has met all expectations.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.", "\"This receiver sounds amazing for the price. It is also very easy to set up and configure if you are semi-technical. My only complaint is that it doesn't \"\"play nice\"\" with the DirecTV HD receiver. Not a super big deal, but when you first turn the unit on, the sound and video for the DirecTV receiver appear, but then the Pioneer immediately switches to a different input. Sometimes it takes 2-3 times of setting it back on HDMI 1 for it to \"\"stick\"\".\"", "My wife and I are not audiophiles per se, but have been seeking that unicorn of sound systems: something cheap that sounds great. Not Kef, not Bose, not even Polk - just something that recreates the movie theater experience in our not overly large living-room. The Pioneer VSX-1019AH-K (or whichever marketing iteration it is now in) is that mythical beast come to life: an incredibly powerful, feature-rich receiver to which you can connect any audio and video source under the sun, from optical to HDMI via composite. It was relatively easy to set up, although as others reviewers have remarked the instructions feel at times like one of those riddles Bilbo had to solve to get the ring. Of course, with plentiful features comes the headache of figuring them out, and we're still dealing with that - but of the the tremulous bass! The crisp dialogue which no longer requires us to frantically press the volume controls like mad texters! The beautifully balanced surround sound! Pioneer has put a lot of engineering and marketing effort into this system. Now it just needs to hire an Apple person to develop its manuals.", "I'll start by saying we're on our second unit.The system has a fan to keep it cool and the first unit we got had a faulty fan or thermostat and the fan didn't run. This caused it to run hot and then the power LED started flashing.We returned this and got a unit the next day shipping from Amazon. Was very impressed with that. Good customer care. Applause to Amazon.Now I have a fully functional unit, it's sonically very good.I have it partnered with Yamaha in Ceiling speakers for movies and a pair of B&W; 685 speakers for music on the front 2 channels. It's probably the best receiver sound at this price I've heard.The self setup (with a microphone you plug in) is very helpful. Takes the hassle out of setting volumes and delays.Its USB media support is limited. It only supports FAT (no linux file systems). It also doesn't support lossless audio format FLAC. But the ipod support is useful.Picture quality off the HDMI looks pretty good too.", "\"I've had this receiver for about two weeks. It's not exactly \"\"plug & play\"\", but it's worth the effort. The sound is a great improvement over my 10 year old Sony (which had lost it's surround functionality). It even sounds better through headphones. I have a pair of Shure in-ear phones I use most of the time, but even the wee Apple earbuds sound decent with this receiver. I've heard little bits of dialog I'd never noticed before in some favorite films. Many have mentioned the cryptic nature of the manual that comes with this receiver, but it's no more so than many of my other components. There's a bit of esoteric stuff for those who want to get into the ultra fine tuning of the speakers, but I found the automatic microphone set up to work quite well. The only tweaking I did was to raise the high end in the EQ for a slightly brighter sound and to nudge the surrounds up a notch. My only \"\"complaint\"\" would be the cluttered remote. I use maybe a third of the buttons on this thing, probably less. But this is true for most components. The iPod function also works well; I love running Pandora through this thing. As far as the \"\"video up-conversion\"\", I don't really see the point. I tried running the standard (SD) digital Comcast signal through it but you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The PS3 and the plasma handle conversion just fine. It's also slightly insane that they tout this ability while removing any S-video connection. I had to go out and buy component video cables to try this feature (I have three or four extra S-video cables languishing!). On another point, I haven't had any excessive heat issues. I've got the unit on a shelf with about a foot of space above and six inches on either side. Others have insinuated that you could almost fry eggs on the top; not true (at least in my case). All in all, a very nice piece of equipment.\""], "Gamma": [0.00019764610624406487, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497352063655853, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497542053461075, 0.12497637420892715], "Beta": [[0.026428790763020515, 0.005865833256393671, 0.02488451823592186, 0.6613941788673401, 0.11923295259475708, 0.0741686224937439, 0.05828012898564339, 0.02375982142984867, 0.005985052790492773], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973704427480698, 0.010149121284484863, 0.02221769466996193, 0.5956937670707703, 0.1815638393163681, 0.055512867867946625, 0.05966665595769882, 0.05139025300741196, 0.004832095466554165], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966665968298912, 0.05139050632715225, 0.004832086618989706], [0.018973661586642265, 0.010149155743420124, 0.022217674180865288, 0.5956932306289673, 0.1815643012523651, 0.05551275610923767, 0.05966664478182793, 0.051390498876571655, 0.004832086618989706]]}
