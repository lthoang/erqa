This unit is below the Garmin standards but significantly better then anything TomTom produces. The onboard memory is just barely sufficient to hold the NA maps. In fact, you have to remove languages in order to be able to load anything extra. While there is a slot for a micro sd card, it has very limited use. You can load an additional map OK. However if you load personal POI's onto it, every power on it pesters you to load them into the main memory - which, as mentioned, is very limited. Unlike my other 275T, there is no way to tell it to stop asking that question. Aside from the small memory problem and lack of reasonable support for the SD card, the unit works reasonably well. The enhanced lane guide is an interesting feature but I have found very few interchanges that are actually available for this capability. The standard lane guidance (just the arrows) work well enough. This has the typical Garmin problem that modifying the route is not possible, aside from telling it to avoid specific things (like highways, toll ways, u-turns, etc). I haven't used it a great deal yet but on the one major trip I took it did lose its end point once and decided to select some different destination. When I noticed that it kept trying to take me off the portion of the route I knew I should take, I selected the destination again and had it recalculate - then it was OK. So, as with all these units, it is a good idea to have a general idea of the route and not trust the unit completely. The Bluetooth feature seems to work OK but it is useless for me since I use a bluetooth earpiece instead.", "I've had many GPS units over the years starting back in 1999 with my very first Garmin Color Pilot.About every 2 years I've sold off or passed down my old units and upgraded so I know a few things aboutthe evolution of portable GPS devices and the Garmin product line.The 1390T is excellent, Amazon had it at a fantastic price nearly $60 less expensive than I could find anywhere else the day I purchased it.The 1390T has everything I was looking for:* WideScreen* Lane Assist - Notifys you which lane to be in for an upcoming turn on/off the highway* Traffic - Advises you of upcoming lane closures, traffic jams, accidents and can route you around it1390 comes with a life time subscription to traffic updates, so you don't even have to pay for the updates.* BlueTooth/Speaker phone - Very handy, you can sync up your cell phone, and the 1390T will display all incomingcalls on the screen using caller ID, and even allows you to answer the phone directly on the unit via the builtin speaker phone. Very cool, and I've found a must have feature. The speaker phone works fairly well, but I willadvise since the microphone is very sensitive use with your windows closed to eliminate background/road noise.* Fast maps - This unit aquires satellite signals, draws the maps, and calculates the route the fastest I've seen.Compared to a friends Magellen and anothers TomTom? Both have some neat graphics, and a couple of little featuresbut the features don't really help the GPS function. In reality I've found, for the money the 1390T just hands down beats the competition. In fact Garmin units in general are just superior as they use the NAVTEQ maps, which are themost current maps I've found for North America.So how does the 1390T rate compared to my previous Nuvi 660, Streepilot 330, I3, or Color Pilot? A++", "\"I have 4 different Garmin products--2 for backpacking, and 2 for use in the car. Look for my rave review of the Garmin 255W here on Amazon from several years ago. I called it \"\"best in class\"\" but those days are over.Unfortunately my 1390t has been a headache from Day One. There have been 3 big problems: It reboots and locks up frequently, the traffic feature has never worked right, and it often does a much worse job of routing than my old 255.The traffic feature has *never* worked right in several cities that supposedly offer the traffic updates. Sometimes I get the obnoxious ads (it's an ad supported service), but never any live traffic information or routing. The one exception was 200 miles from my destination in the middle of nowhere in the Utah desert, the GPS suddenly announced \"\"severe traffic ahead in 190 miles, recalculating\"\"?!?!I'm sorry, but 190 miles ahead on my route was a tiny little town with a population of about 1000 that probably has never had 'severe traffic'. And given that it was hours away, what good is such information anyway even if it were true? So, for me at least, the traffic feature has been 100% useless and actually a negative as the ads and the above incident have been annoying.Also annoying is you're driving along and \"\"poof\"\" the screen randomly goes black, and if you're lucky, the garmin logo appears, and the GPS reboots itself. And, if you're really lucky, you haven't missed any turns and can press MAP and it still knows your destination. Sometimes, however, it starts over and you have to start over. And sometimes it locks up completely and you have to hold the power switch to reset it. This has happened DOZENS of times. It's not safe to try and reset it while driving so you have to pull over to power cycle it. Is firmware this buggy really acceptable Garmin?And yes, I've run the Garmin Updater several times. But what a confusing piece of software! It runs and then presents you with a longer list (as in dozens) of check boxes than Windows Update. How am I supposed to know which ones to update? Some are abbreviated and cryptic. Do you just check them all and hope for the best?And the routing is horribly off sometimes. I fly to the Bay Area often and the 1390t takes me on a very slow route with dozens of traffic lights from the airport to my hotel compared to the much quicker freeway route the 255W uses. There are many other examples of the routing being off.There was a day when Garmin made the best GPS units out there. But it seems those days are behind them. They're apparently either cutting staff, rushing half baked products out the door, and/or otherwise sacrificing quality--likely in a misguided attempt at making greater profits.The bottom line is my 1390t is so annoying I rarely use it anymore. Instead I shuffle the much older 255W between cars. Even with its out of date maps, lesser feature set, and older design, it works vastly better than the 1390t does. So much for progress! Garmin should be ashamed.\"", "I read many bad reviews of the product but I though it was because many reviewers are not smart enough to use it. However, after using it for a month, i have to say the product is not good enough.I used it in Manhattan, Queens, Flushing, NJ area. It does show traffic information and calculates route based on traffic delay. However, i believe their algorithm has strong flaws! It seems when comparing speed, the GPS takes local (in Manhan) route as 30 or 40 mph without traffic light and jams. It is rediculous! THerefore, when there is a five minute delay in highway (e.g. I9A), it will consider local to be faster. In the end, I have to turn off the avoid traffic option.In order prove this, one day my friend and i drove back together, i followed gps and he drove on highway. Although I9A has strong traffic, he is still 20-30 minutes faster than I do when taking locals. So when Garmin put this function into the market, they should seriously reconsider if such a big company should waste other people's life by a stupid unmature technology. And the problem is without several experiments, people might not figure out whether the GPS wastes our time or not. Garmin is not responsible about his customers at all. It just want to post ads which looks fancy.Note: software updated to the latest. All functions discovered.Pros1) lane assistance is accurate 80% of the times. It is quite helpful.2) very responsive.Cons0) the traffic calculation just doesn't work as promised!!!1) freese or map layout error several times. black screen one time. Turn off and on again would solve.2) It automatically switched on or off when car starts or off. no options to leave it off all the time.3) it doesn't show the current road! Have to go to the next map and magnify to see it.4) Junction view is a crap. My previous Navigon reality view is much better and it was the technology three years ago!5) there is no way to manually avoid a street.6) there is no night view mode. for example, turn white background to black background. too bright at night7) i haven't found voice alert for over speeding.8) it is quite stupid to tell you keep left all the time on high way. Instead it should say keep on high way XXX for XXX miles.Overall, it is a modern GPS works well. But i don't know why it is the no.1 brand GPS but still with so many missing functions. I would recommend this GPS to other people anyway because others might be even worse. Maybe the good programmers do not want to go to the GPS company. After so many years development, Garmin brings such a product... hard to say... feel sorry for Garmin. My standard might be high anyway.Update: After using for two months, the GPS happens to mute itself automatically once in a while. I need to restart it to bring the audio back. Very frustrating! I have to move it down to 3 stars.I wonder if it happens to anybody else. Or any workaround?", "I had this GPS for 2 weeks so far:This GPS is designed to be simple to use. It's fast to acquire its location and use is obvious enough to be very easy.Pros:- Voice is loud and clear. You can make your own voice set by downloading an application from Garmin. The application makes you say each voice component and creates a voice that you can upload to the 1390T.- Better (than other GPSs I've seen) job at showing what's relevant on the map. On other units, it annoys to see half of a name of a street or not to see the names of the streets you are about to cross.- Lane assist is great! It tells you on which lane you should be.- Traffic info. This is free-ish. You may not pay for the feature with money but you will get adds that appear when the car is stopped. This adds are not very annoying, but I would prefer not to have them, yet somehow that service has to be paid for.Cons or things I would change:- When selecting a place to go, it should not be necessary to hit a GO button again. If the user already selected the place to go, why the need to confirm?- The Favorite places should also be accessible in the menu without going through Categories. It would be simpler.UPDATE:After using this GPS unit on foot, I saw that the battery is not big enough. It may work if you turn it on to know where you are, but not for keeping it on by it's own battery for ore than an hour. This limits the use for tourism.  This unit works very well in a car connected to the lighter outlet.", "\"I owned a Magellan 1440 and liked its interface, intuitiveness and extreme ease of use. Unfortunately it didn't have a Mac updater and had to be used with Windows. After listening to lots of sales people and reading tons of reviews I decided to get a Garmin 1390T, which was supposed to be the \"\"Mac of GPS's\"\". I've used the thing now for a whole day and I'm very sadly dissapointed in Garmin's much-touted interface, which is clunky next to the Magellan. The spoken voice is nice on the Garmin, and the default can be changed to several different voices, even with British or Australian accents, male or female. The Magellan has a single female voice that sounds a bit like a drill sergeant, but ultimately I preferred her warnings and the tones that sound just prior to turns.The Garmin took over 5 minutes to locate GPS satellites the first time. It wouldn't work inside the house, which was easy for the Magellan. The biggest drawback is the way Garmin has nested its Points of Interest. I was looking for an Indian restaurant my wife likes, as a test of the POI's. I spent 10 minutes and couldn't find a listing for Indian food at all. Very unintuitive and frustrating. There seems to be no logical order to the listings, and it's definitely not in alphabetical order. The Magellan 1440 took me all of 30 seconds the first time to find the exact restaurant I wanted.The touch screen frequently didn't sense my touches, and I had to press some keys on the keyboard several times, even though the keys lit up, the letters or numbers didn't register. I often had to press a lot harder than I expected to make the keys work. Magellan's screen was much more responsive.The screen was nearly impossible to see outside, even on an overcast day without direct sun with the screen brightness turned up to 100%. Unless it was angled just right I could barely read what was on the screen, limiting its usability for pedestrian use in finding your way around a strange town on foot or bicycle. The Magellan's screen was bright and easy to see regardless of lighting conditions. I didn't know what a good unit I had until I got rid of it.The updater download was confusing and it didn't work with Safari for some reason. I tried several times to download the updater and kept getting a blank download assistant window. I then tried using Firefox and after 3 tries, I was able to download the software (the first time the software crashed Firefox). The updating process took about 40 minutes, plus about 20 to download the software to the Mac--and felt Windows-like (inelegant and not quite sure the right thing was happening). Even though the Magellan is Windows-only, it was far easier, more intuitive and faster to update!I was prepared to love this unit. Instead I'm not impressed at all. I find it more difficult to use than the much cheaper Magellan, less responsive to touch, harder to locate POI's with far too many button pushes, and generally much more aggravating. It's going back to Amazon and exchanged for another Magellan, possibly the Maestro 4700 or another Roadmate 1440 or 1470. I hate returning stuff, but it's just not any fun to operate. My advice to Garmin: Look at the ease of use of Magellan's units and get your designers to think of the user experience.\"", "The good:Works very well with the Ecoroute HD accessory.Looks very nice.Works great, most of the time.The bad:Ads. What the heck? To disable them, you must go into the settings and turn off the traffic feature.The device has rebooted on me a couple of times before, and has lots the route it was on before as well. Pretty unacceptable.Overall it is a decent unit, but not the best out there.", "Does it work? Generally.Do I like it? Generally not.Pros:- good mounting clip- sturdy build quality- relatively easy to use interfaceCons:- takes forever to get GPS reception (it's not an issue with where I am, because my phone picks it up instantly)- routes in strange routes frequently- no way to avoid a specific road (detour frequently routes you back to the road you want to avoid)- no way to choose a specific route- map zooming is too slow- junction view is annoying- ads are annoying (but not too bad, since they only popup when stopped)- traffic receiver sucks and rarely works- map updates are too expensive...could just buy a new GPSHonestly, it seems like the only times I really ever need to use GPS the thing doesn't work properly...just want to throw it out the window.I really hope that Garmin goes out of business (which I see happening, as more and more people are getting smart phones)", "My son always borrows my garmin gps. So for his 23rd birthday I bought him his own>Great piece. big screen.", "I decided to get this one with traffic to help me in Virginia and Washington DC to find out it is just crap.1- traffic is not working properly at all, it takes me to green roads running away from the red roads with at least 10 min delay to find out that I should stick with the red one since I spent an hour in the green one. i think it is just a joke.2- maps not updated at all since I found many roads not showing in the maps.3- faster time is not working properly since it takes me to roads with two hours while i can reach in one hour only if i take the road I know.4- some times getting stuck and not working.5- three times got crazy in Washington DC and let me turn around for almost 3 hours to reach my distention in each trip.6- hardly the callers can hear me when i use the Bluetooth so I have to use the cell phone again.7- many shops, banks,.....

I went many times to places to find they moved already long time ago.I don't recommend it at all", "We've used several GPS units and this is by far our favorite.Hilights:The interface is simple, intuitive and easy to use.The guidance is clear and very well illustratedThe route calculations are MUCH better than others we've tried (like the one built into our new Acura)The map view also displays your current speed and the speed limit... NICE!The map view also shows which lanes you should be in for the next exit, freeway merge, etc... very helpful and surprisingly accurate.Bluetooth integration means you can use it with your phone as a speakerphone/hands free device.I really don't have anything negative to say about this... it's a fantastic GPS, and the price on Amazon beat out BestBuy on sale..."], "Gamma": [0.11719927936792374, 0.11719927936792374, 0.11719927936792374, 0.11719303578138351, 0.11719927936792374, 0.13382841646671295, 0.11719927936792374, 0.16298221051692963], "Beta": [[0.00011655052367132157, 0.02674214169383049, 0.00013819349987898022, 0.00012768784654326737, 0.3847114145755768, 0.004190556239336729, 0.11135069280862808, 0.004907711409032345, 0.02040107548236847, 0.1551024168729782, 0.29221153259277344], [0.00011655053094727919, 0.02674213796854019, 0.00013819345622323453, 0.0001276878610951826, 0.38471147418022156, 0.004190556704998016, 0.11135071516036987, 0.004907711874693632, 0.020401082932949066, 0.15510238707065582, 0.29221153259277344], [0.00011655052367132157, 0.02674214169383049, 0.00013819349987898022, 0.00012768784654326737, 0.3847114145755768, 0.004190556239336729, 0.11135069280862808, 0.004907711409032345, 0.02040107548236847, 0.1551024168729782, 0.29221153259277344], [0.00011655483831418678, 0.026742389425635338, 0.000138197690830566, 0.00012769219756592065, 0.3847106099128723, 0.004190597217530012, 0.11135197430849075, 0.004907787311822176, 0.020401569083333015, 0.15510186553001404, 0.29221075773239136], [0.00011655052367132157, 0.026742136105895042, 0.0001381934416713193, 0.00012768784654326737, 0.3847114145755768, 0.004190556239336729, 0.11135071516036987, 0.004907711409032345, 0.020401081070303917, 0.1551024168729782, 0.29221153259277344], [0.0001275159593205899, 0.025725169107317924, 0.00012016852997476235, 0.00012841253192164004, 0.38725364208221436, 0.004551602061837912, 0.11506479978561401, 0.00488388491794467, 0.021860187873244286, 0.14787821471691132, 0.2924064099788666], [0.00011655052367132157, 0.02674214169383049, 0.00013819349987898022, 0.00012768784654326737, 0.3847114145755768, 0.004190556239336729, 0.11135069280862808, 0.004907711409032345, 0.02040107548236847, 0.1551024168729782, 0.29221153259277344], [0.00017620209837332368, 0.022194400429725647, 7.159692904679105e-05, 0.00013032548304181546, 0.39452123641967773, 0.006124252453446388, 0.12904144823551178, 0.0047701094299554825, 0.027994906529784203, 0.12347862869501114, 0.2914969027042389]]}
