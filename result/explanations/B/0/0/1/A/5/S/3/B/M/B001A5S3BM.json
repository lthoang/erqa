"], "reviews": ["Who knew that the gift of the gods -- the fig, can also bring alot of sweetness and goodness to the hands of those who use this hand cream!!!Thick and fragrant, great for hands and feet (but IMHO, not for faces because it is so thick), this Sweet Vanilla Fig hand cream containing many natural ingredients, absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a fragrant and protective feel to the skin.I tried Sweet Vanilla Fig on my feet too and enjoyed the same results.When I tried it on my face I was not too crazy about the feel of it-- it IS thick and suited more towards protecting and moisturizing the hands and feet.Knees and elbows would benefit by the applicatin of Sweet Vanilla Fig too.I can hardly wait for our usual moisture-robbing winter air to set in -- applying Sweet Vanilla Fig hand cream to my hands will help keep the skin on my fingertips from cracking as painfully as it usually does every winter. I plan to liberally slather Sweet Vanilla Fig on my hands at work, and put (unpowdered latex (or non latex) gloves on, to keep my hands protected and to enhance the protective and remoisturizing properties of this hand cream.A winner for sure!!!My OHLY gripe is with the packaging/ergonomics -- and perhaps this is TEMPORARY packaging until the product gets more commercial recognition?I had to trim (I trimmed it into a curve) the edges of the heat sealed top of the tube because the edges were very sharp. I also had to trim (file down the sharp edges) the cap/lid area, where I would normally press on it with my finger, to open it -- the edges on both counts were SHARP; why should I have to cut my fingers or hands while in the process of opening this tube of hand cream??My 82 year old aunt liked Sweet Vanilla Fig hand cream so much she asked me to order her two tubes. Coming up, Auntie!! (But I WILL trim the heat sealed (edges) top of the tube, and lid edges before she gets them)", "\"This rich and highly aromatic cream is great to slather on your hands...arms...legs...feet! Anywhere that feels really dry and in need of some massive pampering. With a mixture of fig and vanilla extracts, soy oil and shea butter, as well as aloe, your skin will soak it all up and the \"\"lizard look\"\" will be history.The aroma is strong and unique, and providing you're not planning on wearing perfume to fight it, very pleasant. The stumpy dark bronze container makes easy to squeeze out a nice easy stream of the luscious cream too, even when you get down to the end of it. I love this Upper Canada Whipped Hand Repair Balm! And for a lot more than my hands.\"", "The hand cream not only makes your hands incredibly soft, but it smells great too. Just a light scent of vanilla, not too overpowering. It's a nice thick lotion, but doesn't leave hands all greasy; can't wait to try it on my feet!! I would definitely order again.", "This is a pleasant smelling (hint of coconut, although it's vanilla/fig?) heavy hand repair cream best suited to nightime application, and probably even better when used with cotton gloves. This allows the emolient to fully penetrate through the night, while sleeping. The main reason I say this is that the whipped cream is so rich it takes a long time to absorb. For me during the day that's actually inconvenient, much wringing and rubbing still left me feeling like I had a barrier cream on. A quickly absorbed shea butter, or general hand cream is good to supplement this, but to get the best results, you have to be disciplined enough to apply it every night. It may seem a little pricey for a 4 ounce tube, but the mixture as already said is very thick and thus not as much is needed compared to similar, cheaper products I have tried. Living in Minnesota through the winter means that hand or dry skin lotions are constantly used. Early signs on this product are promising, time will tell on long term benefits.", "Winter is coming again, and while I dislike that, I do like my drying out skin re-moisturized by this creamy lotion. Who better to know about hydrating winter skin than the Canadians, ay? A little dab goes a long way in smoothing yours hands without feeling greasy at all. It absorbs without leaving a residue and I like to use it on my dried out feet as well.The scent is light and fresh without being repulsively heavy. You won't smell like either an old lady or a perfume factory. Several of my male friends thought it smelled nicely coconuttie, I guess that's the fig. All around it was a real winner.", "This is a wonderful hand balm.  I love the fact that is contains all natural ingredients, and will purchase it again. It is thick and rich.  There is no greasy feel like some hand creams have that make it necessary to wait several minutes before it is safe to touch anything.  This hand balm is very quickly absorbed into your skin.The light fragrance is pleasing and not overpowering.  I'm sure this will be my hand balm of choice for the coming winter.  Try it you won't be disappointed!", "I'm thoroughly impressed by this hand balm/lotion!  Here's why...I learned to lay floor tile this summer, and I finished my first tiling job a couple of weeks ago.  Those of you who have laid tile know that it can be a dirty job that involves some substances that are definitely NOT skin-friendly!  While scooping my trowel into a 5 gal bucket time and again to get thinset mortar, small bits of mortar got onto my forearm and hands.  It partially dried there and I had to work hard to get it off whenever I had breaks in the job.During the three days I was laying tile I got mortar on my skin again and again.  By the end of the job the skin on my forearm looked not only rough, but extremely damaged and scaly!  My hands were also chapped and their skin was likewise damaged.  My knees weren't looking that great either (even though I'd used knee pads...).About a week later the condition of my skin had not improved, and I was able to pick up a tube of this hand balm.  I started applying it 3-4 times a day to my hands, forearm, and knees, and within only a couple of days the condition of the skin on my forearm, hands, and knees had improved noticeably. After four days my skin was back to normal, or even a little better than normal!I'm not a hand cream connoisseur, but I know what works when I try it, and this product works!I found the vanilla-fig scent to be pleasant without being overpowering. In addition, I like that fact that this whipped balm is not oily, and that it works into my skin relatively quickly.I am totally satisfied with this product and highly recommend it to anyone who is dealing with damaged skin.*Important note*: There is a foil cover over the the opening of the tube.  Be sure to remove the cap, take off the foil cover, and replace the cap before you try to squeeze out any balm.  If you don't remove the foil cover there's a small chance that the back of the tube could blow-out!I give this product 5 stars all the way!  I also believe that the $7.00 or so price tag is well worth it!", "I love vanilla skin products and especially like this product because it is paraben-free (parabens have a connection to cancer). The US still allows these preservatives to be added to cosmetics. I am glad to see manufactures are removing these awful ingredients hidden in the products we put IN and ON our bodies. Now if the US would only ban these products as they do in the UK!!!This has a light fragrance and feels lovely on my skin. I tend to have dry skin and it makes me feel moisturized without a heavy feeling. It's a hand cream, but I like it all over and especially good on my feet before bedtime. Although the fragrance is light, it is a perfume scent and not the real scent of vanilla.They list their product as NATURAL which is a bit misleading because most products/lotions are natural. I'd like to see ORGANIC instead since natural can contain pesticides.", "\"I like the texture of this hand cream - it's much thicker than a typical lotion like Vaseline Intensive Care or Lubriderm lotion, but not as thick as something like Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream (my previous favorite), Eucerin Cream, or Bag Balm.  It moisturizes and protects my hands every bit as well as the Neutrogena or Eucerin products, but is absorbed more quickly and feels less greasy.The tube has that \"\"luxurious\"\" look, so this product would make a nice stocking stuffer or basket-filler.  The tube is a nice mid-size, perfect for stashing in a desk drawer or glove compartment.  It's a little too large for my purse.Though the scent is not terribly strong, it is probably too feminine for the guys to feel comfortable with it.\"", "\"This is a rich lotion and you only need to use a small amount of it on your hands. If you use too much, it won't absorb well and your hands will feel greasy. The right amount (for me) was about half the size of a dime. So if the lotion seems too oily, try just using less.The lotion worked well as a repair cream (as advertised); it made my hands feel soft when they were dry. Repeated use, however, does not seem to improve the condition of my skin overall. The lotion seems most effective for immediate relief of dry skin.When first applied, the lotion smells very sweet, almost cloying, but after the lotion is absorbed, the smell is mild and pleasant. The scent does seem more natural than other scented creams. It's called \"\"Sweet Vanilla Fig\"\" but to me it just smelled like vanilla.This hand cream has a very luxurious appearance and initial feel. Again, it seems best at immediate relief for hands. I think it would make a good gift, or a nice addition to the guest bathroom.\"", "The Upper Canada Soap and Candle Naturally Whipped Hand Repair lotion is a joy to use and is non-greasy, being absorbed into the skin very quickly. After just two days of use, my hands feel noticeably softer.  In addition, this lotion has a very nice real vanilla scent that is not overpowering (a concern because we have asthmatics in the house) and lingers pleasantly for a while after using.I also like that it is made of natural products and is free of parabens, mineral oils, and synthetic dyes.Treat yourself! Recommended!", "I'm glad I was able to try this hand cream.  It's richer and thicker than lotion so I'm calling it cream.  They call it balm.I love the fact that is mineral oil free and contains all natural ingredients, but the feel and smell are why I'll purchase this in the future.It goes on feeling substantial, but not oily.  Your skin feels sealed by it.  Best of all is the lingering scent.It's like a sweet vanilla with the extra note of fig.Not overpowering or sickly sweet and strong.Both the cream/balm and the scent are very soothing.Great to keep on the desk or near the sink.", "A little goes a long way.  A pea size drop is all it takes.  Leaves hands feeling smooth and not greasy.My daughter has sensitive skin and this did not burn her hands like most.  She adores it, so will be getting her some for her Birthday and possibly Christmas. She says smell remind her of the fig scented lotion at bath and body .Safe natural ingredients making cream free of parabens, mineral oils and synthetic dyes. Makes excellent gift.", "\"Unlike creams and lotions from big names like Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret, the Upper Canada \"\"hand repair balm\"\" has a very light fragrance that will not overpower everyone in the room with you.  It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed without leaving too much of an oily or greasy feeling.  This is one of the few creams out there where you can actually touch paper or other items without transferring any oily residue!*** Positve Points Include: ****- Quick absorption into the skin- Low fragrance (if that is what you like)- Very little oily/greasy residue- Made from all natural ingredients*** Negative Points Include: ***- Fragrance fades from a light \"\"sweet vanilla fig\"\" to more of a shea butter smell in a matter of minutes. Nonetheless the fragrance is light enough to not be distracting.Overall this is a very good hand cream for those who prefer a light fragrance and something that is made from all natural ingredients.\"", "Naturally Upper Canada - Whipped Hand Repair Balm, Sweet Vanilla Fig (Formulation 404) 4 fl oz.The whipped hand repair cream has a very rich vanilla and Shea butter scent and dispensed through an easy to use squeeze tube. According to the ingredients label, it contains fig extract, vanilla extract, Shea butter, Soy Oil, and Aloe. It is advertised as being paraben free, mineral oil free, synthetic dye free, and SLS free. The cream leaves a light greasy feeling, most likely from the soy oil.I usually have dry and sensitive hands, but I found this cream worked well to moisturize my skin. After using it for a few days, I have not experienced any allergic reactions so the ingredients agree with my skin.Pros: Attractive scent, easy to use and apply, leaves no residue.Cons: Slightly greasy feeling.Overall: I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it works on my dry skin, but I would prefer a less greasy feel.", "It works well and lasts for a while.  It doesn't really have much of a sent, but I liked it.", "Upper Canada Soap And Candle Naturally Whipped Hand Repair is one of the best hand cream products I've ever used. My hands are constantly in water and they tend to get very dry -- so dry that the tight, uncomfortable feeling is very annoying. I have tubes and pump bottles of hand lotion all over my house and in all my bags. I experiment a lot, and they range from good to useless. After all, it's hand cream, and I'm constantly washing it off and applying it again.What's different about this product is that the effects seem to be more long-lasting. My experience is that this product seemed to really sink into my skin, soften it (great on the cuticles!) and my hands felt a little less dry even after I washed them.This is a product that I will most definitely purchase again and again!", "My wife wouldn't touch the stuff--she has her favorite, FANCL from Japan.So I tried it instead, being a regular user of creams and lotions particularly for sports--but also for just plain healthy skin (my favorite being Aveno).  I tried this particular product on both my hands and feet.Very good stuff for those of us who use our hands a lot--immediate gratification--but the scent is horrendously strong.I thought the strength of the scent would subside after five minutes, then a half hour, then an hour, and then finally it bothered me so much that I had to wash it off--never to be tried again.It's not a bad or pungent scent, but at this level of strength it seems rank.BOTTOM LINE: This is an excellent lotion for repair of the skin on even the most tortured hands and feet, especially if you really punish them with use or weather.  Better than Bag Balm for sure.And if you want to simultaneously repel humans and attract bears, it's great for that too.  It smells like one of the better quality brothels one might visit or the Abercrombie and Fitch on Water Street in Downtown Manhattan--which reeks of perfume.This would be a great product in an unscented variety.  Heck, remove the scent, and I'll buy it.", "I am very picky about hand creams; they have to be luxurious, soothing, rich and emollient, deeply hydrating and never sticky. This cream comes very close to being perfect and I really enjoy using it. I wash my hands a lot since drinking tons of water makes me run to bathroom a few times a day and this keeps them soft and supple no matter how generic and stripping the soap is at work. The tube is large but can also fit perfectly in my bag and the scent is warm and soothing, nothing strong and scary. The fig is a hint of amber and vanilla just a tad sweet, overall a very cozy fragrance. With creams that aren't rich enough I find myself applying them all day long, which drives me crazy but with this cream one application is all I need for relief unless I wash my hands again, which requires a new dose.I also love the lack of paraben's and dyes and all that yucky stuff. I know I will be back for more; the avocado scent looks comforting as well. I find that shea butter always feels very soft and silky yet it hydrates well without leaving my skin sticky, so this is a winner in my eyes.", "First off I really like the fact that it's paraban and mineral oil free. Quality bath products shouldn't contain mineral oil. This one also contains glycerin and shea butter both of which are wonderful for your skin. It goes on nice and smooth with a light vanilla scent and quickly dries leaving your skin feeling soft and supple but not greasy.", "So why did I mention Sarah Palin in my tagline?  Well, you see, I live in Anchorage, Alaska, right down the road from the Vice Presidential hopeful.  We both have to endure miserably cold, dry weather for several months out of the year.(It's the first week in October, already we have several inches of snow on the ground and my hands are as cracked and dry as an elephant's knees)I found this hand lotion to be smooth, light, and silky.  The lotion went on easily, with no sticky or greasy residue.The scent was a bit cloying at first - an overpowring sweetness - but soon dissapated, leaving just a hint of vanilla.I would recommend this lotion over Burt's Bees, which can be too greasy and heavy, or The Body Shop's Almond Lotion, which can be too light.I also highly recommend L'Occitane's Shea Butter Hand Cream for a light, delicious-smelling, and thoroughly  effective treatment for elephant skin like hands!", "I have a love for NATURAL products and fig scented items are one of my favorites. This Upper Canada version has a very similar smell to Bath & Body Works fig products, but a more natural ingredient list (though NOT organic).This SWEET VANILLA FIG did not disappoint. It has a wonderful WARM almost coconutty scent that lingers for a long time, but more importantly it made my hands soft and SUPPLE but NOT at all greasy. It absorbed THOROUGHLY and I was able to type on my keyboard minutes later, ENJOYING soft hands and a nice, sweet smell as promised.The ALL natural ingredient list also makes me feel GOOD about using it as OFTEN as I would like, and letting my KIDS use it, too....though I will share it reluctantly!", "I am always looking for a good hand cream that is effective in the very dry air of Oklahoma yet not greasy.  This Upper Canada hand repair cream fits the bill remarkably well.  It absorbed quickly -- a big plus -- and left no greasy feeling, unlike many other hand repair products.The lotion is not animal tested, according to the web site, and free of many of the chemicals that so many of us are sensitive to.  I do not usually care for vanilla scented products, but this scent is light, lingers nicely, and does not cloy.The container is the right size to carry in a handbag or stick in a desk drawer and the lotion comes out easily in the right amount.  Nothing so annoying as getting a huge squirt of a lotion when all you wanted was a small amount!In sum, I like this product and would recommend it highly -- especially to those of us in very dry air climates.  I'll purchase this when it does come available in retail stores -- for now, it's an online purchase only.", "Note: I wrote this review of the other Upper Canada Hand Repair, in Avocado.As you would expect, the Fig and Vanilla scent works equally well and smells fantastic too.I work around a lot of things that dry my hands out and make them rough. I am not the hand creme type, but my hands are rough and dry often. I occasionally would use run of the mill lotions at the gym or the like, but they didn't do much at all. The last hand treatment that worked this well was about $17 for a very small tube, but it worked well.  To me Upper Canada has a good product with an even better value.I have used the Upper Canada Hand Repair for about 6 days and it works quite well. It absorbs well, smells nice and lasts long. It doesn't feel greasy and makes my hands feel hydrated. I can apply it and it absorbs fast enough (&lt; 1 minute) so I can get on with what I am doing. Since it doesn't take long to absorb, I don't hesitate to use it.What more can you ask for?", "\"My wife and I both used this hand cream and had mostly similar feelings towards it. We both felt the \"\"hand repair balm\"\" was easy to apply to our hands and absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. Shea Butter is one of the ingredients and we always seem to prefer hand creams that incorporate Shea Butter... they seem to be more effective for us. After a few days our hands were noticeably smoother and softer feeling.My wife did not care for the \"\"Sweet Vanilla Fig\"\" fragrance as much as I did. She did acknowledge that it wasn't an over-strong scent but she didn't care for it. I felt the fragrance was pleasant and not objectionable at all.We like the fact that the hand balm is made with all-natural ingredients and has a variety of fragrances available.I'm rating this 5 stars as the cream worked well and is priced attractively. We look forward to trying the other fragrances.\"", "Ever since I turned 50, I find that my skin is unevenly dry and this particularly impacts the skin on my hands. I found Naturally Whipped Hand Repair is great for helping smooth my skin, without feeling greasy (which is something I found in using other lotions and creams). I apply it several times a day, but especially before bedtime and after washing my hands. Since using it, I find my hands look younger, the skin is softer and the aroma is wonderful. I highly recommend this cream to anyone who experiences dry skin. Especially with the winter months quickly approaching, this cream is great to keep to use in your home and in your office. I love all the Upper Canada products but this hand repair is definitely a must have!", "In the winter my hands often become so dry the skin cracks and becomes painful.  I've used high end body butters but they leave my hands oily.  I like using cocoa butter with shea butter but I smell like chocolate all day.Today I tried the Naturally Whipped Hand Repair (Sweet Vanilla Fig).  First I read the ingredients.  It contains fig extract, vanilla extract, shea butter, soy oil and aloe.  Nice - there are other ingredients but nothing too scary.  The product is parabin free, mineral oil free and contains no synthetic dyes.  Next, I sniffed.  The cream has a pleasant vanilla scent and is a little spicy.  After an hour, the scent was a little stronger than I like but not overwhelming.  Finally, I smoothed the hand cream onto my hands.  The skin on my hands currently is only a little dry, not the scaly cracked skin it becomes in the winter.  Still, the hand cream was absorbed by my skin and didn't leave an oily residue.  It's been several hours since that application and my hands are still smooth and soft.  I can't wait to use this product when my skin is really dry.", "This skin cream is awesome. It smells so good as well as refreshing. The best part is that all you need is a little bit, because it will go along way. I like the natural products and its great to fit in your purse", "\"If you like heavily scented body products, then you might like this item more than I did.  I tend to purchase body and hair care products with mild or no scents added, so this product was not to my liking with its very sweet vanilla aroma.  I also found the product to be heavy/thick, but I suppose it's meant to be that way in order to help \"\"repair\"\" hands.  I cannot really comment on whether this product is effective in that regard since I cannot imagine using it enough to test it out, even though I do have some callouses on my hands from weightlifting and also suffer from dry skin during the winter months.\"", "I prefer natural or organic products and normally shop at The Body Shop for my make-up and lotion needs.  Both Upper Canada and The Body Shop are against animal testing.  After testing their Whipped Hand Repair Balm I would say both companies are also comparable in their appeal.I should mention that I have sensitive skin and have to be careful about which lotions I use.  This hand lotion contains shea butter, which is what I usually switch to in the wintertime when the heater steals the moisture in the air and my skin suffers for it.  The great thing is that unlike most products with shea butter this hand lotion goes on smoother and doesn't leave a greasy feel behind; there's nothing like putting on hand lotion, picking up something to eat, and tasting lotion - yuck!  This lotion has a light smell, which is supposed to be Vanilla but honestly I think it smells more like coconut, which I like.Definitely recommend.  I absolutely LOVE it.", "When I was young, I loved building model cars and planes.  My hands would get covered with cement and paint and I'd clean them off with paint thinner.  As a result, I've suffered from old lady hands since I was about 12 years old.  I've tried other hand creams and thought maybe I'd give this one a try only because it was free.My frist impression out of the tube was that it was heavily scented.  When they said vanilla, they meant it.  My hands looked great right away, but they always do just after putting on lotions or creams.  The test comes with time.  Sometimes, the effects of those things fade within the hour.I have to say, my hands have never looked better.  They actually look supple again and I don't remember when they ever looked supple.  And the scent, though strong coming from the tube, is ever so subtle with time (or does my nose just get desensitized?).  I don't know.  I like how my hands look.  They're not greasy, either.  I've had some hand creams be so greasy, I didn't want to touch anything.  No, it just melts right on.When this runs out, I'll have to buy some more.  Great product.", "This is our first time using any of this company's products. My wife and I both tried it, and we came to pretty much the same conclusions. It's soothing but leaves a greasy feeling after each use, which is a big turn off. The smell is decent if you like vanilla, and it's not overpowering by any means. We do like the fact that it's free of mineral oils and synthetic dyes, but overall we do not believe this is a product we could see ourselves using on a regular basis."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.029039209708571434, 0.028774892911314964, 0.03118683211505413, 0.030748166143894196, 0.028572117909789085, 0.03324754908680916, 0.031140966340899467, 0.031280700117349625, 0.03109685145318508, 0.03071470372378826, 0.030740508809685707, 0.03401092439889908, 0.03087061643600464, 0.03085683099925518, 0.02699452079832554, 0.03316367045044899, 0.030789250507950783, 0.03286493197083473, 0.03072337619960308, 0.032832201570272446, 0.032419923692941666, 0.028819531202316284, 0.03531063720583916, 0.03031107969582081, 0.031476110219955444, 0.03288128972053528, 0.03049805387854576, 0.032981641590595245, 0.03169387951493263, 0.03144832327961922, 0.030842682346701622, 0.0316680371761322]]}
