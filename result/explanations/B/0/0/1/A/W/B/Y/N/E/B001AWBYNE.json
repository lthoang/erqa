Is it multiplayer "], "reviews": ["\"This game is another good installment of COD. Everything about it is about the same as COD4, except a WWII version. The controls are exactly the same. This time, you play as against Japan. Then, you play as Russian forces against the Germans. The Japan stages are really intense. The Japanese fighters are very aggressive. They will charge at you bayonets. Now, you have a chance to defend the attacks. When they come up, you can press the R3 button and counterattack by stabbing them in the throat. It will remind players of the counterattacks of the dogs in COD4. Some stages will remind a player of COD4. For example, there is another sniper stage called \"\"Vendetta. In this stage, the player is a Russia soldier in the middle of Germany. The stage is very similar to COD4's \"\"All Ghillied Up.\"\" Of course, the stage is a lot more intense and a heck of a lot more things are going on. I don't want to spoil it for new gamers, though. The cutscenes are very intense. The only thing is that I'm a little tired of WWII games. That is the only reason why I gave the game 4 stars. Still, if you are a COD fan, this game is for you.\"", "I expected a lot coming in to World at War because I had been reading about WWII quite a bit lately and thought a quality PS3 game on it would be fun.  Although there were some areas of the game that worked, they were far over shadowed by the more annoying aspects of the game that ruined it for me.The pros: beautifully rendered world, tight storyline, cool weapons and vehicles.  The world itself is beautifully rendered.  The landscapes look so real when fighting Japan and Germany that it helps bring you into the WWII world.  The destruction of cities and the destruction of human life is, seemingly, accurate.  At times you will see a wounded soldier rolling around on the floor, or a Japanese soldier running around caught on fire with his arms flailing everywhere.  You couldn't help but be fascinated by the world you were experiencing.  The storyline is very accurate to the actual WWII history, not too mention the tactics of the four nations during the war is well rendered. Finally, I couldn't help but have fun with the flamethrower and the tank, two aspects that I had a surprising amount of fun with.The cons: Facial features and annoyingly constant death.  The facial features are no where near up to the level of the rest of the game.  All too often they just looked like some zombies or corpses walking, which was a striking contrast to the beautiful landscape and world.  Finally, the absolute killer for the game was the absolutely numerous number of times that you die.  You are always seeing a grenade indicator and usually would always die if you are anywhere in the vicinity.  You would die so often and repeat the checkpoint so often that you are constantly getting so annoyed that you want to stop playing right there and exchange the game for something else.  The game certainly could have done away with half the grenades and made it so that you didn't die so often and still had a very real feeling game.  This, of course, was their objective.  And though death is real feeling in World at War it doesn't need to be so much since all that does is take the enjoyability out of playing.I still can't get over how fun an experience it was to storm Shuri Castle in Okinawa and the Reichstag building in Germany, giving you such a well rounded experience in just seeing the beautiful architecture, only to have them blown to bits by war.  Some of the more redeeming values of the game.  Unfortunately the annoying aspect, which no game should ever become annoying, completely overcomes everything else and left me with a game that I probably never play again.  A recommendation with the caveat of being prepared to be annoyed.2.5 stars.", "Off the cusp of possibly the most successful FPS to date, Call of Duty 4, there was no doubting the high expectations people would hold for the next installment. Treyarch have done something very clever as they have taken everything from the old series and enhanced on it, apart from the campaign mode that is, but I'll go into that in a minute. The graphics and basic intense working engine are increased to an epic scale which I honestly can't describe, you get close to 50 AI soldiers on the screen in the more intense battles. This year the Call of Duty series goes back to its roots with the world war 2 depictions. Some said it was a bad idea given the success of the last installment, but this was quashed when we were introduced to possibly the coolest weapon of the game, The Flamethrower. This presents a more graphical and realistic quality to it as the behaviour of the flames and the interraction with the environment only add to the experience.I mentioned about the campaign mode and feel I need to clear something up. Don't get me wrong, the campaign mode is awesome and is something quite enjoyable, but like the last installment it was way too short. I would say it could easily be completed in about 5 hours, if that. The missions are excellent and quite impactful and entertaining, but unless you're playing it on veteran difficulty, you're going to end the game feeling a little robbed. Like the last game you play through two seperate campaigns. On one side you're an American soldier entering into numerous battles with the Japanese, on the other side you're a soviet soldier retaliating against Nazi forces and eventually take Berlin.The Multiplayer features much like the old COD4 multiplayer system with its perks for excellent gameplay. Much like COD4, when you're in a multiplayer game, you're rewarded for kill streaks.3 Kills gives you Recon5 Kills gives you an artillery strike7 Kills gives you dogsDogs are particularly awesome as you can set them free to attack and kill your fellow online player.The graphics are really pushed more in this game as well, I mentioned the flamethrower but also the general gore of the game is something to smile about. Say for example you torch someone with the flamethrower, you will witness their charred remains as they lay dead on the ground. Also the use of quite powerful shotguns or even rocket launchers on your enemies blows them into tiny and satisfyingly gory pieces.Overall I would still highly recommend this game as it's certainly a franchise that will get better and better over time, especially as they push the PS3 processing power further than ever before.", "\"So I finally got to play the three modes this game has to offer, and since it had been a hot issue, whether this game was just CoD 4 on WWII wheels, I think some things needed to be cleared up.- Graphics- this game doesn't look much better or detailed than CoD4. The difference? Much fancier settings lead to seemingly \"\"better\"\" graphics. CoD 4 took place in very droll settings (modern- day terrorists should get interior decorators, for reals) but the fact of the matter is, they look practically the same. That's a no no for W@W, 'cos they could have at least ....improved a bit. The water, in case you were wondering, looks good enough to drink, get some type of poisoning for drinking water where rats pee, and then die drowning in your own pool of vomit and bile right by the good looking water. (since water and face movements are two watermarks for how good graphics are)-Sound- the guns sound amazing...in the sense that most WWII weapons sounded like pop guns in comparison to modern guns. The voice acting is really really good. Like, really. The music in the Pacific Theater levels SUCKS. It actually sucks so much, it's overshadowing a very nice game. It's a faux pas comparable to using Godsmack for PoP Warrior Within. I dunno who Sean Murray is, but dude, you is the suckzors. On the other hand, Mr. Lost Boys himelf as Cpl-then-Sgt- Roebuck is EXCELLENT. And, not to be left behind by Gary Oldman as Reznov (who, for any of you who saw Enemy at the Gates, should have been called Koulikov, but I guess they would have sued)-Gameplay- Oooh ok, the nitty gritty. This game has way more...um...quirks than CoD4. Collectibles, and um, modes and stuff. So, if that's your tea in a cup, goodly.  But this game does not feel as tight as CoD4. The \"\"sloppiness\"\" isn't so bad that it detracts from gameplay, but it is noticeable. Right from the start. It doesn't help either that more often than not, there's a variety of paths to take... not that the game is not linear... it is, just, it's up to you whether or not you want to take it up through the trench, or whether you want to slap the bullseye on your helmet and go over the top. But, for the most part, ahem... yes, this is CoD 4 on WWII wheels. To me though, that's not bad. Is it worth shelling over $60? At first I thought no, but there's the issue of different game modes...Single campaign solo- This game suffers greatly from uneven level design. Let me specify...the game, unlike CoD4, doesn't follow a cohesive storyline...the problem lies in the fact that you're not pursuing two terrorists who have one common endgame...no, you're fighting the whole axis...so, when you take that from macro to micro, it suffers and the levels seem tacked on. Truth be told, every level feels separate from the next. Which, in retrospective, makes CoD4s SP truly shine, because it now seems like a great movie. W@W just seems like random WWII encounters put together. I LOVE WII so that's not a problem for me, but it might be for you. Now, the meat and potatoes,-Competitive MP- well. I am WOWED. It is very much so like CoD 4, but before you start complaining.... think about it: what's bad about that!? And what I've been hearing is true: Power Housing in this game is way more difficult, as is camping....because, it's easy to catch a camper sitting on his arse from behind. The level designs were thought in a more organic way... I think. War ravaged buildings= outlandish situations. Another, very interesting byproduct of this being a WWII is the weapons.  You might say \"\"huh??\"\" Well, WWII shooters have... WWII guns. What does that mean?? Well, by modern-day guns standards... a lot of the weapons used in WWII are underpowered. A few exceptions aside,  the weaknesses of WWII guns have been implemented in a way that it hinders you like it would in real life, something that wasn't really present in CoD4, because modern day guns are a progression of improvement in weaponry. The MP5 for example, is a powerhouse, because heck, it's a frickin' state of the art gun! But, for example... take the beloved M1 Garand. It's powerful, and it is precise. And you have to have a happy trigger finger to have a good repeat on it. And you have to take a frickin' clip out, and it goes \"\"ping!' when you're out, and that's gonna be every 8 shots. Shoot! Another example?  The BAR. Ooooh, chills. Well, it's slow going, and the clip is a measly 20 bullets. Shall we talk about bolt action rifles? Shoot, bolt, shoot, bolt... five bullets and megalong reload??? Oh noes! Also, the grenades weren't as powerful as they are now, and Tater Mashers are sort of a joke, unless you have the aim of William Tell.  So I think, for now, since I'm still starting, the gameplay has been kept level with the guns as well. Now, the pleasant surprise,-Coop MP- Well, I played with a friend, and WOW, we kept dying and coming back laughing. Talk about team work being important. It's similar to R2s co-op, but there are no classes, so every character is on the level, and every player can take care of their buddies with careful planning. But I gotta say, and hey, we only played about two levels, my friend and I , but this mode made me say \"\"well, I'm glad I didn't wait until it got down to $40\"\" Really. I mean, this mode of play overshadows the SP greatly, for the single fact that it's the same thing, just multiplayer.So, these issues taken into account, I still don't know if we could cut Treyarch some slack or not...they say plagiarism is the best form of compliment. These guys might not be the best developers around... and they are not far from being the worst, from what I hear ( I never played CoD3), but they sure know how to identify the features that make a good game and putting them together.As a sidenote, the first level you play as a Soviet is a dead ringer for the initial scenes from Enemy at the Gates, which had been somewhat depicted in CoD, but it didn't matter much to me, it was incredibly fun. Old timey sniping was good timey sniping.Btw- the flamethrower? Let's just say, I've rekindled my pyromania, at least in a safe way. Pun totally intended.\"", "\"COD-WAW - the latest installment of the Call Of Duty series is set in the closing stages of WWII. As with most COD games, you alternate between two characters. In this case a Russian advancing on Berlin, and an American GI clearing out the Japanese islands.ControlsAs you'd expect, COD-WAW is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and the controls are identical to the hugely playable COD4.GraphicsThe graphics in COD5 are excellent. The environments are detailed and the map size is up on COD4 with some truly sprawling levels this time around. The Berlin levels leading to the Reichstag are simply incredible with brilliant artwork and modelling that truly represents the bombed-out city at the end of the War. The amount of popup (where items suddenly pop in to view) is lessened compared to COD4 but it's still very noticable, especially when approaching the windows of a building to look out. As with COD4, to start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. The smoke and particle effects have been heavily modified this time around and are much improved. The smoke grenades in particular do not stress the PS3 anywhere near as much as they did in the previous game. There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.New in COD5 is \"\"graphic\"\" content, by which I mean mutilated bodies. With the advent of the flamethrower - a truly terrible weapon - you will be presented with burned, mutilated bodies as a result. In multiplayer mode, your character takes damage now too - step on a landmine and in the instant replay you'll see your leg blown off with nothing but a bloody stump remaining. For the parents or squeamish, these effects can all be turned off though.SoundThe audio on COD-WAW is also improved somewhat on the previous game. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. Again there's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without suppressors, but I suppose only a classic gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right.Single playerSingle player mode is a good intro to World At War. The maps are varied and as I said in the intro, the missions are split between US and Russian troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works. The game is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes. As with all COD games, one level stands out head and shoulders above the rest, and this time around, for me it was the fleet defence mission. You find yourself as a gunner in a US flying boat trying to defend part of the US fleet against Japanese attack. The aircraft in question has 4 guns - left and right waist, nose and tail. The brilliant thing is that you can swap to the different guns, and when you do, rather than simply cut to the new position, you run through the aircraft, past other crew members to the new gunnery station. The first time I played this level it was an unexpected gem in the otherwise ground-based game. Having said that, the three maps leading to the toppling of the Reichstag in Berlin are also worthy of note because of the sheer scale and detail.One fun addition is the Nazi Zombies level. Once you finish the single player game once, there is a one-off level that you can play where you are locked in an abandoned house. Nazi zombies swarm the house and your job is to kill as many as you can before being overwhelmed. You can rebuild window barricades as they are pulled down by the attacking horde but it takes time - time you don't often have. There are extra sections of the house that can be unlocked once you have enough points. The advantage is that more powerful weapons exist elsewhere in the house, but then so do more doors and windows for the zombies to get in. There are a couple of awards - instant kill, nuke, and 2x points. Ultimately you'll be mauled to death by a hideous Michael-Jackson-Thriller-like zombie with glowing eyes, but how many can you take down before it happens. This is actually a surprisingly fun level to play and re-play although it's not obvious why it was included in World At War.OnlineOnline gameplay is where COD-WAW really shines in terms of fun factor. As with COD4, there's a load-balancing system so newbies don't drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who can snipe them through glitches in the map. The experience points (XP) system is present and correct as are the commensurate unlocks and and challenges. The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock the challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one.There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. A new addition to World At War is the \"\"War\"\" multiplayer mode which is similar to Domination except that it's a proper staged battle across a map. The teams start either side and have to push towards the other team's base camp by capturing the flags as they go. The more you capture, and the more kills you get, the more 'momentum' your team builds. More momentum means quicker flag captures and respawns, which in effect rewards you for teamplay. The better you play as a team, the easier it becomes for you to overwhelm the opposing team with force.In addition, there are now vehicles in some multiplayer maps - typically tanks. They have two positions - driver/gunner and machinegunner, so up to two players can get in and roam around the map reaping destruction. There are vehicle challenges to go with this new feature - miles driven, most people killed with the main gun etc., and there are also anti-tank weapons and sticky mines so that foot-soldiers stand some chance of taking out the armour. This is a nice touch but I can't help but wonder if it was put in in an effort to compete with the Battlefield series of games.As with COD4 there are instant rewards in multiplayer. Three kills and you get aerial reconaissance, meaning you can see the other team's locations on your map. Five in a row and you get artillery. Seven in a row and you get to call in the dogs. Opinion is split on the dogs. Some people preferred the helicopter in COD4, but I sort of like the dogs idea. If you're quick, you can actually defend yourself against a dog attack. With the helicopter, you had no choice but to hide.New to World at War is cooperative gameplay. This is where you can play with other players instead of against them. For example having 4 of you locked in the nazi zombie level, or trying to complete campaign missions with 3 other players instead of the computer-controlled AI characters. This is a nice addition and it has all its own awards and challenges to be completed too.The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code still isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a \"\"host ended session\"\" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. In World At War, they do seem to have tried to implement code that migrates the host but it doesn't seem to work. Worse still, the send-you-to-the-same-game bug is still very prominent. If you're playing online and you decide you want out of the game, you can quit and go back to the multiplayer lobby. The problem is that if you then try to find another game, it will invariably dump you right back into the one you just left. Worse still, they still haven't solved the issue where it dumps you into games that have either just ended, or are within a couple of points of ending. This means you spend a considerable amount of time being shuttled from host to host just trying to find a game that is about to start. This and this alone is why I took a star off the review for this game. It was bad in COD4 and it should have been fixed. The fact that these problems still exist is inexcusable.TrophiesWorld At War supports the PS3's new trophy system. There are dozens to collect both in single player, multiplayer online and co-op modes.Four stars or five?Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. Developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of the PS3. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely although because of the improvements over COD4 I was willing to go the 5-star route. The improvements in the game engine, the sound effects, the smoke and explosion effects, and the engaging gameplay all help to raise the bar, but as I said above, the fact that it still suffers the abominable problems with multiplayer hosting are reason enough to bring the rating down again.It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the server glitches, still has a high X-factor. As with COD4 it's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like, but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD-WAW has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.\"", "\"Like a lot of people, the idea of going back to World War II didn't seem as exciting and this idea was further made problematic when developing team Treyarch (the maligned Call of Duty 3) was doing it as opposed to Infinity Ward who made the immensely-popular Modern Warfare. While I thought it was an intense shooter, it was also infuriating at times and certain parts were not fun at all though the experience as a whole was awesome. Taking that same engine and bringing it to the past has the game maintain that sense of intensity but it's still not up to the standards that IV brought. As such, World at War is a fun shooter, it's exciting and worth the trip but it's possibly not the next Call of Duty experience you were hoping for.Story: Like Modern Warfare, you play as 2 soldiers (thankfully not one of them nicknamed something as ridiculous as \"\"Soap\"\") Pvt. Miller of the Unites States Army going through the jungles of Japan during the Pacific Theater whereas Pvt. Petrenko, a Red Army soldier is part of the Russian forces storming their way into Berlin. The problem really with going back to World War II is that we know the outcomes or at least the general idea of the different battles and while we're thankfully not doing D-Day again, there's still a feeling like there's no real sense of plot progression like the hunt for the terrorist in Modern Warfare, we're just going somewhere until the game says \"\"okay, stop\"\".Graphics: One thing that always bugged me in a lot of war shooters is that the environments tended to be mainly bombed out cities, thick jungles or fields surrounded by the occasional barn and house. While World at War doesn't shift away from this tradition entirely, it's a bit more immersive and the linear and obvious routes are overshadowed by the real sense of scale and activity in a level. Character models are a bit more improved, destructible environments (some anyway) and some changes from a tank mission to manning a turret firing at enemy ships and fighters, it may not blow the roof off but it's certainly impressive.Sound/Music: Just as awesome as with any war shooter is the sound mix from the explosions and gunfire to barking commanders issuing orders, it certainly does feel like we're in a warzone. Also contributing is Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman who act as your Cpt. Price role for this game and both of them are just perfect with their loud and \"\"animated\"\" line readings. What might be a bit of a problem is the music which can shift from choirs and synths to straight up rock guitars and while I will admit it's strange hearing modern music in a WWII shooter, there was a couple of times where I have to say it added to the whole scene.Gameplay: The controls are still the same from grenade throwing to carrying 2 weapons at once and throwing back grenades when the prompt comes up but there's not really much else that has changed. Weaponry is not as fast-firing as before, reloading is a bit more slower and for the Russian sections, smoke grenades and flash bangs have been replaced with molotov cocktails. However, this naturally means that enemies also have access to these and they seem to know how to use them better than you since they'll frequently \"\"cook\"\" the grenade (keeping it in your hand than throwing so it explodes seconds after being tossed) resulting in quick deaths and in the most irritating of programming, they seem to throw grenades just as you spawn in the checkpoint and you die literally seconds after starting. While they're not as frequent, I just had to laugh when it did, chuckling at the hilarity of it then curse them out.Then of course there's the enemies having better accuracy and I'll frequently be aiming for that one fraction of an enemy body that's in view but not get a single shot in whereas if I poke my head around the corner, the red circle and fading colors already start appearing. But when life gives you lemons, you broil those buggers thanks to your flamethrower. While it doesn't pop up frequently, being able to wave your nozzle around and fry any enemy in your path has a depraved awesomeness. Melee attacks are also not instant kills as pressing R3 before the enemy stabs you and you grab it, grab your knife and plunge it into their neck. Speaking of which, this is a bit more gorier than Modern Warfare and while I didn't run into a lot of \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\"-type moments of nastiness, it's there and makes it a bit more impactful.The multiplayer is pretty much the same except the maps are huuuuge and the shift seems to be more about sneaking up on players or snipering people from a distance as opposed to the quicker-paced firefights of most FPS multiplayers. Where the fun comes is \"\"Zombie Mode\"\" which is unlocked after beating the main campaign (sorry co-op players, have to unlock it solo campaign) and the premise is basically you and up to 3 others acting in an Alamo-esque manner has you defend against wave after wave of zombie nazis that get tougher the more you go. While this feels like the PS3's answer to \"\"Gears of War 2\"\" and it's Horde mode, it's a blast to play and I bet many people will gravitate towards this one.Recommending World at War is a tricky business since on one hand, Modern Warfare did things a bit better yet this game isn't an embarassment or just some uninspired rehash. Yes it's World War 2 again, it's Nazis and it feels like IV brought back a good 60 years...but it's so fun that honestly I didn't mind.\"", "Close your eyes and imagine it was 1941 and you been drafted in to the war...and you can imagine what this game looks like. Your in the mist of World War 2 and the war is intense.  This is definitely not for the squeamish.  The game is intense, with very high levels of detail and gore.  There are a lot of curse words and slurs used throughout the game to give it a more real feeling of the time.The game play is excellent, and stands up to the Call of Duty franchise level of quality.  There are multiple stages in the game and some require brute force, others sneaking around buildings and sniping, while others force you into the air to shoot down boats and planes.  It's a very diverse game that will have you playing for hours on end. When you beat it, you get unlock a special stage where you fight ZOMBIES!!!The story mode can be finished in a day or two depending on how bad you want it.  There are PS trophies you can earn for completing certain objectives in the game.  These trophies allow you to go online and compare with your friends, and show off who has more trophies.  Bragging rights if you will.The funnest part of COD is the online mode.  You can play with up to 16 players online and battle for victory in an assortment of matches.  Some require you to capture the flag, hold down a fort, bomb the others building, or straight death matches.  Many varieties to choose from.  The plasyatation network online play is free and you will be on there for hours.  Games this intense and fun do not get old fast.  You will always have someone to play with you online, and chat about the strageties you are using and what not.Activision will no doubt be releasing updates to this game to add stages online later on, which I am sure they will be charging for.This is a great buy since it doesn't get old when there is always someone to play online.  I highly recommend it.  See you online in Team Deathmatch!", "\"Since most gamers are probably a lot younger than me, I'll give a review from an older person's view. This is more on an old school game. If you're looking for a game like COD4 with a modern theme, and advanced weapons, this game will might disappoint you. World at War is a great game, but this game is not really a sequel. It is an entirely different game and theme. This is what COD3 should have been. It takes the COD series back to it's WWII roots. It's not perfect though. It has its minor glitches, and the the single player is a little short. But it's a huge improvement to COD3. For those that feel the old WWII theme might bore you, it does have a bonus mode called \"\"Nacht der Untoten\"\", or Night of the Undead. You get to fight Nazi zombies. The game features excellent graphics and sound. The gameplay is very good. There are enough modes to keep the game fresh. All in all, I give it 4.5 stars. 5 stars for people like me that enjoyed the original WWII themed COD games, and 4 stars for the corwd that enjoyed COD 4 better.\"", "I remember when i started playing call of duty games, the first one was really good, all though a bit of a copy of medal of honor games that came out first, still, the genre was relatively new and much fun could be had with it.Now, 4 COD's later, this thing is plain old and boring. The makers of the series did a smart thing with COD 4 Modern Warfare,the game brought new technology, scenarios and situations to the genre, and it was excellent fun, a good rest from the back to back world war II shooters that had been beaten to death.Now with world at war, they again resort to the same old formula, and one that only took them a year to launch after COD 4 was released, probably meaning so much of it is a rehash of what they've done a million times before, that it didn't even take them much of an effort to make.Aside from the gameplay, story and situations being just extremely boring and old, there ain't much to look at graphics wise, they basically used the same engine from COD 4, which is not a bad engine, but it's over a year old and doesn't bring anything amazing to the table.My advice?, if you played one or two of these call of duty games before, you'll be getting nothing new with this one, certainly not worth the 60 dollar price. For that kind of dough some sort of innovation is needed, not revamps of 10 year old games.", "Like my other experiences with the Call of Duty series, World at War falls into the same line; short. Though some might argue that it depends on what difficulty you're playing on, but I'd like a game to be fun and immersive to everyone on any level, you know worth the money you spent on it. That being said Call of Duty: World at War falls short. I overly enjoyed the fact that you played in both theatres of World War II, but I hated how it compressed the entire war into 14-15 missions. This had so much potential to be a truly epic WWII fps. The gamplay is standard for the COD series, and like the other ones, with some controlla adjustmens, became very intuitive. The online play is also cliche, and has its moments too. Now where I think this game shines isn't the campaign or the online muitiplayer, but Nazi Zombies. I was blown away by it. Not by the graphical presentation, not by anything of the nature, but by how fun it is. That may not be much to say, but in a day and age where technical achievments are almost held higher than fun gameplay, it shines in my book. In the end COD: WAW is a desent game, nothing too speacial, nothing too awful. At the price it's at now, it's a great pick.", "Not even all the way through and I like it better than COD Modern Warfare. It seems like it plays longer and is more challenging.  There are two missions I could do without but the rest are great.  I love the jungle warfare as opposed to the city fighting in Modern Warfare.  More natural terrain to be concerned with.  In the city it's pretty much the same, room-to-room.  In the jungle you have no clue what you'll encounter.  Truly adds to the difficulty which in turn makes it more fun for me.", "After playing a year of Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, it took a while to get use to the new World at War.  World at War is an amazing game!  I still love Modern Warfare, but there has been so much more improvements to WAW.  The game is more 'brutal' meaning parts and guts splatter all over for realism.  Graphic wise, WAW is a bit more sharper and cleaner looking.  The sound is top notch amazing, being a sound guru myself.  After playing WAW for a few months and going back to Modern Warfare, the sound is really muffled and not as strong and intense as WAW.The only drawback about WAW is that I personally don't really like the good ol' day guns back then.  The pace in WAW is also a lot slower, weapons and the action is also a bit on the slow pace.  Modern Warfare, is a faster, run and gun pace especially on-line.  Overall, I thought Modern Warfare was better, but now I think WAW is just as good or even better because of the improvements from COD4.  This is a must buy for a shooter!  It will be in my collection, playing and awaiting for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 coming in 2009!", "Shoot, die and keep shooting.  B/W COD 4 and 5, 5 is a bit better just b/c you can distinguish b/w the enemy and your troops.  Your troops btw don't die if you shoot or torch them.  Overall, if you want to relieve some stress and you don't have hours to play, this is the perfect game to kill you over until Resident Evil 5 comes out.  I haven't played online yet, and I'm not completely through the entire game either, but so far I can tell you that you will kill and die more times than you can remember.  You will need the dual shock controller for this game.  I bought this used for 49.99.  I thought the price was a bit high for the game play.Update: Bought and sold Resident Evil 5.  I'm back to playing Call of Duty and Bioshock, so far my two favorites.", "Personally, I do not like this game.  It is very hard to control.  It is different for the other game.  You always move to the wrong direction.", "Great game. Call of Duty, the series is perfect and is exciting and fun to play. This one is Good, play it you will like it.", "I'm new to the COD franchise. I DID have my eye on Modern Warfare, but now I think I'll pass (or at least wait until I can get it used for cheap). I played the campaign in under 6 hours and was getting pretty bored with it. The combat is pretty real and real brutal.  But I've had more fun and bigger challenges in other games.The campaign seems like more of an after-thought. It's like the creators built an on-line only game, but felt guilty for charging us $60 bucks for that, so threw together a campaign the night before it got released, just to ease their conscience.HOWEVER, I'm not a big fan of playing online, but WaW makes playing online fun. I actually enjoy it.  That's about all I've got to say.", "this is such a great Call of duty game! it is about world war, it switches character sometimes so you will never get bored of it!Pros:1- many levels.2- good graphics3- large variety of weapons!4- easy to understand controls5- zombie mode is the best!Cons!None", "This game can be described as extension pack to COD4. The game plays exactly the same as COD4. If they had released this game before COD4.. it would have been GOTY. Now after playing COD4, it is really not that much fun. WWII weapons are not that responsive,  they tried to mask as much as possible. IF you are hardcore world war 2 fan this is probably the one of the best. For normal FPS fans, it doesnt have the same legs as other 08 shooters.Instead of creating a new game all they did is repaint COD4 with WWII paint and released it. Every thing is WWII replacement. Air strikes are replaced with dogs, etc. Zombie survival is not as much as fun as R2 or Gears co-op. Also the game single player mission is really short. If you have played COD games before and can play without dying; it can be finished in one sitting.Wait for it to hit bargain bins or just go back to COD4. I hope they dont ruin the COD franchise with cheap re-spins like this.", "This Game Is Really Fun, Even After Modern Warfare Came Out. In Addition Of Having Nazi Zombies And Map Packs Available For Download, This Game Is A Must Buy For All Ps3 Owners.", "Get it if your a WW2 fan, if you like shooting things, of if your named Adolf.", "I ordered the game used for like 6 bucks here on Amazon.It came today,so I thought Id give it a test run to make sure it played properly since it was used.What started as a test run,ended up being 6 1/2 hours of non-stop action...and I had to quit,otherwise Id be up all night.This game is completely awesome.Ive played previous WW2 games on various systems over the years,but this just tops them.The firefights are brutal and intense.The enemy AI is great.The sound and graphics are amazing.I was honestly getting burnt out on the WW2 fps theme.But Im glad I gave this a chance.It is really graphic,bloody and brutal...hence the Mature rating.If you are into war fps then you have to add this title to your library.I cant wait to continue the game tomorrow.", "\"Despite those words echoing in my head from my friends recommendation of \"\"Buy this game, just remember dude..... IT'S NOT BY INFINITY WARD\"\". Campaign is awesome, Multiplayer is everything you would expect from COD. & Zombie Nazis!?!?! FUGGHEDABOUTIT! Its like it was custom tailored just for me!!!!!!! however it is missing a certain \"\"IT\"\" factor that infinity wards brings, just a tad bit of polish is missing from it! Still a 5 out of 5 but as your playing this game let Jose's warning haunt you too \"\"IT'S NOT MADE BY INFINITY WARD DUDE\"\"\"", "\"This is IMO the best COD game.  Its simple, stripped down and yet its still a challenge.  The story mode is very well put together with a lot of change in environments, characters, missions, and weapons.  WaW's storyline is also fun to follow, WWII wasn't called \"\"the good war\"\" for nothing.  One map you are burning out Japanese in trenches, the next you are clearing German foot forces out of buildings.  Great stuff.  Russians are always fun to play as.Zombie mode made this game.  Its what started many people to playing COD and in my case, playing PS3 period.  The concept of an unbeatable game that just gets harder and harder was kind of new.  Hoard modes really weren't popular until this either.  Zombie mode is something that is the same concept, but different everytime you play it.  With 4 rather large maps with different aspects (traps, perks, weapons, interaction) this mode alone makes the game worth playing.Online play will test your skills.  Killstreaks are classic 3kill, 5kill, 7kill setup.  There are no overpowered weapons (most people will argue the MP40 ruined online, but a small highpowered SMG was required to counteract the increased health Juggernaut perk IMO).  There is a lot of gore.  The perks are balanced.  The sniper rifles are some of the most realistic that COD has ever had as far as damage.  It even seems they have taken into account the type of bullets the guns shoot (I have noticed that guns shooting 9mm rounds will hit their target before guns shooting 45acp)  The maps are really thought out, not ill conceived notions designers have ripped off of story mode.All in all, its worth the buy.  Would I pay 60 for it?  Probably not, but now that WaW has been out, I'm sure you can pick it up somewhere reasonable.  Really, there are too many mixed opinions about this game.  Research it for yourself.  Some love it, some hate it.  I personally see no reason to dislike it.  I go by this:  Can I beat a game, pick it up months after all sorts of new awesome games have come out, and still be like Holy **** this is fun!  With this game, I can.\"", "I don't want to go into too much detail here, because who honestly doesn't know about this game? Well, essentially, its the WWII version of COD4, which is one of the best games ever, despite the fact of it being branded with the horrible name (Nowadays) of Call of Duty. Multiplayer is the basically the same as COD4, single player is essentially the same formula (Which is good, COD4 was amazing), and instead of the extra mode of Arcade as in COD4, they added multiplayer campaign! Awesome! As well as the fact of the introduction of the now famous Tryarch Zombie mode, which is worth this game alone (Especially on PC, with all the custom maps)! Must buy for any WWII or FPS fan! The last of the great COD... which in my opinion, COD 4 and WAW were the only truly great ones... GET THIS NOW!", "thought i reviewd this once. well yeah its a good game yep. sort of like cod4 with zombies and old looking....go get it, zombies are fun", "COD WaW is way different than COD4.  The first thing you notice is the grainy (almost Sepia) quality of the graphics.  That said, the cut scenes and the graphics are better that COD4.  Unlike anything made by Ubisoft or Unreal (IMHO their games blow), this games smokes all of the competition.Cooperative play is an interesting new feature to the COD series.  You can play in split-screen mode with another player.  Basically, it's solo mode for two (if that makes any sense).  If your comrade is injured, your have to find him and administer first-aid otherwise you both die.  I have 2 HDTVs and 2 PS3s and sprung for a second copy so my son and I can play cooperatively.  It's really cool playing zombie in cooperatiive play.  Oh yeah, don't forget to get your raygun in the second level.  Check youtube for some good glitches -- especially the one on the second floor in zombie mode (bring a flamethrower and an LMG).  Cooperative play on a smaller screens just doesn't work.I completed solo play in Veteran mode and it took about 20 hours.  Yeah, you get killed a lot and it takes forever to complete a mission -- but that's the point.  War isn't running into a room full of enemies and hosing them down with your machine gun without getting a scratch.  It's about tactics, planning and killing the enemy without getting yourself killed.  In Veteran mode, you have no choice other than to plan your moves, use the terrain to your advantage and proceed cautiously.  Simply put; it's hard to survive.  For some reason, I completed a level where you clear out the artillery from the Japanese caves but it doesn't register as a checkpoint so I got stuck and couldn't continue.  If you get stuck like I did the download a saved game from the Internet (for free).Other reviewers said they completed the game in under 10 hours.  I doubt it can be done that quickly unless they're playing at the Rookie level.  No way at Veteran level.There's some cool new fetures too: you can drive and fire a tank, and then there's also a flamethrower.  The tank is OK and the trick is to hang back and take out opponents one at a time -- using the landscape as cover against other tanks.  If you're up to flaming-up the enemy and watching them burn (some burning much more energetically than others), then this is a ton of fun in a sick kind of way.  In story mode, I've done entire levels with only the flamethrower despite its limited range (even though I was packing a LMG too).  This is possible because Activision programmed in a feature that the enemy doesn't shoot at you until you get close when holding the flamethrower.  You can prove this by switching to another weapon and you instantly get shot at.  It's a bunch of fun to burn down trees too.  A word of caution: You can burn yourself up if you walk into the flames.In Veteran story mode, ammo conservation is always an issue.  While your teamates seems to have an unlimited supply of ammo, you don't.  Swapping your weapon for an enemy's drop is an option but not in all cases.  For example, you don't want to drop your sniper rifle for a machine gun.  You're better off locating enemies using the scope and picking them off using a lesser weapon that you have a bunch of ammo for.Online play is good once you level-up to some decent weapons.  Keep in mind this is WWII so there's no lasers, night-vision and barely any scoped weapons.  Automatics are slow and not too accurate.  It takes several body shots to drop a target.  I find myself going for head-shots because a single shot does the job.  There's a new level called Bootcamp that you can play until Level 8.  There's a glitch that you can exploit to level-up more quickly.  Once you're in Bootcamp you can stay there indefinately as long as you don't leave.  In other words, you can level up to 44 in about 8 hours in Bootcamp.This game is rated M for Mature.  The rating is justified because there is some pretty graphic material and language.  For example, when you step on a land mine your legs get blown off.  This is way more intense than COD4.", "So i guess i was wrong. COD5 ended up to be a great game after all. My friends and i were on the fence with this game from the very beginning and who can blame us. Going back to world war 2. Infinity Ward was not apart of the project. and... what could be better than Modern Warfare?Well, i'm still not decided if this game is better than COD4 but if it isn't... it's at least JUST AS GOOD... JUST AS FUN... JUST AS ADDICTING.Campaign mode was a blast.Graphics are still awesome.Controls are exactly the same.Multiplayer has changed but not necessarily in a bad way. Tanks have been implented. 7 straight kills and you'll have the ability to call the dogs on the opponents. levels are more interactive in terms of barrels exploding...it's a great game. And even though COD4 will still be my favorite for now i've been hooked on this game and i dont think i'll be playing 4 for awhile. Especially since trophies have been implented and it just brings more challenges and more reasons to play.", "After being blown away by Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and thankfull for finally getting a change of scenery, I wasn't looking forward to Call of Duty: World at War at all.  Really? World War II again after last year's smashing game set in the modern day?  Well, yeah, that's what you get here, but luckily, World at War isn't just a newer version of an old game with a semi-fresh coat of paint.  Thankfully, World at War plays very much like Modern Warfare, from the grim and gritty tone to the excellent multiplayer modes.  Alternating between the American and Russian POV's, World at War offers a compelling story and plenty of exciting (and violent) moments to be had.  The game looks gorgeous with some brilliant audio quality as well, and the four-player co-op campaign mode is a nice addition as well.  Other multiplayer modes are carried over from Modern Warfare, and are still a blast to play.  Not to mention that including new weapons like the flamethrower and bayonet, and the unlockable Nazi Zombies co-op mode is worth the price of admission alone, and is insanely fun to play.  All in all, even though Activision has taken the Call of Duty franchise back to World War II, don't let that put you off to Call of Duty: World at War.  It's the best WWII-based FPS to see the light of day in a while, and is definitely worth your time.", "I buy COD games strictly for the multiplayer, surprisingly that was the weakest aspect of this installment.Multiplayer - 8/10The strongest part of the multiplayer experience is the maps.  This game has the best maps in the whole series as far as I am concerned.  They look great too.  The downfall to multiplayer is the lack of customization.Singleplayer - 10/10I've had a blast with the single player experience.  Who doesn't like being talked to by Jack Bauer himself?ZOMBIES 20/10This is the greatest part of this game.  I've spent countless hours playing this original game mode where you have to survive against waves of zombie attackers.", "Just like all the magazine reviews; the story is great and the online is great!", "\"COD World At War is a great game, I personally think it is a good follow up to Modern Warfare, however i still think going back to WWII is a bad move for the \"\"Call of Duty\"\" franchise. But again the COD isn't in any danger with this new installment. Infinity Ward (the ones dat made modern warfare) didn't do this one, Treyarch (da ones dat did COD 3) created this one but still has the same feel as Modern Warfare.The campaign is great but not as great as Modern Warfare. There are missions that vary from running and gunning to mobile tanks, or shooting a gunnary from and airship, all in all the campaign is good and definetly beats Call of Duty 3's campaign by miles. After you beat the game there is a NAZI ZOMBIES mode where your in a house with killing all the zombies that you can before you die. This mode a fun added extra to the game and is definetly fun w/ co-cp. The multiplayer is basically da same as COD4 with barracks, challenges, class customizations, level-up rankings w/ prestige, perks etc. The only real difference is the addition of mobile vehicles such as tanks.GAMEPLAY - the gameplay is the same, but dats not a bad thing. The controls are perfect, the enemies are pretty smart, your comrads however are not, but overall gameplay is good. 9/10GRAPHICS - World At War uses the same graphics engine as COD4, and the lushious vegetation, smoke effects and character models are beautiful. In full HD, you can't help but appreciate the beauty of this game. The explosions are epic and the gory blood when people are killedare juicy and gruesome. haha I LOVE IT!!! 10/10SOUND - one word...INCREDIBLE. It feels like your really at the battles of WWII. The voice actors are believable and the overall atmoshpere is great. 10/10MULTIPLAYER - Awesome!!! if you love the multiplayer from COD4 den you'll love this. 10/10Bascially world at war isn't a new game, but more of an expansion of some sorts from COD4, but i still think the game is great. I recommend you buy it.\"", "Like most call of duty games the graphics are pretty incredible for this game as you go around the world fighting the axis of evil during WWII and in the Pacific you fight the powerful Empire Of Japan.  The controls by now are pretty straight forward and are the same apparently for all the COD games which is very appreciated since you don't have to worry about trying to learn new button controls,the effects and detail of the game are pretty incredible as you march you way through jungles, beachheads,  and war torn terrain to try and win the war for the people of the United States.  The game is obviously pretty gory so while not meant for the younger kids I still feel the mid to older teens should still be allowed to play the game(14-18) I mean we're starting to see just as much blood and violence on regular t.v. anyway.  The extras are pretty standard the usual multi-player or co-op but you got a nice little extras too Zombie Nazi's as you try and defend your sanctuary from the hordes of flesh eating Nazis who are trying to get in the longer you last the more points add up for you.  Like with COD modern Warfare 2 you'll hear some known actors from time to time most recognizable is Keifer Sutherland(Lost Boys/24).  Now some might feel this is a little racist on the Japanese people for having the game like this but being half Japanese I found no insult about that part of the game which sadly for that time the country of Japan was a brutal and viscous empire doing cruel and inhuman atrocities during this time as well(Though sadly what country hasn't committed such heinous crimes during their more darker eras).So for any FPS fan of those just looking for an enjoyable game in general here's a pretty good choice to add to your gaming library..."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.006598916370421648, 0.0074904607608914375, 0.01945987530052662, 0.09174015372991562, 0.02599981240928173, 0.029004773125052452, 0.045381736010313034, 0.002917252015322447, 0.034806907176971436, 0.004120988305658102, 0.023756373673677444, 0.025072839111089706, 0.04463702440261841, 0.07796885818243027, 0.03057359904050827, 0.013974251225590706, 0.05765649303793907, 0.04444458335638046, 0.04107363522052765, 0.030747229233384132, 0.004487039986997843, 0.03022123873233795, 0.006246098317205906, 0.01670742593705654, 0.06619110703468323, 0.030353832989931107, 0.034305717796087265, 0.009433818981051445, 0.061819031834602356, 0.0461667999625206, 0.00047996590728871524, 0.036162130534648895]]}
