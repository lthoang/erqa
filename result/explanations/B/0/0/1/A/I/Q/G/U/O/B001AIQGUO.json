I wanted something i can primarily use to pre-record webinars, but also skype calls. First, this mic was in people-proof packaging. Everyone hates that. Next, it came with 2 strange accessories that are supposed to be stands, I think. No instructions. Nothing. You figure it out. One stand flew out of the packaging and across the room when I was attempting to liberate it from its plastic prison. No damage to it though. Mic feels great in the hand, but sound quality always 100% of the time has high background noise - sounds like street \"\"roar\"\" or white background noise (all windows were closed and no noise was coming from outside. the room was completely quiet except for my voice). I changed the bass/noise reduction setting and it had NO EFFECT. Just to be sure it was not my imagination, I tested it with a Creative mic/headset combo i've been using for 2 years. The sound quality of the Creative headset was only slightly, slightly less than this CAD mic. Not enough to warrant keeping the CAD mic. I could suppress noise made with the Creative headset with my audio/video editing software, but the noise would not suppress when the recording was done by the CAD mic. I don't know where it's picking up this background white noise but it is s 100% unacceptable. And while they're at it, fix the packaging problem and consider including - wait for it - instructions - so your customers actually know how to use your products. Back it goes.\"", "I needed a microphone for recording my voice for voice-overs in my videos, so I decided to buy this. It's a very nice mic, also nice and professional looking as well. Audio quality is amazing, I can hear my voice crisp and clear, also works good for Skype as well. Only downside is it didn't come with directions on how to setup the mic stand, so it did take a little time to figure it out but I managed to get it working. Overall it's a great mic if you want to record your voice for any reason.", "Bought this as a gift for someone looking to start streaming computer game-play. He loves the mic, and claims that it does an extraordinary job recording and chatting.Downside is that it took him a while to configure it properly. He still runs into little problems from time to time with it picking up an echo.", "I just wanted a microphone to hook up to my PC that didn't sound horrible.  All the analog mics connectd to the sound card mic input sounded awful.  This little gem is great.  Excellent voice recordings, no background noise, choice of sensitivity setting, and plug and play ease of use.I cannot say enough about this mic.  It truly is a great quality microphone.Only gripe was the inluded stand - like others, It took me a while to figure out how to assemble and get the ring back on to the bottom of the mic.  But that's small potatoes.This is an excellent mic for voice recording.  That's all I needed it for, so have not tried it for anything else.", "\"I bought this to make voice recordings of study skill information that I sell. I am by no means a professional in this area of sound recording. As a matter of fact, I am using Audacity, which for my purposes, and being free, works quite well.Here are my observations after a week of use:1. The CAD U37 produces very clear sound. It is quite sensitive, but there are some switches on the front that allow useful adjustment.2. The size is very good. It has the \"\"feel\"\" of a much more expensive microphone, and the silver color it just fine.3. It does have a blue LED on the front which does pulsate when you are recording, but this does not bother me in the least.4. It installed by simply plugging it into an avaliable USB port. It took Win 7 Pro 64 about 40 seconds to install the drivers and it was ready to go. Easy.5. The U37 has a tripod type stand into which the microphone is easily positioned. The height and angle are of the microphone are easily adjusted. The 10' USB cable, which affixes to the bottom of the device, that comes with the U37 is more than adequate, and in my opinion, having handled hundreds, if not thousands of USB cables, is a quality product.6. The seller got it to me on time and in perfect condition. That is commendable and appreciated.So, here's the bottom line: it is easy to use, and is truly a very affordable microphone that produces, in my opinion, very clear, professional quality sound. In terms of price and performance, it is hard, and I mean really hard to beat.\"", "Salaam Aleikum, LONG LIVE THE IRANIAN EMPIRE AND IIA, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN!Total junk!  This microphone seems to have a tin noise to it.  No matter how many adjustments one makes to the settings on the microphone itself or to the software settings, it doesn't go away.  NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!", "I am disappointed with this microphone. It works reasonably well with male voices. However, it adds a certain amount of harshness. It is hard to describe - but it is as if a second high frequency element has been added to the voice. Not crystal clear neutral sounding. For female voices - at least when recording a little girl, don't even think about it. It sounds quite shrill. A beautiful childs voice sounds like it is coming out of a metal can tweeter. Shrill and un-pleasant. The mikes in my Tascam DR-40 do better than these.When you open up the microphone you will find that the electronics are not shielded in any way. This is because the case is plastic. In addition, when recording, I always get a slight offset (recording is not centered on zero). This problem does not arise if I were to use a computer mic or analyze the recordings from my Tascam DR-40.Many reviews will have you believe that this mike is made by CAD. It is not. They just resell this from Yoga electronics - and you can search the web for YG-130. This is an OK mic for the price. I'm now looking at the AT2020 or the MXL 770 or 990 or a Blue Spark. I'll use a separate USB audio interface  - either M-Track or Focusrite. The spend will be quite a bit more. Hopefully I'll be able to get the sound I want - neutral and clear.", "I needed a better quality microphone to use for VOIP/gaming chats and the occasional commentary for Youtube videos. I didn't see the need to spend the $100+ price point of popular mics like theBlue YetiorAudio-Technica AT2020, nor did I want to skimp and pick up something in the lower price range like theZalman Mic1.  Just wanted a middle of the road model that'll make voice recordings sound better than the built-in mic on my laptop.After doing some research I found this mic and it got enough good reviews and was in a perfect price point so I decided to try one out.Setup was easy with the microphone. Windows 7 instantly installed the drivers through the USB plug/play connection.  I keep the switches at -10 for the top and the straight line for the bottom bass reduction setting.  I also went into the Control Panel > Sound > Recording tabs and changed a few of the properties to get better sound:CUSTOM - UNCHECK AGCLEVELS - Moved the slider to 50ADVANCED - Change from CD to DVD quality (1 channel, 16 bit, 48000hz)I then went into my Realtek Audio Manager (every computer will be different so you'll need to research which soundcard your computer has to find your exact settings) and unchecked any microphone 'boost' settings.Then I loaded up Audacity (free sound editing program) and recorded some voice samples at different angles/distances.  The pickup of the mic was pretty good at all tests.  I use it positioned directly in front of my mouth about 6-8 inches away and the audio is extremely clear with little to no background noise.  Most importantly though is there is no fuzzy/static sound at all.  Instead of picking up a bulky pop filter or even a windscreen I simply took a clean sock and covered the mic to help prevent any spit getting into the mouthpiece.  Comparing the voice samples covered/uncovered, the simple sock works pretty well to help tone down any sharp sounds.  It also has the benefit of covering the blue LED from shining in your face.  Talking to a few family/friends on Skype and in games they almost all commented on how much better I sounded from the built-in mic. Job done.I did take off a star though for a fairly annoying problem.  The USB connection is very finnicky.  Any reposition or slight movement in the USB cable will disconnect the mic.  Not sure if my mic is just defective or if this is a common problem with the mics. Please leave a comment or message to let me know if you have any issues with yours please.  A simple jiggle on the cable fixes it so I'm not going to bother sending back for a replacement .... yet.Overall though, this is a good microphone for voice commentary and sets up easily.  Very clean natural sounding voice recording and has just enough features/accessories to make it worth the price.  Recommended.", "I'm very impressed with the quality of this microphone. I use it for an online radio show, and so far, it works great. Hopefully it holds up like some of the mics from CAD that I have used in the past.", "I game and do professional recordings and this is the ticket for under $80 and puts a smile on your face when you hear its said and done. 5 STARS all the WAY BOTH HANDS DOWN & FEET ! Makes me sound like a MAN!", "I give this product 5 stars for the reason that the sound it records is great. I had a problem in the beginning, because i set up the microphone and the sound was good, but when i had someone with a higher and deeper voice the recording sound was bad. So to fix the problem i had to set up the mic with the person to get the sound levels balance, after that it was recording good.", "Husband uses this mic for his weekly internet radio show, and he's said repeatedly that he's just not happy with it. It runs really hot, so it picks up a lot of background noise, and he just can't dial it in to where he's really happy with it. He still uses it, but I'm guessing it won't last in our household too long.", "This microphone works very well.  It was built to be fairly sturdy and lightweight.  It was packaged with a USB cord, stand, and shock resistor.  That's the little bolt-like thing that keeps the mic from shaking while on the stand. The price was incredibly low, so low in fact that even I bought it.  I was originally shopping for a headset in the $40-60 range.  I had settled on a headset but saw two condenser microphones in the recommendations.  They got my curious and a good review about this microphone totally sold me on the idea of purchasing one of these.I am glad I purchased this thing.  Sound quality is great, maybe not perfect but very clear.  I get a lot of complements about the clarity of my voice on Skype already.  I am also using the mic to record piano sessions and voice-overs and similar projects, and it has not given me any difficulties.  The mic has lasted a week with no problems and was completely plug-and-play.The only problem I have now is the lack of an on/off switch.  That would be very handy.  Currently, I just unplug the mic when not using it.", "\"I was having problems with my Win7 Ultimate computer system recognizing my Snowball USB mic. Just stopped working? Soooooo onto Amazon I went to do some research. This mic fits the bill with a desktop stand and USB cable. The included mic base ring contains the standard thread pattern so you could mount this mic on many of the standard bases depending on your usage.Unpack it, assemble it, plug it in; and you'll be up and running. Win7 recognized it and a Skype test confirmed everything was working properly. Make sure you go into the Control Panel and make this USB mic the audio input device and bypass the mic on you USB webcam. Be sure that Win7 doesn't recognize it as a USB speaker.This mic should show up as \"\"C-media USB device\"\" on the hardware page.It looks nice on the desk next to the monitor and works just fine off to the side. Adjustable sensitivity and bass make it easy to change some of the audio qualities if you need to. Great mic,desktop base,USB cable, pro wanna-be worthy, and much cheaper that some of the pro-quality stuff at $250 and up.FYI- When your computer is up and running there is a little blue led on the front that stays on. When you access Skype or some sound program requiring a mic it will begin to flash so you know it is \"\"in use\"\". I guess you could lower the brightness of the little blue light with a \"\"black Sharpie\"\" if the light annoys you.....or wait for the led to burn out after 20,000 hours. Blue light update: use a tiny piece of duct tape instead.....!!Skpe or podcasting all works great............Don't know about making music, someone else can evaluate that....\""], "Gamma":
