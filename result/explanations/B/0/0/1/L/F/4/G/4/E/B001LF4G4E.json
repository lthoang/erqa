"], "reviews": ["I had previously received the Remington S9950 a few months ago so I had that to compare this one to. Although they're both from the same company, the Remington S9950 is a much better flat iron. The only plus to this one is that it comes with a DVD that guides you but besides that it's not that great at what it does. This one tends to catch your hair and it doesn't heat up as well as the other one does. Like I said it's just ok at what it does. If you have the time to sit for a while to get your hair straight then this is for you. If you don't then I would suggest getting something else.", "\"I think this is a nice, middle of the road, straightener.  The price is decent, it works well, and has some nice features.  My favorite feature is the auto shut off, believe it or not.  It has given me great piece of mind as I'm driving to work on those hectic mornings, no more wondering,  \"\"DID I shut off the iron?\"\"As I don't actually use the iron as a straightener, but rather, as a curling iron, I can't remark on how effective it is at straightening.  As a curler, it doest the job.  It's perfect for flips.  And, I know that Remington is a product name that I can trust.  So, I imagine this little iron will keep working for a long time.I also have to remark on the DVD that came with it.  It was really pretty informative and a nice bonus.\"", "The hair straightener heated up and cooled down quickly, which was very convienent.  It did not snag any of the hair and straightened well, even at the lowest setting.  I did not like the placement of the on/off switch.  I kept turning the iron off accidently.  Holding my hand higher on the shaft was too hot, holding my hand lower, was too awkard.  All in all, it was good if they move the on/off switch.  It did a great job.", "This is a great flat iron. It straightens my short hair beautifully and leaves it with a healthy shine and it lasts all day. There is no bad smell or any indication that it is damaging my hair. It also never pulls. I dont even need product after I use it.The plates are a pretty pink, while the body is a complementary wine color, making it feminine and a little fun. The controls are digital and default to 300 degrees, which I usually turn down a bit. I have traveled with it twice and it is so thin and streamlined it takes up no room at all!My favorite feature is that the cord can swivel 360 degrees, so you dont end up with a tightly wound cord. The cord is nice and long too, giving me more freedom to move around when Im doing my hair.", "\"Over the last year I have tested out several straighteners. This one rates somewhere in between my favorite (Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\"\") and my least (Remington S9950  Shine Therapy Straightener, 1\"\").Pros:~ Left my hair smooth and straight using the highest setting.~ Outside where you hold the plates closed stayed cool to the touch.~ The included DVD is great! Both my daughter and I learned several new ways to use our flat irons.Cons:~ To get my hair smooth and straight I had to go over each section 2-3 times.~ Took too long to heat up.~ The temperature lock worked, but because of the button placement I did end up turning it off a couple times.Because of my natural curl, I have found some straighteners work very well and others aren't worth my time. This one did do a good job, but the time it took get that result was far too much. I'd recommend theRemington S-1051 Sleek n Curl Tstudio Collection Titanium Straightner with Tourmaline 1\"\" Slim Platesto someone with a slight wave or curl looking to replace or purchase a new straightener and who might benefit from the informative, easy to follow DVD that it comes with.\"", "\"The Remington Tourmaline-Titanium-Ceramic Digital Flat Iron is an 1\"\" hair straightener with a slim design. It comes with a DVD with tips including how to curl your hair using this straightener. It really works, I curled my hair using my straightener, who knew. As for straightening, it worked beautifully. The design has curved edges so it is easy to roll a flip at the end of your hair to give it a little style.Pros:* Has a lock feature that you press and hold a button for 2 seconds and  it locks the digital display on so that you can't accidentally change the temp or turn it off.* Shuts off after 60 minutes for safety.* Swivel cord.* 4 yr. warranty* Comes with DVD tips.* Digital Temperature Display* Small Design, Only 10\"\" LongCons:No Storage Bag like theTRESemme Philips HP4669/05 Thermal Creations Straightener, 1\"\"My Personal Experience:* The unit has a knob on the side that you turn and lock it closed but mine doesn't work. No matter how hard I try to turn it, it pops back open.* Mine took a lot longer than 30 seconds to heat up.* My hair gets caught between the edge of the metal plates and the plastic and pulls strands of my hair out.Tips:* The booklet says do not heat in the locked position, I mention this because I have another straightener that says to heat it in the locked position for faster heat-up. I wanted to mention in case this may be different than what you are used to.* Use the lowest setting you need to prevent damage to your hair. I have course, thick hair and I use 390 and its plenty hot enough for my hair.Overall:I am still pleased with the performance of the Remington, even though I had a few problems because it is still a nice size and does a good job on my hair. This hair straightener makes my hair look the best of all the hair appliances that I own. I don't need to straighten and then get a curling iron out to give my hair a little style, with this Remington, I can do it all with one product.\"", "\"I must agree with the other reviews, this is an effective product for the price. And like other reviewers here, I have a professional straightener that I mainly use, aT3 Tourmaline(because it is least likely to cause severe damage). However, as someone who travels extensively, I always like a less expensive iron for \"\"the road\"\" (that way if it breaks or I leave it behind, I won't feel as bad!!) The Remington fits this order nicely. (And I am a very selective consumer!)There were several positives with this Remington product. Foremost, this iron did not pull my hair (unlike some others with which I have recently experimented ... that literally pulled out strands of my hair!) Moreover, it quickly reached an effective heat (in about 30 seconds). (And, yes, it is digital, so there's no \"\"dial\"\" guesswork!!) Finally, since I am not a fan of larger plates, these one-inch plates were perfect for creating a variety of styles.If you are seeking a (cute) iron for travel, to leave at a significant other's apartment, or just for occassional use, then try the Remington Tstudio!! I think you will be pleasantly surprised!\"", "Let me just say that the DVD included with the Remington S-1051 Sleek n Curl Tstudio iron is worth the price of the tool, itself -- and this product is fabulous! The DVD presented the kind of information that stylists pick up at the International Hair Shows in Manhattan. The effects are stunning and the instruction is understandable for the novice, but sophisticated enough for the experienced operator.I am a retired New York City salon owner. I can honestly say that if I was still in that line of work and had seen this product demonstrated at one of the hair shows, I would have purchased one for every station in my shop -- even at a higher price.If you are in the market for a new styling tool, this one is highly recommended. And because of its versatility, it also makes a wonderful gift for anyone in your circle!", "As another reviewer said, the Remington Shine Therapy is a better flat iron for just $10 more.This iron works okay, but not as good as other flat irons I own. It does give you a DVD showing how to style your hair, but that was not a lot of help for me. I know how to use a flat iron. :)It has an automatic shut-off feature that turns off after an hour. Of course, this is a very nice feature. It's slim and compact. I did not find that it heats up extremely fast. I had to go over my hair a couple of times to get it straight like I like to wear it.All in all, it's an okay iron, but nothing spectacular at all.", "I have three different straighteners, ranging from your basic to the high end Chi.  This one did my hair nicely, but left it a bit rough-feeling.  I set the temperature much less than I usually do (I usually go for 390, but used this at 350) and it still dried my hair.  The controls are easy to read and use.  The only thing I'd like to see on this that my others have is a beep-notification that it's finished heating up.  I like the auto-off feature--very nice if you have kids in the house.It has a really long cord--something I don't need in my teeny bathroom, but would be beneficial if you are further away from your outlet.It's not my favorite, but it's not bad, especially for this price.", "This is a fabulous flat iron for the price!  While I wouldn't say that it straightened quite as nicely as my $120 Solia flat iron, it honestly came quite close to it, and is ages ahead of comparable ones I've tried in this price range in the past.This Remington flat iron is completely digital, both in terms of turning it on/off, and in terms of setting the temperature on it.  It comes with a small booklet that lets you know which temperatures to use, depending on your hair type, and it also completely warmed up in less than 30 seconds.Two other great features are that it automatically shuts off after an hour (a wonderful safety feature), and it also has a locking button, so that you can lock your preferred temperature in place and don't have to worry about accidentally hitting a wrong button while using it.Additionally, the flat iron has curved edges that make it easier to create curls and waves with it. The ceramic plates are also of a very nice quality, and they don't seem like they will chip or scratch easier.  It's difficult to find ceramic plates in this price range, and these seem very nice and didn't snag on my hair at all, as has happened with other models in the past.The flat iron also comes with a DVD that features a British stylist using the flat iron to achieve both flat and curly styles.  I learned quite a few tricks from watching this, and it was a great bonus item to include with the flat iron.When using a flat iron, also be sure to use a product that helps protect your hair. I usually use PHYTO's Phytodefrisant serum (on wet hair) or OSIS Flatliner spray (on dry hair) before using my flat iron.If you're looking for a moderately priced flat iron, then definitely check this one out!Updated on 5/25/09:  Other reviewers have mentioned that this flat iron ends up pulling out their hair, but I haven't had any problems with that issue.  However, that could be because I have short hair.", "My wife said this Remington sleek Curl Flat Iron was frosting on the cake after the dryer.  (Let's hope she meant frosting on all the cakes she is now going to bake.)She was amazed at the versatility of this iron.  She had always thought flat irons were only for long hair and those who wanted very straight long hair.  Not so.An added bonus for her is the swivel cord that does not tangle as the cord of her other curler did.Once again, there's that Remington 4 year warranty which, of course, appeals very much to me.And, who knows?  Now that she's so happy with this she may even let her hair grow!", "I don't like where the buttons are, they are placed right where your fingers go to press the iron together, changing the temperature while ironing...etc. Then, I had trouble getting the plates to meet.  They just wouldn't close all the way.  I would have to use a large section of hair and then it was to large to be effective.", "This is an ultra sleek product from Remington. Works like a a charm in a little amount of time. It heats up fast and its smaller size makes it very easy to carry during travel. Loved the bonus CD which had many useful tips. Thanks Remington.", "I tried this product and I was not happy with the turnout. I have a more expensive iron that does the job and this one did not compare to it. My hair didn't feel silky and additionally the problem that I have with this product is the location of the control buttons. They're located on the outside and as I held the iron, many times my fingers would accidentally change the settings. The old saying is true, you get what you pay for.", "\"This flat iron is worlds better than the other Remington one I've tried recently (Remington S9950  Shine Therapy Straightener, 1\"\").  It's much lighter, and the plates don't move/squeeze so it's easier for me to hold and use.  On the negative side my hand automatically goes to the area of the on/off button which is annoying, but I've found that you need to press and HOLD the button to turn the iron off so it doesn't actually turn off even if you accidentally depress the button while you're using it.The cord is a \"\"swivel\"\" cord meaning that you can twist the iron in circles and the cord doesn't tangle; it stays in one place.  It also has the adjustable temperature setting with the plus and minus buttons.Other features are: automatic shut-off after one hour in case you forget to turn it off and the closing lock function for compact storage (which does NOT work on my iron, but it's not something I really need).This iron came with a DVD called Sleek & Curl which demonstrates how to create five different looks step by step with this product.You can't go wrong with this one.  Very effective and reasonably priced.\"", "This straightener is lightweight and gets very hot. I love the auto shut-off as I sometimes leave the house and worry about whether I shut everything off. This flat iron works great for making curls because of it's size and weight. Nice for the price!", "I'm not sure if I received a defective unit or what, but the Remington Studio Sleek & Curl 1-inch flat iron didn't perform well for me.  I used this on my daughters long hair, which is very easy to straighten, and the results were disappointing.First, the unit wouldn't turn on.  I manipulated the button using the stick from a lollipop, and it finally turned on.  The units light is supposed to pulse until the temperature is stable, but it never stopped pulsing, in 20 minutes time.  The unit did appear to be heated, but it's hard to be sure at what temperature.I do like the long cord and its swivel, and the appliance is easy to handle overall.  However, the results were unacceptable.  My daughters hair did appear to be straightened and shiny immediately after use, but within a few minutes, the hair lost most of the shine.  By the time she got on the school bus, her hair looked almost as if it had never been flat-ironed.If you are in the market for a fairly inexpensive comparable flat-iron, I recommend spending just a few dollars more and purchasing the TRESemme Philips Thermal Creations Straightener.  We have excellent results with this unit.Again, perhaps my unit is faulty but it just didn't perform as expected.", "I had my sister try it out and give me feedback on the product. Here's what she had to say. It is fast heating, light, long cord and it has a nice design. She is more familiar with other hair straighteners and has used them, so I am giving this a 4.5 star based on what she told me.", "wow, these new hair straightners are made to be used with ease and my hair is not tugged or snagged as I am using it.  This one is great with smooth plates that does not tugg your hair, but the grip is fantastic without too much effort. This even works for short hair (had a major cut over the weekend). Easy to handle and light to hold.there is a temperature gauge that starts at 300 and you can increase it to 420.  I found that 300 level was more than adequate.  there is a switch to lock the temperature so you dont accidently increase/ decrease the temperature as you are using it.  it heats up very quickly and cools down just as fast.I am throwing away my old one and this one is a keeper. it works and for the price it is very affordable.", "When I try out a new straightener or dryer, I test with hair shampooed and conditioned. No special hair products.The results with this straightener was no surprise to me. Nothing special.Heat up at 390 degrees took about 3 minutes. A bit too long, in my opinion.It has swivel cord. That's a plus.The handles on the outside of the plate got real hot. It's not possible to handle it there. This isn't uncommon amongst the straighteners, though. The placements of the buttons made me push them by accident very often. There are button lock options, though.On the other hand, there are no temperature lock features. It didn't seem like a problem when I straighten, though.I don't like that it's only ceramic coated, rather than real solid ceramic plates. I don't know anything about Titanium, but I don't trust metals, personally.The iron caught my hair a few times and broke a couple.My hair still feels frizzy and dry, not silky.If you really care about the health of your hair, I'd buy those with solid ceramic plates. If you only do this once in a while and you don't care, or it's for a teen who doesn't care, then I'd consider this at less than $30.It is a pretty unit, though.", "What a difference from the old irons that were bulky had buttons/controls that were placed in the wrong area,and were a general pain in the butt to use. This unit is well made and handles nicely.Works on long and short hair, curly or straight. The temperature gauge is nice, I found I did not need the highest setting of 420 degrees. It is reasonably priced. You will not be tugging to get your hair out of it. My daughter has very long hair and she really liked how this unit performed ( she is trying to  convince me to  let her have it!!). It is nice to see that Remington is still one of the leaders  in personal applainces. It appears they have been busy  trying to design products that not only work but are  easy to use and reasonably priced. You won't be disappointed."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0469706729054451, 0.042578067630529404, 0.03954319655895233, 0.04763995110988617, 0.030423160642385483, 0.04492717608809471, 0.04436688870191574, 0.04722290113568306, 0.04653026908636093, 0.04719195142388344, 0.045550715178251266, 0.049558378756046295, 0.04947960376739502, 0.04929853603243828, 0.05154351890087128, 0.032911185175180435, 0.04959065839648247, 0.047598887234926224, 0.04948220029473305, 0.05071578174829483, 0.044125739485025406, 0.042750559747219086]]}
