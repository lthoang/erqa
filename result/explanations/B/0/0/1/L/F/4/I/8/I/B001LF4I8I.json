You have to remember to press the button firmly and not just once as we started out doing. :) My 12 year old was able to use it by herself and it heated up very fast and left her hair straight and shiny.  She loves the blue color and so do I. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat. We usually go to the hairdresser and get our hair ironed out but this will definitely save us some money in the future as we can do this at home without worrying about damaging our hair. Not sure how the avocado oil works but it does.", "This iron is easy to use right out of the box, has variable temperate, that only took a few minutes to figure out, and is infused with avocado oil as well, which I'm sure helps the shine! It also only takes a few minutes to heat up, so if you're in a hurry, the iron heats up in about 1-2 minutes.Does NOT burn scalp while working close to it, which is better than other irons I've tried.With this iron, it is surprisingly easy to use to straighten AND style (curl hair, flip ends, etc.), and one can change style easily in minutes, even with long hair!If your New Year's resolution is to take better care, to look better, loose weight, etc., this tool makes a great edition to one's toolbox of beauty tools! I wish I'd had this before my son's wedding, as my hair does tend to fly away and get the frizzies. This takes that out of the equation, and unlike using a ton of moose, that makes one's hair stiffer, this product makes one's hair easily manageable, AND you can add extra style, and if you don't like it, you can change it back in seconds! I can also get it right next to my scalp without getting burned! Also great for damaged/overly dry (And probably processed hair) hair as the low temp setting is made just for those of us who have thin hair that gets bleached by the sun easily!VERY kewl product! Also comes with 3 year warranty! Hair irons have come a LONG way over the years! This one is well worth the investment, and works as well as much more expensive irons I've tried!", "I got this straightener for my wife. Here's what she had to say about it:Overall, this straightener is just OK. I mean, it does the job...my hair is straight now, but not without some struggle. I have very fine, basically straight hair, but I have a short haircut that tends to get frizzy if I don't use the straightener.Pros: It's small (only 1 inch), so you can get pretty close to the root. Also, it has an auto off feature, which is huge for me as I've definitely left the house with my straighteners plugged in. The last pro is that it has a locking feature so it's easier to store.Cons: The temperature control is on the front of the straightener. I kept hitting it with my thumb and changing the temperature while using it. I also felt like it left my hair unbelievably hot to the touch, to the point where I burned my hand when touching my hair (and this was on the lowest setting). Now I know this is a hot iron, but all the straighteners I've used in the past never actually burned me. You also have to clamp the straightener down really hard as just closing it around your hair doesn't quite do the trick. And with using this extra pressure caused my hair to get extremely static-y, where I had to use static guard just to tame it. I read other reviews where people noted a smell coming off the straightener, but I didn't notice any smell.Overall, I'm happier with my old hunk-a-junk straightener that I've had for 5 years. It's bigger, doesn't burn my hair and gets the job done much quicker with less stress.", "\"I have thick and coarse hair, so I have always spent well over $150 for top of the line flat irons. I am comparing this iron to brand names such as FHI, Sedu and Chi. I can honestly say this flat iron is amazing for such a low price. Besides the pretty baby blue color, it heats up quickly, reaches a high temperature of 430 degrees, nice long flexible cord and a locking handle feature is great for closing the iron shut and storing.I did not notice any residue or unusual/foul odor from the avocado oil or conditioning formula. With continued use I will be able to tell if it does help protect against damage and breakage. I did definitely notice a difference in shine after one use.It does have a locking feature for the temperature (press and hold \"\"-\"\" button) but it does easily become unlocked since you press the same button to unlock it. This is not my first flat iron with LCD display and I have had the same issues with that one as well. Movement of my hands and fingers always unlocks the set temperature.I give it four stars since the plates do not close/touch tightly and the square plate edges. All of my flat irons have rounded edges so it hair glides off without making any indentations.The Remington S9950 Shine Therapy Straightener carries a four year limited warranty.

A easy 5 stars!", "This is a good priced hair straightener and certainly meets our needs.  It works great as a hair curler to make flips in shorter layer cuts as well.  My daughter has fine hair and it creates a flip in no time.It only takes seconds to heat which is very important when getting ready in the mornings.  It's light blue color is pretty and looks nice with our bathroom countertops!We've had no problems with it and I highly recommend this as a decent iron at a low price.I really meant to give this 4 Stars=  I Really Like ItI accidentally clicked 3 stars...Amazon won't allow me to change it. :(", "Having four women (a wife and three daughters) in the house, we also own several own curling/straightening irons.  We own a couple of low end Conair products, a more upscale Wahl and this Remington Shine.  I would rate the Shine far above the Conair entry-level products and a step above the Wahl. Wahl had taken the approach of including components which snap onto the heating plates to infuse conditioners into your hair.  Remington has taken this a step further.  Unlike having to replace conditioning plates ever few weeks,  the Shine's permanent plates are infused with Vitamin E and Avocado oil.  When heating, these conditioners transfer from the plate surface to your hair.  The advertised life of the plates is 4 years, which also matches the product warranty.  Naturally, personal use (how often you use it, how hot a temperature you set, and so on) will affect how long the plates remain infused.  There's no reason to assume that even after the plates are no longer infused,  you couldn't continue to use the straightener.Performance-wise, the Shine is great.  It heats very quickly, leaves hair straight and nicely conditioned, and there is no odor noticeable from the heated plates.  I found that the Wahl tended to over-condition hair a little, but the Remington Shine leaves hair just right.  I'm using the product on long hair, one natural brunette, two natural blondes, and one bottled blonde.  They all love the Shine.What's in the box?

Hinge lock to keep straightener almost completely closed (keepslittle or big hands from getting  badly burned).I didn't find the product to have any `cons'.  This is a really good straightener, and your hair looks nice and straight and perfectly conditioned after use.  Even though there are higher priced straighteners out there,  I would consider this a professional grade product and it is very reasonable priced.", "Pros:1. Great design2. Comfortable to use3.

Doesn't feel solidNot a bad deal if money is an issue.  In comparison to the HAI (Hair Art and Information) flat iron, the performance and quality are lacking.  My hair is thick and slightly coarse and this product did not perform as well as the HAI flat iron.  It didn't work so well on my hair, but perhaps different hair types would have better results.", "I like this flat iron and it ranks among some of the best that I have tried. First off it is actually a really pretty-looking product - made of a semi transparent plastic that looks like a blue-green glass.Functionally, this straightener heats up in about 30 seconds or less. It is lightweight and fits comfortably in the hand. The plates are smooth and feel good on the hair. It never catches any hairs. It makes my hair super straight and it feels smooth and actually picks up a little shine!I usually do a light straighten, but I tested it and if you continue working, your hair will truly get stick straight. You can turn the temperature up really high on this but depending on your hair type I dont think anything higher than the default temperature is necessary. Its a nice product.", "\"I almost wish I hadn't read the reviews before trying out this straightner.  Maybe then I wouldn't have been so disappointed, especially when I saw that someone else preferred it over my favoriteHealthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\"\". I opened up theRemington S9950  Shine Therapy Straightener, 1\"\"this weekend when I knew that I would have at least an hour to spend trying it out.  If you take a look at my profile picture you can see I have mid-back length, medium thickness, naturally curly hair. It is not easy to straighten, but it is fun to do every once in a while so having a quality straightener is important.Before turning the iron on I read through the instructions and got an idea of what temperature setting I should use along with some tips. I set the unit at 370*F, locked it in and waited for it to heat up.I then started piece by piece on my hair, but unfortunately less than one third the way through I had to stop and here's why: With my hair thickness and curl, a straightener needs to clamp down tightly for me to be able to get a smooth result. This straightener doesn't close tightly without you holding the ends together because of the floating plates. Now this wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that the outside of the unit gets nearly as hot as the inside. Fifteen minutes in and my fingers were red, scorched and burning - so I gave up!  I ended up plugging in myHealthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\"\"and finishing the job. (There I have posted before and after pictures on my review of it)Now onto the good. Just because it didn't work for me didn't mean I was giving up, so I lent it to my daughter to try out and she loved it! Her hair is much finer with just waves, no curls and doesn't require so much pressure.  Previously she was using thisAndis 67690 1-Inch Nano-Silver Tourmaline Wet or Dry Ceramic Flat Ironand although she was happy, she says the Remmington is so much better for her hair.  It kept it straight even over night and that really surprised her.So my recommendation would be that although this might not be great for those of us with thick curly hair, based on my daughters review and that of many others it probably works just fine on other types of hair. I can say that I like the look of the Remington Straightener, very feminine. I also wish I could give it more stars, but because the unit gets so hot on the outside I really do feel this is a huge flaw and potentially a recipe for disaster.\"", "\"The Remington 1\"\" Conditioning Flat Iron is a digital model that has a 30-second heat-up that temperature ranges from 300 to 430 degrees. The digital display flashes until it reaches the correct temperature then beeps. It has floating ceramic plates that are infused with conditioners and avocado oil to protect, add shine and moisturize your hair. The conditioners leave no oily residue and are guaranteed to last the lifetime of the iron. The iron comes with a four-year warranty.I don't know how the technology of the infused oils work but it does seem to leave hair shiner and in better condition than flat-irons without the oils. The floating plates are nice and the iron does not pull or tug at your hair.It's a small, sleek looking model that is a very attractive ice blue color.The buttons are under your hand during use but do not get pressed while you straighten your hair so that it isn't turned off or adjusted accidentally.I really like the Remington, it is easy to use and worked on my coarse, thick, wavy hair. My only complaint is the hinge lock is hard to turn. It's a small knob that is hard to turn and I've messed my nail up every time I've tried to lock the hinge.Pros:Light, Compact, Sleek, AttractiveFloating Ceramic PlatesInfused ConditionersDigital Controls and Display Easy to Operate and SeeCons:Hinge Lock Hard to UseNo Storage BagOverall, I recommend the Remington, it's a light, attractive product that straightened my hair and did not damage even the delicate ends.\"", "I'm still learning to use a flat iron so I'm no expert on all of the pros and cons of different brands.Like many of the other reviewers, I already have a quality iron that does what it's designed to do.This product heats quickly and has built-in features that would appeal to many users.Personally, I could have lived without the conditioning feature and still been pleased with the product.As others have mentioned, the placement of the controls can be awkward.Does what it's designed to do and in my opinion, does a good job.", "This product works fine to straighten hair.  I like the narrow plates so it is easier to use and less clumsy than a wider plate straightener.  I was able to flip up or under the ends of my hair, similar to using a curing iron.  This product heats up very quickly.  It also does not take up much room for storage.I do not like the position of the buttons, as they are located right where one holds the iron (holding the iron any closer to the plates would result in burned fingers).  Thus straightener gets very hot, making me wonder how much damage is occuring to my hair.  I could not tell if the avocado oil/conditioners do anything.  The knob to lock the plates together is difficult to turn, especially if you don't want to break a fingernail.Overall a decent product and probably a pretty good value compared to the high buck salon brands.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars.", "\"This past year I've tried over a half dozen different hair straighteners and have found this to be one of the better straighteners.I've most recently been using the 1\"\" TRESemme Philips HP4669/05 Thermal Creations Straightener and love it's no frills performance.  The Remington S9950 Shine Therapy straightener is giving it a run for it's money and may be my new go-to straightener.The Remington features an appealing 50's inspired retro blue and silver hue that immediately brightens my mornings.Quick heat up time and easy to tell when the temperature is right. I love that this straightener has a default heat setting in the middle. It is defaulted at 390-degrees, which is the high-end temperature for medium textured hair.  This allows the user to only have to dial up or down a few degrees, rather than starting at the lowest temperature and taking forever to get to the proper setting.  I also want to point out that this does not dial up by 1-degree incraments.  It dials up by larger incraments.There is a blue toned light that glows from the temperature display window. When the iron is heating up, the light blinks. When the temperature is ready, the light turns solid and an slight audio beep is heard. This is a wonderful feature that allows for me to run around and do other things while my iron is heating up. It's also nice that I don't have to goto the iron to see that it's ready. I can tell from across the room.The dials are on the main part of the handle.  I normally hate when this happens because I will either turn my iron off or change the temperature of it during use. This has not happened with this iron. The buttons are made so that the displays can't be changed with just a light touch.  I read in the instructions something about a lock but have yet to figure out how to activate it. I don't think it's necessary though-at least for my fingers.  I would recommend holding the iron over the buttons as opposed to over the plates because the outside does get hot.  I'd rather risk changing the setting than risk getting a burn because it can easily be done if this iron is held near the top.The plates are 1-inch and includes conditioner in the plates that help give hair a shine boost.  I'm not normally a fan of multi-purpose irons. This one, is not bad because the plates do not need replaced or any type of maintenance. The conditioner is supposed to last for the lifetime of the iron.  As far as the shine factor goes, I did notice that my hair is shiny. Nothing drastic but it is shinier.The plates are also \"\"floating\"\". This simply means that there is a layer of material between the plate and the housing that has a cushion effect.  Almost like shocks. This allows for some up and down movement of the plates and eliminates hair pulling.  This is a great feature on this iron.  It made it easy for me to flip my hair under with a turn of the wrist. I was also able to flip my hair out easily as well.I've read a review that mentioned the small plate causing creases or crimps. I have not experienced this with the Remington. The floating plates allows for a quick run through from root to tip. If the iron is in motion and does not stop, there will be no creases caused by smaller plates. I would actually recommend going through the hair quickly with this iron to avoid overheating the hair.  The iron works well enough that one or two quick swipes work better than one slow one that can overheat the hair and damage it.There is a swivel cord as well that gives the user more freedom to work on awkward areas without getting tied up. The cord hasn't been in my way yet and is the right length where it is not too short and not too long.I did notice a slight odor when using this iron but I can't determine if it is from the conditioning plates or just the smell from using a new gadget that has plates on it.  Either way, it DOES NOT smell like burning hair or anything offensive.There is a lock on the arm of the iron. My lock is tight and hard for me to open and close. Hopefully this will loosen up with time.Overall this is an excellent iron. It does require changing straightening technique (going faster through the hair) but the performance is strong enough that this will add time to the straightening procedure and may just protect hair.I would recommend this as one of the better, low priced straighteners.UPDATE: If used two days in a row without washing hair in between, there is a build up on the hair. It looks dull and dirty when it does not with my normal iron.  Another reason why I don't like my products to be multi-functional. I just want it to do one thing right!!  Still good for a quick straighten but I will not be retiring my Phillips anytime soon.\"", "\"Now, I'm pretty critical when it concerns hair-straighteners. I look for two essential aspects in any potential purchase: comfort and protection. Since I need a high-end styler for home and a \"\"good\"\" one for travel, I have definitely experimented with a few brands and models. In fact, this is the FOURTH one I have ordered from Amazon:1.) I LOVE myT3 Ceramic Flat Iron. Though there is nothing \"\"fancy\"\" about it, it is amazing at achieving pin-straight hair with little damage!2.) I discovered that theInfiniti by Conair Professional Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Stylerwas painful heavy/bulky. I had to set it down after three minutes because the semi-straight hair wasn't worth the discomfort.3.) I thought the design of theHealthy Infusions Wahl Pro Straightenerwas horrendous. Strands of hair became caught in the seams and was painful pulled out.4.) This brings me to the Remington Shine Therapy. I can happily say that I have finally found my perfect travel-straightener!!While the \"\"cute-factor\"\" grabs one's attention (powder-blue with silver accents), this is a genuinely effective product. It heats quickly!! (No more pacing between the bathroom and the bedroom chanting \"\"Is it hot yet?\"\"). Moreover, the heat seems evenly distributed (i.e. the results are uniform). The lengthy, swivel cord  is a welcome luxury since I tend to straighten like a maniac (twisting and turning in all directions to ensure that the back is as tidy as the front). And, it is lightweight (thank you!). No more aching arms!Now, I do agree that my hair felt \"\"too hot\"\" after I passed it through the iron. I am a little worried that this straightener may be doing more damage than my tourmaline (at-home) one. So, my only suggestion (and this goes for all heated appliances, really) is not to over-use it. (Which is easier said than done with these kind of results!) Likewise, the \"\"shine therapy\"\" is nice, BUT I feel this product is such a fine value for the price that it really doesn't need a gimmick. So, just consider it a little bonus.I have to admit, the Remington straightener met (and even exceeded) my high expectations! Give it a try!!\"", "I think this is a pretty good product.  Here's my problem: I'm completely new to flat irons.  This is my first one.  The instruction page tells only the basics of how to work it, and nothing about styling ideas or even the benefits of the flat iron.  So you'll need to go elsewhere to learn how to go beyond turning it on and dragging it through your hair -- somebody like me needs to know how to use it to style my hair.But it's working fine. It's just not very novice-friendly and seems to be made for people who have a lot of experience using flat irons already, so I'm looking up wikis and such and learning by experience.  I can see how it has the potential to vastly expand my styling options, especially now with a shorter new haircut.", "Here is the woman of the houses review:This is the best of the name brand irons out there.Heats Fast!Stays Hot!Works Great!Silky smooth and just awesome hair that looks like I went to the shop to have it done.I highly recommend this device!", "\"This straightening iron is great... perfect contour to hold.  I use this to straighten my daughters hair and it doesn't get too hot for her and it works the first time around.  I don't have to go over it again and again.  The features that standout for me are:  it heats quickly and is lightweight!  The swivel cord was another plus as well.  The only thing I can say that was a \"\"con\"\" was that it had a weird smell to it.  Nothing horrible just something weird.  My daughter first noticed it and made a comment.  Don't think I would have made an issue out of it but she did.\"", "\"I have below shoulder length, coarse, curly hair and usually use a 2\"\" Curlmaster ceramic iron to straighten it. My first impression of this iron was that is seemed rather lightweight and the plates seemed smaller than I was used to. However, I was pleasantly surprised.The iron heats up very quickly, with a digital display which adjusts the heat in 10 degree increments. I like to have a fairly hot iron and 370 seemed to work well. I like this feature. The only downside is the placement of the buttons on the handle meant that I accidentally pressed them several times while straightening my hair. Fortunately the unit beeps when the heat is changed, so I was able to adjust it.The other difference from my other iron is the rubber cushioning under the plates. At first it seemed like I was not pressing hard enough, or that there was space between the plates, and I was skeptical about this feature. I am used to pressing fairly hard with my old iron. However, despite not having to use a lot of pressure, my hair was straightened easily. This made the process go a lot faster because I could more quickly move the iron down my hair and did not has as many \"\"bumps\"\" or crimps that I would have to go over again.Over all I am very pleased with this product. I really am not so sure about the \"\"shine therapy\"\" feature as I use a shine/silicone product beforehand and did not notice a dramatic difference there. The shine product on the plates, however, may account for the smoothness of the plates. I am curious to see how this holds up.I would really recommend this product for someone with fairly curly hair like mine. Extremely curly/African American hair...I am not so sure because I am still convinced pressure is the best way to straighten that type. Nonetheless it may work on shorter hair of that type.Still, I really like it!\"", "\"I think this is over-priced, but I've never spent more than $30 on a straightening iron.I do love using it, though.  My hair is straight and fine and needs styling every day, or it looks like I have bedhead.  Many years ago, I struggled with curling irons, winding up with dents and bends in my hair, and of course, product buildup.  What a pain.  I'd think, \"\"I'm sure I could do a better job if I could just slide my hair through, instead of wrapping it around.\"\"  And yes, I did try that with curling irons, and yes, my hair did get all stuck and tangled up.  Well, you curly-haired people were holding out on me!  I finally discovered straightening irons, and now I can actually style my hair.I've owned several before, and liked them all, but this has the smoothest plates, hands down.  My hair just glides though so easily.  It makes short work of simple grooming and I can even do little flips and twizzles for the first time in my life.  Yes, I do love it.But I'm dinging it a star for two reasons.  It has an automatic shutoff, but it doesn't shut off for an hour.  That is not an effective safety feature.  A fire could start much sooner than that.Also, the claim of conditioners and avocado oil are ridiculous.  If they're really there, they'd burn off the first time you use it.  It really is smooth to use and will smooth your hair, but that claim is bogus.So use it and enjoy, unless you're prone to forget to turn off your personal care appliances.\"", "I bought my wife the basic CHI 1 hair straightener for her birthday, and then a week later was fortunate enough to be asked by Amazon to review Remington's hair straightener.  My wife loved the CHI...it was SO much better than the $20 unit she had been using.  She then tried the Remington after using the CHI for about 2 weeks, and she likes the Remington even better.She likes that she can set the temperature.  She has thick hair so it helps her get done faster.  She likes the finish the Remington leaves, which is a little bit silkier and softer than the CHI.  She also likes the light blue color of the Remington, and the fact that it is a little bit lighter in weight.  Did I mention that it is $16 cheaper than the CHI 1 too?I like the fact that when you buy a Remington from Amazon, it doesn't void the warranty...which is what happens when you buy a CHI from anywhere but a salon.  Shame on Farouk for hosing the public this way.Looks like my wife's CHI 1 will be going on fleaBay shortly.", "\"I don't know why manufacturers keep wanting to add conditioners to flat irons when you can buy a separate product and apply as much or as little of it as you want or need on any given day to protect and/or soften your hair.  I'm finding that when conditioner is added to the iron itself people either seem not to notice any difference or, as was the case for me with this iron, that it makes hair go really limp.  And as others have noted, the smell of the conditioner is pretty nasty.The positives of this iron are fast heat up time (yes, it really does heat up in 30 seconds), easy to use controls, light weight and what seems to be an accurate thermostat.  The plates come out really close to the edge of the iron, which means the overall size is easily manageable. The display is easy to read, and the power button and plus and minus controls are conveniently located.  There is even a turbo function that allows you to increase the heat to maximum at the press of a button and you can hold one of the keys to lock in the temperature so that you don't accidentally change the setting.  The 1\"\" size is great for straightening large sections of hair at once, while still being small enough to work around the ears.  You can lock the iron into the closed position, which makes it possible to store it easily without having to wrap it up with the cord.  Finally, the price of this iron is lower than a lot of comparable products.My 3/4\"\" ceramic flat iron is a godsend in that I have really fine, frizzy hair that blow drying never gets very straight or smooth and that goes haywire with the tiniest amount of humidity or just from sleeping on it.  I was looking to add a 1\"\" model to my tool drawer so that I'd have a back-up in case mine broke, plus a larger sized one for times when I want really flat hair.If it weren't for the conditioner, this flat iron would suit my needs to a tee and I'd use it regularly.  Instead, I'm relegating it to back-up status and only using it otherwise on super humid days when I'm willing to wash, dry and iron my hair all over again the next day to get the excess conditioner out.  The Shine Therapy concept seems to be nothing more than a marketing gimmick that this otherwise excellent product doesn't need and would be better off without.\"", "\"I prefer a smaller plate on my straightener, like the 1\"\" Remington S9950 model.  The smaller plate gives you the ability to flip the ends up. It works great for normal to thin hair.  Thick curly hair, might want a larger plate simply to save time.I also found this product delivered on it's shine therapy promise.  Since it is \"\"infused\"\" with avocado, oils, among other things, I wonder how long the shine therapy portion of the straightener can last?\"", "I was very impressed with the Remington S9950 Shine Therapy Straightener.I own two FHI'S and love them. This flat iron gives the two I own a run for their money. It straightened my hair beautifully and it's shiny and soft as it can be.It's also a cool light blue color, which doesn't affect it's performance, of course, but looks nice on the counter. :)It also has a limited 4-year warranty which is a definite plus. And it works as well as the more expensive flat irons. Also the conditioners and the Avocado oil last lifetime of the straightener.The reason for the four (4.5) stars instead of 5 is because I'm not crazy about the controls being so close to where I hold the iron, but I have not accidentally hit a wrong button, so it has not been a problem for me.It heats up very quickly - in about two minutes or so. The max heat is 430 degree F.  I never noticed any smell at all, which I was glad about because I'm very sensitive to smells.I love this flat iron and the price is great, too! And I love the way my hair looks and feels.", "I like using straightening irons but honestly half the time when I'm getting ready to leave the in the morning my hair is still semi-wet, in order for it to work properly the hair must be dry so that's the only obstacle that I can think of when using straightening irons. When my hair is dry, I like to use it when mood strikes but the results are worth even the small effort. I love the sleek and edgy look it gives to my locks, and its funny how most people notice a difference, I definitely get compliments on my hair when I use it.This iron is really great, especially for the price. It heats up fast and is pretty powerful, sometimes I run it through the hair a few times, front to back and for no more than 45 seconds total, it really doesn't take long to make the hair sleek and shiny. I think the avocado strip is a nice idea, it smells funny but it makes the hair glossier and it stays sleek for a long time. I haven't notice any damage yet but then again I don't do this every day, more like a few times a month. Great buy for something that makes a difference and can add a certain glamour to hair, and I always feel little prettier when I use it.", "I've got a wide variety of straightening irons at this point, and the Remington Shine Therapy is a nice addition.It's a smallish, compact straightener, the perfect size for travel when you don't want to cart around a ton of heavy hair implements. It heats up quickly; the temperature control is well tuned and has a nice locking feature. The plates zip through the hair effortlessly and do a fine job of straightening.The downside? It takes a few more passes on average to get a good straightening effect (comparing this to other straighteners in the same price range.) The avocado oil, with which this is supposedly imbued to give hair a high gloss, has an odd odor when the thing heats up. Not enough to discourage me from using it, but you might buy this and wonder what that odd smell is!My hair responded really well to the Remington; it really gave my thick, wavy hair a nice shine and a feel akin to a salon straightening visit.I'd highly recommend it for travel use for the size and function, although it works well for a reliable daily straightener. Granted, it might be a little pricey for a travel purchase, but something cheaper might not work, and if it doesn't, the money is a total waste.The bucks you'd spend on this straightener are a good investment, and then, once you arrive at your destination, you won't have to worry that your hair appliances are going to fail you!", "I just used this new iron on clean and dry shoulder length fine hair. I used the lowest setting and that worked great. My hair had some static electricity issues and it all got smoothed out. My hair is soft and has much more shine!I straightened it and then flipped the ends with a  quick turn and that also worked great. The rotating cord is a huge plus. Also the floating ceramic plates are great. My last iron stopped coming together flat after about a month. I returned it to the company and got a new one only to have it happen again so I am glad to have this new one that looks like a winner.I have one con that may be just due to the fact I have long fingers but as I use it how I hold it I kept hitting the increase and decrease temperature buttons and need to kept re-adjusting. Over time I should learn to hold it in another fashion. This may or may not be an issue for you but wanted to get everything out on the table so to speak.My hair feels soft and not burnt in any way. It looks and feels great.It is an nice soft blue/aqua color that looks nice in the bathroom, not the ususal brown or black.The 4 year warranty makes it a great value. I highly recommend the product. It is a bit smaller than some other irons which I think makes it much easier to use and store.", "My wife love the supposed effects of a flat iron but has had little luck with the ones she has tried.  Her main complaint was that the iron tended to dry out her hair.Happy to say she's delighted with this Remington iron.  The infusion of avocado oil leaves her hair shiny and soft with the effect she wanted from a flat iron.  It heats in a jif, and the temperature control is on-spot accurate.When she's happy, I'm happy!", "\"I like this straightner.  I have been using a chi but I put that one away and I'm lovin this one.  It gets HOT! goes to 430 degrees. I do have to mention that it does not have a temperature lock and where the buttons are placed it easy to change the temp while using it.  It heats up fast and beeps when it reaches the requested temperature.  That's also how you know you've bumped the buttons and changed the temp because it will beep as it adjusts and reaches the new \"\"requested\"\" temp.\"", "This is a very efficient product from rRemington. Works like a charm, takes less time compared to my older version from Remington. Also true to its name, there is more shine. Recommended.", "This iron has an interesting feature, according to Remington it has a vitamin conditioning and avocado oil technology built in. Also, it actually has three different heat settings for three different types of hair which is something that some of the other irons including more expensive ones don't have. Having said that, I gave it four stars instead of five because of the location of the settings. Several times while I was styling my hair, I would accidentally press on a heat setting thus changing the temperature. I feel that the buttons are just too close to where you hold the iron. Another extra feature of this iron is that it has a lock mode which is great for traveling or for storing it in small spaces when it's not in usage. As far as the final outcome, it made my hair look and feel silky. Overall, this is a good product for its price."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03235628828406334, 0.025760604068636894, 0.03710629791021347, 0.02522081695497036, 0.030489837750792503, 0.03626103326678276, 0.03408835455775261, 0.027077345177531242, 0.03293167054653168, 0.029267992824316025, 0.021208586171269417, 0.032254960387945175, 0.03674831986427307, 0.03291076421737671, 0.02971768006682396, 0.018510473892092705, 0.03198835626244545, 0.03465142101049423, 0.03599812090396881, 0.03315265104174614, 0.02644401229918003, 0.03530039265751839, 0.03079456090927124, 0.0306533295661211, 0.03214796259999275, 0.031937696039676666, 0.03004816174507141, 0.03204795718193054, 0.033477265387773514, 0.029960092157125473, 0.03398238867521286, 0.03550466150045395]]}
