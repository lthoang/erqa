"], "reviews": ["Having already tried the Orange Tangerine, I thought I knew what to expect on this one.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the difference.  I'm not sure if it is just the orange vs watermelon & strawberry, but it was much better all the way around. I didn't find the carbonation to be excessive and the flavor was surprisingly good.  However, it still has too much sugar and too many calories to be considered healthy in my opinion.  I also felt like this flavor had a more natural taste, not an artificial one.  If you want to give Switch a try, start out with this flavor first!", "\"The label says it's Watermelon and Strawberry but I did not taste either one of these flavors.  I did taste adulterated grape and apple and something \"\"musty like\"\".  There wasn't really any carbonation either. With the lack of a great flavor and at 140 Calories for this tiny little can of 8.3 ounces with 36 grams of carbs and 35 grams of sugar (albeit natural fruit sugars), I'd rather have a glass of water.  It's wonderful that they do not use any added sugars or corn syrup or preservatives but the flavor and calorie count of this drink just does not justify consuming it.  Then you have to consider the high cost to buy it.....  . NO....I will not be buying this drink EVER again!  The concept of it is marvelous but the follow through...not good!!\"", "Simply said, this is a delicious and healthy drink which is a great substitute for sugar-filled colas in your diet.  Yes it contains fruit sugars but at least they are close to thier natural state.", "\"I was unimpressed with SWITCH WATERMELON/STRAWBERRY. It's just another entry into the sparkling juice market--a market that really didn't need another brand, especially not one lacking in anything new or interesting.Like all the other sparkling juice drinks, its flavor comes mostly from apple and grape juice concentrates; the flavors on the label are only a small part of the ingredients list. The result is that this doesn't really taste like watermelon OR strawberry.  Instead, it fits some food scientist's \"\"flavor profile\"\" of those two tastes, kind of watermelon-ish, kind of strawberry-ish, but lacking in both. The flavor is just not anything to shout about, and no better than the other products on the market.I'm also not sure why it's called SWITCH. I guess it's a marketing thing--they want people to \"\"switch\"\" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. Well, I know that *I* won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink.\"", "Great alternative to sodas lunch...Has a great watermelon flavor with a strawberry after kick.Better for you than Vitamin water drinks a well.", "This is the most awesome drink ever.  I love bubbly drinks, but do not drink sodas due to the unhealthiness of them.  I sometimes drink bubbly water as a treat.  This drink is perfect.  It is bubbly, but not unhealthy.  It is 100% fruit juice.  It is not sticky, but has just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess.And the flavor is delectabale.  It is the perfect blend of fruit juices.  I love fresh watermelons, but when it comes to watermelon flavor, I don't like it to be very strong.  That's why I love this drink - there is only a hint of watermelon flavor.  The strawberry flavor is a little stronger.  But all together, the flavors are a perfect blend.  It can't get any better than this.", "Although I could really distinguish the taste of the watermelon or stawberry. I thought the flavor was pleasant and refreshing.The added carbonation makes it even more enjoyable.Being a much healthier alternative to very sugary and artificially flavored drinks, I am pleased by the ingredients and overall flavor.I was very pleased with this beverage and recommend it highly.", "The Switch line of beverages feature fruit juice that has been mixed with sparkling water to give a refreshing flavor.  This one has a mild watermelon flavor with strawberry overtones.  One of the great aspects of Switch is there is no added sugar.  This means that their juices are not overwhelmingly sweet, but instead are thirst-quenching with great fruit flavors.", "\"Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansen's soda. I tried two flavors: this strawberry watermelon, and the orange tangerine . I preferred the orange one. This didn't really taste \"\"watermelon strawberry\"\" to me. There's a LOT of juices mixed in, a made the flavor \"\"muddy.\"\" I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter (and, I think, more carbonated). But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!\"", "I have tried most flavors of Switch and I think Watermelon Strawberry is hands down my most favorite.When you first sip it, the flavor of fresh watermelon (not candy sweet watermelon) is crisp yet light and enhanced by the carbonation, this is quickly followed by a strawberry flavor that can best be described as identical to the strawberry juice at the bottom of the bowl.  Even though this doesn't have added table sugar, the strawberry sweetness (enhanced by other fruit juices) does taste like strawberries with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on them- so the juice at the bottom is sweet but not syrupy thick and sweet...Delicious and carb wise I would use this as a tasty alternative to regular sodas.  Good stuff.", "Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.Prior to trying this, I enjoyed thekiwi berryflavor. I thought it would have paired well with a pastry, so this time around I tried the watermelon strawberry whilst snacking on a strawberry Pop Tart. You might think that's too much berry at one time, but they go well together. What I'm not thrilled about is that by itself the drink tastes like Jolly Rancher candy in liquid form. It's a bit tart. But the can is cool - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.", "This soda is lightly sweet with a touch of tartness. It comes in an 8.3 ounce can which is just about the right amount for me. It has a hint of strawberry flavor, with apple flavor predominating, and less of watermelon. It reminded me somewhat of Myers sparkling soda but with a lighter flavor.As a point of reference my favorite soda is Sprecher's root beer for its mellow, creamy taste, plus it uses honey and cane sugar instead of corn syrup. My least favorite soda is Coca-Cola because of its overly sweet taste, corn syrup, and caffeine.I would definitely try this soda again.", "Man, how could they go wrong?! Just lightly carbonate some naturally sweet fruit juices, package it, and wait for people like us to lap it up. Actually I might pursue litigation if I thought I had the original thought on this, as I've pondered the idea often, but I'm sure that would have to be a class action lawsuit and I don't exactly have the resources or business experience to commit to it, but I guess that's just my way of saying it's a great idea. Yum!", "This 'all natural' soda comes in the tasy fruit combo flavor of watermelon & strawberry.  the small 8.3 oz can packs a 140 calorie wallop - and is very pricey considering what is paid for a case (and the cans being only 8.3 oz).It has a nice taste, but lacks the 'wow' factor of some of the other gourmet sodas.", "Our family is addicted toIzze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btlsduring the summers so we gave these a try, mostly because of the additional flavors.  Unfortunately rather than the refreshing, more understated tastes of Izzies, this soda has a more syrupy Jolly Rancher flavor.  My seven year-old gives this 5 stars, but it is a little too much for an adult palette.We still appreciate a soda replacement with no added sugar or preservatives.  It saves a little on the guilt.  We also tried Switch's Kiwi Berry which was not as sickeningly sweet for adults and still a hit with kids, but we will be getting Izzies for treats on a hot summer day.", "\"Of the three \"\"Switch\"\" juices I have tried (The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)andThe Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)), this is my favorite. It is not as sweet as the other two, and it has more of a rather unique flavor of its own. It's not like eating strawberries or watermelon, and the blend of the two, with the carbonation, give it a slightly different, less predictable taste, which is a plus if you are tired of \"\"more of the same\"\" flavors..The 8.3oz can (one serving) has 140 calories, but at least it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, which is certainly a big plus over the traditional Colas, sodas and sugar-loaded iced teas.\"", "Basically, this is carbonated fruit juice, no added sugars.  I was concerned that it might be a bit too sweet for me, so I poured it over some ice and found that the resulting beverage was just right once the ice had melted a little.  The first taste I noticed was the sweet juiciness of the watermelon, followed by the tang of strawberry as the drink went down.  The carbonation gave everything an overall sprightliness that I really enjoyed.  Sadly, my enjoyment was short-lived, because this watermelon/strawberry drink went down all too fast.  Each can has only 8.3 ounces of tongue-tingling deliciousness, leaving me wanting more.  Sigh.", "\"Watermelon and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink \"\"hits the spot\"\".  It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it has a whopping 35g of sugar.  The main fruit juices, are grape and apple.  As a \"\"snack\"\" or \"\"treat,\"\" it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an \"\"energy\"\" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine.I also made a review of the kiwi and strawberry which tastes slightly better and has 2g less of sugar.  The real reason I gave this product one star less than the other is that Amazon needs to work on their packaging/handling.  See my customer photo.  This item was just plain filthy with some kind of dirty/greasy industrial soot on it.  I had to REALLY scrub it with dishwashing detergent.  After that, it was good! (But, I shouldn't have had to scrub it.)\"", "Wow,this is the second Switch drink that I have tried and the flavor was great.  I could taste the watermelon with a hint of strawberry. The carbonation is so light that it does not seem like a carbonated drink at all. I am very happy that there is no added sugar or preservatives in my drinks.I normally do not drink carbonated beverages, but this is more like a sparkling fruit drink as opposed to carbonated like a Pepsi or Coke product.I enjoyed this flavor very much and look forward to trying other flavors in the Switch products.", "This is a tasty drink that is all natural.  However, a small 8.3 ounce can contains a relatively high 140 calories which is roughly the same number of calories in a 12 ounce Coke.  Only, a Coke is about 50% larger in volume.I like sweet, but to me this is a bit too sweet.  It might be nice as a mixer in an adult beverage though.  I haven't tried to mix it, but you could probably make a nice fruity alcoholic drink out of it.The price isn't a bargain.  At nearly $1 per can, as of this writing, it wouldn't seem to be a compelling value.  I do like it, but I doubt I'd purchase it again.  It also left a bit of a lingering metallic aftertaste that I wasn't thrilled about.  Still, if you don't mind the calories, enjoy a beverage that is sweet and are looking for a natural drink, then this could be worth considering.", "\"Picked this item on amazon. Sounded really good because I like fruit juice. It is marketed as a way to SWITCH from regular soda to fruit juice. Like others have said, it's too sweet, sweet, sweet and does not have a \"\"natural\"\" watermelon/strawberry flavor.Your kids might like it if you're trying to get them off the phoney stuff (coke, squirt, etc.), but......you're better off with making your own juice and adding a bit of seltzer water....oh, now that's yummy!!! I'd recommend staying away from this product and perhaps drinking the best available: H2O\"", "Loved this drink. The sweetness level was just right, and I really liked the fact this is 100% juice without corn syrup or refined sugar. I didn't really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry, but it was a really nice, pleasant flavor. The carbonation was just right. I also liked that this drink didn't leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks. This had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing.", "Switch is a good carbonated beverage that is as advertised.  Many times you get carbonated beverage products that claim to have a particular flavor, in this case watermelon, and the drink tastes nothing like what is claimed.  In this case, the beverage tastes just like watermelon.Other than the authentic flavor, I did not find this drink overly sweet compared to other non-diet carbonated beverages and it has natural flavors.  It does have 140 calories, and while it says no sugar added, sugar is on the nutrition label, which I normally don't read anyway.  If you are health conscious, unlike me, I'd check out the label and ingredients to make sure it's for you.To me, overall this is a pretty good, if not great, carbonated beverage, but not one I would go out of my way to purchase.", "I tried the black cherry switch and was not impressed. I thought I would give it one more try and give this flavor a chance. It's better, but still not something I can get excited about. The watermelon strawberry flavor is faint enough to where it is almost overpowered by the carbonation. If you want the taste of a fruit drink with the healthiness of fruit juice, this may be a good option for you. It was an unimpressive option for me.", "This drink isn't too bad. It's a little bit to far on the tart side for me, (but with a little splash of spiced rum, only for those old enough of course, ;) makes it a lot better.Over all, I like it & if it was available around here and didn't cost too much I'd buy it.", "This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great. So far this is my favorite flavor from the line of switch.", "Yikes. It might not have high fructose corn syrup, but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Really, really sticky sweet, and no discernible fizz on the tongue. You can see a few languid bubbles when you pour it in the glass, but it's nothing you notice in the drinking.  It's at least twice as sweet as Kool-aid and every bit as fizzy. You could cut it with about 2/3 soda water and it might bring the sugar down and the fizz up to an appropriate level for adult consumption. Now that I think of it, I wish I had tried that--it's more a flavored syrup than an actual beverage.", "This juice drink is a bit sweet, but it's all juice, so added sweeteners (or those awful artificial sweeteners!).  The taste is refreshing, cool, and....well....fun!  I can see enjoying this on a sunny patio in the summer.  The slight carbonation adds a nice zing.  I really like this drink.", "\"Switch is a great replacement for regular soda.  The Watermelon/Strawberry version of Switch has a nice flavor, just the right amount of carbonation, and is naturally sweet, so there's no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup.The only criticism I can offer is that this drink tastes more like a combination of Apple and Grape juice than it does Watermelon and Strawberry.  If it was called \"\"Switch Apple & Grape\"\", I would have given it 5 stars, but since it is called \"\"Watermelon and Strawberry\"\", and doesn't particularly taste like either one of those, I'm going to dock 1 star.Nonetheless, I think the beverage tastes good and would serve it to friends.\"", "This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.In this case Flavored with Strawberries and Watermelon.I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.I really found it tasty yet not overpowering in it's flavor as some of the other flavors.", "I sampled both this Watermelon Strawberry and the Black Cherry flavors. I was very curious as to how this flavor would taste, because I love watermelon but don't usually like watermelon-favored drinks.I was quite pleased.  It was very sweet and light, not heavy or syrupy.  The taste was not overwhelming but was just right.  As advertised, it's carbonated which makes it go great with a meal.  Like the other flavor I tried, there was no aftertaste, since this is real sugar.My only disappointment with the product is the tiny can (8.3 oz). I'm not a fan of those, and even at Amazon's low prices these drinks are very expensive.For the healthy conscious, this is something you should look into.  There is real sugar, and no caffeine, no artificial stuff.  The ingredients are simple.  But don't think you're going to lose weight on this stuff.  There's 130 calories per tiny can, which is just a little bit fewer than the same serving size of Mountain Dew.  But since this is 100% juice, it's probably a little healthier.", "\"Disclaimer: I am a VINE REVIEWER and therefore I received one item of this product for free to review.I have a marketing background and the marketing here is great, \"\"The Switch\"\" is an ideal name and with consumers looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, this is a good \"\"switch\"\" ;-)This is a tasty beverage made from juice concentrates with no added sugars. To quench that thirst and you want the feel of carbonation (you know what I mean!) man, this is a good choice.My only gripe might be that it is tiny, just a cup or ~8oz. It goes by quick. I have no idea on pricing, again since I'm a VINE reviewer, but it's going to need to be comparable to the price of regular sodas or cheaper, else why make the 'switch' ? I do wish it came in 12, 16 or 20 oz variants.The Watermelon Strawberry flavor is great.  Think of a Welch's Grape Soda, but in a healthier form with no processed sugar.  (Natural sugars from fruit is okay, processed sugars are bad) Essentially this is a good tasting soda that is not a soda and it still has carbonation, but it still natural juice. :-)\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.029293060302734375, 0.029970116913318634, 0.03187008574604988, 0.030754312872886658, 0.033825162798166275, 0.032503385096788406, 0.03380066901445389, 0.03294946253299713, 0.03628342226147652, 0.02736380323767662, 0.027217280119657516, 0.03248913586139679, 0.0319366380572319, 0.032348502427339554, 0.030825551599264145, 0.018345266580581665, 0.029986955225467682, 0.031306441873311996, 0.03141883388161659, 0.030244290828704834, 0.030492180958390236, 0.02762896940112114, 0.03439686819911003, 0.04080729931592941, 0.030168626457452774, 0.034202247858047485, 0.03267037495970726, 0.029484273865818977, 0.031719814985990524, 0.03326522931456566, 0.03228015452623367, 0.028151540085673332]]}
