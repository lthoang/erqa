It's not a Canon hv20... but I got an open-box Vado HD from Amazon for $160 and it's more than good enough for $160. The sound quality is... functional. It's mono and pretty rough sounding. If having high-quality sound is important, you might consider getting a stereo portable recorder anyway. But it works.The video quality is as good as can be expected for the price. It looks pretty good, but since it's pretty compressed, it doesn't stand up well to extreme color grading.However, there is a lot to like about this camera:1. Wide-angle lens - the Vado has the widest lens of all the cheap pocket HD cameras, which leaves everything in more or less in focus.2. Wide-angle lens - since all of the pocket cameras lack image stabilization, the wider lens causes moves and shakes to appear less noticeable than on the other pocket cams (especially the Mino).3. Interface - it features a very simple and intuitive interface.4. Feel - it's tiny, light, and the rubbery mat finish feels good, seems reasonably tough and doesn't show fingerprints.5. Features - 8GB of built in memory and replaceable rechargeable battery. Having the option of inserting a spare battery is nice.These are not dealbreakers, but here are the things that are not awesome about the Vado HD:1. Annoying on/off chime - there is no way to disable the ringtone that chimes when you turn the unit on or off. I'm assuming this is to discourage upskirt cam people or something, but I think it's kind of obnoxious for the rest of us who might like to shoot in a quiet place without disturbing others.2. USB thingy - the USB plug is located on the bottom of the unit off to the side, which makes it impossible to prop the unit up against something without holding it. It's not everyday that I'd want to do that, but I just don't see why they couldn't have made the bottom level.3. weird AVI codec - a lot of programs have difficulty reading the format that the Vado HD records. It's an AVI with a fairly non-standard codec. I would definitely prefer that it recorded to Quicktime files, as they seem to play better with more software suites. Final Cut will import them, but than makes you render for playback in the timeline. As a workaround, I batch convert all of the .avi files to Apple Intermediate Codec files for working within Final Cut, so that I don't have to render every time I make an edit. It's not a huge deal, but it's not really ideal either. Premier on the Mac won't even import the files... and this is after downloading the special .avi codec. I'm not sure if it's possible to get the files working on Premier on the Mac without converting them via Quicktime first.UPDATE: I have since begun editing on Premiere on the PC, and it works great. I have also finally watched the videos on my 32\"\" LCD and the picture looks pretty amazing - way better than you would expect from something that costs under $200 and fits in your pocket.Okay, that was longer than I meant for it to be.In summary, it's a pretty amazing little camera. Don't expect the same video quality as a $500 HD camcorder and you won't be disappointed. But for less than $200, it rules. Even if you have a fancy camera, you might end up using this more, because you really can easily fit it in your pocket. It's smaller and lighter than most current cell phones.\"", "I got mine about a week ago.... darn, I paid $31 more! But I must say I was really surprised at the quality of the videos and the stills I capture with my ACDSee software. It's also very nicely made, not cheap. It's so small and light that it adds no weight at all to my hand bag. I did get the extra battery and stand alone charger for nearly $50 more. The battery is about the same size as my mobile phone battery. It comes with a USB extension cord for use with a desktop computer, and a clear rubbery sleeve/case. It's really nice. At this price, I'd buy them for gifts.* You do have to hold the camera as steady as possible, but the quality of the video is still good, even if a little jumpy while walking around and recording. I was concerned about the lack of stabilizer when I ordered the camera, but the video is a lot better than I expected. And, as I mentioned, the stills I capture are good size 2.6mb files, decent enough quality for a 5x7 print.* I never installed the software that came with the camera. I have so many graphic software packages already on my computer, and because this camera captures in a compatible format and the files are in AVI format, all my current software is able to view and edit the video files.* I find the camera easy to hold, especially with the sleeve that it comes with. The very first time I touched the control buttons, they did move faster than I expected, but not so that it took any time to get use to.", "\"The best thing about these mini camcorders are that they're easy to use. My ten year old started making her own \"\"TV show\"\" seconds after I handed her the Vado. This camcorder is really small, like half a deck of cards so it's easy to carry around and pull out in an instant. So whether you want to catch your friend's goofy stunt or your baby's first words it makes it really easy. And then just like that you pull out the USB cord and upload the video directly to youtube (by the way you can set privacy options so only your family or selected friends see the video). Or put it there for the world to see and instant fame (or shame, depending on the video!)Here's what I like about this camcorder, I will also compare with Flip MinoHD wherever applicable:-- Takes HD video (720p) in 16:9 ratio, picture is very sharp especially when viewed on a computer screen or your HDTV. It even comes with an HDMI cable which allows you to see super sharp videos.-- 2 inch LCD screen (let me say it again, TWO inches!) it's a HUGE plus over MinoHD. It is so much easier to see what you're shooting rather than squinting into the MinoHD. And playback is fun too, most times people want to see the video the minute you're done shooting and this really allows you to show it off.-- Video time is 2 hours (8GB) in HD, longer in lower res. The video quality is excellent with really natural colors, I am pretty impressed how nice the videos look compared to the earlier Flip cameras and to me it looks even better than MinoHD.-- Rechargeable battery that you can take out and replace easily (unlike MinoHD) so you can even have a backup-- You can buy a wall charger (wall plug with USB slot) and hook this camcorder to an outlet if you don't have your laptop handy for charging. I just use the one that came with iPhone/iPod-- Silicon skin to protect your camcorder comes in the box, however, I don't like it and just bought a slim case instead which also protects the lens.-- To upload your video you just pull out the USB 2.0 cord and plug it into your computer like a mini external drive. You can then directly upload your video to youtube, myspace or any other video-sharing website without having to transfer it to your computer. Or just upload it to your computer.-- Super sleek and easy to carry in your front pocket or jeans. It is really slim and pretty rugged especially with the silicone skin. It's very light, so even drops don't seem to damage it.-- Controls are super-easy, really child's play-- Good performance in low light - although one wishes for some sort of extra light source in a really dark room, this camcorder performs above average in low light as does the Mino HD-- Sound is pretty good especially given the size. The sound syncs well with the picture too. The videos I shoot with my digital camera sometimes go out of sync but not with the Vado.-- Easily charged through your computer, has a Li-ion battery-- Creates MP4 video with good compression so the files are not huge like the one from your digital camera, it makes loading files into youtube or your computer fast and easy.-- Software drivers are on the camcorder drive and it works with Windows XP and Vista (32 and 64 bit) and even Mac. In case of any problems the Vado site has additional drivers available.--The camcorder works perfectly with Mac and QuickTime for viewing your videos as well as Windows Media Player or any other popular player.--Comes with HDMI Cable that you can directly hook up to your HDTV (a big plus!)Here's what I don't like:-- Zoom is limited at 2X digital zoom. It's great for making videos of people right in front of you but if you're trying to record a performance from a distance prepare to be disappointed (same as MinoHD)-- Given basic controls it's also difficult to zoom in very smoothly but I find it slightly easier than with MinoHD. Vado is best for mostly fixed focus videos, the zoom is pretty limited anyway.This camcorder was selling for lesser than MinoHD in the beginning but then went up in price as favorable product raves started coming in. You can't expect this camcorder to replace your high end Sony digi-camcorder but it's the best choice for those fun, spur of the moment videos that even your kids can shoot with ease. And it holds up well in rainy conditions too.\"", "I have dealt with several different handy cams. I am always looking for the top performers and this camera is the best I've used so far for the price. I was very impressed with this camera's ability to record in low light. This is a HUGE thing to take into consideration when thinking about purchasing a handy cam because most take terrible footage indoors. I own also a aiptek camera, which suffers horribly in low light. Image quality on this is good but not amazing, the aiptek has better image quality with sufficient lighting. I do not own a mac, which means that the .mov videos that other camera's use are worthless to me because I don't want to pay for an expensive conversion software in order to convert it to a usable format without losing image quality. With this I can edit the .avi videos from the creative vado in windows movie maker! The only big drawback for me on this camera is the fact that I can't see the screen if I'm in it, the screen is on the back of the camera so if I'm on the other side I don't know exactly what's in the frame and whats not. This is somewhat compensated by this camera's incredible wide-angle lens which allows for you to be closer to what you're recording, another important thing when comparing handy-cams. The aiptek was horrible at this, I had to be about 7 feet from the camera in order to be in the video. Like I said, the only downside to this camera is video quality is good but not the highest I've seen and you can't see what you're recording if you are on the other side of the camera. I would definitely recommend this camera as it is low cost yet takes great footage. Not a big deal if it gets broken, lost or stolen. I use it to make videos for facebook and youtube and they look great.", "\"I received my Creative Labs Vado 720p Pocket Video Camcorder a couple of weeks ago.  I love it.  Whats not to like?  Its tiny, extremely easy to use, and takes great videos which are also extremely easy to watch on my computer or my TV.I have used other mini camcorders, and they work great, but I like the Vados ability to take great videos indoors.  On some of the others I have tried, you need to be way across the room in order to get an entire person in the video.  With this Vado I can stand a few feet away and shoot a few people from head to toe.  Thats a great feature for me because I have kids and I like to have a camcorder around to catch some memories as they happen.  And many of them happen indoors, at close range.The Vado comes with a USB extender cable, which is great so I don't have to hang the camcorder off the front of my PC.  Included is a silicone jacket that slips over the camcorder to protect it from scratches, and it also makes it easier to grip so there is no chance of it slipping out of your fingers.  It also has an HDMI cable so I can hook it to my TV and watch videos directly from the camcorder.  The kids love that feature because every time I film them they want me to play it on the TV.  And it is very easy to do.This camcorder is perfect for me.  It takes great videos, its small and light weight, and its easy to watch and edit the videos.  I am not a huge \"\"gadget\"\" type of person.  I like things simple and easy, and I like to get great results.  The Vado fits that bill perfectly.The thinking process for me is why spend thousands of dollars getting a model with all the bells and whistles when this camcorder will handle 99% of all my video needs?  Its a great camcorder and I highly recommend it.\"", "I have both the Vado HD and the Flip HD.  I had thought that I lost the Flip, which I loved, but I purchased the Vado because it had features the Flip did not have at the time(Mini HDMI, removable battery and 2x Zoom) also it was a good deal cheaper.  Soon after I purchased the Vado I found my Flip HD-so now I have both.  The Flip is very Mac Friendly, the Vado is quite the opposite.  The Flip's built in software helps you import and organize your video files and is quicktime compatible.  The Vado does not come with Mac compatible software so you are left to drag and drop the video files to your computers drive.  Worst of all the Vado Files are in AVI format.  This format is difficult to play and edit on a Mac.  Final Cut does not accept the file format and neither does IMovie.  That leaves the Vado camera to playback footage on your HD TV or if you use a third party software translator such as VLC you can watch the footage on your computer.  Maybe Windows users can be happy with this camera, but as a Mac user I would advise not purchasing the Vado HD.", "\"The Vado HD camcorder is a nice new entry into the \"\"mini camcorder\"\" market and I was looking forward to seeing how it compared to my Flip Mino (non-HD) camera. I didn't really need the HD capability, but I thought it would be icing on the cake. However, I really haven't had the chance to do an overall comparison of the two cameras because I am still having problems getting the Vado to work on my Mac.I'm not even 100% convinced that the Vado is totally Mac-compatible. The Vado website says it is, with some limitations. (Specifically: \"\"1. Users can install Perian 1.1.2 from [...] to view Vado HD videos. 2. Mac functionality limited to importing files from Vado/Vado HD and using them with QuickTime player and suitable video codecs. Vado Central software is not compatible with Mac OS.\"\") Some Amazon reviewers say the camera works with their Mac. Some say that it doesn't. I do know that the actual system requirements listed on the Amazon product page do not make any reference to Mac systems, so maybe I'm just out of luck. In any case, I still haven't figured out how to play back my videos successfully, despite reading other reviewers' suggestions, downloading the QuickTime plug-in suggested by Vado and other reviewers, and contacting Vado's customer service people.All that being said, taking video with the Vado was a pleasant enough experience. The controls are easy to use and intuitive, although I still like the controls on the Flip camera better. I like the camera cover that was included with the Vado. That's a nice extra, but I can't figure out why they didn't make it black to match the camera. Also, the lack of an included A/V cable is just silly. That's like selling a car without tires.If I was a PC user, my 3-star review might very well be a glowing 5-star review because I do see a lot of rave reviews of this product from PC users. But I'm a Mac user and have to give the Vado an \"\"average\"\" score of 3 stars simply because I can't get it to play videos on my Mac. To be fair, the Vado's video does play back nicely on my television. (I hooked up the Vado to my TV using the A/V cable that came with my Flip camera...Oh, the irony!) But if I can't play the video on my Mac, this camera doesn't do me a whole lot of good.The bottom line is that I'm very happy with my non-HDFlip Video Mino Series Camcorder, 60 Minutes (Black)and like it better than the HD Vado. It works like a charm and plays nicely with my Mac. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the HD Vado. (Note: Even the Flip Mino HD version is cheaper than the HD Vado.) For what these camcorders do, I personally am not sure the HD feature is worth it. It's more money, the video files take up more space, take longer to upload, require a faster computer processor, etc. If all you want one of these camcorders for is to take video of spontaneous moments and upload them to your computer or YouTube, I think most people would be happy with a non-HD model. For HD video, maybe buying a \"\"real\"\" camcorder makes more sense.\"", "LOVE THE 720p HD quality video! The sound is tinny - but if you dont have a lot of money to invest in one that has better sound, its a good deal. I can not speak for the 2nd and 3rd generations of the Creative Labs VADO HD camcorders but this older model is handy. Just slip it in your shirt pocket or keep it under your car seat to capture those odd moments when you wish you just had the Video of some cool action or scene going on near you. Even if you have a better Pocket Camcorder this is handy to keep with you all the time. Just dont expect the sound quality to be great. Its good enough as long as sound quality is not what you are looking for.Has an included video editor software built inside which I have not used yet. I use my Corel VideoStudio Pro X3 video editor HOWEVER for some reason that particular video editor will not take the Vado generated AVI videos. I have to convert them to WMV files using a freeware (FREEMAKE VIDEO CONVERTER) with no noticible image quality loss.If you need a HD Camcorder for on the fly spur of the moment use - grab it. Takes great indoor shots with lamp light or available sunlight filtering into the house. Gotta love that aspect of this model.", "I've tried theFlip MinoHD Camcorder, 60 Minutes (Black)and I can certainly recommend the Vado HD over it.  Still, just like the Flip, I'm left wondering what is so great about a $200 dedicated video camera that isn't any smaller than my $200Panasonic DMC-FX37K 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)which has comparable video capabilities along with a host of still camera features.  The Panasonic is even smaller.  So, these products don't make much sense to me.However, if you must have one, the Vado is certainly cool, very easy to use, durable, and has a larger screen than the Flip.", "I recently got one of these and I must say that I LOVE IT!!!  The video quality is phenomenal and combine that with its incredible portability it makes for my ultimate video experience.  I am able to carry it around in my pocket and film my kids or whatever is going on at any time I want to.  Then to have the fact that it is completely digital makes for easy storage and editing on your computer.I recommend this for anyone that is on the go and would like to make sure they catch all those family, friend or work memories and activities.I work in Marketing and have found this a great tool to film different seminars we host and put them on our website for later viewing.", "Creative Labs Vado HD 720 Pocket Video Camcorder brings back many of the same features of the original Vado with a couple of modifications. Instead of a recessed lens the newer version extends out from the body. With a slight weight increase over the older model it is also a tad thicker. The microphone is now shifted to the other side of the lens. Creative Labs includes a protective muted white colored silicone skin to cover the black bodied Vado HD 720.One of the Vado's key features is a mini HDMI connector for outputting 1080i video to HDTV along with a standard composite AV output. Creative also bundles an HDMI cable. It is not a composite cable. Packed with 8GB of built-in memory it allows for the storage of up to 2 hours HD video. Mimicking a thumb drive, this model offers a flip out USB connector. It captures H.264 encoded videos at 30 frames per second with a 1,280x720 CMOS sensor, and saves them as AVI instead of MPEG-4. 640x480 VGA video is also an option. The threaded tripod mount is a nice addition. The battery is removable and recharges via USB. Battery life is averaging almost 2 hours. A glaring omission is a flash memory slot.Upon connecting to Windows PC, the software automatically pops up and offers the options of playing videos or uploading to YouTube or Photobucket. As with most electronic products, plug-in installation is required. The software is very basic and not loaded with many editing features.Buyers should keep in mind that the Vado HD 720 is not a true HD video camcorder but a POCKET video camcorder. Like its competition, the unit offers a low-resolution sensor with a miniature fixed lens. Given that, while fine tuning exposure is not an option, contrast is surprisingly good. The key is that one will be able to view videos full screen via HDTV or computer monitor. For that purpose alone, the Vado HD 720p gets high marks over the competition.One thing to keep in mind is that the folks at Creative Labs/LogiTech have a poor track record in providing quality customer care. Sadly, product support is hit and miss at best. I strongly recommend backing up this purchase with a good extended warranty. Surprisingly, the gurus at Creative Labs actually thought about the consumer this time and indeed put some effort in this product. The Vado HD720p goes the distance.", "They gave it 4 out of 5 stars, rating of 8/10.The good:Solid 720p video; ultraslim design; removable, rechargeable battery; easy to use; one-touch video uploading to YouTube and Photobucket; includes mini HDMI connector and bundled cable for outputting 1080i video to an HDTV.The bad:No flash-memory slot; Mac users have to manually copy video files to their computers; white balance is slightly off and colors are a little amped.The bottom line:The Creative Vado HD may fall slightly short of the Flip Video Mino HD in terms of video quality, but it's stronger feature set may tempt you.Things are heating up in the mini camcorder space as Kodak, RCA, Flip Video, and now Creative all have HD models. Flip Video leads the market with its popular Mino HD camcorder, but Creative has done some interesting things with its Vado HD to make your choice that much harder.For starters, the Vado HD retains many of the appealing design traits of the original Vado, including an ample 2-inch antiglare LCD (for recording and playback)with some small modifications. The Vado HD comes in black and its lens extends out from the body instead of being slightly recessed. The new model is a hair thicker and weighs slightly more (3.5 ounces vs. 3.3 ounces), and the mic has been shifted to the other side of the lens. More importantly, however, the Vado has something that neither the Kodak Zi6 nor the Flip Video MinoHD has: a mini HDMI connector for outputting 1080i video to your HDTV along with a standard composite AV output. Surprisingly, Creative also bundles an HDMI cable, though not a composite cable. Plus, it comes with 8GB of built-in memory vs. the MinoHD's 4GB. That allows you to store 2 hours worth of HD video.In our review of the Vado, we knocked it a bit for its no-frills implementation, and Creative seems to have taken that to heart. Along with the HDMI cable, the company throws in a protective silicone skin and a more robust software package for tweaking your videos after you shoot them. Like the MinoHD, it captures H.264 encoded videos at 30 frames per second with a 1,280x720 CMOS sensor, but saves them as AVI instead of MPEG-4, and gives you about 2 hours of battery life from its removable rechargeable battery (Creative sells extra batteries in case you want to carry a backup). You can also shoot 640x480 VGA video if you want. It has a threaded tripod mount on the bottom; it helps to use a tripod to keep the camcorder steady and ensure your video isn't too jittery.As we said with the Vado, the rubberized finish has a nice feel to it, but it's worth noting that it'll absorb stains more easily than a camera with a hard, shiny plastic finish. It's good that this model is black because when we accidentally touched the silver Vado with the tip of a pen, it left a small mark that was difficult to completely remove. One other minor gripe: we would have preferred if the silicone skin was completely clear or a dark color. It's kind of milky off white and doesn't look great on the camcorder; the device looks slicker naked. We hope that Creative will offer some additional color choices in the future.Like its mini camcorder brethren, the Vado HD has a flip-out USB connector so you can plug it into your Windows or Mac system as if it were a thumbdrive. The unit recharges through USB. When you plug the camcorder into your Windows PC, the software automatically pops up and offers the options of playing videos, uploading them to YouTube (you need to input your account info the first time) or Photobucket, and after installing a plug-in, creating a movie and stringing together several video clips. All in all, we found the software simple to use and the interface elegant. There's not a ton of features--don't expect a full editing package--but there's enough to help you make a little more out of your videos without having to turn to another software package. One nice touch: it doesn't force you to install the software to simply play the video from the camcorder like the Minos do, which is convenient if you're viewing on a friend's system.While the software is designed for Windows users, Mac users can manually drag and copy their videos from the camcorder to the computer and then upload them to YouTube or import them into iMovie or another editing package. In other words, the camcorder is geared toward Windows users first, but it is compatible with Macs.Overall, we were pretty impressed with the video quality. To be clear, this is not a true HD video camcorder--you can only expect so much from a low-resolution sensor and tiny no-zoom lens--but as with the MinoHD, the key is that you can view videos at full screen size on your computer and they remain relatively sharp. Creative seems to bump up the contrast, saturation, and sharpness so the video makes a better first impression, but it doesn't adjust exposure quite as quickly the Mino HD, the white-balance is slightly off (for example, fluorescent light ends up with a slightly greenish hue), and you'll see more fringing around brightly lit objects. We also noticed the same slight judder as we did with the MinoHD.Low light performance was pretty decent, though we felt the MinoHD had fewer artifacts and performed better. The audio sounds about the same: relatively clean, and as long as the speaker doesn't mumble, the tiny mic does a creditable job of picking up the sound.After seeing the results of shooting with each camcorder--and assessing their feature sets--we have to say that it's pretty much a toss-up between the two similarly priced models. The Creative Vado HD has an edge in features, and maybe design, particularly if you want the larger LCD, while the MinoHD has a slight edge in video quality. It's a tough call.Here's the link for the actual review:[...]Update:PC World has released its review:[...]It just won PC Mag Editors' Choice.[...]", "\"This is my third pocket camcorder. My first was an RCA EZ201 Small Wonder 60 Minute model. The price was low and the picture quality was poor, but it was good enough for doing things like taking video of items in my home for insurance purposes, and recording the location of my septic tank on video. After becoming a grandparent, I felt I had a good reason to want a high definition camcorder, and now I own two.One is the Vado HD featured on this page, and the other is the Flip Mino HD. Here is a quick, rough comparison: The Mino has 4GB of video storage, the Vado has 8GB. Both have a 2X digital zoom. The Mino connects to a USB port via an inflexible arm that comes out of the top of the camera. The Vado arm is flexible and it comes out of the bottom of the camera. The Mino's inflexible USB arm makes me nervous that it will break unless I put something under the camera when it is plugged into my laptop. I have no such fear with the flexible USB arm on the Vado. But the placement of the Vado USB arm is inconvenient for use on a full size (as opposed to a mini size) tripod. It gets in the way, unless it is pulled out and pushed aside when the camera is mounted on the tripod.Based on my experience, the Mino is better in low light conditions than the Vado. But I prefer the Vado mainly because it uses a user-replaceable rechargeable lithium battery, whereas the Mino has a built-in rechargeable lithium battery that is not, technically at least, user-replaceable. I own a Palm PDA that has a built-in rechargeable lithium battery that is not designed to be user replaceable. I've owned this PDA for several years and I imagine that if I did what Palm would like users of its PDAs to do, I'd have replaced it by now. But I really have no need to replace it, unless of course I want one that has a fresher battery that doesn't drain faster and faster as time goes on. Given what the Mino HD and the Vado HD cost, I want them to last me for years, even though their manufacturers will of course continue to come out with new, improved models year after year. So for my money, having a pocket camcorder with a user-replaceable rechargeable battery is the way to go. At some point, the Mino's battery is going to begin to behave like my PDA's battery, which is poorly, and there will be no easy or inexpensive way for me to replace the battery, just as there is no easy or cheap way for me to replace the battery for my PDA. But as long as I continue to handle the Vado with care, I'll be able to replace the battery when it needs replacing.Chris Pirillo (at chris dot pirillo dot com) compares the Mino and the Vado and like me he favors the Vado. CNET's executive editor David Carnoy says \"\"too close to call\"\" about the Vado HD vs. the Mino HD. He finds the Vado falling \"\"slightly short\"\" in video quality, but determines that it has a \"\"stronger feature set\"\" than the Mino.If I had to get rid of one, I'd get rid of the Mino and I'd keep the Vado, without a second thought. So if you're in the market for a user-friendly pocket camcorder with high definition video quality and plenty of storage, I recommend the Vado.\"", "Pros:- Small & Light: The Vado HD is SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER & LIGHTER than the Zi6. If you actually want to put your pocket video camera in your pocket the Vado HD is for you.- Great Controls: The controls are VASTLY superior to the Zi6's. Simple, well spaced buttons are always better than a 4-way joystick.- Good Audio: Doesn't pick up nearly as much background noise as the Zi6 (which is a good thing).- Good Video: The Zi6 is essentially unusable in low light conditions. While no video camera in this category is going to blow you away with its low light performance, at least the Vado HD produces smooth, if noisy video, as opposed to the Zi6's choppy video. In well lit situations they are about the same.- Lithium Ion Battery: The battery is smaller, lighter, and more convenient to recharge than the NiMH AA batteries the Zi6 uses.- Large Storage Capacity: 8GB built-in storage provides at least 2hrs of recording.- Wide Angle Lens: The Vado HD's lens is significantly wider angle. For me this is an advantage because I will mostly be shooting things relatively close to me. The wider field of view also makes it easier to reduce camera shake than with the Zi6.- HDMI Connection: The one cable HDMI video connection is insanely better than the 5 cable AV/Component video solution that Kodak used.Cons:- Layout of USB Connector makes using a full size tripod impossibleAnother big advantage of the Vado HD is that while it does make noises when you turn it on and off, these sounds are barely audible and not nearly as loud and annoying as the Zi6's corresponding noises. To sum up I really like the Vado HD and am very happy I switched from the Kodak Zi6.", "I just hate the fact this thing records in .avi - simply ruins the happy recording experience .... because its using the avi as a wrapper rather than mp4 guess what... the PS3 will NOT play the files directly. LAME!Also , imovie will not work , you must recode to mov , to playback in QT you need perian which is fine but again no imovie editing makes it cumbersome.... so if you are not editing then all is well....Here is another trick I tried... I used Toast 10 to convert my vado file to a avchd playable blu ray THEN copied that file back to the ps3 and then it would play natively on the ps3... again these extra steps make this camera weak.... they really need to make it MP4 so it will playback in other devices --- the whole world does not revolve around windows media player.....I'll be waiting for the Sony webbie or Flip HD rev b ...... Oh well , the device itself is super easy to use but the file your left with is hard to deal with for anything else but playback.... I hope the sony webbie will record in straight mp4 or mts (avchd) with total ps3 native playback so you can keep the files on the hd with zero conversion.THINK Creative before you leap! MP4 and rest of the world playability is important !", "It is very cheap. And it is HD. The quality is very good, especially for the price right now on Amazon. The sound quality is ok, people say it is very bad, but it is actually good, but not very good. It is very light and small. The camera feels very nice and comfortable, it has a matte finish. It comes with a USB extension cable. The USB is built in, so you can take it anywhere, video tape anywhere, upload anywhere, and watch anywhere. The playback on the video camera is good, so you can preview something before you watch it on a computer or a tv. It comes with a mini HD to HD wire so you can connect it to an HD screen. And it comes with a case.", "\"I use this device for quick, on the go video.  I especially like the Vado because of its size and form.  It certainly would not qualify as a \"\"home video\"\" device like the expensive video offerings from Canon, Sony, and Samsung, but for quick, short video that is MILES better than a cell phone, this device rocks!Video playback on a flat screen television is clear and crisp.  There aren't many video options to chose from, so you just sit back and watch!  The real fun was giving the camera to my 13 year old daughter and letting her record her typical Saturday.  Priceless!  She thoroughly enjoyed the device and now uses it quite often.The on-screen menus are intuitive and very user friendly.  I like the placement of the buttons on the device, which make it a breeze to use.  The 1.5 inch video screen is very clean and gives good feedback.  Especially when the operator is not showing a steady hand.Connection to Windows is a snap.  Just pop out the USB connector and and connect to your computer.  Drivers are installed... And away we go!Finally, I think my daughter summed it up quite nicely, \"\"Whoa!  This little (device) is cool!\"\"\"", "Let me start off by noting that I own a Flip HD Mino and using that model influenced my opinion.  Let me also note that I own many Creative Labs products.This video recorder needs around 5 hours to charge before it is ready to operate.  The package includes a slim square battery that is easy to install.  The life span is suppose to be much longer then the Flip which works off AAA batteries but harder & more expensive to replace.  Both systems recharge when connected to your PC.The USB connector is located on the bottom of the Vado as a small rubber tab that sticks out.  You need to pull this to get to the USB port connector.  The Flip has a spring activated button that does not wear well over time, but I'm not sure I like this option either.  The rubber USB works just fine for laptops but you will need the extension USB cord for CPUs due to the flexible rubber.  I was worried about forcing when making this connection but it needs to be shoved in order to work properly.  I much prefer the Flip on this issue.The Vado comes with a fold out page of instructions, which is better when compared to their other products, but sorely lacking for the average customer.  The Flip comes with a booklet manual.There are two other attachments included in the package, a HDMI cable for your TV and a thin rubber cover.  This fits like a second skin and saves wear and tear on the actual unit.  I like.  A LOT.  This round goes to the Vado.The Vado outshines the Flip on recording time.  Vado provides up to 2 hours (yea!) versus 1 hour.  This is a great option for kid functions (dance recitals, plays, etc.).  Advantage Vado by a landslide.For me, the software shines for the Vado.  Creative Lab wins this round. Granted, purchasing additional software for Flip can be purchased to overcome any faults but why add to the cost?The image is better in the Vado in my view but they are close.  I think the colors are truer in the Vado and work better in low lights.  There is a review under Flip that provides a side-by-side video comparison.I would adore this video recorder if the USB port was different.  I need it to connect to a CPU as well as a laptop directly.  The battery is debatable - life expectancy or expediency?  Overall, the Flip is much easier to use but the Vado offers compelling airtime, good software and truer colors.  Combine the two and you get a perfect product.", "\"TheCreative Labs Vado HDis a very nice portable video recorder.  This device is greatly improved over the originalCreative Labs Vado, and I would probably say that this device is the best compact HD recording you can buy for the money.  The list price is high, and the poor software and the fact that there is no optical zoom keeps it from being an absolute slam dunk.The biggest shortcoming that the Creative Vado has is shared by most other compact video recorders.  The included software is extremely slow when you have to actually use it to convert or combine videos.  But you can definitely use this device for home movies, video blogs, YouTube or just about anything else.  Just be prepared to use a different video software.Before I got the Creative Vado, I had already spent a good amount of time with theFlip MinoHD Camcorder.  I was happy with that device, but had heard plenty of hype that the Vado HD was going to be \"\"better.\"\"  I was naturally skeptical but the Vado HD has won me over.  This device features a new improved lens that makes even standard definition videos look extremely good.  The improved recording capacity is enough to capture a complete concert.  And despite what the device specs say about having a 2 hour battery life, I have gotten more than 3 and 1/2 hours of continuous recording out of a single battery charge.  Even better is that the stand-by charge lasts for more than a week.  That means that you don't have to worry about recharging it every night if you want to have it by the ready.  It will hold the charge so that when you need it, it's ready to go.PROS:+ Greatly improved lens produces much better quality video than the original Creative Vado; video quality is very good even when set to standard definition+ Internal storage capacity of 8GB can capture 2 hours of HD+ video or 4 hours of standard definition (SD) video - Twice the HD recording time of the MinoHD, which gives you 1 hour+ Li-ion battery holds a great charge while off and lasts longer than listed 2 hour battery life while recording+ Rechargeable battery is easily swapped and replaced, while the MinoHD's internal battery requires factory replacement or warrantee-voiding hacks+ Easy to use controls are simple to learn, and easy to teach to others+ Microphone sensitivity produces good quality audio+ Records high quality HD video in 720p (1280 x 720) displayed in 16:9 widescreen+ 2 inch LCD versus the 1.5 inch LCD of the MinoHD makes it easier to see what you are shooting+ Compact and light-weight so it's easy to transport in your purse or pocket+ Flexible USB 2.0 connector, along with an extender, makes it easy to download videos to any computer or get a quick charge+ Body seems to have improved durability versus the original Vado as well+ Good light sensors are great for recording in low-light or changing light environments (think concerts)+ Includes support for a decent set of formats, with standard H.264 AVI video+ MP4 video compression allows you to keep files small and copy them faster+ Software drivers install automatically; works with Mac OS X, Linux, Windows XP, Vista 32 bit and Vista 64 bit with no problems+ Includes a decent set of accessories (HDMI cable, silicone case), a very nice change from most similar products+ HDMI cable lets you play videos directly to your HDTV+ Silicone cover provides a good comfortable rubberized grip+ Good \"\"low-battery\"\" indicator gives you plenty of time to finish recording before the unit powers downCONS:- Included muvee software is SLOW if you have to edit, combine or render videos using the built-in software only (For example, when you are at a family get-together and you want to leave the video before you go home)- Included software will also limit you to combining 3 clips and try to \"\"up-sell\"\" you to the pro version- List price pits this unit against digital cameras that capture photos and video- Lack of an SD memory card expansion slot limits total recording capacity- Lack of optical zoom due to fixed lens with 2X digital zoom (internal zoom lenses are possible and some cameras like the Nikon S52 have them; Still the digital zoom works well enough that it might fool some people into thinking it's an optical zoom)- Plastic threaded tripod connector not as durable as the metal threaded connector on the MinoHD- The tab for the USB dongle on the bottom does make it harder to stand on its own (it's not always possible to carry a mini tri-pod)- The power button on the side is the only button that isn't intuitive when training others how to use the device (barely sticks out and hard to see with the silicone case on)- There doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the LCD while recording to increase battery life (if somebody has figured out how, please post a comment)OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES:~ Reasonably priced spare batteries that can be charged as a backup for extended recording on the go~ Optional wall charger allows you to plug the USB cable into an outlet~ Optional AV cable allows you to hook up the unit to non-HD TVs and receivers~ Good collection of third-party cases, lanyards, and tri-pods availableSOFTWAREWhile it's easy to copy videos from the device to your computer, as you can tell I really don't like the included software.  While I have plenty of video editing software on some of my computers, I don't have it on all of them.  Furthermore, sometimes when you are capturing a family video you want to quickly edit it to leave it with your family.  I am too busy to be sure that I will remember to edit and send a video that I recorded a week after the fact.  I tried to quickly edit 30 minutes of video to leave for a relative and doing everything took hours.  By the end I wished I had brought my own laptop with me.So if you have to do editing on the go, just try to record as few files as possible and then copy them to the machine rather than doing tons of editing with the software.  Remember this software limits you to combining 3 clips.  Any more than that and they try to sell you the \"\"premium\"\" version.I was able to edit basic videos usingCorel Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus, though I have also usedPinnacle Studio Moviebox UltimateandSony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Packin the past.  I primarily have been recording standard definition with this camera, but once I got the right software codecs loaded Ulead had no trouble with the HD Videos either.  They now haveCorel VideoStudio Pro X2which is a newer version of the software which replaces Ulead.  I had less luck with Microsoft Movie Maker, which worked but seemed equally as slow with large movies or multiple clips.  Apple iMovie seems to handle everything you throw at it if you're a Mac user.Video editing software is a very personal choice.  I tried as best I could to come up with a recommendation, but I think the best strategy is to test out the free trials for the various options and choose the one that seems most intuitive for you.  The short end of the story is that you should be prepared to use some other video-editing software because what is included here is really only useful for copying videos out of the device to your computer.CONCLUSIONI really like this device.  If I had gotten this before the MinoHD, I might not have upgraded to that model.  You could do a lot worse than the Vado HD.  The minor limitations this device faces are pretty standard for portable video recorders.  The improved lens really makes a huge difference, and it's hard not to notice it: it literally sticks out from the profile of the player case.  This unit is highly recommended.  Just plan on downloading a bunch of trial video editing software so that you can pick one that works best for you.Enjoy.\"", "\"I cannot understand the raving reviews about the video quality of this device.  If you have ever seen the opening footage of \"\"The Wonder Years,\"\" that is pretty much what the video looks like....8mm film footage taken in the late sixties/early seventies. At first I thought perhaps I had mistakenly set it on standard video instead of HD, but no...the setting was correct, and the result was horrible. Perhaps it will please those who just want to watch what they shoot on their computer or who want to use it for uploading to You Tube, or those who really put emphasis on the portability of the unit, thus two stars instead of one. But, other than that, stick with a standard HD camcorder.  (I should, in fairness, note that I am viewing the video on a large, 67-inch wide-screen HD television) Another reviewer mentioned not to expect the same quality you get on your \"\"normal\"\" HD camcorder, which could be the understatement of the year.  I did not really expect the same quality when I bought it, but this thing does not even come close.Another sore point is the fact that the included (in the device) video software is pretty useless unless you upgrade to (buy) the full version, which to me reeks of a \"\"bait-and-switch\"\" tactic. I use Corel Ulead VideoStudio 11.5, which does the job.  I refuse to upgrade the included software simply out of principle.Two other things to be aware of: 1) due to its size, even the slightest movement on your part will make it look like an earthquake hit while you were videoing, and 2) in bright sunlight, what you are viewing through the LCD screen will pretty much be a best guess...it is very difficult to see what the image is and if you are wearing sunglasses, forget about it.My main regret is that I waited to long to test this thing out (past the 30 day return), so now I am stuck with it.  Otherwise, I would have sent it back.  Put whatever you would be spending on this unit toward a highly rated HD camcorder.  They come in fairly small sizes these days in their own right, and you will be much more pleased with the result (by far).EDIT: It's been several days since I wrote this review, and since then I have contacted Creative three times to try to get an RMA (their site will not recognize my serial number to authorize a return; others have had this problem as well) and each correspondence has been a nightmare in frustration.  The unit now has a new problem...it refuses to power on.  This issue is resolved if I take the cover off, take out and then replace the battery.  I have had to do this twice in the past two days. Oddly, the first time I did this, the video quality seemed to greatly improve...but it was still not very impressive in my opinion, just better.  Later that day, the video quality was poor again.  Today, same problem. Keep in mind the quality was poor despite adjusting my television resolution to a lower setting and was also poor on two different PC screens.I have been allowed to return the unit for a refund thanks to Amazon's impeccable customer service.  For me, this was not a good experience and I would not recommend this product.Lastly, I must say that I find it bemusing that so many people consider my review \"\"unhelpful\"\" simply because my experience differs from theirs. It makes me wonder if they have ever experienced \"\"real\"\" HD video at all. If so, I don't understand how this camcorder would warrant such praise and five stars. I wish I had read this (my) review before I bought...hopefully it will help someone in their decision making.  Granted, my experience was probably an anomaly, but it was a real one nevertheless.\"", "Great ultra portable video camera.  If you want to see the actual performance of the Vado, just go to Youtube and you will see tons of clips.FEATURES:- 720 HD- Easy one-button operation to shoot and pause- Easy transfer to PC via built-in USB connector- Wide angle.  If you want to include yourself in the movie, there is better chance you won't miss. This is one of Vado's ace against the Flip line.- USB charging- RCA (AV cable not included) connection for older TVs- Instant preview on a 2-inch LCD screen- A tripod mount on the base- 2x digital zoom. (not excited about that, but at least it tries).  FYI, this is the same zoom range for the Flip.- Removable battery (this is a biggie for me.  How many time have I been to an important occasion and found myself with a depleted battery).  Now I can get a spare.  The Vado HD uses a 3.7V, 1050mAh Li-IonCreative Labs Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery for Vado HD Camcorder.I am happy that Creative is not skimping on this product.  Along with the camera, it also includes an HDMI cable, an additional USB extension (the Vado already has a USB connector at the base of the camera), and comes with its own protective silicone shell.  Another cool thing is that after using the the USB connector, it snaps back in its place magnetically.You can charge the battery in two speeds.  Fast charging in 4.5 hours and normal charging in 7 hours.  The common law about charging battery is to avoid express charging as it produces more heat which results in shorter battery life.  Charge normally unless you are in a hurry.  Also, you can only watch and transfer videos while normal charging.  The battery is easy to install just like a nomal cell phone.BUT HOW DO YOU EDIT VADO'S HD CONTENTS? :1) I tried iMovie and chose different formats; h.264, mov, etc.  I made sure I chose 720P.  the result is smaller picture and so degraded.  But I haven't tried the latest iMovie 2009.2) I did Windows Movie Maker - but there is no HD 720P?Wait. Windows Movie Maker on Windows XP can do 720P HD!Just follow these steps:- Search the net for YouTube-MM-HD-PapaJohn.prx.- Download 7KB ''YouTube-MM-HD-PapaJohn.prx'.  You have to scroll down.- Drag the file to Movie Maker's Profile folder. The path is 'c:\\Program Files\\Movie Maker\\Shared\\Profiles'- When you open Movie Maker you will have a new option to save movie.  It may be all the way down, look for Papajohn....  Just make sure your aspect is 16:9.3) I tried Windows Live Movie Maker by Windows 7 - I picked 720P (even 1080P) encoding.  Make sure coose aspect as 16:9.  It turned out fine.4) Right now, Picassa (yes, the free Google picture organizer) gives you the best HD results.  The problem is there is no transition.  The transition only works if you make a slideshow out of still pictures.  The transition for movie clips just fades into black and then go to the next clip.5) Of course I tried Vado's own software, but too handicapped.  And you have to purchase the upgraded version to do anything at least decent.HOW MUCH VIDEO CAN YOU STORE IN THIS?-You have an option to select 3 video resolutions:2 hrs  - for enhanced HD resolution (this is the default)4 hrs  - for nomal HD resolution8 hrs  - for VGA resolution (640 x 480)VADA BUILT-IN EDITOR:- The Vado comes with its own movie editor installer in the camera hard drive.  You are supposed to be able to upload to 3 sites; YouTube, Photobucket and [...].  The problem is, what you can do is very limited unless you buy the 20$ software upgrade from their site.  With the included limited editor, you can only edit 3 clips and can insert only 1 music.  In short, useless.  Now I tried the free Picassa's own movie editor and was able to make a file in HD and upload to Youtube.MAC & IMOVIE?- Vado was instantly recognized by my Macbook (1st generation white plastic with 2G memory, running on Snow Leopard).  iMovie 6 was able to do edit with transitions but I still cannot find a way to export a 720P HD output.  I tried DV, Mov, etc and still producing less res.Made in China.CONS:- Microphone is annoyingly weak.  This is its biggest shortcoming.  If Vado can resolve this issue, this cam is a solid 5-star.- Artifacts are magnified: 1) under low light and 2) Scenes with sharp contrast.TIPS FOR SHOOTING WITH VADO:1) As with other portable HD cameras, one of the main weaknesses of this type of camera is panning (shooting from left to right or side to side).  Avoid panning as possible.  Just do it occasionally, just to spice up the video.2) Steady your hands as best as you can.3) Never shoot a video while walking.", "We're having so much fun with our Vado!  After nearly 6 months, I've videoed everything from our Disneyworld trip to winter snowstorms and now summer lightning shows. Next month it will be in the tank bag of my motorcycle and traveling across the country with us.For users with a steady hand, this camera can give you results that rival bigger vid cameras, at a price and size that keeps you from worrying about taking it into dirty, dusty or damp situations.It's funny, but my favorite thing about the Vado is that it comes from the factory with a silicone skin, this is one accessory that I always purchase for my cameras and phones, and to have one come with the product is the sign of a company that is thinking and willing to try harder.Small enough to take anywhere, with extremely easy two-button operation that even the technologically challenged will handle with ease, big clear HD video, it's a winner!", "The Vado HD, is a pocket sized memory based video recorder. I will be comparing it to the Flip Ultra as a standard. Like the Flip, the Vado HD  has a built-in USB port, which is on a small flexible 'cable'. Apparently this is helpful for people who are plugging the device into a laptop. The controls are also similar but off set to the left, rather than center line. There is an on/off toggle to one side of the device, which is opposite the HDMI plug (a feature lacking in the non HD Flip), directly above this is a plug for headphones. Unlike the Flip, the Vado HD uses a cell phone battery: it seems standard so should be easy to replace. It also has a 2 hour capacity versus the Flip's 1 hour. Included in the case were cables, documentation (which I never read) and a soft silicon case.This is a trivial but important detail for me. I keep all my electronics in silicon cases that I end up buying from a third party vendor. My goal with most small electronics I own is to sell them after I upgrade, so I try to keep everything in the best condition possible. Having Vado include the case eliminates that extra step which can be a pain in the rear. If you try to go and buy one of these cases right off the shelf from Best Buy or some other brick and mortar, they can cost upwards of $15. They are reasonably cheap here on Amazon. I'd rather just have the case included so I can start using the device immediately.Unfortunately the software included with the Vado HD is Windows only, so I was unable to use it. I have uploaded a couple of videos to youtube to see how they turn out. I do miss the relative transparency of video downloading with the Flip, though the results are ultimately the same. One of the limitations seen in the Flip is still found in the Vado HD - the line of sight 'view' screen. Unless you are in direct line of sight there will be a fair amount of guess work involved in recording events. For extended time shoots I would recommend a tripod or some other device for stabilizing the video recorder.What is really surprising about these little HD cameras is how incredibly small they are, and how light. This unit is easily the same size as my cell phone and weighs much less. You're not lugging around some daft heavy piece of equipment to shove in unsuspecting people's faces anymore; there is no need for that. The video quality is just astonishing when you consider everything you had to go through for something similar just five years ago.", "So I bought this little camera when it was on special for 129.99, for the price:performance it is actually great 5 out of 5 stars but I had to take off one star for a few annoying issues.Lets start with why I got this and the good points, I am comparing this to the Panasonic DV camera it is replacing. I didnt want to spend $600 on a full upgrade to a Canon HF100 which I still think is a little overpriced. This camera is smaller than a pack of cards, nice rubberized exterior, great build quality, small but good quality LCD display. Bonus was the included silicon skin, built in 8gb flash, and mini HDMI cable. I upgraded the firmware to the newest version from creative labs web site.The video is an improvement over my DV camera for sure overall, in terms of definition and raw image quality. I was worried about low light shooting but in fact my concerns we undue, the quality was fine, again, better than the DV camera.I was actually surprised how good the overall video was when played directly from the unit via HDMI to a plasma TV.Now the downsides - sound is poor, mono, non directional, picks up person talking holding the camera way louder than the subject 6 ft in front of the camera.The other major issue I had is the lack of any stabilization, on my DV camera I had 12x optical zoom and IS, zoom I can do without but without the IS you have to get used to holding the camera very still, which can be done but you have to put a little more thought in when holding the camera.Finally one other issue for me was the non standard AVI container file which is not playable on a variety of 3rd party units such as the Playstation 3 which is a biggie for me since I stream media all the time over my home network. My DV camera MPG/MP4 files play fine. Also, I have pinnicle 10 which doesn't play/edit this file without upgrading. I don't understand why MP4 wasn't used - universal and easy to edit.Overall though for 129.99 great buy with the above negative points when compared to a single CCD DV camera. Would probably not get for $200 though. I suspect flash camera HD price points will be coming down over the next year or so.I hope this review is useful :)", "I'm probably showing a very shallow side in that I find theFlip Video MinoHD Camcorderfar more attractive and stylish than this camera.  However, the Vado Camcorder has some nicer features and accessories.Everybody is mentioning that the Vado has double the memory for recording- 2 hours versus 1 hour for the MinoHD.  Big Plus there.  Also it has an owner replaceable battery-- another Big Plus.  I also like the extension USB cord that comes in the package.  Considering the number of items I have that I need to plug into the USB hub, I genuinely appreciate this item which allows me to avoid getting on my knees and searching for a slot more than once.  It also comes with a gel skin, which is a good way to protect your investment.The functionality in comparable to the Flip, but the extras are just too good to miss-- unless you are like me and have this weakness for style.  Maybe I can use the Vado on weekdays and only carry the Mino when I want to impress someone.", "\"Hi All.I am comparing this camera to a Flip Mino HD....while it may not be fair, it is the only way I could give an accurate review to this product.Box Includes:Camera, removable battery, mini hdmi to hdmi cable (wow), usb extension cable, rubber/silicon skin, and documentation.So it starts....the battery comes pretty charged and thus it was easy to install and get the unit running.  The first set of options you are presented with are the setup for date, time, country.  Here is where the first issue begins....the buttons (scroll arrows up, down, right, left) are WAY too sensitive and thus you are moving around even if you dont want to.  So I start to set the date...without paying attention....and I quickly notice that the format for the date is dd/mm/yy which is primarily how the eastern part of the world uses the date.  I finally figure out that my mind is lacking without coffee and I get the date and time set....  Lets move on.The camera notifies you that you can hit the play/pause and trash buttons simultaneously to get back to the setup options.  Works perfectly.  In the setup menu you are presented with the following options:Time/DateVideo QualityInstant RecordAnti-FlickerTv SystemLanguageMost of these are self explanatory. The ones with options are as follows:Video Quality: HD+, HD, VGAInstant Record: On / OffAnti-Flicker: 50hz/60hzTV System: NTSC/PALLanguage: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portugese, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bahasa (Indonesia), Turkish, and ArabicThe main screen shows you what mode you are in (record, ready, etc), the available recording time, the mode (hd+, hd, vga), and a battery meter...these are at the top of the lcd screen.  The bottom of the screen shows the date (dd/mm/year) and the current time.When looking at the LCD the mini hdmi port is on the left hand side of the unit and the right hand side has a power button for on and off.  The usb connector is at the bottom....folded into the body with a tab sticking out so you can pull the connector out.  There is also a standard tripod hole.The shooting begins....I tried taking small clips of things inside the home as well as outdoors (although with the weather up here its not worth standing outside more then 4-5 minutes :-) ).  I shot completely in HD+ mode as there are a lot of units this size that do regular vga and hd....  The image quality on the lcd screen was superb...even when outside under the sun I was able to see what I was shooting.  This I like.  My issue still remains that the rocker buttons are way too sensitive and it was driving me nuts for a while until I was able to mentally adjust the pressure I was applying to them.The viewing begins...  I plugged the mini hdmi to hdmi cable from the camera into our 46\"\" Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD Panel.  The playback was indeed 720p/1080i as the unit should do.  It was flawless and the quality of the video stunned me.  I loved it.  It was comprable to the Flip Mino HD.  Of course, I need help with my stability...since I noticed that movement was apparent...but hey this is no image stabilization camera...  HAHA!All that being said, Creative has created a great HD Pocket Camcorder.What I liked:Removable Battery8gb StorageBuild QualityIncluded accessories (cables, silicon skin)What I diskliked (which is why its 4/5):The buttons (right left up down) are way too sensitive for my needs.Computer Connectivity:MAC OS X Leopard:No drivers needed.Showed up as a usb Volume immediately.iPhoto automatically detected camera and came up with import options.Video Played in Quicktime.  Awesome!Was also able to browse to the camera and manually open AVI file.Windows Vista and Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit operating systems tested)Drivers installed automatically.I did not need the Creative software on the device.I was able to browse (windows explorer) to the Vado and open the AVI file in Windows Media Player.  I love this functionality.  I dont like cluttered software on my machine if I dont need it.In case you are wondering...I am a cross platform user and thus I can review gadgets like the Vado and give accurate reviews.  This unit would have earned a 5/5 but I am not quite there on the rocker buttons...I hope that the review above is informative and helps you make the right decision in this category.Quick Note for MAC Users: 01/26/09You will probably need to install Perian to view AVI files on a mac using quicktime.  You can get the software free at [...]\"", "I bought this camera because it had a top rating by a major magazine.  The operation was intuitive, flawless, and very high quality video for this type of camera, comparable in my opinon to a tape non-HD or even better. It is 720p. It did well in managing light as well. One caveat is that it's so small, it's easy to move it a lot while capturing, so without a tripod the video although high quality, can be too jerky.  That's not the fault of the camera, it's inherent in anything this small.  As to ease of use, simplicity, quality, it's a good value and a must-have if you want something small.  Hold it still or put it on a tripod and you'll get good videos.", "\"This camera is fun, easy to use, works with PC or Mac (surprisingly good on multiple Macs!...more about that in a minute), just like the other knowledgeable reviewers wrote, and best of all it makes an XLNT 720P HD image for viewing on 40\"\" and larger HDTV's. There are caveats to using the Vado HD, but they are few, and just simple common sense would tell you these things if it weren't for reviews and manufacturer advertising:1) When shooting, you've GOT to hold your hand steady, and sure, or camera shake will ruin your HD movies and clips. You can use a tripod to minimize shake to the maximum amount, perhaps one of the \"\"mini\"\" tripods that you see here at Amazon.com. RE tripods, I found that even my Joby GorillaPod \"\"SLR ZOOM\"\" heavy-duty portable, flexible tripod fit the Vado HD easily, and contrary to other reviews, the USB port on the bottom did NOT get in the way of it one bit2) This isn't a substitute for a full-sized HD camera, like my Canon HG20 AVCHD camera, but it will suffice for casual, quick takes of virtually anything your creative mind will allow, and up to a 1 hour uninterrupted HD+ quality video in true 720P/1080i HD format, with big depth of field, up to 2 x 1-hour videos of course, utilizing a full battery to the limit3) You've got to watch out, and protect the lens, otherwise it gets to be full of dust and dirt easily, as there's no lens cap with the camera--I carry my DSLR's lens brush and air \"\"poof\"\" when using Vado HD which solves the problem...give the lens a quick brush off a couple times a day during shooting, just to be sure it's clean, and it's ready for action4) Accessories are REALLY hard to get right now, but maybe that will change soon, as the camera's popularity and rave success has the manufacturer/seller (Creative Labs) scrambling for inventory on the extra battery, charger, etc. In fact, I am on the \"\"waiting email list\"\" at Creative Labs right now because I want to get the external charger, and an extra battery, for those days when I'm using Vado HD for more than its 2-hour battery and filming \"\"window\"\" of opportunity-caveat on the battery, the normal Vado battery will NOT fit in the Vado HD and function!! If you want the extra battery, it's got to be from Creative Labs at this time, and they have been out of stock for weeks nowThose things being written, the rest is just cake, candy, and ice cream-easy to write about, and describe. Here's the positive things I've found about Vado HD so far, and I'll come back and add more after I use it more...this list is compiled after just about 1 week's use, and doesn't represent even 25% of what I have in mind for using Vado HD:1) It's just like you imagined it would and should be, using the camera that is--it's easy, fun, and with XLNT ergonomics for being so small, pretty much all-user-intuitive controls which I go into further on in the review2) The camera makes incredible 720P/1080i HD movie/clip footage for viewing onscreen, immediately without editing, by using the supplied Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable--it's easy to use your HDTV as a viewer/editor vs. wasting all your time downloading the video to your PC or Mac, editing it, etc.3) A steady hand/tripod yields an XLNT clip or video movie, up to 60 minutes long it turns out (Windows FAT File System limit of 4GB of data problem), so look out for that window once you get rolling and all will work out great...of course you can make 2(two) 1-hour HD+ quality movies which equals the 2 hour \"\"window\"\" of Vado HD4) To use on a Mac, as I have both PC and Mac here in my studio, it's very simple-have QuickTime Pro (yup, you've gotta upgrade if you want full compatibility with cameras like this, and for other reasons too!) support the movie, use the Export Video command, and a huge array of possibilities is there for the taking--for converting the AVI formatted film from Vado HD into an M4V H.264 QuickTime Video for iPod, iPhone, or other media device from our friends at Apple. Or you can simply import into iMovie/iDVD if you want to go full-boat and edit your footage, add music, etc.My favorite command is just \"\"AppleTV\"\" command, and in a few short minutes of conversion on an Intel Mac with a lot of C2Duo horsepower, or better yet a Quad single or double CPU in a Mac Pro...but hold onto your hats Mac Heads, I even had success using my \"\"dated\"\" Dual Core 2.3Ghz G5, albeit one with a ton of RAM (16GB), making hour-long AppleTV movies, no editing, no hassle, just straight into ATV format and BAM! It's onscreen with great clarity, depth of field, a true HD experience quickly via Vado HD5) On the PC, or Virtual Machine in Parallels or VM Ware Fusion, XP Pro/Vista, whatever...I tried them all and they are equally easy. The video codec automagically imports and installs itself into your Windows Client, be it WMV, Windows Movie Maker, or the Vado HD Client itself, Vado Central Software (a bit limited of course in scope, ease of use, or mechanics...but it WILL work if necessary and you don't have fancy video editing software on PC).Now, to get specific about the controls and functions of the Vado HD, which is important in any review of the camera, let's dive right into it!The USB 2.0 port, which is necessary to transfer video to your computer for whatever purpose you have in mind, is on the bottom of the camera, and there's a pleasant \"\"Click\"\" that it makes when it's open, or closed, so there's no doubt about it being in either position. I LIKE the flexible port/device USB male plug, which extends out and away from the bottom of the camera an inch so. The design is well-thought out, I think, because there are times when you might need a flexible \"\"cable-like\"\" function, and this provides it. As I wrote above, this does NOT compromise the fitting of a tripod!Vado HD will take 2 hours worth of HD+ 720P/1080i movies, the default setting of the camera by the way. Then there's HD-quality, slightly less than HD+, but still good quality film, which equals 4 hours of action. Then there's VGA mode, and in this mode (640x480 pixels) Vado HD will shoot up to  8 hours of movies, and that's a LOT of capacity, where you'd need 4 batteries to fill up the camera! Wow! That's an interesting option when you simply want to film things that are not of great import, and you have a lot of it to do, but you'd need that external charger (that I want to purchase badly and can't right now!), and 3 extra batteries!As to the controls for the camera, let me describe where everything is, and what it does...The 1.5\"\" x 1\"\" LCD display, a mini-display that is amazingly sharp and well defined, has a \"\"Ready\"\" indicator in the top, left, to tell you the camera is set to shoot. When you are shooting video, there's a RED DOT that replaces the \"\"Ready\"\" indicator. To shoot, just press the \"\"logical controller\"\" once, and to stop, press the control once again...dead straight simple!At the right, top of the display is the digital Video Quality Display, which is by default set at HD+, and next to it is a Battery Indicator, which shows the state of relative charge of the battery.In the middle, at the top of the display, is the Recording Time Left indicator, which is in hours, minutes, and seconds, so it's very, very accurate as to what is left in Vado HD's flash memory.The left, bottom edge of the display has the time, and the right edge has the digital display for the date, all simple, but important functions that you'll use over and over again while filming. The display, \"\"mini\"\" though it is, is XLNT! It gives you all the information necessary about Vado HD without occluding the display at all, each one being small, digital numbers and letters.The physical layout of the camera is also ergonomically correct, with the lens at the top of the front of the case, up high next to the microphone port. The speaker (it has an external speaker which functions when viewing videos) is on the back in the lower right part of the case. To the left, in the middle of the case, is the \"\"logical controller\"\" as I call it, the master control for the camera. Right side, upper is the Off/On switch, which \"\"clicks\"\" into the case for Off or On. On the left side is the HDMI Mini-Port, and the Video-Out port...all really nicely done!It's very simple, really, to use and describe the rest of the controls also. There's a 2.5mm button in the middle of the \"\"logical controller\"\", and that's the actuator for everything, the \"\"Selector\"\". That is what you do everything with: film \"\"On\"\", stop, select, and film \"\"stop\"\"...that does it ALL! At the edge of that button is a concave group of touch controls, up, down, left and right arrows, which take a fair press to actuate, just right actually... not too heavy a hand to use these controls. Those control the selection process once into the menus, fast forward, or backward the video clips as you wish to view them, etc...These are LOGICAL controls, and they do exactly what you think they are supposed to do, nothing complex, or \"\"foreign\"\" to this setup.On the right side are the two \"\"Function\"\" switches, two \"\"clickable\"\" switches, one which selects which video clip you're about to view, the other is the TRASH button, so be careful with it when viewing videos...of course when you want to trash, or \"\"EDIT\"\" the video in question there's a prompt onscreen which confirms your action, so you can't be \"\"burned\"\" by mis-hitting that switch unless it's deliberately done. Again, easy, simple controls that do what you think they are supposed to do.You use those two \"\"Function\"\" buttons on the right in tandem also. Pressed together, at the same time yields the master menus onscreen, so you can select or change the Video Quality, Time & Date, Anti-Flicker Control (50 or 60Hz filming), Language Used, and the \"\"Instant Record\"\" feature, which I'll explain here and now: Instant Record sets the camera into this mode...any button will actuate an instant recording session, and the \"\"logical controller\"\" turns it off, with 1-minute for power-off and into standby mode. Very nice feature! Just the ticket for getting a quick shot off anytime, and easily turned back off by going into the setup menu by pressing those two \"\"clickable\"\" buttons together at the same time, and getting into the menus.The Default Mode for Power is 1 minute into \"\"Ready\"\" mode, screen off, and 5 minutes screen off will yield a shut-down of Vado HD, with a pleasant little musical tone that goes off to tell that the camera has powered off.EASY STUFF, and right-on! These are controls that anyone can get used to in a couple minutes of use...I've just described every single function of Vado HD, and I've done it in about 200 words or so..pretty Kuhl! So that's how you control the action, initiate changes in the menus, everything except:Play Back Video Clips, which is done by pressing the right side \"\"clickable\"\" switch once, and BAM! You're in \"\"Cue Videos\"\" mode, and the 1st one onscreen is the one you just, or last filmed. Click the controller again to move the clips up, and back, and push down again to view! Simple!!I like everything about Vado HD's controls, it's a lot to pack into such a small place, and Creative Labs designed the camera to be easy to use, and it is. And now to describe how you use the PC functions briefly:With a PC an AVI clip is the native format, correct? Make your movies any way, shape you want on the PC with Vado HD, and I'm not going to give a dissertation on that subject here, just suffice to say a fast CPU helps processing a ton, just like on a Mac...it IS video, not photography, and the footprint on the OS, and RAM is huge on PC as it is on the Mac OS, so the more firepower you've got in terms of RAM, and CPU power the better!Quickly, I'll sum up by giving Vado HD 5-stars across the board. The controls are EASY to master, no room for headway here, zoom works fine with a steady hand, it's just plain simple Jane Simpleton to make great movies, and clips on Vado HD. Like I wrote, be mindful of the caveats above, especially TIME in relation to your content as it will accumulate quickly and an hour will be up before you can admit, \"\"I'm  having a great time doing this stuff!\"\"The LCD is clear, clean, and plenty large enough for viewing/movie making, not in direct sunlight of course, but plenty good indoors with light on the subject. Playing back clips, for viewing and editing in the camera (read \"\"TRASH\"\" the ones you don't like), is simple also...just one click to view, navigate with the controller up and backward in your clips, and BAM! HD video is yours for the keeping!Vado HD is definitely the Best Bang for the $$$ right now, I mean it's so far ahead of the rest of them it hurts to try to describe all the reasons I bought this instead of anything else. You'll find that 2 hours is plenty of time to do most projects, by the way, and if it's longer, well, take your laptop with you, or netbook, you know? Download the videos into the laptop, erase the Vado HD with the Trash Icon clicker on the controls, and voila! Ready for more shooting!!You would need an extra battery or two, and the external charger that I am dying to get my hands on and can't buy yet, but that's the state of affairs at this point. Creative Labs said on the telephone that the charger will be in stock next week, and so will be the extra batteries.That's about it for my \"\"guide\"\" and critique. You Mac folks know that the latest Perian is v1.1.3, right? It has all kinds of enhancements for Mac, so be sure and download the latest driver/plug-in for QuickTime (Pro preferred), and all will be well with Vado HD and your Mac. PC people, you don't have a worry in the world as far as using Vado HD...piece of cake, and remember to not have too much fun!!Wavey Davey/2-14-2009\"", "The VadoHD is thin and light, with a mini-HDMI out, and the rubber finish is nice. It charges via USB.NOTE: The stupid USB jack on the bottom of the device has a rubber tab that you use to pull out the USB plug. That goofy tab also means that you CANNOT prop up the VadoHD to take video! Unlike all other video cams I have seen or own, you CANNOT stand the device up to take extended video!!! You need a tripod or use it handheld - STUPID, STUPID! What were these guys thinking????The AVI is jerky on PC, even with VLC. Files do NOT import to iMovie. QT CANNOT play this without other codec.My take -  of all the lamebrained ideas - this is just stupid. The pix of the device in most reviews appears as if you can rest the Vado on a surface to shoot video - NO, you CANNOT. You cannot start it up and walk away - you must either hold it (and HD video is jerky!) or use a tripod (more to carry around). My solution? I had to cut off the tab, which in turn now requires a paperclip to dig out the USB connector.The VadoHD comes with a milky-white rubber sleeve - which clashes with the black finish - this is just plain stupid as well...The PC playback is jerky, even after you need to restart the PC after the first time you connect. You need to download crap from Creative. which is also a dumb thing to do these days!The files are AVI which do NOT import into iMovie. However, VLC for the mac (0.98a) works fine for playback.The video is clean, although a bit too color-rich and bright, but requires a steady hand and S-L-O-W panning (as with all HD video). All in all, the MinoHD may have been a better choice. That goofy tab on the VadoHD is to me a fatal flaw..."], "Gamma": [0.11082222312688828, 0.11082222312688828, 0.11082222312688828, 0.11082560569047928, 0.11082222312688828, 0.1091298833489418,
