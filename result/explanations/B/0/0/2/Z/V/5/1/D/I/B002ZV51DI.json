A few years later, it's still a monster, and this keyboard is still serving me well. Well worth the purchase, all the extra features are great for gaming.", "Got this keyboard for standard profile and illuminated keys. It types nice, and the illuminated red keys are nice, and have 3 separate settings. Great for gaming, or just using for productivity. And it's cheaper than most other name brand illuminated keyboards.", "I like this keyboard very much. there are three mode of back light which makes it awesome when you have limited light or playing at night. The customizable keys are excellent for strategy games like Warcraft, Starcraft, etc. They keys are silent and sensitive. You can customize your keys and the automatic application recognition would remember your settings each time you use that particular application. So there is no need to re-program the keys every time you switch applications. Love it.", "I use this keyboard for EVERYTHING! It works as a fantastic gaming keyboard with the ability to program macros. It is easily manageable and easy to navigate. Everything I could want in a keyboard.", "Pros:- The gloss, handrest, and lighting makes it look pretty fantastic. Has a simple LED toggle to dim or turn off the backlight too.- Feels natural and durable.- Tons of programmable keys - there are 6 programmable macro keys with 3 banks (sets) of presets - this means you can have 18 programmable macro keys. In addition, you can also have another 18 for any program of your choice - for example, three banks of six keys for Starcraft II alone. Programming these keys is as simple as recording them manually with a couple of button presses. There's also a simple enough config utility where you can fine-tune the keys' functions. You can also modify the functions of other keys like the media or calculator key if needed.- The volume toggle is especially handy and the calculator key helps too.- Works with Linux from my brief experience (I mostly run it on my laptop), although the macro/media keys don't work.Cons:- The glossy material shows fingerprints easily under adequate lighting. I haven't found this to be a huge aesthetic issue but it is there.- The play/pause/skip media keys aren't very useful as they only work with Windows Media Player. This makes them completely useless on Linux too.In conclusion, this is one of those occasional times where Microsoft suprises you with an excellent product. A great choice for a mid-range gaming keyboard, but I've seen it as low as $40 before so waiting might pay off.", "Let me start by saying that I currently own a Sidewinder x6, and this is probably the flagship gaming keyboard for Microsoft.  I love it (better than the Steelseries keyboards I had prior), and am happy to see that Microsoft has made a great follow-up to it.First the X4 is a full keyboard with function and media keys integrated into the body.  It has a non-removable wrist-rest, which like the X6 is annoying.  However, it has upgraded to larger rubber feet and raise-able back feet to keep the keyboard elevated on an angle like most keyboards (the x6 doesn't do this).  However as a step back from the X6, the X4 doesn't have a movable number keypad.  On the X6, you could move it to either right or left side of the keyboard depending on your gaming needs.Second is the anti-ghosting abilities of the X4.  If you're a gamer, this will matter to you; if not, don't worry about it.  This is THE biggest improvement over the X6 keyboard, but I question the functionality of it.  The X6 can only simultaneously press up to 6 keys and they are shift, alt, W, A, S, D.  In the X4, Microsoft upped the ante and made it so that the keyboard can support 26 simultaneous keystrokes--most of you don't have that many fingers and toes so it really doesn't matter, right?The things that I like least are the removal of the light and volume knob controllers in favor of digital buttons on the X4.  While this gets rid of some bulkiness of the X6, it also limits your fine tuning of your backlighting and volume control.  You only have 3 levels of backlighting on the X4.  Also, a big distractor for me is the decision to limit programmable keys to ONLY 6.  You can actually get 18 different programmable buttons because of the mode-change button.  However, on the X6, there were 30 programmable keys (90 different configs for the three modes).  Makes you wonder if you really need anti-ghosting if you have that many programmable buttons.So the big issue is, how much will this cost me?  The x6 currently retails at $80, but can be bought on sale for around $60.  The x4 retails at $60, but can be found for $40 or less if you look hard enough.  For the $20 difference, I say go with the X6.  But if you are in a money crunch, the x4 is a great alternative.  Really, there is nothing wrong with the newer keyboard and the upgrades are really worth it, but they've taken away a lot of the finesse that you could use to create your own customized keyboard in the x6.  Either way you go, you'll do alright.  Can't wait to see what gaming keyboard Microsoft comes up with next.P.S.  If you are just a normal computer user who games periodically, the x4 and x6 are definitely not for you.  Take a look at my review of the Logitech MK260 review for something more in your ballpark.", "This Microsoft keyboard was automatically recognized within windows 7 and the software to configure the buttons works great. I would recommend this for gaming as well due to the contoured W key and the back lighting that is blood red. It has S1-S6 function keys for in game play that are easily programmed. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would rank this as high as some of my higher priced keyboards. If you can get this keyboard under $50.00 dollars then it is a must have . I hope this review ultimately makes up your mind when choosing a reasonably priced keyboard that truly is not cheap and does what any PC enthusiast would need.", "\"I'll compare this keyboard to the Logitech G110 since both are targeted at the gaming community. I realize that a better comparison might have been with the Sidewinder X6 (which is priced closer to the G110), but I only have the X4 and the G110 at hand. Please interpret/extrapolate this comparison as appropriate.Ergonomics and Construction:======================The keys are well spaced, and have a nice \"\"feel\"\" to them, except that the space bar key is  clackier than my G110. The construction is also fairly solid and is close to that of the Logitech.However:A major problem for me is the palm rest which is both narrower and steeper. This makes for an unnatural and fatiguing typing experience.In addition, the Esc key is really tiny. I was surprised at how often I needed to use this key, and it was upsetting to end up hitting the larger and juicier bank selection key instead.Programming:==========You can set the programmable keys to run a macro, to launch an application, to start a web page, to open a file, to execute a keystroke, or one of several preprogrammed actions (such as find text within a document, print, paste, etc.)The interface is simple, and even macros are easy to configure. What's really cool about the macro wizard is the ability to click mouse keys, to set time delays between key presses (up to 1000 seconds), and to hold a key down for a given number of milliseconds (again up to 1000 secs).Comparison with the Logitech G110:============================1. There's no way to disable the Windows key from within a game. This is extremely useful for little children (and occasionally me).2. The backlight color cannot be changed. It is a nice orange - though I prefer blue  - and can be set at three levels of intensity or turned off altogether.3. You still get customizable keys with a default profile, and automatic profiles per application/game. However, you only get 6 programmable keys. These keys are nicely placed though, have dimples on alternate keys, and should be more than sufficient - especially, since you have 3 banks, effectively giving you 18 programmable keys.4. There are no audio headphone/headset options as with the G110. No USB port either.Conclusion:=========Overall, this is a very capable keyboard and a bargain at this price point.However, the biggest knock I have against it is its wrist pad - which I simply cannot get used to. Even more annoying is the fact that I can't simply replace the wristpad as it's fused to the body.Ergonomics are an individual/personal experience - and your experience might differ significantly from mine. As a result, I'd highly recommend road testing this keyboard before you decide.Happy Typing!\"", "So what makes a gaming keyboard? At the heart of it, of course, are programmable buttons, and profiles which can be set up and then switched between with the press of a button. Secondarily, but only a little less crucial it would seem, comes wicked good looks. This keyboard does a solid job with the former, and a so-so job with the latter. For a general-use keyboard, it is quite decent.Microsoft aimed this keyboard for the budget-minded, but serious, gamer. As such it is fairly heavy on function, but only achieves a passing grade on construction and extras. It is low-profile, fairly simple in look and feel, and doesn't have as slick a feel as gaming keyboards which cost twice as much. Go figure. But it does have its classy touches, like the backlit keys (the dark orange doesn't match with any other computer hardware I have seen, but it does look cool) and the jutting row of utility buttons on the top edge. Why a gaming keyboard needs a dedicated calculator button is beyond me, but since I use it for general purposes more than gaming anyway, it works out fine. The media buttons work with Zune, which is my preferred media player on Windows.All in all, this is a peripheral which somewhat inexplicably fills a dubious gap. The budget-minded PC gamer who wants an understated piece of hardware, or the savvy computer user who wants a better-looking keyboard without paying the price for a high-end model, might do well to pick this thing up for under $50. It is designed well, handles well, and seems reasonably durable. But if style is a priority to you, save your pennies and go with a costlier, but cooler, model.", "I was deciding between this and a comparable keyboard offered by Logitech. I chose to go with this one because i like low-profile keys and they are REALLY nice.Pros:- The keys are what make this keyboard. They have a nice feel and aren't those huge, clunky keys.- Works in your BIOS- Software is straight-forward, easy to install and use.- Sturdy build quality, keys last and wont feel wobbly after a year.- Looks very nice, especially with the red lights (no light leaking around the edges of the keys)Cons:- Only comes in one color (hey, i know i'm just being picky but who doesn't like more colored lights?)- Collects more fingerprints than a detective.- Quite heavy- Wrist/hand rest is not removable (even though i doubt i would remove it anyways)I love everything about it and i know it lasts a long time because my friend has one and it is about a year and a half old and looks and feels brand new.So glad i chose this keyboard and i recommend it to anyone looking for a not too expensive gaming keyboard or for just typing in the dark.", "I'm not a huge gamer so I didn't buy this for gaming.  I'm also running Linux so the software doesn't apply to me and therefore I cannot program any keys with macros or anything of that nature.  There are a few things that I'm not fond of about this keyboard:1. I really don't like the red backlighting.  I had never seen one with red keys but do own another keyboard (Logitech wireless K800 for my media system) and a laptop (Macbook Pro) that have white backlighting.  I think the white backlighting is a little easier on the eyes.2. I am not a fan of the wrist rest at all.  I wish they didn't have this on the keyboard at all -- or at least made it detachable.All in all it's not a bad keyboard for the price though if you really want illuminated keys.  While I'm not a huge fan of the color, the backlighting seems even across all of the keys and has 3 different levels of intensity that you can cycle through.  The keys are definitely visible in the dark.  The keyboard feels solid as well.I ultimately wound up purchasing this keyboard because it was considerably cheaper than the Logitech models.  Also, the wired Logitech keyboard (with illuminated keys) has that really annoying layout for the Enter key, and due to the giant delete key the insert key is also moved.  That funky layout is an immediate deal-breaker for me.The K800 has the standard key layout but again I didn't want to shell out the cash for another K800 and I didn't need this particular keyboard to be wireless.  If I had to do it again, I'm not sure if I would buy this again or not.  If money were no object I would have bought another K800 without question.  It has softer keys which some people don't like, but I personally think it's a much better keyboard than this one.", "\"I'll admit up front that I'm not a gamer and spend most of my time using a keyboard for boring stuff like typing.I bought this based on the reviews, because it's backlit (I like that), and for the macro keys that I plan on setting up to speed workflow when I process photos.The big problem for me is that the keys are a bit... muddy.  My previous keyboard was a Logitech G11 and it was just too big for my desk.  I briefly tried a Logitech K750.  It fell short in the backlight and macro keys department and also, I usually keep the light in my office kind of dim and there wasn't enough light to power it.  However, even that low profile keyboard had a better \"\"feel\"\" than this one.In addition to the muddiness, and even though I've had this only a short while, different keys are already starting to feel even looser.  My sense is that while Microsoft has done a lot to cram a lot of features and functions into the X4 they had skimped a bit on overall quality.Speaking of features, and to end on a positive note, the media control keys, at least volume up/down and mute, work for every app I've tried, not just Windows Media Player as is suggested in other reviews.I'm not suggesting this is a bad keyboard or one to avoid, just that if your primary purpose is to type stuff then there may be better choices available.UPDATE 1 Week Later:  I thought that perhaps the typing issues I was having were related to differences on key spacing (from my previous keyboard) or my need to adjust to different key \"\"action\"\".  Turns out, neither was the case.  Over the past week the keyboard had become somewhat less reliable and a bit more difficult to use.  My original opinion us the same, though a bit more polarized.  This is good keyboard if you like something that's backlit and with extra features.  However if you spend most of your time typing then you may be happier with something else.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  Please let me know if you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.\"", "This is an excellent gaming keyboard that just plugs and plays and is also ideal for productivity uses. The software that comes with this keyboard actually makes it worse, it kept freezing and crashing on me, and all kinds of weird glitches started cropping up, but I simply uninstalled it and it went back to the way it was and everything was fine again.", "I have to say that I love this keyboard.  I am not a gamer on the computer so that macro keys are a little but overkill for me however the keyboard feels very comfortable.  Overall the construction is very tough and the keys feel very sturdy.  The only complaint I do have is that there is no USB hub but that is in no means a deal breaker.  The software allows you to setup the macro keys and there are a lot of options. I addition you can setup macro keys to react differently inside of different programs which is very convenient.  The best part is this keyboard looks amazing in a dark room.", "I bought this board becuase I am a big video game player and I wanted the anti-ghosting technology it offers. Owned it for almost two months now. Games such as Crysis Wars and others play noticiable better with this keyboard.With my old Saitek Eclipse keyboard it would take me 3-7 tries to press W+Space+Shift+Ctrl to crouch and jump inside the vents. With this board I seem to get it every single shot on the first try, I immediately could tell this keyboard was far superior than the eclipse in this case.Cons: The left shift key is small and it took a few days of getting use to it.", "I am not a gamer so reviewing this on gaming capabilities would not be fair.  Other reviewers covered that aspect.  But for those of us just typing, or working, this keyboard is good.  Installation with Vista was seamless.This keyboard is nice, the keys are comfortable, and it has the ten key to the side.  It also has a column of macro keys which for me is not important.  Another reviewer had problems with keys sticking and I haven't found any of those kinds of problems.The keyboard has little legs for elevation, and a wrist rest that is not removable.  The rest is comfortable but I like to be able to choose whether I want a rest or not.Good:  long cord, nice keyboard, solid, heavy construction, comfortable to use, lots of possibilities for gaming and it has an adjustable backlight feature (my favorite).  If the family is watching a movie in semi-dark conditions, I can still type and actually see the keys.Not good:  keys are a little loud, wrist rest is not removable, has a shiny surface which will scratch easily.Overall, I think this keyboard is worth owning.", "Update July 2014:Keyboard is still going strong after 2 years of computing and PC gaming. Lights have been still going strong as well.Original Review:Bought two of these keyboards, one for my brother and one for myself. Both have been working flawlessly since purchase. The keys aren't very loud and the illumination is crisp and adjustable. The keys are very responsive and have no issues with ghosting or key lag. Having a lit keyboard helps tremendously also when doing late night homework and having a few frag sessions between assignments. Nice feel to the keys and nice weight to the keyboard.", "Great keyboard and easy to use. Much cheaper than many other keyboards with macros. Speaking of macros, very easy to use and set up. Would be nice if it came in, or had the option to change the backlit colors. Orange/red doesn't go with my build theme but not docking stars for that. Got it for $40 on sale", "I've used this keyboard for about a month. Thus far, it has performed at an acceptable level. On the plus side, the keyboard defaults to its brightest setting of red illumination. Conversely, the feel of the keys is a bit soft, which is the norm for inexpensive keyboards. In all fairness, while it does not compare well in terms of illumination or feel to my $140 X-Armour backlit mechanical keyboard, it is entirely acceptable for a $40 keyboard.Given those qualifications, I would recommend this keyboard to others. Microsoft has a good reputation in delivering good quality hardware for the price.XARMOR-U9BL Backlit Keyboard Illuminated Mechanical KeyboardIf you are willing to pay the additional $100, the X-Armour backlit mechanical keyboard is the best I've used in well over thirty years.", "I go through keyboards a lot, mainly because the lettering begins to wear off and it drives me crazy to have a keyboard that looks like crap.  I really like a keyboard with the back-lit feature for night time gaming or surfing so I decided to give the SideWinder X4 a try.Overall I am pleased with the keyboard.  The keys don't have the spring of a mechanical keyboard, but they are still pretty firm with a nice feel to them.  The back-lighting works like a charm and there is no sign of any of the keys wearing after 8 months of hard core use, which is a victory in my book.I haven't even really used any of the different gaming modes or hot-key features so I'll leave those to another reviewer.  What I will say is that I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a good quality back-lit keyboard and doesn't want to spend the money on a mechanical unit.", "\"If you had a standard keyboard prior to this purchase, you'll take to this immediately but I found it difficult to switch from my now ancient Natural Keyboard as I found the keys to be rather close together for my big hands.  My wrists tend to come together too much while the hands snap outward in order to adjust to this keyboard.  For all the documentation on ergonomics and proper usage via their \"\"Healthy Computing Guide\"\", I would expect heavy keyboard users to start experiencing symptoms of RSI after a while.The buttons make noise when typing but it's not the common \"\"click\"\".  You hear the sound of the key as you take your finger off and the key snaps back up.  All keys are backlit to where they are viewable in complete darkness.  Pressing a button with an icon of a lightbulb switches the backlighting to one of three brightness levels or a completely off level.  When the lights are on, it's difficult to see any visible evidence of backlighting except a slight red hue at the brightest setting.  All keys are illuminated and the only problem I can see it potential difficulty determine which of the three macro bank settings is currently enabled in complete darkness.Function keys have reduced height (same width) and the tab key has become skinnier.  Fortunately, the arrow keys have returned to the three across and one on top as opposed to the nasty \"\"T\"\" shape that everyone hates. Volume buttons are separated slightly from the other media buttons, which is nice as these tend to be the only ones I regularly use.  Web buttons like browser open, check email are no longer but they can be programmed in using a macro.  According to Crunchgear, we can't make the media keys open anything except Windows Media Player. Unfortunately, the Windows key is still in it's normal, annoying location between the ctrl and alt keys.  Whoever invents a decent \"\"gaming\"\" keyboard with the Windows key out of the way will become an instant millionaire.In spite of having the driver software installed prior to use as directed, I was still prompted to restart the computer.  Once the software was installed (again) it opened a help file explaining how to use features that are apparently not on this keyboard (i.e. cruise control, detachable keypad).I like the backlighting adjustments and the anti-ghosting features which makes the keyboard \"\"remember\"\" keypresses even if you press a large number at once.  Great for very fast typists.  Still, this is hard to recommend over the advanced features of the similarly priced X6 (it's been out for a while).  I don't like how small it feels compared to a split keyboard so hopefully we will see an ergonomic version in the future.\"", "Great keyboard. I got it to replace my Razr Lycos keyboard which sucks. I dont think you can beat the sidwinder x4 for the price and functionality. I have the keyboard on my lap a lot since I use my tv for my computer and the palm rests on the keyboard work nicely.", "Good keyboard, the only weirdness is if you do get an international version (french, for example) then the key map does not line up with the keyboard standard, which means it's difficult to get Windows to understand what you're doing. Other than that, good keyboard, and intuitive, actually nifty function keys/macros at the top and left side.", "The keyboard has worked flawlessly.  There are a couple small things I would change if I were designing this myself (like making the ESC key the only button in the upper left corner) but it's still awesome.I like being able to dim the back-light at night too.", "This is the second one I've purchased. First one was a couple years ago and I spilled milk on it....I use mechanical keyboards at home and work so this keyboard isn't really something for me personally, but my Fiancee loves it. The keys are fairly stiff for a rubber dome key mechanism, and overall the build quality is fairly high all things considered. At the retail price of $70 this keyboard is obviously not a good deal, as you can spend that much on a decent mechanical keyboard. But this was on sale for $35.99 the other day, and with prime shipping, I couldn't pass it up.The lighting is good and consistent across all of the keys.The special function keys and macro keys are nice if you like that sort of thing. I use a Das Keyboard and a Filco with 105 Keys so I think they're completely useless personally, but it's all about personal preference. If I'm using a keyboard with macro keys I always end up binding them to Tilde, Tab, Caps Lock, L. Shift, L. Control...The wrist pad/rest is nice looking and the texture is really cool. Unfortunately unless you have hands the size of a small child's, then it's pretty useless. My hands don't even come close to being able to rest on it.Overall, really nice keyboard if you can find it at a good price &#60;$40.", "I had really hoped this would be the best keyboard for me, after having a bad experience with key blocking (ghosting) on the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard (shift+w+space doesn't register).  While the X4 resolves any kind of key ghosting/blocking, it comes at a price. The keyboard feels awful to type on, and has some poor design choices:1) The worst problem with the keyboard is the terrible typing feel.  It's clackety mush, for lack of a better description. There is too much resistance but not enough travel depth to the keys.  Additionally, unlike some better keyboards, all key rows are at the exact same height (meaning they are all flat, and not angled at all), which results in more error prone typing if you are a touch typist. They say they were striving for a combination between desktop and laptop keyboards, but they seem to have inherited the worst features of both.2) Unlike better designed keyboards, there is NOT a small gap in between A and Caps Lock. I find myself constantly hitting Caps Lock by accident.3) The red backlight is indeed bright enough, but is unfortunately more towards pink than a nice deep red. It looks red enough when viewed head on, but from a normal seating or typing position it becomes pure pink! The color cannot be changed.4) Probably because of the advanced anti-ghosting feature (which seems to be the best feature of this keyboard), it will not work AT ALL through a KVM switch with Windows 7. It's not a matter of special keys not working, or the software not recognizing the board, as with some keyboards, but rather a complete failure to install any kind of keyboard driver. I'm a seasoned IT pro and I was completely unable to get Windows 7 to recognize this KB through a KVM switch. Oddly, XP had no issue with the KB when attached to the KVM.Now, it's not all bad news: The anti-ghosting is perfect, the macro feature is perfect, the media keys are perfect, and the calculator key is a brilliant touch.If you can stand shift+w+space keyblocking issue, I'd strongly suggest the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard over this. I'm afraid this needs to go back to the drawing board. That is unfortunate, because I typically love Microsoft products like the 360, Zune, and Windows.", "I set this keyboard up expecting to try it out and then switch back to my Logitech Wave. I never thought I'd love a backlit keyboard so much, but I can't imagine using a keyboard without backlit keys now. It really makes a difference in my lamp lit office and it looks really sleek on my desk and doesn't take up too much space. My cordless Wave has gone off to my son's room.I do have two complaints about this keyboard though:The wrist rest is useless and there for aesthetics only.The orange backlight doesn't blend well with my router lights, speaker lights, or external hard drive lights, which are blue. I would have liked to have seen this available in blue or orange backlighting, or better yet, if they keyboard could switch colors.I also love the sound buttons and calculator button, which are common on after market keyboards but certainly worth mentioning. I have played with the macros a little bit, and I'm glad the feature is there, but I'm hung up on one keystroke that will make or break the usefulness for me.The price is fantastic and I like the look and feel of this keyboard.", "I'll start off by saying I'm not a gamer, but desire a lighted keyboard.  I've been a faithful Saitek Eclipse II user for a few years now, preferring a well made keyboard along with one that lights.  Although my current Saitek fits the bill, sometimes the brightness of the illuminated keyboard is not to my liking and I wish it could be brighter.  While the Saitek has 3 colors to choose from, this Sidewinder has one color (red) with 3 levels of brightness.  The brightest is perfect for me and the lower 2 setting are useless.  They Sidewinder is well made, just like the Eclipse II.  I prefer the overall look of the Eclipse II.  I'm not crazy about the Sidewinders look.  The face is too shiny, and every little speck of dust/dirt shows and omg, the fingerprints.  Whether the keys are illuminated or not, the shininess of the Sidewinders keys make it tough to see in bright overhead office lighting.  I'm generally not a fan of the hand wrist and opted not to attach mine on the Saitek, but the Sidewinders is not removable.  I honestly thought it would be in my way, but surprisingly it is not, and I find it quite comfortable while typing.  I do find the extended keyboard a bit distracting and it might take me a while to get used to it.  The Saitek Eclipse III has been on my wishlist for quite some time now, but it's too pricey and doesn't seem to be dropping to one that would attact me.  Considering the quality and price of this keyboard, I'd recommend it.  If you tend to hover on the computer in no or low light, this keyboard is great.", "I love this keyboard.
