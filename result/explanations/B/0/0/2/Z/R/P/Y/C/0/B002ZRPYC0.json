The Archerfish Solo is unique in that it also has a built-in DVR, plus an optional value-added service that makes it much more useful and effective. This means you can monitor a site without buying additional equipment, other than the necessary broadband Internet connection. The camera package comes with a 2 Gb micro SD memory card that you insert into a slot behind a rubber cover door on the camera. The housing seems to be built to withstand harsher outdoor environments, although it can be used indoors perfectly. Strangely, this camera is NOT equipped with Infra-red LEDs to aid lighting when it is too dark, and consequently would produce videos that would not be clear and sharp. On the other hand, cameras with IR LEDs emit a faint but visible red tinge that may draw unwanted attention, so you need to consider whether the lack of IR LEDs is a good thing or bad.In order to be able to see the camera video from outside your home, you need to enable port-forwarding on your router's firewall. This is not something that most users would know how to do. Archerfish has an excellent technical support staff to help with that. They actually walked through the entire process with me until I was able to see the video from the Internet. Before you buy any Internet camera, be sure to check if the vendor can help you to set it up.  Archerfish was especially helpful in that the technician even contacted my ISP (AT&T;) for me and engaged in a three way conference call to try to resolve my problem. It turned out that the 2-Wire 3800-HGV router provided by AT&T; had a obscure glitch, which would not port-forward even when configured correctly. AT&T; quickly replaced my router within 2 hours, and then I was able to view video sent from the Archerfish Solo on the Internet.Other than Archerfish, Lorex is another company that can help its customers with setting up for Internet access. Both companies use a remote control software to temporarily control you PC. Since you can see on your screen what they are doing, there isn't much to worry about. Just be sure to close the remote control window and software afterward.An important feature that I like about the Archerfish Solo is that it comes with a 3-month premium service which provides text and video alerts  that you can setup to send to your email address and smart phone. After the free trial period, there is a charge of $5 plus $0.99 per camera per month. For one camera, the per month charge is therefore $5.99. At first, this may seem like a luxury, but this is really the distinguishing feature between video surveillance/monitoring and video recording.Security companies typically charge upwards of $40 or more for home monitoring using a combination of contact and infra-red motion sensors and video cameras. Seen in this light, the Archerfish premium service of $5.99 for one camera then looks like a bargain, and you get video clips sent to your email and phone as soon as an event takes place. If the situation warrants, you can then contact your local law enforcement to investigate.I have my Archerfish Solo aimed at the entrance door and window from 30 feet away, and a slight opening of the door would trigger the motion detector. This is really amazing, and it demonstrates that motion detection by \"\"video image analysis\"\" is just as good as it is done by contact or infra-red sensors. You can setup the software to detect human, vehicle, and motion. Additionally, you can indicate which areas in the video are detection zones. And then there is automated temper detection, such as loss of power to the Archerfish Solo, or poor video. You will also be notified of these system events via email and smart phone message.If you just want video recording of your home or business, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, but video recording would NOT allow you to take action as events happen. The recording may provide evidence of intrusion, if the intruder had not also taken the camera and DVR equipment when breaking into your home or business premises.I highly recommend the Archerfish Solo Wireless Intelligent Video Surveillance System with built-in DVR, especially if you want to set it up fast with the help of its technical support people. If you are comfortable setting up port-forwarding and configuring an IP camera, you can take a look at this:Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67 Viewing Angle) - Black NEWEST MODEL (replaces the FI8908W)It is considerably cheaper and has infra-red LEDs and pan & tilt functions (but no built-in DVR), plus event notification by email (just like Archerfish Solo), BUT you must do everything yourself. You will NOT get any technical support from Foscam. If you are technically inclined, you can refer to documents and manuals at [...]t. They are more informative than the terse manual in the box.Foscam of the US states very clearly that it will only provide free technical support to customers who purchase DIRECTLY from its US website. Of course, the price is much higher ($149) than it is here at Amazon, but it is still cheaper than Archerfish Solo. I do not know about the quality of its technical support though.\"", "Update 1/16/13: Before you consider this product, find out who is running the show now and how much it costs. After a couple of years of using this to simply check my driveway from my home office, which the free service it was sold on allowed, I get an e-mail saying Archerfish is now CheckVideo and I have to switch to their system. So I do and discover they no longer offer a free service, which they did when I got this. They give you 2 months free then will start charging $5 a month, but you are supposed to get all their other options. Problem is, the smartphone feature never worked with Archerfish and it only works sporadically, if at all, with CheckVideo. In addition to that, the regular camera, after the changeover, doesn't work as solidly. Has a lot of quirks. Turns UPnP off, takes forever to get an image, goes off and on, and often just doesn't work. They offer a remote app for your smartphone with a Live View button that does nothing and the Settings button leads to a dead page. Makes you log back in often. You have to go to the non-mobile CheckVideo site for any chance and then if you get anything it's just as unpredictable as your home network connection. In others words, it got worse and they want me to pay for it.&lt;Original Review, which may not be relevant anymore>I work in an office behind my garage and I wanted to be able to monitor the driveway. It serves the main purpose I wanted one for, but there may be some key (optional) features that may not work for you. Overall, it is a fairly easy product to use, but, for me, it does not do everything advertised (hence the 3 stars on Bait and Switch attribute) and lacks one key usability feature.Pros:1) Fairly easy to set up. I use a powerline network, so I can't speak for the wi-fi setup. Setting this up was initially easy enough. My computer recognized the camera on the network and I was able to set it up so that all I need to do is click on a bookmark on my browser to access it. (A true plug and play ability did not work for me and I needed tech support, see Cons, to complete the set up, though)2) Clear view during the day, fair enough in the dark. Day time viewing is clear and at night it makes out things like cars coming in and out and you can make out people if outdoor lights are on. Good enough for me, but it is not a night vision system, if that's what you need.3) Excellent customer service. Easy to get to, fast response, very knowledgeable tech support.4) Reliable connection. Seems to stay on all the time and when there is a network hiccup, it fixes itself.Cons:1) Does not allow long term desktop monitoring. This is a key usability feature missing and something they should think about. I'm sure there are many buyers of this product like me who work at home and just want to be able to glance at a computer screen to see the driveway view. The software does have the ability to pop out a small monitoring window that sits on your desktop screen, however, the live view only lasts 15 minutes or so at a time. You have to keep re-logging in in order to get a live view. I think this is a significant deficiency, but check to see if they fix this in the future.2) Not 100% accurate. The software has a good ability to detect cars, people or motion, but the motion sensor is too sensitive and can't really be used (it interprets passing cloud shadows as movement!). In order for it to tell the difference between objects, I found the camera must be placed no higher than the top of a door. I originally mounted it looking out a second floor window, but it could not distinguish between any of the objects it is supposed to detect (the monitoring alerts specify, cars, people, motion; it is supposed to ignore cats, rabbits, etc.). I believe it needs a lower angle of view in order to judge height and width (a person would be tall and narrow, versus a car's wide and lower). In addition, I know for sure it does not capture all events. For example, I often would see things like a person walking into the garage, but not back out. I know for sure it completely missed several instances of me walking across its field of view. I do not know what percent of events it misses (probably low), but you have to wonder if it may miss a significant one.3) May require additional configuration/tech support to make it work through your gateway. While it is supposed to be compatible with plug and play technology, I have yet to find a tech gadget that sets up that easy. I even bought the newest, most advanced cable modem/gateway in order to have the latest plug and play technology. However, I still had to set up port forwarding, which just isn't something the average home owner is that familiar with. BTW, Vonage users may have issues.4) Does not pan (missing feature). It is a set view, which, fortunately, is wide and high enough for its purpose as a driveway monitor.Paid services versus freeIt comes with a 90 day trial of its premium services. They do not send out a courtesy e-mail reminding you when the 90 days is up, by the way. They just start charging. I caught it but as of this writing I have not heard if they are going to credit my card for the month they charged me.1) The premium service is supposed to allow you to view a live or recorded feed on another computer or your mobile device. I think it may be worthwhile if I could see the camera view from my mobile device, but we could never get it to work. My android phone has all the latest updates and the signal strengths were good when I tested it, but the mobile app simply crashes and via the web site portal I could never see live or recorded video. The only part of the service that I could get was a snapshot of what it detected. This is better than nothing (at least I could see if the UPS guy was there), but the majority of the paid feature would not work for me. Maybe if I spent even more time with tech support I could have got it to work, but since I did not go with the paid service, it is not needed.2) The paid service sends e-mails, if you want, when it detects something. This is a good feature if you are out of town, but if you have kids and/or an active driveway, the e-mails pile up. I did change monitoring times for the weekends, but there is too much activity to keep up with.3) Included is the ability to use a virtual DVR of what the camera sees. The paid service stores a greater numbers of days (not sure how many) and the free service stores maybe 2 day's worth. The paid service allows you to jump to recorded events while the free service is just a running review.4) The recorded video snips of detected events are short(the snips can be e-mailed, so that's one reason they are short). You have to go into the DVR section and find the spot it was recorded to watch the whole thing. That takes some clicking around on a mobile device. It would be nice if the snips were longer or you could adjust the amount of time recorded.At this point, I am just using the free service and it works well for my intended need. It is frustrating I can't keep a constant monitoring on my desktop, but at least I have something.I think this product and company, however, does have an easier to use product. I also bought a Panasonic camera and the first thing I discovered is that under a veneer of consumer friendly packaging, their product instructions require an engineering degree to appreciate.", "This is a nice DVR capable camera great for residential/small office use.  The Camera is easy to set up and took me about 30 minutes to get up and running.  You will need Broadband Internet service and a wireless router with available ports in order to use this.  The camera is capable of being used indoors and outdoors.  It'll take some work to hard wire the electrical into your home if you don't want the power cords showing.  When you set this camera up, you will be required to create an account with Archerfish.  You get a free 90 day premium service trial, and after that they charge you. If you don't want to pay, make sure you mark the date on your calendar and cancel.I currently use this camera with the free service.  You don't get all the bells and whistles without paying $6 a month, but I also have ADT monitoring, so this is just a nice plus to have at my house.  It's especially great to see who is ringing the door bell before I get to the door from my office. It's quite bulky so if you don't want people to know they re being watched, you will need to conceal this in a more creative way, or place it indoors facing the window.This device is worth the money, and I highly recommend it.", "\"The Archerfish Solo works well after you can finally get it working.  During the initial setup, everything seemed like it was working properly and correctly.  While hardwired to my router, I had no problem.  After setting up wireless configuration and getting a confirmation message from the system, I unplugged the Ethernet cable and proceeded to mount the camera at its remote location.  After I plugged the camera in, nothing...I tried this several times but I could not get the wireless connection going.  **As a side note, when I set up my account, I mistyped my email address and couldn't get back into my account.  And when I tried the retrieval link, i never received anything because I would get a \"\"your user name has been sent to your email address\"\" but since i mistyped my email address the first time, I never got anything and the system didn't tell me the email address was wrong.  I had to contact customer service to correct the problem.**  This took me quite a while to resolve but the customer service is quite knowledgeable and respond pretty quickly.The initial setup includes a \"\"premium service\"\" that allows additional features such as Detection Zones.  This is where you draw zones within the camera's field of view and can designate each of these zones separately.  I like this feature because you can mark out the area around the door and set that so that any activity your are notified, and mark the area around the pet's food bowls to a low or no warning zone so that their regular movement won't trigger alert messages sent to you.  While this feature is great, it does cost $5.00 plus $0.99 per Solo camera.  I don't think that service is quite worth it for the cost.Lastly, I would really have like to be able to record to a computer connected to the home network.  While it's great that I can view from any internet connected computer and even an iPhone or Droid device (also requires premium service) I would also like to have the capabilities to record locally, that would have gotten it the fifth star.While this device can be a little hard to set up, mainly due to wireless router security issues, it is a pretty good system/service that should be considered if you want to put in a security/surveillance system in your home or business\"", "The Archerfish is a stand-alone wireless surveillance system that has a built in DVR. The system is easy to setup and since everything is contained in one unit, there isn't much to connect to get it going. The camera takes decent video that should meet most peoples needs. There are a few things I wish were different, including the way Archerfish makes you setup an account on their website and makes you take a free trial for the premium service instead of just creating a basic free account. The DVR is expandable via an SD card, but I think it should come with a larger card anyway. For home users, the system may fit their needs to keep an eye on their house or yard. However if you want to be serious about a surveillance system, I would suggest a Lorex or similar DVR camera system that has room for expansion and separates the DVR from the camera. They are more expensive, but I think make a better investment. So, if you just need a very basic camera system that is self contained, the Archerfish may be a good fit. However if you are looking for more of a professional system, this isn't it.", "\"Amazon.com lists several IP cameras but this camera has an additional feature because it also has a built-in DVR. All you need is a broadband Internet connection, and a router. The installation is a breeze, since the installation instructions are easy to follow. The surveillance videos are clear enough, and the zones to be monitored could be set to your preference. There is an optional service with the company that may help if you are stuck. The package contains a micro SD memory card, which is ready for use. The camera can be mounted indoor or outdoor, but when it is dark, the pictures may not be good since the unit does not have Infra-red LEDs.

The camera is easy to mount.  I installed mine in an office reception area, high in a corner.2. The video quality is good enough to identify persons in the frame.  Although the unit requires light, I have gotten usable video in dusky, late afternoon conditions.3. One can easily configure the camera to record events occurring in a specific area of the camera's field of view.  Preventing the camera from recording every event saves memory card space.4. Configuring the remote view functionality is super easy if one's router supports UpNP.5. If there is no UpNP, port forwarding is required. The Archerfish web site provided basic port forwarding info.  However, I had to goodle Port forwarding to complete the job with Centurylink Zyxel 660 series DSL modem.  Even though it supports UpNP, I could not get remote view to work without port forwarding.6. It is easy to view video, live and recorded, on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.  I have the android market Archerfish app for my Samsung Captivate.  It works great.7.  Wireless works great.  I have not used an Ethernet cable.Now, the not so good:1. The camera is on the largish side, not very inconspicuous.  If one does not want persons to know they are under surveillance, the Solo is not the answer unless it is very well camouflaged.2. Because the camera records to an onboard memory card, an intruder could remove the camera and take the incriminating video footage with him.2. No night recording.3. No HD.4. The capacity of the included MicroSDHC is too small.  Decreasing video quality increases the amount of video the card stores.5. No ability to turn, focus, or zoom the camera.  Not a biggie because the price of this unit is in-line with its functionality.All in all, a nice unit for basic surveillance where it is not critical to preserve the footage remotely or prevent persons from noticing the camera.", "\"NOTE:The review below was written BEFORE I read probably your best source for 3 camera comparison tests done by Popular Mechanics in the April 2011 Issue. I recommend you read that issue for a great shoot out between this cameras and 2 others including the Logitech Alert & Avaak Vue models.MY Review (with non working camera...)When I saw I was getting this to test in the Vine program I KNEW I had finally scored. I have wanted something like this for ages. Then it arrived......Began the setup and would NOT configure with my new Linksys E2000. It did not offer the same encryption options as I have set mine to so finally I gave up & called \"\"support\"\". A polite & knowledgeable man came on and this is where I REALLY got uncomfortable. I had to allow him to completely take over my computer \"\"REMOTELY\"\"! I REALLY THINK THIS IS INSANE, but I decide to allow it & then when hanging up go into my router & change ALL my info for security. And I really see NO reason for this intrusion to be able to \"\"see\"\" what the problem is? a big strike 1......OK, I sit here watching my computer while it is like HE is doing all the typing (since he IS!) and see on my screen as he reconfigures my router. Says finally that I am good to go. So we hang up and I go back and again change all my passwords etc. I am VERY uncomfortable now, and on a lot of levels. But as they say, wait, there's more. I now follow the directions and go about disconnecting the camera from my router and setting up the base etc. Go into my living room when done to plug it in and wait for the green light to appear after cycling through and connecting to my network wireless this time. In the meantime I never see that green light but a flashing orange so figure give it more time, go back into my computer room to finish my sign up for FREE service. BIG STRIKE 2.....Now I type in a ton of info to sign up and when I am FINALLY ready I get to \"\"billing\"\". Yeah, NOT so free after all. Turns out even if you never ever want their \"\"premium service\"\" you STILL have to try it for 3 months and give up your credit card info. I call back & they refuse to let me try their \"\"alleged\"\" free level service without FIRST having my credit card and \"\"approving\"\" my credit? At this point I am FAR beyond \"\"uncomfortable\"\". I hang up and decide maybe I will give it a try but first go back and make sure my camera had successfully connected to my network. Can you guess? NOPE. So open the troubleshooting guide (now 3 hours later....) and it explains to go into a little compartment where the so called (and I DO mean SO CALLED!) \"\"DVR\"\" This turns out to be a blazing little 2GB microSD is. Yeah, THAT is that great DVR? There is a button next to it to push and do this, then do that, then do the hokie pokey & turn yourself all around. O am really pissed & fed up by now and worse, I really just can't think straight thinking about just having watched someone inside my computer & scrolling through my passwords etc. I mean I am REALLY uncomfortable. Anyway, go to push that little button to reset the camera to find....a hole. Yea, a hole where a button is suppose to be. And no, it isn't recessed, it is a damned hole..... Strike 3, 4 and 5 I am done!I give this-5 (that is minus 5) at this moment but I will honor it with 2 stars simply because both times I called the company they were VERY polite, spoke English, and that just has to be worth something. But remember to factor in that I do this giving this product & company a BIG benefit of the doubt here. But I never achieved even getting this to work and on top of that, is is now obvious that it is physically broken and I never even saw it until needing to troubleshoot and found the \"\"missing\"\" button. Never ever had this happen with any Amazon Vine trial I reviewed. I suppose I will contact Amazon since they may want this back? It is useless to me and sorry I am unable to offer a proper review. Best things I can offer you is the Company employees are VERY polite, speak GREAT English. The other things I can tell you is it is NOT free, you have to give up your credit card info, you also have to use THEIR website to ever even view anything this camera is supposed to record. So all that considered, I feel like it is a BREACH of MY security. In no way toes it make me feel more secure! OK , enough I guess. Now back to going into everything on my computer to change every password I possess. This should only take me a month or so.....3/24/2011 Update:  Wish I had read the comparison test of this in the Popular Mechanics Magazine that arrived today. I never would have even bothered trying it....\"", "\"After watching the videos and reading reviews for this product, it sounds like exactly what I was looking for. Which was a wireless surveillance camera that would record, had good quality, and could be remotely viewed. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to expectations.First, out of the box, you've got your wireless camera along with a few cables. The camera must be hard wired to your network so you can run through the wizard and configure it. This includes setting it up for wireless. This is where I first ran into issues (and complaints). You have to sign up for their subscription service to actually use it and complete the setup. They did provide a 3 month free trial to use their service and all of it's features, including remote notification and alerts. Just make sure you cancel it before expiration so you aren't charged. That is of course unless you want to use the premium features.Personally, I found it far too expensive for what you get. I'll just stick with the built-in DVR and remote viewing. The rest isn't necessary for me. But let's get back to the rest of the setup wizard. It's unreliable at best. It took multiple tries just to get wireless connected. It actually wouldn't even work with my older Cisco access point. Fortunately my new AP works much better. It only took 3 tries to get that connected. :)Once you get past the buggy setup wizard, the rest is actually pretty straight forward as it's all handled through their website. That's where you can see the camera, configure everything, set it up, etc. You can watch things in \"\"near real-time.\"\" It's about a 5-10 sec delay depending on the signal. Not bad, but something to be aware of. You also must use the website, there is no local software to use or view the camera locally. Quite unfortunate.The video quality also is another issue for me. It's only VGA (640x40), which makes identifying what you are seeing on the screen somewhat difficult. In a well-lit area no more than a couple feet away, you shouldn't have a problem. But any more than that, VGA is just too low for anything more than a very basic surveillance systems. In other words, don't expect to zoom into a license plate of a car or anything. :)Pros:* Wireless or LAN connectivity* Internet-based viewing and recording* Built-in DVR* Advanced reporting & monitoring features available (subscription)Cons:* No local non-internet based software option* Expensive subscription fees for \"\"advanced\"\" features* Credit card/Trial subscription required for initial setup* Low resolution* Buggy/complicated setup wizardSo let's wrap this up and summarize why I find this hard to recommend for most folks. Basically, this isn't cheap as it is. And you have to pay pricey monthly fees to actually use most of the high-end features that are being advertised. For me, the best option is look for a better solution that can be used locally and not have to costly use web-based features.\"", "\"QUICK SUMMARY:  The Solo camera and web portal are simply not ready for a production release.  Save your money and look for alternatives.  (Be sure to read my UPDATED comments at the bottom of this review).Background:  This is my second home surveillance system, and although this product touts to be better than the 1950s-era technology my existing system uses, at least my existing system works reasonably well. By contrast, the feature-rich Archerfish Solo camera promises more than it can deliver, and has its own limitations, too.Installation and Setup:  After opening the package up, it's pretty easy to get things going -- IF you are familiar with home networking.  The \"\"Getting Started\"\" brochure explains the essential steps of installing Solo to your network.Step 1 - Add Solo To Your Network.  To do that, you plug-in Solo to the power supply and then plug-in Solo directly to an ethernet connection on your router or network switch.  Then, you download a setup wizard from the Archerfish website and run it from any networked PC in your home.  The process is pretty simple BUT you need to know the type of wireless security your router is running:  WPA?  WPA-TKIP?  WPA-PSK?  WEP?  If you don't know what these acronoms stand for, you'll likely be stumped when you're asked to explain how your wireless network is secured.Step 2 - Assemble the Solo camera.  To do this, you insert a 2GB miniSD card into the side of Solo, and then attach Solo to an installation base.  Trouble here is that the base is made of two big pieces of plastic that won't stay together until you screw-in the whole assembly into a wall or ledge somewhere.  Unlike my old surveillance system, you can't just set the Solo on a desktop or other piece of furniture -- the camera will topple over and the base assembly will disassemble if it's not screwed into something.  I also disliked having to build this base assembly by removing a rubber gasket, connecting a power cord to the camera.  Why can't the base assembly snap together?  I wasn't impressed with the plastic build, either.  Overtighten the base, and the plastic will crack.  My old surveillance system uses metal bases for the cameras that are half the size of the plastic base that comes with Solo.Step 3 - Install Solo.  This is easy.  Just screw three wood screws through the plastic base into wood somewhere on your house (my location is above the garage door).  Don't overtighten those screws!  Note, though, that the power suppply cord is only about 10' long, and so installation is limited by having to figure out how to deal with the power cord to the camera.  Although this camera is wirelessly connected to your network, it has a wired power cord!  You can install the base on a ceiling, wall, or ledge.  Once installed, it's easy to manipulate the camera angle.Step 4 - Register Solo.  Here's where you create a new account with Archerfish.  The unpleasantries here include having to offer up your credit card information for a \"\"free\"\" basic account, and reading your Solo's serial number from the \"\"Getting Started\"\" guide where the font size is so small as to be almost illegible.  I had to enter the serial number three times before getting the numbers and letters correctly, because the alphanumeric string is so tiny.  Also, I had to go through this whole registration process twice because, during the first attempt, a website glitch occurred that lost everything I had already entered into it during the multi-step registration process.Using the Solo Camera and Web PortalOnce I setup my account, I tried out the features of the web portal and camera.  You can see your camera's live video feed over the Internet from any browser (once you've logged in to your Archerfish account).  That's pretty neat!  However, setting up the zones was frustrating, as the web portal only let me create one set of events that included all three zones.  In other words, I can't create one type of event for Zone 1 and a second event for Zone 2 on the same day/time of the week.  The web form used to make these entries will suddenly have dropdown controls (where you choose days and times) that have no options from which to choose.  Not ready for prime time!!More frustrations:  The DVR feature works, but I can't extract files even though that feature supposedly exists.  It gives me an error, but no error code or reason.  I tried creating a support ticket with Archerfish through their website, but the web form that collects information from me fails to submit the support request -- the browser just goes blank, and if you hit the Back button, everything you typed is now lost.  The event recognition feature -- the killer feature that separates this camera from 1950s-era technology -- only worked for me during the daytime hours, not at night (even with my well-lit porch light on).  And even the event recognition during the day was spotty at best in its ability to do what it's supposed to do.  Sometimes it recognized people, sometimes it didn't.  Sometimes it mistook a neighborhood cat for a person.  I definitely wouldn't trust my home surveillance needs to technology that is so unpredictable and unreliable.And it strikes me as bad design that someone can walk up to my Archerfish camera and remove the miniSD card and all the stored video from the camera's built-in DVR.  (You wouldn't have that risk if you placed the camera so high you'd need a long ladder to reach it).  The website portal will only store 50MB of video -- hardly any video at all, although if the event recognition feature worked properly, that 50MB would be the important video you'd want to see.So, here's how I sum things up:WHAT I LIKE:- Best feature:  Live video streaming over the Internet to any browser!- Wired or wireless connection to your network (your choice)- The video created by the camera had good colors that didn't need any adjustment- The videos were reasonably clear and sharp for surveillance quality- Good low-light performance (I can see outside at night with just street light only)- Configuring and installing the camera wasn't too bad (but I'm an IT professional)- The concept of event recognition is great (the implementation left a lot to be desired, though)WHAT I DO **NOT** LIKE:- The Event recognition feature just didn't work well.  If this feature worked well, I'd bump up the star rating to at least 3-stars.- Couldn't export files from the camera's DVR- Couldn't create a support ticket through the web portal- The camera's base assembly is too large and stupidly designed- Very limited features to configure the camera (such as choosing frame rate), or how to be notified of events (you can only send an email to one registered email account).- No infrared capability to record in zero-light conditions.  The instructions make it clear that this camera will only work well in well-lit conditions, so you'd have to leave outside lights on all night for the Solo to work properly -- that's not energy efficient.- Requiring users to present credit card information for a \"\"free\"\" basic account, and forcing them to get \"\"free\"\" premium subscription features for three months with no opt-out choice (you risk forgetting to cancel this free subscription and getting billed later on).CONCLUSION:  This is a pricey surveillance camera.  At this cost, all the features purported by the manufacturer should work, and work very well and very reliably.  They don't.  I like the concept behind Solo, so I hope Archfisher continues to fix what's wrong and improve Solo so it fulfills all the hype.  Until then, though, I do NOT recommend the Solo surveillance camera.***** UPDATE as of April 27, 2011 *****So I've used this camera for about a month now, and have gotten acquainted with its functions and features.  I initially rated this camera 2-stars, but I'm now giving it 2.5-stars (but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, so I'm leaving my initial rating intact at 2-stars).  Why?  Because now that I've fiddled with it by changing its installation and making a device configuration setting, it's doing a better job at doing home surveillance -- but it's still not that great.A key camera configuration setting (for me, anyway) was changing the \"\"Duration\"\" setting for this camera on the web portal.  I had set it to 20 seconds, thinking it would show 20 seconds of video for any event it recognized.  Turns out, that setting doesn't control how long the video clips show (it  defaults to 10 seconds without a way to change that), rather, that camera \"\"Duration\"\" setting determines for how long something has to be moving around in the camera's field-of-vision before the camera recognizes it as an \"\"event.\"\"  When I changed this setting from 20 seconds to 5 seconds, it registered a lot more events, and I had a lot fewer missed events.BUT -- the the event recognition technology just isn't that good!  Now, I'm getting several dozen motion events consisting of a cloud passing in front of the sun, which causes shadows to appear and disappear.  Or the wind blowing a tree.  Or nothing apparent at all.  The event recognition technology is in its infancy, and it still just isn't that smart, or good.  So, I have more events to look at, which includes more of what I'm interested in, but also more of what I don't want to see.  It's noteworthy, too, that the events often don't recognize a vehicle when a car drives up, don't recognize a person when a person walks up, or, sometimes, it says it sees a car when there is none, or it sees a person when there is no one there.  It's very dicey.Even with all these warts, I do find it useful to see what's going on in my home using the web portal which can show live video streaming over the Internet, or event clips that it's registered throughout the day.  So, the overall solution is okay, but I definitely don't like the overall package.  And I'm not at all convinced that, after the free 3-month \"\"premium\"\" web portal features expire, it'll be worth the money to pay a monthly service fee to continue using those web features.***** UPDATE as of May 5, 2011 *****Another reason to dislike Solo.  Yesterday, my Solo inexplicably dropped connection to my network.  My Archerfish web account recognized this event because it logged it into the event log, but Archerfish didn't bother emailing me a notification saying that there was a problem with my Solo.  So, for the last day, while I'm thinking my Solo is watching my property, instead, it's not -- there have been no recorded events on the web portal to view for the last day.  I discovered the problem today when I logged into my web account and saw there were no recorded events in the last 24 hours (there always are such events to review).  I had to unplug/re-plug the camera to get things working properly again.  (There were no other problems in my home network, btw).  Now, imagine this scene when you're on a long vacation, and you're not home to just unplug/re-plug in the problematic camera?  I'm back to a 2-stars once more, moving closer to 1-star.This is a very pricey camera which promises more than it can reliably deliver.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0010051251156255603, 0.16631323099136353, 0.3006180226802826, 0.0034636494237929583, 0.061000674962997437, 0.0012765711871907115, 0.19020353257656097, 0.2729664742946625, 0.0006871656514704227, 0.0024655142333358526]]}
