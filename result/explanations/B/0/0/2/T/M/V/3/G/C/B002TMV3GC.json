And as for a fancy gourmet coffee drinker, I am not.  This is a European coffee flavor made from the more expensive Acabica beans.I like my coffee hot and use a Farberware coffee percolator, and have use average amount of cream, but with no sugar.  Therefore, I do not want the rich caramel and vanilla flavor since it is sweet.  This coffee has a very strong sweet smell, and it permeates, to me, a sickly sweet aroma.I tried several cups and used almost the same amount of coffee that my regular coffee takes.  This is a much finer ground of coffee was turned off by the smell each time I drank a cup.This coffee is great for those who love gourmet coffee, and I don't mind gourmet coffee, but just couldn't get past the sicklysweetsmell.  .....Rizzo", "\"I am not a coffee drinker, I have a few cups once in a while but I have never been a true fan of the taste. I always find it bitter now matter the flavor or how much sugar is added. But I have to admit, I really enjoyed the Hazelnut Creme Brulee flavor. It wasn't overpowering, in fact, I wouldn't even say it was a truly sharp hazelnut taste. It didin't have a bitter aftertaste that I was expecting from something that I already found bitter. The flavoring is very subtle and smooth. It won't make me a coffee drinker, but I would reach for this first if/when I hanker for a cup (yes, I just used the word \"\"hanker\"\").\"", "I have been drinking Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee for a bout a week.  I find it pleasant, complex, and fills the kitchen with a very pleasant smell.The grounds have very fine grind, however I had no issues with it plugging up the filter. I have been experimenting with the amount of grounds I use for each cup, and I found that I like a heaving measuring cup.  So a little more than I use for my favorite Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee.If I use less the coffee is a little weaker than I like, if I follow the instructions on the package (2 teaspoons per 6 oz cup) I find it a little too strong.  I would recommend experimenting to find just the right strength for your own taste.I love flavored coffees and Melitta measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee, while being less expensive.  I will be ordering it again in the future.Ali Julia review", "This is really one of the best coffees I've ever had. The aroma is beautiful; the taste is wonderful. It is true that there is a bit of a bitter finish, but, frankly, I like that. I'd have to say that, overall, this is a very strong coffee, and I mean that in a positive way. I love strong coffee. I highly recommend this coffee!", "This is a decent ground coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor.  I would give it a good solid four stars.  What I did not appreciate was the difficult packaging; I believe in freshness too, but this took me a long, frustrating time to get into -- yikes!!", "Hazelnut Creme Brulee sounds like it might be too sweet, but it is smooth and flavorful, not at all bitter and makes a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I have used it in both a Melitta one-cup drip and also in a french press with success, but the french press demands that you use a little more coffee to begin with.  I drink my coffee black but I can easily imagine cream or milk turning this into an almost guilty pleasure.  I also intend to make it a little stronger, chill it and add ice for a refreshing iced coffee on a hot summer day.", "I brought this coffee up to my parents' cabin on a vacation and we all drank it for about a week. No one in my family is really a coffee connoisseur (including myself), so I can't really speak to the complications of the flavor or anything like that.We did all think it was good coffee, the hazelnut flavor was clearly present but not overpowering, and it wasn't too sweetsy as some flavored coffees can be.Downsides are the proportions of coffee / water seem to be a little different than the plain ol' coffee my parents normally use. I couldn't tell if it was too strong or too weak, but something tasted a little different to me (I mean besides the hazelnut flavor). I think this coffee might require slightly more to be added to the maker before brewing to bring out the hazelnut flavor as opposed to the amount you'd add for normal coffee.This coffee tastes good w/ cream and sugar, if you're into it, or black, as I prefer. One thing I'd caution against is mixing it with those flavored 'Coffee Mate' creamers. My mom and sister were doing that and had some pretty nasty cups (Pumpkin Spice and Caramel were nasty to me). Best off drinking this stuff black or with normal cream/sugar. Probably obvious to everyone else, but some people in my family are addicted to Coffee Mate.Anyway, that's it. I'm no coffee snob but do think this is good coffee, with a nice hazelnut flavor. A little pricey compared to the good sales I can get on coffee at my local grocery store, but worth a shot if you're interested.", "\"I'll give this coffee 4.5 stars, but rounded up to five since there is no 4.5 option.  When you first open the bag, you'll notice a really terrific aroma.  Yum.They're calling this an extra fine grind.  I'd probably call it a fine grind, but it was fine enough for my espresso machine to handle it without a problem.  The Arabica beans are a medium roast.  Not too dark and not too light.  The coffee seemed to be quite fresh.  Caffeine content seemed moderate, although I haven't exactly done any lab testing.Once brewed, the hazelnut coffee aroma fills the kitchen and smells just as good as when you first opened the bag.  The taste of it is also quite good.  I've had some other flavored coffees, Gevalia comes to mind, that I thought were lousy.  In fact, I threw the Gevalia in the garbage can due to its strong artificial flavor.  But I think this is pretty decent stuff and I'll definitely use the entire bag.They call this coffee \"\"Hazelnut Creme Brulee\"\", but it tastes nothing like Creme Brulee to me.  So while the Creme Brulee tag sounds nice, it probably doesn't mean much.  However, the hazelnut flavor is enjoyable and well pronounced but not overpowering.It's very good flavored coffee, in my view.  Again, I'd rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars according to my tastes.  I think you'll enjoy it as long as you like flavored coffees.  The fact that it's ground finely enough to use in an espresso machine is an additional plus.\"", "This is a delicious, rich, highly aromatic coffee.  The hazelnut is subtle, not overwhelming.A real treat.", "Not much to say about the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.  The coffee itself was decent enough, although I thought the hazlenut flavor was a tad strong.  It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had but was decent enough for an everyday brew. That being said, I wouldn't pay $20 for this product again since I consider it no better than average.", "i had never used Melitta coffee before, so when this arrived, we were anxious to taste it and see. We generally enjoyed the flavor, but it was definitely not as good as other coffees we enjoy.", "Sorry, but I was not a big fan of this flavored coffee.  The smell was too sweet and the flavor had an artificial and bitter taste.  It was drinkable, but I think I will stick to my Starbucks.", "Bleech.That's how I'd describe this coffee.  To be fair, I'm one of those purists that grind their own beans and shy away from artificial flavors.  However, I'm open minded and gave this a try.  For a treat sometimes, a flavored coffee can curb some of those urges for a sugary treat.Opening the back I was instantly hit with the smell.  Strong and overpowering.  The smell wasn't of coffee, it was of some air freshener you'd find in a gas station checkout.  I still decided to brew it though, so I could be fair in the review.I tried it via standard drip brew, toddy, aeropress and french press.  No matter what I tried, the brew came out overly bitter.  This is partially due to the extremely fine grind.  When I tried it with creamer and/or sweetener, the brew was more tolerable.  I was still tasting the artificial flavor more than coffee accents.If you generally like the swill most companies server in their breakrooms, then this is definitely a step up.  For those of us with a bit more refined coffee palate, take a pass on this and add your own Torani syrups to achieve the hazelnut and vanilla flavoring.", "I received one 11 oz bag of Melitta coffee from the Vine program. I had requested Hazelnut Creme Brulee and that is what the shipping tag indicated. However, the coffee bag shows it to be Blanc et Noir so that is what I am reviewing. I am a morning coffee drinker and usually have one or two mugs. This blend of light and dark roasts is a fairly average coffee blend. It is somewhat heavier and darker than what I am used to having. I find it to be slightly more bitter than what I prefer. The aroma is somewhat pleasing. For a fairly inexpensive coffee it is a somewhat interesting change from my usual brand which is Gevalia. I would not use this on a regular basis but for a change of pace it offers an acceptable different experience.", "\"Although I am a \"\"one cup a day\"\" coffee drinker, I have a slight allergy to hazelnuts, so I put this coffee next to the coffee maker in our break room with a sign that said, drink up and tell me what you think. Here's what the committee came back with:J: It was really good. Very smooth and the hazelnut flavor was delicious. I like hazelnut coffee and drink it all the time and this was the best I've had.M: That coffee was very good. Me and the girls were talking and we want to have it on a regular basis. When are you going to get us some more?E: It smelled great while brewing and tasted excellent. The coffee and hazelnut flavors complement each other and make a great cup of coffee.H: I liked it. D had a cup and said, I never drink more than one cup of coffee in the morning, but just before lunch, I caught a whiff of that aroma and had to have another. It's wonderful!So, I think the public has spoken and this is a tasty, well received brand of coffee. Three of the four respondents also asked: Where did you get it? This is definitely the most popular flavor and brand of coffee in our company in the last four or five years.\"", "'Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee Ground Coffee' was delicious.  Overall it was a good dark roasted coffee.  The aroma of the grounds was nice (to me the coffee drinker and my non coffee drinking friend) and the extra fine grind was perfect.  After brewing, I found the taste to be really well done-- it wasn't too strong and the little bit of aftertaste could have been far worse!  If you're in the mood for a good flavored coffee, try Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee!", "\"I am pretty hard core when it comees to my morning cup of coffee.  A Starbucks addict, I grind my own, and prefer the more robust blends.  No cream, no sugar, just black bold coffee.  So, it was a step out of my comfort zone to try the Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.The coffee comes packaged in a foil vacuum sealed bag.  Smells delicious when you can finally get it open.  The grind is perfect for my French press, and would also work well with a coffeemaker.  I use the \"\"usual\"\" amount of coffee for brewing and the result is a smooth, if rather sweet, cup of delicious coffee.Flavor:  I can't speak to whether it tastes like real hazelnuts or creme brulee from a fine restaurant, but it definitely has the scent and flavor of other \"\"hazelnut\"\" flavored coffees.  I did not find the flavoring to be overpowering, and thought it enhanced the coffee nicely.Acidity:  A very smooth cup of coffee, which no bitterness, and no heartburn.Use:  This is a little too much for me for my morning cup of coffee.  When I'm not awake, I'm looking for my standard Starbucks.  But later in the morning, or sometimes in the afternoon, this is the perfect cup of coffee.It is possible to \"\"subscribe\"\" to this coffee, and Amazon will kindly deliver it to you on a regular basis.For those of you who like a lighter, flavored coffee, you will probably love this.  You may be able to skip your coffee additives and drink it black.  While it won't replace my regular morning brew, it has definitely found its place in my house.\"", "I'm not a coffee drinker but My Husband is a very big coffee drinker.He likes to grind his own beans, and usually is not into these types of flavored designer coffee's.That said,He was pleasently surprised. He enjoyed this coffee. It was not too sweet, and he never adds sugar or cream to his coffee.The flavor was not so strong, that it was sickening sweet. or over done so to speak.It was nicely blended for a full flavor.I have to say, the smell went all through my house, but it was not an unpleasant smell.It was a very yummy scent.We used this in our electric coffee maker, not the Melitta.It does not give any ingredient on the bag to this coffee,if any sugar has been added etc.!It does say:Extra find Grind.Hazelnut Naturally & Aritificilly flavored! (of what?)A European classic, Sweet Caramel and rich vanilla infused with the flavor of wild hazelnuts.Flavored coffee.Would We buy this again? probably not, or maybe for the Holidays or to give as a gift to bring to a someones house for dinner.", "\"My husband loves coffee and he found this product to be very good. The first thing he notice when he opened the  package is the wonderful rich coffee smell, and yes it tastes as good as it smells. He uses 7 1/2 to 8 scoops for a 12 cup pot since he like his coffee a little on the stronger side. He stated that this coffee is low on acidity, plus he has tried the Gevalia coffees, they taste good, but were too acid for people with a sensitive stomach. Once you open the can, store it in the freezer, take it out only when you need to make a pot of coffee, then put it back in the freezer and the coffee will stay almost as fresh as the day you opened the package.Though I am more of a tea drinker, I do have my share of coffee. I personally enjoy the Hazelnut features a delicate aroma. A flavor like this is perfect dessert coffee; it is a sweet reward anytime. Vanilla Almond is another flavored coffee I enjoy time to time also.Overall, it's a consistent, smooth, delicious coffee. It does not bite back at you and it doesn't \"\"challenge\"\" your palate. It stands alone (black) and holds its own when mixed with milk and sugar. If I HAD to present a criticism, it might be that the ground stuff is sort of fine which does not make it compatible with certain types of coffee makers. For us, it works wonderfully with my good old Mr. Coffee.\"", "\"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this flavored coffee. I like it both as a dessert type after dinner coffee as well as an anytime coffee. I only drink coffee sweetened (preferably with honey) and with half and half, and that is how I sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee. My coffee of choice, which I've been drinking for about 2 decades, is Peet's brand coffee (which I get shipped to me and of which I enjoy and drink several varieties, with my top favorites being French and Italian). I always buy whole beans and grind beans one cup at a time. I then make it in a filter cone, and every once in a while in a French press or an espresso machine. If I'm making coffee for 2 or 3 people, I either use the French Press or I make each cup separately, using a separate filter cone for each cup. And I'm always careful when measuring beans and ground coffee so that I can keep the flavor and body of the coffee I drink day after day consistent. (The Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is ground to an \"\"Extra Fine Grind,\"\" which means it's unsuitable for use in a French Press.)On a caffeine buzz scale, I find that Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee weaker than any variety of Peet's (or Starbucks), but that's fine with me because I don't always want or need a caffeine buzz as strong as the kind I get from a tall cup of Peet's (or Starbucks). Sometimes I regret getting a strong caffeine buzz because it leaves me feeling a tad headachey. So it's nice to know that there's a tasty, good quality alternative that is less intense on a caffeine buzz scale.I would, and probably will, buy Melitta Cafe Collection ground coffee on occasion (e.g., if I'm running low on Peet's or money to buy Peet's, or if I'm asked to bring ground coffee to a holiday gathering where it will be prepared in a coffee maker of some sort). I would like to try the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla variety, as well as their Vienna Roast (Peet's Vienna Roast was one of my favorites but they discontinued it) and Blanc et Noir (which, according to Melitta's site, is \"\"Deep with a Rich Finish\"\"). I have tried their Classique Supreme variety (and will review it separately), and like it as much as I like the Hazelnut. I received free samples of the Hazelnut Creme Brulee and the Classique Supreme for review purposes, but based on the prices listed at Melitta's site and here at Amazon I'd say that the price is right and is lower than I would've expected for coffee of this quality.Update: I spoke on the phone with a Melitta customer service representative about the difficulty I had opening both 11 oz. sample bags of their Cafe Collection coffee I received, and she said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top. I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag.\"", "I have the Creme Brulee flavor of this Melita coffee.  It brews a great cup, I did not taste any bitterness in the flavors.  I tend to use slightly less than the recommended amount when I brew a cup of java.  I make my coffee with french vanilla creamer, and the creme brulee mixed with the creamer made my cup of coffee extra sweet.  It was like dessert which I loved but may not be the preference for everyone.", "\"I am a medium to heavy coffee drinker.  I've noticed most of the heavy coffee drinkers I know do not care for \"\"flavored\"\" coffees and I must say I've had more I poured out that drank down.  That is not to say that I've not enjoyed flavored coffee when the combination of good flavor and correct strength of that flavor blend with a nice roast.  As it turns out that is exactly the case here.  If I'm going to drink flavored coffee this Melitta Cafe Collection Creme Brulee is a definate winner.The Melitta Cafe Collection Creme Brulee is medium to fine grind in coarseness.  I have used coffee with this consistency in my expresso machine, but the review here will be as prepared with a regular drip type maker.  Upon opening first thing you will notice is a very glorious creamy hazelnut smell with a nice earthy roasted coffee bean underpinning...Honestly, it smelled like a wonderful desert and as it brewed it filled the kitchen as good as any of the scented candles my wife is so fond of.  This coffee starts giving pleasure from the moment it's opened whetting your taste buds for what is to come!  Speaking of the roasted coffee itself, this is a medium roast as it is rich but not as deep as many of the dark roasts.  It is an excellent roast as the coffee is strong enough not to get lost with the other flavors, but important to me it is pretty full tasting for a medium roast yet is never the least bit bitter tasting...Excellent roasted ground beans.  Now, we're talking about flavored coffee so we must address that component, this is where I'm happy to say I am surprised.  While the hazelnut is not timid it truly strikes what to this coffee drinker is a happy balance.  It tastes just as good as the smells it elicits.  Truthfully, I'm not hung-up that it says it has artificial flavors...I only care if it tastes good and it most certainly is hazelnut with light vanilla cream taste on a really nice coffee base - eminently drinkable and very enjoyable.  If you like flavored coffee done right then this Melitta Cafe Collection flavor should be on your menu, it really is flavored coffee that even a snob purist coffee drinker could happily drink.  I will still drink more regular roasted coffee, but when I want a change for a treat this stuff will be my \"\"go-to\"\" choice.\"", "I had never tried this particular brand of coffee before and I must say, I was impressed.  To be honest, most times I don't go for the flavored coffees;  to me they tend to be a little too artificial tasting or overly powerful in aroma and weak on taste.  While this coffee is not for my everyday morning, this was a great treat to have after dinner.  I liked that it was smooth, flavorful, and not overwhelming.  It even replaced any ideas I had had about having a dessert or a snack because it was so fufilling.  My husband even wanted to try some after the smell of the coffee lingered into the living room, and he is not a coffee drinker at all.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know and I already have.", "My favorite flavored coffee with cream and sugar is hazelnut and there's nothing I found that compares to this flavor until I tried this coffee.  Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee is like a decadent dessert.The only drawback I found was that it was impossible to open the bag; you have to cut it open with a scissor.  Other than this, I highly recommend this coffee.", "I love the smell and flavor of this coffee. It's rich, indulgent and delicious. The hazelnut flavor didn't register so much with me as the caramel. That's just fine since I love caramel.", "\"Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me BruleeFirst of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the \"\"two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water\"\" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended \"\"two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water\"\" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.With the initial \"\"pure\"\" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.Next, I turned to the \"\"department-store\"\" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.\"\"Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.\"\"-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.Reviewed by BriannaFootnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review. This coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. However, I got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee.\"", "f you like the taste of hazelnut and creme brulee, this coffee combines those two tasty flavors. It is pleasantly flavored and smells delicious brewing. It is extra fine ground and doesn't seem too strong or too weak. I like to make an iced coffee drink with this: one cup of cold coffee, one and a half cups of almond milk, one-half cup lowfat milk, one teaspoon dark cocoa, stevia sweetener (a natural sweetener) to taste, ice in blender. It's about 150 calories for three cups of this tasty iced coffee mocha.", "\"I love coffee..........  I drink it daily and avoid instant, favoring mostly freshly ground beans that I grind myself.  I lean towards French and Espresso Roast and Pike Place Market, all three made by a little company up in Seattle.  After reading the product description for Melitta Cafe Collection/Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee , I had envisioned something like the sweetened Nestle's Tasters choice or something like that.  Ok, I knew this was ground coffee and not instant, but I am talking about the flavor aspect.I use a 2 cup drip coffee maker with a filter.  I followed the directions, adding 2 Teaspoons for each 6 ounces of coffee I wanted to make.  I went with 18 ounces worth which would be 6 teaspoons.  I like my coffee a bit strong so i added an extra teaspoon.  The coffee started to drip and my kitchen started smelling very nice which gave me high hopes for a very nice cup of coffee.I drink my coffee with just a dash of milk and no sugar, so I did the same with the Creme Brulee.......  What I smelled and what I tasted didn't quite match up.  The taste? In a word , \"\"Artificial\"\" ........... While the coffee itself seemed fresh enough, albeit a bit weak in the caffeine area, the 'flavor' was not what I had hoped for...  While not a bad tasting coffee, my main complain would have to be a strange aftertaste that I just do NOT wish to taste first thing in the morning, or any other time for that matter.  Your mileage may vary, but for me I think I will just stick with my plain, unadulterated freshly ground beans from that little company up in Seattle.\"", "Hey! This is good stuff. I like it!  It is tasty cold or hot.  The flavoring is subtle yet distinctive.  A perfect caffine pick-me-up. I frequently use flavored creamers but this is better.  The coffee is good quality with no bitter aftertaste.  I drank it hot with and without milk.  Both ways were tasty.  I found I didn't need sugar at all.  I also made a big glass of iced coffee, topped with whipped cream --- better than the local coffeehouse.  For my final taste test before writing this review, I tossed a strong brew in the blender with some dark chocolate ice cream.  Yum!  Ok, that's enough, I gotta go order some more of this stuff before I run out...  let's see, what else can I make ... bye!", "I don't typically drink coffee much these days as 1) it's a bit too messy at home to grind and brew and 2) I like those flavored sweeteners and sugar is on the *no* list these days. That said, I decided to get this when it showed up on Vine and brought it into the office to share with everyone and see what they thought - and the opinions were all over the board. The boss hated it, but he doesn't like the flavored stuff at all. The lads at the sales counter were thumbs up (of course, after the Folgers they usually get anything's a treat).Me, I'm kind of *meh*. I picked up on a sharp, bitter taste and while it was OK enough it didn't bowl me over. I prefer to stick with freshly ground Starbucks with a vanilla flavoring added to sweeten the pot. And since I can't have that I'll stick with my morning tea. Two stars from the boss and I, four from the lads, rounded out to three.", "I have to limit my caffeine consumption. Because I can't drink very much coffee I want the coffee I drink to be absolutely superb. A large part of my whole coffee experience is enjoying the aroma of coffee as it brews and as I inhale the steam from my cup.The extra fine grind of the MELITTA HAZELNUT CREME BRULEE package meant that I could use less than half the recommended amount of coffee and get a robust, strong brew. The flavor was so smooth I did not need sugar or sweetener to enhance it. I love the way this coffee smells. As I sit writing this review, I smell the wonderful aroma wafting from the kitchen and take small sips of the coffee from a mug that was a gift from a friend. This is civilization and comfort of the highest order.I love cream brulee. This is a great coffee that can be substituted instead of dessert, or with dessert if you must. I recommend using real cream or milk in it rather than non-dairy coffee creamer. I also recommend this coffee for breakfast as a companion to cinnamon rolls, cereal or pancakes with real maple syrup. It's great iced and would make a wonderful flavoring for homemade ice cream or milk shakes.", "I mostly enjoy bold and extra taste coffees. Among the flavored ones, I like hazelnut flavored ones better. So I expected something really good from melitta's hazelnut flavored. I have never tried one before, but I knew they make good coffees and the prices are not that cheap either.However, the taste of my first brew was not that great. It was too strong, bitter  and sour. I thought I might put too much coffee, although I knew I put right amount of coffee for my daily ritual. So I tried second time with less coffee and same amount of water. It still had this very sour after-taste with less bitterness. Finally, I tried putting more water with less coffee and now the taste was too watery. However, there was still strong sour taste left behind in my mouth. Since I am not a coffee expert, so to speak, I could not figure out what made this coffee so sour. I even checked the expiration date, but  it was still valid.After all, it took little bit of time to get used to this extra ordinary taste, yet it was not too pleasant coffee experience for me. Maybe it can be better with sugar and creme, but unfortunately, I enjoy black, nothing added coffees."], "Gamma": [0.3546185791492462, 0.35000884532928467, 0.2953725755214691], "Beta": [[0.0341014601290226, 0.03095858357846737, 0.020534437149763107, 0.028927454724907875, 0.03238750621676445, 0.03523091971874237, 0.031578704714775085, 0.029846640303730965, 0.032415300607681274, 0.031059658154845238, 0.03430882841348648, 0.03507380932569504, 0.03092511184513569, 0.03014610894024372, 0.029716553166508675, 0.02989022433757782, 0.028333548456430435, 0.031151339411735535, 0.035194166004657745, 0.02927917055785656, 0.03402390331029892, 0.03311288729310036, 0.02851724438369274, 0.03106469288468361, 0.03062148578464985, 0.03212275356054306, 0.03598848357796669, 0.03312542662024498, 0.03274140506982803, 0.023698467761278152, 0.032626546919345856, 0.03129716217517853], [0.03410951793193817, 0.031030600890517235, 0.0204908587038517, 0.028711043298244476, 0.03241089731454849, 0.03508591279387474, 0.03162559121847153, 0.02998826466500759, 0.032391976565122604, 0.03113412670791149, 0.03424132615327835, 0.034978777170181274, 0.030297739431262016, 0.030501713976264, 0.029558977112174034, 0.029991144314408302, 0.028498338535428047, 0.031275343149900436, 0.03503253310918808, 0.029182014986872673, 0.034044299274683, 0.033138394355773926, 0.0284349974244833, 0.0312502346932888, 0.03073684312403202, 0.03179547190666199, 0.035956159234046936, 0.03319709748029709, 0.03278876096010208, 0.024144526571035385, 0.0326552651822567, 0.03132127970457077], [0.03389301896095276, 0.030784916132688522, 0.022260505706071854, 0.03056015633046627, 0.032290972769260406, 0.035216618329286575, 0.03140367567539215, 0.02965567260980606, 0.03235841915011406, 0.030929194763302803, 0.03415380418300629, 0.03486233949661255, 0.030760861933231354, 0.029169593006372452, 0.029852552339434624, 0.029812084510922432, 0.028357550501823425, 0.03082454204559326, 0.035145118832588196, 0.029211262241005898, 0.03389841690659523, 0.032854314893484116, 0.029489923268556595, 0.0305497944355011, 0.030436566099524498, 0.03217378258705139, 0.03586527705192566, 0.032886069267988205, 0.0325823538005352, 0.024323198944330215, 0.03234761580824852, 0.031089870259165764]]}
