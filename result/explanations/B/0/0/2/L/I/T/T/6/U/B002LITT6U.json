I bought the SD940 to get its wider 28mm zoom.  When there are eight people around a birthday cake, 28mm is more useful than 35mm.I was very unhappy with the quality of photos from the SD940.  Flash photos had what looked like tiny bubbles in most photos.  Outdoor photos were almost always in soft focus and even-toned subjects, such as the sky, had two tiny dark circles visible in every photo.Finally, I sent the SD940 back to Canon.  Just eight days later, Canon delivered it back to me with a new lens assembly.  The SD940 can now match the high quality of my SD1000. I use the \"\"Program Mode\"\", and lock the ISO at ISO 100. I set exposure at minus 1/3 stop for more saturated colors.  I use \"\"My Colors\"\" to boost sharpness, and reduce contrast.  These settings produce photos that are excellent, but which can often by improved by using \"\"i-contrast\"\" during playback to brighten shadow areas.So, with its new lens assembly and with my taking control of focus, ISO, and exposure in the program mode, I am getting excellent photos.  However, people who use the SD940 in auto mode are likely to be unhappy with many of their photos as photos at ISO 400 and ISO 800 are sub-par.Thumbs down to Canon for selling a camera with a defective lens assembly.  Thumbs up to Canon for fixing my camera and returning it to me in just eight days, free of charge.The SD940 uses the same battery as my older SD1000.  I can bring both cameras on a trip and they can share a charger and backup batteries.  The charger is only slightly bigger than the battery, so it is easy to bring on trips.  While I am out taking photos, the extra battery can be charging back at the hotel.\"", "\"If your last camera was a stone age 3.1 MP Kodak EasyShare DX6340, then almost any camera bought today will be miles ahead. This camera needs to be compared against the current crop of cameras on the market and not an ancient kodak. Technology has really leapfrogged in the past year or two and Canon seems to be resting on its past laurels while other companies are catching up.I bought both this and the Panasonic ZS-7 recently. The ZS-7 is hands down a winner. I also note that there are other Panasonic models rated highly by consumer reports and had I known earlier, might not have bought this one.So why do I rate this model a 3 stars -To start off - the experience wasn't good. The first item shipped to me started getting ill about a month or two after I started using it. Basically, its focussing mechanism would freeze ruining many pictures and videos. Its been replaced since then and I keep my fingers crossed regarding its reliablility. I know another person who owns this camera. He hates it (I do moderately like mine). He hates it because of its very poor flash/low light performance.To sum up - there are three major cons -1) Bad flash/Low light performance2) Fragile3) Slippery to hold4) Rather short battery life if you take videos.5) Lens not as sharp as ZS-76) Rounded form factor means camera cannot stand on its edge easily - topples over. Try not to put it on a ledge and to take that self timer shot.Now the pro's relative to my ZS-71) Small Size - gives it a \"\"cool\"\" wow factor and makes you also want to own one. I think thats why I bought mine and \"\"moderately\"\" like it.2) Color is good but too vivid sometimes - makes a gray lake look blue in pics.3) HD video quality is good, but ZS-7 is better with better compression with selectable bit rate (AVCHD lite). ZS7 lens also zooms silently all the way to 16X while taking videos. Sound is way better on ZS-7.This camera is made in China. My Panasonic ZS-7 was made in Japan. My experience regarding reliabilility of high tech items out of China has been poor (Seagate drives for example - I've had 3 China made drives fail on me and the first SD-940 camera too failed).If camera size is not the most important criteria, then I'd suggest other \"\"shirtpocket\"\" size cameras.I suggest you take a look at the following - Panasonic DMC-FH20, ZS-3, ZS-7; Nikon S-8000; Canon SX210. You will get a sturdier product, better pictures and lot more bang for the buck.\"", "My wife has gotten this little camera a few years ago as a replacement for her older PowerShot point-and-shoot digital camera. It has been her primary camera for some time, and I have used it quite a bit, particularly when I don't feel like taking my much bigger Canon DSLR camera around. We've both enjoyed its features, and as long as you know what to expect you will probably be very happy with it as well.**** Image Quality ****For the longest time image quality was (more or less) synonymous with the number of megapixels, although this gauge left a lot to be desired. However, that number has not changed all that much in recent years. 12 megapixels is probably as high of a resolution as most people will ever need for their everyday purposes. The improvements have come mostly from the better sensors and image processing, but even those are more incremental than revolutionary. In other words, this PowerShot camera can definitely hold its own compared to most new point-and-shoots. It definitely has better image quality than even the most advanced cell phone camera. With various settings, you are bound to be able to optimize your photographs for most shooting conditions, although I rarely venture beyond the full automatic. The pictures can be printed even on the full-page layouts, although these days I rarely do that. If you will be primarily viewing your photos on a computer or a similar device, then the resolution and the image quality will be more than adequate, even for the Retina displays.**** Video Quality ****When it came out, the 720p was the most advanced video recording standard on the market, and was considered to be the HD recording. However, since then 1080p has become the norm. Even though 720p is still more than adequate for short home videos, if video recording is one of the main features that you are looking for in a camera then you might want to check out some of the newer models. And for everyday shooting, even the cell phone video quality on the new smartphones can be at least comparable to this camera. For the best results I definitely recommend shooting in very well lit places. You should also try to be far enough away from the camera, as it doesn't handle near-focusing too well. The IS seems to be working well even in the video mode, and this helps with the jitteriness of your video.**** Style and Build ****Traditionally these have been some of the strongest points of the PowerShot cameras, and SD940 is no exception. I really like its metallic look and feel. It gives you confidence in its durability, and it signals overall high quality of this product. The camera has been further reduced in size compared to its predecessors, and at just 120 g it's the lightest stand-alone camera that I had owned. It fits nicely into a pocket or a purse, and if portability is one of the things that you look in the camera, then you won't find anything much better than SD940.**** Conclusion ****As mentioned already, this small digital camera has served us very well for many years, and we are still not looking for an upgrade. Some of the newer cameras have more sophisticated settings and features, but if good quality of still shots is your main concern than you won't find anything on the market that will far outperform this camera. It's a very nice little product.", "\"funny to read reviews on amazon; same item, some people love it, others hate it.am surprised about the negative reviews for this camera; i've had three other canon's, this is my fave. great pictures, good options. i use it more for \"\"art\"\" shots, (see? i put that it quotes to NOT be obnoxious), so am using Vivid color, center-focusing (instead of face), and iContrast. i NEVER use the flash.am really pleased with the pictures i am taking, and the video is great too (when i use it, which is rare).great ergonomics, great size. the black version is unobtrusive. am carrying this everywhere.will enjoy this for as long as it lasts (or until a newer camera insists on being bought...)\"", "\"I wanted a camera to provide an alternative to lugging my bulky Nikon SLRs around on day trips and vacations, etc. I had a previous Sony for this purpose, but it has died and was bulkier than I wanted anyway. Realizing there are trade offs between size and quality, I opted for this Canon after doing some research.After a couple of weeks putting it to the test on several day trips and around the house, I am extremely pleased with this camera. First, it is tiny... I'm talking teeny tiny - which is perfect. Fits in a shirt pocket or pants pocket nicely and is not very heavy. Now I can have a quality camera with me all day and not have to have some bag over my shoulder or an overstuffed pocket.The camera powers up FAST! In just a couple seconds you are ready to shoot, which is great when a photo opp happens. The best setting is \"\"Auto\"\", and the camera does a nice job of focusing and exposing your shots. The quality of the images is extremely good and rivals some of my DSLRs. What I was really surprised by, and pleased with, is the HD video quality. This little camera shoots very good quality video!My complaints are few, and do not detract from my enjoyment of the camera, but just enough to prevent a five star rating:- The LCD screen is hard to see in direct daylight. I understand this is the nature of most LCD screens, but because this is the only viewing option, they need to work on improving that.- The mini-USB connection is protected by a small cover that does not open wide enough. I have to force it beyond its comfortable hinge range when inserting a slightly wider connector and am always worried I'll break it.- Once you get beyond the 4x optical zoom and move into digital zoom territory, the picture quality drops quickly. I use the digital zoom sparingly, and when I have no other choice.Overall, I am very happy with this little camera and plan to use it for years to come.\"", "\"I just received my Canon SD940IS several hours ago. I ordered it with 2-Day Service, and it came early on the second day per Amazon's usual excellent service. I have the big Nikon outfit, many lenses/bags/tripods, etc., but wanted something little, but power-packed, to take with us on a few upcoming trips. The Nikon is excellent, but would like to keep the travels simple. The SD940 is an absolute little jewel! It will replace the Canon PowerShot SD400 that I've had for years, but it was time to boost the performance (12 mp vs. 5 mp ... also 28 mm wide angle with the 940). I also love the SMALL size of this marvel. You've been reading it fits in shirt or pants pockets, better believe it! It is great in low light situations (yup, tested it), and the LCD worked perfectly in the bright sun. I took a bunch of test pics, they are perfect. I also love the WIDE format Canon offers in the picture menu selections. An added benefit for me is that is uses the same batteries and case that the SD400 used, so now I have three spares. As someone mentioned in a prior review: the \"\"big\"\" cameras have their role and place, but having a small, highly portable, dynamo in your pocket means you will be ready to take all sorts of shots you very well might have missed. I would absolutely recommend the reader check this camera out!\"", "I bought this Camera in may of 2010, it is now Dec 2011 an I am still loving this camera! It doesn't have the fastest shutter speed, so some of the action photo's will be blurry, but it is small and will be there when you need it. It does excellent video, however the time limit is capped at 10 minutes. Even if you have a 32GB card in it. I have yet to find a way to change this setting and I have looked.The view screen is nice and big the auto setting is my go to setting. Macro takes nice photo's for Ebay. The auto timer is easy to use as are most settings. I do have trouble figuring out how to change the color setting of the Black and white plus. This is where the whole photo will be black and white except for a single color of your choice. Mine is currently stuck on green until I look up how to change it again.I have defiantly put this camera through a lot of physical abuse and it is still going strong. The original battery still has plenty of power, but I always carry spares. The paint around the lens is all chipped away but that is just cosmetic. The lens still functions like day one. Right out of the box I put a screen protector on the back and have never taken it off. The screen protector is very worn, I need to replace it but the screen underneath is pristine. I always recommend a protector go on out of the box.I am sure the price has come down on these since I bought it and that would make it an even better buy today!"], "Gamma": [0.5, 0.5], "Beta": [[0.003892152803018689, 0.0077392663806676865, 0.05739589408040047, 0.3156720697879791, 0.004312129225581884, 0.1335618495941162, 0.477426677942276], [0.003892152803018689, 0.0077392663806676865, 0.05739589408040047, 0.3156720697879791, 0.004312129225581884, 0.1335618495941162, 0.477426677942276]]}
