Would recommend to anyone!", "I really like these brushes. They are good quality for a good price. I'm like a hoarder of makeup brushes too. I can never have enough, so I'm always out there looking for great new brands, or new styles that I haven't tried yet. I really like these. They get the job done. :D", "I love the quality of these brushes. This kit has every brush you could need, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned make up pro.", "24 different brushes for 16 dollars is amazing! its cheap then e.l.f! plus Shany are members of PETA( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) something I always look for before buying a product!", "for the price these are, its and AMAZING set! it comes with so many varieties and i can do so much with these!", "These brushes are another great product from Shany.  I love to have an abundance of brushes, so when I can find a set of brushes with quality such as these for such an amazing price, I snatch them up!  Great buy!", "This is a deal in so many ways! If i had tried to 24 of MAC's Brushes it would cost me about 130 or more!", "the brushes are all good and different sizes, soft and flufy and has an amazing foldable case for easy storage", "ALL SHANY COSMETICS BRUSHES ARE GREAT IN QUALITY!! THEY ARE BETTER THAN SOME HIGH END BRUSHES!! I HAVE SO MANY MAKEUP BRUSH SETS FROM THIS COMPANY AND THEY ARE ALL GREAT!!", "These brushes are amazing...as are all of SHANY's brushes! These are super soft and there is virtually every brush you could ever need/want!! No shedding which is huge when you want good results!!", "This set of brushes is the best set ever!!! It rivals the most expensive set out there. Great quality and excellent finishes for any makeup user!! A must have set!!", "The brushes arrived on time and were as described.  These brushes are FANTASTIC!  I got these and couldn't believe how great they are.  They are natural hair, and hold the make excellently. These work as well or better than a set I have that I paid more for.  I am very impressed with they quality of these brushes,  I recommend them to anyone.  I use brushes for applying my makeup, and find this brush set the be excellent. If you want to try brushes fro makeup application this is an excellent set too try.  I plan to order a couple more for gifts for my daughters. Linda W", "There are so many great things about these brushes! I love the fact that I don't have to hurry to clean one if I switch colors there are just so many different ones that I can use and it gets the job done that's the most important part!", "Decided that I wanted to purchase this brush set, as well. You can never have too many brushes - right !? Especially at these prices. I must say, Shany Cosmetics has done it again. A stylish brush set that works great and creates beautiful makeup looks for a great price?! This is the product that gets it done! Buy them! You won't be disappointed.", "What i like most about this product is that it is cheap and their quality is great. Comparing from those branded brushes, the price for this you could only get like 1 brush but instead you're getting 24 brushes.", "I love these brushes! so pretty all black and the case is black also! black goes with everything! So many brushes to use! and the price is so unbeatable! You just have to buy them!", "\"I love, love, love! these brushes. I had purchased the Shany 13-piece brush set last year and couldn't get enough of them - literally! Which is why I bought these. I wanted to compare this \"\"studio\"\" set to the \"\"professional\"\" set.. and I also wanted a wider variety of brushes. These brushes are soft and sturdy. They pick up a good amount of pigment without caking it on. This set includes basic brushes and also what I call \"\"special\"\" brushes (for the brush-freaks like me) that most people don't use every day. The only problem I had with a few of the brushes is that with heavy use occasionally a hair will come out, but hopefully that won't happen often.\"", "I just started beauty school and I did not want to spend a lot of money on Mac or any other expensive brushes. I have ordered from shany before and never had a problem and the same goes for these brushes. I have no complaints, the work great and I saved money .", "I couldn't afford MAC  brushes but buying these were worth the money, I ordered this set for my older sister in beauty school.

I have a problem with awkward fitting brushes in my hand but this is perfect.", "I needed new brushes and I was a bit skeptical at first to buy brushes sight unseen but I decided to take a chance. I was glad I did. These are quality brushes with long handles in a pouch that is real leather. I love the case because it rolls up the brushes securely in a soft pouch that can be put in your suitcase like a roll of socks. The brushes themselves are made of quality animal hair and do not shed like other brushes do. I love the fan brush for my touch off of mineral veil as I use bare minerals makeup. I have bought quite a few brushes from the best of make up salons and these are the best yet. Everything they say about them is true and the best of all they are priced way below what they are worth. If I had bought these in a department store they would have cost me 5 times as much or more for the whole set. YOU will not be disappointed. Thanks Amazon for one great deal!", "They feel so soft and nice, great value, all the brushes you need! I recommend getting these brushes they are really good and i love this set!", "These brushes are a great quality.

You can find a purpose for every brush. I'm not one to splurge on brushes, especially on MAC or Sigma, yet this brush set does the job. I enjoy the fan brush to apply a highlight on my upper cheeks and the shadow brushes fit perfectly on my eyelids so  I apply the perfect amount of eyeshadow without overdoing it.", "Finally an affordable brush set with all the brushes that I want/need.  The pouch keeps these separate from my other brushes.  Love!", "Another great stylish brush case with so many brushes for all your needs. They are so soft.The price is so right and inexpensive for such quality.", "I am in the process of enlarging my makeup collection, so i wanted to get a rather large brush set.
