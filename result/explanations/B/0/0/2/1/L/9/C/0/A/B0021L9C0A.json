The Magellan 1440 is one of the bette units available, and it is very fairly priced.In my view, there are certain features that a GPS should have, and this is how the Magellan answers the need for those features:Big screen, easy to use touchscreen:  The Magellan is 4.3 inches and has VERY easy to use data entry, both because of the sensitive touch screen and the predicative data entry (anticipates what you are typing)Sensible Routing:  I have another unit with great features, but an annoying habit of telling me to get off a highway and get right back on to the same road!  The Magellan has consistently given me the best directions of any unit I have used.Loud Volume:  Often overlooked, but you need to HEAR the unit giving directions.  Again, the Magellan is quite vocal (in a good way!).Sturdy windshield mount:  Other units I have constantly fall off the windshield, creating anything from a minor annoyance to a sharp missle in the car.  The Magellan did not once fall.Clear speaking voice:  Here the Magellan falls short.  Many other GPS units have recorded speach, while the Magellan has a synthesized voice (meaning that it sounds like a computer from a 1970s movie).Clear spoken directions:  Big problem.  Other units will say, \"\"In 500 feet, take the ramp right\"\".  The Magellan will say, \"\"In 500 feet, drive slightly to the right\"\".  Annoying to me.Ability to put in European maps:  Not available (at least from what I could tell).All in all, the Magellan is a good basic unit with a big, easy to use screen and a LOUD voice.  It is a good value.\"", "\"# Why this rating?This device does everything that a GPS unit should, and it does it well. In many respects this blows my Garmin 660 out of the water.It's audio is loud and clear, it has a bright LCD, has tons of advanced features (name assist, multiple way points, lane guidance, etc.), and a built in AAA database.However, there are some minor annoyances with the user interface, and it occasionally gets confused.As a result, I rated this at 4.5 stars (\"\"I *almost* Love It!\"\"), and rounded up.Here are the details of my review:#-#-# The Good #-#-#1. City and Street Name Assists (SmartCity and QuickSpell in \"\"Marketing-speak\"\")This is by far my *favorite* feature!For the most common cases, I simply begin typing my city without having to pick a state, and the device has an uncanny ability to zero in on the city I'm thinking of. It does this by using my current location as well as my driving habits. Likewise, it helps in picking street addresses by hiding characters on the keyboard that do not apply.(This can be a big deal for drivers who regularly cross state lines.)2. The voice prompts are clear and well articulated.Even complex phrases such as \"\"Exit 7B, County Road 34, Normandale Blvd\"\" were enunciated without any trouble.3. Lane HelpI used to believe this was a marketing gimmick until I tried it out for myself. The lane graphics come on about a mile away, providing enough time to maneuver appropriately. I would have loved to have had this on a recent trip to LA, where I was constantly challenged by lane positioning while mired in heavy traffic.4. Find ParkingWhen you arrive at a destination, a discreet button becomes available that lets you locate the nearest parking ramps. This is a huge help in downtown driving. (This actually is one of those ideas that you wonder how you got along without.)5. Zoom on TurnsI positively hated this feature, until I figured out that it can be turned off!!! Its odd to rate this negative as a positive, but I see the ability to turn it off as excellent usability engineering. Good work, Magellan!Note you can also turn off the highway assist icons if you so choose.6. Multiple waypoint supportWow! You can add additional waypoints, sort them, and optimize your travel. The only thing missing is what Mappoint lets you do - set constraints around each stop, such as the time you expect to spend at a location, or the time at which you need to be at a waypoint.7. Highway Exit POIsHow often have you scanned the list of services available at an exit, looking for relief from full bladders or empty stomachs? Well, the \"\"Exit POI\"\" feature shows you an icon that lets you route to the nearest gas station, diner, or hotel from a freeway exit.8. Panning the mapThis is the smoothest I've seen - it works even better than Google Maps :)9. Routing ChoicesThe choices for Fastest time, Least distance, Least use of freeways, etc. are easily accessible (with one click), with ETAs clearly displayed for each choice.10. Traffic notificationThis is available as an accessory - you need to purchase a vehicle adapter with a built in traffic receiver. It comes with a lifetime subscription (but the adapter does cost about half what this device does). In addition, traffic information is only available for select cities.#-#-# The Not So Good #-#-#1. Unnecessary KeystrokesWhile driving I want to minimize the number of times I touch the screen. However, this device requires that after you make selections you must press a really tiny ENTER button. Even changing the volume needs the pressing of this button.2. The distance to the next turn was simply too small for me. Its in a really small font at the top left. I found that annoyingly difficult to pay attention to. I much prefer the Nuvi's large display at the bottom right. On the Magellan, this space is given up to a static button for the \"\"Menu\"\". IMHO, a questionable design decision.3. The lowest unit is 0.1 mile - so I don't get the same granularity of guidance as with the Garmin - which measures down to feet.4. The maps are inconsistent. It doesn't show a gas station (on the corner of 494W and Lake Rd) that's been there for over a decade; but it does pick up a new roundabout in Woodbury!5. Gets confused sometimes. Recommended I take a longer route a couple of times, even though the map showed that it clearly knew about the shorter path.6. There isn't an equivalent for the Trip Information page on the Nuvi, which provides an at-a-glance readout of a ton of information.7. Not quite the breadth of language options, male/female voices, or accents, as the Nuvi. (There's only English, Spanish, and French here.)# Updated July 04:When angled directly into sunlight, the family consensus was that the Nuvi 660's LCD was a tiny bit more readable than the 1440.The 1440 does not display speed limits for roads. That's a feature I've grown to rely on with the 660, so it's sorely missed.Happy Driving!\"", "If you are looking for a solid GPS which can get you around unfamiliar areas and to unfamiliar destinations, and without any non-navigation bells and whistles (such as Bluetooth, mp3 player, etc.), the Magellan RoadMate 1440 will get the job done for you.  BUT if you are looking for a GPS to help you find shortcuts around your common routes or to help get you out of traffic jams, then this GPS is not suitable.  And of course, if you are looking for bells and whistles like bluetooth and mp3s, then hit the back button on your browser now.When I turn on the GPS unit, it does take about 15 seconds to boot up.  Once that is done, the interface is pretty easy-to-use and understandable.  The touch screen is not too sensitive, yet does not require one to press too hard to make an input.  The Magellan has almost NO delay in picking up the GPS signal.I tested the Magellan out as I went on a routine trip around town.  Finding destinations was easy, as you can search either by category or by name.  I had no troubles getting to where I wanted to go, as in the GPS would get me exactly to point B and not some other place 500 feet away.  The lane guidance feature is also pretty nifty and I was amazed that all the signs shown on the display were identical to the real thing, down to the exit number!  There have been a lot of changes to the roads here in my area due to recent construction, and it seems the maps are updated to reflect these changes.  I was pleased about that.Where I wasn't happy with the Magellan was its choice of routes.  The GPS loved taking me on main roads that tend to be clogged with traffic.  I noted how it would want me to take a left turn that I typically avoid because it is not a protected left turn and the oncoming traffic makes the turn almost impossible to make.  Also, I could not find an instant reroute button that I could hit if I were to get stuck in traffic or a closed road and wanted out.Overall, the Magellan 1440 is a GPS that I wouldn't mind having when I am visiting a friend's new house or on vacation in a new city.  But I am going to have to continue to rely on my senses to find ways out of traffic.", "My husband got me this GPS for Xmas. He did a lot of research and decided on this one based on the more Points of Interest and the independent Consumer Reports reviews. We are very happy with it, tested it on a Tennessee - Oklahoma trip, it worked great! I also tested in in town, going to airport in one state over, great results, many options to choose from, and we love the lane assist function, it is very helpful! Highly recommend it!", "This little machine, like most, has some interesting features and some less interesting drawbacks. The breadth of knowledge and the battery were two strong positives. Its inability to find home after taking a slight roadwork detour was pretty troubling. And I'm not sure which category The Voice fits into yet.I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge the machine displayed about local Points of Interest and Local Info. I live in a small tourist town, with a winter population of 1000, which was described pretty accurately. (Apparently I live in a &#34;picturesque small town overflowing with nostalgic charm.&#34;) It gave a lot of exact information and phone numbers about local gas stations, restaurants (24 within 10 miles), and nightlife (20 within 10 miles). I also found ATMs, airports, camping sites (as if), motels, grocery stores, emergency services. Some information, for Marinas, was way off and incorrect, and there were some anomalies that required local knowledge. (One restaurant in particular, a town favorite, should be listed under Health Department favorites.) It knew boat cruises and tours but not dune rides --? However, this device has a lot of pretty good information available. I checked for info of towns in Canada and Puetro Rico, and that was also accurate.This device has a good strong battery. It took very little charging to make it stay on for a while, demonstrating a much stronger battery life than my Garmin nuvi 660 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator ever had. When fully charged over a couple of hours of driving, they have approximately the same amount of battery life. After a short twenty-five minute charge though, the Nuvi gave up within five minutes while the Magellan stayed on for over an hour and a half.The Voice (and there are precious few other ways to think of it) coming out of this device is a little alarming at first. It warns you three times before you need to turn, starting when you are a half-mile away. But I did like that the speaker is in the system and I didn't have to find an empty FM channel to play it through. Living near two cities means that channels are sometimes empty and sometimes not. The Magellan speaks loudly and clearly. I think in the end, that it is a benefit that it has a good speaker.But with the good also came the bad. The Magellan couldn't find its way home when I turned when it wasn't expecting me to. We are having serious road work, causing both sides of my street to be shut down and to get home now requires driving down into the town where I live and then up the hill and around the high school.The other problem was that when it was operating in my car, side by side with a Garmin nuvi, the maps were far less detailed. The display was the same size but the picture quality was not. It had a tendency to only show things on the street I was driving on rather than the nearby points of interest that the nuvi knows about.A variety of problems typing in data: I had some difficulty typing in the small city near my own because it automatically starts filling in names and it does not acknowledge the possibility of the city named Holland in Michigan. It thinks that Holland is Hollandale or Holland Landing, or Holland Centre, or Holland Town of... It took awhile, too long, to override the presets. And it seemed like there were too many steps to put in addresses.This unit had problems right out of the box. Then it had more troubles from its Tech support. Bad combination. I contacted Magellan and it took 3 days for them to get back to me to ask me what my question was. Yes, I did send my original request on a Friday morning and they replied Monday at 11:59 am. It was not a holiday weekend. That's a long time in the world of instant information.The other problem this particular unit has is that it thinks it is in San Dimas, CA, and it wants to go to the Burger King. I have not persuaded it otherwise.", "\"Let me state up front that I'm very happy with this product. I've got some experience with the Garmins and I find the difference between the models to be very minimal so I think you'll be happy with either one. That being said let me review the areas I believe are important in any GPS.Satellite Acquisition: The Magellan acquired a satellite within a minute or 2 each time I tested it. Once acquired, the signal was never lost. I've found the Garmin acquisition time to be slightly faster but the time difference is not enough to worry about.Setup: The Magellan was very easy to setup. I actually had my wife go through the setup without using the manual to see how easy it was to follow since she's not really technically inclined. She got through the process very quickly, with the only mistake being the time zone selection. We're in Arizona which doesn't recognize DST so that's always a little tricky for us. For 99% of America, this shouldn't be a problem.Regular use: We had very few issues using the software built into the Magellan. It was pretty straight-forward with only an occasional wrong button pushed. Again, we purposely did not use the manual to test ease of use so we probably would have had zero problems with the manual by our side.Effectiveness: The maps, directions, mileage and time calculations, and gas station locations were spot on every time. We also purposely veered off course on several occasions and the unit recalculated the routes quickly and accurately.Graphics: Large, colorful, and easy to follow. Very similar to Garmin. The one thing about the Magellan I didn't like is that the map zoomed in and out depending on where we were on the route. Not sure about the algorithm used here as we found that aspect a little annoying. We would prefer the zoom to stay at the same level unless we manually changed it.Speech: The speech used was clear and smooth. We found it to be a little more natural than the Garmin but again we're splitting hairs. The Magellan also spoke up more frequently than the Garmin, speaking our selections as we entered City, Street, Number, etc. I actually liked this aspect.  What I didn't like was how the Magellan treated minor route deviations.  It described a bend in the road and a fork in the road as a \"\"slight turn to the right\"\". If we weren't familiar with the route this verbiage could have confused us to the point of actually thinking we might have to turn right, which would have put us off course.Accessories: Included with the GPS unit are a power plug that plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter and a mounting frame that sticks to your windshield. Have to be careful here because the windshield mounts are illegal in some states.  I recommend considering a \"\"bean bag\"\" type mount that just sits on your dash and is kept in place by it's weight. I also would like to see, as standard accessories, a carrying case, an A/C charging plug, and a screen cleaning cloth. I believe these should be standard because you want to keep the screen as safe from smudging and scratching as possible. The A/C charger should be standard because the GPS can be used as a carry along when you're not driving but still need directions. Having to find a car to recharge it in this case is a decided inconvenience.Recommendation: I have no reservations in recommending this unit. It is extremely handy not only for trips to unfamiliar cities but also for unfamiliar parts of town if you happen to live in a fairly large city. Having tried to read directions and maps while driving at the same time I can tell you that these gadgets are a godsend.  They remove all the stress of worrying about getting lost once you learn to trust them.\"", "Although I'm usually an early adopter of new technology, I'm relatively new to the world of GPS navigators. I got my first GPS Navigator a little less than a year ago. It's a Panasonic, so not one of the big name brands (i.e. Garmin or Magellan). The Magellan RoadMate is considerably thinner and lighter than my Panasonic. While I've been quite happy with the Panasonic, I wanted something a little more portable. The RoadMate 1440 fits easily into my pocket. I've been using the 1440 for the past two weeks on trips in Michigan and Florida. I really like the accuracy of the RoadMate. It gives ample warning time before a turn. It seemingly picks the best route all the time. On my current family trip to Orlando the RoadMate 1440 has helped easily get to all of the major attractions which are all in memory. I only have a minor issue with the 1440. The position of the USB adaptor port is in an inconvenient position making it difficult to remove when pulling the unit from its bracket. However this is only a very minor problem. I can highly recommend the Magellan RoadMate 1440.", "\"After briefly using my brother-in-law's Magellan 1400 while on a trip to eastern Florida I fell in love with it. For the trip back home I bought a Magellan 1440 and had the most relaxing ride 250 mile road trip home ever. Magellan's interface is beautiful and instantly easy to learn. It's easy to program in destinations, and the unit instantly recalculates if you've missed a turn. My wife and I noticed that it makes driving in unfamiliar areas completely stress-free. It was amazing how relaxed I felt when I wasn't constantly worried if I was on the right street or highway, or if I'd missed a turn and was driving miles out of my way.The Points of Interest is where the Magellan really shines. I needed gas as I was running low. Quickly switching to the POI screen I found a gas station right on our exit to another freeway. No more worrying about whether there's a gas station up ahead or not. Need coffee for a long trip? It's right there. The AAA database of POI is amazing, and can save you money if you're a member.I tried a brand new Garmin 1390T with tons of features--but I hated the interface! The Magellan programmers have really thought of what drivers need and have made it easy to find what you're looking for. The Garmin is OK but I found myself getting quite frustrated with lots and lots of clicks to find POI's.The Magellan is superb and accurate. Its screen is bright and easy to read in daylight, and automatically adjusts for night driving. The 4.3\"\" screen is large and easy to read. The lane change assist is very helpful on confusing freeway interchanges.The latest software update makes the unit very fast, with sufficient time to get in the correct lane for turns. A very nice feature is a bell/gong that rings immediately before you should turn. There are different-sounding bongs for left turns, right turns and u-turns. Garmins don't have this at all and I really missed it. I bought a Garmin 1390 and it arrived today but it's going back to Amazon in favor of the Magellan 1440, which is more than $100 cheaper and an absolute joy to use.Four things to note:1) It's Windows-updatable only. No Mac updating is possible unless you can boot into Windows via Bootcamp, VMware Fusion or Parallels. I use Fusion on my Mac Pro and it was a breeze to get the latest updates via USB download.2) The Text to Speech voice is female and is a bit brusk, sometimes sounding like a drill sergeant. This isn't a big deal but should be noted.3) The 1440 works in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, with optional updates for Mexico. You cannot buy updates for Europe with this unit.4) If you need Traffic information, get the 1445T.\"", "I bought two of these last month, one for myself, and one for my son.  We both like it a lot. It was his first, and my third, counting one built in to one of my cars.  I had a Garmin Nuvi 760 for quite a while, and got rid of it.  The Garmin was OK, but not worth the high price.  The other is in a 2005 Lexus, and basically sucks as far as usability goes.This unit basically does everything I need, and does it easily.  It is not really any better or worse than others I've used.  I like the one-touch shortcuts, the ease of switching from 2D to 3D mode, and the ability to choose between ETA, Time Remaining, Miles Remaining, Time, etc.  I mostly use the ETA, which seems pretty accurate so far.I've noticed a couple of minor annoyances.  When entering addresses, it will sometimes pronounce but not register an entry, so you have to pay attention to what is actually entered rather than what it says is entered.  I think there is no excuse for this type of error, and it definitely should be fixed.  It's simple programming, and whoever did it should be fired, at the very least.  I mean, how hard is it to record the entry before pronouncing it?Another problem is with the freeway assist.  On my route home, there is a split in the freeway right before my exit; you must take the left fork, then the exit soon after, on the right.  If I have the navigation on, it directs me to take the right fork instead of the left (very clearly).  If the navigation is off, it shows the correct lanes for each.  So, this makes me lose confidence in this feature, although it only seems to happen for this one instance.  I guess it gets confused by the exit coming up, although the exit does not have its own lane.The satellite reception is a little better than the Garmin, it seems.  The Garmin will not work in my house, but this will, at least somewhat.  I had them together for a while, so I could test them under the same conditions.I like that it will operate and charge off my Motorola cell phone charger - I have several of these; it also works off the Garmin's charger, although the Garmin would not work on the Motorola charger (it went into USB mode).I updated both the firmware and the map right after I got it; there seems to be a bug in their software if you try to do two updates together - it just sat there for hours on the 2nd one, saying not to disconnect it.  I did, and reconnecting it did the update right away.  This happened for both mine and my son's.Next week, I'll be driving from SF to Seattle, so I'll see how it works for a long trip.", "\"I have owned many GPS units... Garmin, TomTom, Navigon.  While there is no perfect GPS that I have come across, this one has many great features...and some issues.The unit takes forever to start up. And even though the GPS indicator shows a strong signal, the unit is still \"\"acquiring a signal.\"\" Go figure.  This has repeatedly happened to me under an open sky.  Wait, wait, wait ....What I liked....Love the screen. Very nice colors and crisp text.Thin design.Great easy to see street names and the POI's are easy to spot. Especially the ones that are branded.Lane Assist is great. I like it better than TomTom, Garmin or Navigon.The windshield mount was easy to put on and stayed on after.The AAA tour guide was absolutely the best.Finding POIs was a snap. Easier than TomTom or Navigon. But about on par with GarminThings I didn't like....The charging cable mounts right under the unit AFTER you mount it to the windshield mount. Very, very awkward and hit or miss.When you search for POIs you don't get the address, just the name. You have to click on it to see the address. The Maestro 4350/4370 (I own the 4370 also) shows the address which makes it a lot easier to identify.Traffic was useless. I live in the greater Washington, DC area, and this unit (with optional lifetime traffic cable) couldn't get a traffic station signal.  The 4370 easily did.Start up and getting a signal is always a problem.The unit has gone 'crazy' more than once. Clear sky, major road and it thought I was a mile away. Once it showed me 30 feet off road on the school field I was passing.Conclusions...The user interface and screen are the best I have seen. When the unit works, it does a good job. Most of the time, it's hit or miss. The graphics are great, the size is great, the routing so-so, the POIs great, the AAA Tour Book absolutely the best. I really wanted this to be the one. But sad to say, it doesn't seem to measure up to all my needs.\"", "My initial impressions of the Magellan RoadMate 1440 were pretty good.  The packaging, instructions, and ease of initial use were all top notch.  Overall, I feel this would be a good unit for a GPS newbie or someone that does not want all of the bells and whistles.  For those seeking more, you might want to go elsewhere.After digging in and using the 1440 on the road, I found the build quality to be lacking.  It feels cheap in the hand and for this price point, I expect more.  The charging connector and stand connectors are somewhat delicate and I fear they would break easily if dropped or thrown into a travel bag or vehicle compartment.Without even reading the instructions you can begin using the device, so it is easy to operate.  I found that you had to actually click through more menus and windows though to get the information you want.  Garmin's interface tends to be cleaner and more accessible.  I want to see all travel information (ETA, Mileage, etc) on one screen.  I do not want to continue hitting a button while I'm driving in order to see all of the data.  I had trouble finding some options, but that could be because I'm used to the interface of other manufacturers.The voice instructions were very clear, in fact one of the most clearly spoken systems I've heard.  Road names were much more clear than my previous Garmin.  The screen, however, is difficult to read when in sunlight.  Even after making adjustments I just could not get it just right.  Also, with no audio output you will not be able to hook this up to your car speakers.  The volume was clear and loud though, so that might not be an issue for you.I found the system to be very peppy, but it took a little while to find POI that you hand typed.  You also had to get the spelling very close to the actual POI, otherwise it would not find any results.  GPS signal lock came fairly quick and you could get going on your way in little or no time at all.  Point to point directions were good for the most part, although some items and roads were outdated even with an upgrade to the system.If you are a first time GPS user or someone that wants to enter the market at this price point, then the 1440 might be a good match for you.  If you have used other GPS devices and enjoy certain features that other devices might offer, then you might want to look elsewhere.", "I have several GPS as we have several cars and I hate to constantly take out of one car and put in next. This is a great machine. I love the talking advantage over the others, it helps to know when and exactly where you are turning. This little machine does it all. It s great. If you want to get somewhere and get there fast and without difficulty and around the town one or more times this is the machine for you.", "The Magellan 1440 is a 4.3 inch GPS unit equipped with maps of North America.  I have a previous Magellan GPS unit and found this to be an improvement in several key ways as detailed below:Pros:1.  The 4.3 inch screen does not sound like a significant upgrade  from a 3.5 inch, but it is like going from a standard definition TV to a HD television system.  It is a noticeable difference.  Graphics are nice, and you get pop-ups showing the correct freeway ramps to take, plus the unit zooms in on tricky freeway intersections and the like. Nice feature.2. Set-up:  I found this to be quite easy and straightforward.  In fact, all I did was power up the unit and let it find a satellite location.  This does take a few minutes, so don't expect directions in moments.  However, after the first satellite location, it only takes mere seconds for subsequent location finding.  Power is scant, so you will need to power up the unit with either the included power cord for the car, or the USB cord.3. The unit itself is about the width of your thumbnail, which is pretty small.  A speaker is located in the back, with the USB cord on the bottom.4. The holder which is included is far better constructed than my previous model.  It feels more secure and stable, and the hook-up to the unit is a slide-in slot on the back rather than the previous holder which was like hands.  (let me note I didn't have problems with that holder, but this feels more secure).5.  One touch is a feature that takes you to the things you would probably want beyond directions such as your route home, points of interest, gas and battery power and satellite strength.  It is very easy to locate and works well when driving.6. Points of interest include AAA listings and are fairly good.  Some locations will be out of date, but overall you can find the things you need most.  It has helped me locate things like a gas station when low on gas!7. Ease of use:  it is straightforward and easy to use.  Easy to punch in a location and have the GPS locate you a route.8. Brightness seems fine in broad daylight.  A driver may want to go to system features and turn off the battery saving feature which seems to make things dimmer at all times.9. Traffic feature:  for a pretty low price, you can buy a power adapter which allows you to receive traffic updates for your unit.  This is (considering the price) a great feature.Neutral:1.  Location of USB port:  my previous model had the USB port located on the left side which was terrible because I then a cord running invariably underneath and behind the unit to the power plug.  This model makes an improvement by locating the port underneath.  I do wish the unit had been oriented other way so that you don't have to scrunch the cord to run it the other direction (is this for a British car because no American model has power located on the left side of the driver, and most drivers will place the item near the center.2. Spoken languages:  Not much choice here, just English, French and Spanish.3. No capacity I am aware of to add voices or sounds off the internet.4. There is a micro-SD slot, I have no idea what to use it for since it is not explained anywhere. Map updates of some sort?  Nothing is noted anywhere that would tell the user what the purpose of having this is.Cons:1. Quite honestly, I have not encountered any real problems or issues.2. If you must have features such as Bluetooth, or voice dialing, this does not have those features.3. On/Off button:  My previous unit had a button you had to press and hold down for a few moments before start-up.  This unit has a sliding on/off button.  Frankly, after some use, the button is an annoyance.  Not a major issue, but I don't like this button!4. Can't tell my location:  actually no, that isn't true! - I can tell my present location, but compared to my previous Magellan here is the difference - I had a digital compass with an altimeter.  Neat stuff when driving across the Mojave desert or Imperial Valley below sea level.  I can't find this feature anymore on this unit and greatly wish it was there because it was cool.  Definitely not pleased with this. Knowing your position relative to a compass was a nice feature.  Knowing your altitude was a bonus.  Why was this taken out?Overall, I find this unit to be a simple and reliable source of driving information.  It has many features relative to the price.  It is easy to use, and uncomplicated.  Having only used Magellan GPS units, I cannot comment on other models such as Tom-Tom or Garmin (they have some cool commercials though), but I believe a buyer cannot go wrong with this unit if you're looking for an easy and basic GPS unit.  Overall, I am quite pleased.  I do not believe a user will be disappointed in the slightest with this unit.May I also recommend this friction mount:HDFMB-2: i.Trek V2 Open Front Heavy Duty Friction Mount Base for Garmin, TomTom, Magellan GPS Devices", "I purchased the Magellan RoadMate 1440 4.3 Portable GPS and got it at a good price.  This is exactly what I ordered and it works well.  I am pleased with the product.", "After having used 6 or 7 other GPS units  (Garmin Nuvi 680 and 255, two in dash GPS units in Cadillac cars and couple of units in rental cars) I find this Magellan Roadmate1440 to be slightly above average performer. The nicest thing about this GPS is QuickSpell: you begin entering the first few alphabets of the name of a city or street and it will complete the rest. Like others in Roadmate series, it has built in abbreviated AAA TourBook, which gives you the names, phone numbers and star ratings of restaurants, hotels etc. and attractions. But the AAA TourBook feature does not work well and has a software glitch: no matter what my locations was, the AAA Tour Book kept showing restaurants near the first location I had looked up. It requires software upgrade.Here is my take on this unit.PROS:Nice user-friendly interfaceQuickSpell is very useful and timesaverSharp screen graphics with good night time displayText-to-Speech, speaks the street namesProgramming is quickShows the distance to and direction of next turn by arrowHighway lane assist feature is very helpfulYou can program to display custom icons on map, like parking, gas etc.Has multi destination routingsWindshield mount is secure and better than NuviCan program shortcut icons for frequently used destinationsWorks reasonably well as a GPS unitMini USB charger at the bottomTraffic link service is an extra option and I have not tested itCONS:Daytime colors in shades of green do not have good contrast, especially compared to Garmin NuviDaytime display is faded to the point of being invisible in bright sunlightSlow - sometimes the turn bell rings after you have made the turnTakes a while to pick up satellite signal, perhaps somewhat slower than NuviIn downtown with tall buildings it can lose the GPS signal (happened to me in San Francisco)Does not give the speed limit like many Nuvi unitsFinding remaining battery takes 3 clicksSometimes locks up and keeps rebooting after you put an addressPurpose of micro SD slot unclearIn my experience the useful features in a GPS unit are clear display, ease of programming, speed in acquiring satellites and giving directions, spoken street names, speed limit display and traffic. Bluetooth, FM transmitter, ability to display pictures and play music etc. are frivolous features that you will hardly ever use and make the unit a lot more complicated to use. Dedicated Bluetooth speakers from BlueAnt, Parrot & Motorola work much better. Magellan makes a myriad of GPS units in Maestro and Roadmate series and all Roadmate Magellan units have QuickSpell and AAA Tour Book and as far as I can make out, the unique feature of Magellan Roadmate 1440 is 4.3 inch screen size. Although QuickSpell and AAA Tour Book features are nice, I would still prefer Garmin Nuvi to Magellan because of great day and night time display and slightly better performance as a GPS unit.UPDATE (February 2010): Every time I put in a new address, the GPS would reboot. From Magellan's web site I downloaded the firmware2.20 which actually bricked the GPS! But Magellan customer service replaced the unit within a week. Excellent customer service from Magellan - which is exceptional these days.UPDATE (April 2010): The new unit worked only one time. Now it is hung up on the start screen with a spinning circle! Very bad software and extremely poor reliability. I would advise you staying away from it.UPDATE (May 28, 2010): Magellan replaced the second unit and so far the software firmware 2.22 appears to be stable, at least after 10 uses. Their customer service is excellent.", "\"The Magellan 1440 is a very good looking GPS unit - I've used Magellan units in the past, and they have generally been rock solid. The 1440 is no different. All the important things are there - text to speech, a good POI database and accurate routing.I took the unit for a couple of test drives, and each time it routed very efficiently and was able to do route recalculations in about 8 seconds - fast enough to tell me how to fix my route.The user interface is fairly well designed, and everything is where you'd expect it to me. Finding options is simple, and unlike other brands (lie TomTom), nothing is hidden away behind 10 pages of menus.The Magellan 1440 does lack something - innovation. I hate to say it, because I like the company, but there really isn't anything in the 1440 that makes it stand out in the busy GPS unit marketplace. Garmin has additional applications, TomTom has stupid celebrity voices and Bluetooth, but the 1440 is just too simple for today's GPS market.Then again, if you just want simple, then this might be what you need, I'm just of the opinion that you need to offer something special if you want to grab the attention of someone looking for a navigation device.Lane assist is a standard feature on most brands nowadays, and text to speech is a \"\"must have\"\".That said - the hardware is good, the interface is reliable, and it excels at the one thing you need in a GPS unit - navigation. The screen is also above average, and certainly better than what you'll find on one of those $70 GPS units.The AAA guide is a nice touch, but I found a lot of the information to be outdated and incorrect.All in all I'd give the unit itself a 5/5 but its value for money a 4/5. I just wish it had more to offer.\"", "\"This Magellan GPS is not a bad GPS. Indeed, for someone who has never used a GPS before, this might be a pleasant experience. But for the past two or three years, I have used a Garmin GPS. And compared to the Garmin, the Magellan is an exercise in frustration.Let's just start from the beginning.Satellite connection:This thing took an inordinate amount of time to connect to the satellite signals when I first started it up. I don't know if this is because it was searching the entire world for the correct satellites, or what, but all the Garmin GPS devices I have used ask you to input your initial position manually, probably so that it doesn't have to go searching the entire sky to figure out which satellites to use and where you are. It took so long to connect, in fact, that I thought I had received a faulty unit.On subsequent startups, the connection was much quicker, but still not as fast as my two-year-old Garmin.Entering addresses:Typing in your destination address is a bad experience. Why? Well, as you type each letter, the Magellan tries to figure out which street you are talking about. This is fine, but as soon as it figures out -- or thinks it figures out -- what street you probably mean, it jumps to a screen of street name suggestions. This would be fine if it paused briefly before accepting new input. But it doesn't, and so fast typists like me will inevitably choose a street or city without seeing what we have selected, because we are still typing the name. Then you have to go back and start again.In comparison, the Garmin throws in a slight one second delay before allowing you to choose the intended street name from its list of suggestions. This prevents any accidental input.Navigation:Okay, this is a big one. The Magellan's navigation algorithms are, for want of a better word, funky. I had the machine set to give me the fastest, rather than the shortest, route. However, its alleged fastest route is almost never the actual fastest route. This is a huge problem, essentially negating one of the main benefits of a GPS. I know how to get to a lot of places around town in a roundabout way, but presumably a GPS is able to calculate the most direct route. However, as I entered in destinations into the Magellan, I was shocked and annoyed to find that its fastest route was always several minutes longer than the Garmin's fastest route. (For comparison's sake, I was often using the Magellan and the Garmin at the same time.)The Garmin always knew what it was doing. When I entered in an address across town, the Garmin usually told me to take the freeway (specifically, I 66), and would give me its estimated time of arrival. The Magellan, however, wanted me to take an odd, non-freeway route, with an estimated time of arrival of several minutes longer than the Garmin's calculation. I double-checked the Magellan's settings to make sure that freeways were enabled, and indeed they were. For some reason, the Magellan simply wasn't using them. When I decided to take the Garmin's advice, the Magellan eventually recalculated the route, and now that it was on the freeway, it gave me an updated time of arrival -- several minutes shorter than its original so-called fastest time.The Magellan's fastest time calculations are simply wrong. I know this not just from my experimental observations, but also because it has a neat feature where you can see a screen listing the estimated time of arrival using its various different navigation settings: fastest time, shortest route, etc. Frequently, it's \"\"fastest time\"\" was actually longer than the rest of the navigation options. This makes absolutely no sense and is indicative of a bug in the navigation algorithms.Voice guidance:Had I never used a Garmin GPS, I would have thought the Magellan's voice guidance was perfectly adequate. However, with the Magellan and the Garmin sitting next to each other, both trying to explain what to do next, the differences -- and the shortcomings of the Magellan -- were obvious. The Magellan's computerized voice was stilted, and nowhere as natural sounding as the Garmin. The Magellan would say something like, \"\"Right Turn, Point Five Miles, Harrison Street.\"\" The Garmin would say, \"\"In Point Five Miles, Turn Right on Harrison Street.\"\"Voice guidance on freeways was even worse, a crying shame considering the high speeds at which one drives on the freeway. You should not have to use any brainpower to decipher what the GPS is trying to tell you, and yet the Magellan required some concentration and decoding. It would bombard you with various route and exit numbers, giving you far more information than you need to take the next exit, and rattling off that information without natural pauses. It was frustrating.Freeway navigation theoretically should have been made more pleasing than the Garmin by the addition of Magellan's interesting sounding Exit Sign Technology. This feature allows you to display the various green freeway signs on the screen of your Magellan, highlighting the sign that you want to follow. This is supposed to be easier than just listening to the voice telling you which exit to take. But it really just adds confusion, as I have to stare at the different reproduced signs, (which are not actual pictures of the real highway signs, by the way, but just generic green highway signs that usually look nothing like the real signs), and try to figure out what it wants me to do. Again, this just requires more brainpower and makes it more likely that I will get confused at 80 mph and miss an exit.And the Magellan's timing was off. Timing on a GPS is a very subtle, yet important feature. The GPS has to be able to tell you when to turn at different times depending on what speed you are going, how far ahead the turn is, whether you're going to need to switch lanes quickly to make the turn, etc. Garmin's programmers got this right; Magellan's didn't. Again, this is something that I might not even have realized had I only been using the Magellan, and had I never used a Garmin. But, having had a successful GPS experience for years, the deficiencies in the Magellan's voice and timing algorithms were evident.Display:The navigation display colors are horrible. I don't know if the Magellan engineers had never used any other GPS devices, or did not focus group their display, but the colors they chose to delineate roads and routes are completely nonsensical. During the day, in order to indicate the routes to take, the Magellan highlights your suggested roads in a light yellowish green line, which is displayed over a slightly darker yellowish green background. At night, the color scheme is not much better. Now, my eyes are fine. I am in my late 20s and I can generally see things on a LCD monitor with no problem, and yet I had trouble seeing which roads were actually highlighted.The Garmin gets this right. It overlays a bright pink line against a gray background during the day, and a dark blue background at night. This is much easier to see. There are never any questions over whether or not a road is actually highlighted. I always know where I'm supposed to go.It is really ironic that the Magellan, which has an amazingly clear and bright LCD screen, would be so inferior in this area to my old clunky Garmin with its faded screen. But because of the questionable choice of colors, the Garmin crushes it.Does the Magellan have any pros?Sure. As I said, it has a beautiful screen. It is generally a fast machine (except for connecting to the satellite, sometimes). Its navigation interface, although cluttered, gives you quicker one touch access to destinations than the Garmin does. This is handy when on the highway, for instance -- it takes two taps to see the list of nearest gas stations (Where to, Gas), compared to four taps on the Garmin (Menu, Where to, Food/Fuel/Etc., Gas Stations). The Garmin is less cluttered, but it takes longer to wade through its many submenus. Finally, the Magellan's standard closing phrase (\"\"You have ARRIVED!\"\") sounds far cooler than the Garmin's ho-hum \"\"Now arriving.\"\"Bottom line:My two-year-old Garmin GPS is a far superior device to this brand-new Magellan. Had I never known the Garmin, I would be satisfied with the Magellan. But I know what a GPS device is capable of. I simply cannot use the Magellan because it is incredibly frustrating and gets a lot of things, most notably navigation calculations, very wrong.My advice? Look at Amazon's list of best selling GPS devices. The crowd is rarely wrong, and in this case the crowd and I both agree: If you want to get somewhere, Garmin is the way to go.\"", "I've used both the Magellan 1440 and 1470 and have the same opinion about both:  The feature set Magellan offers is superb, but Magellan needs to improve reliability and performance.  I gave the 1470 4 stars, but that was before I encountered some of the reliability issues.I've owned and used 2008/2009 models made by Tom-Tom, Garmin and Magellan.  Garmin rules the market, but they don't offer the best feature set.  I found the Garmin to be rock solid in terms of performance, but extremely limited in functionality and very difficult to adapt to one's personal needs.  If all you need is to go from point A to point B then Garmin is probably what you want.  If you want your GPS to do more, well, maybe put up with the quirks of Tom-Tom or Magellan.OK, the 1440: As others have noted, the feature set is identical to the 1470 except the screen size.  There are a few other minor differences, but it basically comes down to the screen.  If you'd like the bigger screen then consider the 1470.  It's as basic as that.The Magellan GPS units shine when it comes to POI (points of interest) adaptability.  Within a minute you can find the nearest Target store, nearest library, town hall, etc. because the units have all that information included and easily organized.  Magellan beat the pants of both my Tom-Tom and Garmin in this regard.  Ditto the AAA guidebook function.  This is a unit that really works with you when it's not just about getting somewhere, but also just figuring out where you want to go in the first place.Unfortunately, Magellan GPS units suffer from reliability problems.  I've experienced a single system failure (restart required), map shifting top to bottom/bottom to top at unexpected moments, and the map showing I'm 50 feet in the woods instead of the paved road.  This last problem is not about the maps needing updating -this problem has popped up all over the place in cities and rural areas on new roads and old roads.  I've restarted the unit and it will immediately show me back on the road.I realize this might scare people off from buying a Magellan.  However, if you can work around the quirks and you need a GPS unit to go beyond just getting you from A to B you should give the 1440 or other current Magellan a look.  I've found that I actually prefer using the Magellan over my Tom-Tom and I wouldn't go back to my previous Garmin which I sold after using for a couple of weeks.  Until Magellan, Tom-Tom, Garmin or another company comes along offering both reliability and functionality I'm going to stick with the 1470 as I prefer the larger screen size."], "Gamma": [0.1666649729013443, 0.16666623950004578, 0.16666623950004578, 0.16666752099990845, 0.16666752099990845, 0.16666752099990845], "Beta": [[0.0016461157938465476, 0.0661986917257309, 0.242653951048851, 0.19294068217277527, 7.383836054941639e-05, 0.02023221366107464, 0.04613058641552925, 0.00819801352918148, 7.69059406593442e-05, 6.951835530344397e-05, 0.00010854272113647312, 0.20455065369606018, 0.000135740774567239, 0.18358735740184784, 8.188632637029514e-05, 0.0007015563896857202, 0.03243164345622063, 0.00018216809257864952], [0.0016461146296933293, 0.0661986768245697, 0.24265389144420624, 0.19294069707393646, 7.383834599750116e-05, 0.02023220621049404, 0.046130530536174774, 0.008198011666536331, 7.69059915910475e-05, 6.951834075152874e-05, 0.00010854309948626906, 0.20455065369606018, 0.00013574061449617147, 0.18358741700649261, 8.188618812710047e-05, 0.0007015562150627375, 0.03243161737918854, 0.0001821686455514282], [0.0016461147461086512, 0.0661986842751503, 0.24265392124652863, 0.19294065237045288, 7.383835327345878e-05, 0.020232202485203743, 0.04613054171204567, 0.008198012597858906, 7.690599886700511e-05, 6.951834802748635e-05, 0.00010854311403818429, 0.20455068349838257, 0.0001357406290480867, 0.18358737230300903, 8.188623905880377e-05, 0.0007015562732703984, 0.032431621104478836, 0.00018216858734376729], [0.0016461147461086512, 0.0661986842751503, 0.24265392124652863, 0.19294071197509766, 7.383835327345878e-05, 0.020232191309332848, 0.046130482107400894, 0.008198010735213757, 7.690607890253887e-05, 6.951822433620691e-05, 0.00010854341962840408, 0.20455068349838257, 0.00013574049808084965, 0.1835874319076538, 8.188608626369387e-05, 0.0007015556329861283, 0.03243160992860794, 0.00018216919852420688], [0.0016461147461086512, 0.0661986842751503, 0.24265392124652863, 0.19294071197509766, 7.383835327345878e-05, 0.020232191309332848, 0.046130482107400894, 0.008198010735213757, 7.690607890253887e-05, 6.951822433620691e-05, 0.00010854341962840408, 0.20455068349838257, 0.00013574049808084965, 0.1835874319076538, 8.188608626369387e-05, 0.0007015556329861283, 0.03243160992860794, 0.00018216919852420688], [0.0016461147461086512, 0.0661986842751503, 0.24265392124652863, 0.19294071197509766, 7.383835327345878e-05, 0.020232191309332848, 0.046130482107400894, 0.008198010735213757, 7.690607890253887e-05, 6.951822433620691e-05, 0.00010854341962840408, 0.20455068349838257, 0.00013574049808084965, 0.1835874319076538, 8.188608626369387e-05, 0.0007015556329861283, 0.03243160992860794, 0.00018216919852420688]]}
