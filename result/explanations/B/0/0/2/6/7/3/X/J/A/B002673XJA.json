Trek and an MMO really seem like the perfect marriage, if you think about it.  There's a whole galaxy of content and 40+ years worth of stories to draw on.  This game was really a no-brainer.  Or so one would think.I had the opportunity to play in Open Beta, through the Head Start, and now I'm about a week into release.  So, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for close to a month.  I play games a lot, and I have played nothing but this game since beta, and I think I've got a pretty good handle on most of what it offers, so I feel like I have more than enough information to write an informed review.I bet if you were to ask any Trek fan who had never heard of this game (hypothetically) what a Star Trek MMO would be like, you would get a huge amount of great, creative, fun ideas for a truly massive game that encompasses the vast and noble feeling of Star Trek.The one thing a Trek fan would NOT tell you is that they would expect ANYTHING like what this game is.What Cryptic has done here is taken all the 40+ years of lore, all the potential for a massive and engaging game, all the many varied aspects of Star Trek, and they distilled it to a very, very simplistic space shooter that feels about as massive as a shoebox.All that talk of diplomacy from the TV series?  Forget it.  This is Trek for the ADD crowd.  It's all phasers and photon torpedoes.  It's all out war all the time, and you won't stop until every ship in every system is reduced to a pile of floating debris.Exploring the galaxy?  Seeking out new worlds and new civilizations?  Hardly.  The galaxy is represented by the \"\"sector map\"\" which is a ridiculous looking neon grid where you'll see your ship, and the ships of other players, floating around heading for various neon icons of planetary systems. Notice I said \"\"planetary systems\"\" and not \"\"solar systems?\"\"  That's because they only bothered to make one planet for each system.. and with very few exceptions, you can't even go to that one planet unless you've been told to go there by your Starfleet contacts.  And when you DO get to beam down to a planet?  Each planet consists of a tiny patch of land with nothing but the objectives for the one mission that allows you to go there.  I'm talking very very small here.  I think the largest one I've seen so far was an indoor environment about a quarter of the size of an old Doom level.  You scan your five \"\"whatevers\"\", vaporize a few dozen baddies with a ground combat system that's as bland and boring as they come, beam back up to the ship and then do it all over again in another \"\"system\"\"  Wash, rinse, repeat.One more thing that needs to be mentioned about the \"\"Sector Space\"\" is that each sector is divided into several \"\"blocks\"\" of systems, and in order to get to the next block, you have to go through a loading screen.  Not only that, but each block is divided into a bunch of \"\"instances\"\", to keep the server from overloading.  What this means is that, when you go to Earth Spacedock for example, 20 of you will go in to Earth instance A, 20 of you will go into Earth instance B, and so on.  So, not only do you not get the feeling of a massive galaxy to explore, but you also don't even get to see everyone who's there!  Just 20 random people.  Even if you are in a group with your buddies and go to Earth, you will almost certainly not end up in the same instance.This causes the game to suffer in a number of ways.  They have a few space stations set up here and there, like Earth spacedock, Deep Space Nine, etc.. and they are clearly meant to serve as social spaces.  They have a bar and an observation lounge.. heck.. at DS9 you can even go to Quark's, but there's nothing to do, nobody there, and as a result, nobody socializes.  Quark's (which is itself a seperate instance from DS9) is always totally devoid of human players.  It's depressing to walk around these places and notice how empty they feel.So.. the majority of your time, you're going to be floating on the neon grid of Sector Space, flying towards your next boring shoot-em-up mission that's just a reskin of the last one you did, and most of the time, you'll be doing it all by yourself.To be fair, they do have what they call \"\"exploration missions.\"\"  What that means is that you're directed to another block of the Sector Space grid.  Only, instead of seeing icons of planet systems in the distance, you'll see a pink haze and the same blue grid, with the occasional \"\"anomaly\"\" for you to scan.  This will sometimes take you to a random mission in an \"\"unexplored system\"\".  But, you'll quickly find that these missions are just like the others, and you'll often be doing the exact same one two or three times in a row as you go from anomaly to anomaly.All of this exploration stuff takes place in a block smaller than any of the other blocks, and you'll usually see another 15 or 20 people there waiting for these \"\"anomalies\"\" to spawn.  When they do, it's a race to get to them, because once a system has been explored, it disappears and pops back up in another spot at another time.  Imagine floating in a blue boxed grid with pink fog with 20 other people waiting for these systems to appear.  That's what they call exploration in this game.  Where no one has gone before?  Indeed not.So.. with all that negativity out of the way, there are some things that I DO like about Star Trek Online.  Mainly the space combat.  The best part of this game to me is that, as you work your way through the ranks from Lieutenant to Admiral, you will get to control more and more powerful ships at each step.  The ships can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons and stat enhancing consoles which you will also upgrade along the way.  You also get to commission Bridge Officers, who each bring different abilities to the table.  In your first ship, you are allowed to have one Tactical Bridge officer, one Engineering officer, and one Science officer.  At first, only one of their abilities will be available to you in space.  You may have a Tactical officer with the \"\"High Yield Torpedo\"\" ability, which allows you to fire 2 torpedoes instead of the usual one, or a Science officer with a \"\"Sensor Jam\"\" which will remove the enemy's ability to target you for a short time.The way you can mix and match your weapons, equipment, and Bridge Officers is very well done.  It's obvious that this is where Cryptic spent most of their development time, and I think most players will at least agree that the space combat is fun.  It starts off very easy, but as your level increases, your combat options and the enemy difficulty increase quite a bit.  Taking down 3 Romulan Birds of Prey with nothing but your quick fingers and wits, escaping by the skin of your teeth.. it's really quite awesome.. and as out of place as it feels to be constantly blowing up ships in a Trek MMO, you never really get tired of it.So, to sum up.. this is an extremely unfinished game.  It's very light on content right now, does not feel anything like an MMO, and needs a HELL of a lot of work before it should even be considered as a serious contender to the other MMOs on the market.  That said, I want and hope to see the game grow, so I have decided to subscribe for a few months and see how it goes.Is it worth it for you?  Well, all I can say is read these reviews, watch some gameplay videos, and read up on Cryptic's plans for expanding the game.  If you believe they will make good on their promise to make this game better, then give it a shot.  It's going to be the only Star Trek MMO that we have for quite a while.\"", "\"Like many, I've really been looking forward to an MMO that breaks both the typical 'fantasy' genre or better yet linear progression structure of many MMO's out there, and while there was much hype to this game and it does have it's shining moments, at this early stage I feel it will be forgettable in a matter of time.One of the main problems STO faces is the challenge that lives up to the hype and IP franchise of promising to be 'The' Star Trek game.  Gene had a vision of creative solutions and thinking outside the box while introducing people to cooperative factions and exploration.  Well, unfortunately at this point the game thus far is reduced to one core component: combat.  While one may argue that all games must have a combat element (and I agree), in this new ST outing, Gene would be very disappointed to learn that the Federation is asked to shoot first, ask questions later.As other reviews have stated, the majority (note: not all) of missions are go to X and kill Y.  Or collect Z and report.  Perhaps it is too much these days for developers to flex a bit more creative muscle and come up with more than the traditional and tired mission types that are no different from all the MMO's before it.  I for one was really hoping to do more 'diplomacy', 'exploration', and 'scientific'-like missions, but in the end, there jsut isn't that feeling.Being that it is Cryptic and NCSoft, and having played CoH/CoV for 5 years myself, I still can't help but feel that this is a slightly more enhanced version and re-skinned version of those games.  Right down to the font type, crafting and auction elements, these are VERY similar to CoH/CoV.  Although I will give NCSoft/Cryptic credit...they do support CoH/CoV with numerous expansions so one can assume that they will also support STO for years to come.Not to sound totally negative, there are some bright spots: 1) Character creation is very deep and I haven't seen any other game close to the amount of detail one can let loose not only on their main toon, but their supporting toons as well.  2) Ship battles are fun and add a nice touch of strategy to them while keeping an eye on various weapons, shields, and ship systems.  3) Space graphics are more advanced than previous Cryptic/NC games which is nice, but still a bit behind others.  4) Sound effects are dead on.  5) There appears to be a lot of unique modifications one can make to your ship over time not just in look but buffs and devices as well.  5) Open instances can be fun if you get the right mix of players all vying for the same goal.Now a few tarnishes:  1) It just doesn't live up to the 'feel' of Star Trek which may detract from my pre-release expectations.  2) Ground/Away-team combat and missions needs work.  Animations and collision detection seem 'off', and already so early in the game I notice all these 'strange' new worlds and civilization are already repeating tile sets...(here's hoping that the devs will flesh this out later).  Same goes for the missions.  After you do a few of them (they are fun the first time around), they all seem to repeat their objectives yet again.  3) Chat channels are abysmal....here's to hoping they may support 'Vent' or other 'audio' based ones in the future.  Dare I say \"\"Barren's Chat\"\" (all you WoW players will know) can be easier to follow at times.  4) Some ship elements like 'scan' are very shallow and are one trick ponies at this point.  There is a lot of rinse and repeat type missions and exploration is questionable.Reading all this is not to say this is a bad game.  I played the Beta and now the final, and I suspect there is much more content to come.  Perhaps wait a few months before you pick this up to see what the dev's have in the pipeline.  If you never played CoH/CoV or Champions Online, you'll probably get much more kick out of this than I am so far, but if you have, then you'll quickly note the same formula/feel and think you've played this before, it just has a Star Trek 'overlay' to it.\"", "\"I think I made a big mistake applying for the lifetime subscription.  Nevertheless, as you note from my fun rating, I am stuck with the game, and fully devoted to it.Nevertheless, in case anyone from Cryptic Studios Star Trek Online department happens to read this and identify who I am in the game, if they are petty enough to try to punish me in-game for my comments, I defend myself by saying I will remain loyal to this game not merely out of monetary commitment, but because it is still fun.I have never played an MMORPG before.  I tried World of Warcraft for a few minutes, but never bought in.And so, because of my pre-order bonus, I got to play the beta of this game, and all throughout the beta, I sincerely hoped that this was merely the beta version and the final release would be vastly improved.No.  It's not.  The beta was about as complete a game as you'll get.  The only changes I noticed were constant changes to the user interface and style of the cursor and buttons.The bad:- Graphics are horribly out of date.  An MMORPG like this extending to casual gamers cannot have Modern Warfare 2 or Mass Effect graphics, lest it alienate those without Alienware (Oh God, stupid pun!).  Even so, the graphics are something that would be top of the line in 2004 or 2005.- Character customization is deep, with many options, but some odd exclusions are sincerely annoying, such as an inability to adjust cheekbones, meaning you can shape or deform the head any way you want, but you'll STILL have jutting cheekbones.  As well, there are boring choices for hair, colors are heavily muted for eyes, skin, and hair, meaning you can't have bold colored aliens.- Almost no variety at all in quests, which make up about 80% of the total gameplay.  I guess the term they use is \"\"grind\"\".  The grinding in this game is annoying to a huge degree.  You're forced to play a stale tutorial as soon as you start up involving wandering around a ship, killing Borg drones almost insultingly easily, all on your own sometimes, then beaming down to a planet and killing more Borg drones to save colonists.  Then your captain arbitrarily dies, meaning YOU get to command a ship despite you being a mere Lieutenant.And this is the exact same startup for EVERY Federation character, even if you make more than one.  Then you can acquire missions from various commanders, Admirals, etcetera, and they are NOT randomized---the \"\"Patrol X Sector\"\" or \"\"Stop the Signal\"\" missions you get with your first character you will get with your next character, etcetera and so on.And almost every mission involves war.  They really bring to mind that unfortunate realization by Picard in \"\"Insurrection\"\", where he remarked \"\"Remember when we used to be explorers?\"\"  Maybe it's justified here since the story is that the Klingons have been manipulated into going to war with the Federation (Those Klingons have always been so easy to manipulate after TOS) plus the war with the Romulan remnants, and occasional Borg shenanigans.And yet even these missions are preferable to some of the absolute worst---the ones where you do nothing at all.  One of the worst offenders was one on a Federation colony where the workers are close to mutiny.  They're dissatisfied and want change (YES WE CAN!).  Your mission is... to \"\"talk\"\" to them, then report all this to Starfleet.  You don't even need to read what they say, just find them, click \"\"Talk\"\", then find someone else and do the same.  And I do mean FIND because they are inexplicable scattered across a small area of the map, with no radar indications as to where they are.You just talk to them, talk to Starfleet, and your mission is complete.  That was the absolute worst mission I have experienced in this game.But really, the missions are boring and grinding, and you only get a choice of three minor ships to start your career, after which you must advance TEN levels in order to reach the next rank and get a newer ship.  So learn to love your Wrath of Khan USS Reliant-style ship.- Ground combat isn't boring, but it sure isn't fun.  It's probably one of the few times in an RPG where, not pressed for time or sick of playing repetitive levels, I have actively sought to NOT fight as many enemies as possible.  This is simply because it's just too boring---enemy AI usually consists of the drones attacking your officers, while some random arses just charge at you and start shooting you from 2 feet away.  At least, this has been Klingon strategy ad nauseum.  And Phasers somehow lost their disintigration powers, as it can take nearly a dozen Phaser lances to kill an average Klingon grunt.Even worse, there seems to be a perpetual lag in ground combat, even when you're all alone in an isolated location.  Sometimes, if you try to attack enemies with punches and kicks and such, you'll be seen striking them, only for them to be knocked back a half-second later.  Sometimes if you bash an enemy with your rifle to knock them over, nothing will happen to them.  Sometimes if you attack an enemy with a long-range bolt from behind, they will stand there for a full two seconds before suddenly keeling over.They tried to make the ground combat live-fire live action combat (unlike KOTOR), and it ends up feeling turn-based anyway due solely to this inexplicable delay in hit processing.  What's even worse is you can't even fire shots from rifles or phasers repeatedly---there's a cooloff period for them which is your deathknell in situations where you are faced with a dozen enemies and your bridge officers are engaged with other enemies.- For a space game taking place in space, space is wholly uninteresting and painfully small.  There's a very sharp sense of isolation, even, in which system maps are completely separate areas from sector maps.That is, when you go to the Solar system, you are not only centered entirely around Earth orbit, but you cannot contact people NOT in the area, and you cannot interact with them.  When you want to warp out, you go into this huge \"\"Sector\"\" map which is completely unrealistic and a huge and jarring snap out of immersion, as a space-like environment suddenly becomes a big blue room with stupid-looking icons representing planetary systems, and huge blue lines connecting them via trade lanes.  And major sector blocks are separated from each other, so you feel like you're in a room, with other sector names painted on the walls.For a very good example, this is almost exactly like the Family Guy episode \"\"Road to Rhode Island\"\" where Brian and Stewie escape from the Pope on a hot air balloon, then see the world below them and marvel at how it looks exactly like it does on maps, with the countries literally labeled with their names and such.Space travel is in no way realistic, and you literally CAN travel the entire galaxy in less than an hour.  This is great for a video game with intentions at luring in casual gamers, but it does horrors for realism and for Star Trek fans, especially fans of Voyager, who would be sickened to learn that a 70 year voyage from the Delta Quadrant to Earth would likely take 12 minutes in this game at Warp 7.But then, the good:- You can curse.  I know it sounds stupid, but provided you uncheck the \"\"filter profanity\"\" in the chat options, you can curse all you want.  It's very liberating.- Space combat.  I was heavily disappointed at the failure to fully exploit 3D space combat and a sticking to the idea of \"\"Space is an Ocean\"\"---I would have loved to fly straight \"\"down\"\" and find a Klingon fleet seemingly \"\"upside down\"\" from my position.  Instead, your ships cannot fly straight up or down, but can come very close.Regardless, space combat has a VERY heavy maritime feel, as you can move swiftly, yet slowly, to a target, and open fire upon them with different weapons in different places, pulling broadside attacks, or exploiting \"\"three-dimensional warfare\"\" as best you can in a \"\"Wrath of Khan\"\" style of attacking someone from above or below.Even though I catch myself constantly feeling disappointed by the highly monotonous action of space combat, consisting of slow turns and nonstop clicking of the fire buttons, this never gets old or boring for me.  At least, not yet.  Joining a Fleet and communicating and coordinating with them makes this an even greater experience.The best comparison I can give is Freelancer.  In Freelancer (and depending on the mods you use) space essentially IS an Ocean---if you turn upside down, your ship will inexplicably turn rightside up again.  You can execute U-turns in space up and down, but there's really no reason to.  Space combat is a highly face-to-face affair where you will spend more than 70% of the time just turning around to face an enemy and fire at them with forward-firing weapons.  It's an unpleasant experience all around.Here, although you move a lot slower, it's incredibly more satisfying to spew lasers on enemies, in the hopes of just denting their shields, or slowly turning about in order to broadside an enemy from above while an ally strikes them from below, or experiencing the VERY REAL danger of a mortally wounded enemy ship about to explode, and you having to flee the area, as it explodes, and does damage to your shields and hull if you're too close.A frequent MMORPG player would find this game an insult, a shoddy and tawdry creation, with any and all redeeming features either insignificant, or up to future patches and development.This is my first MMORPG, and I plan on sticking with it.Any and all questions, I'll answer immediately in the comments section\"", "Customizing ships:  First off, you can only choose between three ship styles for each class of vessel.  Invariably, all ships will always look pretty much the same with only miniscule details that are different.Ships:  Cruisers are way too slow and turn like a train off its tracks.  Escorts seem to be the best option for this game, as about 70% of the missions I've done have all been space missions, and it's important to have a good ship.  I haven't played my Science vessel at all.Missions:  This game would be better if the missions didn't seem like they were the repeated over and over, with different planet models and asteroid changes.Crafting:  I've never been a fan of crafting, so it doesn't really hurt my feelings that there isn't an extensive crafting system.....MMO?:  It's an MMO, trust me... There are instanced missions that are solo (or don't auto-join you to groups), there are instanced missions that have open grouping, and there are instanced missions that make it seem more like an MMO (tons of people working together towards a common goal).  It's refreshing to see an MMO that doesn't require you to play amongst other players all the time, because a lot of MMO players are (expletive deleted).Leveling:  You have to gain 10 sub ranks in your current rank, plus spend a certain amount of training points to be promoted to the next rank.  IE, you need to be a Lieutenent 10 and spend 6700 skill points to get to Lt Commander 1, which would be the same as Lieutenant 11 if you hadn't gotten promoted to Lt Commander.Pros:  Playing in the Star Trek Universe as a captain of your own ship.  Away team missions with bots (your bridge officers).  You can block and report game currency sellers at the same time.  Free ship when you get to each Rank.Cons:  Server seems to go down just about every day, for at least 2 hours each time. Every space fight is a Kobiashi Maru, where you'll be outnumbered by 2-8 Ships.  No matter how many Tactical officers with the taunt skill you have, your character will automatically be ganged up on if you use AOE attacks.  Personal shields get drained in two to three shots, and you can get one shot by named encounters.", "After playing the game for two weeks I have just had it with the extreme repititive nature as well as the excessive amount of instancing in the game. The game is fun for maybe 2-3 days but after that the reality begins to sink in that the game is just the same old standard mmo fare of destroy X amounts of ships, than kill Y amount of bad guys on ground or a ship corridor and/or scan Z number of items. This pattern repeats over and over with the same kind of setup in space or a really small instance on the ground. The space combat instances all look the same, the ground maps are really small instances(surrounded by invisible walls) devoid of any life except the bad guys, few small buildings and maybe plants. And to top it off every mission you do involves 4-5 load screens which really gets annoying and dont really give you the feeling of a huge persistent world. The battle-ground style pvp I found fun and is in my view well-done but thats about it and I dont think it merit me paying a monthly sub for the game.I will like to re-emphasize that the missions are highly repititive and are all killing and more killing which might be some alternate version of star trek as even DS9 which was a heavy war-oriented trek series had its fair shair of episodes just on exploration or diplomacy or social issues.The only aspect to look forward in this mmo is getting a new shiny ship every new tier and than rinse and repeat the same kind of missions over and over with only the mobs spieces or the space-ships or the battle scenery changing for the next 10 levels till you hit the lvl cap. There is no real exploration or diplomacy or social issues interplay in the game to atleast what we saw in the star trek tv series or universe.Anyways I will not be playing after my free 30 days expire and will promptly proceed to uninstall this insult to the Star Trek universe from my computer.", "\"I really enjoy MMOs, but the ones I'm playing right now have grown stale, and being a trekkie I definitely looked forward to this game.  After playing it though, I am very very disappointed.Where do I start?  Lets start where the rubber meets the road: the gameplay.  It's awful.  Controlling the ships is an exercise in frustration, and the battles are really lackluster.  They seemingly drag on forever at a very leisurely pace.  On the ground, things are even worse.  Again very counter-intuitive controls and slow boring battles.The other area that sorely disappoints me is the \"\"Star Trek\"\"-iness of the game.  They really failed miserably to capture the whole \"\"what it would be like to be in that universe thing\"\".  I created an Engineer, but immediately the game had me treating people in the medical bay, conversing with aliens on the bridge, and a half hour into the game I was already piloting my own ship.  In other words, there was no sense at all that I was like \"\"Scotty\"\".  I simply had some \"\"bonuses\"\" to repair things *rolls eyes*.  It was very clear to me that they simply lazily plugged the tired old \"\"DPS, Tank, Healer, Mezzer\"\" forumula into this game, and gave it a new \"\"skin\"\".The other disappointing thing was the graphics and sound.  The graphics definitely remind me of games 10 years ago or more.  Although the graphics are rendered in a more modern resolution (filling up my big monitor and not looking stretched), they simply look bad, like they were done by strictly second rate artists.  The same goes for the sounds/music only more so.  Compared to other existing MMO's, the poor audio for this game is a bit shocking.All in all, I see no reason to play this game (so I no longer do).  Poor gameplay, they failed to capture the feel of the Star Trek universe and characters, and artistically this game is a mess.\"", "\"I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years now, and the first thing I think of when I think of Star Trek Online is... \"\"Where's the Trek?!\"\" It certainly doesn't feel very much like Star Trek, even if it looks like it. Some have even complained about the proliferate non-canon ships at end-game, but that is neither here nor there. The excuse of war is used to make a game that is all about shooting something and destroying it. There is no real diplomacy, there is no real discovery. Fly in, shoot it up, then warp out. Even in times of war that is not the policy of the Federation. I don't think Captain Picard, Sisko, or Janeway would intentionally blow up a base that houses Jem'Hadar babies. In Star Trek Online -- you will.Warp is another reason this doesn't feel like Star Trek. You warp around at impulse speeds in the \"\"Sector Map\"\". This is nothing more than an attempt to make the game feel larger by increasing travel time... but in the end it only succeeds at reminding you just how small the game is. Space has been sliced up, and placed into small neatly-packed instances... complete with border walls (remember the plasma walls in City of Heroes... well, take away the plasma and put a sign up instead that says \"\"next zone over is *zone name*\"\"). The other problem with sector space, and the fundamental design of the entire game, is it adds more load screens. Let's say you're starting out at Earth (Sol) Space Dock, and you have a mission to head to a planet in the Regulus Sector Block to investigate a situation: first you leave the station (load screen), then you warp to sector space (load screen), then you spend 5-15 minutes flying through sector space to the Regulus border (load screen), then you spend another 5 or so minutes flying to the system that houses the planet you need (load screen), then you finally warp in to, usually, only see one planet... and proceed with blowing up the problem, and exit the system (load screen). Luckily, you can hail starfleet and report back in without wasting time going back to Sol. The point is -- the game has entirely too many load screens. Even such minor transitions as entering Quark's bar on Ds9 require, you guessed it, a load screen.If you were hoping to knock your opponents shields down, then beam over to their ship and phaser-stun their crew to win a fight... you will be disappointed. The bridge is only there to serve as fluff... it has no function whatsoever. You won't spend any time actually aboard your ship, instead you will pilot it from a 3rd person perspective at all times.Ground combat is lankey and a complete mess. NPC's appear to have no AI whatsoever and stumble on their own feet, as well as having surprising difficulty getting through a door big enough to fly a type 5 shuttle through. Most of the time you just want the ground missions to end quickly so that you can get back to space fighting.While space combat is fun at first, it doesn't take long to become tedious. All of the missions are basically copy/paste scenarios. Even the episode content gets highly repetitive. You might enjoy the game for awhile, but for most people it won't take long for boredom to set in. Once it does, don't expect it to lift. There is also no death penalty whatsoever, which makes space combat even more tedious. There is no risk, and so you're just going through the motions without even thinking about it. Just like Champions Online this game could have been something truly remarkable, but the small-scale design just doesn't allow that to happen. There is a reason Cryptic can pump out games so quickly with their new engine -- because it doesn't require much content at all. The illusion doesn't last, and you soon realize that what you are playing is more akin to arena net than MMO.The one saving grace, besides the well-constructed graphics and good artwork, is the pvp. If you play Klingons that's all the game will offer you, as they have no PvE content to speak of yet. The PvP can be quite entertaining and rewarding, however. The problem is that it becomes just as much of a rinse/repeat exercise as the PvE content does. Playing Klingon makes this resonate even more, since it is the grind that gains you levels. It is also what makes the game feel more like arena net than MMO... the PvP has no more depth than a console game would. Even while playing Federation and going back and forth between PvE and PvP... eventually you will realize that you are doing the same five or six missions over and over and over. The objective for all of them: shoot to kill (and occasionally hit \"\"F\"\" five times on the glowing objects on a barren world).The one thing they did right was character customization. But with Cryptic, at this point, that is pretty much a foregone conclusion. If you are looking for casual gameplay and just some space-shooting then you will likely enjoy this game. If you are looking for something that is a true realization of the Trek franchise in an immersive and expansive MMO environment... expect to be let down dramatically. I would easily say this game is worth an initial $50 investment. I have gotten as much enjoyable game time as I might with any console game in a similar price range. The $15 monthly fee, on the other hand, doesn't quite seem worth it to me.\"", "\"When I first heard about STO, I was really excited. When I heard Perpetual went under, I was saddened because of the possibly of STO being canceled. FInally, I was happy to see Cryptic Studios picking it up and finishing it. Cryptic is the maker of City of Heroes/City of Villians. Champions Online was also created by Cryptic. Something different than the fantasy MMO's.Who hasn't heard of Star Trek; from William Shatner to Scott Bakula. I grew up with the first Star Trek movie and while I don't describe myself as a Trekkie, I loved the movies. Concerning MMO's, the first one I played was Sierra Online's The Realm. I've Beta tested quite a few MMO's and Star Trek Online was one of them. At first I was impressed but I wasn't blown away. The graphics are standard Cryptic Studios. If you've played other Cryptic games, you will feel Deja vu. Same thing goes for the missions and tasks. On a side note concerning the missions in STO, one reviewer said that it's constantly either blowing away baddies, patrolling and blowing up baddies, rescuing people and blow up baddies, and beaming to the surface (or space station) and blowing up baddies. In other words, very repetitive. If you just take the battles, they seem to be very repetitive as well. You have \"\"four shield\"\" zones and if the enemy knocks one part down enough or sends it to zero, you will take high damage (hull breech). You can either go as fast as you can, to escape so that you can repair your shields, or compensate by rerouting all shield strength from your other shields to your \"\"exposed area\"\" of your ship. You also have bridge officers at your disposal. It would of been nice to be able to give them orders, but it's just repetitive clicking depending on which officer you need. Same thing with firing your weapons; click, wait, click, wait, click ect. I sense the battles will get old very quickly. The one good thing is if there is a asteroid near by you can quickly get behind it and you won't take any hits, but if you are being pursued, once you are in range, you will be fired on; there is no gaseous cloud to hide in if you are badly damaged or need to take \"\"cover\"\" as in Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. It would be nice to be able to lock on phasers as well as locking on using torpedoes as you hear the captains in the star trek shows/movies. The graphics showing your ship taking damage is nice. It would be nice to see cinematic scenes or even better graphics as you saw the battle scenes in the movies. What's surely needed: making the battles more strategic. What is nice is the fact that you can control your ship movements and speed. You are given a basic ship that is pretty decent with speed and fire power. If you preordered STO, you were able to get a ship bonus. I preordered with another store (initials of GS) and got the original Enterprise that Capt. Kirk captained.; complete with blue phasers. There were a couple of other preorder bonuses that came with it as well. Depending on which side you are facing your enemy, you can lower that side of their shield. In STO, the enemy doesn't seem to keen on moving quickly when part of their shields are lowered. Most of the times, it's like fighting pirates, you can get a long side of them and just fire away...click, click, click, click. It would of been nice to be able to \"\"click\"\" red alert/battle stations when you are in immenent danger as in the movies and TV shows. WHat would make this different from the rest? I wish Cryptic would give the option of either piloting our ship ourself with NPC's (as the case now) or be able to have other players be your officers or crew. Another player, if he/she was your tactical officer, they would be responsible for locking on the target, locking phasers, aiming torpedoes ect. If you had a officer that was manning the radar and giving advice to the situation (what Spock did), engine officer, communications officer, engineers, and sick bay. To be a true captain of a starship; this would make it more lifelike and certainly would feel more like Star Trek than a piece of cardboard with Star Trek on it yet you take the cardboard away and you see City of Heroes/Champions Online.I've heard of server crashes, nasty lag, and instability in general. I never encountered it. Lag hasn't been an issue as well for me. What I was surprised to see was a manual that was completely lacking. I've never seen a launch date which had almost everyone every second asking questions that a manual could of answered. The manual's wording is horrible as well. Part of me is wishing that Prima makes a guide! On a good note, the tutorial story arc is pretty good at introducing you to the gameplay and key description. The monthly price is steep; 14.95 a month and you get the first month free. For people who preordered, you were able to buy a 12-month subscription or lifetime subscription. In a nutshell, I have the i7 920 processor and Saphire 4890. My frame rates are pretty good.I was pretty torn on how fun is this game and rating it overall. I gave it 3 stars because I don't play it hours on end every day, but I do play it almost everyday. I enjoy playing it but after a while, but when repetition sets in; Im done for the day. Star Trek Online isn't bad but it's not the groundbreaking game it was meant/expected to be or could of been. You'll either love, like it or dislike it; play it for hours or play it for an hour.All and all, it's not horrible but I think in time, it will get better. It would be nice to see if Cryptic will get daring and try new things. If they see the reviews on more than one site, maybe/hopefully they will. I've seen a lot of reviews and comments and yeah, I would love to see more content and some daring \"\"moves\"\" to make STO stand out.\"", "Imagine a Star Trek RPG where you have your own ship and crew and you travel the galaxy, exploring strange new world and seeking out new civilizations, involving yourself in first contact missions, talking to new species, fighting new enemies and feeling like anything could be over the next horizon.Now throw all that away, because instead we got a tired MMO.There is no real RPG here for fans of classic RPGs.  The dialogue is bland and perfunctory, without choice or consequence in any serious measure.  The enemies are all normal Star Trek enemies, and basically reskins of each other.  The exploration is limited to pressing a button on a shiny object and getting some useless mineral reward.  If you imagine a game like Mass Effect, Dragon Age or Fallout with the Star Trek license you will be severely disappointed, because you end up with a bland and stale traditional MMO with no feeling of story, exploration or discovery what-so-ever.  I think we all pretty much knew this would happen when this was announced as a Cryptic MMO instead of a single-player RPG, but it is still disappointing to see.Space combat is probably the saving grace here... very fun, and though insanely repetitive it never really grows old much.  Ground combat is fun but extremely buggy the last time I played, just not a polished experience at all.  Even if combat was awesome across the board though, you still need a reason to fight, and STO gives you nothing... no story, no innovative missions, NOTHING.Unless you love Guild Wars style MMO missions, avoid at all costs, despite the license.  I wish I did.", "\"Before I write my review, let me interest you on my background with MMORPGs. I started with Ultima Online back in the late 90s, then Asherons Call in 1999 for about three years, moved to DAoC in 2000 for another three years, then City of Heroes for about a year, Warhammer for six months, and finally World of Warcraft for two years. I've seen the best and the worst of MMORPGs. Frankly, the best MMORPG I've ever played was Asherons Call because of it's difficulty level, uniqueness, and brutal and unforgiving death penalty (players can open your corpse and take stuff out, loss of exp, loss of stats, etc).STO (Star Trek Online) is a new MMORPG. Expect to see bugs at this early stage of it's growing process. There are lots of issues that need to be fixed but just like any MMORPG out there, there will be issues for the next six months until it gets stabilized. ANybody who cries foul that this game is a failure at this early stage probably only played World of Warcraft. Give this game a few years and it will only get better. Also as a tip...do NOT go for a lifetime subscription on this game or on any MMORPG. NEVER. You'll never know what will happen down the road.Let's begin with the review. This is based on two weeks of playing STO.OBJECTIVE- Live long and prosper and attain the rank of Admiral (level cap).GAMEPLAY- You start out as a Lieutenant with a light starship. It's agile its fast but not tough enough to withstand multiple Klingon Bird of Prey attacks. You are assigned three officers at the start. There are three classes in this game: ENGINEER, SCIENCE, and TACTICAL. Each class is subdivided into two general skills: SPACE combat and GROUND combat. ENGINEER is like your buffer. SCIENCE is like your healer. TACTICAL is like your tank. Your class and your bridge officers should be well rounded in both SPACE and Ground combat. As you kill stuff and complete quests, you earn skill points that you can use for your character and your bridge officers. You can distribute your points based on where you wish to focus your skills on. DO you want to build yours skills in Space combat and then leave out Ground combat? Or Ground and leave Space? Or create a balanced character? These development in skills will determine how well you perform in combat. There are TONS of races that you can choose as well. You will be asked to choose two main skills that you wish to place on your race. I chose Vulcan so I chose Accuracy and Mind Meld.As you complete missions, you will also earn merit points. The merit points are like experience points. The more exp you get, the faster you can attain the next rank. Each rank is subdivided into 10 levels. You start as a Lieutenant, then 10 levels later, you become a Lieutenant Commander, then 10 levels later, you become a Commander, etc. As you gain ranks, you are awarded a free ship based on that rank. So a Lieutenant that gets promoted to Lt. Commander, gets awarded with a Cruiser or any ship of your choice as long as you meet the requirements to pilot that ship, mainly the rank you have. As you gain rank, you will be awarded with additional bridge officers that you can level up. Bridge officers are like PETS.There are energy points also. This is the main currency. Basically you sell loot so you can buy ship, personal, and personnel upgrades. You also earn Badges of Explorations. These are badges awarded to you when you complete exploration missions. The badges have tiers as well, they run from 1st order badges to 4th order badges. You start with 1st order badges and then slowly as you complete exploration missions, you get the next tier of badges. Badges are used to purchase better equipment. Equipment purchased using badges are much better than items purchased using energy points.COMBAT- Space:  Space combat is a fire and forget type of combat. Just keep firing and you're bound to hit the enemy ship. If you want to do better damage, you can use skills you've developed with your own character and with your bridge officers. These skills are translated into how powerful your attacks and repairs are, this includes photon torpedo buffs, beam array and cannon buffs, and shield/protection buffs. If let's say you focused too much on Ship Repair for space combat, chances are you won't be able to bring down a tougher ship but at the same time you'll be unstoppable since your ship has a higher repair skill. On the other hand, if you concentrated your space combat skills on Photon Beam attacks and no Ship Repair, you'll be able to take down an enemy ship fast but you'll probably be taking TONS of damage during combat and probably blowing up into space dust when the dust clears. Space combat can be likened to Flight simulators...it's a dogfight out in space. SPace combat is done on a 3rd person view.COMBAT- Ground: Similar to space combat. Combat ground is a fire and forget type of combat. Keep firing your weapon, command your away team (your bridge officers) to attack/assist same target, and you'll probably win the gunbattle. You use the same logic in terms of skill use in ground combat. Should you have focused on more heals to outlast that Klingon warrior or maybe focused more on gun play. The choice is yours. Gunplay is done on a 3rd person view.MISSIONS- All missions are instanced based. Meaning, you don't ride your ship across space, enter the atmosphere, land your ship, and then jump out and run to your mission spot. In STO, there are space systems that you enter. If you have a mission in that space system, a loading screen appears and the mission begins. Once you complete the mission, you beam out and then request your ship to warp out. There are random encounters while you travel between space systems. Again, you don't see any mobs in this game until you enter an instance or you go into a Deep Space encounter. Have you ever played the old Final Fantasy games where you don't see the enemy until a loading screen suddenly appears and then all hell breaks lose? Yup those are Deep Space encounters in STO.INTERESTING TREKKIE MOMENTS- Audio and other stuff: Yes all the familiar sounds of STar Trek are here. From the phaser scan to the \"\"tweek tweek\"\" sound when you open your communication device, to the \"\"poowongwish\"\" sound when you beam up or beam down. You'll find those pesky tribbles, the arrogant Klingon, the sneaky business tactics of the Ferengis, the sinister Borgs, yes they are all here. Even the ship designs remain true to the Star Trek feel. The uniforms span from the original series (if you have the deluxe edition) to the newest Starfleet uniforms.  Voice narration was provided by the great Vulcan himself...Leonard Nimoy.GRAPHICS- You need a strong system to run this game to max quality. Graphics are quite good. They are clean and well-defined. The architecture stuck with the Star Trek feel and ambience. Cryptic managed to mix the original Star Trek design with the more modern Star Trek architecture. All in all the graphics are good.BUGS- Extremely long load times in high populated areas. Yes the long load times are a killer but they recently released a patch to fix this. If for some reason you are still experiencing long load times even after patching, you can workaround it by decreasing your graphics quality. Simply reducing the Viewing Distance will fix the long load times. Also there is only one server in this game. Everyone gets to login to the same server be it Europe, Asia, or North America. Downside is that during high population logins, you may have to wait for a 1 minute queue.Some functionality in the RENAME option is still not fixed. There is an option to RENAME your character but nobody has figured out how to RENAME it. It will tell you to go to the RENAME option before login. Guess what...the RENAME is still missing at the login page.A few mission objectives are missing. I did one mission where it asked me to investigate a damaged starship. I couldn't find it and decided to just quit the mission.You get stuck in some areas. I was on a  ground mission. I went down a steep hill. I couldn't find a way to get back up. Had to ask my ship to beam me up and abandon the mission.Repetitive mission encounters. Quite a few mission encounters are repetitive. They first ask you to access a computer. Then proceed to another computer. Then fight off a main squad of baddies. Then fight off a second squad of baddies. Then access final computer. THen beam up and end mission. For some reason, the pattern on a lot of the missions run in this logic.OVERALL: This game has a lot of potential. It's still a new game. It still has a lot of issues. But it shouldn't stop you fromn trying this game out. Judge this game six months down the road when everything is stable. And to those who say Cryptic should've caught the bugs before it was released, I'd say this is an MMORPG. It's bound to have bugs. It's a good thing for me because the game just keeps getting better as more bugs are fixed. Bugs lead to fixes which in turn leads to improvements and possibly better gameplay in the end. Try to avoid comparing it to say WOW. ALthough WOW was released in a stable format. It did undergo TONS upon TONS of patches during it's five year reign, that it made the entire game SO easy and forgiving. Give STO a chance but remember...don't do a lifetime subscription.\"", "\"This game is baffling.Normally, I can tell you that Cryptic is a game company that releases a solid game engine with a good, if shallow game design.  They've never been a company that releases \"\"epic\"\" games but what they've done in the past has at least been fun with some interesting gameplay elements and decent design ideas, fully implemented.With Star Trek Online, I can't say that.  The game is basically a wreck.  There's a good engine behind it, good artwork, some good \"\"look and feel\"\" of Star Trek but so very much of this game is poorly designed, poorly thought out and apparently hastily thrown together in ways that often make no sense.  Whoever designed this game should, for their own good, go back to whatever they were doing previously and never be allowed near game design again.  What they have done here is simply terrible.  There's probably a law against what they have done here.The skills are a mess.  At some point they're going to have to sit down and redesign them.  The skill system itself isn't bad but the actual skills you can train up are poorly defined and poorly thought out.  Some of them are clearly a waste to train in.  It's like they came up with a list of 10 good skills that made sense, realized they needed a lot more than that and just threw down the first things that came to mind, whether it was a good idea or not, whether it made sense or not.Federation gameplay is not very well thought out.  You will frequently find yourself alone in your ship wasting entire legions of what should be far more powerful enemy ships.  Granted this is standard MMORPG fare (\"\"You must kill 30 of the dangerous Bugbeasts of Blatterthorp!  Their teeth are razor sharp!  Their eyes can kill a man just by.... oh, you're back already?  Already killed all 30?  Huh.  Well nevermind then.\"\") but it's just a bit more inexcusable to use that old formula in a game that's supposed to be Star Trek.  Yes, the Enterprise was a powerful ship but no, it never went off and killed 5 squadrons of 3 Klingon Birds of Prey singlehandedly.  You'll do this in roughly every other mission in Star Trek Online, however.  By the time you make it to level 10 you'll probably have been responsible for killing what must have been thousands of alien crewmen because you've killed so very many ships.Basically, a good Star Trek RPG is going to have to innovate a little bit when it comes to mission design and Cryptic clearly did not do that.  They followed the usual MMORPG one-man-army hack-and-slash model and it just doesn't make sense for this setting.  The combat mechanics are fun and interesting but the actual design of the content is just....thoughtless.And while this game has a playable Klingon faction and PvP between the Federation and the Klingons, it's very poorly designed and rampant with bugs.  Cryptic did say that Klingon content was going to be \"\"spartan\"\" but they should have said \"\"broken and poorly designed\"\".  The PvP game design actually has taken a step backwards from Champions Online, which I also find baffling.  The game makes no effort to ensure that the teams are even before starting a match; most maps are simply 5v5 deathmatches; what maps have mechanics behind them are unintuitive (just you go on and try to figure out how you can tell when a capturable point has really been captured).  Klingons themselves still have broken vendors limiting their access to gear a full 3 weeks after release.  I mean, I understand that Klingon content is \"\"spartan\"\" but you guys can't even get the VENDORS checked out and working properly after 3 weeks?  That's just terrible.And endgame content - Cryptic's motto for game development has always been \"\"what do you mean, 'endgame content'?\"\"  It's just not something they do.  I have long since come to accept that.  Normally what you do in a Cryptic game is roll 8 different characters and level them up because there's great diversity in character builds but Star Trek Online doesn't even have that.  It has no apparent endgame, you only get 3 character slots and even if you had more than 3 you probably wouldn't have much use for it.And for all this they're talking about \"\"microtransactions\"\", using real money for in-game perks and extras and they're selling \"\"lifetime subscriptions\"\".  Hey buddy, this game isn't really even worth what I already paid for it.  I'm sure not paying more anytime soon and I doubt I'll continue my subscription into the second month, much less pay for a lifetime!  Cryptic needs to stop talking about how they're going to get more money from us and start seriously addressing why this game is so terrible and what they plan to do about it.  I don't want more videos with more voiceovers and more misrepresentation of game content.  I want to see some serious talk, and Cryptic hasn't been doing that.Basically this game is a train wreck.It's sophomoric.  That's the best word for it.  It's like amateur hour in there.  Totally mindless game design rushed through to completion delivering a product reminiscent of a college student who has remembered he has a 10 page paper due tomorrow after a night of heavy drinking.Maybe it was rushed.  Maybe the designer wears his pants on his head.  I don't know what, exactly, the root cause is.  But it's terrible.  Good engine.  Good graphics and sound.  Some good mechanics in there.  Bizarrely bad design elements and gameplay.  I'm frankly baffled that a game company with 3 other MMORPGs under its belt would release something this bad.\"", "Hmm not sure where to begin...This game, if given any other name, would have gotten a 5 star review for these alone:BOFF customizationsWeapon CustomizationsExploit/Expose combat systemBut we're talking Star Trek here, and there are some things about the way they made this game that made it feel very UN-Star Trek like. The most blatantly obvious fact:WHERE'S THE BRIDGE?You cant hail other ships from it, cant engage to warp speed from it...in fact, there absolutely nothing you can do from the bridge.There's a story Arc, but its not completed so while it fills out you are left grinding...and it's during the grind where you start noticing stuff... like how apart from a few sound effects and songs, this is just yet another rushed out the door, 'develop-as-we-go' MMO.Which would be fine, except that you have this entire 25yr money making cash cow  called Star Trek bank rolling your project...and it still feels very generic.Also during the grind you start to notice things, like how star ships, docking stations, even underground caverns all have 35ft high ceilings, like giants lived here. I never watched a ST episode where I couldnt see the ceiling of any hallway, room or location they were.But I will say, even after all that - I still signed up for a subscription because despite it's shortcomings, make no mistake, it's definitely FUN - and the ships look awesome and the space combat is epic (well, the first 500 fights are). You can mix n match parts to customize the look of your starship.The expose/explot combat system removes the tedium of killing mobs by looking for/ waiting for/ creating explots on your enemies.The game is less than a year old, so hopefully they have time to make improvements before everyone starts to bail.But in closing, its time for these PC Video game makers to start finishing their products before releasing them.No other manufacturer does this - imagine you buy a car and the brakes are weak, the steering wheel is missing and you only have 2 of 4 tires - but they want you to pay the full price and MAYBE we'll ship out your parts at a later date - thats BS", "Star Trek Online (STO) is a quality MMO with impressive graphics, engaging combat, and some entertaining content. Ultimately, however, it suffers from an excess of prosaic and repetitive content, hampered by a curious absence of the exploratory and diplomatic aspects so synonymous with the Star Trek franchise.STO remains reasonably true to the source material. Many elements and characters are pulled directly from virtually all of the television series and films, and most are used in entertaining ways. Overall, however, the quality content is too sparse and revolves entirely around combat (absent is the diplomacy, mystery, and scientific wonder of the franchise). The many random missions that monopolize the players' time is painfully rushed and pumped out by a content-generation engine that leads to mission after mission that looks the same and has the same objectives.This rushed feeling extends to the pacing of the advancement. You will only be able to captain a new type of ship, and therefore customize and improve it, every ten levels. There are only 50 levels to advance through which means four new ships. To make things worse each ten-level stretch gets predictably longer and longer, and by level 15 it devolves into a pretty bad grind - largely due to the repetitive content. However, as I mentioned, there is some very enjoyable missions to be found within the avalanche of banality, and the space combat is well executed (even in PvP, which is rare in newly-launched MMOs). The ground (away mission) combat is, to put it simply, tedious and clearly unfinished. The ground content is so bad that you begin dreading having to partake in such missions - they serve to detract heavily from the game and make you just want to rush through them.There is virtually no exploration in this game. Not even within your starship, which is odd for a Star Trek RPG: most of every movie and episode occured within the confines of the Enterprise or some other ship. All you ever get to see is the bridge in STO, and occassionally other portions of other ships during the terrible away missions.Overall this isn't a bad MMO. It sways uneasily being being a good MMO, and a mediocre MMO with too many boring stretches. It does nothing to innovate or attract an audience outside of the genre, so be aware that STO is firmly set in the pre-WoW model of grindy MMO (though it is not nearly as repetitive or grindy as recent MMOs like Aion). If you really want to try a Star Trek RPG, especially a MMO, I'd say give it a shot. If you're on the fence, hold off for several months while the content gets refined and fleshed out.", "I heard how bad this game was when it came out. But being the true Star Trek fan that i am i bought it. From what i heard i did it at the right time. They have released their first big update called season 2. I'm having a blast with this game. I can't remember the last time i had a late night session playing an online game. I found a great fleet to join and they are so helpfull. Now the game has plenty of non combat missions and really does feel like Star Trek now. They are going to be adding all kinds of content on a regular basis. If you left the game you should really check it out again. It just goes to show you that the way mmo's are reviewed needs to be changed. These games get better with time."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.15114544332027435, 0.008687549270689487, 0.027504608035087585, 0.09593426436185837, 0.11406620591878891, 0.0192401222884655, 0.09108901023864746, 0.07190991193056107, 0.054492056369781494, 0.07727204263210297, 0.06926985085010529, 0.07908477634191513, 0.07090099900960922, 0.06940316408872604]]}
