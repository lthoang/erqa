If my wife would allow it, I would have an iPhone/iPod player in every room of the house, even though we already have a whole-house sound system...  That being said, the Luna Voyager is really more of a desk/nightstand clock + charger than it is a sound system, unless your current sound system is aHasbro i-Dog Robotic Music Loving Canine - WhiteYes, it plays the music from the iThing of your choice, but the fidelity really isn't much more than you'll get from the typical radio alarm clock in this price category. It is a mediocre sound device.However, where the unit excels (and exceeds my expectations) is in the ease of setup, use, and day-to-day function.  Some examples:1. Automatically sets the time based on your iPhone (or iPod).  Seriously cool feature, especially if you live in an area with frequent power outages and HATE resetting all the digital clocks in the house like I do!2. The display can be dimmed AND TURNED OFF ALTOGETHER!  With an easy twirl of the \"\"clickwheel\"\" thingie on top, you can dial up or down the brightness of the display, including turning it completely off, which is a requirement at sleepy time in our bedroom (the wife forbids anything \"\"electronic\"\" from shining, buzzing, humming, blinking, or making its existence otherwise known in our bedroom).3. Nice and small - hides nicely onto a nightstand.  Even if you're furniture is all Chippendale, it won't throw off your bedroom (or office) mojo too badly.One thing to note - the unit seems to be billed as a \"\"travel\"\" clock, but I can't see why.  I travel A LOT and I can't see ever bringing this unit with me on the road for a couple of reasons - first it is too bulky (I always carry-on so space is a premium for me), secondly it doesn't run on batteries, which I would think is a requirement for a \"\"travel\"\" version of anything...  A travel clock bigger than a pack of cigarettes is not worth the space in my book.My only other nit is that the wheel used for adjustments doesn't spin very easily.  You have to \"\"two-finger\"\" the unit in order to get enough friction against it to make it turn smoothly.  The only other controls are two tiny chrome buttons - one for Play/Pause and the other for setting the alarm mode.When we talk about ease of use, I can illustrate how easy it is by re-writing the user manual (in my own words) that will cover all necessary functionality:--------Plug the unit inStick your iPhone/IPod unit into the topTo play music, press the Play/Pause button. To pause, press the button again.  Spin the dial to change the volume.To set the alarm, push the Alarm button and twirl the dial to the time you want.  To alternate between Alarm, iPod, or Off, repeatedly press the Alarm buttonTo change brightness, press and hold the Play/Pause button while turning the dial to achieve the desired brightness---------That's pretty much it, unless you want to switch from 12h/24h mode, which is a switch on the back.  =)Overall, a super easy-to-use iPhone/iPod Alarm Clock & Charger that is convenient to have at the bed side and unobtrusive enough to have a high SAF (Spousal Acceptance Factor).\"", "XtremeMac's new Luna Voyager is a travel alarm clock that works with your iPod/iPhone. Essentially, the device is an alarm clock with a port for an Apple iPod or iPhone on top. I tested it with both an iPhone 4 and an iPhone 3GS. I plugged the unit in and placed my iPhone 4 into the port; the clock quickly set its time to the time in the iPhone. You can adjust the time to run as a 12 hour clock with am/pm indicators or as a 24 hour clock. The clock display can be dimmed by steps from off to bright. At its brightest setting, the clock was easily visible in a bright room. The dimmest setting would be perfect for a bedside scene, but the ability to turn the numbers off entirely is a nice option for those annoyed by any light in the bedroom. The numbers are large enough to be legible at 10 feet. Numerals are presented in blue.Press the play button on the top surface and you instantly can listen to your music. To skip from song to song, or to choose a specific song, you'll need to activate the iPhone or iPod; after that, songs will play in order as presented by your Apple device. There are two speakers, one on each side of the Voyager, so you get reasonable stereo. Remember that this is a small unit so audiophiles might prefer the Luna SST. Bass is lacking, but the overall effect is louder and superior to that of the iPhone's single internal speaker. Of course, there's a tradeoff here for size; the unit's small size makes it easy to toss into a suitcase for traveling. We chose to place the unit in the kitchen as a small clock & music source on the countertop.There are several adaptors that allow for insertion of various iPod and iPhone varieties. I used one for the iPhone 3GS. Once inserted, the adaptor can be removed with use of a letter opener or small knife blade by following the instructions in the well-written manual. Both iPhones were charged by the port, something that not all devices handle properly.The clock can be set up to be set manually. This is an advantage for those living in areas (St. Louis comes to mind) where the time presented by the iPhone from the network is sometimes inaccurate. There is a battery compartment for two AAA's to preserve the clock and alarm settings in the event of a power failure. There is also a Line-In jack on the back of the unit. This jack is not described in the users manual and was undoubtedly a last-minute addition to the overall product. It isn't clear to me what type of plug this is although it seems to be a mini-jack similar to the jack on the iPhone.The appearance of the unit is pleasing. The materials used are slick and contemporary. All the buttons and switches work properly. There is a dial on the top of the unit for setting the dimming level, the alarm time, and the volume. The dial is a neat idea as it's flat and therefore prevents the unit from having a bump on the top, but it is a little unwieldy to use, not quite turning as smoothly as it might. I'd recommend that the source for this particular component be upgraded a notch. The overall presentation and packaging is high-end, equivalent to anything you'd see from Apple or other high tech companies, and clearly designed to give the new owner a sense of gratification.Bottom line: Buy the Luna Voyager if the low price point is critical, if you're short on space in your desired location, or if you plan to use this for travel. Go up a step to the Luna SST if you'd rather have improved sound and don't mind the loss of travel abilities or space.", "4.5 starsPlusses: Easy to use, charges your phone while also becoming a music alarm clock, not too big (but still pretty large), solidly-made.Minus: no battery operation. Sure, using batts would drain them fast if the phone was charging, but there could be an easy fix: have the phone not be charged during battery usage. Simple. Unfortunately for business travellers who must get up on time, if the power goes out in your hotel, so does this alarm clock. Plus the ac adaptor is rather large. This thing should have a rechargeable battery. Too bad it doesn't.But if you can live with that risk (or also use a backup mini alarm), then this is a good device at a fair price.", "What a wonderful system. The packaging is great. I don't normally mention packaging, however, I was impressed enough that I thought it deserved mentioning. Everything is orderly and packaged like a high end product (which this is, as you will see). As a gift, this will win favor! The actual unit seems to be made very well, and does not feel like a light piece of junk. It is sleek and compact, and yes,  one could take this on trips (but it is so nice looking that I would be afraid to scratch it, lol). As an alarm clock all you have to do is dock your iPod! It comes with several different adaptors for iPhone, iPod, etc. Sound quality is not bad for the price and size. It is nothing like my HK, but then it is not supposed to be. The sound is a little sharp, but again, I'm not using this as a main music source. This has now become my new alarm clock. I love being able to access my music easily and waking up to my own songs are great. If you need a new alarm clock and want one that integrates with your iPod, iPhone, iTouch, look no further. The numbers are clear and sharp. The display can be dimmed or totally shut off for those sensitive to any light while they sleep. We get power outages at times, and the battery back-up is great! I love the dial on top. It takes a little getting used to, but it's a novelty for me, and makes it look better. I never thought an alarm clock could look so good.....Though you have to remember this is much more than just an alarm clock. It's also a music player, and a decent one at that!", "This item is NOT fully compatible with the iPhone 4. A message on the phone pops up saying so when you plug it in. There is NO adapter for the iPhone 4 so it's a loose fit and will probably end up either breaking the dock or messing up the phone...The sound quality is very poor, I mean very poor! The internal speaker of the iPhone 4 sounds better. The wheel is a terrible way to control the settings. You have to spin the dial to snooze, which is not an easy thing to do awake in the light, let alone early in the morning in the dark when you're half asleep. The blue light of the clock looks cool but is awful at night when you are sleeping without glasses. It's basically a blue glow. The lowest brightness is still too bright. Pretty much lights up the room. It's worth $10 tops."], "Gamma": [0.16711050271987915, 0.16711050271987915, 0.16711050271987915, 0.16711050271987915, 0.16444753110408783, 0.16711050271987915], "Beta": [[0.8096356391906738, 0.028375452384352684, 0.01941344514489174, 0.08288900554180145, 0.05968648940324783], [0.8096356391906738, 0.028375452384352684, 0.01941344514489174, 0.08288900554180145, 0.05968648940324783], [0.8096356391906738, 0.028375452384352684, 0.01941344514489174, 0.08288900554180145, 0.05968648940324783], [0.8096356391906738, 0.028375452384352684, 0.01941344514489174, 0.08288900554180145, 0.05968648940324783], [0.8080142140388489, 0.02900729514658451, 0.019723623991012573, 0.08240718394517899, 0.060847703367471695], [0.8096356391906738, 0.028375452384352684, 0.01941344514489174, 0.08288900554180145, 0.05968648940324783]]}
