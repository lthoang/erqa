Here is my take on the device:PROs:Compact, secures well to the windshield or mounting diskCharges the iphone 3G just fine and the iphone 4 (with a workaround)Works fairly well acquiring satellites, but I haven't noticed any significant improvement over using the Tom Tom app without the mountCONs:MAJOR CON: The USB and line out connection ports are on the MOVEABLE part of the mount instead of on the stationary base!  What this means is that when you rotate the device from portrait to landscape (or vice-versa or in-between), the cables rotate with it!  To make matters worse, this means that if you try to route the cables to hide most of the slack, you need to leave enough extra visible slack to allow for free movement, thus making things look more cluttered.  The cables can also bind when you rotate the device because they are moving with the device.  WHY DIDN'T THEY PLACE THE LINE OUT AND USB PORTS ON THE BASE THAT STAYS STATIONARY ALL OF THE TIME?When you slide the unit right & left (landscape) or up and down (portrait), the unit does not always stay secured where you set it. Yes, you can improve on this by sliding it all of the way to one end, but that is not always practicalThe arm (stem) is too short.  If you mount the unit on the dashboard using the disc, it is difficult to adjust it to a point where it will clear the dashboard when in portrait mode.  This severely limits your choices in positioning the unit for convenient use in both portrait and landscape modes.If you have an iphone 4, the unit will not work right out of the box because the iphone 4's thinner design prevents the unit from activating the switch in the unit.  There is an easy workaround, however, which is to place some velcro or a \"\"rubber feet\"\" on the mount to compensate for the lack of thickness of the iphone 4I noticed some ignition noise type of hum when using the unit, but this may be more an issue with my car than the Tom Tom mount (I am not sure at this point)I have not tried the bluetooth function because I have a bluetooth stereo in my car, and it is more convenient to use by pairing the iphone to the car stereo (it allows ALL audio sources to pause during phone calls that way)In a nutshell, the placement of the line out and USB connections would prevent me from buying this again.\"", "I have had this for a while and its very nice.  Too expensive of course, but it folds up very small and is easily installed and works well.  However, it doesn't work with the iPhone 4.  The phone isn't thick enough to push a little hinged plate back and as a result it doesn't get a charge and will rapidly run out of batteries while you're using your Nav (I use Navigon, works fine with that) even though you have the cigarette lighter plugged in.  In theory, Tom Tom offers a free adapter to fix this issue, some little plastic thing you stick on your existing adapter to fix this, but getting one of those has proven impossible.  I ordered it, didn't get it.  Opened a case. They didn't send it, closed the case.  Opened another case.  They didn't send it.  Not sure how this will ever turn out.  This is for a 60-cent piece of plastic mind you.  Not sure what would happen if I actually had to have the unit repaired or something that would cost them real money.  Ridiculous level of support.", "While I initially thought the value of this product was extremely poor I came away far happier having actually used the product extensively on a road trip. Sure, I think the price should be closer to fifty bucks but when all is said and done you also feel better by reducing duplication and clutter. But the key is that the product has more than appears at first glance***** Performance - with the TomTom 1.5 navigation software - it just works, there were some very minor hiccups, but I found it entirely dependable and solid on the iPhone and wouldn't hesitate to rely on it as the only navigation/map in the car. It also looks brilliant on the Retina display (which 1.5 makes use of).***** Construction - very ruggedly built, no worries jamming it in a suitcase. The unit always attached the first time to the window, didn't fall off with fog or condensation or bumps. I also felt that it absorbed harsh bumps and although the iPhone doesn't have any moving parts, I just felt better about the docking safety. It's also impossible for the iPhone to fall out as far as I can tell.***** Extra GPS receiver - worked far faster and more reliably than the iPhone one (which is quite good to begin with). The only thing that threw it off were sharp cliffs and only for a few seconds then.***** Charger - lights up so you know its on, keeps unit charged well and you almost always leave the car with 100% charge.***** Speaker - plenty loud enough and far better than the iPhone embedded speaker--- Negatives** Battery Health - When mounted to the window on a bright sunny day the black iPhone 4 gets extremely warm due to the sun. Most traditional GPS's don't have batteries so it's not a problem, but for an iPhone the battery is likely the most sensitive component and the one part that is most likely to deteriorate in performance. Although I haven't experienced any negative short-term effects it did make me feel a little guilty about the long term implications.* No Compass Integration - until you start moving the navigation software doesn't make use of a compass to determine which direction you are pointing. Kind of annoying.Note: No maps or software are included", "Sent this along to my father who spends two hours a day on the road and had, at the time, recently purchased the Tom Tom nav app for his iPhone.He was thrilled to get this because he'd considered buying it but wasn't sure if it would be worth the money.  In the end, he was glad he wasn't out the $100.Initially, my father simply plugged the phone in without realizing he needed to download and install a piece of software needed to make the Tom Tom app properly communicate with the hardware but he resolved that matter.Then, for a couple of weeks, he enjoyed the hands-free holder and charging capability of the Tom Tom car kit. He never thought the GPS boosting capability was as good as was claimed, but he didn't drive out of his routine driving area enough to say for certain.After a couple of weeks, some glitch kept causing a warning to appear saying 'this device doesn't support the iPhone' and would refuse to charge it. This happened every day after awhile. My father was willing to learn to live with that because he liked the hands-free aspect. But there was the warning beep. Once the car kit stopped charging it would beep loudly every couple of minutes. He couldn't figure out how to disable that and thought, regardless, once the advisory popped up that charging had stopped the device shouldn't keep beeping like that.In the end he stopped using it because he didn't have  lot of time to otherwise invest in figuring out these glitches.Truly disappointing product.", "I initially liked the product thinking it was just hardware. I soon discovered I needed the Tom Tom app to disable the annoying pop up to get you to download their software if you are using another vendor's. That killed it for me. As other reviewers have mentioned there are car kits in the $20-$40 range, with out the hassle.Try one of them . Not recommended!", "I don't have the TomTom app for my iPhone, so here's what this product does for me:First, it charges my iPhone 3GS just fine. I click the phone into the cradle, which is so easy i don't worry about damaging my phone by forcing it in, and presto, it starts charging.Second, i plugged the cable i used to use to connect my iPhone to my car stereo into the cradle instead, and as soon as it's docked, i can play music from my iPhone through the car stereo. (This also means that instead of plugging two cords in, one to the bottom and one to the top of my phone, i just click it into the cradle and it's ready to go. Very convenient.) (Note: you are going to need some adapter to play music through your car stereo, and what you'll need depends on what kind of stereo you have. This product only comes with the cradle and the cigarette lighter charging cord.)Third, when i'm bored, i fire up the (free) TomTom car kit app and let it show me satelite strength of the GSP reading. I don't live in a city with tall buildings, so most of the time my signal strength is just fine. (Note: if you don't have the free car kit app, you'll get annoying pop-up error messages on your phone when you dock it. The app is free, and if you don't care about GPS signal strength and the like, you only have to run it once.)What i haven't done with this product:1) I haven't set up the bluetooth. I don't talk on the phone in the car, so it's not something i need.2) I haven't mounted the cradle in my car. There's really nowhere convenient to put it in my Prius, so i just rest it in one of the center console cup holders.2a) Despite that, i have jiggered with the mounting and rotating mechanism a fair bit. Some other reviews complain that the cradle rotates too easily from portrait to landscape, but it actually takes a little bit of muscle to turn mine. I can't imagine it ever rotating accidentally. Perhaps there was a design flaw that they fixed recently?)In all, i use this primarily as a charging stereo dock for my phone, and it's a bit expensive for just that. However, for people who do use bluetooth for hands-free calls in the car, and who actually want to mount their phone to their dashboard (for example, to use the maps app while driving), this would be a good way to do it, assuming your dash isn't so crowded with other stuff that there's no room.", "Have you ever tried navigating using your iPhone as a GPS device while driving? It isn't perfect. But, Tom Tom has added a new dimension that greatly enhances the experience. With the Tom Tom Car Kit for iPhone, you get a number of improvements... First off, it mounts to your dash and holds the iPhone up where you can see it with the fear of multi-car pile ups. Second, the cradle has a built in GPS receiver that greatly increases the accuracy of your Tom Tom software over just the iPhone's built in GPS receiver. The built in speaker works very well and provides an easy to hear audible directions.In addition to enhancing your iPhone as a GPS navigation device, this car kit also provides a nice speakerphone capability built in that is better than just using the phone. If you live in a state like California, this is a big plus as getting got on the phone without a speaker or bluetooth headset has become a serious pain in the legal system."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.7580639123916626, 0.010189488530158997, 0.0038561245892196894, 0.0015870678471401334, 0.1903066188097, 0.03436324745416641, 0.001633616047911346]]}
