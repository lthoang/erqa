There are many good things about this system that make it an excellent purchase (perhaps not a \"\"must buy\"\" but a great purchase nonetheless!):- Graphics are sharp, crisp, colors pop and overall it is ultra pleasing to the eye- I love the color (I got Aqua Blue) and surprisingly it is not a fingerprint magnet- Enhanced options and potentially netflix and some game boy and game boy color remakes virtual- Analog stick is responsive, easy to use, and us fans can say Nintendo finally heard us!- I was very surprised to hear a rich vibrant sound coming from this unit. I didn't have headphones on and it was much better than the DSiXL unit- The menu navigations are good but the three buttons do take some getting used to- The stylus feels classy and I love the adjustability of it - very nice for all types of handsThere are many other benefits to this system and my fellow reviewer's have covered most of them. I myself use the unit to play games - I typically don't take photo's or surf the web or do various other sort of extra things. Sleep mode would be a good example - where you can put your 3DS in sleep mode and it does various things. If you are interested in those then check out the excellent video reviews posted.However I have a caveat for anyone that suffers from migraine's or headaches. I played for an hour and a half in 3D last night and I had a massive migraine this morning. I felt the beginnings of a headache last night but I didn't expect to be hit with the whole light sensitive, nausea and vomiting, misery of this morning. So I searched the net to find out if that was a potential issue and sure enough it is. Does that mean I won't play my 3DS? Heck no but I've found some hints and helps I'm going to list here so anyone who is like me can make a informed purchase choice:- Really work the slider to find the exact sweet spot - you will know when it is not because it is blurry. If you find yourself seeing blurry for any length of time (several minutes) then turn the 3D off for a while to rest your eyes- Wear your glasses if they are designed for this distance- Play 3D and 2D varying between the two and pay close attention to any sort of nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.- Do not let your child under 7 play this and with kids 7 and older I'd really watch them - Nintendo has stated this 3D is not recommended for children's eyes that are not yet developed- Take frequent breaks and allow your eyes to do other things at different focus levels. So don't go, for example, from playing to reading which is usually about the same distance field. Try for shifts so that your eyes can focus at different levels and distances.I'm not negging on the system - because I am sure this effect of headaches will probably only affect a small percentage of the population. However when you are one of those few and realize your beloved new unit actually causes pain and misery - well you want to be sure that you do what you can to make sure others' don't suffer needlessly.Overall I am most impressed by this unit. I think it is a fantastic step for Nintendo who continue to break new ground with their products, and I can recommend it to adults and older children. I don't use the camera so I cannot comment on that. Of course the battery life is less - which is a bummer but much has been made of it already. I will update my review if I learn more on the headache issue and how to combat it or any further tips in that direction. The reason for the 4 stars is because I wish more had been made of the potential headache issue by Nintendo - I don't recall reading much research and, for those of us who are prone to this sort of thing, it would have been nicer to see this tested more thoroughly or if they did test it to release the results.\"", "\"Nintendo has become \"\"The Company That Tries\"\" over the last decade. They created motion controls well before Microsoft and Sony jumped on board. And now they're revolutionizing 3D imaging with the 3DS. I was excited to see where they could go with this, and while it's not perfect, the 3DS is clearly the future of handhelds. Hell, the 3DS may be the machine that spurs on other forms of entertainment. I know I wouldn't have bought the 3DS if I had had to wear those silly glasses that come with 3D movies and TVs....The 3D is cool. Really cool, in fact. The pre-loaded game Face Raiders is more than enough to show what the system is capable of. The game itself uses whatever shoes up on the camera as the background, and slowly breaks it away while you have to shoot 3D images of your face (or a friends face) as they fly at you from all directions. The other game AR Cards, is a little clunky as it requires you keep the camera always pointed in the same direction to play, but it's still a fine example of what 3D can do. And what's best, above all else, is that all you have to do to turn the 3D off or on is pushed a tiny button up or down, even during play....That being said, it's not entirely perfect. I kind of wish the screen was the same size as the DSi XL. The smaller screen kind of makes the 3D harder to tolerate over longer play times. The buttons, too, aren't as comfortable as they could be. First, the Left and Right triggers are small and placed very close to the edges of the system. And the D-Pad is tight and place a tiny bit low. The new analog stick is nice but it feels kind of high. Obviously, they're trying to keep the system small, but if you've got big hands this system can get uncomfortable because of the awkward button placement.The accessories are also pretty cool. Being to take 3D pics of your surroundings seems underwhelming (since all we have to do is look up from the screen at whatever it is we are taking a picture of) but it really is a neat feature. It's not overwhelming but still neat. I didn't play much with the 3DS Sound (beyond blowing fart noises into it) but what little I did it has a little potential to make some incredible stuff. Then there is the Activity Log, which includes the pedometer. It keeps a daily log on the steps you take on a daily basis. This brings me to my last point: just walking with the 3DS in your pocket adds to the game. You get coins which can be used in games to buy features and other such bonus items.All in all, the 3DS is a pretty phenomenal system considering it's the first of it's kind. Is it worth buying if you got a DS already? Honestly that's a question for the individual. If you enjoy 3D movies then yes, get this. If 3D gives you headaches this will have your head pounding in no time. Plus, as of the release of this system, there really aren't many good games that support the system (Street Fighter and Star Wars are probably the two best) right now, so waiting probably would be a bad idea if you're unsure of whether or not to pick this up.\"", "I won't pontificate with a five page review. Simply put, if you have an original fatty or DS Lite, the upgrade is worth it. I don't have a DSi or the XL, and I don't know feature sets of those, other than the marketing materials, so I can't comment on them. I'm not the kind of person who reviews based on reading, I prefer to review based on actual usage.I won't bitch about the battery life, because that was a known issue even when the thing was announced. When available, I plan on getting the Nyko Power Pak+ for $20. Right now, it says the end of April.", "What can I say?  I love this freaking thing.  I had a ds lite and I basically played one game:  Mario kart.  That was it for the most part.  Even on that tiny screen, the graphics were pixelated.  Then I got a psp and the ds lite sat in a drawer for a year until I gave it to a friend's kid.  I felt that the original DS was a joke in all it's iterations.  This system is a HUGE improvement in every, way, shape, and form.SYSTEM:  It's portable, the hardware is a lot more solid than ds lite.  Sound is acutally pretty good but will pop if I accidentally slide the volume up to high.  3d toggle is a bit flimsy, the spotpass, streetpass, AR games, etc. are all nice icing on the cake but, nothing that really gets me excited.  The thumbstick is pretty awesome.3D: Let me start off by saying that I love the 3d technology and got hooked on it because of my EVO3d.  But, I hated trying to play games with onscreen gamepad.  I think that the 3d is better on the 3ds for games but, that just could be because of higher production value games being on the 3ds.  I have let's golf 2 for the phone and Let's golf 3d for 3ds.  The 3d is about equal for those games.  It's a really hard thing to decide which is 'better' as I have nothing to really judge.  I know that the EVO3d has much larger screen, much higher resolution, much better camera, and a MUCH higher overall price tag. The camera on the 3ds is very sick joke.  It's really bad in my eyes.  Great toy for kids I suppose.  The free 3d videos are nice too.  I don't think there is a way to save them though.VALUE: I bought the 3DS AFTER the price drop.  I feel that it's worth the current price tag.  I could care less about the non-3d games that don't take up the whole screen (The whole screen is small enough as it is) and I felt that $250 was way too much.  The fact that there are a few 3d games in the eshop for reasonable prices and more to come was ultimately what made me decide to buy the system.  $40 is a bit much for handheld titles in my book and $30 is too much for a remake.  Of my 6 games, 5 were $20 or less ( most from here on Amazon) and only one of those was used.  The fact that many people feel this way is good for owners of this system as developers will be forced to give us quality titles or lower the prices of the games.  I'd say overall that the 3ds is a good value.GAMES: Just OK.  There are only two titles that I'd even remotely consider paying the $40 for.  The both have Mario in the title and neither one is out.  Zelda, Ridge Racer, DOA, Lego games, etc.  Just a handful of games that I care for right now.  It will get better.  At least I hope.  For the eshop, what about  GBA or SNES titles at least?  I didn't buy a system with nice capabilities and 3d to play monoochrome screen games.Overall, I love it and have just a few complaints.  If the mario kart game lives up to the last one, It's almost worth it just for that game alone.", "\"I've been so excited, waiting for my 3DS. I wasn't exactly sure what the \"\"3D\"\" meant, but I wanted a lot of features from the DSi, but wanted to wait for the latest generation. Wow am I happy I did!Look and feel: First off, the console is beautiful! So many people say that it looks like \"\"cheap plastic\"\", I am left to wonder if they have even seen one. My family has 4 DS Lites, and this console makes them look like poor cousins (which I guess now they are). The 3DS feels well made. Some DS Lites had loose hinges, but my new 3DS isn't like that at all. My personal DS Lite was the best of our 4, but the 3DS feels even better. My only complaint on the feel side is the placement of the D-pad. I know they wanted to fit in the slide-stick, but the D-pad it just a bit harder to reach. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time, but it is still a \"\"first look complaint.\"\"3D: Of course this is the major selling point, and boy does it not disappoint! Even traditional 3D accelerated games feel flat after playing Ridge Racer 3D or Pilot Wings. Even the included \"\"AR Games\"\" are beautiful to look at. They are fun, but really short. I am betting we'll be seeing more \"\"AR\"\" type games for sale for the 3DS in the near future.Graphics in general: I have seen some side-by-side comparisons on other review sites, but I was still wondering just how good the graphics would be. I have no idea how they did it, but the graphics really are as good as you've seen on the web. While Pilot Wings is cartoony, they graphics are detailed even from a distance. Ridge Racer 3D had my jaw hitting the floor.Battery life: Well, I've seen people say that their 3DS shuts off after 1.5 hours. I haven't had that happen yet. I just plugged it in after 2 hours of Ridge Racer 3D and it was still going strong. We'll have to see how it takes a real marathon session of playing, or a car trip, which I guess are really the same thing, eh? The included cradle is really nice, but it is optional. You can still plug in the 3DS and play, no problem at all.Included games: Included is one AR Game card, and a game called Face Raiders. Both are really fun for a short period of time. The AR Game \"\"Archery\"\" is a blast, I just wish it was a LOT longer. Fishing is interesting. I guess if you're into that kind of game, you'll probably get a bit of enjoyment out of that as well. The 5 \"\"character cards\"\" aren't what I was hoping though. I was hoping for an AR Game staring Samus or Link, instead all you get is a posable virtual action figure. Face Raiders will definitely have you and your kids giggling for a while though. Play it and you'll see why!Disappointment: I am really only disappointed in the fact that the touted online support is currently \"\"Coming in a Future Update\"\". I've heard of all the cool things that DSi customers can get and about retro titles being updated for the 3DS. So far, none of this is available. Hopefully they won't leave us waiting too long.Overall: I am very glad I waited to upgrade my DS Lite. While I may still keep it around for a bit while I make sure all the games are truly 100% compatible, it will be slowly phased out and the 3DS will become my main handheld. It's built better, looks better, and the new games that come out for it will really look amazing!\"", "The Nintendo 3DS provides epic 3D without the need for special glasses. It looks simply amazing that it can't be described. It also comes preloaded with a lot of amazing software such as Face Raiders. It's the ultimate stress reliever for me since I'm able to shoot my brother's face on the go.", "so i bought this for my GF as a present having a purple one of my own i love the system only because of the elevated touch screen on the bottom it can scratche the top screen and there are reports of the L/R buttons breaking", "The DS has always been my favorite handheld system. The amount of fun games along with the dual screen innovation and touch controls made it one of the great systems of our time. Now, Nintendo has successor to this great system called the 3DS. The 3DS has revolutionized this already-great system and is a great addition to your gaming systems.1. HardwareThe reason the 3DS is called the 3DS, of course, is because of the new 3D effect. Nintendo has revolutionize 3D and has made it possible to see it without 3D glasses. This feature is both cool and somewhat dangerous. if you're 8 years old or under, you shouldn't use it at all. Otherwise, using it for two hours can still cause eye damage. This, however, can be avoided by turning it off. Of course, as cool as the 3D effect is, it's not exactly a down point that you can't use it too long. If you're shopping for a child, the better idea might be to get him/her a 2DS, which is the same thing without the 3D.Another new feature is the slide panel. Now if you're playing a behind-the-back game, you can move around with ease instead of having to use the directional pad. Also, there are new features such as StreetPass and Miiverse (which originated from the Wii U) that also add to the system's features.Otherwise, the hardware is very similar to that of the original DS. There are two screens and touch controls on the bottom screen. It also takes some of the features of the DSi. However, unlike the DSi, the 3DS has multiple great games to go with these features.2. GraphicsOne of the improvements on the 3DS is its graphics. The actual graphics are as good as that of a PS2 or Xbox, which is very cool for a handheld. Games like Kingdom Hearts 3D or Kid Icarus Uprising that look great and really show what this system can do. These games actually look better with the 3D effect. The effect adds a certain amount of depth that no other systems have. However, you have to be okay with it hurting your eyes the first few times.3. PowerLike the graphics, the 3DS has the capabilities of a sixth generation console. Once again, despite this being a lot smaller than the current consoles, this is very impressive for a handheld system. Whereas the DS could only handle the power of games such as Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks, the 3DS can fit the entire Ocarina of Time game.4. GamesThe 3DS, though its launch was a little slow, has a great selection of games. Some of the games I previously mentioned, Kingdom Hearts 3D, Kid Icarus Uprising, and Ocarina of Time 3D, are very good games, and are some of my favorites. Other great games include Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf.The VerdictAs much as I loved the DS, I like the 3DS a lot more. I really like the improvements and the games you can get on this system. I really think that this is the best handheld out there, and I would recommend this to any gamer on the go.", "\"I originally wrote a positive review of the 3DS because I was a fanboy and I felt lots of hype for the thing. The hype is totally gone and I was left with a terrible system. Luckily for me Nintendo refunded the thing once they heard that the 3D effect nukes my eyes, so I have $250. Because of the 3DS I'm not a mindless Nintendo fanboy anymore, I'm willing to give the competition a chance. Overall the 3DS has done more good to me than harm, I got all my money back and I'm freed from Nintendo's siren song. Yay! (Update: not actually free from their siren song, just bought a Wii... I guess \"\"once a fanboy, always a fanboy\"\" works with me)The reason for the negative review? The second 3DS slide pad add-on. It nearly doubles the size of the system, adds a few ounces to the weight, it takes a AAA battery to power and it should've come with the system from the start. Wait a year or two for the inevitable 3DS revision that comes with a second slide pad and a battery that lasts twice as long as the poor battery in the current 3DS model. The main reason Nintendo hasn't already released a revision is that they have to get rid of millions of systems before they can push out the revision model; they also don't want to piss off Ambassadors, but honestly Nintendo Ambassadors paid $250 to help Nintendo beta test a console release. In the words of the great Sonic the Hedgehog: That's no good!It has potential, but the current model is incomplete and flawed. Seriously, wait for the revision to get it or just go for a Vita, or just keep playing your DS systems during the wait for the revision model's release. Seriously, do not buy this incomplete, flawed 3DS model. It's very bad.\"", "Best handheld ever. I was contemplating if I should get the 2ds or 3ds, but I am glad I went 3ds. I was skeptical about the 3d switch and the price... but compared the 2ds the 3ds is much better.I mainly purchased this for: Pokemon y, Animal Crossing New Leaf, and Luigi's Mansion.Truth be told there are not a lot of games for Nintendo....Now for the Pros:- It folds!- There is a 3-d off switch!- Stylus is sooo classy:)Con:- It is heavier than the DS Lite.- Battery life: brightness and wifi does waste battery.- Stylus location: why at the top? Easier access would have been the same place as the DS Lite.Also note that it does take some time to get familiar with the 3ds. If you are playing regular ds games you will find yourself using both of the left-hand controls. I sometimes find myself wanting to go diagonally across the screen-- but then remember that you can only do that on 3ds games.. pity.", "\"Quick background:- I should open a video game museum as I own almost all incarnations of home/handheld consoles from the Atari to now.- I was a huge fan of the DSi- I play my DS an average of an hour to three hours a day, depending on the day.Quick summary:- It's a no-brainer, great buy if you are a fan of Nintendo/DS games.- If you're on the fence about this, I would still say it's worth a buy, and here's the reason why below.- The 3D effects are very cool.  Now I would like to point out that it's not going to be all about \"\"in your face\"\" effects that you see in some cheesy 3D movies, but rather many of the games emphasize the more subtle side of 3D, sort of like what you saw if you watched Avatar in 3D, where the background effects have depth and add a bit of realism to the environment. (Games like Pilotwings are a great example of this).- Will you get a headache?  It depends on the amount of eye strain you can handle.  It will take a moment to get adjusted to the 3D effect, but for me I was okay within a few minutes.  But I do recommend taking breaks as the eye strain for this is a bit more than your standard handheld.- You need to obviously focus on the \"\"sweet spot\"\" which is looking directly at the top 3D screen at a specific angle and distance.  If you're the kind of player that moves the DS around in your hand, you might find instances where you'll get disoriented.- The battery life is okay.  It wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be, but if you crank up the 3D effect and also use WiFi a lot, obviously it will drain a lot faster.- I like the fact you charge the 3DS on a nice cradle, which makes it easy.- The 3D camera is a nice fun gimmick.  I agree with other reviewers that these are not meant to replace real cameras, but I have to admit, I really like how you can take 3D photos and view them.  I thought it made the image feel more real and sort of helped me capture that mental moment in my head even better.- I like how it is backwards compatible with old DS games.  Bear one thing in mind, the aspect ratio of the bottom screen is different in the 3DS from the old DS.  If you want you can hold the Start and Select buttons while selecting the game from the 3DS menu to have it display in the correct aspect ratio.  However, it does make the image seem tiny, so it may be worth just playing your old DS games on your old DS itself.- The cost is a bit high, but still seems reasonable given the nice upgrades and the fact you're paying a premium to play on a device that offers something that isn't available elsewhere at the moment.- The games right now are okay, but in my opinion there aren't any killer, must-own launch apps that are in the market right now.  Yes I had fun playing PilotWings, Street Fighter, Lego Star Wars, Bubble Bobble etc, but in the end there's nothing there that's blowing my mind.  However, there are good games just around the corner like Zelda, so I don't think the situation is that bleak.Conclusion:- All in all a must get for Nintendo fans- Worth getting just so you can experience the fun of subtle 3D gaming- Battery life not awesome, but not as terrible as I thought.  Easy charging on a cradle is a plus.- Backwards compatibility with DS is good.- The device is comfortable to hold, and feels more substantial than the DSi.- It's a great device for kids, and lots of options for parents to control content is a huge plus.\"", "nintendo 3ds is the greatest portable game system in the world a true classic the best of the best all the 3ds games rock buy it you wont be sorry", "I just picked up my Aqua Blue 3DS and I am very pleased. The 3DS is not perfect by any means but I do think that it is a fine system so far. As I write this some features like Netflix are not available so I may come back and update this review when I can test these features out for myself.The system feels comfortable to hold in my hands. The size isn't too far off from the DSi. The color has a sort of metallic look to it that is very classy though I do wish that Nintendo had given us more colors to choose from. There will undoubtedly be more colors to choose from in the future though. The color isn't exactly an aqua blue, it is more of a bluish-green.The question that most of you probably have is whether or not the 3D effect works. Yes, it does but it will take some getting used to. Keep in mind that the 3D visuals depend on the system's camera to track your head and so you will need to look at the system from a specific point for the best results in 3D. It isn't that hard to keep your head in that spot but you may need some time to get used to this. The 3DS provides a glimpse into an actual game world so you are not just looking at 3D graphics, you can actually move the system and your view changes accordingly. For example, your character in the game may step into an in-game room and you can physically move your 3DS to the right and your view will shift as you move the system. It's a lot of fun and one of the included mini games will actually have you moving around your desk or kitchen table in order to look into a hole from the right angle.At first your eyes might feel a little buggy after playing with the 3D effects. That is normal but you should get used to it after a few plays. You can also adjust the intensity of the 3D effect with a little slider on the right side of the system and you can even do this in the middle of the game. I personally like the 3D effect to be a little under half power. That gives a nice bit of depth but the effect isn't overpowering. If you do not care for the 3D effects then you can simply turn that feature off and you still have a powerful little handheld system. This is good for people who do not enjoy 3D movies as they will still be able to play games on this system.In addition to the new 3DS games the system can play the older DS and DSi games already out there. In a couple of months Nintendo will be revealing an online shop where you can buy and download some of the original Gameboy and Gameboy Color games optimized for the 3D screen. This effectively means that the 3DS already has a library of thousands of games even before we get into the 3DS games. The 3DS does have some flash memory for storing downloaded games but you will probably want to use the SD memory card slot and store your games on your memory card.The 3DS does come with a 2GB SD card for saves and there are some applications already on it so you will have something to play right out of the box. There is a game where you can take pictures of yourself, your spouse, your pets or almost anything and attach the photos to flying enemies which you must then defeat. There is also a game that uses special paper cards. You put one of these cards on the table and look at it through the 3DS. You will see fun things happen like a hole open up in your table where a creature comes out and attack you or you can try another card to see characters pop up. Here is a tip, try downloading these cards from Nintendo's website and print them out on large sheets of paper. The size of the characters that come out are proportional to the size of the paper. A group of people in Japan strung together a massive square and made an avatar the size of a building!Did you know that you can set your 3DS to sleep mode and it will communicate with other 3DS systems? Let's say that you are on your lunch break from work and you head to the deli with your 3Ds in your messenger bag. The system will find other systems and communicate with them. If you have a game such as Street Fighter 4 there will even be a mini-battle and if you win you will win rewards.  The 3DS also has a pedometer so if you walk with it the system will track your footsteps and reward you with virtual coins you can use in certain applications.Is the 3DS worth $249? I think so because of all the existing games that can be played on it and Nintendo handhelds are always very well supported with a healthy game library. It will very likely be at least two years before Nintendo updates the 3DS hardware and I certainly do not want to wait that long to play these games. Even if 3D video games are just a fad the 3DS will still play great games in regular 2D graphics and I anticipate that this system will have a great run just like its predecessors.", "\"After enjoying the Nintendo DS line of handhelds way more than I'm comfortable admiting as an adult with a kid, I've been looking forward to the Nintendo 3DS.  The minor bump up in resolution was a disappointment when devices like the iPhone are showing off \"\"retinal displays,\"\" but the graphics are a huge step up; and, I think the new graphics capabilities of the 3DS should be the main selling point rather than the 3D effect.++Positives++In addition to a slightly better resolution and major Graphics upgrade, the 3DS sports a decent size, 3D-capable top screen (though still undersize compared to the excellent DS XL screens) and a familiar lower touch screen on par with the size of teh DS lite screen.  The LCD's are plenty bright, performing better against glare, while the new directional analog nub lends much needed versatility to the control scheme. The new Home, Select and Start buttons below the touch screen are the only part of the 3DS that feels cheap or slightly unresponsive.  In general, this handheld is built extremely well and should last years without major abuse.The 3D effect was immediately noticeable to me and easy to adjust into a comfortable, crisply clear virtual world.  Pilotwings makes excellent use of the 3D view and it becomes integral to playing the game.  The games I've played all looked great in 3D!--Negatives--The biggest negative (which I deducted a star for) is the headache people seem to get when playing.  After only about 5 minutes I could feel my head starting to hurt from the strain on my eyes.  It took over 2 hours for the headache to go away after my first 5-10 minute gaming mini-session.  I'll have to see if the headaches go away with more frequent playing.  It brought me back to the nauseau I got from first playing first-person games with 3 dimensions like Descent for the PC way back when.  The only other significant negative is a short battery life (though I usually play with brightness turned down and sound off, which extends battery life).Also, the games out now are not that great, yet they're are all priced at $39.99 retail.  Street Fighter is the only one I would pay full retail price for.  Nintendogs seems like a quality game and I imagine fans of previous Nintendogs titles will be thrilled with it.  The games roster currently offers little else.  Pilotwings is decent as is Madden, but they seem more like quick ports than full-fledged 3DS blockbuster titles.  Most of the games out are not even worth playing and do little with the new graphics and 3D capabilities.==Conclusion==Overall, the Nintendo 3DS is a graphical powerhouse compared to the previous DS models. When games are released that are really tailored to the 3DS, it will become a must-have system regardless of the discomfort that the 3D effect can have.  Until then, I recommend finding a demo model to see how you like the 3D effect and how much of a headache it gives you.  However, even without the 3D turned on, the graphics are amazing and Nintendo's first party titles will be sure to make this another must-have entertainment device, just like the Wii and DS.\"", "I love the 3ds.  It has so many great games and features.  There are a few things you should know before purchasing that I didn't know and wish I had.  The screen is small.  If you have bad eyes, you'd be better off with the XL.  The 3d is stereoscopic.  That means the 3d effect comes from one eye seeing one thing and the other eye seeing something else.  They both see the same thing on the screen, but from different points of view.  Having two eyes working on different things at the same time might give you a headache.  If you have migraines like I do, I would ease into it gradually.  Also having astigmatism might make the headache worse. Even if you are perfectly healthy, I recommend easing into the 3d effect as it can be overwhelming at first.  It's all really a gimmick anyway.", "\"This is the gaming console that you've been waiting for a long time.We have played with Nintendo game systems for many years starting with the color Game Boy and finally advancing to the DSi and now the 3DS.It is a lot of money to put out for a new system but Nintendo has packed a whole ton of new features into this little portable system.The 3D is amazing, everything you could image it to be and more. You have to be looking at it pretty straight on and about 12-14\"\" from your face or the 3D gets difficult to keep clear. You have the ability at all times to turn off the 3D with a slider switch on the side of the top screen. Beyond the 3D there is added gyro feature that moves the system control as you move the 3DS from side to side.The controls are smooth and include the new joystick, the + bar,the A,B,Y,Z buttons, L/R buttons and a set of three button at the bottom including select, home and start. You can use a stylus (a much shorter version from the DS but one that telescopes out if you pull on it, it fits from the top down so it is no larger that the vertical height of the DS, not the longer width.) The touch screen is very sensitive and for screen controls and getting around menus, you don't need the stylus.We have set up our WiFi account but it says that you cannot connect to the internet yet and prompts that a software update will be available to enable that feature.Since we had a ton of downloaded games on the DSi, I'm still not sure if those will be downloadable again onto the new system (at no added expense.) I've read that you can though. My son was leery to trade in his DSi for this reason but I'm sure there is a workaround.You can play your regular DS games on it but your Game Boy games will not fit. However, many of those titles will be available for download once the internet connection is up and running.There are games that come preloaded that show off the 3D capabilities. One of them is Face Raiders which allows you take a picture of someone, or yourself, and then the game morphs that face into your enemy that you have to pop with balls to eliminate. It is really funny to play and the faces become these odd caricatures of the original picture. All the time you are playing, the DS displays whatever is directly in front of you as the backdrop to the game.Which brings up the ability for this console to take 3D photos. There are two cameras on the outside that can take a live shot in 3D. There is an additional camera that points to the player. You can switch between those cameras to change what the DS is taking a shot of.There is an SD card slot already loaded with a card. The overall feel of the console is sleek and easy on the hands, not much bigger than the DS or DSi in fact it feels about the same weight. It doesn't charge directly with a corded charger but it sits on a charging dock while the dock is plugged in. It doesn't really stay tightly to the dock but I guess you wouldn't want too much resistance or it will eventually break from being pulled out.A great system that really adds so much visually to the gaming experience.\"", "\"When I was looking to upgrade (I had a DSi and PSP, which I still have the PSP) I thought, the Vita, without a doubt... at first. I loved the idea of the 3G version (50 bux more than the standard and the option to buy a data plan at anytime and that gives me the ability to play online anywhere without a WiFi connection at my discretion, without committing to any contract, which the 3DS obviously does not have. I liked the idea of a PSP upgrade with a touchscreen, too - no longer would the Nintendo DS systems be the only handhelds to have a touch screen. I also liked the idea of being able to skype on the Vita (you can voice chat on the 3DS but not video... you can also voice skype on the original PSP as a side note, but you have to buy the additional remote for the headset... I think there may be a way to video chat on PSP if you're a good hacker and buy the PSP camera as there isn't a built in camera on the PSP, but I digress). I liked that the VITA bordered an iPhone in terms of available downloadalbe apps. The 3G version has two memory cards, the 8 gig it comes with that is like the PSP one, and an extra SD card on the 3G version. The capabilities graphics-wise rival that of the Playstation 3, and to me, the whole 3D thing was gimmicky, even after I tried it... I wasn't impressed. The price was obviously a huge difference after Nintendo lowered the MSRP, but to me it was worth it, and a no brainer.I did some more thinking, however, and the 3DS began to become the more appealing system, for me personally, anyway.3DS PROS OVER THE VITA: It plays all of your DS games, which is a plus. The Vita does not support the PSP UMDs, which include video discs - the solution is that you can download most PSP games, as well as videos however, if you trade in your PSP, you're having to pay again to have those games and videos, and not all of them are supported. Another option/solution is to keep your PSP of course, which I was going to do if I got the Vita because I felt I had invested too much into it (not only in games, videos, downloads, but also accessories like an expensive headset, case, video component cables to play on TV and watch my UMD videos on TV... I don't own a PS3, I'm a handheld only gamer, so, another reason this is sort of a personalized choice)And here is a big one - NEW game support... so far, the 3DS has the Vita beat... granted, it had a head start (and it actually was a little slow going and many wondered if the support would turn out to be poor for the3DS, but now it's picked up and looking good). Regardless of the 3DS's headstart the Vita has been out for awhile and I'm not seeing the support I thought I would. Yes, you can download all the PSP games, PS classics, etc., but you can do that on the PSP, too. As far as new game support, the Vita is really lacking so far and given the time it's been out I think there should be more... we can only hope it picks up, as I said, the 3DS had a slow start, too. The 3DS has new and classic downloadable options, too - I'll discuss that under the VITA as well. I'm really pleased with the classic NES and SNES games they've chosen to release for download, too... games like Punch Out, Metroid, Zelda, Super Mario Bros., etc. etc., and some awesome titles that aren't as \"\"high profile\"\" like the original Kid Icarus and Bionic Commando - both awesome games. The 3DS has 2 screens, a touch screen and a top screen, which is really a personal \"\"pro,\"\" as many may prefer the one larger screen of the Vita. Though no 3G, the 3DS offers the cool street pass/spot pass feature (which works with games and videos), which the vita has a version of that is not nearly as good.Obviously, the 3DS has the 3D, no glasses needed technology. Though I'm basically a proponent for the 3DS in this review, I have to admit, I find it a little gimmicky and have not seen it used in any really cool ways except to give me a headache.Also, the 3DS is a sturdy machine... The DS lite or DSi didn't feel flimsy, but the 3DS is solid... it feels like if you dropped it (I don't recommend of course) it would withstand the force. It's nice for your gadgets to feel well built. It comes with a cool docking station for charging, although you can also charge directly, and I didn't have to buy a new carrying case for it, it fits nicely in my DSi one, though I did purchase a hardshell cover (the DSi covers will obviously not fit the 3DS).The camera's have more functionality/can do more on the 3DS than on the VITA, as it has three, an inner and 2 outer which allow you to take \"\"3D\"\" pics and videos. Pretty cool.VITA PROS OVER THE 3DS: However... I give Sony kudos for not rushing to get their system out pre-holiday just to make the money, and I know if I had bought the 3DS when it first came out at 300 bucks, I would be P.O.'ed and probably feel like I should have waited and either got the Vita with its perks for that price, or waited until the 3DS price went down by over 130 dollars and bought it then HAD I KNOWN - I don't blame a lot of people for feeling had - I don't know if Nintendo shamefully planned it that way (i.e. got the consumers before the holiday at a higher price because they knew they'd pay it since it was the only new \"\"hot\"\" handheld on the market and available for Christmas gifting, then lowered the MSRP when the Vita came out to have a price based competitive edge)... it could be, but it also could be that it wasn't selling well enough and they realized a drop in price was necessary.... I haven't done enough economic research to have insight into their motives. Regardless, I'd feel duped if I had bought it early at full price.Anyway, the Vita has the edge on online gaming given the 3G data plan option (although the 3DS does have the cool street pass element, as did the DSi, and you can online game with the 3DS via its own wifi), and the 3G Vita system is worth it for $50 more if you ever want to use that feature. The Vita is on top graphically (though the 3DS in my opinion is still a nice system with some decent specs in this respect, but to me, the \"\"3D\"\" thing is still a gimmick and not really that much of a pro for 3DS), and finally the Vita is also on top regarding non-gaming functions/apps - especially Skype is a big plus in my opinion - I figure though, if you have an iPhone or an Android, which have come way down in price and a lot more folks can afford them, although its nice to have them on say a Vita, you really don't need to have a lot of the apps on your handheld portable game system that you probably already have on your phone with a data plan (which have also become more reasonable in price and sometimes included in certain packages). Again, the Vita blows the 3DS away in apps though... I downloaded a cool metronome app and a guitar/instrument tuner on my 3DS, the browser app comes standard, but most of the additional apps available are calender type things and apps that enhance the camera abilities more... If you want apps on your portable gaming system, Vita all the way. The Vita has more downloadalbe games, but, like I mentioned before, right now most of those games are the same games that you can download and play on the PSP, so, if you hold on to your PSP like I have, you can get those same PS classics and PSP games that are the majority of what is available for download on the Vita, currently.Video wise, both have Netflix app. However, as far as watching downloaded via, say, for instance, videos you put on your SD card, the VITA has the 3DS blown away, so, if you want to use your handheld to watch videos outside of Netflix, Vita is the one. Even the older PSP is great for watching videos outside of just the UMDs - you can download videos from Playstation Network for cheap prices (all kinds of stuff) for both PSP and Vita, and you can also put them on your SD card for view. There are way more videos available for download via the Playstation Network than the 3DS, and with the 3DS, there is really nothing except videos about gaming. Also, you can't put videos on your SD card and watch them (*exception: there are some PC apps available to reformat, for instance, AVI files, to put on your SD card and make them playable on the 3DS. So far, though, as far as my research goes, they cannot exceed 10 minutes in length... so, no movies, not even a full TV episode. The SD card that comes with the 3DS is only 2 Gigs. You can get a larger one but that doesn't get around the 10 minute thing. So the only option for videos on the 3DS is Netflix, videos up to 10 minutes if you go through the reformatting trouble, and dumb video game video downloads... I've heard of a hack to watch YouTube videos via the Internet connection despite no Flash support (read on) but haven't figured it out yet). Also, and this is pretty big, the Vita's browser supports Flash, the 3DS does not. So, little to no video support (unless its an animated GIF, I suppose) on the browser. A big mistake, in my mind, on Nintendo's part... I mean, how hard would it had been to program in a browser that supports flash?? Ridiculous. Included in the apps that the Vita has and the 3DS doesn't is a simple MP3 player. You can't really use the 3DS as a music player - even the original PSP can be used as an MP3 player and depending on your SD card size hold tons of songs.COMPARABLE FEATURES: Some ways in which the Vita and the 3DS are comparable are both systems have WiFi ofcourse, offer Netflix, both have comparable cameras (the 3DS has three cameras, two outer, one inner: one of the outer is for taking \"\"3D\"\" photos and video, so you can capture both photos and video on the 3DS with a firmware update for the video, and apps, mini games and purchasable games take advantage of the 3D camera, so the 3DS actually has the Vita here). The Vita also captures photos and video and has a photo and video editor app. As far as the internet browser, both have a comparable one, outside of the lack of any Flash capability on 3ds's Linux based one. They both have portable storage via SD cards. Both have touch screens. Both systems come with the circle pad above the cross pad - the Vita has two, one left and one right, but there is an available accessory for the 3DS that adds the circular controller on the right.FINAL TAKE ON 3DS versus VITA: For me, it was a highly personal choice in terms of what I wanted out of a handheld system. The 3DS, at a much cheaper price, has good and seemingly growing game support, downloadable games which include classics (Punch Out and Metroid on a handheld... how awesome is that for the old school gamer?!), has the apps I want, like Netflix and a browser, voice recorder, and other cool stuff (like the instrument tuner for my guitar) with the exception of skype that the Vita has, which I would have liked but can do on my Android with my free data plan. It also had the functions I wanted - a camera capable of taking video and photos and a video editor app, an SD card for storage so I can, for instance, transfer those photos and video over to my PC. I was able to trade in my DSi since it plays all the DS games, and since I went the 3DS route, I kept my PSP which, as I mentioned before has a good number of the functions that the VITA offers (I'm not saying the Vita isn't a huge upgrade from the PSP, I was just recapping things stated before... e.g. that I can still download PSP and classic games on the PSP, and as another recap I'm also still able to play my UMD discs on something). No Flash player on the browser on 3DS is plain lame, and the lack of video support on the 3DS stinks, but I can watch videos on my PSP, and use Netflix on the 3DS... as well as watch videos on my phone with a 32 gig SD card. The cameras, again, have more functionality on the 3DS. Worst 3DS cons (for me): No Flash support (What?!), terrible video support, and no skype despite having 3 stinking cameras, and no MP3 player which can be found on both the PSP and Vita! Let's just hope Nintendo steps up and offers an upgrade that will offer a skype app since its got all the hardware, as well as a flash upgrade to offer more video support, and perhaps even a mp3 app.3DS CONCLUSION: Despite some negative reviews, I think the 3DS is good system. It's not a gigantic leap from the DSi, but when you weigh the price and the features, the 3DS is a nice overall value. Its 3D capabilities may be a little disappointing, but I think it makes up for it in new games and other features, such as the 3D camera, Netflix etc. As an RPG buff, I'm just hoping for some more support there, esp. turn based.\"", "My son wanted a 3DS.  He had a DSi XL so I was contemplating whether to let him trade that toward a 3DS.  I just was not sure it would perform even though I have never went wrong with a Nintendo handheld.  But, decided to let him do it and I would pay the difference since he met the condition of all A's in his classes and his birthday is coming up.  So we went to pick it up today and all I can say is WOW.  The 3D is excellent.  It really looks like some things are sticking out of the screen and some are back in the screen.  We purchases Super Street Fighter IV 3D edition and the whole this was great.  The controls are spot on and easy to use and again, the 3D is just great.  We are now looking forward to Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, Star Fox, Paper Mario, Super Mario, Resident Evil and Splinter Cell.I may actually buy me one to play and I usually do not play handhelds much.  In fact the last game I played on a handheld was the first Golden Sun.Pro's:Unit Looks and feels greatAnalog stick works greatButtons work greatScreens look greatVery easy to useCon's:Lack of second analog stick (this is just a wish of mine for handhelds)", "so this is worth it for 169.99.I never own a DSI so not like I wasted my money on every new model that comes out.The reason I rate so high is because you have to think about the future. No new games are coming out on the old ds anymore.With games like Zelda and animal crossing only being available for 3ds, plus the low low low price this is a steal.I admit I dont use the 3d feature much and the games they have right now in the VC sucks. I also dont use the online functions . Well because I own a iphone and ipad so really no need. But if you want to use it for that you can. the internet works off your home wifi kind of like your wii do. also haa a MP3 player and a free 2gb sd card. The battery life is really poor. i was charging every 3 or 4 hours and I was playing a 2d game(pokemon black).but like I said think for the future all the hot new games will be on this.so its worth getting for 170 but not 240 so buy this NOW.", "When it has came down to video games in all, no one has ever duplicated the influence, and dynamic gameplay that Nintendo has shown over the years. They have hit it big over 25 years since they came around making the original NES system, and they are hitting it out of the ballpark again. WIth the success around the Nintendo DS since the system came around in 2004, it has really changed the way we play video games on the go, and has shown with a simple touch, we can score big against Bowser in New Super Mario Brothers, we can sharpen our minds in Brain Age, and even more joy with it. Yet when Nintendo came around with the DSi a couple of years ago, it also borrowed some great pages from the Wii, and how we can get original fun all in just a simple video game download. Yet, that incarnation of the DS was actually fun, yet somehow deeply overshadowed. Now, they are about to take on the next dimension, and honestly it is worth the money.The all-new Nintendo 3DS, brings in more fierceness and excitement that we all have loved from the Nintendo DS, into the next dimension. It looks absolutely great, and improves greatly in so many ways from the feel of the Nintendo DSi top to bottom by not just the touch, but the gameplay as well. The system has so many features on it, whether it is playing 3DS games on a AR card, like thehands on game targets, which absolutely looked bold and vivid, as you try to shoot and score against bulls-eyes and a eye-popping dragon. All of that through the vivid eyes on a AR card, or great games like the simple Pilotwings Resort, where you can fly your way to the highest of ranks all in a simple hang glider or rocket pack. It is also really strong in backwards gameplay with the original Nintendo DS era.It also improves greatly in compatability from the DSi, so you can easily transfer those titles you've downloaded from the Nintendo DSi and also store new ones in the system through the e-shop. Whether it is downloading DSi favorites like Art Style: Base 10, or getting the feel of experiencing classic from the original Game Boy era, where you can download classics like Super Mario Land. It handles well in that, and also in music playback. Now, you can include and playback your favorite MP3 music downloads whether it is from Rhapsody or Amazon in a simple SD Card. A really great improvement from the DSi, where you were limited to having music playback only in the AAC format (mostly found in Itunes.) What I also like about it is also the enhanced gameplay with others, even on-the-spot when you duking it out in games like Super Street Fighter IV via streetpass. It really is very exciting.Yet, with all the enhancements that Nintendo has brought into the 3DS, there are a few faults, but minor ones for the system. The main one is really the battery life. It has a bit lower battery life in the system, for every time you need to recharge it. Unlike the Nintendo DS Lite or DSi, you only have a battery life that does last around 8 hours, for every charge you make into it, and a longer charging time too. Which can lead to some gamers wanting to just get a bit frustrated, waiting for it to fully charge for nearly 4 hours, and then take it on the go. But those are very small complaints about the system.Through it all, The Nintendo 3DS is a great buy top to bottom for any die hard Nintendo fan. I had a lot of fun trying it out, and I was absolutely impressed with the gameplay. It really takes on a whole new life, and everything we all love about the Nintendo DS into the next dimension of fun. I really recommend it a whole lot in gameplay & fun. Whether it is in blue or vivid black for your choice, you really do get what your buying in the Nintendo 3DS. If you've loved the original DS over the years, it is time to step into that next level of fun with the Nintendo 3DS and be blown away.Graphics: ASound: AGameplay: A-Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: ACompatability with DS & DSi: A-Price: B+Overall: A-", "If you've had a DS before you know exactly what you're getting into.The 3DS is a solid piece of hardware with few technical hickups and some really nifty features.  The games are coming slowly and it's definitely helping the console get up there.My only gripe involves the Augmented Reality. And it's not that I don't like it - the fact is I Love it, and it presents awesome possibilities for this handheld... unfortunately it doesn't extend beyond basically the the cards that come with the console and that face game.I have been very excited about the Vita's launch games because so many of them work with the AR.  I want to see the 3DS utilize this functionality more but no new games have even been announced yet.That's all though.  Otherwise the console is cool, the camera is awesome, the 3D effect is very solid, the content is pretty extensive (even without many great games, you'll have at least 2 new videos to watch every week in 3D for free).I recommend it if you're looking for a hand-held.  I won't say it's better or worse than the upcoming Vita, I plan on having both, and I plan on utilizing both for their exclusives and strengths.", "After buying all the DS variations in the past (besides DSI XL) I decided to take the plunge and pick this version up. It has great backwards compatibility with all the DS games working on it, along with some good games out so far, it's the ultimate version of the DS.Backwards compatibility:So far all the DS games I have played on this game work with the Nubstick and the D-pad. The Nubstick only moves in four directions like the D-pad, but I find it more comfortable that working with the D-pad, and since the D-pad is located below it, you can tell they wanted people to use the Nubstick over it. 3D is turned off automatically for obvious reasons.When you load a DS game it plays it a bit stretched on the top to a bigger square than the native DS resolution (Not full screen though, left and right have black bars but it's not noticeable) and the bottom is stretch the entire square, and the touch controls work just fine and I didn't notice anything wrong with them even though its stretched.You can also hold Start + Select when you load a DS game to play in the native resolution of the game, which plays them in a really small square in both the touch screen and top screen. The touch screen works with the smaller screen as well, but with at least 358/2 days I was able to control the camera past the screen size in the black areas, so this might affect DS games that rely on precise touch screen controls.While it stretches the DS games, I only noticed minor pixelations that were noticeable but didn't take away from the games. I prefer playing the games in the stretch mode, and even the originally DS didn't have the native resolutions the games were made in, so those are stretched as well. Since all the DS games work with the Nub stick, I think this is the best version of the DS to play DS games on. They even included the original DS wifi setup, so that you can play online with your DS titles as well.Hardware:The 3DS has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel like it will break any time soon. All the parts of the 3DS are fingerprint magnets, with no 3DS option out there so far with a matte finish, so you will be wiping your 3DS a lot. The stylus has gotten an upgrade; the stick part pulls out in a longer stick and is metal now. The tip still is rubber plastic, so you won't scratch your screens. It folds up into a smaller version and is stored in the top bottom part of the DS now, and is near the game slot.Just like the DSI you can add a SD memory card and the 3DS comes with a 2 GB card for free. With this you can add music to the 3DS, download the official emulator games on the marketplace, along with all the new features to the 3DS that I will talk about shortly. Unlike the Vita, the memory cards are not proprietary. So you can buy a cheap 32 GB micro SD card, get and adapter for it and use that, instead of being forced to pay 100 dollars if you want a 32 GB's. If you want to transfer music or other things to the DS, your computer will need a SD memory card slot since the 3DS doesn't have any USB connection. Unfortunately most games still only keep games saves on the 3DS cartridges, and not save to the memory card.You can charge the 3DS on both a cord like the DS and GBA chargers, or you can put it in a cradle where you put the cord into. The cradle itself allows you to just set the 3DS in it and charge away. The cradle is pretty cool since the 3DS just slides into it, without having to hook anything up directly to the system, just the charger dock.The 3DS comes with three camera ports. The rear facing camera has two slots since it can take 3D pictures. It isn't the best quality out there, but it is nice to have just in case you need it. The 3D pictures are cool, but will only be viewable in 3DS itself. Along with that, you can take capture AR pictures for various games and software titles and augmented reality cards. The front facing camera isn't the greatest quality as well, and is really only used for games that capture your face.The headphone jack is on the bottom of the DS now (where the GBA slot was), which makes for more comfortable gaming experience when you're playing with headphones on. Like the previous DS's, they also have a microphone slot for games which require you to talk into. It also spins the icons at the main menu when you blow into it. The battery life is pretty low though, running at 3-6 hours depending on settings and if you're using 3D or not. They do have a battery saving mode and you can reduce the brightness for longer battery life.Software:A web browser has been added as well, and actually works pretty well. It doesn't have flash built in, but the sites do load pretty fast and can switch through multiple tabs and zoom in with the touch screen. Just like a regular browser you can save favorites and it saves cookies on your system for sites you visit often.The store application allows us to finally be able to download DS games through wifi now. They currently have RE: Revelations and MGS:3 as the main demos, but they only have 30 uses each. You can also download a bunch of free applications as well. Netflix is available, but you need an active subscription for it and I think in the future they will have 3D titles available to watch.A 3D pokedex is free to download as well, and you can unlock new pokemon through the AR reader and reloading it every day. A free 3D note writer is downloadable as well, and it works with streetpass with other people. A video player can be downloaded as well, and it updates every week with 4 videos during that week that range from random videos to music videos. They are all in 3D.All the DSi-ware games are downloadable on the 3DS and they have been releasing Gameboy games with the built in emulator they have. This could lead to GBA games being purchasable; I personally would love to be able to buy the older pokemon games for the 3DS. NES and Gamegear have emulator games downloadable in the store, which could lead to so many other systems getting an emulator for the 3DS.Setting up wi-fi is really easy this time around, even if you have a WPA-key router. I didn't have to set up the ip address and the other settings for the 3DS wifi (Had to do this for the DS wifi settings since it still messes up) and this is a nice relief with a bunch of wireless games coming to the 3DS. I haven't noticed any lag so far for multiplayer gaming.Streetpass is something new they added with 3DS, which is a wireless function that interacts with other peoples 3DS when you go past them. This could range from trading Ghost racing data in Mario Kart, to trading notes you set up to send to other people. It has a pretty far range as well (I live near a road, and left my 3DS on and got some people with streetpass that drove past my house) and it's a pretty cool way to interact with other random people.Verdict:I know I talked a lot in this review, but I wanted to cover as much as I could during the course of this review. The 3D effects are really cool in all the menus and applications you can get and if most games are going to be like Mario Kart 7's 3D effects, I am really looking forward to the future of this system. Definitely not a DS I will sell anytime soon and I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap portable system, especially if you haven't had a DS before. Also Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance coming out for this doesn't hurt either.~ Written: April, 2012Positives:* Great backwards compatibility that is actually improving over the original DS* Upgraded stylus* Browser is well made to the 3DS* Better spot for a headphone jack* DSi-ware works* Gameboy, NES and gamegear emulator* Wifi is finally easy to set up* Game time tracking in daily, monthly and yearly segmentsNegatives:* Not the greatest camera* Semi low battery life", "Unlike so many electronic devices nowadays, this 3DS comes with a printed manual (thank you, Nintendo!). My child may know how to use this thing, but I want to know what it's capable of (i.e., what I need to be concerned about him accessing) without mucking around.PARENTAL CONTROLSMy primary concern was the recent warning about use of the 3DS on the eyes -- it's not recommended for under age 7 and for not for a prolonged period of time. I wanted to limit my son's use of the 3D element.Nintendo did take that concern into account. It not only allows parents to lock their kids out of the 3D component, they can also control their children's access to the following:- software rating- internet browser- shopping service- sharing images, audio, videos- online interaction- StreetPass- friend registration- DS download playParents control the content with a PIN. If we lose that PIN, we can unlock it using the secret question. If we forget the answer to that question, then we need a master key, which we obtain by calling Nintendo. How easy it is to do that, I don't know. It could be a loophole savvy kids use to work around the controls.FUN EVEN WITHOUT NEW GAMESMy second concern was we weren't buying new games, at least not for awhile. Would this 3DS be any fun without new games?My son says yes. He can play his old Nintendo Lite games on the system, but he hasn't done that yet. He's too busy exploring all the other features:- 3DS Camera: take 3D photos- 3DS Sound: listen to music or record sounds- Mii Maker: create Mii characters from scratch or from photos- AR Games: aim the 3DS camera at the mystery cards and characters pop out. My son aimed his 3DS at one of his cards and played a fishing game, pulling up on his 3DS like a fishing pole. The 3DS is motion sensitive, like holding a Wiimote. Pretty cool.- Face Raiders: place photos of your faces into the characters and play a shooting game.- Activity Log: check play times and use the 3DS as a pedometer.- eShop: we aren't going to use this, but we can download games into the 3DS.FINAL THOUGHTSI don't know about anyone else, but the 3D effect gives me a serious headache. All I see is double, and I tried moving the screen and adjusting the effect. The only time it looks right is when I've got the slider all the way down, meaning the 3D is turned off. I've placed limits on my son's 3D usage, but that hasn't been a problem for him. He has been having a blast with this new toy.", "Hello I'm an autistic adult gamer.This is my review on the Nintendo 3ds.Well I bought this from best buy on pre-order because of the warranty reason's as in 2 year warranty plus I'm a gamer.  Anyway's I just upgraded from the original nintendo dsi (not the dsi xl) fyi I'm keeping my original dsi for only a couple of reason's which will be further discussed in this review.My 2 reason's for keeping my original dsi:1. Dsiware2. Camera ModeAnyway's the above 2 follow with the 3ds as in transfering dsiware to 3ds in may & quite frankly the camera mode on the 3ds it's not as good as I expected the camera mode on the original dsi as far as pictures go the pic's are more sharp & clear on the 3ds there worse than a polaroid camera oh wait the good thing on the 3ds the pic's come out in color big whoop.  Not impressed.My only real complaint about the 3ds is the camera mode.I did try the 3d part on my blue 3ds for a couple of minutes & it made me dizzy.As far as playing import ds games on the 3ds I have 8 european import ds games but decided to try only 3 of them out on my 3ds:Casper's Scare School:  Classroom Caper's dsCasper's scare School:  Spooky Sport's Day dsHello Baby - dsThey all work on the 3ds fine & I did call nintendo up & ask about import ds games they said if you have a import ds game & it worked on your dsi then it should play fine on the 3ds & in which case there right because 3 of my import ds games work on my 3ds.I'm going to leave the 3d part off on my 3ds & still play 3ds & ds games just not interested in the 3d part I bought my 3ds for the new ds games & other features like the virtual console not the 3d part.One peice of really cool info as far as sd cards go I took my old 8 gig sd card out of my dsi & put it in my 3ds & could listen to music & stuff that was already on my 8 gig sd card which is nice.  Oh the 3ds fit's nice in my old dsi my baby carrying case & also in my lilo & stitch dsi carrying case so very happy going to use my my baby carrying case for my 3ds.Overall I really like the 3ds not much more to say I tried out the card thingy's were you put it in front of the 3ds it's fun.Just make sure if your going to get this system get the warranty with it.  Just my 2 cent's.Happy Gaming! (^_^)", "Still getting used to it, but it is very cool and top of the line for a handheld game, as nintendo always is.", "\"Portable gaming by nintendo has been way behind the other systems entirely. This thing is low tech and nintendo needs to step up the technology so that they can offer something to compete with the  PSP VITA, heck even the psp is still ahead of the 3ds. Metal Gear solid 3 is \"\"3D\"\" on the 2ds. Get this, that game came out for the ps2 7 years ago. Nintendo fans deserve more than this hand me down crap. I had the original game boy in the 90s when they sold it as big as it was in the box for 60 dollars. Back then the portable was up to date, but as time went on nintendo got lazy as hell.GET THE VITA it is WAY ahead of the 3DS, play PS3 quality games portable. Nuff Said!well theres more, one commenter was spitting fire with the TRUTH read this :)Couldn't agree more, the 3DS is indeed low-tech junk. Everything about the system reeks of cheapness and cut corners. Tiny upper screen, low resolution, only one analog nub, terrible cheap d-pad, unimpressive selection of games, and worst of all: the total reliance on the 3D gimmick to sell the system. Nintendo has been all about gimmicks for 10 years now, just look at the Wii and you can see the biggest example. They can't compete in terms of design, manufacture, and technology, so they throw in cheap gimmicks to sell their stuff. I gave up on Nintendo over a decade ago; still have all the older systems and love them (NES, SNES, N64, GBASP), but starting with the Gamecube Nintendo has just been all about cheap JUNK.\"", "Nintendo did it again. They release the best video game consoles and specially video games handhelds. I worn you. this thing can be addicted, so you have to find time or otherwise it will take all the time you have. Too many great games on the 3DS. Best one is Pokemon XY for me", "nintendo as a company has really gone downhill these last couple of years. there biggest games are still the old mario/zelda kinds of games that have been reused to the point of abuse. I can't think of anything new that they have done that even compares to how good they used to be. So you are better off getting a sony vita for better games coming in the future, or better yet get a ps4.I hope i helped.", "The 3D effect is great. It comes with some drawbacks, however. You have to keep the 3DS perfectly centered. A slight tilt to the left or right causes the 3D effect to disappear and you begin seeing overlapping figures. This is particularly noticeable on a game like Ridge Racer, where you tend to move the 3DS around while playing. I'm not sure why they put the motion control sensing in the device--it's completely unusable with the 3D on."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05375775694847107, 0.005919917952269316, 0.06393816322088242, 0.056030236184597015, 0.03265586122870445, 0.006340703461319208, 0.05919375270605087, 0.07312291115522385, 0.013528933748602867, 0.06836576759815216, 0.027219463139772415, 0.03495269641280174, 0.001592008862644434, 0.03816107288002968, 0.0392235592007637, 0.0022014316637068987, 0.008402971550822258, 0.023094775155186653, 0.037861187011003494, 0.05811609327793121, 0.026887638494372368, 0.045053258538246155, 0.025387858971953392, 0.03165903687477112, 0.07290276139974594, 0.0007963924435898662, 0.04239838942885399, 0.018947390839457512, 0.03228802978992462]]}
