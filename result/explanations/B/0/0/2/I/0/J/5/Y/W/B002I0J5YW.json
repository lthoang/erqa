When I first started playing it I played it for hours and beat it multiple times. I would recommend it.", "70+ hours over 3 months period. That's what the game gave me as a summary report when I finished the game - once. I've only sporadically played games throughout my life. My recent playing has all been FPS or action games in straight campaign linear mode to get through-and-move on. ME2 is a role playing game that needs to build up a team and build royalty while excavate minerals. The game like this usually turn me off after few hours as I refuse to put so much time in it (Dead Island for example). But this game is highly addictive, and I keep coming back to play. It was worth the money for sure.The only thing I find repetitive (but still wanting to do) is mining all the planets for minerals. This at the end wasn't necessary for 3 out of the 4 elements. The mining probably took me a good 1/4 of the time. I give 4 (instead of 5) stars for fun because of this time waster. In Me3 they simplify this which is good.The other complaint is the reloading time after getting killed. It can take up to 30 seconds to restart a section each time, which is a real downer. I have a 7200RPM hard drive and it's a real drainer. I strongly suggest using one of the faster SSDs if you want to play at more difficult level to deal with the slow reloading time.This edition comes with most of the DLC content, so lots to explore. That's a huge value! I think there is only one DLC that is not part of this and can be downloaded separately.My only major complaint is loading time after getting killed. Typically can be 20-30 seconds. On some very challenging battles, the loading-before-restarting can really drag the gaming session on. (I have a 7200RPM HDD, and may need to try SSD)All in all, it was a GREAT game that really had an effect on my work productivity and cut into my sleep time!", "Awesome game!  Everything about this game is brilliant. Great character development and story. Thank you Bioware for all the added bonus content.  This is one of the best games I've ever played period!  Can't wait for Mass Effect 3 to come out.", "I think the title sums it up. You play as the commander on a mission to save everybody. Yes it's a huge job but you and your hand picked team can handle it. Mass Effect 2 is a deep story driven shooter, with a bit of rpg leveling up. As you travel you build a relationship with those on your team, the closer you are the better.Not many game offer the deep story, solid combat, rpg leveling, all in one package and pull it off.  Well Mass Effect 2 does and it's worth playing.  Get it and enjoy some of the best gaming has to offer!", "Every generation of game consoles has its defining titles. When one thinks back on a system and its legacy, an association with those games is often made. For instance the NES and SNES eras gave us Super Mario Bros. and Zelda, while the original PlayStation served up Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII. Naturally, this generation isn't without its own defining set of games, too, and one of those titles is undoubtedly Mass Effect 2a project from the minds at Canadian developer Bioware.If you only pay attention to the PlayStation 3 scene, you might be confused as to when the original Mass Effect came out and why you never heard about it or played it. Unfortunately, 2007's Mass Effect never made it to the PS3. The series' first entry came only to Xbox360 and PC, and due to Microsoft having published the game, PS3 owners will never see it on their native console. Mass Effect 2, however, is another story entirely.It's perfectly natural for gamers to be wary of jumping into the Mass Effect series with the second game, but BioWare has delivered a compelling package that does its best to quell any uncertainty with skipping the first title. It's worth noting that the original Mass Effect is a different game in many respects from Mass Effect 2, so in terms of gameplay, you're getting the better experience right off the bat. And while Mass Effect 2 is certainly a story-driven affair related directly to the original title, you'll have access to an in-game comic book feature that explains the story of the first game and lets you make choices that will affect your playthrough of the sequel. Combine that with the fact that Mass Effect 2 on PS3 has a slew of DLC extras and even an upgraded game engine, and you'll be struck by the obvious: Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation 3 is the best, most complete version of the game available.Mass Effect 2 is the product of artfully mixing certain genres. On one hand, it's a third-person shooter. On the other hand, it's an RPG with sandbox, open-world sensibilities. BioWare has brilliantly blended together these genres and influences to craft an experience that's not only much better than the admittedly-fantastic original Mass Effect, but also better than virtually all of the like-minded games on the market today. It provides a more streamlined experience than the original, with more focus on character development and action and less on some of the minutiae that bogged down the series' first outing.The Mass Effect series introduces gamers to an alternate form of our galaxy where humanity has found alien life. Using a special device orbiting Pluto called a Mass Relay, humanity jettisons to the far edges of the galaxy only to run into a bunch of other species that have known about each other for some time. No one really trusts the humans (the new kids on the block) and our species is left struggling both for galactic trust and identity in the face of a brand-new existential threat. That's where you come in.Mass Effect 2 begins under dire circumstances. You'll immediately witness the abrupt and violent death of the main character named Commander Shepard, only to find him or her resurrected by a rich, xenophobic human-first group called Cerberus. There's a reason Cerberus used its unlimited resources to revive Shepard, however, and it has to do with stopping the threat posed by the Collectors, a nebulous species that targets human space colonies. As this threat grows, so too does Cerberus' resolve to stop them, and they'll use Shepard and his or her team of assembled bad-asses to get things done.But Shepard isn't a static character. The beauty of Mass Effect 2 is that it is what you make it. While Mass Effect 2 certainly has a string of events that ultimately lead from point A to point Z, getting to and through all of the points in between opens up a staggering amount of choices, paths and outcomes. All of this is centered around the Paragon/Renegade choice system, where Shepard can make kind, understanding and righteous decisions (Paragon) or harsh, to-the-point and uncompassionate decisions (Renegade). But it's the gray in between that's truly riveting, and this particular aspect of the game will no doubt floor players. Everything you say, everything you do, and everything you decide upon has lasting, real consequences in the game -- both for the better and the worse. And be mindful, because those choices will one day affect your playthrough of Mass Effect 3, too.Apart from its story-driven nature and RPG influences, Mass Effect 2 is a third-person action game at its core, and the gameplay is fluid and well-executed. Under most circumstances, you'll get to bring two party members of your choice along with you. The computer will largely control these two characters, though you can use various weapon and skill wheels to offer up commands for those characters during the heat of battle. This is, of course, in addition to controlling Shepard himself (or herself), which will require you to quickly become comfortable with your particular character's strengths and weaknesses. Mass Effect 2 relies on character classes, so if you're playing as a Soldier, you better get used to using a wide variety of weapons. On the other hand, Vanguards and Sentinels will be relying far more on Biotics and Tech than conventional firearms.Much of the game revolves around recruiting your team members from various corners of the galaxy, and each member of your team plays an important role in ultimately working to stop the Collectors. Better yet, the aforementioned Paragon and Renegade slants you can take through the game will help you nurture or maim your relationships with each person. Treat the characters well, tend to them, listen to their ramblings, and even complete character-specific quests for them, and they'll become loyal. Ignore them, treat them badly, and use them solely as battle fodder, and they may not like you so much. Relationships can even become romantic under certain circumstances, so you can try to cultivate something more than friendship if you so desire.With the combat, characters, setting and story so solid, you would think you wouldn't need anything else. But there's more. Mass Effect nerds know full-well that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the insane amount of detail put into everything. So while combat and conversation may wear you out from time to time, that won't stop you from going to planets and mining for minerals that will allow you to upgrade your ship, your weapons, and your armor. This also won't stop you from completing one of the game's many side quests or reading the insanely-detailed codex and planet entries.Mass Effect 2 is a game with a staggering amount of high quality content. And better yet, it's all painted over with a slick coat of awesome.", "This game has one of the best storytelling of any video game.At first I didn't know what to expect but once I started playing the game I knew this will be in my top 5 games of all time. The game has a solid story, Bioware (game developer) put a lot of thought in each character...basically there's a mini wikipedia feature in the game. As for the gameplay, you can pick 1 of the 4 character classes in the game; so there's a lot of replay value if you decide to experience the whole Mass effect. The rpg elements are there but it mostly an action game which I was pleased because I didn't feel the game was slow at all.With that said, I put in over 80 hours of gameplay so I can get all of the trophies. I can honestly say this game is my #1 pick...and I thought the first Bioshock was my favorite until I played ME2.I can't wait for Mass Effect 3!", "NOTE: The comic book download that lets you &#34;catch up&#34; with ME1 is now available for FREE on the PSN store.I rather wish I had waited a bit longer to play ME2, as I hadn't played ME1 and would have enjoyed that comic book download to establish a baseline for the story, but it really didn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  Even starting cold with ME2, I very quickly caught up with what was going on and who was who.  The characters were engaging and while the main quest is very linear, there are enough decisions to make where you feel that you have sufficient input as to where the story was going.  And it's a fine story with well-developed characters who you get to know quite well as you recruit them and go on special missions to curry their loyalty.This is a shooter with RPG elements.  You'll spend most of your time ducking and shooting at enemies from cover, which is a lot of fun with the different types of guns and powers at your disposal.  There is a squad-management element, but they're smart enough to back you up without much help if you aren't inclined to give them direction (which I wasn't... I kept forgetting that was an option LOL).The difficulty level is fine and it's a very enjoyable experience.  Not to be missed.", "First - let me save you some time.  If you liked Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, just go ahead and buy this game, because you'll love it.  They were both developed by BioWare, and they are just amazing at creating action RPGs.  You'll definitely seem a resemblance to KOTOR right away, and that's a good thing.  I held off a long time on getting this game because I wasn't sure if I would like it, as I am primarily into RPGs, noir games, and open sandbox gameplay.  Some of my favorite games are KOTOR, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy games, Elder Scrolls series, Grand Theft Auto, Sleeping Dogs, Dragon Age, Fallout, etc.  I'm not typically super into shooter games that are really linear (although I do like Max Payne), and it was difficult to get a straight answer out of anyone: WILL I LIKE THIS GAME AS AN RPGER???!!Yes....you totally will.  If you haven't played KOTOR, then let me explain a little more.  Yes, the game has a lot of focus on weapons and you do a lot of shooting, but it has an amazing storyline (really, it's THAT good), and great characters that you can switch around on your team RPG-style, and interact with them, get to know them, etc.  You can also make decisions that impact the future.  It's not a full-blown RPG by any means like Skyrim, but it has kind of old school RPG elements mixed in with shooting and action.  It's a really stellar combination that just gives amazing gameplay.OH - if you've played Dragon Age: Origins and loved that, you will probably like this too.  Once again, it's not as much as an RPG as DA:O, but it's also made by BioWare and has the same feel to it.  You even get blood armor at the beginning that has the dragon logo on it.  If you really like BioWare games, this is really a no-brainer.The reviews for this game really speak for itself and there are LOTS of them, so I'm not going to go into detail about a lot more - I'm just giving you a viewpoint from an old-school RPG player who was hesitant to play this game at first.  Well, stop hesitating and buy it already! :)", "I love this game. The characters and set pieces are amazing. I love the story, and the characters are amazing. I feel connected to these people and aliens and my choices are hard to make at times. I was never interested in this game and simply purchased it because I had nothing to play, and my goodness it is great and I regret not getting into this sooner. Easily one of my favorite games and I have not even played part 3. Great game, must play for gamers.", "I jumped right into Mass Effect 2 after playing the first Mass Effect on Xbox, and it's more of the same...and that's not a bad thing!  The story picks up about two years after the Battle of the Citadel and the defeat of Saren Arterius.  Overall, the storyline is very well written, and the characters are strongly developed.  There's sooo much dialogue in this game that it could easily fill up a 300+page novel rather easily.  The language can also be harsh at times; we have the inclusion of the four-letter F word here (which was not in the first game at all...thank you, Jack.)  It took me about 50 hours to complete the game, and every single second was well worth it.However, I gave this game 4 stars (like for the original Mass Effect) because of the derived nature of the storyline.  Again, all the ideas were clearly borrowed from other epic sci-fi franchises (Star Wars and Star Trek, to name a few).  Basically, whatever I said in my original Mass Effect review about the borrowed nature of this series holds true here, so you may want to search my profile page for that review.  With that said, I'd just like to add that the final Reaper boss fight made me think of The Terminator so much that I should add that franchise to the list of BioWare's creative pool of borrowed ideas.Three other explicit instances of the unoriginal storyline concept to the game include the following:  the Illusive Man is clearly modeled after the cigarette-smoking man in the X-Files; the Krogan race is clearly modeled after the Klingons of Star Trek lore (and hey, Michael Dorn who played Worf in Star Trek TNG actually voiced one of the Krogan in this game!!  hint hint!); and Mordin, the Salarian scientist, broke out singing a Gilbert & Sullivan song (much like Capt. Picard & Worf did in the movie, Star Trek Insurrection).  The influences are loud and clear!  BioWare, I'm totally onto your psychological, creative line of storytelling, and frankly, I should be a writer on your team.  Your sales would probably skyrocket even more than your current profit margins would indicate, but I digress on that...Anyway, one minor note to make in this PS3 version:  the dialogue cuts out occasionally at the end of certain speeches....not harmful to the game, but it can be annoying.  As of this review, I just started Mass Effect 3, and it's amazing.  This time, BioWare decided to go all-out with borrowing heavily from The War of the Worlds....BioWare, e-mail me or call me :-)", "This game was very awesome and fun to play! It took me about 3 hours to really understand how to play and what to do, but I also wound up putting 40 hours into competing the main missions and some side missions as well. I was overwhelmed at first, but then you just get to know what to do and where to go. You have the option of continuing your game after beating it, or starting up a new game with your current character. I still have a couple of DLC missions to play, and probably 10-15 side missions too, so I chose to just continue my current game. I focused on the main missions and completed all the dossier and loyalty missions for my squadmates. If I didn't have such a backlog of games, I would absolutely start up another game with another character.One negative of Mass Effect 2 would be the load screens. It seems to take about a minute each time. This didn't bother me at all, but I know it does for some people. Something else I noticed was that my characters really didn't get very many new weapons. I'm a looter and check every nook and cranny for everything, and yes I did get weapon upgrades and upgraded them, but nothing exciting and different. I did just finish up Borderlands not too long ago, so maybe I was expecting a bazillion guns like that game!?!One cool thing I liked about ME2 was that you can literally save anywhere and anytime. I like games like that so you don't have to play for an hour to be able to save.Without hesitation, I would recommend this game. Especially considering how cheap it is. It was so good, that I think I might just continue on with Mass Effect 3 even though I have other games I have been looking forward to playing (Red Dead Redemption, Arkham City GOTY). I don't think you can really go wrong with this game. Enjoy!!", "I don't have an Xbox, so I've never played the original Mass Effect and wasn't really sure what to expect here.  What I found in this game is easily one of the best 3rd-person shooters ever made!  I was shocked at just how good this game was, and I played it twice through consecutively, despite it being around 30 hours long.  The final mission was just awesome, one of the best I can recall in a video game, with consequences for the decisions you make.  There is a good variety of characters, personalities and skill sets to choose your team from.  You can also choose how to play and upgrade your character.  I found myself drawn to the sniper style.Why did I only give the game 4 stars for the fun ranking?  It was because the planet mining missions you have to do to gather materials for upgrades were mind-numbingly boring!  The game really could have done without this part and I'm not sure what the developers were thinking with that.", "I must be a fan that the developers dream of hooking.  I never played Mass Effect, but I downloaded the demo and played it this morning.  And OMG...I felt like I was watching a movie.That door I was about to go through?  What the heck would be on the other side?5 different difficulty levels, including one for someone like me, who missed the shooter bandwagon, so that I could enjoy this game?  Genius.  Not everyone is a hardcore player.  But if I improve...yes there's an insane difficulty!Multiple choices, both in what class you choose AND the decisions you can make throughout the game?  By my count this game could go at least 15-20 different playthroughs.  I can't think of another shooter that offers that many.There is not thought process needed here.  I went out after playing the demo this morning and bought it.  And I cannot wait to sink 50-100 hours into learning everything about the game.Believe the review sites on this one.  It's worth every penny and with a Casual difficulty mode, anyone and I mean ANYONE can enjoy this game.", "Mass Effect 2 for the Playstation 3 has everything: Gorgeous people and aliens, Cool weapons, Vehicles to go rampaging with, a great story, visuals that will impress you, and your unique choices trigger outcomes in the next installment coming out the fourth quarter of 2011 (something I wish Final Fantasy did). It takes a great deal of time to finish, and once you've come out on the other side, having witnessed the breathtaking ending, you can start over with bonuses or continue on with the game in order to flesh out your characters to your satisfaction. In one word: incredible.Your ship takes you to the far reaches of the Milky Way, through ancient Mass Relays built by a long extinct species. Humans never learned how to produce them, but thankfully you can catch a quick ride to important spots and help save humanity along the way. While playing, I felt as though I was a small speck in a much larger galaxy, with events that were way over my head.From the beginning, you are thrown into the mix, with your ship taking a galactic beating, and with only seconds to make some choices, clouded with confusion, you must make lasting choices. I loved the gravity that every choice had. I had to contemplate some choices with weight. My curioustiy peaked at what I had missed out on by taking the high road. Playing safe may not sound very fun, but the impact of this game feels very real, and you do not want to capriciously make enemies who could otherwise be valuable team members.The voice acting is the best I've ever heard. Just about everything is explained with good acting and charm to boot. There are some big name actors like Martin Sheen, who gives an unforgetable performance. If you're a Battlestar Galactica fan, Michael Hogon has a surprise role here also. There is a codex, which is a galactic wikipedia, filled with useful information about the aliens in Mass Effect and even the codex is voiced! There are only a couple of corny moments near the end, where Shepard gives a heroic speech, that I sortof snickered at, but it was still effective, and it pumped me up still.The battle system is fluid, and instensely fun. You can train your powers to hotbuttons and fly through battles with expert skill, but you can also slow things down, which is especially helpful in hard battles that would otherwise be overwhelming. You lock time with a shoulder button and give a good look around the terrain. Enemies can fly from everywhere, and it is important to assign your team in the most useful ways.I took my time finding as many crew members as possible and then making them loyal, and along the way I just happened to play the incredible levels from my Downloadable Content. The Shadow Broker is just epic. You fight your way across the hull of a gigantic and ancient space ship, with an atmosphere tearing itself apart around you. The nebulous atmosphere had the effect of awe on me. You navigate within the ship passing along the way the internal makings of the mysterious ship which were amazing in themselves. And I couldn't help but look outside a windown at the incredible clouds and lightning along the way! It really is one of the most scenic moments in video game history in my opinion.Exploring and interacting the characters of the game is one of the most rewarding things to do in Mass Effect 2. There will be characters that you find very interesting and will want to learn all about. If you finish the Shadow Broker level ( I should say when you finish) you gain access to some private information to most of the characters in the game. There are some really funny things in there to read, like what subscriptions a character has, and also some eaves droppings on some peoples conversations.Just a side note here, Mass Effect 2 Arrival is the last chapter to be released before the next installment comes in the fall. The Reapers are coming, and you feel the universe is unraveling in anticipation. This DLC comes out March 29 2011 in the US on PSN, and will cost around 10 bucks. It is very rewarding to have these action packed additions to play after you have beaten the game.Mass Effect 2 is an astounding achievement in video game making. It pushes the limits of the powerful Playstation 3, and the effect is uncommon to all my years of playing video games. The universe of Mass Effect is so impressive that Warner Bros. will distribute a film adaptation in the near future. Mass Effect has built up a strong fan base in a relatively short time and is an icon already! Every alien race is unique, and created with a lust for details and fans everywhere are extolling the greatness of this franchise. I am most impressed that all my choices and beloved encounters will live on with Mass Effect 3, and really, it would be a real shame if it only remained as memories. There is not much of anything that is lacking, and the imagination required to make this game is commendable. A must have for any gamer out there.", "Here's a game that came out a year ago and defined the Xbox 360 and PC platforms for the year. It was one of the highest-rated games of all-time, and rightfully so. Now it's here for PlayStation 3 owners to embrace, but this time around, it's even better.Mass Effect 2 is a highly-customizable game that allows you to assume control of the protagonist, Commander Shephard, who can be fully customized to your specifications including gender, face, and even class. The narrative is incredibly dynamic, and as a result you can choose how you want the game to play out however you like.The game looks good, but most of all it has an outstanding presentation. Animations are smooth, and the user-interface is always easy to navigate. Audio is golden, with high-quality voice work from every character in the game, and even a great soundtrack to boot.Gameplay is much better this time around in the Mass Effect universe. The shooting gameplay is precise, and commanding yourself and your squad is always easy to do. There are also some extras in the game like hacking, mini-games, and more, and each of these help add lots of variety.Given the fact that the game offers so many different experiences including classes, dialogue options, and more, you'll have plenty of reasons to come back and experience some more. This is a game that many people play several times over, and you likely will too.Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games this generation, and the PlayStation 3 version is the best version yet. If you enjoy a good story, or just being in a wonderful sci-fi world, then Mass Effect 2 PS3 is an easy game to recommend.", "I played through this game on my computer when it first came out.  I really loved it then, but in the excitement of a new game (and having an excuse to put off school work) I rushed through it.I pick up the PS3 version when it came out thinking that it would be nice to go back through the game at a more even pace and try to appreciate the RPG elements of the game rather than just the shooting.  Boy am I glad I did.  Playing through Mass Effect 2 for me ranks up there with the my first read through of the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was a kid.  It is really that good.  Here's why:- The shooter part of the game is solid.  Weapons have a nice feel, bullet impact is satisfying, and it can be tactical if you want it to be (set the difficulty high).- There is so much intelligently-written content:  The characters are likable and realistic and have very interesting back-stories.  Sure, there are plenty of sci-fi cliches here, but just when the game seems to be falling deeply in to one it surprises you.  And makes you stop and think.- The moral choices you make actually feel like they have weight.  I don't think I could say that for any other game I've played and I've play many.  The paragon (good-ish) vs. renegade (bad-ish) seems simple enough at first, but as you surf through dialogue trees you'll soon realize how much subtlety there is and the more you get into the role-playing (literally speaking) of the game, the more rewarding it is.And there were a few very minor things about the game that I did not like:- There often is not a dialogue choice for what you'd really like to say- With PS3 version there can be some choppiness during cut scene (not enough to be distracting)- At times the story feels a bit linear, though the included extra content helps lessen thisOVERALL:- I can't say enough positive things about this game.  For pure, hardcore shooter fans (of the Call-o'-duty variety), the combat in this game will be satisfying, but you might find the pacing a bit slow.  For Adventure/Action/RPG/shooter (half life-type variety) fans this game is a must purchase and the PS3 version is as good as the PC (and probably the xbox version, though I haven't played that one).  Plus, the extra content included with the PS3 version makes the game even better and longer.  I'm trying to get as much school-work done as possible before Mass Effect 3 comes out.  Kudos Bioware, keep making games this good and I'll keep buying a copy for each system I own", "As a huge sci-fi fan I feel like there have not been as many good or great video games in the genre as there should be. One of the first and greatest games I've ever played all the way through was the original Knights of the Old Republic. As a life long Star Wars devotee, all I wanted was another game like that, great RPG elements fused with the world of Star Wars and things I already knew about and loved. This is what took me so long to get into playing the Mass Effect games. I know Bioware has done some excellent games in their time (including KOTOR) but I was hesitant to enter a new universe of people and races and conflicts I wasn't already familiar with.I finally made the jump after needing something new to play and I was not disappointed. I think ME2 is the best game in the series. There are elements from the third game that I wish had been implemented in the second one but the storytelling and worlds of the second game were up there with the best of them. I also think the sequel has one of the best final segments in all of video games. The weapons and the combat system are excellent, all the characters are diverse and crucial to the overall story. Traveling the different planets contributes to the sense that you are very far from earth. The musical was also instrumental in playing to the deep science fiction feeling the game gives.", "So everything that can be said about this game's content, storyline, characters, etc, has been said a million times, but I thought I'd post my thoughts on this game from a PS3 player, who never got to play ME1, started with this game, played 3, and just in the last month, have got the chance to download hte original to playSo yeah, its kinda like watching Empire, Jedi, and never getting to see a new hope, and then watching them all together for the first time.  This game is fantastic that even though I never played the original, it never confused you and caught you up fast.  Funny that my favorite character is always Garrus, as he's just.....your wingman, your best friend, who's always there for you, and now going back to ME1, where he just &#34;met me&#34; for the first time, is weird.  But I guess thats how it is starting in the middle of something :)Overall, the ME series is fantastic, have been with Bioware since Baldur's Gate running on my PC when I was a teenager, and this and the dragon age games are the best experiences in games.", "omg great story. this game saved the ps3 back in 2011. it was so good that i bought it when it was on sale for 19.99 at gameystopy...i think you should try this if you like to act like you have any control in the results your character will have in the end.......in the end pretty much happens regardless of what options you pick other than small little bonuses you carry over to the next game but for the main part you don't really control faith. boooooooring", "Played this on PC previously, but I wanted to get the whole series on my PS3.  The trilogy was a little higher than what I wanted to spend, and I actually saved about 12 bucks by buying this and ME3 separately, then buying ME1 through PSN.", "After hearing Xbox 360 owners swoon over this game for the past year, PS3 owners have finally been blessed with one of this generation's best games.  This is one of those games where you can believe all the stories you hear, and buy with confidence...it is a masterfully crafted labor of love that you won't ever forget.  If you're a fan of the great space sagas of science fiction, be prepared to add the universe of Mass Effect into that pantheon of great sci fi lore that includes by Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek and the like.  It's that good.The game itself falls somewhere in between the genres of third person shooter and role playing.  The action in the game is great fun, especially later in the game when your characters are powered up and you are able to turn the battlefields into almost theatrical displays of gunfire and special powers unleashed by your team.  Aside from squad selection, there isn't a whole lot of necessary tactical thought required to get through the game's action sequences...just a mastery of the cover and shoot system and knowledge of the special abilities in which your character is endowed, as well as those of your 2 teammates.  The locales are fantastic, thanks to the great art design seemingly inspired from every science fiction movie and television show to come before.  When you're not fighting to accomplish your objectives, you are exploring the galaxy in your starship...mining planets for minerals to upgrade your ship, armor, weaponry and powers, discovering new star systems & missions, and interacting with the different alien species of the Milky Way.  Bioware has struck a perfect balance here between action and RPG-style exploration.  You'll want to explore every corner of the galaxy just to experience this universe fully and gain every possible advantage you can before your final mission.The accessible action and RPG elements of Mass Effect 2 allow the player to focus on what is the center of this game...the story.  Full of intrigue, excitement, mystery, and sadness, its quite simply one of the greatest stories ever told in the genre of video games.  Shepherd's quest from initially being resurrected from near-death by the mysterious organization Cerberus, to the seemingly against-all-odds final mission is epic in every sense of the word, and is made possible by characters brought to vivid life in ways that video games haven't done before.  The phenomenal voice acting (the best I've ever heard in a video game) and brilliantly written dialogue make everything feel so personal and realistic.  You'll find yourself conflicted when you have to make big decisions that can alter the fates of not just your teammates, but the fates of entire worlds.  You FEEL this game.  You become attached to certain characters, despise others, and find yourself being emotionally pulled in so many directions through the game's many hours.  It feels like a milestone, an important moment for video games that truly raises the bar for the medium in terms of its capability to tell a story.The game looks and sounds great too.  If there were any faults to the game, the only one I could think of is that the game was not very challenging at all on the Normal difficulty setting.  Obviously, the designers wanted to bring both the story, and the way you as a player can shape it, to the forefront.  They were more than successful in doing this, so that's why I find it hard to even complain about the difficulty level.  Any of the shortcomings are more than forgivable given the game's many strengths.  The game makes we wish that I had gotten the opportunity to play the first Mass Effect.  While the in-game comic book gives a good overview of the first game and sets the stage fairly well for your playthrough of Mass Effect 2, you can't help but realize that the comic book is in no way a worthy substitute for playing the first game, especially after playing Mass Effect 2 for a few hours and realizing how deep the lore of this universe is.But in the end, those of us who own only a PS3 are incredibly fortunate that this amazing game found its way to our console.  Believe the hype.  This is one of the finest games of our time.", "\"Note I did not play Mass Effect (the original).  Standard disclaimer: I never buy new releases, instead usually pick up popular titles 1-2 years after initial release to reduce the cost, and number of duds.ME2 with the DLC is interesting, has some impressive graphics and a well developed storyline, and has decent combat play (controls, physics, shield/health system, reasonable difficulty level, and one or two modest problem solving challenges).  Side missions are OK (DLC included with the version I bought was much better than the side missions).  I have a couple gripes, the primary being the length of the loading screens, and the fact that you have to wait for the entire loading time whenever you die.  Additionally I think it is a shortcoming that you spend so much time recruiting your crew, but only the final mission allows you to take more than two of your crew with you.  My third main complaint is that the second play-through doesn't really seem to add the bonuses and specials that the info-blurbs on the loading screens promise.  While there seem to be many dialogue options, most of the actual storyline seems to progress along the same path regardless of your choices.  The dialog seems mostly to affect the paragon/renegade status, and only in very rare instances actually changes outcomes.  Besides not really offering significantly different action sequences, the second playthrough also doesn't offer the chance to fully max out characters (levels and special abilities seem to be capped at 30), doesn't offer new weapons, and doesn't seem to offer any particularly interesting new enemies or upgrades.  My last nit regarding the storyline is that once you complete all the recruitment and loyalty missions the vast majority of the game is over.  This felt rather disappointing after all the effort it took to assemble the whole team.  Finally the \"\"planet mining\"\" side game is I think a missed opporunity to introduce another puzzle/problem solving element (hacking and security bypasses in the main game are reminiscent of the hacking side-game in the first bio-shock).  Instead it is a mindless, time consuming exercise, with no real challenge and appropriately little payoff (the hard part is collecting the upgrades, not collecting the ores).  With all the DLC, side missions, loyalty missions, 100% exploration of all planets, clusters, etc, it will be 30-40 hours for most folks I think.If you've played a fair number of shooters I don't think you'll find too much really innovative in this title.  The story line is a bit more developed (in a soap-opera kind of way) than most, but Resistance, Fall of Man for example has a similarly rich backstory which at least for me was more compelling save-the-earth plot line than the save-the-universe plot line for ME2.  Overall 4 stars because of the (current) low price with included DLC.\"", "After spending about 10 hours on this game, I believe that ME2 can be best described as an RPG-lite/adventure game comprised of a mixture of the following games: BioShock, Star Wars: KOTOR, and Rainbow Six series. The RPG elements aren't as deep as you might expect, as ME2 seems to cater to a wider audience by being more of an adventure/shooter game. The dialog system, as you might already know, is deep and engrossing. The shooting mechanics is a cover-based 3rd-person perspective with the ability to issue basic orders to your squadmates (such as move to a specific spot, use a specific power/weapon to take out an enemy), hence the reference to R6. Weapon customization is relatively light; you can spend currency to research upgrades but they don't seem to make a big difference in the performance of the weaponry. This is slightly disappointing.There is a lot to do and experiment with in this game. You can explore open areas, talk to people, take on side and story missions, scour planets for resources, etc. Despite the variety, I find myself spending most of my time on side and story missions. Although you have the ability to choose the order which you complete the mission, it's not always easy to tell which move the plot forward and which do not. Not a huge issue. Also, each story mission seems to be quite linear, which is expected of course. The issue is, sometimes the mission can get long and does not allow you to save until you reach the next logical checkpoint, and you have no idea if it is one minute or 10 minutes away. This could be problematic if you can only play for short periods at a time such as myself.The dialog/plot, which most 'professional' reviewers believe to be the main strength of this game, seems to move along at a relatively slow pace. Granted I'm not deep into the game, but after 10 hours, I had expected to learn/discover more information.Overall, this is a decent game that should appeal to RPG/adventure gamers. It is by no means perfect but it does provide solid entertainment.Pros+ Solid visuals/graphics; high production value.+ Decent control scheme.+ Solid voice acting which enhances credibility of the story.Cons- Most story missions are linear and some have lengthy periods without any save points.- Weapon/power uprgrade system does not seem to make a noticeable difference in performance.- Some minor bugs such as screen tearing and freezing.", "I thought that Uncharted 2 was the best ps3 game ever, until i played about 15 hours of mass effect 2. Everything is great.The good:- Story is amazing, i didnt play Mass Effect, but with a couple of videos and the interactive comic i was on board with the universe.- Graphics are great, some enviroments are amazing- Gameplay is very addictive, i love strategize with my biotic powers- The characters are all memorable, and you actually get to care about them. SPOILER  Thankfully everyone survived in the end /ENDSPOILER- Customization amazing- Conversations are engaging- The game is very deep and the universe is amazingThe bad:-  NOTHINGBuy this game is extremely good", "While I never played the first Mass Effect I did get the sequel and third games and though it would help somewhat to know what happened in the first game overall it's not really needed or necessary as the flashback and history is told enough to help you up to date on the games main storyline.  Like with other RPG like games you're allowed to create your own characters from gender/appearance/abilities similar to other games like Saints Row and the like though there is only one voice actor/actress for the character so no real choice on that part.The graphics are good as are the effects the gameplay itself feels a little like Gears Of War and Deus Ex though with obvious differences of course. Also like RPG games you can do side quest and other stuff too if you don't want to rush through the main quest.  So if you're looking for a good sci-fi adventure RPG TPS game here's one to put into your game library.", "I finished this game and I was sad to do so. It is a great game. I really enjoyed the capability to go on quests in whatever order I wish. The 'open world' aspect is terrific - I can do anything I want in any order. The RPG skills were really cool, and combat was awesome! I really liked the Soldier profession and hope it remains mostly unchanged in ME3. I could explore, shop, fight ... very nice setup of things to do. As far as switching weaponry in-between missions, I usually kept the latest - and greatest - weapons available. My favorite weapon was the second tier assault rifle - fires 3 shots at once! This was a great game in a special universe.", "i like this game, i can't move around how i would really like but i accept that. i want to roam freely while walking but whenever you draw your guns you get into shooter position.i can't do anything about that but i do like playing it. the graphics are amazing", "\"I owned ME1 and ME2 on 360.  I loved the games so much that I beat them at least 5 times a piece.  However, my 360 wasn't online and as such, I missed out on the DLC.  Now my 360 is online, but I wanted to show my support for ME2 yet again.  So I purchased this on the day it came out and sat down to play it.  After going through it twice (once Renegade and once Paragon and a little over 80% trophy completion), here's my 2 cents......The first thing I want to address is the \"\"bugs\"\" and \"\"glitches\"\".  While I have had some bugs here and there as well as some poor syncing in the sounds and voices, I would not say it overly detracted from the game itself.  I have had to restart 3 times do to freezing and never lost more than 30 minutes of gameplay.  Maybe I lucked out.  However, the fact remains that, for all the isues I have read about, my experience yielded no more issues or bugs than any other game I have played.....in fact, it yielded much less.ME2 still remains one of the most beautifully made games ever.  This pertains to the story, the gameplay, the characterization, the graphics.....everything.  The added DLC was a treat for me as I didn't get to play with it on 360.  In my opinion, this game is a bargain at full price.  Even if you take in to account the fact that the game is older and cheaper for 360, the simple fact is I would pay full price again and again for a game that is made well and has multiple ways to play through it........no matter how old.Now since Microsoft still retains the rights to ME1, PS3 owners will not get the full opening story for this franchise.  Instead, they are given an interactive comic book overview that allows the players to make the big choices from ME1.  While this was a brilliant work-around, the end result is far less engaging and emotionally taxing than playing through the first game.  While this makes the tough calls easier to make.....they SHOULDN'T be easier.  The amazing aspect of ME1 was how hard it was to make those choices.  It was also amazing to have some of the side quests that came from my smaller choices from ME1.  However, if you do not have the means to play it on 360, take what you can get.  ME2 is a great game in its own right and even though I missed getting the opportunity to play ME1 on PS3, ME2 delivers in spades even with me having already experienced the game in depth.Simply put, if you have the means to play this on PC or 360, do so.  The ability to buy the games cheaper AND get to really experience the first game is an opportunity no gamer should overlook.  However, I realize that this is not a conceivable route for some.  If a PS3 is all you have, then ignore the naysayers.  This game is a MUST OWN and shouldn't be passed up.  With the hefty amount of DLC added in, it's a powerhouse of gaming that can keep you entertained for a LONG time.  Play it however you want on whatever you want.......just make sure you play it.\"", "SPOILERS BELOWOk, ME2 has Shepard assembling a team of scientists, tech experts, biotic commandoes, assassins and mercenaries to take on the Collectors....and it is a phenomenal ride.  The mission you go on to find each individual team member plus the second mission to gain their loyalty, as well as when  you combat the Collectors....gives you alot of playing time to build your team, get accustomed to each member's strengths, and to even find the extra but optional members Legion and Grunt.The graphics are extremely good, the storyline is second to none, and the dialogue options allow you to either make Shepard a by-the-book good guy, a no-holds-barred bad dude, or somewhere in between.I played this again after beating Mass Effect 3, and was again pleasantly surprised with how much fun this game still is.It is a must have for hardcore and casual gamers alike, plus it is cheap right now, so no need to rent...just buy.", "I have been wanting to play this ever since I heard about it coming out on XBOX 360.  I'm so glad to see this title finally hit the PS3.  I'm not very far into it, but I love it.  Gorgeous graphics, a great story and plenty of action to keep your on your toes.", "\"I'm no Mass Effect fan-boy, so let's get that out there.  Clearly, the game came out years ago, and I am just now solving it, long after most of the buzz has died down (for 2, anyway) .  Yet, there are people still reviewing this game in the last few days, and laying claim that it is the best game they've played.Well, because it is.  I've been playing games since pre-Atari 2600 days, and I can honestly say that this is the culmination of gaming history up until this point.  It is the best example of multi-genre excellence I've ever seen, and it sucked me in for over 50 hours, first time around.From the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way.  Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic (Uncharted comes to mind, as does Bioshock) but Ive never been pulled into a game with a \"\"need to play\"\" like ME2 has done.  It does almost everything to a \"\"10\"\", and even some minor quibbles are tolerable as the story develops into the richest gaming experience you might have on a console to date.The diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it.  The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on.  I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction. The \"\"choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say.That's just one part of the mix, and it all blends to make the game what it is.  From solidly envisioned sound effects for weapons and vehicles to the dark ambient beats at the club on Omega, sound was as well thought out as the rest of the game.  Graphically, it is gorgeous, and even with the extreme size of the game (settings and worlds), still makes its mark as one of the best looking to date.  Gameplay is never too far from the cutscenes in its graphical quality. Background rendering is fantastic, and close-ups of faces...well, the resolution is as high-def as you'd want it, edging closer and closer to photo-realistic.Gameplay is varied, but never boring (except one mission, which I would still do again), and its mixed up enough to keep it fresh.  The only hazy bit, control-wise, was the land-shuttle piloting, but it can be forgiven.  Main missions, loyalty missions, side missions, mining, collecting...it has it all.  First person shooting takes a forefront to the RPG side, but I think it keeps it moving, and there is enough strategy involved for me.When a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job. This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something.  Many say we are in the true golden-age of television, and I think this can also be said of video games, which have now reached a level that has begun to rival anything you can watch as entertainment.  Its an exciting time to play, and even more by the fact that I am sure Mass Effect 3 will once again raise the bar for this type of experience.  Even if it were identical in all aspects, it would still trump anything currently on the market, and that says a lot.  This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future.Simply put, the best game I've ever played..\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03655588999390602, 0.025540169328451157, 0.07158015668392181, 0.03857829421758652, 0.02442987821996212, 0.005785685032606125, 0.05709802359342575, 0.0020006075501441956, 0.054154057055711746, 0.008959732949733734, 0.01771983876824379, 0.07877986133098602, 0.039279431104660034, 0.057865507900714874, 0.01165809202939272, 0.018888071179389954, 0.03949298337101936, 0.0009189542615786195, 0.08084026724100113, 0.0010424487991258502, 0.036956556141376495, 0.0015777386724948883, 0.03258400410413742, 0.042497675865888596, 0.020738456398248672, 0.03795888274908066, 0.05597418174147606, 0.003202698891982436, 0.010478120297193527, 0.005617107730358839, 0.08124664425849915]]}
