I think LittleBigPlanet 2 along with the first game have got to be the cutest games ever created. I love going through the level picking up new clothes and stickers. I also love the community levels people have created. And you can import your sackperson from the first game!", "I love this game.  Plain and simple.  I love the new story mode.  I love the improved graphics.  I love the new gadgets to include the new logic.  This new logic saves SOOOOO much thermometer space that the levels made in the first can be redone with the new logic and possibly expanded to be fanstasic.  If you loved the first one, you will love this one too.  If you've never played the first one, get it first, get everything you can and import that info into the second one.  My only hang-up is that this game is, as the title of my review says, everything the first one should have been.  If you want something the entire family can play, this is for sure your game!  Highly recommended!", "I got this game for my fianace, but I have to admit I've played almost as much as she has.  It's fun to be able to play together.  Highly Recommend!!!", "This is one of the best games I have for Playstation 3, it is way better than LBP 1. I play it with my 3 brothers and with the PS Move.", "You could make an argument that this is nothing more than an expansion pack of the first game, and you would be somewhat correct. However, this game adds many more tools that add to the original game (grappling hooks, jump pads, etc.). Plus, all of the user created content from the first game is playable in this version. The only thing you're missing from the first game is the Media Molecule created levels but this game has an entire new campaign to play through. I can't wait to see what the community creates with the new tools!", "\"The sequel to LittleBig Planet goes in some great new directions, but has left behind what made me fall in love with LBP in the first place. LittleBig Planet was an innovative side-scrolling platforming game that was whimsical, fun, great co-op and on top of it all, allowed you to be creative designing levels from numerous shapes, textures, stickers with motors and ropes and all sorts of things you could dream up.LittleBig Planet 2 seeks to continue the legacy that LittleBig Planet started in a play, create, share policy.  I hoped that LBP2 would be bigger, better, prettier, more robust and more fun than Little Big Planet.  The makers at Media Molecule behind the LittleBig Planet universe did numerous things to improve the franchise.This time around there's a storyline behind Sackboy's universe.  This gives him a reason to traverse the various planets of the LittleBig Planet universe.  There are cut-scenes and some very interesting characters along the way to meet in your journey.  These add to the story mode but while the story is interesting it's not reason enough alone to play LittleBig Planet 2.My biggest gripe here was that the levels themselves weren't as interesting or inventive story-wise as Little Big Planet, it's hard not to compare the sequel to its' predecessor and it really did have a lot to live up to.  I was hoping the story levels would be bigger and better, but all-in-all I think they're not as good.However, everything else is better and more.  There are more things you can use in Little Big Planet 2.  There's a grappling hook, there's the creatinator, the grabinator and several other one-at-a-time powerups similar to the paintinator released in dlc in the Metal Gear pack.  These things increase the options of things Sackboy can do in the LittleBig universe.  Then of course there's the controlinator allowing creators to design games that aren't even plat-formers or side scrolling.There's a downside to all these changes as much of what LittleBig Planet was seems to be left behind in favor of newer and different fronts.  I commend the people at Media Molecule for their efforts, but it seems they wanted to make the story-mode of LittleBig Planet 2 a showcase for what could be done with these new directions where the game can be taken.  They're fun diversions but ultimately at the end of the day I felt the main storyline wasn't as robust and interesting as the levels found in the story in the first LittleBig Planet.In every way the creation suite in LBP2 is much superior to that found in LBP though I found it more complicated and and also more confusing though the tutorials were more accessible, I still found myself at a loss of what I could use the various tools for to accomplish various goals of \"\"real life\"\" applications to show what could actually be done in the level maker.The community level sorting is truly much better than the first.  In many ways many parts of how this game works are much better than the first, menus, everything is much slicker and the creation area is more thought out as well, I just wish they had made the stroy modes as great as the first LBP.All-in-all, I would recommend LittleBig Planet 2, but don't expect the story-mode to be as full or robust with interesting puzzles and levels as found in the first LittleBig Planet, and while LBP2 goes in some great new directions, what it has left behind is what made me fall in love with LBP in the first place. Which makes LBP2 not as good of a stand-alone game but more of an add on to the original.\"", "Allow me to begin this review by pointing out that I rarely give a 5-star review for a video game. That is the score I reserve for a game that is just so incredibly fun or enjoyable that it goes above and beyond my expectations. While Little big Planet 2 has flaws, it is also insanely fun.If your childhood was anything like mine, you made use of almost anything laying around when you were playing with your friends. A cardboard box that your family's refrigerator came in would become a space ship or a fort and soda cans & toilet paper rolls were used to outline a race track. You'll see a similar aesthetic in LBP2 as corrugated cardboard or bits of wood are used to create wondrous levels.In terms of gameplay mechanics, LBP2 offers very little that is new. You can run, jump, move between the foreground and background, grab onto certain objects and with the use of power-ups you can pick up objects, fire projectiles or swing around in a manner similar to Bionic Commando on the NES. While you get a nice variety of levels and challenges you have probably played something like this game before. The story is pretty forgettable and playing through the game by yourself is good but not original.So why am I giving this game 5 stars? The multi-player. A 4 player game is just insanely fun and some of the levels are designed where you need two, three or four players to access certain areas and score key items. Players can interact with each other in a variety of ways like grabbing each other, pulling each other around, latching on to each other in the middle of a jump or the always fun slap. My friends and I are very guilty of slapping each other for 20-30 minutes on end. More times than I can count my friends and I could not talk simply because we were so busy laughing while playing LBP2.The other strength of LBP2 is also it's Achilles Heel. The Community. Players can create their own levels and publish them for others to try out. You can search for new levels or search by highest rated levels or even levels picked by the game developers. Some of the community levels are truly brilliant and this effectively means that LBP2 has infinite replay value as there will always be new levels for you to play. With that said, not every person out there is a good level designer. Some people just copy other levels and publish them for a cheap trophy and other levels are just plain broken. Fortunately players can rate and leave reviews on levels so you can easily avoid levels that are just a waste of time.As it stands, Little Big Planet 2 is currently my favorite game for the PS3 and well worth picking up. In fact, it would be a shame to pass this game up without at least trying it.", "\"First I would just like to say that the reason I don't have an Amazon confirmed purchase is because I received a review copy a few weeks back.LittleBigPlanet 2 is a stellar game. It improved upon its predecessor in every way imaginable. Here's a game that will satisfy you as a single-player experience, and will also become your go-to title for co-op play with friends.Visually, the game is clean and uncompromising. Textures have detail, and the mixture of colors gives this game a wonderful flair. The audio helps bring the entire presentation together with its well-fitted tracks. Heck, you can even make your own music in the online creator, so there's really no limit to this game.The gameplay is improved from the original LittleBigPlanet, and might feel a little slow to some, but I'd prefer to call it \"\"realistic\"\" versus other platformers such as Mario. The physics engine is powerful, and allows for hundreds of different scenarios when mixed together with the slew of textures, interactions, and more.If you're looking for a fun game that has tons content, this is it. The story mode is only about six hours in length, but includes a ton of unlockables. The multiplayer is another story. With so many options, the online experience is constantly evolving, and other players can provide you new experiences every time you log in. On top of that, you can choose to make a level yourself, and if you choose to do that, a robust level creator is waiting in-store for you.All in all, LittleBigPlanet 2 is a phenomenal game that entertains in the best of ways. I highly recommend it.\"", "I'm sure LBP has a ton of people who adore it. I have a problem with it: The gameplay just isn't that great. I dislike the multiple planes on which to walk, as I often find myself on the wrong side or switching when I don't want to. The physics are just off a bit. Jumping isn't as smooth or reliable as I'd like. When Nintendo has done it perfectly for the last 25 years, it's hard to play something that's inferior in that respect.You can create your own content and more importantly play what other people have made. There are many creative concepts to be sure - some I enjoyed quite a bit. But playing a game within a game is only fun for so long. If I want Pac-Man, I'll play real Pac-Man instead of LBP's fake Pac-Man.The stickers do nothing for me, by the way. They just seem like another shiny thing to distract you from the poor gameplay. And the fact that the levels use only user-generated elements means they're somewhat limited.I had hoped LBP2 would fix the first game's issues. Instead, it just gives you more make-your-own-entertainment options. I paid a not-small amount of money for this, Media Molecule; how about YOU entertain me?!", "This game is basically more of the same with LBP1, which to me is a great thing.  With the possibilities added by new game modes like racing, puzzlers, and RPG's, user created content will be more creative than ever (Just look at the Windows XP level or the Zelda one).The storyline has the same amount of charm as the first one while gameplay remains relatively the same.  Even better is that all the user created content and DLC from LBP1 will work with LBP2.A must buy for any fans of games.", "This game is awesome! I played the crap out of it lol. Thats how addictive it can get;) Buy it!!", "You would think the second time around they would fix the control issues. Instead, it's the same game as the first one except for different levels. Save your money....this game is not worth the aggravation!!!", "\"Honestly I wasn't really a fan of the first Little Big Planet, I kind of dismissed it and wrote it off as being a game geared more towards a younger audience and women. Even though a lot of people I knew recommended it to me I just kept to my stubborn old self and kept thinking if I have the chance to play it I would but I'm not going to go out of my way to, especially when so many Helghast (Killzone 2) needed to be dealt with. This time around I wanted to see if the hype was warranted, or if it was just overrated and only liked for the cuteness factor, similar to say Beanie Babies.Let me explain my title, which actually I have a twofold reason for. First, playing this game makes me feels as if I'm in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. I don't mean while Trolley is cruising the tracks either, this is during the time Mr. Rogers is hanging up his sweater and changing his shoes, the moment we don't normally see. Second reason is because of the creative side (make believe) to this game, not only in regard the campaign but also the user created content and side quests/mini-games. I love the new school/old school mash up style, it looks great and plays amazing.This game is cute to say the least, you won't find any Call of Dutyesque moments in this game at all. If you're looking for or only play games with an \"\"M\"\" rating this may not be for you. However if you are young or in touch with your inner child try this game, you'll enjoy it. This game has a little bit of everything; by far this is probably one of the least repetitive games I've ever played. The controls are simple and very fluid, from six to sixty there is pretty much no learning curve at all. The graphics are beautiful; the Little Big Planet world truly looks like it was put together from items you would find in a child's toy box.Bottom line is, this game is worth the money and your time! Pick it up, it's a very unique and enjoyable gaming experience that shouldn't be missed.Michael\"", "\"This game is unfortunately a disappointment. It has SO MUCH potential, I keep trying to force myself to play it in hopes I'll fall in love with it like I did the first game...but in the end it just doesn't come through.Pros:--Graphics look phenomenal--More artificial intelligence than in the first--Cool new accessories--Easier create modeCons:--Music SUCKS compared to the LBP1. The only good song in the entire game is in the CREDITS!  What the?--The costumes in LBP2 are largely gimmicky and over-the-top (aka not as good) compared to LBP1.--Online multiplayer is nearly unplayable on many levels due to horrific lag and even freezes up COMPLETELY at times, forcing me to do a hard restart of my PS3. Completely unacceptable.--The \"\"simple\"\" act of finding community levels is a mess--the screen is WAY too cluttered and I can't stand the way the level descriptions start scrolling, it's very difficult to read and gets very frustrating very quickly. It's way easier finding levels in LBP1, even though LBP1 isn't all that great when it comes to this either.--Often times I'll sit there thinking a level is loading because the little \"\"loading\"\" sign is spinning, but in fact all it's doing is loading the creator's stupid planet. Why do I need to see their planet? Why do I care? It's a clusterf__ck. So I sit there for a good minute before I realize the stupid level isn't even loading. They should have made the loading screens way more clear.--The \"\"arcade\"\" games do not feel like LBP. They might be cute, but they're not LBP. Lets not stray too far from the original formula, Mm. I bought this game to play as Sackboy, not to relive my Atari days.--After you complete a level there's no longer that five or so seconds to \"\"bask\"\" in the win and screw around with your friends like in LBP1.  Now it goes INSTANTLY to the rate screen.  This, in my opinion, greatly detracts from the fun.--Too simple. Way too simple.\"", "I was thoroughly impressed with the original LittleBigPlanet, so my hopes were high for LBP 2. After having played it for over a week, I can say it definitely does not disappoint. Lets get this out of the way first off - Story mode is very short, and can be beat in one night if you fly through it. That's not to say it's disappointing, however. Several new aspects are introduced to us through story mode, and the level of innovation really gets you excited for the possibilities in the new Community levels. That's where this game shines, and why it's worth the price of admission. The Create and Community features were pretty impressive in the first LBP, but they're flat-out incredible in this second installment. Virtually every improvement I could think of was implemented - the folks at Media Molecule really did pay attention to what the community wanted.One of the biggest improvements is the new music creator. In LBP 1, many people made community levels specifically for the user to ride through on an automobile of some sort to play the notes of a song. It was interesting for a while but got repetitive, and we knew there had to be a way to include an actual music creator to create background music for our levels. Well, now we got it, and it's all there - virtually every instrument and sound you can think of, to recreate your favorite song or create a new masterpiece, and insert it as the background music for your level. This is just one of many improvements made to the Create feature, and already there are hundreds of impressive new Community levels to play and rate. Once users really get comfortable with the new Create features, the sky is the limit for this game.Even if you're not big on trying to learn how to create a level, the incredible amount of high quality community levels and mini games will keep you playing this for months... and if you happen to take a break from the game for a few weeks, rest assured that when you feel the urge to play again, there will be many more new levels for you to try out. Don't forget your friends, as well! All levels in story mode and community support both online and local multiplayer. The fun never ends for everyone!Because this game will keep you coming back for more time and time again, I give it my highest recommendation.", "The Good: Wonderful art style, huge level editor, thousands of user made levels, story is a lot of fun, co-op at it's best, many different genres of gaming are introduced and are funThe Bad: Level editor is complicated and takes dedication, story is really short, some frustarting segments in the story, narrow minded players will not enjoy this, floaty physicsThere are very few games that are 100% driven by your imagination. That is the game: You. Whatever you decide or think up is what you're going to play. Impatient? You're not going to have a fun time. Don't like thinking? Look elsewhere. LBP is a game all about using the tools in the game to create your own world and idea of a fun game. LBP2 expands this by gearing the tools towards genres of games rather than just platforming. While the tool section may turn most players away, don't fret! Enjoy the thousands of well made levels from other players to keep you busy. I am not a sandbox build-it-yourself type of person, so I didn't spend much time in the editor. Open your mind and enjoy the delightful paper craft world!The story mode consists of 4 very fun worlds to play in to wet your appetite for the world and how everything works. The story is really weird and doesn't make much sense. Your only goal is to destroy the Negativitron from destroying Craftworld and you have to rescue a few people in the process. With the weird story aside, the levels are really fun and show you all the different genres of gaming you play in this game. Races, 2D shooters, platforming, fighters, and many others. Each level is completely different, but plays similarly to the last game. You have to get through each section to the next checkpoint where you can respawn if you die. The main point of the story is to find new stickers and materials for the level editor. These appear as bubbles in the game, some are easy to get, and some require a bit of puzzle solving.LBP2 is really co-op heavy and I found myself finding people to play with online or having friends join me. The game is a blast in co-op and probably the best way to play. I loved the entire story mode because it was just so much fun. Plain and simple. One level had me using different weapons like a sprinkler helmet to put out fires on platforms and grow vines into platforms. Another level used a cupcake launcher which acted as a remote mine. A later level used a few different animals as vehicles such as a bunny, hamster, and a bee was used as a schmup vehicle. It was all fun, colorful, and filled with imagination. The paper craft art style makes you feel like a kid again playing to paper and toys. LBP2 is just one of the most imaginative games you can get your hands on these days.The controls are solid, but feel a bit floaty and slide-y which is okay after you get used to it. One of my favorite features is the Pop-It which is a simplified menu you can bring up to place stickers in the world and customize your Sack Thing. If I were to really complain about the story mode it would be that some sections are ridiculously difficult and required several restarts, but nothing you won't get past. Once you beat the story mode you can either play user made levels or make your own. I won't go into the level editor because it would take 10 paragraphs just to explain, and even then you would be confused. It is more simplified than the first game, but there is more to it so it feels more complicated. I honestly could not build a single decent level so I moved on to user made levels.There are thousands of levels that are organized into categories. Ones that Media Molecule picked (which I recommend playing first) as well as levels sorted by rating. Some are pretty bad, some are spam, but some are amazing or even better than the ones on disc. Thankfully, you don't have to download these levels to your HDD so don't think you have to use precious space for all these levels like most games. I also liked you can sort by category which really brings out one of the main new features of LBP2. These user-created levels just show how powerful the tools in this game are and show how imaginative people can be. Of course it is the most fun with more people, but you can still enjoy the game by yourself.It goes to stand that a developer doesn't have to create an entire world for you to enjoy it. This is some of the most fun I have had in a game in a while and absolutely loved it. However, think carefully before buying this game. Are you a creator or player? If you are just a player you will have fun, but won't be using 80% of what's on the disc, the editor. Enough time has gone by for thousands of excellent levels to be created, so it isn't a huge loss.", "As a huge fan of the first LBP I am happy to say that this one actually tops it's predecessor!Great game play, great graphics and a hilarious storyline.Whether your 5 or 105 you will no doubt love this game.There is so much content here that it will give you hours of fun searching for it all.It leaves me really excited to see what Sony does with LBP 3!!It's also got one of the friendliest online communities around and with over 8 million online levels you are sure to find something you like! The creations the players have made are mind boggling! (Of course there are some stinkers too.)The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it will take away your time from other games!", "While I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, I still admit to having lost many hours to its numerous creations tools and user-generated stages. Straight away with LBP2, I could tell that a number of the controlling issues I hated had been addressed (although still not completely fixed). There are a great many new addictive elements added here that add to both the fun factor and the challenge factor. The story is more absorbing in this outing. I even feel that the soundtrack is better this time around. If you like puzzle games or platformers at all, or just have the desire to create something unique and offer it up to the world, then this is a game you have to own. Those of you who've played the first game will be happy to find that all of your content from LBP1 will carry over into this entry in the series. Any cons one might find in this overwhelming delight of a game would just come across as nitpicky. It's a 5 star game and a must-own. That's really all there is to it.", "Just over two years ago, the first LittleBigPlanet came out and blew some of our minds.  It first showed that the platformer wasn't dead.  Mario wasn't the only one who had staying power in the genre.  Turned out a little Sackboy could hold his own as well.  But the real joy of LittleBigPlanet was that it was a game that almost never ended.  It was a game where you could create your own levels and enjoy the creations of others.  As a result there is generally always something new to discover in the first game.  The second one is bigger, better and allows for far more creativity.  The best part about it is that anything you accomplished in the first game isn't lost.  It is carried over.  So fear not fans of the first game, your hard work isn't lost.The first game had a campaign that more or less showed you what the game was all about.  There was absolutely no story to speak of in that game.  The second one is different.  There's actually something of a narrative here.  The denizens of Craftworld are being attacked by a force only known as the Negavitron who is slowly absorbing everything in Craftworld.  It's up to your Sackperson (because you can also play as a Sackgirl this time around) to stop the Negavitron and save Craftworld. It's not much of a story, but there are actually tons of cutscenes scattered about, complete with voice acting.  And it's really good voice acting, and some of it is really funny stuff.But much like Mario, you'd have to be crazy to actually be playing LittleBigPlanet 2 because of its actual storyline.  It's all about the platforming and all about the gameplay.  The main campaign to stop the Negavitron isn't very long at all.  You'll go across six worlds, all of which have anywhere from 5 to 7 levels.  In each level you can find several objects that can be used later in create mode while plowing through the levels to see just what Media Molecule has decided to show you.  If anything the campaign here is much like the first one.  Yes, there's actually a story here, but much of what the campaign has here is showing you what you can soon create on your own.  The good news is that there's nothing here that is simply tech demo status.  There is nothing but pure creation here and many of these levels are expertly designed.  Even better is that EVERY level will throw something new at you.  One moment you're running through a basic level... the next your introduced to the grappling hook that allows you to swing across gaps.  But it doesn't end there.  You'll find yourself going into levels where you ride on furry little critters or find yourself in shooter style levels similar to those R-Type game.  No level ever feels like the previous one.There are also plenty of gadgets.  There are, of course, the grappling hooks, but you'll also find the Grabinator which allows you to pick up heavy blocks (or your allies if you're going about it co-op style) and you'll find the Cakeinator which allows you to shoot cakes that you can step on and use as platforms.  You'll also get water guns to put out burning platforms etc.  Likewise just like the first one there are certain moments in levels where you'll be given the chance to place stickers to reveal new objects you can use later on in levels.  Collecting all the objects is the challenging in LittleBigPlanet 2.  Not only are they important to use in create mode, but it shows true mastery of the game.  And there are hidden goodies in every level, many of which you'll have to play through a second time to find.  And if you want to get all of them you'll have to team up with a friend.There are, of course, a few things that LittleBigPlanet 2 still stumbles about.  As you play through the levels there are three planes you can stand on.  The background, foreground and inbetween the two.  Shifting between the two can be a pain.  Especially in puzzles that may require such.  It's a pain to lose a life simply because your Sackboy didn't switch planes like he was supposed to.  Luckily there are checkpoints scattered all around and they're most certainly a lot more lenient on the lives than the first game.  The floaty jumpy also returns, a complaint some fans had with the first game.  Personally, I was not bothered by this at all.  Especially when compared to the issue with the different planes.  It's a fun game and you'll find it's totally accessible, but one of the major means of collecting objects is going through a level without dying.  And yes, you'll find that the issue of the planes might ruin that.  You've got be precise with LittleBigPlanet 2.The other issue actually involves multiplayer.  As much fun as it is to play with friends, four of you running around at once is sure to induce the New Super Mario Bros. feeling.  It's much more tempting to want to screw one another over or turn it into a competition.  This is actually ridiculously fun, especially when you've got all the different gadgets.  You can latch on to other allies with this grappling hooks, pick them up and toss them in pits if you wish etc.  This is all fun stuff, but the downside is that if you want to get through the campaign it's easy to leave one another behind, or for things to get crowded when you want to progress further in some levels.  Multiplayer is fun, but it can also be a pain simply because you and your friends will constantly be getting in one anothers way.  You HAVE to use at least 4 players to get a hold of some of the goodies scattered about... but you'll find that a great deal of them are a lot easier to grab when there's just one player in the mix.  This is actually a minor complaint as it truly depends on who you're working with.  But the point is simple... the more friends you're playing with, the more fun (and frustrating) LittleBigPlanet 2 is apt to be.One of the big staples of the first game was the ability to create your own levels.  It's the same thing here.  What makes LittleBigPlanet's editor different from nearly every other game editor is that it actually gives you access to everything you saw in the game.  This includes vehicles, tools, landscapes, backgrounds, music, etc.  Many games--even now--that have level editors tend to limit the player somehow.  As with most things in LittleBigPlanet 2 there's an upside and a downside.  The upside, of course, is total freedom.  You can do anything you want with all these objects.  The downside is that it takes a LOT of time to learn if you didn't play the first one.  The editor is fantastic but it has a steep learning curve.  And in order to make good, competent levels you'll have to invest a lot of time, meticulously playtesting them, etc.  For many of us it's the closest we'll get to actually  being in the game design business.  For others it's too much work.  You're not FORCED to create anything, though, and you can easily spend much of your time playing the creations of other players as well as more by Media Molecule themselves.  You'll get lazy levels, of course, but you're sure to find a lot of good ones too.  There were millions of levels already created for the first game, there will surely be millions more for the second.  It'll take a lot of care and devotion just to pop out ONE great level, but I'm sure many players will find the work and the creativity liberating.As I mentioned at the beginning, your work done on the first LittleBigPlanet doesn't get lost in all this.  The costumes you unlocked in the first one will be back for you to wear and utilize in the second one.  The levels you created in the first one can still be accessed here as well.  So if you played through the first game, totally mastered it and got everything you could (as well as invested in all that downloadable content) you can use it all here.Production wise, LittleBigPlanet is nothing short of awesome.  The level designs themselves are good but so are the graphics.  The backgrounds are amazing as are some of the decorative environments.  Sure it's a 3D side scroller, but the game makes sure to utilize what it can well.  You'll see objects in the foreground and background that are amazing, you'll see cinematics that are also pretty cool and gorgeous.  It's cartoony to look at, but it's a great style.  More amazing is the sound.  The background music is absolutely fantastic and catchy.  So are some of the sound effects.  Production wise, LittleBigPlanet 2 is a technical masterpiece.Those who loved the first LittleBigPlanet are sure to love the second.  It adds a few new gadgets and is definitely bigger and better.  How much bigger is a mystery.  Until you get in there and start creating yourself (or play other creations) there are apt to be some gamers who don't realize how big a step forward the game has really taken.  The campaign, as I said, serves more as a demonstration of what you can do more so than anything.  If the campaign is all you experience I'm sure much of the new stuff you see with LittleBigPlanet 2 will come off as nothing more than bells and whistles.  But when you begin to dive into LittleBigPlanet 2--and I mean really deep--you may discover that LittleBigPlanet 2 outdoes the original in almost every way.  For those who loved the first one, the second one demands your attention.", "\"Either I was taken-in by the plethora of favorable reviews and this game is as cloyingly awful as I think it is, or else I have a seasonal disorder and when the sun comes out again I will realize it was way better then I thought.  I'm leaning towards the former.Maybe this would be good to play with some young kid(s). For me the gameplay was trite, the controls overly-complex, the audio at times indecipherable, and it was anything but \"\"submersive.\"\" I'm looking for a game in which to lose myself. With this game I was looking at the clock all the time an wondering if there was anything on PBS.To be fair, I enlisted a 10 year-old child. \"\"Dumb\"\" was the assessment.I can't see going much younger, because knowing there's a two-key combo to re-size the stickers to place them on the sticker frame, while the hint \"\"Press R to flip\"\" blinks at you annoyingly seems a bit more than a typical child (let alone a middle-aged man) can tolerate.I'm thinking a marketing conspiracy when the average of 80+ reviews is almost all 5 stars.  We'll see if my review even gets maintained...\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.044441644102334976, 0.05212114378809929, 0.07625889033079147, 0.04697617143392563, 0.10258137434720993, 0.05523286014795303, 0.07735401391983032, 0.0574907511472702, 0.03443658724427223, 0.05974261462688446, 0.047086723148822784, 0.007455514278262854, 0.060617342591285706, 0.001991845201700926, 0.02117258869111538, 0.042122095823287964, 0.014518620446324348, 0.07084056735038757, 0.04738837108016014, 0.02380400337278843, 0.056366316974163055]]}
