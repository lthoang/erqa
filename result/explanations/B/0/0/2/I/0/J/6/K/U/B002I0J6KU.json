You get to shimmy up the back of cyclopses (which Chrome argues is not a word, but I prefer it to cyclopsi or cyclopseses {although the latter is more fun to say}) and stab them to death, shimmy up the back of griffons and stab them to death, and shimmy up the back of golems (okay, Chrome, why is GOLEMS not a word?  WTF?) and -- you guessed it! -- stab them to death.There's not much to say; quest-givers mostly ask you to kill or collect a finite number of things, to escort them to ridiculously dangerous locations halfway across the world (seriously, somebody named a place Bloodwater Beach and PEOPLE ASK TO GO THERE), and complete the odd story quest.But this all belies the actual charm of \"\"Dragon's Dogma,\"\" which is the fact that while ostensibly an online game, where you create a slave and share it with the rest of the world while hiring others' slaves to assist your quest to save the world...  You never deal with other people.That's right.  All the hiring of others' slaves is done without talking to those people.  You just find them (slaves, I mean, not the other people whom I just said you never interact with) wandering around or in MagicLand RiftTown, pay some ghost dollars, and get the slaves.  No muss, no fuss, no 13 year old jagaloon throwing racial slurs your way.And that's why I love \"\"Dragon's Dogma.\"\"  Because I don't have to risk talking with anyone.  I don't have people questioning my sexuality, making insinuations about my mother's promiscuity (or lack thereof), or explaining my ancestral heritage.  I don't have \"\"people\"\" screaming like howler monkeys in the background, bodily functions into microphones, or terrible music blaring.  No blatantly obvious statements, idiotic questions, or any other aural nonsense.\"\"Dragon's Dogma\"\" offers cooperation without having to cooperate.  It's awesome.Plus, I threw a princess off the top of the castle and fought the town guard.Absolutely recommended.\"", "\"...I like it. It doesn't hold a candle to Dark Souls (I'm not even sure why Dark Souls keeps coming up in the conversation), but it's a relaxing adventure which holds little interest beyond a first playthrough for non-trophy-hunters.Dragon's Dogma concerns the adventures of a nameless character (called the Arisen), as he battles to win back his physical heart from a nameless dragon (called, apparently, the Dragon). I have no idea what the dogma of this dragon is. Most likely, a developer/localization team just thought the word \"\"dogma\"\" sounded cool.The game is a 3rd person affair. You have the choice of 3 initial classes, but this later extends to 9 (6 pure classes, and 3 hybrid classes, assuming my memory serves me). You can pretty much switch classes at will. In fact, this is key to creating the best possible character, stat-wise, in the game, but nothing in the game actually tells you this, and truthfully, it's not that important. You also have helper characters, called Pawns. One pawn is your creation, and you have pretty good control over him/her. For example, you can choose his/her class (although I think pawns only have access to 6 classes). In addition, you are allowed to hire 2 more pawns, of which you have little control. Basically, these pawns fill in the gaps for your party. If you have a friend who has played the game, you can hire that pawn for free. This causes severe balancing issues in the game - I advise against it, unless you are looking for a quick path to platinum. You can also send your pawn out for hire. As s/he progresses, she will learn abilities against particular enemies, and knowledge about particular quests, even if you've never seen these enemies/quests before, which is helpful.Battle is...frenetic. Enemies will swarm you, and your pawns will often do much of the work (particularly on an initial playthrough). Later, you will encounter huge, boss-like enemies that are more readily dispatched with special tactics. It's quite fun, but it can be difficult, particularly if you stray off the road and run into an enemy you are not prepared for.The story is laughably stupid. It's not terrible. It's just...stupid. However, you'll probably lose interest, unless you're a fanboy-in-the-making.The single biggest problem in the game is the difficulty of movement in the overworld. While there is a teleport feature, it's horrible. You have access to a very limited number of gate-type stones (I think you have one, in fact, for most of the game), and the warp stones necessary to utilize them also cost money. If you play through a few times, you see why the developers did this. The game is very short if you have warp speed between towns. I think I beat the whole thing in around 7 hours without really trying, and under 5 when I was trying.There are some bonuses as well. I particularly liked the online dragon. If you play him offline, he's a relatively tough enemy who gives you good loot after defeating him. If you fight him while playing online, he is a holy terror who will likely rip you to shreds unless you have gone through serious preparation. The loot he drops in his online form is awesome (including special armor and masks off legendary heroes such as Beowulf and St. George). I beat him twice myself, which I why I know of those two particular masks.However, outside of this, there is little reason to play the game past an initial playthrough. Unlike Dark Souls, whose New Game + is a great experience, there is absolutely no change in the enemies level or power. You will cut through everything the game has to offer, and if you use your money to purchase gate-type stones (I think they were called \"\"Rift Stones\"\"), you will blow through subsequent playthroughs in record time.For twenty bucks, though, it's not a bad game. I think its \"\"sequel\"\" Dark Arisen was a free game on PS+. Happy gaming!\"", "This game did something that not many others have done: It kept me drawn in until the very end.I will be concise, since so many others have written terrific reviews.POSITIVES:-A twist on genre.  No ground-breaking, as it were, but the subtle differences...well, make all the difference-The extended gameplay.  The game continues to give, in terms of gameplay.-Multiple classes you can play as.  Slight combos of the traditional warrior/mage/ranger-The pawn system.  You can really customize your team of warriors, and they are actually useful in battle.-Variability in combat. E.G. Mage combat is so different from warrior.Negatives:-In my honest opinion, the only thing that annoys me about this game is that at the end of the game, you really are required to use a lantern because of the darkened atmosphere.-I would appreciate some more armor/goodies to find and use, but that is a trivial thing.Some people aren't fans of the lack of a fast-travel system.  I, at first, was annoyed.  Then, I began getting into the game, and I realized that the required time spent walking place to place is part of the magnificence of the storyline-of the fun.  You encounter monsters in their natural habitat.  Sure, you will see the same group of bandits again and again, so what?  Part of the fun is trying different ways to destroy them!  Also, it extends the gameplay in a very pleasurable manner.  I know for Skyrim I spent all my time fast-traveling, and thus didn't discover many of the game's little secrets.  You WILL find things in DD.Overall, this is a very engaging game, with a lot of fun quirks and a great combat system.  My favorite part of the game is how it continues to give and give, even after you think the game is over.", "I bought Skyrim expecting a nice open world game with fun mechanics and combat, but it fell way short. What I always wanted was a large open world RPG with Dark Souls combat and now I have it.Dragon's Dogma won't win any awards for graphics, but it look good enough. The frame rate is good, no tearing and the install is clever, it only caches data if your HD has room. The Pawn system is brilliant, you make a main pawn which people online can use and earn you rewards. You can also barrow two other pawns that others have made. So you can make a great party and change it anytime you want. Your main character can also learn other classes and use other equipment starting at level 10, so if you don't like using a sword, change to a mage or strider or assassin, etc. Anyhow, the star of the game is the combat. The boss monsters are epic and you really feel a great sense of accomplishment every time you kill a large beast.", "love this game. its got great action and i like the story. also its an open rpg. i loved this game.", "The story line is unlike any I have played before. It was very creative and open. This game claims 300 hours of game play, not the case. It is a classic RPG in which you also have a personal partner with 2 interchangeable partners. It has a total worth (only counting one playthrough) of approximately 60-70 hours if everything is done. Still really good on hours considering it is fairly cheap at this point but not the amount promised. There is one major hitch in the game. Travel is lacking. It takes forever to get from place to place and everywhere you go you get to walk for basically the whole game. You can teleport to the main city and one other location but basically that is the main catch in the game. If you do buy, remember to save often and have fun.", "I have always love action RPG'S ever since playing Demons Souls. Finding out that the people behind Devil May Cry are behind the awesomeness that is Dragons Dogma. I just jump right into it. I have nothing but great things to say that this. Combat is fun. Day to night creeps me out. Love the dungeon aspects about it. Still playing it and trying to get every weapon and find all the dungeon. Not to mention kill every baddie i can. 100 STARS.", "A very fun game with amazing gameplay. I think it's a yes or no game, you'll love it and spend a thousand hours or you''ll bin it after 20, Dragon's Dogma's story centers around a fisherman/woman (You'll spend 2 hours customizing your character!) whose heart gets ripped out for no good reason. Being quite upset with this traumatic experience, you then embark on your quest: to attain lv 200 with a gigantic wardrobe and become GOD! No really, I'm being truthful...in short, story doesn't matter, it's all about you grinding out xp and looting gear, which you must upgrade 5 times and give to your pawn.(your npc-slave who's the game-in-the-game) and man, you'll do just that. Gameplay is mesmerizing, npc's quirky, customization in skills, clothes, weapons enormous...unlocked a new skill? Well, you know what to do, go kill 5 quintillion harpies to learn your pawn how to use it. Found a hat? Well, you'll have to kill 5 drakes to dragonforge it! :D It's great guys and the ending is very beautiful and fulfilling.PS, the Bitterback DLC is best tackled after lv 100, nasty beasties there!Thx 4 reading, Geert", "horrible game. like reading a book one page an hour. cut scenes galore. no fluidity at all. Stay away from this game!", "The game is really very good, very different than anything I've played before, but it shares elements with other titles like Demon's Souls, Monster Hunter and Skyrim.The travel system is poorly conceived, and walking through the same fixed backdrops over and over gets tedious quickly, but there are environmental quests that occasionally pop up and that part is good, but extremely limited, object-based fast travel and no mounts? I don't get it.The pawns talk way too much, and you cant set options of any pawn besides the main one, and there is no way to shut them up without turning off voices.Quest system is not great either, same old kill or carry type of thing you've seen a thousand times before, but you have to walk across a huge map without easy fast travel to do them.Save system is totally screwed..seriously. One save slot, I guess to stop crystal farming, but I just lost 35 hours because the save file became corrupted. I did not even dream that something like that could happen, but after looking around on the Internet this is a common problem, and you have to back up saves on a flash drive to protect yourself from this issue, which is just stupid..Great game with some flaws, but the save system really ruined the experience for me", "Well i finally beat the game and the added bitterblack isle part thats new to dragons dogma and its definitely not easy at all. I logged about 80 hours playing the game and it was great but the lag really ruined it for me when there was lots of action on the screen. I also want to say that the 2nd form of daimon and death are way too overpowered, but still i hope capcom makes another rpg like this game or a sequel to dark arisen.", "Let me start off by saying that Dragon's Dogma is not a perfect game (if such a thing exists) but for every flaw, there's a welcome surprise.The game is highly immersive with an exciting combat system and interesting world to explore. The quests are rarely outside-the-box, but the familiarity is comforting with so many other innovations. All dialogue is fully voiced and for the most part, well done.You are given access to create your own pawn (follower) and may borrow 2 others from friends or strangers. This is where the game really shines. Leveling and specializing your pawn, to share with the world, is a joy. Finding just the right pawns from other people is rewarding and fun.In short... if you love great games - pick this one up.", "\"Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen it technically an expansion to the original Dragon's Dogma but features the full, original game as well.  Dark Arisen offers a new island to explore that is difficult for those who haven't already delved into the game prior.Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is an open world, 3rd person, action/rpg where players are given a variety of vocations, or classes, that offer different methods of fighting.-The three basic classes are Fighter, Strider (archer), and Mage.  The rest of the classes are either an expansion of the base class or a hybrid of the other classes; Warrior for Fighter, Ranger for Strider, and Sorcerer for Mage.  The hybrids are Assassin (Fighter/Strider), Mystic Knight (Fighter/Mage), and Magick Archer (Strider/Mage).  Each vocation is fun and offers varied play styles.- The player is always accompanied by a \"\"Pawn\"\", a side-kick NPC that can be given instructions and can change vocations as well, though they do not receive access to the hybrid classes.-The character creation is quite in depth with many, many options.  The pawns have the same amount of depth so you can craft your perfect pair.  The only thing I found annoying is the different voices are not really different.  It's the one actor/actress and the original recording is simply modified to be higher or lower and then called another \"\"voice\"\" option.  I consider this a big deal since the pawns talk... often.-The party can consist of up to 4, the player, their main pawn, and two additional pawns from other players.  Their pawn can also be enlisted by other players and will bring home items occasionally when they are utilized.-The story is very shallow and often quite obvious.  There are a few interesting twists, but overall someone looking for an in-depth, intelligent storyline should look elsewhere.  The writing is terrible and the main character is devoid of any life.-The actual game play is quite fun.  The action combat is what really makes this game shine.  Controls are responsive and using abilities is satisfying.-There are not \"\"invisible walls\"\" in the game; you can go anywhere you want from the onset.  However, if you're not high enough level, death will come often.-Because of the open world nature of the game, auto saves are few and far between.  Often mainly coming when the player enters/exits a building or city that requires a loading screen.  Also when sleeping.  Remember to save often as you can potentially lose hours of gameplay!-The visuals are nice, but certainly not top of the line.  They get the job done and I felt like the overall look fit with the theme and story well.-There are a lot of weapon and armor options that allow a unique look for each character as well as allowing for focusing on different abilities and resistances (such as higher poison resistance).Differences between original and the expansion:-Quicker load times - much quicker.-Easier \"\"fast travel\"\" via Ferrystones - it is much easier and cheaper to acquire Ferrystones now-New items, weapons, armor, skills, and monsters-Pawns, however, as are annoying as always!  (\"\"There may be treasure hidden about.\"\")Gameplay is 4/5 and the story is a 2/5.  If you want a great action game that you can get lost in for many hours, this is worth the purchase.  There is a new game plus that offers a degree of replayability, but with all vocations being available to the player, it's still limited as the story is not worth a second play through.\"", "Playing the same thing over and over.  I was not happy with it.  Some good parts but the bad out weighed the good.  Its a shame.  This could have been the next Dragon Age.", "If you like games likes dark souls and demon's souls but you don't want such a steep learning curve or challenge, dragon's dogma is a good alternative.", "Hi,I bought this game for my 2wks off at Christmas.  I had it once and liked it but found it too hard.  I decided to give it another shot.First off all you get to pick your character, a pawn you get to keep, and 2 other pawns that you can swap out as your level increases as the two loaner ones levels don't increase.I found for me it works best to have an arrow shooter because their are some airborne enemies and some that are safer to fight from a distance.  Later on when you reach a certain level like 15 or 20 you can change two a hybrid class and I picked assasian and was able to wield a one handed sword and arrow.Also I found it best if you keep you party balance.  I get 1 two handed wielding warrior, 1 mage, and my pawn is a 1 handed wielding sword person, I think soldier but not sure.Anyway, also you can enhance weapons at the vendors and you use items from fallen foes and found around the world.  Also don't forget to upgrade your main support pawn weapons that is always with you.When you go this route.  So far I have been able to beat any foes I encounter.  Thats not to say that I don't die or have a challenge.  But the 1st time I got it I spent a whole day to try and beat a chimera.  This way I can beat a chimera and about anything so far in a few minutes.  The hardest for me was the drake.  But I beat it in a few minutes.Now I haven't faced everything yet I am level 40 with about 33hrs in.Now the game runs pretty flawless.The graphics are great and the combat is really fast and much more fun than any other rpg I have played.  The weapons have real weight to them.  Also when I am traveling I run most the way and this game doesent slow down and I play for about 5hrs straight.The character customization is great too.  You can make your character and pawn male or female.The quests are cool as well as the locations.  Some of the quests are a little vague on how to do them, but with a little thought you should be ok.  I know a few of them it seemed the map didn't show me where to go and I had to kind of look for a little clue from a particular quest that you get an item that is needed for another quest or the pawns if they have done the quest before with another user will give info.Oh yah the 2 support pawns belong to other as their created support pawn and they are in the rift when you are online.  So when you do quests with them they bring back rift crystals and items from quests with other users.  Rift crystals are used to buy pawns above your level.  Ones at your level are free.Anyway, so far really loving this game.  If you are just starting out and have trouble try a different loadout, or you can try it on easy until you get your characters built up and the hang of how to fight the enemies.Thanks,Kevinedit 1/1/2013Just finished the main story of the game, skipped a lot of side quests and have not done any post game stuff.  Took me about 36 hrs level 47.Kevin", "The problem with this game is the length of gameplay. My boyfriend got through the main story in two days. That's exceedingly short when you compare it to the Skyrims and Final Fantasys out there. But I loved the concepts of Dragon's Dogma. The game was extremely detailed and I loved having my own character AND my own helper. I think the idea of having your helper play with other people and learn about quests before you played them was pretty neat. It's definitely worth a play and I've heard that some DLC is coming out to help with the length of the game.", "\"Fantastic game so far, been playing since I got it a week ago, and seem to be somewhat addicted.  After playing Skyrim and hating how horrible the controls are, this game is fantastic for providing the open world RPG that I was looking for with controls that are responsive and quick, and have quite a number of skills for each class to play with.  Highly recommend, reminds me of an open world Dragon Age, which to me is a great thing.Update:Well, I logged on my game shortly after this review was posted to get a big error saying \"\"Your save game is corrupt, would you like to start a new one?\"\"  after....a good 60+ hours invested, no, i did not want to make a new game.  Sold it the next day.  Unfortunate, that it was a fun game, but no way i'm putting the time back into it when out of the blue the save game corrupted.  Make sure you copy your save game to a USB device every couple days!\"", "\"In my opinion, all the pieces of a great game are present here- inventory, levels, perks, weapons, magic, crafting and open world adventure, but they don't seem to fit together in a cohesive way, as say, in Dark Souls, Skyrim, Fallout, etc.  I never felt as if I had complete understanding of all the strange little aspects of the game.  \"\"I'm a soldier but I can only use certain swords? And no bow?\"\"  Where can I learn magic spells?  I'm warned about the dangers of going out at night, but what time is it?  Is there any way to tell?  And why do I die when I touch the water- even a small stream?  I like picking through my inventory but I've accumulated literally HUNDREDS of items that take me forever to go through, try to combine with other things, etc.  It's fun but takes forever, and takes away from the active exploring/questing.  Wandering around in the \"\"open world\"\" is fine by me, but all I found out there were lots of rock barriers, cliffs (not very \"\"open\"\" world at all) and bandits and creatures to fight.  I want more from exploring the \"\"open world\"\" than fights and feeling penned in by cliffs and rock walls.  The battles are epic, sure, but there's nothing skillful about it.  Hack n slash until your hands are numb.  The game really has its moments of greatness (eg catacombs, etc.)and I really gave this game the benefit of the doubt for a while, but it didn't seem to grab me like so many similar games have.  In my opinion, overall this is not \"\"GREAT\"\" game and we shouldn't lower our standards of what a great game truly is.  Dragon's Dogma is having its fifteen minutes of fame because it is available now when not much else is out there- that's why I played it anway, and it's ok at best.  They can't all be zingers.\"", "If you love rpgs and haven't tried this yet, shame on you!!! What are you waiting for? The game is fantastic!!", "Just like what most of the reviews said, this game is a smorgasbord of excellence. Mixing in recipes found in Monster Hunter, Shadow Of Colossus, Skyrim, and Fable you actually get something that works quiet well. The story isn't the best thing ever, but man does the gameplay make up for it. If I'd known just how great Dragon's Dogma is I'd have picked it up sooner. A definite gamer must!", "\"Dragon's Dogma, like Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, which released around the same time, is an epic, Western-style role playing game that has a strong focus on real time action combat. In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to call both of these titles action games with RPG elements. But while the two titles look quite similar on paper, they couldn't be more different. Dragon's Dogma is developed by Capcom, a Japanese studio, and the game still has deep roots in Japanese gaming despite being a Western RPG through and through.One thing that has to be mentioned right away is that Dragon's Dogma has its share of issues. It's an incredibly ambitious game whose ambitions were far greater than the hardware it was made for. Technical issues such as texture pop-in and chugging frame rates are common. Character facial animations, particularly during scenes of dialogue, are quite lifeless. The menu system can be quite unwieldy and non-intuitive. Even after 50 hours into the game, I was still finding myself fumbling around the menus at times. The game's fast travel system, despite being improved for this Dark Arisen edition, is still one of the most poorly executed in any game of this type that I've ever played. Dragon's Dogma is a game that reached for the stars, and despite being a valiant attempt, especially for Capcom's first foray into this type of game, is still quite rough around the edges.Despite this, Dragon's Dogma is a game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to fans of action games and WRPGs. I loved the game.Dragon's Dogma has a sense of adventure about it that no other Western RPG I've played this generation has (and I've played nearly all of them). The world of Gransys is huge and ripe for exploration, yet this never comes without significant risk. Like the classic Japanese RPG's of the 90's, setting off on foot someplace that you aren't adequately prepared and leveled up for will result in your swift death. The day/night cycle of Gransys also plays a huge part of the experience, as the nighttime becomes extremely dangerous. Gransys is a fantastic game world, filled with epic vistas, diverse landscapes, and secrets everywhere.I would have to say that the one area where Dragon's Dogma trumps all of its competition is in combat. And this isn't referring just to the combat controls (which are fantastic), but to the way combat scenarios unfold in the field. Imagine the free-form dance that is The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's combat, combined with the tightly-tuned yet flexible controls of something like the old Devil May Cry titles, and that is what you have here. Dragon's Dogma provided me with some of the most thrilling battle sequences I've ever experienced in a video game, period.Battles have this sense of \"\"anything goes\"\" and can often become chaotic quite quickly if you aren't prepared. Thankfully, you will always have the aid of your Pawns, your AI controlled partners-for-hire who I found to have some of the best AI I've ever come across in a party-based RPG. Thanks to the diverse skill sets of my Pawns, I was always being healed when I needed to be, my weapons were always buffed appropriately, and the appropriate tactics were always applied to emerge victorious. The Pawns in Dragon's Dogma are a fantastic innovation in partner AI. The Pawn system especially comes to life with its multiplayer functionality, allowing you to loan your pawn to people on your friends list, and also allowing you to borrow theirs for no cost.Rounding out the game's high points are an excellent class system that eventually lets you form custom classes to suit your liking, a story that starts out somewhat bland yet becomes extremely intriguing after a wild turn of events in the last quarter of the game, excellent voice acting, and TONS of stuff to do. I spent about 50 hours with the main campaign, and that was skipping lots of side quests and not even touching the Dark Arisen expansion content. The creature design is something that is worth a mention as well, as it is stellar. Many of your non-human enemies have a stop-motion look to them that seems more realistic than other RPG's I've played, and the ability to attack them in a variety of ways, including lunging at and climbing up their bodies to hack at weak points, adds to the scope and epic feel of the battles described earlier.Dragon's Dogma is a great game despite its rough spots. It's an ambitious, unique RPG that is not only extremely thrilling and fun to play, but has a grand sense of adventure that really sets it apart. A no-brainer for fans of this genre.\"", "I loved Lord of the Rings: War in the North.  I've been looking for a game that could bring  what it brought along with something new...Dragon's Dogma does just that!  I love the pawn system and the ability to traverse the open world.  The game reminds me of a mix of LOTR and Skyrim.  I've got plenty more things to do but after hours of gameplay I am hooked! If you like action rpgs this is the one for you!", "If there is one thing Dragon Dogma is heads and shoulders above many other Western RPG, it's the combat mechanics. Top-tier, well-executed and every class plays differently. You're not punish by your creativity and it's a very good game to immense yourself in the world.Great OST at the menu title too. Love it", "Dark Arisen is a great game. I never played the original. The graphics are awesome, and the gameplay is terrific. This is an open world, and you can go everywhere. I was surprised how easy it was to get to the capitol city. There are good shops in the capitol. Also, as the player completes main quests, new equipment becomes available. There are also merchants at other locations, and it is a wise thing to visit them.Combat is great. I played a Warrior with a healer Mage as my main pawn. You can recruit pawns easily at your own level or below without the need for rift crystals. The special attacks for my warrior were awesome, and spells look great. Fighting huge enemies is also fun.There are quite a few quests to keep you busy. Some will take you on longer journeys. There is a lot of combat just wandering around. Nighttime is awesome! Your pawns never cease talking, mostly, so you never feel alone. Equipment upgrades are very cool.I really liked this game. Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is a great game to play.", "The game is good, you can get it for free on the PS Plus membership, its a different rpg experience with great fighting actions, but there are better RPG games out there", "This is really a great game. Several reviews have covered the reasons why. Here are some of my pros/cons.Pros+The ability to climb onto creatures. This is just fun and different. To scale onto the back of a Chimera during battle to hack at the snake tails is something rarely seen in games. Nice touch. Try climbing onto an oxen. Its like mutton bustin'!+The pawns are cool. Interesting touch to know your pawn is being used by someone else.+Beautiful landscape+Variety of weapons and armor+fun combat (I hate God of War type combat)+fairly large open land to explore+decent amount of side quests to keep you busy+variety of monsters. Goblins get old but they have a great variety of levels of each creature and a variety of creatures. Big ones...that you can climb on to fight.Cons-Big one for me is the one character slot. You get the current saved game and that is it. I started a ranger and wanted to try a warrior instead. Erase everything and start over. This one knocked a whole star of fun out of the game for me.-Changing of current skills can only be done at the inn or specific places. Why? I understand the PS3 controller is limited. I get that. Let me reassign my quick use spells on the fly though. I find out I'm fighting undead? Let me switch things out so I can access my Holy powers since I had outfitted for Cold.-Fast travel is limited. I think a great way to add some fast travel to this game would be the Rift system already in use for hiring pawns. You are apparently already in this other plane of existence, let me come out at some other Rift stone in the game. It gets tiresome running through the same rocky canyon over and over fighting the same set of goblins that are always in the same spot. There is some fast travel via ferrystones, but they only take you back to the main city or to another stone that you can acquire.-Money system. What are these? Pennies? It costs 500 gold pieces to stay the night at the inn? Small rant but still couldn't they have knocked a zero off somewhere to make it a bit more realistic? I know, its fantasy...I waited for this to drop off the 60 bucks level and it is now well worth the money. Lots of game-play in this one.", "This game is amazing. It was my first time playing (did not play original Dragon's Dogma). The game is very interesting and i like most things about it (don't like my stamina draining). The game is beautiful, i don't like the fact that you don't get any warnings with your quests, as in if you move along with the story, your current side-quests will get locked or cancelled for the rest of the current playthrough. I was scared to play this game, with the fact that everything was killing me. But many Ur Dragons later I'm high enough levels to knock out Daimon without breaking a sweat. The game has a nice story, characters seem to come and go, monsters keep spawning and ... oh God please don't let it be dark............Cool game, having a blast destroying my once 'too powerful' enemies on New Game+ being that you keep the current level and equipment that you beat the game on.", "\"Well, The game is well made, No glitches yet that I can see. It is entertaining, and fun to play. However, People around me cannot stand the voice acting! One of my pawns voice sounds to masculin for a women. The English accents sound fake..The merchant in Gran Soren sounds like he is auditioning to replace Ringo in the Beatles! You constantly hear the same repeated lines..\"\" Fire, It `Ates it\"\" (Hates)\"\"Strength in number ,Arisen!\"\"I wish that part was done a little better.The game is still wonderful and worth the time put in!\"", "At first I thought this game was an mmo so I dismissed it. When I heard it was an rpg I laughed at the thought of Capcom attempting one. Then I saw footage of characters scaling dragons in-flight and made a beeline to Amazon.Although the story and characters aren't particularly interesting, the game is truly amazing. The combat is extremely exhilarating and rivals/surpasses the greatest of 3rd person action games. There are 9 classes to choose from and switching them is extremely easy should you decide that sorcery, swordplay, etc. is not for you. There is also a pawn system that has you creating and raising a companion who can also be used and rated by other players online.Best of all (for me) is the customization. This game has one of the best, most extensive and satisfying character creation system I've ever used in a game. I know this will sound alarming to some and may even warrant a friendly visit from the FBI, but my character was a 12 year old girl. Scaling 20 foot cyclops to stab them in their eye, clinging to dragons mid-flight Beowulf style, skillfully dispatching an entire clan of bandits with string hooks and firecrackers, drop kicking orcs in the face, all as a 12 year old girl is as ridiculous as it is fun.I highly recommend this game.", "\"this is a truly excellent game with some really epicfights. be warned though, you may die frequently especally at night when it seemsall the things that go bump in the night are bumping more so then usualthe nice part is you can save at any time.the story isn't anythng special but serves well enough to get you into the game.this game, unlike others does no hand holding at allso you will not be treated to the usual tutorial orany such standard RPG mechanics.the battle system is fluidand really fun to experiment with. the mages do really get strong aftersome grinding (you will grind a lot in this game) I built my characterto be a \"\"Mystic Knight\"\" basicly a Warrior Mage hybrid. it seems to be a weaker classthough I have jolly good times climbing upon the likes of a cyclops andstabbing him in his big old eye thus making him a bit chaoticfor a time where he even covers his face. the fighting is much more fluidthen in the demo which I thought was good but needed polish.well the game has been polished quite nicely so most of the bugs you encounteredin the demo are not present here. (thankfully)it's a little tough to get going since you have no idea where anything is and also do not know the map,thus your first few adventures may be harder then you expectedespecally when the quest marker is not being very helpful (I followed my quest objective into a city and upon going in it pointed behind me)the pawns are a godsend though with better A.I. then I have seen inan RPG in a very very long time. they heal you, fight the monsters(a little zealously sometimes which leads to either death or another battle)the pawns not only support your actions but actually assist very welland their comments on the huge beasts weaknesses are most welcome! they also pick up items and give them to you. you also get a Main Pawn that will lvl up with you throughout the adventure and you may Hire using Rift Crystals up to Two Support Pawns that will Not gain levels with the party. they bring loot and info back to their masters. your pawn will be the same when \"\"rented out\"\" though while rented he will still be at your side so you're never without your main Pawn (unless he \"\"dies\"\")the loot is a bit more sparse then I was getting from the videos butit's not a big problem. the stores sell loads of items and Innssell Skill Upgrades where you expand upon your skill tree depending on your choicesthe strider class is your \"\"rogue\"\" class with loads of nifty abilities (like invisibility). the mage is a AoE + Healing support style character.you may also re-spec your points at almost any time (for a price)the environments may seem bland at first but they soon are filled with lifeand thgis life is intelligent too so beware of brigands that mightset a trap for you (like the rolling boulder shown in the vids)or a dragon might come crashing through the trees and this above allcreates Tension throughout the adventure, which leads to caution.caution is wise here as your pawns can \"\"die\"\" if one does it's sent back to the \"\"rift\"\" where they come from. your main pawn may be resummoned from the rift if he or she dies. support pawns cost Rift Crystals to aquire and the more crystalsyou have the better class of pawns you can hire.overall this game is a Must Buy for Hack & Slash fans and action RPG fans aliketheres loads of content and the map is Huge, be ready to cough up some rare lootto fast travel though (No one rides for free I guess lol)not only are the pawns quite smart, so are the baddies they will flank you, use long range to their advantage and annoy big monsters to lure then to you.(so evil of them...) renting pawns is done through a rift stone 9they're scattered everywhere it seems) and a quest awaits you around every corner.some of which take you underground into caves and labyrinths filled with the dead (some of which can posses party members lol) you must use a lantern in these dark places and you'll need to be sure to bring loads of Lantern Oil.enemy types are quite varied with quite a few that will be easily identified byRPG'rs and D&D; fans. the enemies range from standard fare goblins on up to Chimera,Harpies, Evil Eye (think Beholder) Hydra, Cyclops, Trolls, Ogres and moreall for you to climb on and give a beating (provided you have the stamina which is important in this game)Some NG+ infoyou get Portstones (which can be bought at the black cat in NG+) too which help a ton. (lets you set a spot to use ferrystones to Go to!)you get one of these at the top of blue moon tower.and at the end, the game IS NOT OVER! it's not only got NG+ (new game+)but it has endgame content only available After beating the game. so there's Tonsto do. also they keep adding new quests and other stuff via DLCthe game is a blast if you're hesitating about picking it up, don't.I haven't had this much fun with an RPG in years.I'd recommend being at least lvl 50 before going for the end.it's not due to the end boss rather, it will be eternal nightafter the \"\"final Battle\"\" and is extreamly difficult. so be ready andwell equipped.this game seems to be going back to\"\"the good ole days\"\" of RPG's. I was shocked to see almost no fast travel (and I love it) (well, there IS fast travel but you need Ferrystones that you find (rarely) and they're extreamly valuable. also for resurrection you need Wakestones that you find in shards and need Three to Resurrrect your character. while this may sound difficult, it's great to use in times of dire need.) but I find it refreshing since it really makes you explore the whole world and as such, makes the game last longer (and the sun setting much more scary lol) also from the good ole days is the Lantern! How surprised I was at actually having to use the lantern in the dark (most games I turn the gamma up and I'm fine, not here though) and of course the brutal difficulty. it really makes me feel like I am playing old days D&D.; I just love the game and it's exactly what I have been looking for on the ps3. I will sum it up in two words: Simply Stellar!Gameplay: 4 of 5 stars due to the lack of a lock on. climbing is fun though.Graphics: nicely polished and interesting locations 5 of 5 starsSound: an excellent score backs up the sound of combat 4 of 5Controls: fairly easy to learn, menus can be a pain to navigate 5 of 5 starsFun: the game is a blast whether you're climbing a hydra lopping off it's heads one by one or bashing the undead in dark caverns. the battle system really makes the game shine. 5 of 5 starsOverall: a must buy for RPG and Action RPG fans it will not fail to please.5 of 5 stars\"", "Lately I've been getting into some rpgs for the PS3. I've finished Dragon Age Origins and its sequel. I may have had some issues with Dragon Age 2 but I have gotten over them and have actually come to like it a bit more than origins, but I was tired of replaying the game and romancing Fenris over and over again so I needed something else to play lol. I saw Dragon's Dogma and decided to pick it up after reading the many good reviews here.What I liked about the game:Game play is great. It's fast paced and I love the epic boss fights. The grab system is awesome, so much so that I hope BioWare take a look at what Capcom did and use it for the next dragon age game. I got a real sense of teamwork out of the pawns, watching my pawn hold an enemy down while I slice it up was awesome. Being able to climb on top of a huge beast and hack at it was amazing! The Pawn system was also well done. I like sharing pawns and getting rewards for it. The open world is huge with lots of NPCs to talk to. Some of the clothes and armor is well designed.Update Note: While the pawns do work well together with the grab system, I sort of wish Capcom has set up some sort of tactics settings. Those rare moments when the pawns are targeting the same enemy as me were wonderful! too bad they tend to spread out charging at any enemy nearby instead of working as a solid force.Now what I hated about the game:Too much slow mo in the Gameplay. I felt like I was in episode of Spartacus. The first few times were awesome but after having to fight the wave after wave of enemies it wore very thin. The pawns are annoying and uninteresting, all they do is prattle on about a lot of nothing. Sometimes they give useful tips which is why I don't mute it but the majority of it is just yammering on about a lot of nothing. They need to take a cue from BioWare and give us interesting banter.Update Note: You can turn off the slow mo cinematic in the combat which is awesome!The open world is huge yet their travel system sucks! This is perhaps my biggest issue with this game, no horses, donkeys or wagons that can take me from one place to another. I can understand areas that aren't revealed but having to keep traveling all over the map on foot with an effect on stamina feels like a chore and makes simple quests take longer than they should, which is why I started to just skip some of them. Having to fight re-spawned monsters, bandits, and wolves while trying to travel makes me very unhappy and sometimes they all cluster together which means you could end up fighting all of them at the same time! I once had a huge Griffon(boss), some bandits, wolves, and harpies all after me and watching my character slow down to huff and draining my inventory using stamina pots trying to run away well...It's not fun and is just more work and all of this while trying to get to the location of a quest. Having to fight random boss fights in the middle of all of this ticks me off. Sure the boss fights are epic but they become a pain when done randomly.Update Note: I just want to add that the game does offer Ferrystones that automatically take you to Gran Soren (main city in the game) and they can take you anywhere on the map provided that you've placed down a port crystal. This cuts travel time down a lot. Only one major problem. You don't even get a port crystal until halfway in the game and you have to run all the way to the location you want to put it at,they seem to be rare, and you can't have them duplicated by the forgery guy in Gran Goren (or you can but it doesn't even work.Inventory system is a pain, just let me share one inventory with my group and be done with it. The save file system sucks too. An RPG that doesn't allow me to have multiple save files?? wth?! Today I actually stopped playing because I saved my game before doing something, it didn't turn out like I thought and decided to go back to where I last saved. Turned out it sent me back several hours in my game play. which meant that I had to do all the traveling I did all over again, finish the same quest all over again, and place the portcrystal where I wanted it all over again. No way am I doing that. It just seems like work and not a game I am having fun with. I do believe that if capcom fixes some of these issues they will have a great game.Update Note: word of advice. Before doing any quest in this game just pay the 50 to 500 gold to rest at an Inn because that is the checkpoint the game will send you back to if you wish to reload from the last save.Storyline:What story? All the quests are stupid and boring, the main quest line isn't separated from the side quests, the romance is so half assed it might as well had not been done. I created a female character and I have been trying to romance Barnaby(a male pawn guild leader), then suddenly my character is acting like she's in love with the duke's wife(after only knowing her for a few seconds), who, for some reason is suddenly in love with her as well. This came totally out of left field. I have no issue with lesbian romances but I have been trying to romance Barnaby. Mind you the romances mean nothing, so don't expect Dragon Age here. You basically do an escort quest, give them some gifts they like and hear a chime to let you know they like you or something.Spoiler:Then I hear they get taken by the dragon. However, the romance system is so dumb to the point where the love interest can be any last npc who just so happens to have a high affinity score with you. I've even seen a post by one player claiming that his Arisen had a child as his love interest because of this and I believe had sex with it(as I think sex with the love interest is implied post game?? Not sure), which freaked him out.Anyway, as much as I don't like it, there are things I do like about it. I really like my pawn and wanted to romance him, there is a good potential for a story here in how the pawns are treated by the humans they are trying to save, you get your heart ripped out so are you dead, alive, are your emotions gone like a pawn?? Sadly I don't think any of this will be touched upon. Perhaps when the expansion come out I'll get it when the price drops as I hear traveling is easier but right now I will put it aside and find a new game. I just can't justify spending $40.00 bucks on an expansion just for unlimited ferry stones."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.001118951477110386, 0.008149167522788048, 0.06021890416741371, 0.03670345991849899, 0.05016665160655975, 0.06995295733213425, 0.009350021369755268, 0.0063626766204833984, 0.06083475798368454, 0.050889160484075546, 0.03473261743783951, 0.018862538039684296, 0.0026343471836298704, 0.008124751970171928, 0.017357833683490753, 0.0011979220435023308, 0.04575030133128166, 0.04584992304444313, 0.04669352248311043, 0.046544063836336136, 0.029256245121359825, 0.009157964959740639, 0.04493079334497452, 0.02642970345914364, 0.02572718821465969, 0.044266652315855026, 0.01084316149353981, 0.005509321577847004, 0.03821294382214546, 0.03810830041766167, 0.07862257957458496, 0.02744067832827568]]}
