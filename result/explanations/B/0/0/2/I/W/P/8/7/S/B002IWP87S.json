Remember, VGA is Analog where DVI is Digital", "Monitor cord, that does what it is suppose to do.  Nothing to fancy here, but it is a nice quality, and cleaner than using the adaptors.  Got here quickly, and", "Needed for connecting to a video card that only has DVI out.  Works well and at a very good price.  Would buy again if needed.", "Used this on a Dell computer. What can a say connected it and the video worked. Good product. I would recommend it.", "After purchasing this cable I bought another and this is why.  The DVI-i cable works as both analog and digital, while DVI-D does only digital and is harder to find.  DVI-a is anolog only.  I also bought a dvi-i to HDMI, but found that the picture is far crisper especially with web videos and programing with the DVI-I to VGA.  The only drawback using this cable is that sound is not carried as it is with HDMI.  So believe it or not the best picture and resolution is through this type of cable.  For cable hdtv, ps3, and computer blu ray movies the HDMI is better, but for computer web and misc working this cable is best.", "My video card has a VGA out and a DVI-I out. I've been only using the VGA output. Found an extra VGA monitor laying around and wanted a dual monitor set-up, so I needed a DVI-I to VGA. This worked perfectly. When it comes to computing, disregard people who make definitive statements like DON'T BUY THIS, or THIS DOES NOT WORK. If you know anything about computers, then you know there are so many variables as to why things don't work such as old hardware, firmware, drivers, etc. You need to trial and error yourself and don't take other people's word for it. Especially when you buy from Amazon, if it doesn't work out, you can return it.Just make sure you know the difference between DVI-I and DVI-D. This cable is for DVI-I. Do what I did, if you're not sure. Go to yahoo search engine and search DVI-I vs DVI-D. Then click on images. The very first image explains it all. Then go to you computer and take a look at your connection and see which one you have. This is probably one of the reasons why people say the cable doesn't work. They are buying the wrong cable!!", "Had a few older laptops that I needed to connect to our DVI monitors in the office and these have done the trick.  Great for the price.", "I need it the 24+1. Didn't know what I was doing. so it's my bad. I was going only by the pics not info. EVEN if I had read it, it would'nt have made sense anyway. Wanted to return it but the shipping cost as much as the cable itself. So I'm going to keep for a future computer that comes with the DVI 24+5. ;[", "They are of good quality.  All the pins seem to be in it.  I needed one with a shorter cord and this fit the bill.", "I bought this by mistake.  On the bright side, it does exactly what it's supposed to and I did find a use for it.  It was cheap too.Edit:I'd like to note that not all DVI outputs support this cable.  In general, if the long flat paddle looking pin is surrounded by four pins, it should work.  These are the pins that carry the analog signal.  If these four pins are missing, it won't work and you could cause damage trying to force the cable in.", "I bought 8 of these cables and they all came well packaged and on time (overnight shipping). As simple as they are, these cables are made well and the connectors are of good quality. We use them for dual monitor and I found no issue on the picture quality. This cable has ferrite beads (to reduce EMI) just like regular monitor cable, though it is not visible on this picture. I would not hesitate to buy this product again or recommend it to anyone.", "This is a high quality cable for those monitors that need such a converter. Some people didn't check their own PC or monitor to make sure that it is DVI-I, which is different than the other types of DVI.", "If you are setting up a second monitor, go with the proper cable.I'm not sure if it says, but this cable also has the ferrite bead on it, so youdon't have to worry about outside noise. (It's the same as the factory cable)I am running a ViewSonic P225 and a new Dell monitor (on top) through a GeForce 6200 and a windows xp3 op sys.The Dell hook up was clean with this cable and I did not have to mess around withDVI-I to VGA plugs or Gender interfaces.It makes the set up much cleaner.", "Can't see pins in photo. Won't fit a DVI-I monitor port. Useless trash. Do not buy this piece of junk.", "My PC monitor is VGA and when I got a Video Card for my computer, I thought it'd work. But apparently the graphics card only had DVI connectors on it. So I got this and it works great.The installation sucked because Dell make it nearly impossible to take out the old VGA cable from my monitor. I had to take off the base of the monitor to get to the slot.After I got it setup, I had no problems though :)", "\"Works just fine connected between my custom homebuilt computer, and a Hanns-G HG281D 28\"\" monitor.  No problems with ghosting or anything like that, image is crystal clear.  Nice price, don't pay $50+ for a junk Monster cable just to get the name.
