It feels very light and the shoulder strap is very comfortable.In the main compartment, I put my Canon 70D DSLR with 18-135 IS STM lens, this is tight fit but works. A large camera body + lens may have a hard time getting in without removing the neck strap.In the extra lens pocket I was able to put a Canon 70-300 IS II lens and a Canon 50mm prime lens stacked. The nice little touch about that pocket is it has an elastic band near the bottom. A nice feature is elastic band at bottom of lens case to hold it in tighter.There is also a spare pocket for small things like memory cards, battery, filters etc. It is more accessible than the side pocket, which is blocked by the tripod holder.There is a filter pocket. The two filter nets inside it hold 67mm filters fine, though the smaller one is better suited for a 58mm filter.The tripod holder is a very very nice feature. I have a full-size (62&#34;) tripod that I got on amazon and fits very nicely. There are two velcro strips to hold tripod in without the risk of losing it.The shoulder strap is very comfortable and well padded.The interior padding is decent. It's not super thick, but should be okay for minor impact.While the zippers secure the bags well, the main compartment has two zippers. ONE OF THEM BROKE WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF USING. I could deal with using one, but the SECOND ONE BROKE THE NEXT DAY. This is the only reason why I knocked it down to 4 stars. I returned mine to amazon and ordered another so hopefully that was just a bad case.Overall, it's a very well-designed bag for a small DSLR with 3 lenses (one small and 2 large). Importantly, it is in a compact design with good ergonomics and holds all the crucial items.Pros:- Holds many essential items for daily casual shooting- Well Built (minus zipper)- Well thought-out design- Very accessible pockets- Excellent valueCons:- ZIPPER QUALITY SHOULD BE UPGRADED (see above)", "Llego en el tiempo estipulado por el vendedor. Es hermoso, muy comodo y perfecto para llevar la camara y sus accesorios. Lo recomiendo 100%", "What an awesome bag for a dslr. I went on a three week trip to China with my wife and wanted to bring a good camera but did not want to carry my normal camera bag - it is such a pain. You can wear this one on the back, side or front (if you travel to unfamiliar places - do take car and wear the bag in the front, just a good advice). It has lots of pockets for accessories (like an extra lens) for you camera as well as other stuff you may be carrying. This bag stays close to your body, which makes it that much greater when you're in a place full of people (like subway in China... - again wear it in front of you unless you want to lose whatever you're carrying. This is not a warning for this bag - it's for any bag).If or when my bag falls apart, I will certainly buy this same bag (or whatever upgraded version of it they will have by that time).While it is not rated to be waterproof (or at least i didn't see it), i was caught in a bad rainstorm in Hong Kong for hours - i was concerned for my camera and tried to cover the bag best i could. When we got back to the hotel the bag was dry inside (that is part of the reason i'm so excited about this bag).", "Great for on the go. Took this on a recent trip to Australia and Singapore. Easily held my camera w/lens, as well as spare battery, extra SD cards and 2 additional lenses.", "It's a good bag and has lots of room, I can carry my Nikon D3100, SB-600 flash, extra lens filters, spare batteries & charger, lens cleaning kit, in a small package that doesn't necessarily &#34;look&#34; like a camera bag. But... The stitching pulled out on one of the straps, so I had to sew it up. Not a big deal, but inconvenient for a bag that wasn't the cheapest one available. Expected better life from the stitching.", "\"If you know going into this purchase that is sling is only good as a day pack then you'll enjoy this product. The reason I say this is becuase it is a little small the big enough for your SLR and an extra lens. There are a few little pockets that can be used to store a few small things like a claning cloth, maybe an extra battery, however you get the point. It's made well and seems like it will last a while. I am using a Canon T2i with a grip and it's a snug fit, it may fit better with out the grip I'll just have to wait and see. Most of the reviews I saw were reviews saying how small it is and it's not practicle...This is a great \"\"DAY PACK\"\" if your going somewhere for the day where you are not going to need all your gear grab this one and go. Good Luck.\"", "Excellent if you are looking for a bag for just one camera and a few extra things.", "PRO:+Made by Case Logic. I have owned several of their cases for different cameras and every one has been great.+Just what I need when I am going to use a 70-300mm zoom at grandkids softball and baseball games but I want to take along another lens so I can take group shots or landscapes or whatever else between games.+Great for trips where I want a couple of lenses or a lens and my rarely-used flash.CON:-Why would I ever want a strap around my waist that is two thirds belt and one-third an extension of hot, snug, padded case?? Even if it was comfortable (maybe it would be the day was very cold but NOT raining), it has to be worn very loose. Even loose, it still makes it hard to swing the case around to remove the camera and take a shot. I have rolled the strap up on itself and let it hang uselessly for now. I plan to just cut the thing off, because I love the case and it rides well on my back or my side as a shoulder bag (without a corset).CONCLUSION:Great case for the field or for travel. Be prepared to do some surgery on the useless, hindering belt. Sling the case over your shoulder and go out with your camera well protected and quickly at hand.", "I love this camera bag!  I use it with a Canon 60D and 18-200 lens (with petal hood) and the fit is perfect.  The pocket for an extra lens is not padded which would be a big complaint if I carried a lens in there.  I use a larger bag for multiple lens days and only occasionally have a lens in this pocket.  It holds a water bottle quite well!  Also, the tripod straps work great when you get warm and need a place to put your jacket.  All things considered, this is a great travel bag for anyone shooting with an SLR.", "I got this for my DSLR.  Love this case.  I can carry my camera and all my batteries and extra lens.  It can hold my tripod but have not used it that way yet.  ONLY issue is if you have a battery grip, it's a tight fit.  Not impossible but it is tight.", "Big enough for taking on a day trip or a long vacation. I like that it holds my camera with long lens safely in the sling. The extra lens pocket could be better padded...like other reviewers have mentioned. I took a padded divider from an old bag and wrap my lens with it for added protection . The sling is comfortable whether you use both straps or just one. This baby was selling for $79.99 plus tax at the Fry's electronics near our house where I checked it out. The amazon price is nearly half of what I would have paid. Two thumbs up on this one.", "For the price and what it provides, I would have no hesitation recommending this to anyone. Personally, I found shoulder bags only useful for hauling from X to Y and didn't like the idea of a backpack. This was the perfect alternative.It was a tight fit for my D90 + 28-70/2.8 + Battery grip, but it worked. Additionally, the side pocket can fit up to three lenses if you really want it. I would say 1 or 2 if they're larger, but if you have small prime lenses you can really fit quite a bit.Some of the other pockets are kind of pointless but probably useful if you want to have separate pockets for lens cleaners, etc. I particularly found the front pocket extremely useless since my body + lens + grip made it impossible to fit anything into it.The straps are really comfy but I didn't feel the need to use the secondary strap. I found it somewhat annoying that it wasn't removable but it was easy enough to tie or tuck away.It is probably okay if it is sprinkling but any substantial rain would probably soak into the bag eventually.Also, once you go to full frame + grip it doesn't fit. I had to sell mine.", "Great, well constructed bag for my Nikon D7000 with either the 18-200 or 35mm attached.  I can store either one I'm not using in the extra pocket with space to spare.  There are some miscellaneous pockets to stash other items.  Very comfortable, however, if you need to haul more than one extra lens, I'd look to one of Lowe Alpine's more technical packs.  Overall, very happy.", "\"I have an old LowePro AW-200 sling and was looking for something a little more compact for travel. This Case Logic sling seem to fit the bill for my newly downsized camera system built around an Olympus OM-D. This sling pack can comfortably fit my OM-D with the kit 12-50mm lens, medium sized flash, and Olympus 17mm f1.8 in a neoprene lens pouch in the main compartment, and the 40-150mm in a lens pouch inside the upper pocket. Batteries and memory cards fit in the bottom pocket, and filters and other bits fit in the front pocket under the tripod flaps. I probably won't be lugging a tripod along, so those flaps are superfluous at this point. The zippered pocket on the lower flap where the straps attach is good for filters and a microfiber lens wipe.I didn't use the camera hammock as I could fit more and access it more easily without the hammock in place. Without separate padded pockets for the lenses, I use neoprene pouches, although the ones I have were sized for APS-C sized lenses, and so they're rather too bulky. Smaller pouches would save space.The sling feels nicely built, and I had no trouble adjusting it to my short 5'4\"\" frame, despite what some commentors have said. It's very comfortable to wear. It's easy to slide it forward to access the camera compartment. BTW, some complained of a sticky zipper on the main compartment because of the right angle turn the zipper must make on the corner of the flap. I just lubricated the zipper with some wax and it works easily now.I can see where a sling bag that has adjustable silos for lenses and flash would be more convenient, especially when you are changing lenses often, like some of Case Logic's other slings. This one is good if you're packing light and it is certainly protective enough.Nice job, Case Logic.Update (April 2013) - After using it for a while, I find that I miss having \"\"silos\"\" for lenses. When changing lenses, I put the first lens in the main compartment while attaching the second lens. I don't like that there's nothing to hold the lenses upright during the changeover. Having some adjustable compartments to hold the lenses, like in some of Case Logic's other sling bags, would facilitate that process.One reason I changed from the LowePro sling was that the compartments for the lenses were horizontal when you slide the sling to your front. Hence, they weren't very accessible and if I opened the side flap fully, the lenses could slide out and fall to the ground. The LowePro could hold a lot, but operationally was difficult to use as a sling.So, I think this CL sling bag is great for walkaround use where you aren't going to be changing a lot of lenses on the fly. You can change lenses with a little juggling. It's very compact and comfortable. However, I might get one of their other slings, like the DCB-308 or CPL-109 that have dividers in the main compartment. Also, I think the sternum strap design works better than the waist strap on this one.\"", "\"Most of the positive reviews I agree with so I won't repeat them here.I will say this is a good case.  The padding for the camera is decent enough and it is comfortable enough to carry.  I took it on a 12 mile hike and it didn't cause me any problems so I consider that a success.I do have one warning though if you purchase this case.  The video and description about this case states that when you set the case down you do not have to worry about your lens hitting the ground.  The camera is held in place by an adjustable \"\"cradle\"\" and the lens is elevated above the bottom of the bag.  This does indeed work as advertised.However if you carry a SECOND lens in the side pouch as they say you can in the video, it WILL hit the ground and with very little padding. I've not broken any lenses yet but I keep thinking I will.  Good news is there is a good deal of space to add in my own padding so I think that will give me ease of mind going forward.So the warning is if you carry a second lens just be a little more careful.  The lens on the camera though is still well protected (even a 70-300mm Nikon lens is not too long for the cradle).Overall I really like this case.\"", "I just read a 2-star review written by someone who claims this sling isn't for a woman.  Well, it is for THIS woman!  I tried every sling out there and this was the only one that crossed in the right places up front.  I don't use the waist strap, just to speed up swinging it around and getting the camera out.  And that process, by the way, is fast.  I photograph animals, mainly, some wild, some wild-n-crazy domestic, so time is of the essence.  This sling has become one piece of equipment I just couldn't do without.  I actually store my camera and most frequently used lenses in it all the time, so that I can just grab it and go.At first I was worried about whether my Sony A580 and its 70-300G lens would fit.  That was kind of important, and according to the measurements given, it looked doubtful.  The lens is pretty big, and the camera is large for a mid-grade DSLR.  Well, the combo does fit, even with the lens attached.  Or, I can put the lens by itself in the side pocket, which is very tall and has an elastic strap for a little more security when you open it.  Another tall pocket on the opposite side of the case is good to stuff the waist strap into if you don't use it.There is also a small pocket that would be great for filters.  I use it for two extra batteries.  There's a big flat pocket in front, under the tripod flap.I do have a good sized Ape case for the rest of my gear, but never take that out.  I decide which lenses I'll need ahead of time, and since the sling can hold one large and two small along with the camera, that's what goes with me.  This thing is so perfect for me that I've thought about buying another one in case they stop making them.", "I have owned this bag for roughly five months, and I can say that it has seen it's fair share of use.  I purchased it  as an alternative to myLowepro 35091 Primus AW Premium Backpack (Black).  While the Primus has also been good when I have had a need to lug all my gear around, sometimes that much equipment isn't needed, especially for leisurely shooting.  Because of that, I'd often find myself not taking my camera with me at all.The SLRC-205 helps by providing just enough space for the essentials.  The large camera pocket can fit a decent zoom lens on a smaller body, with a prime or smaller zoom sitting under the hammock. One other large piece of gear in the second largest pocket above (another lens, an external flash, battery grip, tabletop tripod, etc.).  Depending on the size of the the last piece of gear, a few other pieces can be crammed into that space, such as a battery charger.  I have been able to fit a flash and a battery grip in there, but there isn't room for much else.  There are three other pockets, two which sit fairly flush and are pretty much good for only flat items like release cords, cables, cards, and microfiber cloths. The last pocket along the base of the strap can fit random parts (hot shoe cover, flat lens cap, compact USB card reader).The SLRC-205 is also convenient because it doesn't need to be taken off like a backpack. Although I can access my camera from the side access zipper, I need to take it off to grab a lens or get a new filter.  With the SLRC-205, it can be swung up front, and all the pockets can be accessed.  It's great for sitting down without needing to take anything off.My only qualms with this case are as follows:1. One of the corners of the camera pocket doesn't (un)zip very easily.  It could be because I'm placing a lens under the hammock, and the camera doesn't sag down into it completely.2. The hammock itself is a nice idea, but I find it a bit troublesome.  While a lens with a reversed hood can fit through the hammock quite easily, the petal-type hoods frequently get caught when trying to pull the camera out.  It's not a major snag, but it's enough to cause worry, especially if the camera is placed in and pulled out of the hammock often.3. A camera with a battery grip may not fit in the camera pocket and lens through the hammock, at the very least mine will not (Nikon D7000 with MB-D11).  Perhaps by not using the hammock and removing the lens could the camera fit, but then it may be more of a hassle than just not using the battery grip.4. While extremely comfortable in normal clothing, I find that the strap presses against my neck quite a bit while wearing a motorcycle jacket.  Although, I've never had a problem with the bag shifting around, even when I don't use the second strap to secure it.  Plus it's easier to get a sling on with motorcycle gear on than a backpack.5. Maybe it's just the way I'm wearing it, but it's harder to move with a decently sized tripod on the back.  The tripod hangs at maybe a 45 angle; I find my tripod banging up against doors, cabinets, and anything else on my way out.  While my tripod is fairly sturdy, I can't say the same about the things I'm running into.  My Lowepro backpack does a better job of holding a tripod, as it does it vertically.  I'm less worried about hitting things above my head than my side.6. I can't comment on how well the padding in the camera pocket is, but there is none whatsoever in any of the other pockets.  The larger pocket can hold another lens, but protection is nil.Rather than taking off the battery grip and putting into the large pocket (thereby losing space), I've opted to use a sling style camera strap as well.  The loops on the SLRC-205 are rather nice for looping the sling through; I really only have to worry about one strap.  Since the camera is no longer in the bag, I can put more equipment in the hammock area.  The downside to this is that I can't hop onto my motorcycle and ride around town (not that I couldn't but I'd much prefer it if my camera didn't smack against the side of my bike every second). Also, with the sling strap, I can't keep my tripod on my bag, or it'll hit that as well.Overall, the SLRC-205 is a fine bag, and while it's not as useful for larger cameras and equipment-intensive setups, it's great for those who only need a few items (most people). I'd say it's suited to be a vacationing bag, since it can fit under your seat on an airplane, it's good for hopping on and off buses, and you really only need a few basic things to take photos your family and friends will enjoy.", "Extremely light-weight and well-constructed. However only allows wearing on left side. Yes, I ordered seeing the pics, but so liked the design, thought I'd give it a try. Tried to make it work, but wearing it the way I need on the opposite side made camera access tricky. Kind of like requiring a left-handed person to use the opposite hand. Otherwise a great design and good quality bag. Regretfully returned.", "I needed a bag for my NEX-5.  I'm mainly use my 18-200 lens on my NEX-5. The camera body, being so small required that I needed a pad on the lower end below the lens for proper support.  A block of foam covered with a microfiber cloth did the job.  The camera, lens, and hood can be fully assembled and ready to use at any moment. I also keep my 18-55 lens, a small can of air and spare microfiber cloths in the upper compartment.  My tripod or monopod can easily strapped to the outside.  There is also plenty of room for the NEX-7 camera body when it is released by Sony.11/11/11 : UPDATE I downgraded my review after purchasing the Lowepro 100.  This Case Logic sling has so much wasted space.  I now consider this sling bag as adequate. You don't know what you are missing until until you've traded up.", "I agree with the other reviews, Case Logic has really put some thought into designing this case. Every aspect of the design reflects their efforts and I thank them for that. The suspension system for the camera is awesome. I can pretty much throw my bag around without worrying about the camera getting damaged because it is so well protected. 2 small pockets for charging cable and other miscellaneous stuff are included which I use for memory cards and remote. I don't use the tripod much but I can see it fitting well in the back straps.That said, here are a few of my observations that I would like to see addressed in future versions:1. Size - the bag is oversized for what it accommodates. It seems there is a lot of empty space between the pockets that could have been eliminated, which would make this a perfectly sized bag. The current design is basically a backpack. Given that it only accommodates a camera, I'm sure a smaller design would be more efficient to carry.2. Lens pocket - the lens pocket is nicely secured with ample padding. However, adding adjustable separators for each lens would have been great. I use two spare lenses and they currently just float around banging against each other in the pocket.3. Shoulder strap - The shoulder strap is also nicely padded, but since it is really meant to be carried cross-shoulder, the edge of the strap constantly rubs against the side of my neck. I mostly have to carry it on one shoulder, which is not always convenient.All in all, this is definitely one of the better bags I have tried and the price is reasonable too. Until they come out with an improved design (hopefully soon), I am happy with this product.", "This slingbag provides everything you need if you're constantly on-the-go or hiking trails. While the space is limited, it provides protection and rapid access to the camera for those quick shots you don't want to miss. I've used the bag at parties, events, and while hiking craters in Hawaii. With enough space to hold my Nikon D3200 and a few items, I fell in love with the design and utility. Here's the Pro/Con list to help you decide if this bag is for you.PROS:-Sling bag w/ adjustable straps, shoulder & waistThis is a sling bag with adjustable straps, it has the standard sling (over your shoulder, non-reversible, left shoulder only) with a solid amount of padding which makes it comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and it also has a waist sling if you want to hang on to it even tighter. They both have buckles to quickly strap on/off the bag if you don't' want to fling it over your shoulder, and they are adjustable to fit your size.-Handle on the topThe handle on the top makes it easy to handle the bag for short distances without having to sling or buckle the whole bag while shuffling around. NOTE: The handle is on the top flap where you put the camera in so the zipper HAS to be closed. It also makes it easy to grab the bag around your waist and pull the camera out rapidly while moving.-Padding & ProtectionThe padding is enough to withstand basic bumps and short falls - like from a chair or short height. I haven't tested anything higher, nor do I plan to (on purpose). The camera itself sits like a holster inside the bag with the lens dropping in which makes it incredibly easy to pull in and out, and it also acts as a secondary shock absorbent for small falls. I feel secure with the protection this provides.-Slick, modern designThe design of the bag (the sling effect) looks modern and almost looks like a regular sling bag that you would use day-to-day. Most people won't care about this, but it's a personal touch that influenced my decision in the end.CONS:-Body and environmental heatThe bag is designed to breath and keep the equipment cool, but if you're wearing this bag and you produce any body heat it will trap in the exterior of the bag and make you sweat. This is heavily dependent on the environment you are in. 75-80 degree California weather and the sweat was minimal, 80-90 degree Hawaii weather and it felt like wearing a hot pocket.-No &#34;bottom&#34;Most camera bags have a flat surface to rest the bag, but this is a padded and protected slingbag which will just flop/fall wherever you place it. If you need to place the camera in the holster while you're wearing it, you'll have no problems. If you're putting the camera away while the bag is on a desk you'll have to hold it. This isn't really a con for me, but some people prefer having that solid footing. Either way, not a big deal.NOTES:-Storage & PocketsThe main pocket/holster has enough space for the camera and a standard lens in the holster (Nikon D3200 + 55mm lens with an inch or two of extra space below).There is a secondary pocket for an additional lens (dimensions: 8.5&#34; x 4&#34; x 5&#34;), which can also double as a pocket for a water bottle if you're hiking.Another pocket is in the front (behind the Velcro) which fits a standard battery charger, extra battery, or cell phone. Not all at the same time, the space is snug and limited.On the opposite end there is a small pocket with enough room for a few memory cards (with little holders), and extra batteries. You can probably fit the memory cards + 2 batteries if needed.The last pocket is on the shoulder strap itself, it's tiny and enough to fit a pack of gum or the lens cap.If you're carrying a tripod the Velcro on the front will hold it well enough, as long as you're not doing any parkour.There's also space to attach a carabiner to the front of the sling if you have accessories to attach (hand sanitizer, phone clip, or you can run the camera strap through it if you're paranoid and don't want to sling it over your neck every time you pull the camera out.All in all, the bag has everything you need if you want to be portable, but the limited space will turn a few people off.", "You can tell this bag was not designed well. Some of the storage compartments are awkward to get to. Its ok for the price. Im keeping it.", "Thought this would help in carrying 2 lens with me but I was wrong.  I have 2 L's 100mm and 35mm  neither fit the side pockets.  Oh well garage sale coming soon so there it goes...", "It appears to work well once you get used to odd feeling of the straps.  It holds my Olympus E620 with lense and my 70-300 mmlense in the large extra pocket, along with the battery charger and cable.  Another pocket holds the computer cable and sparememory cards and another smaller pocket hold the spare batteries.", "Used for my Canon DSLR. Just perfect fit and easy to carry. Has extra pockets for 1 or 2 lenses, strap to carry a tripod or other item, and small pockets for memory cards/keys/etc. Very comfortable to wear around your shoulder all day. Highly recommended!", "\"I'm really happy with this camera bag. The main sling compartment is plenty big to hold my camera body even with a 70-300mm lense and hood (installed backward) installed, and the main side pocket is plenty big to hold all but very long lenses. I really appreciate the straps on the front to hold your tripod, and the whole sling concept is excellent in the way that you can slide it around to work with your gear at your front, then slide it all to your back again and out of the way. My only minor beef is that it's a little tedious to access the small front compartment as it's underneath the tripod holder flaps, but I'm just nit-picking with that one. One comment about fit; I'm 6'1\"\" and it's comfortable for me but it's way too big an uncomfortable for my 5' tall wife so if you're petite you may want to look elsewhere.\"", "This is a sturdy bag with good-quality construction that doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart on me any time soon. I love the design of this bag-- the sling design allows for super quick access to my camera and the &#34;cradle&#34; on the inside seems to cushion my camera really well inside the pack. I get a lot of use out of this bag and expect that I will for many years.", "Wore this for a relatively short walk... Just 4 miles on relatively easy terrain. Had a sore back for days afterward. Horrible bag. Too lazy to return it, so I gave it away. Still feeling guilty for giving it to a family member. Probably going to get coal for Christmas from that family member. And I probably deserve it. This is a nasty little bag.", "\"I just bought my first Digital Camera and specifically bought this bag for a Colorado Trip we have planned for later this year. The bag is well made and the orange and yellow stripping does dress up the bag. The bag itself has lots of little pockets for additional camera items, cell phone, keys etc. I have plenty of room for the camera and two lenses. I love the little velcro tabs that wrap up the loose straps. For me as a woman 5'5\"\" to have the pack up against your back the strap goes right across your chest. If you loosen it up the bag hangs lower on your back and kind of flops out and does not lay against your back. Either way it still works when you swing it around the front to access the camera. Can't wait to use it once the weather breaks.\"", "I do love this camera case , its very practical, lots of pockets , I just came short for me when I decided to start carrying other lenses!! :) extra lenses means extra room! this one fits perfectly . and the feel its great!!! wont hurt your shoulder!!", "\"I decided to try this Case Logic sling for my Rebel T4i because I wanted a bag that could also hold an extra lens or two, a monopod, spare batteries and memory cards, lens pen, and other odds and ends. I also wanted something rugged that I would feed comfortable toting around if I'm out riding my bike, hiking, or even just at the zoo.This bag meets all these expectations. I really like how the sling can be secured around your waste, too, for extra security--and with the flick of a clip, you can quickly rotate the bag around to your front to access your camera. I also like all the assorted smaller pockets; it makes life so much easier when everything has a defined home, instead of just having it all float around in one giant pocket. I find Case Logic's unique hammock system for securing my camera and attached lens an added advantage of this sling.I do rather wish the top lens/accessory pocket was a bit larger, and perhaps came with removable/movable partitions, but that's not a deal breaker. I also think it would be great if the bag included side a pocket for carrying a bottle of water, and a pocket on the strap for my cell phone. Many of Case Logic's other slings and backpacks include a water-proof self-cover, and it's a little disappointing that this doesn't also have one. Finally, it would be amazing if there was a thin padded pocket at the back where you could slip in a tablet or thin laptop like my 11\"\" MacBook Air or another ultra book. (In retrospect, I guess I should have tried theCase Logic DCB-308 SLR Camera Sling (Black); it has more versatility for storing extra lenses and such, can accommodate a tablet or thin netbook/laptop, and includes the water-proof self-cover--but it doesn't use the Case Logic's hammock system, which I really wanted.)Wishful thinking aside, I'm actually very pleased with this bag. I may eventually outgrow it (or rather, my gear may eventually outgrow it), but for the quick trip where I'm out and about, either on my bike or on my feet, this is pretty much perfect.\""], "Gamma":
