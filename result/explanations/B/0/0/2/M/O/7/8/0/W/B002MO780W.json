"], "reviews": ["\"My granddaughter just turned seven and is enjoying growing up. She likes to use her Mom's and my stuff, and while still a \"\"little\"\" girl, enjoys the feminine side of things.Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath. Looking at the words, she decided that \"\"Just for Me,\"\" referred to her, and insisted that her mom use it on her hair. I'm not certain which age group they are after with that title, but I think they hit the market with that one.The shampoo isn't very thick and it lathered into her hair easily. The conditioner also went in nicely and didn't leave her hair greasy at all. Together they made a nice set. Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her personality.Both the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)\"", "This is a very nice shampoo that leaves hair soft and clean.  I have purchased shampoos in the past that I have paid a great deal more for, and really can't tell the difference. The scent is pleasant, not too strong like some products.", "\"Got this shampoo because my hair is growing out finer and finer as I get older. I find that more common store brands seem too harsh, too sudsy, and harder to rinse now. I've been using this for one week now, and I just love it. The moment I popped the cap, the smell engulfed me. It smelled so wonderful, good enough to eat! I squeezed the same amount I usually use with other shampoos, which is to say about a quarter-sized circle. When I put it on my hair, I realized I needed more. This shampoo is so gentle that if you want the same amount of sudsiness as a regular shampoo, you have to use more.  But then that defeats the purpose of using a mild shampoo. If you shampoo your hair everyday because you're like me who can't go to anywhere without making sure she's clean from head to toe, and your hair is fine or thinning out, this would be a great shampoo for you. Because this shampoo is so mild, it rinses off in a snap. I follow it up with its matching conditioner, Just for Me Hair Milk Conditioner, and again the smell is so gorgeous!The only cons I can think of (and that's why I rated it 4 stars) is that at the end of the day, your hair can feel a little sticky even if you hadn't done anything and just stayed in the office the whole day. I made the mistake of driving with the top down in my car one afternoon (after shampooing with this product in the morning), and my hair was so tangled and sticky afterwards, more than the usual when I use store brand shampoo and conditioner. I had to shampoo with this twice that night to get all the \"\"dirt\"\" and stickiness out, as the first time the shampoo didn't become foamy or sudsy at all. Also, even if you hadn't done anything, by the end of the day, the wonderful smell deteriorates to a soapy kind of smell, sort of like a hand soap. I thought I was imagining it until I pulled my hair to my nose the end of the first day I used it, and the smell has become the soapy kind of smell. Otherwise, I just love this product!\"", "Once I could get past the strong scent, much like suntan lotion, the Just for me Hair milk wasn't bad. I have thin, dry, frizzy, flyaway hair. The lather wasn't strong but it got it clean, and my hair does feel soft and smooth. I just smell like a day at the beach, even now, 1/2 hour after showering. I found Just for me rinsed fine and didn't leave a residue.", "\"The creamy white bottle is fitting for a shampoo that calls itself \"\"hair milk,\"\" and the creamy white texture of the liquid inside fits, too. The graphic design on the bottle might make you wonder if it's a product for kids, but nevertheless it does the job whatever your age. (But who is the \"\"me\"\" on the label, from a marketing perspective? Dunno -- maybe just me!)At any rate, I found the texture to be nice, much like other shampoos I've used. And I liked the smell. It almost seemed coconut-y. The shampoo left my long hair easy to comb, and that's the bigger plus for me. I also appreciate the healthy ingredients like biotin, honey, vitamin E and C, and shea butter.\"", "This is a really nice shampoo.  I have to admit, I never heard of it before so I was a little unsure.This makes your hair really soft, and managable.  I have long, thick and wavy hair and it even made my mane manageable.  I had to use conditioner after to get the comb through but the shampoo made my hair extra soft.It has a very pleasant, soft scent too.  It lathers up nicely and rinses clean.I don't use any product in my hair or curl it or whatever but if you style your hair, I think this shampoo may make your hair too soft for styling. I put my hair in a pony tail and there were pieces sliding out but that's ok for me.all in all, a great shampoo.", "This shampoo makes hair feel silky when it first goes on and de-oiled after the rinse. That's because of the ingredients. I think this shampoo compares favorably with Fekkai and even ALTERNA shampoos.This shampoo has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Cocamidopropyl Betaine, the key ingredients!Sodium Lauryl Sulfate comes from coconut and palm oils. It's used for all kinds of detergents to remove oily residues. This really gets into the hair and takes away all the oily residues.Cocamidopropyl Betaine comes from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine. It's a surfactant. That means it lowers the surface tension of a liquid like a foaming agent - perfect in a detergent.I recommend using this shampoo with a good conditioner as it strips out oily residue pretty efficiently.", "\"I find this a confusing product to review. On the one hand, it does a decent job as a shampoo and the fragrance is milder than in many products, which is important to me as a person who sometimes gets a headache or other symptoms from perfume. On the other hand, some of the ingredients are not totally gentle.The name of the product might fool people who are unfamiliar with the term \"\"Hair Milk.\"\" It does not mean that there is any dairy product in the shampoo. There is soy milk in this, however, so if someone in your family is allergic to soy, be forewarned.The front label may lead the consumer to think this a natural product. Shea butter, soymilk and honey sound wholesome and natural. However, the long list of ingredients on the back of the bottle tells a different story. Yes, there are botanicals in the shampoo. However, there are also a number of chemicals and fragrance components, some of which can be allergenic or irritating. Propylene glycol, DMDM Hydratoin, and limonene can be irritants, for instance.  Also, benzyl salicylate (which is spelled incorrectly on the Amazon description but which I compared to the label on the product) may be an endocrine disrupter or environmental toxin, according to EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database.I'm giving the shampoo four stars anyway, because it is just about impossible to find a truly safe shampoo that does a good job. At least this one does not make my scalp itch or burn (and some of the all-natural ones do!), and the scent is not problematic for me. Your mileage may vary.\"", "This is one really nicely scented shampoo that reminds me of fresh cocoanut on a sunny day. A small amount well distributed through damp hair results in a pleasant thick lather. A rinse with lukewarm water results in silky smooth hait that is vibrant and shiny without being greasy. My hair felt so good that I bypassed conditioner. For a vibrant head of hair devoid of tangles, I recommend this product.", "Nothing special about this shampoo. The scent is not particularly pleasant but the only good part about the scent is that it is not very strong. My hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth. The same is true of my scalp which had some itch pre-shampoo and kept the same itch post-shampoo. This is not the kind of shampoo I would purchase or even use again. It is just blah.", "I have long, straight, dry, 56-year-old  hair. As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I have been trying a lot of good quality shampoos of various kinds. Most are over-priced and don't give me any significant  results. However this shampoo gave me great results. After using this shampoo, my hair was shinier and more manageable. My one complaint is that I usually shampoo my hair every 4-5 days. This shampoo added so much moisturizer that I had to shampoo after 2 days or my hair felt oily. So this is for those who shampoo every day or two.", "I found Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle intriguing at best. The title regarding Hair Milk Shampoo, and the perfectly pearly milky contents, is just sounded out of the norm in terms of presentation. The shampoo works well. Leaves the hair feeling gratifyingly clean, very smooth and silky, and the not overwhelming fragrance smells nice. The price of $5 something, seemed more than fair.Kind of an interesting side note, I noticed that in the product description all that was listed was the many, many ingredients,  There is a safety note that warns is not a toy, not to swallow any shampoo, and be careful to keep away from mouth and eyes. I noticed immediately that in most other shampoos these warnings do not appear (Aveeno, Tresemme, etc.), but yet in this one is almost like a warning meant for a child, and would it all have something to do with milk? What responsible adult would take a drink is beyond me, unless they thought they were drinking some eggnog or any milk based refreshment? Go figure. Amazon, like always, a class act.The shampoo itself leaves the hair clean, I wouldn't say baby clean at this stage, but soft, smooth and silky. Will it become the number one in our household with the fierce competition that abounds? That question, unfortunately, can not be answered in such a short notice. For the time being I give this milk shampoo 4 White Stars!", "The moisture milk shampoo is a greatshampoo if you need a moisturizer for your hair.  The fragrance is light and appealing. The big downside is that it does not provide much lather so its cleaning is gentle at best.  It works great as a maintenance shampoo after you have properly washed your hair.", "gave this to the wife and daughter to use.  they said it lathered up nice.  it cleaned well and it did leave their hair soft and shiny.  they did like the product for they said it was gentler on their hair.", "\"I have a very sensitive scalp and a years-long history of problems with shampoo, so it is an unusual thing that I can find a shampoo that I can use at all.Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottleis one of the very few I've found that doesn't cause a severe reaction and leave me clawing at my head.While I do not particularly like the scent and this particular shampoo does not leave my hair \"\"squeeky\"\" clean - just clean - it also doesn't dry out my scalp and I found that I could easily brush out my hair (long enough to sit on) without recourse to any form of conditioner.Grandma's $0.02 - Not my fave, don't like the smell but this shampoo is mild and does not cause me any reaction, so it is worth the trade off.Recommended\"", "I like the Just for Me Hair Milk products. The shampoo is rich and lovely. It smells really good and my son is willing to use it. He needs moisture or his hair becomes a bristly bushy mess.The shampoo lathers up great and rinses out easily. It leaves the hair feeling nicely conditioned. In fact, it leaves the hair better conditioned than the conditioner does. I recommend this shampoo but the follow up product is very skippable.", "A different shampoo than I have ever used before. Very silky and creamy feeling. The one thing I did not like was it does not lather up very well. But still a good product.Great product for the money! Would buy again!", "\"leaves hair feeling very soft, I find I have to wash my hair a little more often, leaves my hair feeling \"\"heavy\"\" requires more rinsing\"", "\"I am a Caucasian male who is rapidly approaching fifty.  For most of my life I suffered from dandruff until I learned that I had to use a daily 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  In the past, I have used Pantene Pro-V 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Flat to Volume [Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo & Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)]; Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh (Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner (Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in1 Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce).  All of these products have worked wonderfully.  However, I don't like to use a hygiene product for an extended period of time because my body develops a resistance.  It is like taking an antibiotic for too long; soon, the antibiotic won't work.  My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  I believe this also applies to hygiene products.Just For Me doesn't have a 2 in 1 hair conditioner and shampoo.  It probably should; it makes using shampoo and conditioner so much simpler.  In order to prevent dandruff, I must use shampoo and conditioner every day.  I received from the Amazon Vine Program both the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner (Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle).  There exists some controversy as to the targeted users for these products.  Many say they are intended for African American children.  I have used them faithfully for over a week and haven't had any problems.  I simply squirt dabs of shampoo and conditioner into my palm and mix them together.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly and have a milky, white appearance.  I rub the mixture into my hair and let it remain until after I finish lathering the rest of my body with soap.  I must admit that the mixture of shampoo and conditioner does not lather well.  This is fine with me.  I prefer to use the two products simultaneously in order to keep me from having to remember whether or not I used the conditioner.  When they are in separate bottles, I sometimes forget to use the conditioner.  I work two jobs and can't afford to dawdle in the shower.I didn't have any trouble rinsing the shampoo and conditioner concoction out of my hair.  It left my hair slightly fragrant.  Afterwards, I rubbed a little bit of Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel (Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel, 16.9 Ounce) in my hair and blow dried it.  My hair looked voluminous and shiny and it remained that way throughout the day.  Also, I didn't have any annoying itch as though I needed to wash my hair or didn't thoroughly wash it enough the first time.  When the bottles of Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner have been emptied, I will probably cycle through the other products I have mentioned earlier.  In this manner, my hair never becomes resistant to one product.  It is nice to know that I can use the Just For Me Hair Milk product line in order to control my dandruff.  My Hispanic dad, who is fast approaching eighty, is visiting me for the 4th of July holiday and I convinced him to try the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner.  He is using the two products simultaneously just like me.  Yesterday, he said, \"\"Give them a five star rating.\"\"Joseph B. Hoyos\"", "I have used the Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo and love the smell. The Shampoo has a bit of a detangler to it, so my hair does not tangle, even if I skimp on the conditioner. In order to keep curls from being frizzy, I need to use some product, so my hair is often dry. Also, I have very fine hair, in spite of the curls, so my hair frizzes much easier than someone with thicker locks. It is terrible in the summer. Regardless, I need something with a high amount of moisturizer or my hair is just disgusting.  The shampoo is a good start, but I didn't like the matching conditioner as much.", "\"If you want your hair \"\"squeaky clean\"\" then this is probably not the shampoo for you. I like my hair clean, no longer oily at the roots, but not dried out at the ends, and I feel most of the \"\"squeaky clean\"\" varieties of shampoo are too harsh and drying. I don't have curly or highly textured hair, which I believe is the target market for this whole line of products, and that's why I haven't tried the conditioner or anything else, only the shampoo, and I like it well enough on my fine, basically straight, irish-red hair. It does a perfectly good job and seems gentle, although really I'm not that picky about my shampoo.\"", "\"I often skip a day between shampoos, and most of the shampoos I use allow me to do that without my hair feeling kind of dirty on the second day.  This one doesn't work for me because  I didn't like the feel even immediately after shampooing and rinsing thoroughly; my hair didn't have that squeaky-clean feeling I like. Okay, maybe it will work - I'll give it a try.  Nope, on the second day, my hair felt dirty to me.  Not obviously \"\"this woman hasn't washed her hair in 3 weeks\"\" dirty, but a heavy, somewhat oily feel I don't like.So I tried to find more information about the product.  Apparently, this product line is geared towards children, and more towards children with \"\"ethnic\"\" hair.  If that information had been available on the Amazon page, I would not have requested this product, but it wasn't, and it just doesn't work for my fine-textured, old-white-lady hair.I do love the light, very pleasant scent of it though.\"", "This did a good job the little ones are washing and conditioner allot since they are in and out of the pool, and playing outside... its been used often. It's effective we will be using it in the future we also have the conditioner, detangler, and hair moisturizer they compliment each other well. Great products. This Shampoo lathers well and smells pleasnt and it leaves my daughter hair hydrated, soft and smooth.Even my son who has fairly short mostly straight hair uses some of the products. They leave my daughters hair with such full, shiny, beautiful fresh curls we love these products.", "Although it is my understanding that this shampoo is geared towards younger people of ethnic descent, I'm loving it.  My hair is long, and wavy, naturally Caucasian blonde and white, with very dry ends.  Normally the sheer weight of my hair pulls a lot of the wave out.This shampoo smells like coconut, but not an entirely natural coconut- it smells a bit more like an 80's tanning oil might.  The lather is rich if not luxurious.  The scent left on my hair is very subtle, but fresh.  When used with the conditioner, my hair is allowed to air dry, I have these BEAUTIFUL waves that I don't even have to style my hair to get.The scent lasts about a day, and the waves don't fall flat even in humidity, I suppose the oils help hold moisture into the hair to prevent that.  My ends look better than they've looked with much more expensive shampoos.It does not make my hair look oily in the least.  I'll definitely buy this again.", "I have sometimes difficult hair, and it's often a challenge to find products that are agreeable with it.  My hair is very fine, and it can get oily quickly, and it's also colored.  So I have to find something not too drying, not too moisturizing, and something that doesn't weigh my hair down.  I was actually surprised how nice this shampoo was!It worked really well for me.  My hair felt clean and light, and it had noticeably more volume, which I found quite impressive!  It didn't dry out my hair (I tested it alone, without any conditioner) but it somehow moisturized my hair more than most shampoos I've tried!This is a really great shampoo.  It lathers really well, it has a nice, clean scent, and it left my hair feeling silky soft and clean.  I was surprised how inexpensive it was, too!  I will definitely purchase it in the future.The only thing though - do NOT purchase the conditioner of this brand.  It's absolutely awful!  I will be using the shampoo alone, or with another brand of conditioner.  The conditioner was watery and gross, and yet it left my hair feeling gunky like I hadn't showered in a couple days!  It was far and above the worst conditioner I've ever used.  So odd though, considering great the shampoo is!", "These products are flat out great, whether for hair conditioning, cleaning or detangling. My child has a wild head of curly hair and this is the first product she's ever been able to apply herself so that she can comb her own hair out after her shower.", "Great shampoo if your hair is fine like mine and you're looking for control without too much added weight.  Lathers nicely and leaves hair manageable without being so oily it looks awful shortly thereafter.My ultimate test?  My convertible.  Driving in it will normally leave my hair looking like it went through a blender but a couple quick hand swipes and it was back to normal -- most other shampoos won't give me that level of control.About the only gripe I have is the bottle design.  Typical push down top but this one is a little too small and it takes a bit of effort to get enough shampoo out; however, if that's the worst I have to worry about I'll be happy.", "Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo has a pleasant, fruity, tropical scent. It is more of a conditioning shampoo than one that rinses easily but it does leave the hair quite soft and most certainly not stripped and dry.The Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.", "I only had the shampoo, so I don't know if there is a hair miracle to using this along with conditioner and the other products, but the shampoo alone is nothing special. It comes in a bottle that looks like a milk bottle, and that's it. Doesn't smell fancy. Doesn't make any noticeable difference to my hair, not like Senscience which is the only shampoo that does seem to make a noticeable difference.", "This product is mild and effective. It does not have the chemical chase which most shampoos carry. The container and dispensing is hand friendly. There are so many of these products on the market today. It requires a brain to select one. This one is very simple on the label with shea butter, soymilk and honey standing out and it actually feels that way in usage.", "Good, thick shampoo with very light scent. I have thin and fine hair and like how it worked.  I only needed to wash it once (no repeat!).", "I have never been a huge fan of the Just for Me hair line but I noticed that over the years I have taken a liking to a few of their newer and improved products.
