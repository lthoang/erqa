But should this product be on the VMware HCL?Well, as a VMware engineer, I was eager to try this product out for two reasons.  I needed a repository for large files and I wanted to see if this could pass the muster in terms of \"\"minimal\"\" performance.  By this, I mean two or three VMs running on the Raid1 setup (default).  And although I didn't expect to run performance tests on this, I did expect to run my WSUS server on it (for a total of 10VMs) and my EDGE server on it....no performance mind you, just a place for large or non performing VMs, respectively, that could live on \"\"less than adequate performing storage\"\" (no insult intended).Well, the Storage vmotion to it went fine.  My login times using RDP have quadrupled!  BLAH!  I get errors loading MMCs within WSUS because of the Storage iOPS delay time outs.In summary, at BEST, this is a good ISO/Template repository.  I am disappointed this is on the VMware HCL because I expected to run at least 2 non-taxing VMs with reasonable performance ( I moved them from old Ultra3 scsi attached storage).  The performance is terrible....working, but terrible.If you need basic storage for your environment and do not want to run any VMs (like the ISOs/Templates example), then this device will satisfy.  But if you expect minimal performance to run a couple of VMs, then you'll be disappointed.I will be adding other storage and turning this device into my ISO's/templates LUN.  Hope this helps anyone trying to decipher the performance/price/supported decision making process.UPDATE:After experiencing some horrible performance problems, I diagnosed that my issues were NOT with the IOMEGA drive.  My 24port gig switch started throwing all sorts of TX and RX errors and of course that would impact iSCSI performance :>).  At this time I would change my review to 4 STARS although would caution putting more than 3 running VMs on each ix-200 device.\"", "I have a Windows Home Server as well as this StorCenter. I have to say, that while the StorCenter was pretty easy to set up and works well, it can't compete with the WHS device. The only exception is iSCSI -- its nice that the StorCenter appears as an iSCSI target.", "Update!! This thing should have zero stars. I set it to copy some files from my hard drive and the thing was filling my computers hard drive with the copy instead of copying it to the drive within this storcenter. This is unacceptable, I would not recommend this at all and I have disconnected the drive and removed all the software from it just so I can have my 500 GB hard drive back and not filled up with useless copies of itself.Update- this thing is goofy, it doesn't shut down at all, it is accessing the disk and doing something at all hours of the day and night. (it is set to backup at 11 PM) I checked into what it is doing and I can't find what it is doing when I hear the disk activity. The log file has dates for 2036? and for 2010. I don't understand how it got changed to the future? I may have to call tech support on this when I get the time, it i acting as though it has a mind of its own... LOLThis Storcenter is very easy to setup and I had it going within minutes, the interface is easy to deal with and get your backup going. I didn't test the restore feature. I did not find this too noisy and I have it sitting right above my desktop computer.pros--easy setup, (I am not experienced in this kind of thing)-intuitive GUI-has a power saver feature to shut down the drives after idle for a user determined amount of time (the default is 1 hr)-I can do a copy to copy certain files to the backup-it can do incremental backups which is a time savercons--it would have taken days to backup my entire computer (it apparently wanted to backup even the empty space?)-even with selecting only certain folders it still took several hours and I just got this computer a few months ago so it isn't loaded with stuff.- the backup files are in a rdb,rbc so only the software can read the files- the multi languaged manuals are almost worthless, there is very little information in them-I don't like that it uses a web browser to access the setting and setup for this (my HP server doesn't need to use a web browser but is available through my network)-- I may not understand this part but I wanted to copy info from my PC to the public folder and I can't? I will try it with another storage device, maybe that will work. I can't drop files into the folder but it seems any emails it tells me that it can't copy all the info?I have netgear dual band router, motorola ISP modem, win vista (I also have XP on another PC and the xp apparently can't find this thing without using the software.)", "I have been looking at owning an external server for storage but decided when I saw this Iomega StorCenter ix2 - 200 with 2TB, this was the solution for me.We are a networked household and this is what our set-up uses:Linksys by Cisco WRT160N-RM Refurbished Wireless-N Router(this is a GREAT deal).Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopardon aApple MacBook Pro MC118LL/A 15.4-Inch LaptopMicrosoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgradeon a Dell XPS M1530 laptopMicrosoft Windows XP Home Edition FULL VERSION with SP2on a Dell desktopThe initial installation was done using Windows 7 and was a breeze.  The Iomega software was very user friendly and even if one is not a huge techie, it is workable.  The CD that comes with the software contains the Iomega hardware setup software (you can name your new storage device as you connect it to your router, etc.).  The instructions are very easy to follow and once you plug the storage device into your router (like mine:Linksys by Cisco WRT160N-RM Refurbished Wireless-N Router), the setup is a breeze.While I am typing this, two of our computers are getting complete backups.  The other software that comes on the setup CD is EMC Retrospect Express HD.  This is the software that lets a user set up back-ups automatically and do a back-up right out of the box (what I am doing).  Doing the backup in no way impinges the use of my network and laptop.  These events can take place simultaneously.I expect that I will begin to really explore this device and use it for Bit Torrent, cameras, videos, etc.  I just can't wait to explore what I can do with 2TB.The form factor is fantastic and sturdy.  I put the unit on it's side and put the Linksys hub on top of it.  This provided a nice layout and I don't think that heat will be a problem at all.Total set-up time from box, to network, to 2 PCs, and 1 Mac = 1 hour.  I give this great little unit 5 stars.", "\"For a massive storage solution for my office, storcenter performs well. If you wana look at a cool device, well it is not that \"\"cool\"\" as it gets really warm. But the RAID configuration, setup, access to share folders, remote access are all fitting in well for the expectation of a high-level usability.\"", "\"My husband has been telling me for some time we needed a network storage device, however we have a couple portable storage devices which work just fine (you know assuming I take the time to plug them in and update everything which sounds easy enough but never seems to happen) and the price scared me away and always left me saying \"\"yeah yeah eventually\"\". Well eventually has come and who knew, not only did we really need one but I LOVE it!We both use a macbook and with one child and another baby due in 2 months to say I take a lot of photos and video would be an understatement, my mac is always overloaded with files that I needed to transfer to one of the storage drives, which of course reside in the home office and not on the livingroom sofa where my macbook tends to live. Of course once I do transfer things then I realize I need that photo, or that movie... but they are up on the storage drive.. GRRRR. Our macs also come with timemachine but again, that would mean lugging it up to the office and hooking it to the old drive. Sounds easy, never happens. Not an issue anymore! I back up my files immediately over our wireless network, I can access any and all of our movies and videos anytime I want them, timemachine does its thing w/o me even thinking about it. Heck even our PS3 found the drive and all the movies I have stored on it can be played now w/o having to hook up my daughters ipod to the tv!!!!! Did I mention that I love this thing?!?!Set up was super easy, I saw someone say they couldn't get it to work wirelessly but our macs had no issue at all, just tossed in the included disk and everything went smoothly. My old basement desktop PC was equally easy to setup and honestly now that I have the NAS I've transfered all the files I used to store on it (my temp solution to being to lazy to go plug in the storage drives was to save things over the network to the old pc) I've decided to reformat that and donate it as I simply don't need it anymore. I haven't had to much luck with hooking up my canon all in one printer, well I should say I haven't had luck with it and the macs... I have no trouble printing from the desktop over the network but for some reason the macs aren't working yet... I'll keep working at it though.It's small and compact and although it is a bit noisy it's not overwhelmingly so, plus we keep it with the routers in the basement so I never hear it making it a  non-issue for us.I haven't configured it so that we can access it over the web yet but that is our next project, my husband is really excited at the idea of hosting his work projects on it and being able to access them from anywhere on any computer.\"", "\"3yrs ago, I purchased a US Robotics USR8700 NAS - about 1.2TB usable as RAID-0, unit has functioned without incident. 2yrs ago, I purchased a Buffalo TeraStation Pro TS-HTGL - about 2.8TB usable as RAID-0, unit has also worked well.ALL MY EQUIPMENT is plugged into 6 different TrippLite UPS Backup Power Supply's with Surge Protection - thats well over $7000.00 of Hardware, my full Entertainment System, my Gaming Consoles, my HTPC system, my Stereo System, and my 6 Computer systems - along with the Gig Switches, Firewall, Cable Modem and what was all 3 NAS systems (USRobotics, Buffalo and this new Iomega).Then, running out of storage space once more, I found this unit - while ratings where not stellar by any means, the footprint concept and simplicity described seemed like a nice little solution that I would hope to get 2yrs from - until I got into a new, single point solution with far larger space in the future. So I thought, Iomega...I worked with their Zip Drives what seems like decades ago - their still around making storage solutions, what the heck.This unit was super simple to setup, came as RAID-1, I reconfigured for RAID-0 via the Web GUI - really user friendly, better than the other 2 I already had - was up and pouring in my 500+GB Music Collection (as a backup) and about 100 shows (another backup).Most my storage needs are for REDUNDANT files, no terrible disappointments if/when loss of a single storage location....well 3 weeks into using this Iomega StorCenter ix2 device, on a Saturday AM - it simply became unreachable. No availability via Mapped Network Drives (5 systems access it), no PINGs, no Web GUI, no Software Mgmt access...NOTHING!!!! Power light was on, nothing else happening.Had a trip to Orlando, Florida that Sat night...for 12 days.Got back from my trip, contacted Amazon, who then cited that because the 30-days had passed (during my trip out of town), they were unable to provide any support or return assistance, instead directing me to Iomega for further technical support.Having registered the unit, for extended 3yrs Firmware/Hardware Warranty - I called Iomega Tech Support, reached English speaking support in moments, dealt with them for 1.5hrs, getting essentially no where.The units White Power LED simply blinks quickly....nothing else! A disappointment in that there is no real notification for us end-users of what its doing, where its hanging up, whats transpiring via a LCD or likes.Was told Tech felt it was a Linux Firmware Issue - and he would send me a NEW USB Stick, with NEW/recent Firmware to correct this problem. Received this USB 7 days later, obviously no rush on their part!!!Was directed to Power unit off, insert USB stick into any available USB port (chose front one), depress and hold the &lt;--> transfer button while powering on the unit simultaneously - hold the transfer button for about 20 seconds.Performing this on my own, several times, all 3 USB ports - being that the USB stick itself ALSO LACKED any indicators of activity (uh, flashing lights when its being accessed would have been really helpful, but none present) - I called again, asked for assistance and was walked thru steps by a tech.Tech cited, okay, let it run for about 15min, call back if it does not self shut down and restart, then it should be usable.I called back 20min later, same position....other tech says, no, you have to wait at least 30min for it to power cycle on its own.Waited for 45min, same position...Called back, the support said would transfer to L3 Engineer for support, that THEY would contact me within 48hrs.4-days later, went into ticketing system asking for someone to contact me...having not heard from them.Told via email, that I had to call in for RMA process.After another 30+ minutes, and the RMA tech offering me 3 options;1 mail in and await replacement2 for $50, they would 3 day me a replacement, and i can mail mine back3 for $40, they could overnight me a replacement, and i can mail mine backFirst, I asked, why theres been no discussion about data recovery?Next, I said the unit failed within a mere 3 weeks usage, I want to speak to a manager because after spending over $400 for the unit via Amazon, extending the warranty and now loosing hours of time - and the need to REDO all my data again - I WILL NOT PAY either, the $50 or the $40!!!!Tech asked me to hold, returned few moments later, says manager offered to waive the fees - they will overnight me a replacement (this was Friday, April 22 @ 10am) - I said, so I will get it tomorrow, Saturday - Tech says probably not, more like Monday or possibly Tuesday....I dont know about him, but overnight on a Friday, means arrival on a Saturday....WHATEVER!!!!And thus, I am conveying my information to this review now that its Saturday, April 23 @ 5pm and I am awaiting a replacement of a brand new device, that was in use for less than 1 month, thats now literally unusable, Iomega made no offer to retrieve data which is all copies anyhow, whose support has cost me about 10-days time, 2-3 hours on the phone, who also wanted me to pay ANOTHER $40-$50 for the replacement, that is being overnighted, but will arrive in 3-4 days time....So there you have it....that is my experience and I hope it helps future buyers to know what they MAY encounter from their purchase of this Iomega StorCenter ix2 NAS storage unit.I hope others have better luck than I have!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE FRIDAY APRIL 29 2011Received the replacement NAS unit on Tuesday, April 26, 2011Arrived with just unit, nothing else - I reused original cablesBrought system up, Web GUI'd into it and redid all the share directories - then re-copied my files overProceeded to print the pre-paid UPS Shipping label, repackaged in same materials received in and will drop off to UPS at no charge to me (this part was very fair of Iomega, although they originally wanted me to pay $40-$50)Once more, unit is working fine as of today - fingers crossed it stays working for at least a year to two!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE FRIDAY MARCH 17 2012NOW DROPPED RATING FROM 2-Stars to 1-StarToo bad 0-Star isnt an option.As of yesterday, I've totally given up on this Iomega StorCenter product. Over the last few months, the Web GUI has been intermittently unreachable, digital tv shows recorded with Windows Media Center \"\"stored\"\" on the unit consistently failed to stream properly (video/audio jumping around), and moving or copying tv shows (about 3-5GB each) back and forth among this unit and all my Media Centers (8 total) I've recently been seeing drive not available or worse, not enough space/drive full messages when it clearly showed over 200gb free space. I am completely dissatisfied with this product....all the while, my original US Robotics and Buffalo TeraStation systems have provided several years of problem free usage.As of yesterday, I bought this product on Amazon;Synology DiskStation 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS212j (White)I removed the (2) 2TB Seagate Hard Disk Drives from the Iomega StorCenter, installed them and after about 20min time installing the DiskStation Manager (DSM) Software for the Synology and 8+ hours of Hard Drive sector-by-sector inspection analysis, I now have BOTH drives seemingly fully functional receiving over 1.5TB worth of recorded TV shows at this very moment. If they remain working, my guess is it was the StorCenter itself, either its Hardware or Firmware....whatever, we customers buy these units to work - not fail or be intermittent, just work, give us a few years (or more) of reasonable support and service...I guess its too much to ask of the Iomega product!I have no clue what I will do with the Iomega (perhaps eBay it for spare parts???), but this has been my own experience and I feel its worth sharing to future buyers that can learn from us, not only does an ORIGINAL NEW UNIT fail within weeks, but a REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT UNIT subsequently failed approx. 1 year later rendering it essentially just useless.Sure, I could ONCE MORE spend hours/days/weeks trying to work with Iomega support \"\"again\"\"....been there, done that, also a bad experience that I do not wish to repeat.I consider my time of more value than going another round with them as noted in the original review above. Lots of time, effort and waiting - forget it, dont want it, dont need it. YES, even though its suppose to be covered for 3 years via registration - into it from original purchase date now for about 16 months time. Still covered I presume, but not worth my time or $$$ dealing with them ever again because of this miserable experience.We'll stay with our US Robotics (over 4yrs old), Buffalo TeraStation (over 3yrs old) and now Synology DiskStation moving forward.I hope we'll have far better luck with the recent Synology product vs. the Iomega!!! Even 2 or 3 good years, with the same Seagate HDD (were in the Iomega) would be considered a reasonable victory to me.Hope this is helpful to anyone considering this product.I understand, each buyers mileage will vary =)If you do buy this, good luck and I hope it works out, more importantly, lasts longer for you....that certainly was not our experiences.\"", "\"Storage Device ReviewWith the explosion in the amount of data all of us generate, and how important computers have become, I think a device like this is a must-have for the modern household. Like many things in the modern consumer technology space, though, this unit is still too complicated, I believe, for the average home user to setup easily and use to its maximum potential.My husband gets to be our in-house IT guy - one of the 'benefits' (although he doesn't see it as such necessarily) of working in the tech industry. With his help, I've broken this review up into the following 4 sections:- Setup- Daily use- Maintenance & PC Backups- General NotesSetupWe had no issues with this, but I would strongly recommend that you read the manual and follow the steps. While fairly straightforward, accessing the device from a computer - which you'll need to do to ultimately configure it completely - can prove to be tricky depending on your individual setup - i.e., what kind of router you use, what PCs you use to access this device, etc. Knowing what IP address is assigned to the device can come in real handy. Of note: you'll have the choice to set this up as a 2 TB or 1 TB device - the 1 TB is better since it makes 2 copies of your data, meaning that even if one of the hard disks crashes, the other one will have a copy of everything you put on here.Daily useWhile Iomega might have a proclivity to have you connect to this device only through the included `software' - in quotes because all it *really* is is a browser link that connects to the device - to truly use the full potential of this device, you will want to connect to it using a file explorer (Windows Explorer to everyone on a PC). The way to do this is to enter the name of the device (which you'll have chosen during setup) preceded by two back slashes \"\"\\\\\"\". Here's where knowing the IP address can come in handy: if Windows is not able to find this device, you can use the same back slashes and the IP address and that'll almost always ensure that Windows does find this storage unit.The other thing that's useful to know going in is that by default, Windows will store the username and password you first use while accessing the device. That's convenient, but not if you setup multiple user accounts - a very likely scenario, for instance, to separate what you want everyone to be able to access as opposed to what you want to keep private. You'll have to configure Windows to not remember the default password if you want to use this most useful feature.For best performance, you'll also want to ensure that the device is connected by a network cable to the router - and connect your laptop to one as well if you are transferring a large amount of data (such as performing a backup, for instance).The remote web access is super useful, but only available through a browser. The unit does have an in-built slideshow feature, so this can be useful to view pictures over the internet directly from the unit.Copying or moving files from one folder on the unit to the other is where we encountered a lot of frustration. This is a task you can kind of accomplish from the browser interface, and where you can, you should - however, there are times when you want to use a program like Windows Explorer to manage files. Any copy / move operation done from a computer via Windows Explorer seems to first copy the file over to that computer and then move or copy it to the destination folder on the device, making such operations much slower than one would like. However, be warned: the duplicate file protection built into the browser is a little too powerful and will overwrite files without really explaining to you that that's what it's about to do.The USB ports were super handy as well for copying data from either external hard disks (or old internal hard disks) and flash drives. The `one-click transfer button' on the device didn't function reliably though; I'd suggest using either the web interface (preferred) or Windows Explorer to do the trick.Maintenance & PC BackupsThere are no regular maintenance tasks as such - which is awesome. The unit seems to have built-in routines for maintenance tasks such as defragmentation; mirroring is transparent to the end user; and in general, maintenance was not an issue at all. It'll even email you if the router fails (naturally the email only goes out when the router comes back online...) which is good to know.Backups also worked well. We didn't use the backup software the unit came with - my husband is a firm believer in not installing any more software than necessary on our laptops, and most modern laptops and operating systems come with perfectly capable backup utilities. Good to note though that this device does come with backup software. I would strongly suggest making backups a regularly scheduled task - this device makes those a no-brainer.General NotesAll-in-all this is a very capable device for the price. It is a little noisy - I agree with other reviewers that have said it sounds like a coffee maker at times - so you will want to install it in a place where the noise will not bother you, but which is relatively cool and well ventilated at the same time (the disks can run pretty warm). It's a well-built device, with a very nice black brushed metal finish.\"", "This is an updated review.  My original review was a glowing endorsement of the NAS, when it worked great.  Unfortunately, that honeymoon period only lasted a few weeks and now I see what I'm REALLY stuck with.  All I can say is stay away from this one.For the first few weeks, this NAS knocked my socks off.  It was fast and reliable.  I used roughly half of the (mirrored) capacity to backup and store my data.  I also setup media sharing to share music, photos, and videos among the household.  The NAS was purring along and we were all happy.  Then things suddenly went downhill, fast.  The first signs of trouble began a few days after I wrote my original glowing review here on Amazon, (as luck would have it).  I was awakened from my sleep at 4am by the NAS, which was making a pretty good racket.  Now, it's not a quiet drive to begin with, but when it's spinning madly at full speed at 4am, you realize how loud it really is (and how sleep is all but impossible if it's nearby).  I don't know why it suddenly decided to start spinning like mad every night at 4am.  It literally sounds like someone is copying the entire drive every night at that time.  I disabled all jobs and automated processes on the NAS, tweaked my firewall and router settings, and even denied all access to the NAS from other network devices, yet it continues to spin like mad, for some odd unknown reason, at 4am.  It also never stops spinning in general.  It constantly grinds away, all day and night, although not as vigorously or loudly as the 4am mystery sessions, but you hear it grinding every few seconds and it's very annoying.  Despite setting the power management option to allow the disks to sleep after an hour of inactivity, they never shut down, even if every other networked device in the house is turned off.  In the beginning, power management worked fine.  I could even tell when the drives were spinning up after prolonged inactivity.  Like most of the other good things about the NAS, it just stopped working properly.The noise is annoying, but if it were the only problem, I could deal with it.  But the NAS also decided to start randomly going offline.  One minute I'd have mapped drives and could reach the NAS via UNC path, the next minute it is unreachable.  The NAS usually reappears after a minute or two, but on one occasion, I had to reboot the NAS to restore connectivity.  Even more alarming, is that it has also dropped several times during file transfers, resulting in data loss.  Once, when it crashed, it took my router with it, knocking everyone in the house offline.  After the last drop, any large file transfers causes the NAS to drop.  In other words, it is now useless, unless I want to back up a 100KB > file.  That's what prompted me to update this review and yank off four stars in the process, the unreliability.  When I initially started using the NAS, it was great.  I backed up 500 GB of data (most of it over wireless) without any problems.  Now, I can't even back up 100MB without the NAS dropping after the first 10MB or so.  My router is not the problem because we routinely share large files among our PC's with no problems.  Prior to purchasing the NAS, two USB drives were my back up option and my laptop was the home server for sharing music, movies, and pictures.  I THOUGHT the NAS would take over those duties, and initially it did, and did so admirably, as I shared in my original review.  However, I'm now back to backing up on my original USB drives and using my primary computer as the media server. Not sure what I'm going to do with the NAS, but it certainly won't be trusted for backing up any valuable data.  I've already lost enough files to this beast.  I've tried every setting and firmware update available.  Nothing solves the above issues.", "Excellent size, fit over any please, not noisy and fast. Buy this product was the result of a large process of evaluating an research... this is the best for a home storage with a big plus of raid backup. Hightly recommended. The installation was easy, I preffer use a static IP (reserved IP from gigabit router) to do more easy the setup.", "PROEasy installBasic functionality successful - - data sharing w RAIDCONNoisy- - sounds like a '52 Buick on a rough roadFlakey - - I configured it for open access w/o password. But each time I reboot my Win7 client, the first time I try to access the drive it demands a user/password. I key in a random info (user asdf, password qwerty) and it lets me in - - what??It just went out of warranty and immediately one of the mirrored drives crashed. This might be my cue to dump Iomega and switch back to a Buffalo brand drive instead of swapping the crashed drive.", "For data sharing on LAN this is the best option coz when I checked out a few other brands they were of a much higher cost and not with too many positives. Although of a lower price and wid all my doubts about its life, now I feel I have taken the right one for my LAN - 9 PCs. No errors or troubles discovered yet. I don't need the camera surveillance but the network printer is a real big plus. Fast on connection, quiet.", "\"The unit is fast and quiet, seems stable and reliable (no problems or disconnects so far). Because I use it not only for backup but for storage of shared files and media libraries, I need the unit itself to be backed up, too (\"\"backup of backup\"\"). I attached an external drive and created Copy Jobs, which worked great. However, I found that the unit treats the external drive as one of its native folders and automatically scans it for media contents. Unfortunately, even though you tell the unit's media server where your media folder is, it still scans everything. As a result, the media server presented every song twice when using iTunes shared library feature (which I like and use a lot on multiple PC's on the network) - one from the designated media folder and another from its backup on the external drive. Bummer! I found this impossible to overcome (help me if you can). I wish there were a way to tell the unit which folders to scan for media contents, but there isn't - it scans all folders and makes everything it finds available over UPnP, including files in backup space on the external USB drive. Next, I tried to add another NAS (Buffalo LinkStation I already had) to the network and have the unit backup to LinkStation instead of the external drive. The copy job feature didn't work with Buffalo - when setting up a copy job the destination folders could not be reached. I thought it was just because Iomega didn't like Buffalo, so I purchased another Iomega StorCenter ix2-200, thinking the two StorCenters are bound to talk to each other. That failed as well with the same exact pattern. I talked to Iomega support which was eager to tell me they were having problems with this feature (NAS to NAS Copy Job) but don't have it on the urgent fixes list - they are trying to make their products as perfect as possible, but just don't have the time. Bottom line - it is a very good system to use for backup, which I would highly recommend, but it didn't suite my other needs. I hope to see improvements in future firmware releases at some point.\"", "\"First impressions with this new Iomega Network Attached Store device are positive. The construction is pretty, made of some aluminum-like metal on the outside which looks like it does a nice job of dissipating heat when the device is on.Setup wasn't too difficult. Plug the AC cord into the Iomega, and a network cable from the device to your router. Despite what others have said, I had NO issues setting the NAS up over my wireless network. While the Iomega isn't wireless itself, my setup is as follows:Iomega NAS hardwired --> Apple Time Capsule which my 2009 MacBook Pro connects to wirelessly. No problems at all.The Iomega has Time Capsule support, which I attempted to disable in the setup menus, but for whatever reason it still finds Time_Capsule as a computer name under my shared devices, which I found rather irritating.In terms of usage, I created a folder on the network-drive, and was able to transfer my files without any issue from all my systems. No issues.Except one.And it's a big one.If you want to use this in a small apartment where you're anywhere near this Iomega ix2-200, make sure you wear earplugs. I recall a review that said it sounds like a coffee grinder, and that about describes it. I think I also recall the term \"\"garbage disposal in the distance.\"\" Inside the enclosure are two 1TB Seagate 5900rpm drives (yes, not 5400rpm). I even pulled them out to check that they weren't 7200rpm drives because of the noise, and nope, they're definitely some of the newer 5900rpm spinners! I don't know how Seagate managed to release drives that make such a racket, but hey, they managed it! Personally, I couldn't bear the grinding sounds after limited use, and wished this NAS had wifi support so I could plug it in in a different room. Oh well.Overall, a fine device. I had no real functionality issues per se, but the noise really got to me so if you're going to be anywhere near it be sure to turn your music up!3.5/5 for those of you using it in a small room.4.5/5 for those with a dedicated server room.\"", "Quick Summary: The Iomega StorCenter Pro ix2-200 is a simple, inexpensive, well-built, easy-to-use, network attached storage (NAS) device.  The software, however, has the same rich feature set used by its more expensive cousin, the StorCenter ix4-200d.  If you're in the market for a NAS that gives you data redundancy (through RAID 1, that is, through data mirroring using two, user-replaceable hard drives), then this is a very good choice.  If I didn't already own another StorCenter and Windows Home Server (both of which are terrific products, but with their own quirks), I think I'd be thrilled with this little ix2-200.Background: I'm not a SOHO customer, so I used the same test as when I reviewed the Iomega 2 TB StorCenter ix4-200d Network Attached Storage Server (34546).  I tried consolidating my external hard drives onto this StorCenter ix2-200.  Since I already backup my networked computers using anAcer Aspire AH340-UA230N Home Server, I didn't test the backup/restore functions.Although this has two terabytes of storage, it's using RAID 1, meaning that everything that is written to the first disk is also written to the second disk, too.  If one disk fails, all your data is safely protected on the 2nd disk.  Just hot-swap the bad disk with a new, good disk, (like theWestern Digital 1 TB Caviar Green SATA Intellipower 32 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive WD10EADS [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] and this unit will automatically mirror your data onto the new drive.  That's the key difference between this NAS and some other NAS devices that have only one drive -- you have built-in data redundancy to keep your data safe when one drive fails.INSTALLATIONInstalling the StorCenter ix2-200 was very easy. Any experienced home user can install this in a home or small office network.  Simply plug-in the power cord (to a UPS, not just a surge protector alone!), plug-in the ethernet cable to connect the StorCenter ix2-200 to your router (or hub), and press the power button on the front of the unit. I thought my home server and the ix4-200d were small, but they're huge compared to this NAS!  It's about one-third the size of the Acer home server or the StorCenter ix4-200d!  I thought it was quiet, too, though you will hear it if it's on your desk where you work.Iomega could make the out-of-box experience better by providing a full-sized, color, installation poster that also describes the key functions of setting up backup jobs, creating security accounts, and more.  The multi-language manuals they do provide are insufficient for understanding how to install and use the ix2-200 (but the CD has the info you'd expect to see).Once the hardware is installed, pop in the installation CD on any networked computer (I used one that had a wired connection to my router). The software installation was straight-forward and down-to-business -- no cute intros or videos -- but it was an easy process. You're installing two programs: the mandatory program is the StorCenter's management console (which is rendered via a web browser), and the optional program is the Retrospect backup/restore software. The software automatically finds the StorCenter on your network, and you get to setup the administrator account/password and name the storage device whatever you please (you can change the name later if you want). If you're not an IT person, don't worry -- this is as simple as setting up a user account in Windows.The interface is exactly the same as what's used for other iOmega StorCenter devices, so if you've been using another StorCenter unit, then you'll know exactly how to manage this ix2-200, too.If you register the ix2-200 online within 90 days of first using it, you get THREE years of warranty service from iOmega.The StorCenter creates a Public folder (with a Documents and Media subfolders) that can be accessible to anyone on your network. It also creates a Backup folder, too, for use with the Restrospect backup/restore software. Each user account you create gets its own, protected folder, too.In very short order, I was able to use Windows Explorer to find the new StorCenter's Public folder. No hitches at all to the initial set-up.Note that going to Settings, Update in the StorCenter's web-based management console indicates that the firmware is up-to-date.  It wasn't, though.  By clicking the Iomega's support link on that page, I found a later firmware release that's available.  To install it, download it to your PC, then use the StorCenter's interface to point to the downloaded file so it can install the 100MB firmware update.  Note that I didn't have any problem using the StorCenter without doing the update.CONFIGURATIONThe StorCenter runs Linux internally. So, I was happy to find that the web-based interface was easy to use and, more often than not, pretty intuitive in where you go to find something. The software uses five tabs: Home, Dashboard, Users, Shared Storage and Settings:- The Home tab gives you icons and links to most-often functions, like adding a printer or creating a user.- The Dashboard tab shows space used, the unit's IP and serial number, and buttons to restart or turn-off your StorCenter- The Users tab lets you create user accounts if you wish to have secured access to your network storage. You can either let anyone and everyone get access (probably not a good idea), or you'll have to create user accounts and decide what kind of access (read, write, administrator) each user gets. You can assign quotas, too, for each user (so they don't use up too much space on the shared pool). BTW, for you IT workers out there, my home network doesn't use Active Directory, but the StorCenter supports AD. Most very small businesses and home offices won't use Active Directory, either.- The Shared Storage tab shows the folder structure of the shared storage pool (like what Windows Explorer does).- The Settings tab is a collection of icons that let you exploit the many functions and features of this device.  This is where I clicked to begin the process of doing a firmware update.USABILITYThe unit has a QuikTransfer button on the front.  If you add an external storage device to the USB port on the front of the ix2-200, it immediately prepares to copy the entire contents of the external storage drive into a newly-created folder under the QuikTransfer folder on the ix2-200.  To initiate the copy function, press the QuikTransfer button the front of the unit.  That launches the copy job, and that job copies everything to the ix2-200.  Go to Settings, Backup Jobs to see the progress of the copy job, or to otherwise manage the copy/backup jobs.I tried using this function using two of the three external drives I used when testing the ix4-200d.  On a USB-powered hard drive, I only got a data transfer speed of 34Mbps, which was about the same as when I was transferring these same files onto the ix4-200d. It took a little more than 2 hours to move 60,000 files and 33GB of data.  On my externally-powered, modern, 500GB Seagate USB drive, it moved 494GB of data in about 13.5 hours, which was two hours slower than when I copied the data onto the StorCenter ix4-200d.  The transfer speed was 82Mbps -- faster than the USB-powered drive, but still slower than what USB 2.0 can achieve.When doing a data transfer using the Gigabit Ethernet connection between this StorCenter and my Windows Home Server (through a router that supports Gigabit Ethernet), I was able to move a 4GB file in 2.5 minutes.  The network utilization was about 25%.A few minor design complaints: The power-on button on the front is not indented inward, so it could be accidentally bumped.  Worse, it's not distinguished from the QuikTransfer button which is the same shape and size just below the power button.  Hope you don't press the wrong button when doing a data transfer!  Also, the QuikTransfer button is too close to the USB port, so when the USB cable is plugged-in, it's not easy to press the QuikTransfer button if you have big hands.The unit was warm (not hot) to the touch while doing the data transfers.SUPPORTNote for D-Link DIR-655 users:  On the StorCenter ix4-200d, I encountered an issue where uploading to the StorCenter worked fine, but downloading from the StorCenter only trickled to both wired and wireless computers, using just 1% of the network capacity. (I don't know if that could also be a problem with the StorCenter ix2-200, too, but since it's using the same Linux operating system, I suppose it might be a problem).  Support calls to both Iomega and D-Link convinced me it's a D-Link issue.  So, I bought theLinksys by Cisco WRT320N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gigabit Routerrouter, and have had no similar issues.When I did I did contact Iomega tech support, it was easy to do via phone.  I reached North America, not India. Moreover, the two technicians I dealt with were capable and helpful, and one in particular expertly walked me through diagnostic steps showing that the StorCenter's networking functions were working correctly. Basic warranty service is 9am - 10pm Eastern, Monday through Friday.CONCLUSIONThere are a ton of other features that I haven't begun to explore yet.  I *really like* the ease with which I installed this storage device -- my second NAS unit. I like the ease of consolidating my data using the QuikTransfer feature. I'm satisfied with the speed of the data transfer, although it's nowhere near the data transfer capacity of USB 2.0 (so I don't know where the bottleneck is, but then I don't really care, either). I like how simple it was to create user accounts, and that Windows Explorer saw this device without any trouble at all.  I like the three-year warranty service.  And this device is so small, it can fit easily just about anywhere!Final word: Visit the Iomega website and check-out their Solutions documents which give a terrific overview of many functions that are built-in to the StorCenter ix2-200. I learned quite a bit just reading over their many documents that describe RAID, Torrents, and more. Although I created an Iomega account, I haven't figured out how to open a support ticket with Iomega -- I can see my Case History, but there is no place to open a new ticket (stupid!)."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.003438538173213601, 0.08466948568820953, 0.24664823710918427, 0.17342379689216614, 0.18696308135986328, 0.0016309558413922787, 0.00012759571836795658, 0.01949160359799862, 0.0024683221708983183, 0.2348325103521347, 0.005082578863948584, 0.002139268908649683, 0.005361279938369989, 0.03363567218184471, 8.7066633568611e-05]]}
