I concluded from that experience that I'm done with carbon fiber, because it is simply not sturdy enough in high wind situations (on the coast, in Death Valley, at home). High winds being 20 mph or more, a very common challenge, nothing out of the ordinary. This tripod here is made of aluminum, heavy enough to hold steady and very solidly built, stiff legs that don't move on their own. It also has a hook to add weight or mount it to the ground. One star.I wanted a tall tripod that puts my camera at eye level. I am 5'-11\"\" and with ball head and my Nikon D4, the viewfinder is perfectly at eye level when this tripod is fully extended. Very good solution for that and Induro has a whole series of heights to match what you need. With center column extended, the camera extends way over my head for shooting above crowds or fences. I also wanted a tripod that has only 3 sections to minimize the screw-screw-screw to unlock the legs. Another winner on that, Induro is one of very few companies who makes tall tripods matching that criteria. Two more stars here.I wanted screw-type leg locks, I don't like the lever locks. Another plus here, but I do dislike the screw locks, the hard contoured plastic doesn't feel good in your hand. I prefer the knurled rubberized type (e.g., Benro has that down pat, Vanguard feels good, too). It works, just doesn't feel good. You also need to unscrew these at least one half turn to unlock the legs, otherwise you cannot pull/push the legs. One more star, half taken away.I need a tripod that has adjustable leg angles and this is the biggest drawback of these tripods: to adjust the angle, you have to take your hand off the tripod and pull out the stopper, which remains open until you push it back in. There is no indication on what the leg position is, whether you hit the next stop or the second next stop. I prefer the type where the stopper auto-retracts and you only need to release it momentarily until the leg unlocks, but then pops back in and the leg auto-stops at the next setting. Example: my wobbly leg Vanguard had a side push button with auto-release. You didn't have to take your hand off, simply pushed the button with the thumb and adjusted the legs with the rest of the hand. On the Induro, this is an iterative process with hands off and on. I need something that works fast without me having to think about what I'm doing. Another half star subtracted.I wanted an articulating center column, one that can be taken out and back in perpendicular to the tripod for very low close-to-ground shooting, but also to extend the camera out, e.g., through a fence or gate. Induro doesn't have that on this series, period.The product gets another half star for covering all three legs with foam, not just one or two like most other tripods. It loses half a star for the center column not being reversible.Last minor gripe: the ball head mounting base comes loose too easily, especially when trying to unscrew the ball head. Had no problems with that yet, but I fear that it will screw loose at an inappropriate time when you are in some vibrating environment and don't pay attention.Overall I give it 3 stars, it is \"\"OK\"\", but in fairness and to put this rating in perspective: I haven't found any tripod that I would give 4 stars, let alone 5. And from what I see in terms of features and what I'm looking for, I doubt that even much higher pricing will get me that.I really like the sturdy and solid quality, tripod height without center column extended and the very low price point for that. Recommended, if the features match your desires. So far, it's the best tripod I owned, but I keep looking. And playing with the idea of creating my own. :-)\"", "It's over 7lbs and heavy but I bought it for studio use and not for lugging it great outdoors for landscape shoots. Weight is the only drawback but everything else is perfect. Unless you are using a FF DSLR with large zoom lens or a medium/large format view camera, this thing might be bit of an overkill for most consumer DSLR and lens setup, but if weight and size be damned, and want a rock solid tripod period, then this tripod is for you.  It has maximum load capability of 44 lbs, equivalent to three medium weight bowling ball.I prefer the twistlock over lever lock as I always seem to bust a lever soon or later. It comes with adjustment tools, metal spikes and stout carry bag that can accomodate a large ball head. Standard center column is not too long and does not compromise overall stability.It is made in China but it is very well-made with excellent fit and finish. They probably copied some other well known design. You'd be hard pressed to find another brand of tripod in this price range with similar capabilities and features.  You can get carbon fiber models with similar features that weigh 1/3 less but it will cost you 3 -5 times much as what this tripod costs.  It comes with 5 yr. warranty that can be extended to 10 yrs. if you register online.Highly recommended!", "I don't want to spend over $500 on a carbon fiber tripod, so I decided to try the Induro AT-413. It handles the bigger cameras and lenses with ease. There are only 3 leg sections instead of 4, so extending the legs is quicker than a 4 section. Trick-if you're not too tall, like me, just leave the lowest sections extended a few inches all the time. Then you only have to extend ONE set to get to eye level. I cut about 3 inches off the center column so the column will retract all the way when legs are fully spread out. That allows me to get lower for those low macro shots. After shortening it, I put the bottom hook back on it so I can still hang a weight or camera bag from it. I paired it up with an Arca Swiss Z1 ball head and have been loving this setup. First I had the Induro BHD2 ball head and didn't like that head.Yes it's very heavy. And it is still long retracted. If you fly and need to travel light, this is probably not a good choice. If you hike long distances, you may not want to carry it that far. But when you travel in the car like I do all the time this is the one to bring.", "Extremely pleased with this tripod.  It's finely made, reasonably light considering that it's metal instead of carbon fiber, and versatile with multiple leg angles and sections.  It is very solid and stable when loaded with an 8 lb camera and superzoom lens.  The only tripod I would recommend over this is the carbon fiber Induro, if you can afford it.  It's also professional looking with a satin black finish and nicely machined parts in the spider.  You are getting the tripod only, no head.  It uses a standard threaded screw to attach the head of your choice.  I'm using the Joby Ballhead X.", "I've had this tripod for a couple of weeks now, and am totally satisfied. I've taken it on a couple of long wilderness treks and find that it's not too heavy (the carbon fiber model is only 0.9 lbs lighter... not enough of a difference for the $350 price difference between the two). The fit and finish is very good and the leg locks work perfectly. I prefer the twist-type locks because, even on expensive tripods, the lever-type seem to always loosen over time. It's very sturdy and holds my camera, battery grip, flash, 70-300mm lens and Induro gimbal head without breaking a sweat. I will soon be getting a Canon 500mm f/4 and have no doubts that it will handle the weight of that, too.", "Used it couple of times and the legs work so smooth, the head is solid. I have a Vanguard 300 ball head and soon will replace it with a Gimbal head. It's a bit long, but comes in a bag and hope to make it a part of my carry on luggage and don't have to check it in.", "Have you noticed there are no one star reviews of this tripod as of Jan '14? That's impressive since you could sell a bar if diamond encrusted gold on amazon, and someone would still give it a one star review.This review is meant for newbies to photography. Many people out there are going to get into photography and, when there skill level advances, feel the need to buy better camera bodies and glass. Although buying new lenses will make an improvement, there is absolutely NO substitute for proper technique in you photography. Part of that technique is making it a point to use a tripod as often as possible; take it from me, I've been shooting for years and only now came to the realization that I have been severely limiting the potential of my photos by not routinely using a tripod.Having said all that, you need to buy a GOOD tripod right from the start. Do not go cheap or you will end up referring it. However, cheap does not mean you need to spend a fortune; you just need to avoid cheap quality.Enter, the Induro 8m. This is a pro level tripod for a bargain of a price. For 150$, you can get a solid set of legs that will hold steady in the wind, in irregular terrain and for long exposure shots.It is by no means a travel tripod. It is light but bulky. However, I find that the bulk does help to add to the stability. For a much smaller, lighter tripod, I'd look at the Manfrotto BeFree, although it can't hold a candle to the Induros stability.If you are strapped for cash, PLEASE buy this stable tripod before you look into a travel tripod. You can always make a makeshift tripod in the field if you need to, but start off with a solid tankI have the 213/65inch model, and as a 6-foot guy, the viewfinder just reaches my eye with a four inch ball head mount. Very nice! I've never had a tripod that is tall enough for thisThe legs are very stable, even at their lowest point and the wide stance of the tripod is very stable. The column has a great weight hook for clipping your camera bag to for extra stability and it comes with a high quality, padded bag.The legs themselves also extend their width for getting low to the ground for macro photography.All in all, my long search for the perfect Balkan e of price, stability and features was over when I discovered this tripod.It's too heavy to bring on hardcore backwoods hikes but, then again, so is my dslr itself.Give this tripod a try. Make sure to measure up to your eye, then figure out which model is the right height for you; and keep in mind that you still have to purchase a ball head.", "\"After a year of using a Dolica AX620B100 62-Inch Proline Tripod and Ball Head I decided to give it to my son \"\"forcing\"\" me to upgrade.  I did a LOT of research and narrowed my choice to the Induro AT-213 and the Manfrotto 055XPROB.  Price was about the same but I was a little put off by some of the reviews of the 055XPROB talking about plastic parts breaking.  I liked hat the Induro came with warmers on all three legs (I shot in bad weather a lot) and that it came with a bag.  Additionally, I really liked the hook on the bottom of the center column I used the one on my Dolica constantly.  I ordered the Induro and have been very happy.Along with the legs you get a bag for the legs and a small accessory bag with wrenches and the spikes.  The spikes are quite substantial and should last a long time.  I may order a second set now in case they wear out after this model is discontinued.  The bag for the legs is a nice, basic bag with a padded handle and padded strap.  The legs themselves have a nice heft to them.  They feel strong and so far have been strong.  And I am really glad the legs have warmers.  I shot for about an hour in the cold recently and the legs stayed cold for almost the same length of time once I was back inside - a good indication of the thickness of the legs.I matted mine with a Manfrotto 498RC2 Ball Head (which I love).  Together they make a great tripod but they also create the only negative I have.  I am 5' 6\"\" and between the legs, the ball head and my K200 with battery grip, I have to stand on my toes to see through the view finder - and that is with the center column down!  On the positive side, with the column up and only the small legs extended, my camera sits at about chest level which is where I like to shoot a lot of the time.  Having only two sections makes the AT-213 more sturdy and solid but the three section 055X is more flexible.  Of course being two inches taller would solve the issue too!!Overall a GREAt piece of gear and at a very nice price.\"", "Converting from Manfrotto, had very high expectations for this, purchased with an Induro BHL series ball head. On receipt of this it went right to work on assignment, all good, height was perfect, center collar requires a good tighten to keep from having too much play, and one of the lower leg extensions required a good pull to fully extend. I just thought it was new and that it would work itself out. It has in fact gotten worse. No response from Induro,(aarrgh). Still sticking, keep you posted for final outcome.", "I needed a tripod that was up to the task of supporting my 150500mm Sigma lens.  I placed an Opteka gimbal head on it (Opteka GH1 Heavy Gimbal Supportsand this combo works great.Induro seems to have budget pricing, but their tripods are built really well.HIGHLY recommended.", "I had a hard time spending the extra for carbon fiber and i'm glad I didn't. If you work with a tripod everyday than by all means get the carbon fiber. That extra pound will pay for itself over the long run. But for someone like me who uses it 4 times a month, this is perfect. The quality is outstanding, and I really feel this is one of the great bargain tripods out there. Rock solid and not too heavy. Perfect for landscapes! Yes there are better tripods by far, but not in this price range.", "\"I'm reviewing the AT-213 Tripod along with the BHD2 Ballhead because I bought both, and they're intended to be used together.  Not that you couldn't use a different ballhead with the AT-213, or different tripod with the BHD2.  But they look \"\"right\"\" together, and there's definitely no point mixing and matching the Induro equipment.  If your camera requirements are driving you towards the BHD3, you really need the matching AT-313 tripod to go with it.  I have a Nikon D7000, and my biggest lens is the Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5 VR, which sits rock solid on this pairing.I use this primarily outdoors, which at the moment means very cold and very windy.  While shooting three-shot brackets for HDR processing, this system holds everything steady, and I can't detect any movement between the exposures.  The tripod sets up easily and quickly, and once you lock the legs, they stay locked.  It has a level, but I don't bother with it, I just get the tripod on the most stable spot I can find and adjust the ball to level the camera.  The upper legs have a foam wrapping, which your hands will appreciate if you carry this thing around outside in freezing weather.My old tripod had a panhead, and I wasn't sure I'd like a ballhead.  After about an hour I not only got used to it, but came to prefer it over a panhead.  It comes with an Arca-Swiss compatible plate, and my Kirk l-bracket fits it just fine.  The plate's \"\"quick release clamp\"\" is a screw-type clamp, and not nearly as quick as some other heads out there, but it works for me.The only downside of this equipment is that it's heavy.  I seldom carry it very far so it's not an issue, but for long hikes, you probably need to spent the big bucks and get a carbon fiber rig.  The only reason I would even consider replacing this would be if I got a big telephoto lens, and in that case I'd probably upgrade to the larger Induro equipment.  Overall, I really like it.\"", "As expected, this is a big, solid, quality tripod.  It likes to stay exactly where you put it, exactly as you'd like.  Zero vibration, even without a sandbag attached.  The only practical downside of course is that it's big - too big to fit in any normal suitcase, for example, so it had to get left at home on a recent trip.  It comes with its own travel bag, which is quite handy otherwise.Contrary to some reviews I read around the interwebs, the travel bag does have plenty of extra space to allow for whatever head you attach (excepting, perhaps, large gimbal heads).  For example, I use the Vanguard SBH-250 ball head and it all fits together and into the bag with plenty of room to spare."], "Gamma": [0.3895825445652008, 0.38955581188201904, 0.22086165845394135], "Beta": [[0.003958425018936396, 0.00017805151583161205, 0.01026620902121067, 0.0005788317648693919, 0.0006544283241964877, 0.17097517848014832, 0.33538058400154114, 0.0001989978045457974, 0.012301177717745304, 0.006383406929671764, 0.025264572352170944, 0.0005059620598331094, 0.4333542585372925], [0.003958259709179401, 0.0001780753373168409, 0.010266868397593498, 0.0005789014976471663, 0.0006544812931679189, 0.17097356915473938, 0.33538612723350525, 0.00019898911705240607, 0.012300754897296429, 0.006383198779076338, 0.025263333693146706, 0.0005059378454461694, 0.43335145711898804], [0.005819009151309729, 4.915786121273413e-05, 0.0055062309838831425, 0.00018169764371123165, 0.0002983359736390412, 0.18465150892734528, 0.2829398810863495, 0.0002969340712297708, 0.016816245391964912, 0.008571134880185127, 0.03976105526089668, 0.000785368902143091, 0.4543234407901764]]}
