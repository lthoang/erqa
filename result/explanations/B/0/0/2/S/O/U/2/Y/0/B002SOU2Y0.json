Even though they're refurbished they sound great! I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD 595s, and while they're not going to sound as good as those, they're really really nice for a pair of wireless headphones. The range is pretty good, definitely won't get 60 feet if you're going through walls and stuff, but since I just use them for watching movies and shows, I'm pretty close to the receiver already. I'd say you can get about 30-40 feet of range if the transmitter has to go through walls/floors of a house. To comment on the reviewers who mention an audible hiss while having these on, I can hear it to but only when there is no sound during the movie/show. Once the action or dialogue starts up, it's like the sound never existed. Battery life on them is great as well. I make sure to keep them charged, but even so I've gone through watching 5 James Bond films and the batteries never died. Since these don't offer the wireless charging station, I though I'd miss out on that feature but I really don't since I tend to only charge them one a week at the most. Just plug it in after watching it and leave it until the next day. Haven't taken them out on a mobile adventure, so I really can't comment on how the mobility of the whole setup is, but I really just wanted it for movies and shows. Great pair of headphone, highly recommended.", "I've owned a lot of different head phones in the past years, but this set is extremely great.I was a bit concerned about being Bluetooth, which usually has an audio delay, but it's so slight, you don't notice it.  They stay on frequency and cup the ears nicely, very comfortable.", "My wife has trouble hearing dialog on the TV clearly. Our purpose with this purchase was to replace a set of TV Ears that were uncomfortable for her to wear and that required infrared to work. This Sennheiser headset fills this purpose beyond our expectations!Without going into a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, this device is easy to set up and sounds great. Even better, it works independently of the TV sound. I can turn the volume up or down on the TV without affecting the volume in the headphones. They are lightweight, comfortable to wear, sound great and are easy to use.This headphone uses rechargeable batteries located in each earpiece. (The batteries are provided in the box.) The ear pad turns counterclockwise to remove it and reveal the battery location. When they stop being functional, which based on my experience with rechargeable batteries will be a very long time, they can be easily and inexpensively replaced.The other thing I really appreciate is that these headphones use a technology called Kleer, which at the time of purchase I was unfamiliar with. They do not use or need infrared. That means they work perfectly in our entertainment center, even with the glass door closed! That's a major improvement over TV Ears.I can't speak to how the sound compares to, say, Beats, but for our purpose, which was to allow my wife to listen to the TV clearly, they score 100%. Highly recommended.", "Very nice high quality earphones ... Nice for watching tv in bed when spouse wants to sleep. I would buy them again.", "I have all of these, the 160, 170, 180's and the MX W1 earbuds.These Work great! Got them paired with the 170's base unit. I can NOT tell the difference in quality between this headset and the 170's. These will also have BASS and Surround when paired to the 170's base~!!!On another note, When paired to the same base unit, ALL the headset volumes will be effected when changing the volume on any headset EXCEPT these. These work independently and if you're using multiple units paired to the same base, these are the ones you MUST HAVE. A BEST BUY.", "I have bought about five different wireless sets and returned each. This one is the real deal. It's a snap to set up, and the sound is crystal clear. No dial to tune, no fiddling with switches. Just turn it on, it finds the round transmitter's signal (the transmitter attaches via red/white RCA cables to the AUDIO OUT ports in the back of your TV or tuner/receiver), and I'm listening in bed while my wife sleeps. Sony makes a good one, but Sennheiser, a company that makes high-end stereo components, has them beat in this department.", "Unfortunately, none of the digital headphone systems will allow you to watch TV with your loved ones. All the digital headphones I have tested (Sennheiser, Oticon Streamer, etc.) induce a delay that creates a echo effect when you are listening to sources that also have speakers going. If you have the sound on the TV or stereo turned up loud enough for your girl friend/wife/kids to hear you are going to hear an echo that makes it impossible for you to listen and enjoy.I am using a Sennheiser analog headphone systemSennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphonesand it works perfectly, no delay so I can enjoy my evening TV with my wife. It may not have the high quality of the digital systems, but it has enhanced my quality time with my family.", "These sound great but in my house, they only work line-of-sight, so I'm returning them. I read other reviews that said these could be used all around the house and even outdoors but that hasn't been my experience. I put the base in my 2nd floor office connected to my computer and I listen mostly to music and a few loud video games. But when I walk into the next room which is only a distance of about 10 feet away thru an open doorway, the sound cuts out completely. I repeated this short walk/experiment many times but it always cuts out. And as I go further through the house, there seem to be only a few good spots where the signal comes in strongly. I live in an old center hall colonial and from end to end, it is only about 40 feet long so you can never be further than 40 feet away. Sennheiser claims these should maintain a clear signal for 60 feet (and I assume that is thru walls and ceilings, who has a 60 foot long room in their house?) and I think I've read other people's reviews where they are getting a good signal up to 200 feet away. I know I have a lot of wirelessness going on in my office as my wireless router is located there and maybe is causing the drop-outs. I use my router for many things: DirecTV internet, PS3, 4 computers, 4 phones, 2 MagicJack+, SlingBox, HD backups, and a printer. I know my MagicJack for the phone keeps giving me strange beeps so maybe I just have too much going on in that room.In response to this limited range, I bought the RS 170s and they actually have a much better range and better bass (when the bass button is activated). However, I actually prefer the smaller, portable base of the 160's but I'm still testing the 170s and they seem like keepers. If only the 170's included a small portable base as well as the little recharge tower that they come with.", "These are great wireless headphones from sennheiserPros:1-Sound quality is amazing for a wireless headphone. It beats the sound quality on some wired headphones. The bass is very powerful for a sennheiser product. The highs are also very crisp.2- These headphones are very comfortable. they don't sqeaze my head like most other headphones do. also there are tons of padding for your head and ears.3- range is pretty good. You can walk around the house and still have perfect reception. you may not receive good reception if you take the headphones outside.4-the controls on the headphone are nice even though they are sometimes a little hard to use.5-the transmitter runs off of A/C power or batteries which make it versatile. Also there is an additional volume control on it. this may be confusing at first but it became handy for me. I use my headphones with my A/V receiver when i don't want the speakers playing. i like to leave my receiver on one general volume for the speakers (which is high) while the headphone i like on low. the volume knob on the headphone's transmitter lets me adjust the volume externally so i can leave my just receiver on high and yet have lower volume coming in to my headphones.Cons:the headphones do not automatically shut off when they are hooked up to an A/V receiver after not being used for a while even after the AV receiver is no longer on. This means if i forget to turn it off the headphones i waste battery since it stays on all day. Also the buttons on the headphones could be a little easier to used.Overall:Usually using a wireless headphone means you have to sacrifice sound but not with these. these are not only good sounding but also comfortable. They are also very thoughtfully made for the most part so i have to recommend these.Tip: buy better/extra rechargeable batteries. This way when you run out of charge you can just swap out the batteries with fresh one and quickly resume what you were doing.", "Purchased to compliment the new HDTV in my bedroom. Ideal for watching movies at night. Wireless is a Godsend. Very clear sound, very happy.My one complaint: Sennheiser includes a stand with the 170 & 180 models but not this one, the 160. Feels like a cheap move on their part. You will need a stand of some sort in my opinion. Otherwise looks cheap just laying them on a table. I ended up buying a banana stand from a local retailer and they hang from there. I think Sennheiser should have included some sort of stand. Even if it was made of cheap materials.I also recommend you purchase a set of 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and a charger. You get 2 rechargeable batteries with the headphones. It's a pain to charge the batteries using the headphones and adapter. Just buy stand alone batteries and life will be a lot easier when you run out of juice (keep 2 AAA batteries charged as a backup at all times).", "Soooo many wrong info in the bad posts, one even by a guy that admits he never even tried these great headphones. I got mine 2 months ago and have used extensively and can tell you the following:Wireless RF and certainly NOT IR! Means you can go say 50 feet from the base unit in any direction, and still get signal. Headphone battery strength and transmitter battery strength will affect distance. As most typically never leave the room, these are outstanding. 10 out of 10.Battery life in the headphones is pretty outstanding I think. I fall asleep and the phones are on for hours when I shut off and the next night they are still ready to go for another flick. I'd rate 8.5 out of 10.They are comfortable and cover the ear. When sitting listening, never got hot. Exercising tho yes, ears get hot. 9 out of 10 for comfort.The limitation this has is you cannot 'crank it up' without overdriving the transmitter to distortion. The flashing green power on LED turns red when overloaded. I would personally like to be able to turn the phones louder, but it is probably best not to as at top volume they are loud enough easily. 7 out of 10The sound quality itself is outstanding, especially with a good headphone amp. Bass is not overpowering but is to me, substantial. Perfect to lose yourself in a movie. Music is pretty sweet also, tho mainly these are used at night when the kids are asleep. 10 out of 10I would easily recommend these to anyone that doesn't want to be tethered down to a cord. These go on road trips for the kids. Add another headset and they both watch the DVDs and mom and I can talk. Perfect! As a whole I rate 8.5 out of 10 since for the money this is the best out there for what it is.", "I got those headphones as a replacement to my RS120.As the 120 are not digital you may have interference which those have not (being digital and all) so that is a definitive plus.Unboxing I was a little dissapointed to not find a RCA to headphone converter. I use them mainly for TV watching and my TV does not have a headphone jack, only standard (red/white) stereo out etc. So had to run and get one, no big deal but would have loved of they were included.Since those are also built for mobile devices i.e. you can carry the sender pod around if you put batteries in it, I understand that it does not have a charging cradle like the 120's. Still having to plug in the charging cable into the headphones is a little annoying.Last gripe, they turning on process. There were times where I turned them on not how Sennheiser thinks I should and they apparently got annoyed and did not play. You pretty much 'have to' turn on base first and then the headphones, each with a 1s press. Little odd, but no deal-breaker.The sound is awesome. Not too bass-heavy like some other overpriced brands. They sound just right, especially for TV.Small think I like is that volume controls etc are at the bottom and not the back (like on the 120's) which could be pushed accidentally brushing by the couch etc.Overall a great set - very loud if you want them to be.", "My title pretty much sums up these headphones.  I was hoping for better but, once you even crank a bit of volume it's cracking so bad my eardrums could pop.  The hiss is relentless.  After about 20 minutes of wearing these my ears are sweating - and I don't sweat easily.  Range, about as good as the sound quality.  I'm going to take these back and try the 180's.  We shall see how those perform.", "These are some good headphones, but the common issues still exist. Those being wireless interference (get some static, or just completely cut off if you go too far away. By too far I mean one room away). Also the battery drain is pretty bad. I've had this for a few months, and after a few uses, had to change batteries multiple times. I would suggest rechargeable in this case, if you plan on using them a lot. However, they are comfortable, clear sound when close and noise cancel pretty well. I would recommend the for sure, as other wireless ones I've used also had this issues, if not worse!", "I don't know how Customer Service is because I've never needed them in the months I've owned this, but I'm very happy with this purchase.  The sound is amazing for wireless headphones and the range is really good.  Not only do I get clear reception in every room of my apartment, but I can also leave my apartment entirely with the door shut behind me and walk all the way down the hallway and then make a right towards the laundry room before the reception cuts out.  I like them so much I was also hoping I could find this exact thing except with speakers instead of headphones, so I can hook it t my phone every night in my bathroom and keep the speakers in my bedroom.- That way instead of just shutting off the alarm in the morning and drifting back to sleep, I'm forced to get up and go to the bathroom to shut the alarm off- the idea being I'd likely start brushing my teeth, etc at the sink rather than fall back to bed.  Unfortunately they don't seem to make a speaker version of this product and wireless speakers I have tried so far have very poor reception compared to these excellent headphones."], "Gamma":
