"], "reviews": ["I've been using this product daily for over a month, and overall I really like the way it makes my skin look. It's a great moisturizer, and the shimmery gold glitter component really does give my skin a nice, youthful glow. Not only is the product nice, but I love the bottle it comes in; the eyedropper-style dispenser lets me get just how much I want with no waste, which is important when every drop is this expensive.Though I do really like the way I look when I use this serum, I'm disappointed that it doesn't seem to have made any kind of permanent improvements to my skin... my wrinkles are still here, in all their glory. For the price, I'd like to have seen some better results. Bottom line: a pretty cosmetic, but way too pricey for something that can't deliver even a few tiny miracles.", "First of all, I've never tried any anti-wrinkle product before, but when given the opportunity to give the Fytofontana Cosmeceutical Botoceutical  (good luck spell-checking that) Gold Anti Wrinkle Biotechnology Serum for Adult Skin Over 43, a whirl, me and my over 45 skin gladly dove in.With its normal $139 price tag, it's not something I'd normally consider, but I've been looking notably craggier around the eyes and forehead lately, so I figured what the heck.The product, attractively packaged in a 1.05 fluid once glass bottle is applied with a glass pipette which dispenses the recommended single drop of shimmering, golden liquid which you spread around your fingers, then apply to the areas on your face you feel need the most attention.It's goes on smoothly and doesn't leave any telltale residue.  It's got a very light fragrance and, most important for my sensitive skin, I haven't developed any reactions or felt any irritation thus far.The Swiss manufacturer claims an 85.6% reduction in wrinkles in volunteer tests after just 28 days of twice-daily use.I've only been using it a week, and, while it could be the psychological boost of spreading something gold on your face that comes out of an expensive-looking bottle, I do seem to notice--and feel--more of a smoothness around my eyes and, especially the area of my forehead above the bridge of my nose, so time will tell (and, ideally, not tell, where my skin's true age is concerned!).", "\"I really liked the way the fluid felt on my skin.  It spread easily and absorbed quickly.  The gold flecks were very subtle and produced a nice \"\"glow\"\" effect for a few hours each day.  My 47 year old skin can be a little sensitive but this serum did not irritate it in any way.  Although I've really enjoyed the product for its moisturizing and its skin feel, it did not reduce my wrinkles or fine lines at all.  Given the high price, I will not repurchase.\"", "I want to qualify this review by saying that I received this item for free to test and then review as part of the Vine program.  The reason I say that is that I would never be able to afford the $130 price tag otherwise.  I have faithfully used this product daily for a month according to the directions and honestly don't notice any significant difference.  From what I understand, it's supposed to work sort of like temporary Botox, relaxing your skin so that wrinkles appear less noticeable.  I have concentrated on the area around my eyes which is where my wrinkles are most visible.  After a month of use, that area looks pretty much the same as before.  No one has noticed any difference in my skin at all.  It's a slightly sticky golden colored liquid which you dab lightly over areas of concern on your face.  It dries pretty quickly and then you apply your normal moisturizer and makeup over it.  It wasn't unpleasant to use at all.  In fact, it has a cooling sensation right after applying which is nice.  But, I can use cheap drugstore eye creams and get a nice cooling sensation.  I am not a person who normally goes in for pricey cosmetics so this was definitely a novelty for me and it just didn't live up to expectation or even to its description claims.  I really enjoyed getting the chance to give it a try but sorry I can't recommend it.", "\"This serum - a medium I have not tried before - is especially formulated, apparently, for skin over 45 years old. My skin certainly falls into that bracket, and is beginning to plague me with the ravages of time, so I decided to give it a try. It specifically says \"\"for the face\"\" but my arms also are depressing, so I use it primarily on them, and I have to say, with diligent use there is a difference. Nothing short of a regeneration machine would completely solve the problem, but if you want to be at least temporarily mollified about the appearance of your skin, this stuff does help. (It should, for its price.) One must maintain a daily regimen, however, to get any even semi-lasting results, and this is my failing - I am not always as faithful in application as I should be. The gold apparent in the content makes you feel a lttle more decadent, also.\"", "Botoceutical Gold is a new product from Switzerland that is being directed to people over age 45 to help minimize the fine wrinkles that appear with skin changes associated with age.  It contains hexapeptide, pentapeptide, octapeptide and dipeptide, hyaluronic acid, lipoic acid, retinol, anti-oxidants, and other inert ingredients.  Allied to the thin skin at the lateral areas to the eyes  - those areas where laugh lines are particularly noticeable - twice a day, this substance is lightly applied and then patted in to the skin for complete absorption. It is rather amazing how rapidly the solution evens out the skin, reducing the depth of the fine wrinkles: in only a few days of use the change is noticeable.Probably this topical solution with never match the results gained by injectable botulinum toxin in those areas, but it is an alternative to attempt before seeking Botox injections. There do not seem to be side effects when used properly so the only deterrent to trying it is the rather high cost of the solution - not as high as Botox injections, but still on the higher end of the scale of cosmeceuticals.  Grady Harp, October 12", "When collagen breaks down, peptides are released into the dermis.  Peptides signal the dermal system to produce more collagen.  This product, with four peptides, seems promising at first glance.  After all, if we can improve collagen production, we're protecting the structure of our skin.There are many products that contain peptides on the market.  Fytofontana promises results because this product contains not only a variety of peptides, but several other ingredients, like retinol, sodium hyaluronate, and phospholipids.  Beyond these considerations, there are a number of shortcomings to consider.The first problem is dispensing the product.  The cap must be pumped and removed so you can dispense the product from a pipette.  Two problems here:  What if you knock over the bottle and spill the product?  And the bottle is not opaque.  Exposure to air and light diminish the efficacy of retinol.Second, this product contains a lot of fragrance in the form of perfume and essential oils.  This will certainly cause problems for many users, experienced as irritation or allergic reaction.Because there are many serums available that do contain peptides and the other beneficial ingredients mentioned that have opaque, airtight packaging, I do not recommend this serum.  I have used it for several weeks with no improvement in the appearance of my skin.  This could have been a contender, but it isn't.", "At 1st this packaging was a little confusing. The frosted jar is attractive and I looked at the leaflet inserted but it was not clear on how to apply the lotion. So I thought it was a pump action to prime it 1st. Wrong. After a couple of minutes I realized you twist off the white top and it is a dropper applicator inside. It's a golden color serum that you sparingly apply over your just cleaned and dry face without any other product applied in advance. You dispence from the dropper to your fingertip and dot on the areas around your face and then gently blend until  it absorbs. It dries fast and blends well and I was surprised at how well it feels afterwards-smooth and not sticky. Then once it's fully dry then you can follow with your favorite moisturizer. I've only had this for a few days but I've noticed a slight improvement in my skin. A little softening in some fine lines, but it might take a while if it is to do anything w/the deep lines. But when I use this at night and follow with my alpha hydroxy night cream I wake up in the am with no greasy feeling like I did before I started using this. I'm going to wait until the bottom of the jar to see how my skin looks then. I don't have any sun damage so I'm curious how this would work on skin that is damaged in that manner.", "I religiously used it twice a day for several months after reading all the promises of amazing results after 28 days of use. I so wanted to believe the hype. The list of ingredients and science behind it was impressive. But alas, this serum did not produce any results. No wrinkle reduction. No texture change. No change in skin pigmentation / eveness or tone. . Maybe I just wanted to believe. My skin does feel a little softer, though.", "\"I'm 45 and, although I don't have any deep wrinkles, I do have fine lines around my eyes and am beginning to get them around my mouth. My neck and decolletage, however, are another story altogether. I have 'necklace' wrinkles and have begun to see collagen breakdown on my upper chest that will eventually become deep wrinkles. Ew. Needless to say, I've spent a small fortune in search of products, both OTC and prescription, to address these areas.Since I had the chance to try this for free via Amazon's Vine program, but really didn't expect much. Still, I was very impressed with how silky my skin felt the first time I applied it before bedtime. The next morning, my skin looked more radiant than it has in quite some time. Two more uses (one morning, one at night), and I saw a definite improvement in plumpness. Some of the finer lines under my eyes aren't as noticeable, and my skin just looks all-around more hydrated.I really like the way this definitely sinks into my skin a few moments after application. I follow it with SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g (my favorite face product EVER!) and my skin looks better than it did in my 20's!One thing to note: this has a marked fragrance which I happen to think smells amazing, but if you're sensitive to such things you should know this is NOT unscented. Oh, and I don't know if I like the pipette applicator or not. It seems to create to many opportunities for cross-contamination. It does administer the \"\"small drop\"\" you need (really, that's all you need -- this stuff glides right on) but a pump would work just as well, I think.All in all, I'm very impressed with this product.\"", "I am a woman in her mid-50's and am very, very savy about skin care products.  I have run the gamut of everything from over-the-counter bargain stuff, to some of the more expensive brands available at Macy's, Sephora, and Nordstroms. I am no stranger to Strivectin (a waste of money), Botox or Juvederm.This is a very silky, golden color, fast-absorbing serum that I have used twice a day for the past 3 weeks (the paperwork says that you should see results in a few days and definitely after 30).  I give my skin a thorough cleaning and then apply the liquid all over my face - a little does go very, very far.There has been no adverse reactions (redness, blemishes, burning) whatsoever and it does feel very lovely going on, in addition to having an extremely pleasant scent that doesn't smell like chemicals. It dries very quickly and I apply my Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Creme right over it.  I don't use liquid make-up, I prefer to use tinted moisturizer during the day, and also have applied this right over the serum with no adverse interactions.My disappointment is that I have failed to see any significant results that would warrent going out and spending $140.00 on another bottle. My skin looks healthy but it normally does, and I don't feel that there has been any change for the better that is apparent. It hasn't performed negatively, but as for being anti-wrinkle I just don't see it. And, yes I do have wrinkles.I will continue to follow the routine of using this serum until it is completely empty - which will likely be for quite a while. And I will continue to closely monitor any changes. Hopefully I will be plesantly surprised in the future, and will be able to update this review with some terrific results. But not at this time.", "\"Although I have only been using this product for a few weeks, I have noticed a difference in my skin. The serum seems to have softened the appearance of some of my lines and wrinkles, especially on my cheeks. I am impressed with the generous size of the bottle, and, as a little goes a long way, I expect that it will last for quite a while. Prior to applying the serum, I wash my face thoroughly, let my skin dry, and then apply a small amount of the product to my face, especially on my cheeks and around my mouth. After it dries, I apply my usual moisturizer. If I use it during the day, I use it with a face cream with at least a 15 spf. One reviewer said it was not for skin that broke out or became red from products -- I have found it to be totally non-irritating, and I sometimes react badly to skin products that are \"\"too strong.\"\" The only thing I can add in that regard is that if you have had issues in the past you may want to use less of the product to start, and contact your doctor if you have an adverse reaction. But I have experienced nothing but good results. The only thing that might keep me from using the serum again (after I run out of this bottle) would be the price.UPDATE: I have been using this product 2-3 times a week since I wrote my review so that it will last longer. There has been an improvement in my skin as noted in the original review, but there has also not been a total transformation. The only thing that can result in a total transformation is expensive surgery or an expensive, temporary injectable. Due to genetics and long exposure to the sun as a child and a teen, my skin weathered prematurely, and the best I can hope for in the long run is to soften the appearance of the damage. This product, combined with a sunblocking face cream, is a good choice. And it is still non-irratating on my skin after several months.\"", "It's very easy to apply, very easy to smooth on my face.  I love the scent!  I looked forward to using it every day.  The scent is very light and reminds me of citrus.  Very fresh smelling.The applicator is nice.  I dislike creams where I have to dip my hands in a jar to get the product out.  I feel like I am introducing germs in the product every time I do that.  And I have long nails so it's impossible to get the product on my fingers without it getting under my nails.  This item has a pump that allows me to squeeze the serum onto my fingers.  Brilliant!It might be the color of my skin, but I didn't notice any 'gold' color when I applied this.  My skin soaked it up but I noticed later in the day my skin seemed to be a bit more shiny and oily looking.  I have oily skin anyway, so the fact that this made my skin look even more oily wasn't a mark in it's favor.I'm at the end of the bottle now and I just don't really see any difference to any wrinkles.  I really wanted this product to work but it seems to just be a nice cream for my face.  My little wrinkles are still there.  Little buggers.", "I've never spent $139..00 on any skin care product, so I jumped at the offer as I am a Vine reviewer, to see if this was really worth the bang for it's buck.  I am 50, I have youthful skin, so I tried it on my face, decolletage, & hands.  It absorbed quickly, has a lovely scent, so if you are fragrance sensitive you may not like this. It is shimmery, but I don't notice any crazy glow on my skin and as far as reducing wrinkle, like I said my 50 yr old skin looks pretty fabulous, as most folks think I am 40 & gasp when I share my age.  I prefer to drink lots of water, take my vitamins, eat well and use caution around sun exposure & my dermatologist told me at 13, the benefit of having oily skin was that I would stay looking younger longer than most.  So I can't say if this product really reduces wrinkles or not.  But it is lovely!", "I have been using Fytofontana Cosmeceutical Botoceutical Gold Anti-Wrinkle Serum for 2 months so to give this product enough time to prove its effectiveness. Needless to say, I am not convinced that this product is effective as there are no visible changes on my face. That said, it does give my face a certain glow, which my husband noticed immediately. The bottom line is... for $140 you would expect this product to deliver its promises but it does not, which is very disappointing. I was especially optimistic. Nonetheless, I will stick to my $25 anti-wrinkle product, which proved more effective.", "My first thought on seeing the extreme cost of this product was that if it really worked as advertised, some of the celebrities and politicians and their wives would certainly be using it and the results showing. The next was, after looking at the ingredient list the first and main ingredient is aqua? Water?It did have an instruction sheet saying to apply a drop to your finger tips and apply to clean skin prior to using any cosmetics, and then wait a few minutes. It can be used around the eyes, but keep out of the eyes, so one must be careful about touching your face and then rubbing your eyes. When using this, my skin felt sticky even hours afterwards. I did use it for the full time needed. It says to use for 28 days, twice daily. Those directions were on the advertising page, but not in the package - an extremely strange and critical omission. The dropper is a bit awkward to use and the fact that the bottle is thick glass is a bit unnerving to use in a bathroom setting for potential dropping and breakage.It is manufactured in Switzerland and an address for that country and the distribution center in the US and a web site and e mail were given. Good to know that you can get ahold of them. The booklet included shows pictures of the results. The problem with this is that the before were all much darker, so that skews the results of the photos.The bottom line is that personally I saw no difference and I guess because I was studying my wrinkles, it actually looked like there were more of them and they seemed more noticeable to me.", "I have dry, somewhat sensitive skin, even more dry as the weather gets colder. I've been using this 3 weeks on my face, neck, and around my eyes in the crows feet area, along with my normal moisturizer and SPF as this alone isn't enough moisture for me. At first this serum caused me to itch, but I kept up and eventually my skin got accustomed to it.The serum has good ingredients, but it also has 5 parabens (parabens don't bother me personally, but you may choose to not want any in your skincare regimen - they are used as a preservative - see below). The tin oxides impart a glow to your face, like tiny specks of glitter, which I don't care for, especially if you're over 45 which is the targeted age range of this product (I'm barely in the range, and I don't need glitter on my face! If you put something over this such as tinted moisturizer or foundation, it will knock the glow down to being acceptable.The serum comes in an eye-dropper style bottle, and you press the button on top of the cap to dispense more serum into the dropper. It takes only a drop or 2 for your entire face, soaks in quickly, and is not greasy or sticky. It has a pleasant light, fruity/floral scent that quickly dissipates.Of course, it takes awhile to assess whether this has any wrinkle-reducing ability - as far as dramatic wrinkle reduction, I will update my review after the 28 days is up; I don't foresee much difference as I've used skincare with peptides for several years.So far, I'm not blown away by this serum. I can get peptides in other much less expensive serums; however, I'm not sure of the concentration (what percentage) the Fytofontana has in it.NOTE: Some studies have shown that parabens MAY cause some types of cancer. I'm not sure if I believe this, but it's out there for you to Google and read.This line is made by: Herb-pharma AG Schweiz located in Zurich, Switzerland"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.061786867678165436, 0.05237047001719475, 0.05781135335564613, 0.06852777302265167, 0.060754306614398956, 0.06890157610177994, 0.058345336467027664, 0.04144100472331047, 0.05938214063644409, 0.04098702594637871, 0.06182355061173439, 0.0603100024163723, 0.061283569782972336, 0.06592264026403427, 0.06546495854854584, 0.058773066848516464, 0.05611436441540718]]}
