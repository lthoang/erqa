I bought this to use as a stereo hookup for my iPod or computer. It's not very flexible and it is rather stiff, which makes it difficult to adjust and maneuver. That being said, if you were to use it where this rigidity and sturdiness would be of benefit to you, this is the perfect product. However, if you plan on using this for an application where the flexibility and movement of a thinner cord would be better, try buying a different product instead.I would recommend this product, but only for applications where it would be stationary. Blessings!", "this a nice high quality cable. i have nothing negative to say about it. i wouldn't hesitate to purchase, this is a fantastic value...", "Fast shipping and high quality cable. Worth the money. Hooked up to a flat screen to play through the house stereo. Worked like a champion.", "Though the double wire ran the whole length of the cable it is well worth the price. These cables replaced another and cheap set that left a hum in my speakers. No more hum with this cable!", "Very good quality cables, especially for this price - I was actually surprised with the build quality - much better than expected.", "This arrived a day ahead of time, which was a plus. Overall, the cable seems like a good, sturdy cable that should last for quite a while. The RCA heads grip firmly.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that it's rather bulky. If your installation doesn't have very much room, I would go for a different cable. However, if you have room to spare, I would certainly recommend this!", "\"What I use it for:- Connecting a mixer's \"\"tape out\"\" to a computer's \"\"line-in\"\"- Connecting a computer's line-out to a receiver's inputsPros:- Shielded to reduce interference--good for recording- Minimal noise- Gold-plated connectorsCon:- Plug is bulky. If jacks are close together, they might not fit in adjacent jacks.\"", "Nice cable, sturdy, firm connections. Audio quality is great. I use it to connect my Mac Pro to my desktop monitors at work. IT does the job great and I have no complaints. Excellent cables.", "We have an older surround sound that doesn't have a hookup for an iPod. I bought this cable and now we can listen to our music or Pandora on our surround sound. I was considering buying a new surround sound even though ours is amazing, simply because I couldn't hook up my iPod to it. This cable was a LOT cheaper. :) A great product.", "I don't know why but I could not find any of these cables at the local home improvement stores or dollar stores where you could always get these before. Anyway I am glad I couldn't find one locally because this is a nice well-made cable. Most of these are thin wire that could easily be broken if bent, I bet this cable will last me a lifetime.", "The metal jackets or sleeves on the RCA ends are too tightly spaced making it impossible to attach the cables to an amp without damaging the amp.I tried to gently bend the sleeve tangs with pliers to open them up a bit. The sleeves on the RCA ends on these cables are made of an overly thick & brittle cast metal.  Cast metal does not like to bend. As a result several of the tangs broke off completely.The insulation that encloses the wires makes it seem like the wire should thicker than 22 gauge (.025 inch / .64 mm, the thickness of mechanical pencil lead). It looks impressive but is very misleading and unnecessarily cumbersome.Not worth the time or effort. I recommend Media Bridge as they make better products.", "Better then expected.... the quality of the product was very good.  A lot bigger gage wire.... I was surprised for the money  I paid.Thank You!", "I can't speak for it's quality since I got it just for subwoofers, but they work and look nice. Not much to say.", "I purchased a $3 cable and it broke after a week or two. I have been looking for a good quality cable for my iphone in my car and I was finding a lot of $10+ cables until I stumbled on this one. THIS CABLE IS THICK. I have only used this for about a month now but I don't see this cable going bad. It is VERY sturdy. Some might say it's too thick but I love it.The only down side is that I have to remove my iPhone case to use it. Other then that I love it."], "Gamma": [0.2164478749036789, 0.195359468460083, 0.196067214012146, 0.19606272876262665, 0.19606272876262665], "Beta": [[0.0028806712944060564, 0.15136155486106873, 0.0003186143876519054, 0.0514083057641983, 0.12084397673606873, 0.18223965167999268, 0.03690432757139206, 0.12213445454835892, 0.005732563324272633, 0.006721326150000095, 0.0008030646713450551, 0.13983650505542755, 0.17756566405296326, 0.0012492609675973654], [0.0027643826324492693, 0.15073467791080475, 0.0004233245272189379, 0.05322599411010742, 0.12015482038259506, 0.18264466524124146, 0.03616133704781532, 0.12221018970012665, 0.0057212552055716515, 0.006217733956873417, 0.0007860402693040669, 0.13959307968616486, 0.1777685284614563, 0.0015940353041514754], [0.002980622462928295, 0.151015505194664, 0.00030841692932881415, 0.052786290645599365, 0.12080713361501694, 0.1815738081932068, 0.037304528057575226, 0.12219163030385971, 0.005663041956722736, 0.006567877251654863, 0.0008000268717296422, 0.13969182968139648, 0.17709994316101074, 0.0012093951227143407], [0.0029806457459926605, 0.15101538598537445, 0.00030841430998407304, 0.05278659611940384, 0.12080710381269455, 0.18157364428043365, 0.03730461746454239, 0.12219163775444031, 0.005663025192916393, 0.006567840930074453, 0.0008000253001227975, 0.1396917849779129, 0.17709988355636597, 0.0012093853438273072], [0.0029806471429765224, 0.15101541578769684, 0.00030841430998407304, 0.052786607295274734, 0.12080710381269455, 0.18157364428043365, 0.03730462118983269, 0.12219163775444031, 0.005663025192916393, 0.00656784325838089, 0.0008000253001227975, 0.1396917849779129, 0.17709988355636597, 0.00120938487816602]]}
