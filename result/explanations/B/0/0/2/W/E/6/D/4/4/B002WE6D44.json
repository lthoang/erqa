They love it and the storage is more than enough!", "I bought two of the Trascend 16GB SDHC Cards to replace some of my older PNY ones.The cards got stuck in each of my Nikon cameras and required manual prying with your fingernail to get out. Both cards had this problem, so I know it's not a completely isolated occurrence.", "I bought this for my new Canon S100 camera and it works great.  The camera takes up 12MP photos that can be close to or larger than 8 or 9MB in size.  It only takes about 2-4 seconds to save to the card.  At the highest resolution I can take close to 5000 photos and at 8MB I can fit about 10,000 photos on this card.  Can't be happier -- highly recommended.", "Unless you are a professional, I don't see why you would need anything faster than this card. It works very well, no complaints.", "Wasn't too sure about this brand, but was on a very tight budget and needed a fast card to work in a quick shooting camera. So far, the card works great.", "It has worked well in my Nikon Coolpix Camera. It doesn't sing, or dance, it remembers. So far, it is doing that very well and hopefully will continue to do so for a very long time.", "I've noticed a lot of people who've said write speeds are slow on this card. Keep in mind that a LOT of things affect write speeds. If you use a card reader built into a printer you will get slow speeds. If the card is close to full you will get slow speeds. If you have a cheap card reader IT might be the bottle neck.I recently purchased a USB 3 card reader, as my new motherboard has a couple of USB 3 ports. WRITE speeds for this card went through the roof. I downloaded a 4 gigabyte movie to the card, [keep in mind big files transfer faster] and it averaged 21 megabytes per second. That's twice the rated speed of the card. [Rating is based on minimum write speeds--Class 10 cards should give you no less the 10 MB/sec if there are no bottle necks.]The next movie I loaded was about the same size, but the card was nearly full and had had a lot of deletes, so the file was being scattered all over the card. Basically the equivalent of writing a lot of small files. The speed was about 11 MB/sec. This card provides great value. You just have to accept that there are technology limitations that are not in the card maker's control.", "Bought four of these recently to try with a Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS camera.  I was concerned that it wouldn't recognize the whole 8GB card, since the manual only showed it working to 512MB, but this card came through with flying colors.  There was no lag when taking pictures and it saving to the memory card either, even when holding down the picture button.  Great card for a great price!!", "I have had no issues with this card at all. The class 10 rating is perfect for my newer DLSR and will be purchasing this same brand again in the future.", "This item worked as needed. It was purchased for a friend and I haven't heard any excuses so that should be considered a good thing.", "This has worked well for me. I have not had any issues with the quality after using it for a few months. I am using it with an SD to CF adapter in my Canon 5D Mark II. I spent a little extra money to get the Transcend brand card because the reviews were noticeably better than some of the competitors, and I have used other cards from the same company without issue. Very happy with my purchase.", "This was purchased fr amazon's Black Fri sale for all up about AUD20 including shipping.Initially purchased for the Lumix LX5 which I was quite keen to acquire but have since dropped the idea. Am now using this as a backup for mum's new Canon Ixus 220 HS for high definition videoing which can now be liberally done without the nagging fear of rapidly running out of memory space.  I have read about some 32GB purchases which despite being class 10 were disappointing in access speed performance.  This I cant vouch or dispel at this stage as the card is currently 95% empty and it needs to fill up before the speed or lack of will manifest - nor do I have a comparison eg SanDisk equiv.  Will update this space so pl bear with me until all is clear.I picked the 16GB over the 32GB for the simple rationale being if anything goes wrong with the card, 2x16GB is better risk management than 1x32GB for data recovery.In summary, for simple usage - this card represents fantastic value for pixel warehousing.", "What else is there to say about a memory card? It works perfectly and holds quite a bit for a reasonable price. Worth the money.", "Good Memory card. I am using it in my flash camera. For me it holds to many pictures. I have had trouble at Walgreens picture machine and they told me that some times when you have so many pictures on a card  the machine doesn't work well it it. For me next time I will get a 4 or 8 GD card.  They work very good in my DCR-SX85 Sony Movie Camera", "Very good, I used it with 550d never had a problem, lost the card but bought 16gb and they work without problem.", "All this and performance has been great outperforms my sony card I have. I also read where turbo mode can make them fail if made too cheap but this has lasted so far.", "This was a gift I bought someone for Christmas. I believe it works perfect. It arrived pretty fast during the holiday craziness and it was new. All you can ask for. Well, other than it working and it has been thus far.", "Great card. Bought this for my camera. Processes at class ten speeds with little latency. Not as fast as other class ten cards I have tried, but works fine.", "I bought this card to use with my HD Hero helmet camera.  It works great so far and I have noticed no problems recording video or playing the video on my laptop (or connected to my HDTV)", "I cannot really say anything bad about this SD Card. It works. It simply does what it needs to do which is store data and fit into things that accept SD cards. The speeds of the card seem expected for a Class 10 card and they seem generally stable as well. The card looks nice and seems to be pretty well made. I'm currently using mine in my Raspberry Pi Model B and its working great so far.So if you are looking for a good SD Card that's Class 10 and affordable, then look no further!", "I really don't worked too much with it. I just needed a calss10 SD for my sony cybershot TX20. It worked rigth away on my camera. I'll uptdate this awfull review in a couple of months.", "really nice and fast I used for my camera and works like a charm, i will definitely recommend this card", "I use this in my T3i - very fast save time and great for downloads.  I highly recommend this for DSLR cameras.", "I have not speed tested this card against other Class 10 devices, but I have had good experience with Transcend brands in the past and this one seems to work fine too.", "Super great value on this SD card. It worked perfectly on my Canon T4i and pictures are saved quickly. It works on all the computers I plug it into and data transfer rate is great. 16GB is a lot of memory and pretty much lasts an entire week of vacation photos.", "Nice little Flash Memory Card.  It never goes wrong to have couple extra around.  I use it for everything digital, from music for my car to storage for cameras, files for my laptop and tablet.", "I bought one last year (2011) for my HD camcorder, and bought another this year for general storage. It's quite reliable and it performs well on reads and write. Not the fastest on the market but its above average. For the price, they are worth it for what I need.", "I buy these Transcend 32gb SDHC cards in quantities of 10. They work in desktops, laptops, tablets, and cameras.  I use them for backup.  I use them to hold pictures I have taken (several thousand a month).  I use them to transport data of all sorts.  I find them to work with all my devices.Now, for real-and-implied speed.  Unfortunately, each device, I have, treats each vendor's card, for some reason, differently.  I have found the same card works at top speed in one device; yet, in another device it is painfully slow.  Then -- ALSO -- slowness depends on my mood, attitude, and need in getting something done immediately and right now.  Perhaps, the card and what is being done is also a part of the slowness?On the other hand, there is no problem when what I am doing gets done very quickly regardless of which card I am using; AND, it may have been a card whose performance at another time was so slow; so painfully slow.  Which means benchmarks are wonderful and give a baseline though this baseline may be meaningless in actual operating conditions to include the type of information/data, stress and device and software and hardware and cables and etc. variances.Said another way, I have learned to buy the SDHC cards (CF and SDXC cards, too) based on my budget and previous experience.  This allows me to get cards that work in my devices.  I do not recall any of the hundred, or so, of these Transcend cards, that I have purchased at Amazon, ever going physically bad or becoming permanently unusable.I would say these cards are a good purchase for the price and my experience in using them.", "I purchased these when they were on sale 16gb for 10.99.  Bought 2 extra for my camcorder for some projects coming up.  Its a class 10 cant be that for the price.", "Works great in my Kodak Camera, now more space to store pictures and videos, seems fairly fast as well. So far so good.", "This is used in our Digital SLR and it works great. No lag and there is a ton of storage.  Otherwise not much to review, it's an SD card with 32GB of storage."], "Gamma": [0.09143228828907013, 0.09143228828907013, 0.09143228828907013, 0.09136255830526352, 0.09143228828907013,
