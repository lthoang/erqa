My common notion after opening the box is to get all the value for my money, one of which is to use everything that came in the box-- until resell or retirement of the camera. Plus, I get to 'flash' my favorite camera brand. :)However, I considered an upcoming wedding shoot that I will be doing and I wasn't sure if the stock strap was up for the task. Er, let me rephrase that, I mean I wasn't sure if my shoulders were up for the task. It wasn't really a debate at all, I knew I needed to beef up the padding of my strap-- enter RS-7.I can't imagine how my shoulders would have fared with a stock strap after a 5-day journey into Disney World theme parks. Obviously I was still sore but Black Rapid saved me a lot of pain and eased my shifting quickly into shooting position.I would recommend this as I found it really useful. Material used is top-notch and high quality. I got it wet several times down in FL but still looks new. You definitely are getting what you pay for. It also somehow provides me a means for a 'stealthy-look' just because now no camera enthusiast would be able to tell what camera I shoot with from afar. A &#34;Canon&#34;-delete mod if you will. :)", "A fantastic product. A must have for all DSLR owners, specially does of us that have telephoto lenses (i.e. 70-200mm).", "\"I have been using the stock Nikon strap but it was starting to get very uncomfortable for long shooting days. I read on the FROKNOWSPHOTO website and he gave this a great review. Also I had recently purchased the HEAVY Nikkor 70-200 2.8 VRI and there was no way I could use the stock strap as I could not let the weight of the lens hang and possible damage the mounting ring on my Nikon D3100. The strap has a heavy duty fastener which screws securely into the tripod thread on the bottom of the camera. It's way more comfortable then the stock strap with thick padding on the shoulder area. It is also adjustable with \"\"stoppers\"\" front and rear to position the camera which you feel its most comfortable. I highly recommend this strap and I was so happy with it I purchased the RS-W1 for my Wife. She also really enjoys the comfortable of her strap as well.\"", "I just bought my second one for my backup camera. Wear the two of them in a criss-cross when I need both on me. Still comfortable enough without the connect-r piece.Great straps. Wish they were cheaper - but hey, not bad when you're supporting over ten grand worth of gear at your hip!", "Great investment and innovation.  It definitely saves my neck from cramps, and nerve pinching.  I actually need a 2nd one for my assistant during a shoot.", "I chose this strap looking for a more comfortable way to support my camera. I had been using an Op-Tech wide padded strap and liked it much better than the thin Nikon strap that came with my DSLR but thought the Black Rapid strap would be better still.First it attaches very securely to the camera by screwing into the tripod mount in the bottom of the camera.There are two clips on the strap that keep it from sliding out of the range set by you.It is quick and easy to shoot both horizontal and vertical photos. There are videos on youtube if you want to see a demo.", "I love this thing, its comfortable and easily mounts to the camera. The only thing that bothers me about the strap is that I have to unscrew it from the strap every time I want to use the camera with the tripod. Oh, and the remote/shutter release doesn't clip to the strap either. Small things though...", "The strap connects to the tripod socket which means you're carrying the camera upside down. In addition if you want to attach the camera to the tripod, you have to detach the strap from the tripod socket and then connect your camera to the tripod.I'd have been better off purchasing a strap that has metel attachments for the metal sides of the camera. Save your money and get a comfotable strap that has the features that I've mentioned.", "I love this strap, I was very worried at first since I'll be hooking up about $4,000 worth of gear to it at a minimum, but it holds very strong.  I had this on my Canon 5d Mk II with battery grip and a 70-200mm 2.8 IS lens and it held strong...I even spun it around like the ad online shows and it still held strong.  I ordered a mod that helps secure it to stay in one place better so that will be nice when I'm moving around and being more active.  I also ordered a second strap and the connector that allows you to make it into a double strap, so we'll see there.  I like this version but I've heard they have some with storage pockets...personally I prefer the low profile, especially when I'm at weddings and need to look classy and professional, not like batman.", "this strap is on my dslr all the time, weather it's hiking, family event, walk in the park.  whatever the occasion is, it's on my camera.  takes the weight off your neck and put it on ur shoulder.", "I bought a cheaper strap at Best Buy recently and fell in love with the rapid access to my camera while travelling.  Upgraded to this strap after a recent trip and well worth it.  It's very comfortable and convenient.", "\"Hmmm...how do I start?  There are many days that I walk around all day long, with my heavy D700 hanging off of my shoulder...like weddings and bike rides, etc.  The Nikon strap on my D700 is terrible.  It likes to slip off of your shoulder...or when used around your neck...makes you feel like your carrying an anchor on your chest.Product: Black Rapids RS-7 and Buck-1.It's pricey at $58 for the strap, and $10 for the buckle cover, so when I tell my friends about it, I usually say this, \"\"Sure, it's a lot to pay for no more material than it's made of, but functionally, it's worth twice the price.  I would never give mine back.Right after I received the RS-7, we went on vacation.  I walked all over Key West, Key Biscayne, and South Beach in the 82 degree heat, for up to 8 hours a day...with my heavy D700 and 24-70MM lens on my hip, using this strap.  It was like a miracle cure...the weight distribution using the RS-7 versus the Nikon Camera strap was wonderful. The camera felt as if it had lost about 80% of it's weight.It's quick to set up.  Adjust the strap for your body, let the camera hang, and set the limiters on either side of the camera, so that when you move your camera from your hip to your face for a shot, you ensure that the shoulder pad will move back to it's correct position when you let the camera hang on your hip again.  Attach your buckle protector, and that's it, enjoy.Is it worth the $68.00 price tag for both...yep...would I do it again, yep.  I'm getting one for my wife and her D300.I will add that there are other, less expensive, sling type camera straps out there and maybe one of them will suit your needs equally well, or better...Last word...not much material for the price...but nicely crafted from first rate components...and well worth the price.  Mine will not come off of my camera.\"", "I've heard a lot of bad things about letting the camera hand upside down, Nikon wont make the warranty valid, let that be a warning. But the strap does work wonderfully! It is comfortable compared to the stock strap, the material are almost military grade. Fast acces to the camera, no damage to it and I've used this strap on a nikon D3000 and D7000, both working like a charm and both using a 55-200 lens.Black Rapid is THE choice on fast straps, if you get the extra pouches, everything fits just right.", "\"If you read my review of the BlackRapid SnapR, then you already know how much I love BlackRapid straps. BlackRapid's original R-Strap was created by a professional photographer named Ron Henry. His idea to turn a camera strap into a \"\"sling\"\" was ingenious. The RS-7 strap is one of seven available R-Straps from BlackRapid. The RS-7 is unique from their other single straps because it was designed as a modular system with an ergonomically curved pad. Though this review is specific to the RS-7, much of the review about the R-Strap system applies to all of their R-Straps.PROS:- Very well built and durable- Clear advantage in ease of use- Very comfortable- MODS can be daisy-chained- Easily adjustableCONS:- Bumpers can be a little tough to undoInevitably, the question, \"\"why do I need to buy a strap when my camera already came with one?\"\" will be asked. The answer is that OEM camera straps tend to be uncomfortable when worn for extended periods of time and aren't usually secured very well when worn around the neck. Have you ever tried bending down to pick something up or tried to give someone a hug with the camera around your neck? It doesn't work out that well, does it? From the perspective of a parent, having my camera around my neck makes me nervous. My toddlers require me to constantly bend down, pick them up, carry them, or run after them. Taking my camera and my kids to the park is a chore because I have to decide whether or not I want to be involved in their play (and safety) or taking their photos, but not both. The BlackRapid RS-7 changed all that.DESIGN & BUILDThe R-Strap name is a bit of misnomer because they're actually slings. They are meant to be worn over the shoulder. Due to the ergonomic curvature of the pad, it's specifically meant to be worn over the left shoulder. At the end of the strap is what BlackRapid calls a ConnectR that works like a locking carabiner. The ConnectR attaches to your camera via a metal loop, called a FastenR, that screws into the tripod port of your camera or lens. After placing the R-Strap on, your camera actually hangs upside down on your right hip. When you want to take a photo, you simply grab your camera and glide it up the strap to eye level. When you're done, you slide it back down the strap. There are also two \"\"bumpers\"\" on the strap that keep your camera from moving. The bumper located on the rear of the strap allows you to position the camera at its resting point, while the bumper on the front of the strap can be adjusted to keep the camera from shifting forward. The bumpers are intended to be adjusted on the fly to remain flexible to your needs. If you need to free up your hands, you can adjust them so that the camera cannot be shifted at all then move them back when you're ready to shoot again. Adjusting them was fairly easy but I think having an easier to grip material on the clip would make it easier to open for quick adjustments.The build quality on the RS-7 is top notch. The ballistic nylon material is durable yet attractive and the metal hardware appear to be very high quality. They really paid very close attention to all the details. Even the \"\"R\"\" logo looks very cool in my opinion and BlackRapid warranties all R-Straps for one year.THE REAL WORLDSome of the coolest gadgets and devices ever made were also some of the most useless. The RS-7 isn't just cool, it's functional. I love being able to take my kids to a park and take photos of them and the beautiful landscape around them. Before I invested in a DSLR, I was using my mobile phone for that task, which was convenient as heck, but didn't usually result in terrific picture quality. The problem with my DSLR was the bulk. I had to carry it in a camera bag to the park then once I got to the park, I'd have to strap the camera around my neck. Interacting with my kids at this point was challenging. With the R-Strap, I am now able to leave my bag behind and just carry the camera to the park with me. If my youngest needs me to carry her, I can just bend down and pick her up without worry. When I want to take a photo, I can quickly adjust the strap to allow me to shoot, then secure it back again. It's a liberating experience.MODSThe RS-7 is made to work with all of BlackRapid's MODS accessories. It has a built-in loop that allows accessories, like the JOEY, to securely attach to the strap.JOEY - The JOEY is a storage pocket and comes in two versions, theJOEY J1and theJOEY J2. They are exactly the same except that the J1 is small and the J2 is large. The J1 can fit up to an iPhone without a case and the J2 can fit up to an iPhone with a small case. The J2 fit my Motorola Droid X with a slim TPU case on it. It was a little tight at first but it loosened up a little bit after a few uses. The neat thing about the JOEY is that you can securely daisy-chain them to gain more pockets.BRAD- The BRAD is an essential RS-7 MOD in my opinion. It's basically another strap that attaches to the RS-7 that helps secure your camera even further. It sort of makes the strap look like a shoulder holster. The BRAD is ideal for active shooting and I recommend it for parents as well. The only slight downside is that it adds an extra step when putting the strap on or taking it off.BUCK- The BUCK is a nifty little buckle cover for the RS-7. It securely covers the buckle so that thieves can't just unbuckle your strap and run off with your camera. It also ensures that the buckle doesn't accidentally get unbuckled while you're wearing the RS-7.BERT- The RS-7 is 60\"\" long from end to end. If you need extra length, you can get it with the BERT MOD. It adds an additional 15\"\".CONCLUSIONBlackRapid R-Straps are easy to use, comfortable, and have superb build quality. The RS-7 and its MODS system offer a flexible alternative to the RS-4 and RS-5. The RS-7 isn't the only strap I own, but it's the only one I now use. It won't make my shots turn out like Ron Henry's, but it will give me all the advantages that his strap provides. Pay the man and get the RS-7. You'll be glad you did.* Review sample courtesy of BlackRapid Inc.\"", "This is waaaaaay better than the standard camera strap that cam with my canon camera. It's very comfortable to wear and the quality of the stitching is awesome. This is my second BR strap the reason its my second is I left the first one in DC. So when it came to buy another I didn't even look at the competition and bought this right away.", "Does what its suppose to do, works well and its conformable. recommended to anyone looking for a good strap. Smooth action bring up the camera while shoulder pad stays in place.", "So much better than a neck strap.  Recently purchased a very heavy zoom lens with tripod collar.  Impossible to carry using the standard neck strap.  This strap is well made, though I have to say, it would be even nicer if a little less expensive.Originally ordered the RS-5, but the strap was too bulky.  Put that stuff in your pockets or bag, and order this RS-7 instead.I recommend this strap - or at least on like it!", "\"After hassling with other types of neck and shoulder straps I finally broke down and bought the RS-7. I agree it's a bit overpriced for what it is, but it's a small price to pay for something that holds my camera *securely*, leaves my hands free yet keeps my camera both on the down-low and rapidly accessible. If you do any street photography you've got to know what I'm talking about. The materials and overall construction are such that this sling will outlive most of it's owners children. The hardware is robust and the connection to the tripod mount is well thought out with a thick rubber washer that prevents the screw from coming loose. Coupled with using the hook as a lever (per the instructions) to really tighten the mount I have not one concern about anything coming loose. I also like that the hook has a screw-down that eliminates the possibility of the hook separating from the mount. Probably not needed but it's nice that it's there. I also like the security of the cross-body design: your camera can't slip off your shoulder and it can't be ripped out of your hand (tourists take note). The plastic clips are nice, but could be improved perhaps. I'd like to see them have a slightly more aggressive bite to keep them in place. They're adequate to the task so I can't really complain about them and they do a good job at keeping the sling adjusted to your body correctly. I have only two, pretty nit-picky complaints about the RS-7. First thing is that the strap itself is almost over-engineered. The materials used are robust - very robust in fact - and because of that the RS-7 feels much like a brand new, never-been-washed pair of jeans: just a bit stiff and bulky. I'd love an RS-7 \"\"Lite\"\" version that used the same basic materials, maybe just a little less of it. But, that being said, once I'm actually wearing the sling this issue pretty much disappears but again, it's the difference between a brand new pair of dark jeans and your \"\"old faves\"\" that are soft and totally broken in: the first is all good, the second is just *better*. The other nit-pick I have is the screw-in mount that attaches to the tripod socket on the camera. If you're going to be taking this sling off a lot to put your camera down you're going to have to deal with the mount still being in the tripod socket unless you want to unscrew the sling. The screw-in mount for the sling's hook, being in the tripod socket, will keep the camera body from sitting flat on, say, a tabletop and if you're not careful it could gouge or dent a wood surface. This really is a pretty minor point but it's just a little unnerving having my camera body be so wobbly sitting on a tabletop. Of course unscrewing the mount is the obvious solution and if need be, that's what I do. It's just one inherent difference between a strap (sling) that attaches using the tripod mount, and regular straps that use the camera body attachment points.\"", "Works just as I hoped it would.  Holds a Canon 60d with a 70-300 solidly, making shooting much easier than out of a bag.", "I really love this strap. From carrying around a d3200 and a d800 with a 24-70 and a 70-200 lens. the camera can really pull down your neck and cause fatigue. you don't have that issue using this strap. I plan on buying the strap where I can carry both camera one on each shoulder", "I carry around a Nikon D7000 with Battery Grip and 70-300 lens attached, most of the time.  This strap redistributes the weight and makes carrying your camera more like a messenger bag.Regular camera straps that go around the neck become uncomfortable, but I can wear this all day with no issues.Don't leave home without it!", "Lesson learned...I should have gotten this strap a long time ago! It's really comfortable and great for those quick action shots. Now I don't have to struggle with my Nikon D700 and the pain in the neck Nikon strap. A must have if you're on vacation and take a lot of photos.", "I've been through three different popular straps (including stock, UpStrap, and neoprene) and this one has been the best all around by far. It does seem pricey for what it is, but when you're selling the best I guess you can get away with charging so much. I'm buying another for my other camera body.", "Good camera strap but it creates problems when you use it with a tripod.  I was able to use the Black Rapid D-Ring accessory after modifying Arca Swiss compatible quick release mounts on a Vanguard Tripod system.  As far as using the strap, I am easily able to carry heavy cameras with lenses with ease.  I no longer have a camera strap tugging at the back of my neck.  I sure wish Black Rapid made a Arca Swiss compatible quick release.  That would solve a lot of problems for folks with tripods and such a universal device would work for most photographers who use tripods.", "now this is designed correctly, straps lock in, it does not slide, it fits like a glove, very well made", "Considering that other similar, in every way, units go for less than $10.00, yes, this is overpriced.  But hey, people like me are willing to pay it (for now), so why not.  Good for them.Is is worth it? I think only for the peace-of-mind factor.  You spend as much as a car for a camera and lens, yes, you do want to feel it is secured by proven accessories.  Is it truly more secure? I own this one and a $10.00 equivalent, and I have had no problems with either.  Ever.  I just make sure that for both that the fastener is ALWAYS tight, and use a little common sense.As for comfort, the neck strap is a little thinner (i.e., more comfortable) with this one, but for a fat guy like me, the $10.00 one has a little longer (i.e., more comfortable) strap.Conclusion: would I buy it again? Yes,  But then again when the time comes to buy the double strap for two cameras, unless I have $5000.00-location shoots by then and both my cameras are Canon 1D's with L lenses,  I think I will go with the cheaper alternative ($130.00? Seriously?).", "I've been using DSLRs for over 10yrs now and I've always used the strap that comes with the camera.  I wish I would have tried this strap long ago.  It is so much more comfortable than the strap that comes with the camera.  Having the camera resting on the shoulder vs around the neck makes a huge difference, particularly when you are out and about all day.  No neck soreness with this strap.  You can bring your camera up to shooting position even with one hand and it feels very natural.  Will be buying another to go with my other camera body.", "This is an awesome product at a fair price. There are times when I carry my camera at fairs and events I really want to have it handy when I need it but also out of the way so my hands are free. My wife bought this for me and it's great. Once you get the strap adjusted and the camera fitted, it just drop to your side ready for use. Just grab your camera and shoot a few frames.I can walk through crowds without having to worry about my lens sticking into the mass of bodies.

I also received theBRAD (Black Rapid Arm Defense) Strapwhich keeps the RS-7 pulled down away from my neck which is more comfortable.Excellent product. If you carry your camera with and want to keep your hands free, this is the strap for you.", "This is a great strap for any style camera.  It sits on your right hip next to your hand.  The strap makes it easy to grab the camera and get the shot.", "Love this strap! I've used it on several trips, events, etc. and it's super-handy to bring your camera up, take the shot and let 'er drop right back down to the adjustable stoppers. Build quality is solid and the material held-up well for me during a fairly wet trip to the Smokeys.The quick-release system is great - just be sure to get extra fasteners for your other lenses or it'll be pointless.", "\"I shoot a lot of vertical shots [portrait mode].  Unfortunately, when shooting vertical, your right hand can no longer be flush with the bottom of the camera/grip.  This makes holding more stressful, and I have a red indentation mark in my hand where the fastener was applying pressure to my hand/wrist.  If you happen to be using a lens with a tripod mount / collar, you will not have this problem.  However, most lenses do not have this option.  Something to think about before getting this type of strap.Adjusting to the \"\"correct size\"\" took a little bit of effort and experimentation.Otherwise the materials seem pretty sturdy.I'm debating putting the OEM strap back on again, will have to use it a little more before deciding.\"", "Because I use a tripod 70% of the time, my primary need is for a camera strap that detaches quickly and cleanly.

My RS-7 is attached to anAcratech 1136 Manfrotto Video Adapter, which is clamped to a Really Right Stuff L-Plate.  The Acratech 1136 is a little bulky for this purpose, but it is very light nice to have it handy for its intended purpose.  Many have mentioned using a Really Right Stuff B2-FAB-F 38mm clamp to connect the Black Rapid strap to an Arca-Swiss camera plate.I was at first concerned about the security of both attachments, but now I'm confident the connections are solid.The strap is very comfortable and I like the sling.
