Unfortunately the end result did not meet my expectations. Installation on a Windows XP system was a little involved mainly because I have a Creative Audigy 2 ZS soundcard which needed updated drivers. I am happy that the Creative installer recognized this component and updated it, but this process took about an hour to download and install all the recommended drivers.Running the system was relatively straightforward and it did control iTunes play, pause, next track, and so on. However, without a display, the remote was not as useful as it could be. In addition, this remote control does not appear to work on Macs (tested on older Powerbook G4 running Mac OS X 10.4). For Macs, the device is just used for remote playback, controlled at the console. Perhaps Creative will release remote access software for the Mac in the future. This product does appear to be very expandable with additional receivers in separate zones, if desired.I did not like that all audio is sent to the transmitter. This means no system sounds or other audio are heard locally. These would be heard along with the iTunes/Windows Media audio. This is a strange feature with no apparent way to override. Another questionable choice is using the 2.4GHz band. This is also the Wi-Fi frequency band so there is potential for conflict. I did experience this with a laptop running Vista and was not able to fully test this product with that computer. The User's Guide recommends manually selecting another channel (there are three, which correspond to Wi-Fi channels 1, 6, and 11) but just decided that this was not the right wireless audio system for me.", "\"I had a lot of trouble trying to get the AirPort to stream from iTunes to my stereo.  I attributed that to the fact that it's an Apple product trying to interface with iTunes for Windows.  I was excited to find out about this Creative product, specifically engineered for Windows.  I unloaded the box, which had very few parts, and opened the manual.  All I had to do was insert a USB dongle transmitter in my computer, attach a receiver to my stereo, and double-click on a song in iTunes.  Great!  Except, I did that, and nothing happened.  The white LED (which is excessively bright) on the receiver was blinking.  According to the manual, that meant there was no contact between the transmitter and receiver.  As suggested in the button, I pressed the hidden \"\"contact\"\" button on the dongle, and was rewarded with a solid white LED light.  But I still couldn't get a song on iTunes to play on my stereo.At that point, I read a few Amazon reviews of the product, and found out that, despite what the manual said, you had to install the Creative software that accompanied it.  Great, did it!  Then none of the many, many programs that it added worked, except for a Vista widget, and even that didn't let me stream music to my stereo.  At that point, I gave up.  I have a two-year-old and limited patience and time for this sort of thing.  This product, and I think iTunes streaming wirelessly to a stereo, is remarkably still not ready for prime time.  Pass.\"", "I had come to expect good quality products from Soundblaster but this far surpasses that description. The instructions were quite clear and simple and putting the item to use was also without exception or difficulty. Then not suprisingly, the performance exceeded all expectations. I have owned other wireless audio components but this is by far the best. My demands on it are likely less than most others but I have no doubt it will do whatever it says it will do. I would say that it is a *Best Buy* product, and Amazon can deliver it overnight.", "When I received this I was really excited to set it up and I did so immediately. In the box you have the receiver, A/C adapter for the receiver w/ removable plug, USB transmitter, remote control, batteries for the remote, Stereo/RCA cables, cleaning cloth, installation CD and set-up instructions. (I have added pictures in the customer images to show exactly what was included.)When it came to set-up, it claims that it's plug & play so I decided to skip the installation cd and go directly to the music. First I plugged the USB transmitter into my laptop and then I plugged the receiver into an outlet and connected it via the RCA cable to my stereo. I don't have an expensive system, but it is good enough for now. Once I turned the receiver on it automatically paired up with the transmitter. From that point all I had to do was load up my iTunes and choose my playlist.The music quality is the same as if I were listening to a CD or radio. I didn't expect it to be any better coming directly from iTunes, but I had been worried about it being worse. Because we have a wireless connection in our house I tested how far I could move with my laptop and have the stereo still receive a signal. For me I could go upstairs and even out to my front porch with no noticeable difference. Additionally I tried this out on a small shelf system we have and also through our TV's. Both worked just as well as the full stereo system.Overall I think this is a very nice product, but probably best suited for the individual that has a audio system nice enough to justify the the cost of theCreative Labs Sound Blaster for iTunes Wireless Audio Transmitter and Receiver Bundle. If you are only looking to be able to play your MP3 player through your stereo, there are many less expensive options out there such as docking stations and wireless FM transmitters. But if having your entire iTunes music catalog playable through most any stereo in your home, than this might be the one. As for me, I think  might be in the market for a new system myself now.", "I never cease to be amazed at the ways Creative Labs either omits or skews the application of their products. The purchase of the Sound Blaster Wireless bundle, model SB1170 according to the naming of the product (Blaster Wireless for itunes + receiver) leads the customer to believe this product is made exclusively for the MAC. It's geared toward the MAC but a closer look into what I consider limited installation guide/product instructions indicates it will also run on the PC.As so many other customers have pointed out in their reviews (rightly so) that the instructions are lacking in many ways. I couldn't agree more.Turns out, this product does work and quite well on the PC. I happen to have it installed on a Windows 7 machine and it runs quite nicely. Creative's instructions indicate this product is geared toward itunes and windows media player. This is true to an extent but not limited to these two players. Media Monkey works without any problem on the PC side. To be honest once the transmitter and receiver are communicating, any audio source will work. This leads me to the biggest no no of all on Creative's part. I could not find any mention to the installer that your sound source had to be changed to reflect the Sound Blaster Wireless as the sound device choice. This is a glaring omission and leaves much frustration on the installer's part unless you have been down this road before. Once the transmitter emits a solid green light, and the receiver does the same, the two devices are paired. That's great but when you have no audio, the task is far from complete until you realize the need to switch the playback sound device from its default playback in the windows OS.My Amazon purchase was flawless and so too the delivery. The scenario above is in no way their fault. Once the product is working, it works well. I realize this product has been out for some time but I hope this review will help others who may be considering this product or one of Creative's other audio products.", "\"The Creative Labs Sound Blaster for iTunes Wireless Audio Transmitter and Receiver bundle suffers from a chronic Creative Labs disease: an impossibly long name that fails to characterize the product. That's too bad, because it's a quite capable audio extender system.The kit is comprised of three parts: a USB transmitter key, roughly the size of a small USB WiFi adapter, with a deployable antenna; a receiver, about the size of two decks of cards stacked on top of each other; and an infrared remote.You plug the USB transmitter into your computer, the receiver into your stereo, and you aim the remote at the receiver to control your iTunes music.The transmitter key is recognized as a standard USB audio interface: there is no need to install any drivers. It appears on the system as \"\"SB for iTunes(R)\"\". With its 3.5mm headphone and microphone jacks, it doubles as a standard audio interface, which can come in handy. A small button on the side allows pairing with the receiver. The transmitter is fairly large and Creative Labs should consider bundling a USB extender cord for installation in tight quarters.The receiver features two output ports (3.5mm stereo jack and a pair of red/white RCA connectors). It comes with a minijack to stereo RCA cable, so you pick the port you want based on the connection available on your stereo. The top features three buttons: previous, next and play/pause. On the front you will find the IR sensor for the remote as well as a bright non-defeatable \"\"on\"\" light and a red remote confirmation light that blinks when the receiver reacts to a remote signal. The receiver uses a wall-wart type power adapter.The small infrared remote uses two AAA batteries (supplied) to control basic operation of the system and iTunes.Sound quality is impeccable at short distances, but worsens as the distance increases or if the transmitter and receiver are separated by obstacles such as walls or furniture. In my application they are 20 ft apart and separated by a plasterboard wall: there are no interferences and I can't tell the sound apart from a wired connection when listening to MP3 music.Unfortunately, Creative has not yet implemented iTunes support on the Mac, so the only functional keys on the remote are power, mute and volume: you can't control iTunes from it -- a bit of a problem for a product that has iTunes in its name and claims Mac compatibility.Creative sells other compatible devices that you can use to build a full multizone system: headphones, speakers, iPod dock.I would not recommend this product to a Mac user looking for remote iTunes listening, due to the incomplete Mac support: an Airport Express would be a better choice, especially when paired with the free Remote app for iPod Touch or iPhone.However, on Windows this is a quite capable, full featured system with great sound quality at a very reasonable price that I have no problem recommending.Please note that I will recommend this system for Mac users as well once Creative ships a software package that fully supports their product on OSX.\"", "First of all I love this thing!  All of my music is on a Desk Top PC in the back bedroom and I needed a way to play those songs on my home stereo amp in the living room.  After looking at much more expensive and complicated options I decided to give this a try!After cutting and tearing through abundant retail style anti-theft packaging I simply plugged everything in.  After that little exercise that required a razor knife, I opened Windows Media Player, selected a play list and like magic music played in the living room!Great so far right?  After less than a minute I lost my wireless internet connection.  I removed the USB transmitter and the internet was up and running again... This is where I was possibly lead astray by the on-line help files.  First I was instructed to change the channel on my router.  I choose channel 11.  (There are 4 common choices for a router channel: Auto, 1, 6 and 11) I choose channel 11. I then set the the USB wireless transmitter to channel 1.  Actually the transmitter is set to channel 1 by default, but I now know how to change it if need be.  You'll need to install the software to do this.The idea was since both the Wireless Router and the USB transmitter operate in the 2.4 GHZ band, they can interfere with each other.  By selecting channels far apart you might eliminate interference.  While this was a FUN learning experience into the technical world of wireless routers and such, I still lost my wireless internet when the USB transmitter was connected.Did I mention I really like this thing! But I also like having internet on my PC.  I contemplated my options which included reconfiguring my on-board wireless internet or buying a separate network card and disabling the on-board chip.  While a network card is cheap enough and easy to install, I kept wondering if there was a better way.Okay here we go... I purchased a USB extension cable!  I connected everything again and placed the transmitter a few feet away from the PC.  Drum roll please!  Everything now works!  I can use the internet while others listen to music in the living room.  PERFECT!", "I bought one a few time ago and now I'm buying another, the idea is to have two places that receive the same audio, this device has very good quality and good range. I recommend it.", "For the money this is at now you just cannot beat it, My parents needed a wireless setup mostly to stream talk radio, after looking through different Bluetooth dongles and receivers this is by far the most cost effective. Amazing in this day and age it is still hard to get good wireless setups we are mostly stuck back in 2005 unless you can afford a large chunk of money, but i digress.The sound is excellent from at least the speakers i have tried it on, it is running 50 feet through one wall with no problems.Also my parents plugged it up themselves so it must be easy!!! Of course it went straight to the usb setting in sound if it did not i would have gotten a call", "\"[UPDATE as of October 2011]I recently developed a need for a device doing just this, so I pulled it out to try again. I don't know what my problem was last time, but this time it worked perfectly immediately, and I *love* that it's not limited to broadcasting iTunes sounds as the Airport Express is, because now most of what I'm doing is watching streaming video in Safari on my MacBook. The one trick to getting this to work with the Mac is that you have to go into System Preferences/Sound and select it as the output. Every now and then you have to do that again. Every now and then the dongle doesn't immediately start broadcasting when you plug it in, and you have to pull it out and put it in again, but after doing that once or twice, it always seems to work eventually. The only con I can see now is that I suspect it might be interfering with my wireless network, as I've had infrequent but intermittent problems with the connection since I started using this. Annoying, but I'm not totally sure it's this device, and it's infrequent enough that it's not a deal-breaker. Anyway, I haven't used any other product of this kind, but this does exactly what I want it to do, with only a small amount of hassle.[END OF UPDATE][I'm leaving the original review below, for the sake of integrity or something --]The idea of a modular wireless sound system is *very* appealing to me. I've been looking for an excuse to bring some nicer speakers into the house, but the idea of hooking them up to my computer every time I want to play music or watch a TV show just doesn't seem very realistic, and all my music is on my computer. I've several times been on the verge of buying an Airport Express (gave my last one to my parents when I bought a Time Machine), but haven't taken the plunge. When I saw this available through Amazon Vine, I wondered about the practicality of a USB transmitter, but thought it had to be better than setting the laptop up next to the speakers.Unfortunately, I couldn't get this to work with my MacBook running Snow Leopard at all. The transmitter and receiver indicate through blinking lights whether or not they're paired with each other. It took a while to get them to think they were paired, but even when the lights were solid, the sound came only through the computer speakers. I tried installing the software -- Creative Labs claims it's all Plug 'n Play -- but to no avail.On my Windows partition, it worked flawlessly and immediately. Perfectly. Beautifully. The sound was great.Big con, though -- unlike the Airport Express, which receives audio *only* from iTunes, the Sound Blaster \"\"for iTunes\"\" takes over and transmits *all* of your computer's audio. So every program beep gets played on the big speakers. This means that even if you were using it with a desktop (which I'm thinking, given the USB dongle, might be the best audience for this device), you wouldn't want to leave it plugged in all the time, unless you were going to remember to turn off your speakers when they weren't in use. Or not mind walking to them to turn them off when the incessant beeps and bings of Vista got to be too much.Having only one transmitter and one receiver, I can't comment on how well the zoning system works. If it works as advertised, this might be the only reason to pay for this one, rather than the (significantly) less for an Airport Express. The other thing this offers, of course, *is* that it will broadcast all of your computer's audio, so if you're wanting sound from a program other than iTunes, this will accommodate you where the Airport won't. Unless, that is, you're running Snow Leopard. Then this won't help at all.\"", "Wireless is so finicky, I can understand why this device would not work for some.  I waited a long time to buy it for that reason, but finally after hanging out on my wishlist for a couple years someone bought it for me.  I am glad they did because it works very well for what i needed it for:  getting whatever audio was playing on my computer to play on my home stereo system, wirelessly.First of all, I don't use iTunes so I pretty much tossed the remote as it is worthless to me.  Same thing with the pause and forward/back buttons on the unit itself.  I have this thing plugged into my receiver.  When I want to start this thing up, I power it and the receiver on and then go into the basement where the computer is.  I plug the transmitter into the USB port on my computer, and that's it.  My comp recognizes it and switches all computer audio to the device.  The only way to disable it is to change it through Control Panel, or simply unplug the transmitter.  if you forget to do this and decide to fire up some internet porn, the audio is going to blast out of the living room speakers and everyone will know what you're up to.The sound is really good.  Sometimes the signal drops in and out at the new house, but that is because the transmitter is down in the basement.  At my old house they were on the same floor and there was never any interference.", "So i had an novel thought with this little gizmo, what if I loaded my itunes library on my acer $300 netbook and used the YSB adapter to stream music to my home stereo. It worked great! Sound quality was adequate but I assume some loss due to the compression of wireless-ness. Set up was a cinch, i had to download the software since my netbook doesn't have a CD drive. And once installed, the remote worked great and it was very convenient. The range seemed quite good also.", "\"Creative's Sound Blaster is an easy enough concept to grasp.  However, simple set-up is not always guaranteed.  Simply plug the transmitter into a USB port in your laptop, plug the receiver into your stereo inputs (or wireless speakers), plug that in and you should be on your way.  Nope.  Not my experience.  I fussed with this for two weeks before I got it to work and that included three Emails to support and a phone call.  I even contacted TOP Reviewer Kristen (Modern Blue Argonaut) for help!You really do need to install the software, even though Creative says you don't need to.  This sets up an icon box on your desktop.  You also need to open iTunes to select songs.  `Pairing' the transmitter and receiver was simple enough after a few tries.  Make sure to do them in order.  But even after I had all the connections working and `talking' to one another, there was no sound.  I had my receiver set to CD input where my L/R cables were plugged in and the RCA jack plugged into the receiver.  This is very misleading in the instructions, where it shows the L/R cables plugged into the receiver and the RCA jack plugged into the stereo.  However, THAT might be appropriate IF you are only using self-powered speakers.Anyway, after several deep breathes, I tried again by selecting songs from my laptop and `voila!', it worked.  I used the Sound Blaster Jukebox on my desktop to work iTunes.  Then the real test.  I took my laptop to the far end of my condo and it still played cleanly and crisply through three walls (kitchen included).  So I am very happy at this point, even though my sub-woofer is not playing.All these electronic devices lately are getting smaller and smaller and you are treated to a tiny remote measuring 5-1/2\"\" by 1-1/2\"\".  It was clearly `talking' to my receiver, as the light flashed red, then white when buttons were pushed, but it only worked with sound volume.  None of the other buttons worked at all.  So here is where I called support.  They supplied me with the number after three Emails.  I went through two support people with the remote control issues when I was told this.  \"\"Creative's product is still new and we are working out some of the issues with the remote control, so at this moment we cannot give you information\"\".  How's that for support?  At least I could understand the people I was talking to.The Creative Sound Blaster does work, however it is for designed for a smaller sound system.  It would be great in a dorm room or in small apartment, but as a wireless remote sound system, it is limited.  One nice thing is that you can watch YOUTUBE while listening to it on your sound system.  I would recommend theLogitech Squeezebox Duet WiFi Internet Radio, but I also had trouble with that as I had to install a DSL/phone jack in my stereo room (oddly it had none).  One reviewer referred to this as the \"\"poor man's squeezebox\"\" and that's fair enough, but I'm not at all happy with the setup time, support or ease factor.\"", "After reading some reviews about this product, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and put it to work.  This thing is awesome!!!!! The hardest part of the setup was to connect the receiver to my stereo which is in an enclosure along with all the other electronic gear and tv in my family room.  I had to run wires through shelves and move my tv and the stereo to get at everything, but in the end it was worth it. I hooked the receiver up to the Pioneer stereo in the spot left vacant when I got rid of my cd player, whose job was taken over by a DVD player that also plays cd's.  With 80gb of music on my computer I seldom use a cd.I first hooked the receiver up to the stereo and turned it on, then put the transmitter in my laptop in the adjoining room and turned on Rhapsody.  Wow!! when the sound came on it was from the stereo and sounded great. I then took the transmitter into my den and hooked it up to the Mac desktop and changed my preferences on the sound to SB for iTunes and I was playing Rhapsody from my Mac to the stereo at the other end of the house. No interference, no drop in sound quality and no lapses in the music.  PERFECT!!!!I don't think I will have any problem with interference with my wi-fi, because I don't intend to use my laptop and the sound blaster at the same time. When I'm not using the sound blaster I disconnect it from my Mac. When I want I can transfer it to my vaio laptop and it works instantly. Creative Labs continues to make good stuff.", "I am spoiled owning and loving the Logitech Squeezebox Duet and Boom systems.  Love them.  But, they are not so portable.This little thing comes in handy if you don't want to dedicate a system to a unit.  You don't want to install software.  You have no idea what a WEP key is.  etc. etc.  If you know what a USB slot looks like on your computer, and know where to hookup your speakers on your stereo or other music unit, you are good to go.It's a set of mini electronic fun with a big party sound of music.  Whatever system your digital music is stored, and if you have iTunes, even better, just put the USB antenna thingy into an open slot.  Then take the little hub and stick your speakers in, and you are done.  Whatever source of sound broadcasting device you can stick in, it will play whatever is on your host system.  Use the handy remote to click around, and you're done.  The remote is small, but I would not want it bigger because the main appeal here is the portability.If you have wireless speakers or headphones, that's even better.  Anyone in the house or backyard etc. can tap into the music filling your place with sound.  I tested this on my iMac, my PC laptop and a PC desktop.  I have Snow Leopard on my Mac, and it did it's own configuration process, and  I was ready to go.  I did not need to use the software.It's not the most perfect sounding experience, and may take a little tweaking of certain things that you might want to connect to it.  But I love the fact that I can easily bring this to any computer and not have to setup a network or enter codes etc.The list price point for this brand and genre of electronics is about 33% too high.  The competition may push this unit aside if the price does not come down to the double digits soon.  It also would have been nice to have a case included since there is initially 3 items, and possible cords etc.  Not a bad item, but it's about 3.5 stars based on the competition.", "Set-up is made tricky, primarily due to the need to pair the USB connector with the receiver--and the pairing button on the USB connector is very small, almost invisible, and difficult to press.  It took me a good 20 minutes to get it paired.Once the device was paired and I took a trip to System Preferences, I got audio coming out out of the speakers.  But I never got the remote to control iTunes and it's not clear how to fix this.  The audio quality is nice; there's nothing wrong with that aspect of the product.  I do wish there was a TOSlink (optical) audio connector on the back to make it easier to plug into a receiver, but the dual RCA plugs are OK.Another drawback is the size of the USB connect--it's quite large and overlaps with other ports.  My MacBook Pro can only use this device on the right side USB port if I want to have the laptop connected to AC power.  The case should be narrower and focus on the audio output (lose the microphone port if that's what it takes to make the USB connector narrower).All of this might be tolerable, except it interferes with my Bluetooth mouse.  I didn't notice any WiFi degradation, but my Bluetooth mouse turns into a jumpy cursor--pretty much useless.The concept is very cool--I have a lot of AirPort Expresses around the house which I control with our iPhones loaded up with Apple's free Remote application, but I thought this device might be a better solution.It isn't.  Especially for such a high price.  If your goal is to hear iTunes in another room or on a stereo away from the computer, buy Apple's AirPort Express instead.", "My husband and I tested the Creative Labs Sound Blaster with a Windows PC machine and our stereo receiver.  Installation was relatively easy and it loaded as an alternate sound output device without much fuss.Note #1:  The first USB port we tried would not connect.  We used the adjacent USB port and had immediate success.  This could be, and probably is, a Windows problem.Once we plugged into to the stereo receiver we could stream from iTunes and other sources.  The sound quality was good, but not audiofile good.Note #2:  We tried different music from different formats to see if a different source might effect the quality.  We couldn'tThe real problem with the entire setup was the signal drop.  At no time could we get the music to play for longer than 5 minutes.  And at no point was a reconnection ever automatically established.  You had to manually press reset.So DO NOT recommend.  Our test distance was 15 feet and if it can't cope with that distance, it certainly isn't really a whole house device.", "This was perfect for me. I was still using the old speakers that came with my desktop and only using the built-in speakers with my netbook.  Now, I can listen via my stereo system, TV, radio, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  I was not expecting the quality to be as good as it is.Set up was very simple for me.  It really was just plug and play.  I did not need the installation discs.  I hope it is that easy for everyone!  You should keep in mind that the better the audio system you are using, the better the sound will be.If you are looking for simple set-up, nice sound quality, and a sleek design, this is the bundle for you!", "As most reviewers noted, basic volume controls will work (even on a PC) in win7 right out of the box and without installing any of the software.But most reviewers have had trouble getting advanced functions on the remote to work with a pc (like pause/play, forward/back, etc).Do this: install the software from the cd, and let it auto update when you reboot. reboot again. Then go into program>Creative>Remote Control Settings. Put a check next to 'enable control of windows applications'. Voila. What you get in windows media player at that point is play/pause and forward/back, which is quite useful. You also get cursor control with the up/down/left/right and OK buttons.Some things still didnt work for me (like 'repeat' and 'shuffle' and etc) but hey, good enough for me to have basic playlist and volume control with the remote at that point.", "It's a great idea but the implementation is not that great.You plug the USB key into your computer and let the drivers update.  Then you have to install a bunch bloat ware programs like sound control panel, mixer, and Creative updater, etc.  It takes a little while even on a fast machine and you have to restart a couple of times.  After all that is on the computer and you've hooked up the box to your receiver (by the way it did not include RCA's), it seems like you are ready to go.Then you open iTunes and press play.  No sound.  You  have to hit the button on the USB key to start transmitting and after a short delay music starts playing through your stereo.  I started it low, then tried to increase the volume (on the box, the receiver, and through iTunes).  The clarity is only so-so, almost like listening to a weak signal from an FM station.Then after about a couple of minutes the sound will go off.  You have to click the button on the USB key again and after another short delay the music starts up again.  This pattern seems to keep happening.  I tried rebooting and checking to make sure I had all the latest drivers and most recent version of iTunes.  My computer was in the next room, separated by a door that was left open and I don't have any other wireless devices in my home except for my cellular phone, so there should not have been any interferences.", "Connect the transmitter to any laptop or computer housing a music collection or whose sounds you want to broadcast. Then connect the receiver to an outlet through the included power-supply,  and connect the speakers to the included receiver. You will then be able to broadcast the music wirelessly  from your computer to the speakers connected to the receiver. You can also buy more receivers and connect other speakers throughout your house. Indecently, to make managing your music collection even more pleasurable, you might want to install the freware music managing software Winamp (best downloaded from a reputable site like cnet.com).The sound is great, but due to my apartment's layout  I have not used this device under challenging conditions.  Let me warn you that some times if the device has been connected to the computer for several days and the computer has not been rebooted for a long time, the music will sound muddy; this can be remedied by rebooting the computer with the device in the USB port. Another negative is that the transmitter has an antenna which under poor handling could be easily damaged; to diminish this possibility, I connected the receiver to a USB cable and connected the cable to my computer. This is my only complaint; so I am rating this product with a 4.", "Having used a myriad of devices from the squeezboox boom and the squeezebox duet system -- as well as a few other devices that are not worth mentioning, I'll say that this is by far the easiest to use, install and operate.Let me walk you through my set-up ... which took about 10 minutes ...1. Unpacked the box and did away with all the plastic detritus.2. Installed and registered the software on my laptop.3. Plugged in the transmitter to a USB port in the back.4. Rebooted my laptop, turned on iTunes and played a U2 album.5. Plugged in the receiver (using a nicer set of cables) to my Sony Stereo Receiver on Aux 3. Was tempted to go optical.6. Hit the find button on the underside of the little device and walked away.7. 15 seconds later -- music played.8. Stuck the batteries in the remote and turned it up.That simple and absolutely no stumbling blocks to speak of.Sound Quality? -- Better than I expected for this, but I wasn't looking for Mark Levinson to come out of my office and sit down on the couch with a glass of wine. The sound quality is more than adequate for casual home listening and the better your system is, the better the device will sound to you.Responsiveness? -- I'm constantly unplugging the transmitter from my laptop and taking off somewhere, only to come back replug it back in, and find it working almost instantly and flawlessly. Windows and iTunes are not always asking questions or looking for drivers. It seems that whatever iTunes needed to do to make this thing be compatible with itself, was worked out ahead of time by Creative Labs and Apple. That's a first.The Software -- is quite good and quite simple. You can customize it to play in zones, if that's your thing or adjust the quality of the sound and other minor changes. The software, from what I saw, doesn't appear to be a resource hog, nor has it been the culprit of crashes or bluescreens. If you don't use iTunes , you don't like to, or don't want to, this may be the only *real* problem one could face. The good thing is that it doesn't require you to depend on it as a player like other companies, or other devices do.I can find no fault with this and I'm happy with the success of this device. I use it everyday now and I'm thoroughly pleased.Well done ... a great idea to give as a gift for young or old as the ease of use with this is simple and the learning curve low. How about that for innovation?...", "\"The title says it all.  When I got this, and days before I set it up (looking over it all and planning) I kept thinking to myself how cool this will be and how it's going to fun to use.  And naturally I'm thinking that no matter what the problem I'll set aside time to get it working.  Usually I like to set aside a good hour at least for something new as there is usually a glitch or something that pops up and you cannot rush to get it right.However, I spent waaayyy too much time trying to get this working properly and still I cannot.  I'm no expert, but there's something with this that did not agree with my wireless system.  And I've gotten squeeze boxes to work in the past with no problems.Where to start (yes this is one of the rare things that frustrated me as I spent a few hours over several days with little results).....first off the concept is very cool.  As I said I wanted this to work.I could not get the USB to pair.  I could not get customer support to respond to help (despite 2 email and 3 telephone calls) only being told to \"\"we're unable to further assist, return it for a new one.\"\"  And that it sounds like there's an \"\"issue between the card and the router, but there should not be.\"\"I had to install the program (no biggie but it says you do not have to).The remote is VERY small!  Now I don't have huge hands, but especially if you are a man with average size hands there's a good chance you'll have problems with the buttons on this remote.I'm sure this will work for some people.  And with more time I could possibly get this working.  However there's only so many hours in the a day and I've had no luck.  Perhaps one rainy day I'll fiddle around with it again.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.033289358019828796, 0.001544216531328857, 0.2324073314666748, 0.00118704279884696, 0.002105332212522626, 0.0005545124295167625, 0.0005760396597906947, 0.15925630927085876, 0.01771862991154194, 0.030273929238319397, 0.007889064028859138, 0.00013305219181347638, 0.0008095672819763422, 0.0827469751238823, 0.003670474048703909, 0.0031996893230825663, 0.001751860254444182, 0.012036112137138844, 0.009474903345108032, 0.003346078796312213, 0.00013704589218832552, 0.001858463860116899, 0.3940340280532837]]}
