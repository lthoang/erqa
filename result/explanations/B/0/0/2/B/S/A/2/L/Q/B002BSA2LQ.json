Or at least it should.There are two major problems with Forza 3 and one minor one. The first being of course at least for me, is the Invalidation of your times around a race track. I never thought I would say this but I miss the overly harsh and nonsensical penalties of Forza and Forza 2. (Your lap time is already borked, if you get in a situation where you got a penalty anyway, or at least wouldn't be as fast of a lap, so penalties are stupid anyway)This time around? Oh no. They went and one upped the shenanigans now, if you get a little bit off track (and I mean just part of one tire in many cases), your lap time is completely invalidated and won't show up AT ALL on Leaderboards. Oh and the same applies for your race time too. That alone would cause a major issue to me. But it doesn't stop there. No sir. Of course if you hit someone (or they hit you for no reason) you get an invalidated time. Okay fine. It continues though, if you DRAFT SOMEONE yes, Drafting you know that thing that is pretty much ESSENTIAL to winning races, and often posting a hot lap in real life racing it invalidates your time. Colossal screw up Turn 10. Epic failure. Oh but it gets better! How you might ask? If someone Drafts you, your time is invalidated. If you use the new rewind feature to fix an other wise good lap? Invalidated. That one I can at least stomach. and that's the only one.This alone detracted a full star for me and 2 points on my gamer scale. Especially since something quintessential to racing (lap times) are now screwed out.\"\"But that appeals to the hardcore!\"\" Actually it doesn't, especially since there are some tracks where it is practically impossible to keep within the boundaries of a track while racing without incurring an invalidation either from wrecking someone or going off track. Also, it makes your Granny Lap often your best lap of the race because it only registers your \"\"screw up free\"\" lap. They better fix this in a patch, but it should have never been a problem in the first place.The next major screw up of this game is what they did to the Multiplayer. This is atrocious. Utterly atrocious and there is no excuse for this at all ever. Matchmaking in my opinion is one of the dumbest things to ever hit gaming, the only time it is \"\"passable\"\" is in Shooters but guess what? It's not passable there because of the tendency of it to give you the same maps every time you go to a new match. In a racing game? This is even worse. You only get to race in whatever class happens to be available online at the time. Effectively meaning, those really cool cars you have? Yeah, you might not get to race with them at all. No instead you might get the shaft and get stuck racing your **** of ****** Chevrolet Aveo. Yeah, imagine that happening all night. When in your garage is sitting your Realistically flame jobbed Corvette ZO6. And you don't get to pick the tracks you race on... so you remember my mentioning of a few horrible tracks that you virtually can't pass on, and stay within the Valid lap area? Imagine getting stuck on that all night too. You've got a You are In Gamer Hell scenario just exploding all over you there.Forza 1, with it's online component turned things on it's head and did it perfectly. You got to pick your car, pick your track and have a blast racing against other people and their cool cars. Forza 2 carried on with this because frankly it was right, and it wasn't perfect but it was damn close.  Forza 3? Took this feature (which is easily the Forza series best feature) shot it in the face and peed on the corpse, and left it with a parody of multiplayer.And now we come to the not as major screw up in the game. Car Accuracy. For alot of cars and I do mean alot of cars. They hit it spot on. For others? (namely three that I have found so far, and I've owned all in real life, and know the technical data of them by heart down to the spark plug gaps) they dropped the ball.  The 1990 Iroc Camaro, 2002 Camaro, and Trans Am. The first one they screwed up the Weight. By about 200 pounds. The Camaro 2002 SS weighs in at 3200lbs and some pocket change. What does Forza 3 think? 3500. Same with the Birdy, of that same year. But they one upped it with the Bird. The Bird is the WS6 version, meaning it should be packing 345 horse power, and weighs the same as the Camaro SS. It also has slightly better brakes. Forza 3 short it 25 horse power, and the better brakes along with the weight. Now the Iroc. The first screw up they did was again vehicle weight. Fully loaded with T-tops a Gen III camaro tips the scales at 3498 pounds. They say? 3600 and some change. A stripper car, like the one in the game tips in at 3234 or something like that. They also screwed up the torque curve. A Gen III with TPI injection, hits hardest at 2000 RPM on the torque, horse power following soon after and falls dead at anything past 5500. It's a rather unique looking powercurve which they messed up on.Also, please Turn 10 do note, the Chevrolet Aveo and it's ilk are not cars people willingly race. Just like we don't want to do crap license tests we don't want to drive cars that would probably sooner fall apart than hit 100 mph.That being all said. The Single Player is amazing. Pure amazing. The physics engine is easily the best in any racing game I've played, the opponent AI doesn't seem totally slaved to the racing line anymore. The new experience point system works better than the money system and the achievement progress is steady. The races are for the most part entertaining enough to keep you racing for a while. (Which is a very good thing given the multiplayer and lap time Shenanigans) The car painter is at least just as robust as it used to be, and they even added a feature. I don't know how it works yet but I will figure it out sooner or later. It's a new painter tool. Which will require more time to figure it out. Don't change this in a Forza 4.Cars are NOT LOCKED based off of level anymore. Thank God. Instead of course they locked cars based on which version of the game you bought and if you have xbox live or not (insert roll eyes here). But at least the locked car total is alot lower than it used to be.The Season system is genius and it actually feels pretty organic. I'd like to see it in a Forza 4.The in car view while it needs more polish (set too low in some cars. namely some of the cars which have accuracy issues...... making me wonder if they actually did anything with those cars in the first place) is a very nice thing to have. I bounce between it and the hood cam. (the hood cam just looks better. making me wonder if the incar view was something from beta they didn't update in time)There is one thing they did right in multiplayer and that's the Storefront feature and the Groups feature. Basically if you are a car painter or tuner you can sell set ups, and paint jobs through Live now and earn credits. Genius, and I like the feature.As long as you are playing Single Player and perhaps split screen this game is amazingly good. Just stay away from the racing aspect of multiplayer.\"", "\"I'll start by saying that I have never played this or Forza 2 online.  My online experience is limited to Call of Duty.  If you're looking for a review of the controversial multiplayer mode, there are plenty of good ones from other gamers.That said, in single player mode this game is amazing.  Not perfect, but very, very good.  I absolutely loved Forza 2, so I was concerned that Turn 10 might alter the new game in ways that would be frustrating.  Well, they did...but they made up for it (mostly) with lots of great new features.  I am a hard-core driving simulator enthusiast; except on the most frustrating factory stock races, I play everything with the AI difficulty on \"\"hard,\"\" stability control off, and manual transmission mode.  Despite this, Turn 10 has provided options to make the game EVEN HARDER or considerably easier.  In fact, this is one of the biggest new feature sets, which allows a player with just about any level of experience to set the game up to their liking.  While I won't use things like \"\"autobraking\"\" or the recommended racing line, I don't have to.Of course, Forza is all about cars, and Forza 3 delivers tons of them.  Counting the DLC, which keeps coming out, there are well over 400.  Chances are, unless you are a huge fan of Japanese \"\"kei\"\" cars or obscure pre-war European roadsters from long-disbanded manufacturers, you will find your favorite automobile in this game.  (Gran Turismo should cover you in the cases I mentioned).Forza 3 also improves upon Forza 2 with its selection of tracks.  The classics are still here (including my favorite Maple Valley) and with lots of new details thanks to the improved graphics, but new tracks debut as well, including the beautiful and extensive Amalfi Coast and the fictional series of Spanish tracks billed as \"\"Camino Viejo de Montserrat.\"\"  Additionally, the gorgeous Fujimi Kaido from Forza 1 makes a reappearance.Forza 2 had tons of customization, and Forza 3 has even more.  While everything is just about the same, there are a few new things you can do such as adding oil coolers.  On the other hand, it has also been simplified a bit; you can't choose what brand of tires you install, for example.Gameplay is just as good as before, with an improved physics engine that allows rollovers.  The graphics are phenomenal, each car is exquisitely detailed, and there is a full cockpit view from which you can drive.  If you are an extreme hard-core racer, you can even choose to drive with a button for the clutch.  This is beyond me because in real life I use feet to operate the gas, brake, and clutch while my hands can concentrate on steering and shifting.  Doing it all with my hands is too confusing.Now, the negatives.  No game is perfect, and Forza 3 has its share of flaws.  The first thing that annoyed me was the \"\"race announcer.\"\"  He won't shut up.  His bass-rich, nostalgic easy-listening voice can be heard any time you try to enter a car into a race for which it doesn't qualify (which I often do in order to quickly see which ones I own that DO qualify).Another big problem is the acquisition of cars.  In Forza 2, you got cars for leveling up via XP, and you received a car for each race series you won.  In Forza 3, you do get cars for leveling up, but you stop leveling up about 1/4 of the way through the game; meanwhile, winning race series only gives you money...not enough money.  I decided that I wanted to own all the cars in the game, since I did pay real money for this opportunity to virtually drive them, and so with 3/4 of the races completed, I tallied up the cars remaining and found I still needed $110,000,000 to buy them all.  Considering that a typical, mid-length race at my advanced level of difficulty only nets about $18,000, that was going to take a while.  Part of this is due to a single vintage Ferrari priced at $20,000,000.  The cars are just too expensive.  It's my own fault for wanting them all, but hey, I should be able to do that.In their attempt to make the game appeal to a wider range of players, Turn 10 also added some unnecessary drama.  There is an entirely repetitive animation at the beginning of each race depicting your car rolling up to the line and revving its engine.  While they do stick to realism here (old cars with soft suspension will bounce when they stop at the line), the revving is tacky, and more critically, it removes your opportunity to bring your RPMs to the correct level for a good launch.  A successful launch off the line is often the key to getting ahead of rivals who may be hard to pass elsewhere.  Forza 3 made this impossible, which is extremely ridiculous considering that an all-new race type is drag racing.  The launch is the MOST critical part of a drag race!!The rewind feature has drawn some criticism from die-hard gamers, but I think it's good.  You really don't have to use it, but I certainly have.  It's easier than restarting a race (which takes a long while) and in long, tedious races it can save you a ton of headaches.  However, it doesn't always work.  Seriously.  Sometimes, when you need it most, it just isn't an option.  The most notable time for me was in the third-to-last lap of an endurance race.  At the end of the long straight, I got incredibly distracted by something else (perhaps my own thoughts) and failed to brake.  Instead of immediately braking and swerving when I realized this, I moved my hand so that I could hit the rewind button.  It did nothing, and by the time I figured that out and got back to the brakes, my car had covered the sand beyond the track and smacked the wall, wrecking its front.  Fortunately, the engine was OK, and I still won the race, but it's good to know you can't always rely on the rewind button.The addition of lousy in-game music is simply a waste of disc space (which is an issue, since you have to install almost 2GB of data on your hard drive in order to play all of the game).Overall, Forza 3 makes some great improvements (rollovers, more cars, awesome graphics, new tracks) over its predecessor, but it is not perfect.  However, it does allow novice and experienced racers alike to jump in and play, and completing the game will take hundreds of hours, making it just as much of a total immersive long-haul experience as its prior installments.\"", "This is the most realistic simulation game yet. Does it leave a bit to be desired, well yes. They are missing a series of cars that should have been in since day one. Well one was in the first Forza. But if you love cars or want to learn how to start to tune your car, well you're luck. This is a good outlet.Unlike many of the other critic here, I accually have custom cars. Three of them and a newer V6 Camry. A Vette, mustang conv, and Camaro. So I have dibbled into alomst everything you can do in a car. So this game makes me realise how fast my cars are.  But I also have expeirence in tuning, so this gives me an edge on the game. But it asks you in the begining how you treat the racing game. So even if you know nothing you can learn.Not the graphics are amazing and the sound is awsome, but as impressive as the beging sequence of a race is, it gets old quick. Also, it keeps you from really getting you RPM in the spot for launch. This really kills the drag racing. But there are a ton of tracks, and cars. Also unlike the Turismo series the cars are cool, and usefull. Most of the GT cars are just different models of the same year. Forza keeps you with the choice stuff. The Hondas are even decent; well as they can get. The physics are spot on, and really nothing can touch it.Now my beefs. No rallys, real stock cars, F1 cars, and sports/muscle/classic cars. Where is the 97 Camaro Z28(feature in every GT), 89-95 ZR1, GTR, 77 Trans Am, 62 Vette fuelie, Porsche 550 spyder(which was in the original), 69 Camaro SS(has gone missing), Ferrari GTB, and 442. But as a odd twist the fox body mustang has made a debut here. It took this many years, but the most popular car for racing in amaerica is finally in a game. Still I want 20s-30s-40s-50s sports cars/race cars/ and luxery cars. But still a good turn out of cars.All in all this game is as good as we can get right now. Lets hope they improve on in these ways,or GT5 will be the best of the bunch period.", "If you like cars, racing, or even making designs and painting cars, then this is PERFECT for you. I myself am a huge car fanatic, and I love racing games, especially simulation racers. I owned Forza 2 on my last 360 and loved it. This game is a huge improvement in every way possible.The gameplay is superb. The different skill levels available are spectacular, and also the physcis are spot on, the car to car physics are remarkable. The livery editor is filled with tons of depth. You can really make some cool stuff in there.There are plenty of car models, over 400 or so. which is a pretty good number. Sure it doesn't really hold a candle to what GT5 will have (1000) but its still definitely a big number. My favorite part is that it includes MY car. Its really great to be able to play using a car identical to mine!If you like racing games GET THIS! If you like cars, GET THIS! Or if you're just really creative, GET THIS! You will not be disappointed.", "\"\"\"Forza Motorsport 3\"\" is one of the best racing games we have played and is generally one of the most fun overall. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Controls; intuitively configured by default+ Car Customization; very flexible system, with most major options being a tweakable by the player+ Racing; challenging, but adjustable levels makes this good for all levels of players+ Graphics; really outstanding, everything from the shadowing and reflections on the cars to background landscape are beautifully rendered+ So Many Cars; there are many brands and models of cars to choose from, more are given to you when you gain levels, can bought in game, or through the \"\"Auction House\"\" (paid with credits earned in the game)Cons -- Long Load Times; two discs, really needs to be installed on the hard drive to reduce the load timeThis has good replay value as well, which is a big plus!Highly Recommended!CFH\"", "I purchased this game at Amazon. The game was really cheap even when it was a brand-new, sealed game. The game arrived timely and in perfect shape. I removed the seal and when I opened it, the two discs where absolutely new. The game also had a coupon to download a few extra cars and tracks, confirming that the game was new, as promised.Cheap price, fast shipping, absolute quality for such a great game. Definitely, Amazon... my very first option for online purchasing.", "Bought this for my kids but also myself because in the video preview it showed a Corvette and that was all I needed to see.", "This was a big improvement over forza 2 i mean the engine sound so realistic, the car detail and much more. I just think the car pack should be free ^^ but anyways this was a great game for ppl whole love driving games.", "I was a big fan of Forza 2.  I played that game up until the release of Forza 3.  With Forza 3, they really did a good job of adding in the things that the community wanted.  The new features are great.  The Storefront is the biggest addition.  The ability to buy desings and logos instead of buying an entire car is huge.  I also like the ability to make movies from your replays.The single player is great as usual.  The calendar and season layout is awesome.  It feels like you're actually racing through a career as a pro driver.The MP is good but they removed the ability to tune your car from the race lobby.  I can't figure out why they would do that.  Now you must have a tune setup saved for your cars if you want to have a tuned car in a MP race.Graphics are great.  The only problem I have is with the tires.  The tires are all too narrow on the wheels.  You can see the lip of the wheels sticking out beyond the tires.  I think they did this to enhance the sidewell flex that they added to the game but it just makes the tires/wheels look funny.Despite these small gripes, it's the best next gen racing game to date.", "I'm not seasoned when it comes to racing games. In fact, the last racing game I owned before Forza 3 was 'Star Wars Episode I: Racer' for the N64. As you would expect, my standards are not very high.What I like about Forza 3 is that it's very detailed without being overwhelming. The mechanics and physics of the game can be as realistic or as 'arcade' as you like. The cars are fun to look at and the upgrades come at a satisifying pace. The game carries itself with class while not taking itself too seriously.It's a quality game worth playing, even with Forza 4 being on the market for a while now.", "i only bought this game because i had played it before and also because it was the first real forza game. it was a huge step forwards from forza 2", "\"I was a die-hard Gran Turismo fan since day one.  I have owned EVERY Gran Turismo game ever.  But I'll probably be skipping Gran Turismo 5......because it'll never measure up to Forza.Racing is a relatively stagnant style of gaming.  Pick a car, pick a track, race.  Hope to place first.  Rinse, wash and repeat.  Only the die-hard automotive / racing enthusiast is going to enjoy a racing game.  But Forza 3 gives the enthusiast SO much more to enjoy - it's simply unbelievable.  At any given time, you could:Run a raceBuy a car - from over 300 available modelsPaint a car, and/or cover it with 4,000 layers of graphicsShare your car designs on your own storefront for people to browse, rate, and buy.Create images using graphic layers for your storefront - like license plates, manufacturer logos, etc.Browse the auction house for some good deals, or to sell one of your own.Search the storefront for photos, replays, graphic designs for specific cars, or separate images to place on any carTune your favorite car for optimum performance - adjusting everything from gear ratios to tire pressuresTake photos of your cars and designs at any of Forza 3's 35+ tracksThis is just a taste of the variety that Forza 3 gives you.  More times than I can remember, I set out to create a simple paint job, and 2 hours later have created a masterpiece that I just HAVE to photograph and share online.  Or a simple test-and-tune of my favorite car has turned into an extensive experiment with Forza's newest ability to add all-wheel-drive to various cars in the lineup.  Also new with this version is the \"\"conversion\"\" which, including the aforementioned all-wheel-drive, allows you to swap engines (though only within the same manufacturers lineup) or choose between turbocharged or supercharged add-ons.  In short, if you can dream it, chances are good Forza 3 will let you create it.The online racing isn't as easy to access - it's a major beef with gamers.  Personally, I'm an older gamer myself, so I started my own discussion on the [...] website and now have over 30 people to race with!  Someone is usually always online, and joining into a race or inviting friends to yours is just as easy as always.There's a few issues: some paint glitches with various cars, the AI controls your engine speed until a half-second before the race starts, and the \"\"livery editor\"\" can get a little confused when handling large numbers of graphic layers.  But these issues hardly hurt the game.  If anything - it shows how good this game is - that's all we can find to complain about!If you enjoy racing - even just a little - you'd probably be pleased with Forza 3.  It connects you to the sport, to your cars, and to each race.  It is easily the best racing game to exist - at least until Forza 4!\"", "\"Forza 3 does a lot of things right, but it's the things it does wrong that left me with a bitter impression.First off, what it does right:-An insane number of cars, over 400 in the box and tons more are downloadable (usually for a fee)-Lots of tracks, 100+ options in the box and more for download (again, usually for a price)-The best customization on consoles, including on-the-fly adjustments that can be made while testing the car, so you don't have to go back and forth between loading screens to test out adjustments-The livery editor is unmatched, letting you paint and decal your cars to a ridiculous degree- if you can dream it, you can build itWith all of this, you'd imagine this is a five-star game. The driving really is technically perfect, and the best simulation you can get on consoles. However, the downsides start to rear their head.First off, the game is totally soulless. 1,000 horsepower monster cars just drift forward, when they should be shaking your driver's teeth loose. The system fails to model the complex bumps and divots that real race tracks have, so the car just floats along. Before the developers patched in an update, your driver didn't even shift when using the first-person mode, the computerized hands just stayed glued to the wheels. This was okay in previous installations in the series since few games could manage that level of realism, but in the time since the last Forza many other titles (Project Gotham racing, GRID...) have better captured incredibly intense bumping and jarring and terror of driving a race car at speed. Driving a million-dollar supercar in Forza 3 is, frankly, just boring.Multiplayer is awful, and this affects the singleplayer game. In most singleplayer or \"\"career\"\" modes, you win a number of prize cars through the game for completing various challenges. Normally, you can resell these prize cars for a good chunk of change, in order to upgrade cars you want. Instead, the developers decided to integrate selling cars into the multiplayer experience, so you can only auction off cars to other people. Since everyone wins the same cars, you're basically stuck with whatever you get and it's much harder to earn money toward things you really want to do in game. The online racing is also awful. As an example, the developers also pulled support for playlists for anyone who wants to race sub-A-class cars, meaning online racing is basically limited to race-tuned and supercars against strangers, there's nothing catering to people who want to race regular stock cars in leagues, which is a massively popular demographic.And the grind. As mentioned, you can't resell prize cars for money, so you're stuck grinding away getting cash from race prizes. Races only really grant money if you finish in the top 3 and specifically in first place, so you'll basically have to win every single race to build money. A normal race might net you up to $20,000 of in-game cash, when there are cars that cost $20 million. That's 1,000 races (and you have to win every single one, while avoiding damage to your car). There are longer races that net more money, but then you could wind up spending literally hours to finish a single race, for only a fraction of the money that you need. It's basically impossible to net all the cars you're going to want, unless you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing and manipulating the online auctions.The damage modeling is laughable. The developers did a great job modeling small bits of damage, like windshields cracking from impacts or bumpers crumpling from a hit, so things look impressive at a glance. However, you quickly learn that all damage is preset- if the front corner takes (x) damage, it will look like crumple effect (y). And if you take a big hit, prepare for the surprise. The front bumper of your car might crumple when you hit a wall, but the chassis will be fine even if you slam facefirst into concrete at 200mph. If you manage to flip your car, it rolls around like a children's toy, and you can hold the left stick to make your car roll itself back over like a turtle shaking its flippers to roll over. This is just plain stupid, and it looks ridiculous in game.So the final impression I was left with, is that that developers spent tens of millions of dollars scanning every lug nut on a car to ensure total accuracy, but then they let you roll your flipped car over with the flick of a magic wand. It's just... dumb. So much money and effort is spent on such a lifeless package. I'm totally underwhelmed by this entry in the series, even though I loved the previous installments.\"", "Ok, so I'm a huge fan of the earlier Grand Turismo series from the Playstation. So to me, that's what expect a driving game to be. I played the previous installment of forza, and was o.k. with it. It got annoying when you had to race stock cars and the AI would run circles around you. The third version is way better than the second version. Its a bit too realistic for my taste and wish it was more arcade-like. But overall, I would recommend this game to racing fans out there.", "i purchased forza 3 months ago on here and i bought it used, and for the price i paid, i thought i was going to get a bad copy with scratches and stuff like that, but when i got it in the mail, it looked brand new. everything was perfect and i even got DLC with it that was unused! the game itself is awesome. you want a realistic sport racing game, the forza series is the way to go, hands down", "I don't own that many games but I had to have this one. The graphics are good but the in-car could be improved on some of the cars. The outside detail is awesome with the reflections. The game is fun but it does have alot of the older Forza 2 tracks on it and makes you feel like it's Forza 2 with add-ons. The drag racing is a nice feature now but it does need some fine tuning as the menus are not that good in the multiplayer mode. It just throws you in any race without even asking what car class you want to run besides AWD or RWD. If you want to run against a stock muscle car class you can't. You end up running it against a Ferrari or something. This only applies to non-friends. You can create your own race and rules. But I do not regret buying it as it's definately a keeper.***TAKE NOTE***Please only install the first CD on your hard drive. DO NOT INSTALL the second CD until you have started the game and as it will ask you if you want to install it from IN GAME. On the forums there are tons of people who have had issues because of this including myself. I installed both CD's and then started the game. Well the game started then asked if I wanted to install the second CD anyway.. I told it yes.. then put the second CD in then right away it asked for the first CD againthen it said the first CD was the wrong CD and the Xbox locked up. It was confused due to the fact I had the 2nd CD installed already. So I deleted the 2nd CD off the drive and installed the 2nd CD IN GAME and it worked perfectly. Instructions probably tell you this but who reads game instuctions right away? lol", "\"After a short 2 year development Forza returns with some impressive changes: a new physics system, about double the tracks, 100 more cars, improved graphics and additions to the difficulty and the storefront. Note that this is a review of only the single player part of the game.Short Review-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay 8/10 - New physics engine adds life to the races, tires play a larger role, weight is much more noticeable and the game is generally more realisticGraphics 8/10 - astonishing detail, interior view, beautiful new tracks set in the mountains, mirroring and reflections are a step up; but maybe not as good as GT5Features 8/10 - a few new difficulty settings (autobrake, manual w/clutch) more car classes, racing season added, auto upgrade feature, loads of new camera angles for replay; ability to buy tuning setups and create art for the vinylRaces and Tracks 7/10 - new, real tracks  add to the simulation and much more variation between tracks, but somewhat redundant racing in the event list, far too many \"\"repeat races\"\" and low level racesCars 9/10 - realism trumps any racing game I've played if not any video game I've played, the look, the feel and the tuning of these cars makes this a true simulatorSound 9/10 - engine sounds are very accurate from the four cylinders to the V-12 engines, each has a distinctive note, superchargers and turbos can be heard as well as crashes and tires gripping, very believable--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay 8 of 10Let me begin by saying that the racing in Forza 3 is not so much revolutionary as it is evolutionary; as you might expect with two games on the same console. The physics worked well for Forza 2 and they've added realism here as opposed to reinventing the wheel, no pun intended. You do essentially the same thing as you would have done in Forza 2. The racing hasn't changed. The cars and tracks have.There are a few essential things that have been changed which directly effect gameplay in Forza 3. Not the least of which is the rewind button (or whatever it is being called). It is exactly what you think - you can rewind the race many times throughout the race in five second intervals. It's very handy if you happen to be racing an endurance race and you accidentally forget to make a turn on the last lap. The second major piece of the change in gameplay is the physics system. As you might guess, it's improved. Cars now have the ability to flip over completely (multiple times even), driving is much more dependent on weight, tires can lose grip while the car shifts from side to side or on sharp turns and racing seems to be based much more on the tuning of the suspension.I've heard complaints about cars being able to flip on the game. First, if you don't believe a car will flip at even low speeds go on your favorite video website and search for car accidents. Secondly, the driving elements in determining if a car will flip are: mass (really rotational inertia) and velocity. Put those together and you get momentum. There are many other forces in play for sure, but can be considered negligible. In other words, a heavy thing going fast gives high momentum and energy and the energy HAS to go somewhere. If it happens to run into another relatively heavy thing going fast, the cars could flip. And if flipping is possible, everything else is just not as difficult to believe.The physics system is amazing, but it was already really good for Forza 2. It's been said that with all the assists off, even the slow cars are fun to drive because you really notice the difference between them. This is true to a certain extent, but I'd have to disagree with the idea that the slow cars are fun. I found much of the early races in the Event List to be repetitive and more like driving on a highway.The AI is pretty impressive. I honestly can't say just how good they are because I normally am far ahead of the pack by the end of the first lap. But, they certainly do react to you. If you try to take the inside corner, sometimes they'll cut you off or sometimes they won't if it could cause an accident. If you try to hit them or make them spin out, the AI will fight back and adjust to stay straight. They're pretty good at it. And when you play on hard, they'll manage to complete perfect laps while avoiding you. If you own the game and aren't getting enough of a challenge, turn off just the ABS, use manual shifting and put the opponent difficulty on hard. You won't believe how much skill it takes to manage braking while at high speeds without an anti-lock brake system.Graphics: 8 of 10Visuals are considerably improved in pretty much every aspect. I will admit however, you really do need to own an HDTV to notice a substantial difference. Instead of describing the cars, I'll explain the differences between the two games. In Forza 2 the cars were all dimensionally correct; details down to the brake calipers and slotted rotors were shown; cars had a reflective quality where you could see the sky in the paint. But generally they looked too \"\"CGI-ish.\"\" In Forza 3 Turn 10 went to mind-boggling levels of clarity and detail. Now there is a new view inside the car where the interior can be seen in great detail; the headlight show clear 3-D aspects.The headlights, in fact reflect light differently than the metal which is just like a real car. In fact if you're really observant you can see the design on the tire sidewall. Paint looks like real car paint as the sheen changes depending on where you see it from. Chrome just looks amazing, it's hard to even describe how close to reality they came on this. This is the first game I've ever played that I think even I could confuse with reality if just taking a glance at it. The new tracks are gorgeous, especially \"\"Camino Viejo De Montserratt,\"\" which is a track set on the side of a mountain overlooking a serene lake. The artists even took the time to put in small outcroppings of grass sticking up from the ground.  One of the most unbelievable parts about the visuals is that the game runs at 60 frames per second which gives an ultra smooth animation to the action.To the dissenters of the graphics, I won't discredit your opinion because it's all subjective. However, if you don't see a noticeable change, I'd recommend playing it on a proper HDTV with an HD connection. I'm doubtful the game will strike you as impressive if you're running it with anything less than component cables. And if that doesn't work, you might need glasses.Features: 7 of 10The number of features has gone up to a certain extent. Something new on the difficulty setting called an autobrake allows even the most casual or driving challenged people to be competitive. Another really interesting part of the difficulty is the manual with clutch shifting arrangement, which is on the advanced racer end of the spectrum. Just like in a real car you need to let off the gas, press in the clutch and then get the revs to match the next gear. Sounds difficult on a game controller doesn't it? It is. Unfortunately it's almost useless without a racing wheel that has a clutch because you can easily ruin your powertrain by not shifting properly. It doesn't get much more realistic than this.The player's storefront is a really nice aspect of the game. Gamers can take photos of their car, videos of races and even create art to sell for credits. Advanced racers can help out others by selling their tuning setups for certain cars. All of the features from Forza 2 are here with quite a few new ones. What impresses me most is that the game caters to essentially all types of racers. If you're more of an arcade racer, turn on autobrake and the full racing line and just gas it. If you're a super serious simulator, turn off all the assists and you really get to feel the essence of the car, the weight, the acceleration.Another of the less looked upon parts is the presentation. It is a lot cleaner looking and is somewhat easier to use. The appearance and even the sounds resemble Gran Turismo 4's interface. Another feature for the more casual racing enthusiast allows a class upgrade or downgrade. Here's how it works: let's say you want to enter a class B race and your car is an class E; you can have the automated Forza 3 tuner to pick out all your parts and bring it up to the class you need so that it is competitive (which of course costs money) or you can have it downgrade your car so you can race in one of the more restrictive races. It is a pretty ingenious idea. Instead of spending 5-10 minutes picking out parts and then maybe another hour tuning your car, you can just race right away. This is another one of those things that I don't use myself, but would be great for many.Races and Tracks 7 of 10Unfortunately this is the Achilles' heel of the game and was with Forza 2. Turn 10 did a wonderful job trying to integrate as many types of cars as possible in so that you not only get a feel for the slower cars first, but so that the vast majority of the cars in the game are used. The setup is very similar to Forza 2, however the hitch is the restrictions put on the races. Many of the lower class races have restrictions such as \"\"only stock\"\" or car must be F class or less than 200 hp for example.One of the earlier races is a Yaris race. For those who don't know what a Yaris is; it's a very small Japanese economy car. I don't know about anybody else, but I don't consider this a race car or even a sports car. In fact there are at least 10-15 cars I think shouldn't be in the game. And if you want to totally finish the game, you or your hired driver will have to race at least six races in this car. Another problem is there is just flat out too many low class and \"\"repeat\"\" races. There must be 15 events (sets of races) which include F class cars or F class Euro cars. This makes the beginning of the game incredibly boring. And if you're a little OCD like me, you'll want to finish the earlier parts of the game first. I don't care how you spin it. F class cars are boring to drive.New tracks and track setups have really added more intrigue to the game. Now there are about 20 track locations and each location has multiple track maps making for around 100 different tracks. They've also added ,  and 1 mile drag strips and a ton of new speed rings. Most of the old tracks are back with a few new ones - Motegi, Sedona, Rally Di Positano, Amalfi Coast. There is still no Monaco Gran Prix, which is the one I was hoping for. And as I had feared, they removed even more of the imaginary tracks that were really fun to drive. Overall, I think the tracks have improved but with the downside of losing some of the fun-to-drive fake locations.Cars 9 of 10The cars in Forza 3 are by far the most realistic entity I've yet seen in a game; from the graphics to the tiny little details these are a marvel of computer programming and dedication to accuracy. Each car is so close to the actual car in so many ways. Light cars brake more easily. Rear wheel drive cars spin out. But each spins out in a different way. A muscle car loses complete control, whereas a Maza Miata  will spin out usually at a really high speed. No two cars are alike - literally.You might notice when your car rolls up to the start line at the beginning of the race that the front end dips just a tad because of the forward momentum. Every minute detail of a car was enlisted into the game. A lot of these things many will never notice, but the people at Turn 10 took the time to bring a level of authenticity I've not seen before in a game.My only issue with the cars is: I'm pretty sure there was some \"\"quid pro quo\"\" going on with the car manufacturers. In other words, after talking with the car manufacturers there was most likely some conversations that went like this \"\"we'll let you use car X if you agree to also put in car Y.\"\" Because of this, in the game there are boring economy cars which don't even belong in a racing simulator much less be given the honor of having their own race.Sound 9 of 10Considering this games focuses on ultra-realism, sounds definitely need to be accurate and they really are spot on with this game. Most of the cars sound very similar to their real life counterpart. They managed to get a true V8 sound and not just one version. Anybody who knows anything about V8s is that no two sound alike. A BMW V8 from their E92 M3 will not sound like a 426 Hemi on a Challenger. Six cylinder engines sound very good from what I can surmise. Even the four cylinders have a different tone for each car. This just harkens back to the idea of no two cars being the same, even from the same manufacturer. Tire squeals, crashes, blow off valves, superchargers and even shifting noises are all present in Forza 3. If you listen really carefully, you can hear the click of the gear lever changing gears, which shows an incredible attention to detail. The sounds from the game are realistic, seem accurate and take you one step closer to being on the track.In conclusion, this game is the best racing simulator out right now and is possibly the most realistic game I've ever played. Unfortunately, that means it isn't necessarily the most fun I've had in a game. But if you're a car enthusiast or a racing fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Forza doesn't just do cars well; it does just about everything well which is why I'd rate it a 9 out of 10 overall.\"", "I finished playing this game 2 weeks before I bought Gran Turismo 5. I know it's not fair to review this now b/c this game has been out for a while now compared to GT5. This game is really fun. Very well made and really nice graphics. Just not as nice as GT5 and not as deep either, as GT5 has many different license tests and driving challenges in addition to various races. However, I did like the car damage aspect for Forza which is missing in GT5. Also, I won this game with a controller, as a driving wheel is not completely necessary. I'm glad to have played Forza 3 before GT5. Overall a great game in it's time and I look forward to playing Forza 4!", "\"If you've ever dreamt of owning a gorgeous sports car, this is the game of you. If you want thrills and absolute extreme speed, destruction and absurdity (like inBurnout Paradise), it isn't. It's a very good looking racing simulator, with emphasis on owning, styling, tuning and racing as in real life. The amount of detail is striking (cars look to be modeled down to the nuts and bolts), but it isn't the greatest \"\"party\"\" game, when (locally) only two players race around in a lifelike environment. It's very simply about creating a dream garage of nice cars, taking good care of them and putting them on the track. The cars are all yours just as you made them, but if you aren't a car or racing aficionado, it does become a rather dull experience. The strongest side of the game is playing it on a big high definition television, and watching the sun shine off the chassi of your very own Ferrari, not any overtly thrilling racing matches.\"", "\"Forza was a great game. Forza 2 was a good one that should have been great. It had amazing graphics and physics, no arguing against that. But it made the same mistake Ferrari F355 Challenge on the Dreamcast did. It was too dang hard. The thing about simulations is that while they are interesting for exploring the possibilities in the real world without real-world consequences (wrecking cars that cost millions isn't something you can do any day of the week for real), they also tend to be a bit low on the fun factor once the novelty of the realism wears off (unless you are just an incurable realism fanatic). Thankfully, the creators of Forza learned their lesson and made this more than just a great sim, but a great game.If there is one thing Microsoft does well, it is stealing. Added to the already formidable Gran Turismo-ish simulation physics and real-world feel and the in-cockpit views borrowed from Project Gotham, we now have the rewind ability from the amazing GRID. When you take the variable difficulty of Forza, correct the ridiculous braking of Forza 2 (with brakes turned to 200% I still regularly slammed into walls), and add in some brightly colored graphics and brief exciting tracks (maybe a suggestion from GRID and need for Speed Shift) to replace the drab boring tracks from Forza 2. The rewinds go a loooong way to ease the irritation of crashing at the end of the final lap I experienced so many, many times in Forza 2.I can't say anything about the online features of the game, as I don't have an Internet connection at home. The garage and upgrade features are largely unchanged, but I am deeply grateful for the automatic upgrade/downgrade option so that I don't have to tweak a car endlessly to qualify for a race. As in the second Forza it's nice to be able to hire a driver to do the races you don't like, and the experience system for cars and drivers goes a long way to keep you playing. The new Touge events and other new styles are nice, but once again it feels like Forza is just playing catch-up to GRID (I saw the EXACT same Touge track in that game, though it is nice to see it in a more real-world light).In yet another move to copy GRID (and a very welcome one), the A.I. cars no longer race in perfect lines, but actually overshoot corners and spin-out and wreck from time-to-time. It goes a long way to making the game feel more like a race event and less like a cold calculating simulation.The presentation side of the game is a trade-off. While the menu interface is lovely, bright, and colorful, it also takes longer for menus, races, and events to load than any other racing game I have ever seen. I kid you not, there is actually a \"\"Menu Loading\"\" screen that you will see every couple of minutes. While the graphics are truly outstanding, the extensive loading is the price that you pay, and especially when you are racing a lot of short events, they can start to seem a bit much.The game requires a very large install, so make sure you have room on your hard drive (it even comes with a second DVD full of content you need to load the first time you play). And if, like me, you don't have Internet....you are going to be irritated to find that there are track and car packs included that are download only. That right. In a move doubtless designed to highly discourage buying the game used, instead of coming with a disc loaded with extra cars and tracks, the game comes with download codes for the content.This is a beautiful game. And you can tell by the demo that it has a much more colorful and generally fun atmosphere than the last Forza. If you like your realism, but don't like it to be punishing you will probably enjoy this game. If you enjoyed Forza and Forza 2 it's a must-buy. It is in my opinion, the best racing simulation in the world today...until Gran Turismo 5 comes out at least.\"", "Never really been a huge fan or Forza, Need for Speed, or the Gran Turismo games, but they can be enjoyable for a little while. Basically games like this are for people who just wanna drive, which can be quite fun, yet takes a special person to really just sit and have a mid paced race. No, its not Motorstorm, or Burnout, its just a beautiful looking game with all kinds of customizable cars to unlock and have fun with. I played the demo, went through it a couple times, had some fun and watched the replay, enjoyed it, then deleted it. I think games like these should be cheaper or just made downloadable on consoles. The graphics are definitely top notch, and some of the best looking on any console to date, hense why it was up for best graphics technical this year. Also when you hit things the dents stay, or scruff up your car which makes for a realistic ride overall. I can only recommend this game to fans of car and driver magazine, because basically you make your dream car, and have a little race with it, thats pretty much it. So for the fans of driving its great, for hardcore racing fans, stick with Burnout, Motorstorms, or even the off road seris of games. Still a decent ride though."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.020259490236639977, 0.0011817687191069126, 0.0777105763554573, 0.07143514603376389, 0.0012447778135538101, 0.08637365698814392, 0.06319620460271835, 0.09394155442714691, 0.0031739671248942614, 0.0015151218976825476, 0.0812951847910881, 0.024010630324482918, 0.01566268876194954, 0.049019958823919296, 0.0828913226723671, 0.027250071987509727, 0.12531393766403198, 0.011445647105574608, 0.08199086785316467, 0.02412089705467224, 0.056966494768857956]]}
