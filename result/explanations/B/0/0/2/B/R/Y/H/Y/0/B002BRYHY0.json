Resonance of Fate is a Tri-Ace offering, so if you know what that means, you know what to expect. If not, that's OK - what it means is that you generally have an interesting and original battle system, a compelling story concept, slow but (usually) methodical development, and a ton of grinding. In fact, this game's battle system is actually incredible, but the story development pays for it, as it is woeful. Also, grinding has been mostly cut back this time around (at least by Tri-Ace standards). If that's your cup of tea, you're in the right place. If not, well, look elsewhere.I won't even bother explaining the story - your best bet is to watch the opening movies (BOTH of them - another appears after the title screen), and then wait until around chapter 14 (out of 16 chapters) to see what's going on. By then, you probably won't care.THE GOOD:BATTLE MECHANICS: I have to confess, it took me three separate tries and almost a year and a half before I finally got into this game, but when you get it, it's great. Basically, battles are as follows: you have machine guns and handguns. Machine guns do what is called \"\"scratch damage,\"\" which is temporary damage. Hand guns do permanent damage, and convert \"\"scratch damage\"\" into permanent damage as well. The (obvious) catch: machine guns do a ton more damage than hand guns, but scratch damage heals over time (sometimes very quickly).[Author's Note: I realize it is absurd to think of a world where machine guns do essentially fake damage, but if realism is your thing, you might want to leave now. We have only scratched the surface of the absurdity.]There are also throwing weapons, such as grenades, but the majority of the time, this is your set-up. Enemies also do damage to you, but always in the form of scratch damage. However, when your life bar is completely depleted, you lose gems known as \"\"bezels\"\". Lose all of your bezels, and all damage becomes permanent damage. The (not-so-obvious) catch: bezels are also the currency to fire off your so-called \"\"hero actions,\"\" which is the ticket to multiple attacks and massive damage, since you can \"\"charge\"\" your weapon without fear of reprisal. And of course, there is the \"\"tri-attack,\"\" which must be charged, also costs bezels, but allows all three members of your party to attack simultaneously.Sounds confusing? Well, it is. Thankfully, there is a tutorial inside of the arena. Not so thankfully, the arena is outside the town, which means that if you get caught in an attack, you will probably have no clue what is going on. Even when you get to the tutorial, the explanations are often so vague that you will find yourself going online to see what they're really talking about (the \"\"smackdown\"\" attack, which is mostly useless, was hell on me). However, once you get it, it's a joy to behold. While I will stop short of saying that battle is strategic, it certainly requires thought, and you will die more than once (probably in the first chapter, no less). But Tri-Ace has never disappointed me with a battle system, and this is no exception. However, not unlike Star Ocean, it is a real pain to switch characters.CUSTOMIZATION: This game has a ton of customization options. First (and definitely of lesser importance), you can dress your characters up in a wide variety of ways. You can dye their hair, give them glasses, give them a casual look or a work look, etc. Moreover, your choices will be reflected in the cutscenes. If I have one gripe, it's that these costumes are noting more than aesthetic - there are no changes to character parameters. So, e.g., although a pair of boots might say that it protects you from monsters, it doesn't.More important is the customization of the gun. Again, the game does a poor job of explaining the system, but once you get it, you can have many customization options at your fingertips. In fact, this has an added bonus: different guns can customize in different ways, so you can actually get a lot of use out of early guns even when later guns appear. Of course, the actual customization is absurd. Why put one sight on your gun when you can have...10 sights? (I am not kidding, BTW - you can easily have 10 sights on your gun.) When affixing barrels to guns, you might actually hook them to...a handgrip? And why would you affix handgrips in multiple locations, anyway? It doesn't make a lick of sense, but if you can get over that, it's a ton of fun. Of course, some parts require rare elements which must be won (randomly) in battle, while others require many, MANY wins in the Arena.If I have one gripe regarding curstomization, it's the lack of a \"\"try before you buy\"\" option. Sometimes, affixing a part to your gun is a confusing process, requiring perfect alignment of 2 or even three separate fixtures. However, you can't actually see your gun when you buy or create parts, so you will either go back and forth between shop and menu to determine the best fit, or else just guess at it, and hope it works.OVERWORLD MECHANICS: A lot of people don't like the overworld in Resonance of Fate. I am not one of them. The idea is as follows: everyone lives on a giant tower, which requires energy for activation. In order to activate the tower, you place different \"\"hexes\"\" on the overworld, which will energize them. The world is completely made up of these hexes, and the hexes you use to activate the world have different shapes and sizes. If your hex doesn't fit on the world, you can't use it. Also, sometimes you will need colored hexes to activate cities (once again, absurdity rules. Are these cities completely inactive before you energize them? But then...why are there people living there?) I'm making this sound more confusing than it is - it's actually a pretty simple system, although there is one major confusion (more later). Sometimes when you activate a part of the overworld, you will get a treasure chest. This can range from a first aid item (easily the most useless thing in the game - if you are using first aid items, you're in trouble), to special grenades or rounds for your gun (very useful) to Bezel shards (obviously the most useful of all).There are also objects called \"\"terminals\"\" in the overworld. By using colored hexes, you can unlock these, and later, activate them. This is actually confusing, though - sometimes you'll try to place a colored hex, only to be told that it's impossible. That's because you need to create a colored energy station. I can't tell you how long that took me to figure out. However, once you get it, you can link terminals together to produce devastating effects. For example, I was able to link terminals to the Arena, and would get 3x experience, 6x item drop rate, and 4x rare item drop rate in every battle I fought!THE BAD:STORY: As I mentioned before, Tri-Ace is known for glacial development in story, although the concepts are often good. Here, they fail on both sides. I thought the concept looked promising after the opening movies (particularly the second one). A church that rules the world, but hides a secret that could destroy it? Sounds like a winner to me. Unfortunately, that's not exactly how things go. In fact, I am at the last boss in the game (only because I am doing a lot of grinding for the plat), and I still can't really tell you the main focus here. And a major part of that problem is that the developers do NOTHING to explain this story. The game itself consists of 16 chapters + 1 prologue. These chapters consist of some of the most mundane tasks imaginable. You might bring a rock to a cardinal. You might find a statue in a forest. You might take another statue into another forest. Even as late as chapter 13(!), you are doing silly things (a Christmas party, in which you shoot kids with presents as they run up to you and stun you). It's just so...stupid. Thankfully, you probably won't care because of the battle system (while the tasks are idiotic, the bosses keeping you from these tasks are anything but, and often provide incredible challenge), but come on. We can do better.RANDOM ENCOUNTERS: I love the battle system, but it has one flaw - it takes time. That's fine when I'm in a dungeon - I'm meeting new enemies and developing ways to deal with them. But in the overworld? It gets old. Fast. Often, you'll find yourself fighting the same enemies you fought in the initial chapters (the \"\"Closed Road\"\" hexes are a different story, as the enemies actually level up sensibly). Sometimes, you can end a battle fast by attacking the leader. However, often, you'll have to defeat every enemy on the screen. Remember that after almost every tun, each enemy will get to attack you. Often, they have separate animations, which really makes battle drag.So anyway, it's basically a Tri-Ace game. You've got your great battle system. You've got your crazy difficulty spikes. You've got your story that goes nowhere for hours (actually, this is worse than usual). It really depends on what you want from a game. I love it, though.\"", "\"\"\"Resonance of Fate\"\" slipped out right after \"\"Final Fantasy 13\"\" without a lot of fanfare, which is a shame as there is a risk of it slipping under the radar and disappearing into bargain-bin hell. Plus it's also pretty good.The game is set in a future world where everybody lives in a tall metal tower due to the earth having become uninhabitable for some reason, and you play as a team of three youngsters called Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron (just the usual names for teenagers of course!), who start the game as guns for hire, taking on missions to mend broken bridges or deal with rebel bandits causing trouble around the tower. Things start slowly as you explore the locations and fight various gangsters and goblins, but right from the start the battle system really shines.Well I should say it does not shine immediately, because with no in-game tutorial, your first battles are going to be an exercise in bewilderment as it's impossible to fathom them out unaided. Luckily you are told that there is a battle arena near town where you can practise, and in here is a tutorial (thank god!), so I headed here as soon as I knew where it was.The game's appeal rests solely on the battle system, so it's important you know what it is all about. You have the same three characters throughout the whole game, and random battles see you face up against enemies of all sorts. The simplest thing to do is run around the battle field and fire at an enemy of your choice with your gun (it's all about guns in this game). First thing to know is that there are two types of firearms available: Machine guns, which cause very heavy damage but it's only temporary and recovers over time, and handguns, which cause very light damage, but turn any amount of temporary damage permanent as soon as they hit. So the idea is that you share out the types of guns, so (say) Leanne will fire a whole load of machine gun fire at an enemy and then Zephyr will go straight after her with his handgun, and convert that damage to permanent before it wears off. You can also hold your aim on an enemy while the gun powers up, which is a balance between waiting for the gun to charge up and firing before the enemy attacks, as any attack will make you lose all of your charge-up...and you only get one shot per turn. Got that part? Good, because there's a lot more, and if this is all you do, the game will get very boring quite fast.The real fun of the battles comes from using Hero Actions. Put simply, at the start of every action you have a limited number of orange gems on a guage. For the cost of one gem, you can do a charge across the entire length (or width) of the screen, and while you do this mad dash you can fire at the enemies as many times as you like before you come to a stop. It's great fun and of course can cause loads of damage, which is why it's not free to do - and you start the game with a very limited number of gems - three, I think, but you (very gradually) earn more throughout the game. You have to use these gems wisely, as if you spend all three doing these Hero Runs, you will go into panic mode, which almost always leads to a Game Over as you basically can't do anything. So you have to make sure each gem you spend is worth it. If you cause enough damage on a Hero Run or cause any part of the enemy (armour, usually) to break off, you earn a gem back, so you can see how strategic play is required to get lots of running in without running out of gems.This in itself is fun enough, but the true play experience of \"\"Resonance of Fate\"\" really comes from the Tri-Attack. This attack can only occur after you have done a succession of Hero Runs, during which time the characters have crossed paths at least once and have ended up in a vaguely triangular formation. Once you have a few successful runs in the bank you can unleash the Tri-Attack, which sees all three characters start running AT THE SAME TIME, all ready to fire at the enemy when you give the command. The camera starts weaving wildly across the screen as the characters leap and spin across the terrain (you can make them jump), firing and spinning through the air and shouting heroic cries like \"\"Now you're gonna get it!\"\" and so on. It all looks fantastic, and I never tired of it, in fact as soon as I got the hang of it I used Tri-Attacks in every single battle. It takes a lot of concentraion to plan each one, as you have to make sure your characters are well positioned on the ground so that they can all target the enemy, and they can all run without bashing into any walls or obstacles (the terrain often has things like ramps and pillars all over the place), which will end the run for whoever comes a cropper.Trust me, if you learn this battle system you will derive hours of fun from this game. Which is good because \"\"Resonance of Fate\"\" has no plot! I'm not kidding, to me it just seemed like I got given missions and targets to achieve and I just went around doing them, without any reason or motive other than being paid. The so-called story seems to revolve around the higher classes of the tower experimenting with the mortality of the regular inhabitants, but this is very hard to figure out. Most if the time the cast just mumble pondeorus phrases like \"\"What have I done?\"\" or \"\"Why am I still alive? It would be better if I was dead!\"\" and all that type of thing, few of which ever make sense. So do not play this game for the story!It's also not an easy game but to be honest, this is probably going to be because gamers are not using the Tri-Attack properly, and if you master this, you will win pretty much everything. Some bosses ramp up the challenge quite significantly, especially when they can only be damaged from one angle, so aiming Hero Runs in the right direction (so you can fire at their backs before they turn round, for example) becomes paramount.Apart from the battles, there is also the fun of powering up the guns. Instead of finding new weapons, you buy or find attachemnts for the ones you have throughout the game, and upgrading a gun becomes a mini-game, as you are required to fit all the additional barrels, bullet clips and sights onto the gun by means of a 2D grid diagram, which means arranging as many as you can on the grid and leaving as few unfilled spaces as possible (all the attachments are a different shape). Hours of geeky fun!And finally, you also have another mini-game in the world map, which you can only traverse by laying down tiles side by side to \"\"fill in\"\" the empty map. The tiles are shaped like jigsaw peices so you have to have enough of all the different shapes in order to successfully fill up entire floors of the tower, so this in itself is another fun part to play with.So to finish, you should absolutely buy this game and experience the very dynamic battle system. You might enjoy getting to know the three characters (you can even dress them up!), but don't expect to get too attached as the story is so vague that I finished the game without a clue what had happened. I just know that I won - Hooray! And a lot of fun it was too.\"", "A common criticism of modern games is that they are just too easy. Two decades ago unlimited lives and saving checkpoints would have sounded absurd to those who had to memorize level layouts and perfectly timing jumps and attacks (see Mega Man, Castlevania, Metroid, etc.). Now, those kind of features are expected, indeed it seems as those games that don't hold our hands are critized as being somehow poorly designed or flawed in their execution. That is what makes this game stand out. If you are one of those people who believe that games have lost their edge or aren't nearly challenging enough, then this game is precisely for you. I will warn you that the combat controls and heavily strategic nature of the game make it prohibitive difficult. As such, it should come as no surprise that many professional reviewers give the game relatively low marks (I believe some years ago X-Play gave this game a 2/5).The game is built around a combat system which is reminiscent of Valkyrie Chronicles. The game combines elements of real-time and turn-based battles. In explanation, the game may seem easy, but in execution it is incredibly complex. The combat system does take a long time to get used to, but after you get the hang of it, I think fans of strategic gaming will really enjoy it.Beyond a complicated combat system, the only drawbacks the game has are the overuse of the same enemy designs, and as it type of most JRPGs, the plot is basically nonsensical. However, I think the look of the game is pretty interesting (sort of a steam punk victorian era). Additionally, I thought some of the side quests were really fun (especially when the characters dress up as reindeer and elves, and then deliver presents to children). Finally, while the characters aren't very developed, most of the dialogue and delivery of the voice actors during the cut scenes are hilarious.Overall, I think this is a great game for old-school JRPG fans who want a more challenging experience. However, make no mistake the learning curve for this game is ridiculous.", "\"Noted RPG developer tri-Ace continue their work of creating excellent role-playing games with Resonance of Fate (RoF). In Japan, this game is also called End of Eternity. Not only does RoF follow the traditional RPG formula in many key ways, but it also reinvents how it is presented with a unique story and complex battle system. Unlike new arrivals, such as Final Fantasy XIII, RoF does not try to appeal to the mainstream. Instead, it is an RPG, not unlike Demon's Souls, in that the game appeals to the more hardcore gamer.Story: The main story of Resonance of Fate centers on three characters, Vashyron, Zephyr, and Leanne. The game doesn't really do anything too innovative in the story content itself, but the presentation is unique among most role-playing games. Unlike most RPG's where the story is doled out bit by bit over the course of a chapter or act, RoF's core story only occurs at the beginning or end of a chapter, and following a major boss battle. Thus, you can finish chapters at your own pace without the feeling of being dragged along by the story. This method of storytelling does have the benefit of allowing the gamer to pace themselves, but with several hours between story sequences, it feels a little disjointed and difficult to remember previous events. The story content itself is largely unremarkable, and to avoid spoiling it, I'm not going to mention it, but RoF does diverge from standard RPG fare in one respect: Humor. Like all Japanese RPG's, RoF can be a touch melodramatic and over-the-top at times, however, there were several moments where I couldn't help but laugh out loud at some of the (Intentionally) funny moments. This is a major shift from RPG's that take themselves very seriously. Each of the characters have an important role to play and the story would unravel if their backgrounds were not reasonably fleshed out.Gameplay: Resonance of Fate is meant for the more hardcore RPG players and it shows in how the game is played. The giant tower-world of Basel, think of the Tower of Babel only larger and steam punk, is where all of the game takes place and is split into 12 levels. Each level is a map covered in hexes. Initially, you are restricted to certain levels and cannot access the lower, and more dangerous, levels. From the beginning, not every energy hex on the map is open for exploration, you must use white hexes to open up the area, which can be obtained from battles. Some towns and dungeons are also locked using special colored hexes which are rarer. All energy hexes are specially shaped and you can only place them on the map in areas where the whole hex will cover an area and not fall outside the map. This adds a whole puzzle element to map exploration. If you unlock every hex on a level, you get the ability to warp back to your main base on level four from any station hex you construct on that level. Station hexes are bought using five colored hexes in guilds and allow you to save your game, rest, and head back to base. On the map, you will also find terminals which bestow special benefits on the party, such as being able to cause extra fire damage or increased experience. These terminals can only be activated using colored hexes and require a certain number of colored hexes to activate. As you lay down these colored hexes to activate the terminals, they can be chained with other terminals to increase the benefits but also over dungeons. If you enter a dungeon or have a random encounter on a colored hex which has activated terminals connected to it, you gain the benefit in battle. Terminals play a vital role in many battles and make or break some boss encounters. Towns and dungeons are similar in that you access them from the main level map, but how they are presented differ. Towns have NPC's you can interact with and purchase items from, along with a static camera, while dungeons have rotatable cameras and are like mini-hex maps, similar to the world map but on a smaller scale. RoF is entirely mission-based. The story and side missions are all lumped together in one screen so you know what is needed. Side, or guild missions, are obtained from the Hunter's Guild which releases up to three missions at once on a bulletin board for hunters, you, to perform. These missions can start out very easy, such as a standard delivery request, and can range to very difficult battles with boosted mini-bosses. Completing these guild missions gets you in-game currency and items, but also increases your hunter rank. For every one hundred levels of rank, you get a special item from the guild. RoF also does not have a deep economy even though you do have shops that provide basic equipment. The vast majority of your equipment comes from crafting, whose parts come from quests, broken down loot, or loot itself. You can customize your weapons any way you desire, though, the in-game weapon does not change in appearance, only the blueprint does. By themselves, the weapons don't do much damage, requiring you to customize them. This means that acquiring new weapons is more about the connection points and possible upgrades, rather than raw damage potential. You cannot simply add whatever part you desire to a gun since they have connection points which can restrict you to certain add-ons. Initially, you must take into consideration a weapon's weight as your characters can only equip so much, but this becomes less important as the game progresses. Another interesting, and somewhat superfluous, aspect is the degree in which you can customize your character's appearance. Each character has a wardrobe, which can be expanded at a boutique or exploring, each outfit style, called \"\"A\"\" and \"\"B\"\", has eight or so sections with items you can customize, from shirts, to pants, to holsters, to boots, even hair and eye color can be customized. So, if you want Leanne to run around Basel wearing a French maid's outfit, you can do it. If you want Zephyr to wear a reindeer costume, you've got it, too. If you want Vashyron to look like a gun slinging biker with all leather, black hair, and futuristic sunglasses, you've got that as well. Costumes don't impart any gameplay advantages, but watching Leanne dressed up as one of Santa's helpers tossing Molotov Cocktails in battle, is priceless.Combat System: Normally, I would include this in the gameplay section, but, due to the complexity, this warrants its own section. Random encounters, compressed dungeon maps (These are dungeon's without any hexes but interconnected battle arenas), and standard dungeon encounters are where battles take place. For the majority of the game, you have all three characters active at once and the battle occurs in an arena environment. Anyone who has played Valkyria Chronicles would get the system very quickly as it shares many of the same elements. Each character is equipped with some sort of gun, either a hand gun or machine gun, along with an equipment case, such as a grenade box or first aid kit. Machine guns cause massive scratch damage in many situations, but cannot outright kill an enemy. Hand guns cause minor direct damage while converting scratch damage into direct damage. Scratch damage heals over time but direct damage is permanent. Therefore, in most battles, you should send a machinegun holder out to cause scratch damage on an enemy one turn, followed by a handgun holder the next. A magazine case is available for the machine gun and can cause status effects on an enemy. This becomes increasingly irrelevant as your characters are able to dual wield later in the game. Both grenades and handguns can cause gauge breakage to an enemy, more on that later. During battle, enemies can only perform actions when you do, thus you can go slow and plan out an attack. To perform an action, your character must \"\"charge\"\" their attack. The speed at which a charge happens is determined by the weapon, it's add-ons, and distance from an enemy. As the weapon charges, the damage potential increases exponentially and the possibility of combat skills activating increases, which are obtained during level up, while a timer decreases. The timer indicates the amount of time a character has during a given turn, if they aren't doing anything or stop charging a weapon, the timer, and all other battlefield activity stops. The enemy can interrupt your charge by firing at you, and you can do the same, however, it seems as though you stopping an enemy from charging their weapon is more rare. At the bottom of the screen, you have the hero gauge, which can be expanded by defeating bosses or exploring the map. The hero gauge is vital, it allows you to perform hero actions and recover if your character is overwhelmed by scratch damage. Hero actions are similar to standard attacks with a few exceptions. First, you are entirely invincible and uninterruptable. Second, time slows down while the charge rate increases. You do have a maximum amount of charge you can have, which is tied to your level in a given weapon, but it is very possible to have two or more attacks that are fully maxed out on charge. Third, you can jump over an enemy or run past them. Some enemies have protective body armor that protects their main hit point (HP) gauge, firing from the ground hits only the armor facing the character while airborne attacks hit all armor equally. From the ground, it is also possible to launch the enemy into the air and juggle them, canceling their turn but also opening up the possibility of a bonus shot which removes the restriction on the amount of charge you can have and vastly increases the amount of loot an enemy drops. While the enemy is in the air, you can jump up from the ground and join them. If you fire your weapon from a higher altitude, you can cause a \"\"Smackdown\"\" which is similar to spiking an American football. Performing a smackdown increases the amount of loot they drop and dazes them for a few moments. The hero gauge will also \"\"revive\"\" a character that has taken too much scratch damage. If one of your characters is saturated with this type of damage, the hero gauge breaks in half, you lose half of the remaining colored bezels on the gauge, and fragments of it scatter on the battlefield. Those fragments can be reacquired after the battle or during the battle. However, if the enemy obtains a bezel shard, they recover hit points. If you really mess up and the hero gauge breaks again, or you don't have any colored bezels remaining, you enter a critical condition. During this state all damage done to your squad increases, the charge rate decreases, and all damage is direct HP damage. If you lose all your HP (Hit points), it is game over. You can escape from battle or pay a fee and retry, but if you escape, you leave the battlefield and remain in the condition in which you left it until you arrive at your base or an energy station. If you choose to retry, you pay a fee and you restart the battle from the beginning in the same exact condition in which you entered it originally. This is important to remember since you cannot simply leave a compressed dungeon map without using a special item. This means that if you are deep in a dungeon without an escape hex, heavily damaged, and try to leave, you are going to have problems returning to the entrance since most enemies respawn.Not all enemy units are equal in importance during battle. In some fights, there is also an enemy leader. If you take out this leader, you win the battle, however, some battles have no leader, necessitating an enemy-by-enemy elimination. Boss fights can also be tricky in that some are leaders with support units. These units can not only cause you harm, but automatically respawn. Hero actions are vital, you can cause an immense amount of damage in a very short time, ending the battle that much sooner. To recover hero gauge bezels expended from hero actions or a broken gauge, you can eliminate enemies or their armor. Each time you do this, a bezel is filled back in. Breaking an enemy's gauge causes their body, or their armor's, hit point gauge to fracture. To the game, a fractured gauge is treated like a full gauge. Therefore, if you fracture an enemy's gauge into four parts, you not only stun the enemy, but increase the number of bezels you can fill to four or potentially more. If your machine gunner completely loads the fractured HP gauge with scratch damage and a handgun or grenade causes the gauge to fully deplete, breaking the armor or defeating the enemy, you now have four filled bezels returned instead of just one. Hero actions can are plotted in straight lines, as you race to the end point, you are able to perform actions. You can also perform \"\"tri-attacks\"\", using resonance points obtained during hero actions. These resonance points are gathered by plotting, and completing, at least to the point of the intersection, a hero action passing between two other characters. During a hero action, a triangular pattern is displayed on the battlefield showing you the path each character will take. While performing a tri-attack, each character will perform an attack, in sequence, while running around the triangle. Like all attacks, you have to charge a tri-attack, however, the charging process for each character happens simultaneously. Most battlefields have walls and bunkers you can hide behind, along with exploding barrels and treasure containers. The leveling system in this game is also unique. You gain one point of experience for every point of damage you cause with a weapon. Each weapon class has an amount of experience it can obtain and the overall level of a character is determined by adding all three weapon class levels together. Therefore, if you have a level 30 in handguns, 30 in machine guns, and 30 in grenades, you have a level 90 character. After every four or five levels in a given weapon, you are granted a skill associated with that weapon. That skill compounds on top of any other skill you might have with that weapon and there is a chance for the skill to activate when you charge an attack during battle. Due to the leveling system, you should switch around weapons to ensure your characters have as many levels as possible. If this sounds complex, it is. This is one of the most complex battle systems I have ever encountered with an RPG. You must learn its nuances or you will become frustrated very quickly.Misc.: Having finished Final Fantasy XIII, I started looking for a new RPG to play, and found Resonance of Fate. This game may not appeal to all players or sale very well, especially since it is cursed with the worst release date in history, between Final Fantasy XIII and God of War 3, but it is certainly worth a look for gamers who love RPG's or a very complex battle mechanic. At first, I was put off by the complexity, and thus, the perceived difficulty, of the game, but as I spent more time with it, I began to appreciate the title more and more. Sure, the game is brutal, but fair, and the story is jarringly split, but the way it pulls everything together is fascinating. The graphics are very nice, though, after playing Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3 in 1080p glory (That's what it says on the back of the box) and Resonance of Fate in 720p, this game doesn't look as good, but it has an interesting and highly detailed steam punk art style. The story is a little generic and presented in a series of vignettes, but the humor and quirkiness of it make it a joy to watch. Audio is also fantastic. The voice acting, with the main characters anyway, is top-notch with Nathan Drake, Desmond Miles, err... Nolan North providing the voice of Vashyron. Musically, the game is all orchestral with the exception of some dungeons using rock. I intend to by the soundtrack as the music really is that good. There are a few stumbling points with Resonance of Fate. For one, collision detection isn't great in some battlefields. For instance, if I plot a hero action over a mechanical enemy and I jump, I may have several feet of clearance between the top of the enemy and my character, but I will still end up hitting an invisible wall, in mid air and falling, stunned, in front of the enemy. I may even plot a hero action all the way to the other side of the battlefield and hit the wall on the other side, even though the path indicated I would not be going over the wall at all. Same thing with bunkers, you need quite a bit of clearance to get over them. If you miss and fall, your hero action is terminated and you're stunned, totally vulnerable. During battles, you and the enemy have audio sprites and sayings, but there were a limited number recorded so it is commonplace to hear the same line spoken over and over again in the same battle. Some of these lines from the enemies are very irritating, like the 1920's sounding gangster saying how dangerous he is or the gang member who says a line about how strong he is but in a valley boy accent (Think valley girl but from a guy) or the overly synthesized deep bass of a mechanical enemy saying he's going to kick my a**. While doing random encounters trying to get a certain number of green colored hexes, this became maddening and I muted the television. This is a multiplatform title developed mainly for the Xbox 360, as denoted by the 720p on the box, so much of the PS3's power isn't utilized though the game runs well. In terms of trophies, this game favors completion more than repetition with the trophies being easier than Final Fantasy XIII's. The vast majority of trophies are earned through simply playing the game or exploring every nook of Basel, but there are some that are repetitive. The trophy that comes to mind is the one where you have to gain stars in all 50 arena ranks. Each rank has ten battles, so you must fight 500 battles to earn that trophy, which is very labor intensive and moderately aggravating if you wait until just before the final boss to do it. Think about it, if you play the game through twice, which is necessary to earn a trophy, and most of the enemies in the arena are much weaker than you, the process can become tedious, fast. If you are going for platinum, go up to level 25 in the arena during your first play though doing one or two ranks per chapter, then finish it off during your next playthrough. Overall, this was a great game, but it is not a Final Fantasy killer with story, nor is it a Grandia with a battle system. This game took about 60 hours to complete the first time and I project about the same for the second playthrough as the arena and the high-level map of Neverland will take a while to get through. Resonance of Fate is an excellent choice for patient gamers who thrive on stats and strategy over fast reflex action.\"", "I am a RPG fan. I read a few review articles about the game and in the end decided to purchase the game. I have played less than five hours of the game.Pro- interesting story and CG- real time game play, similar to Star OceanCon- some game play instructions are difficult to understand and executeOverall. I think it will be a great game. Once I get more game play, I will write another review.", "at first, honestly, it's VERY VERY confusing. i was so annoyed and almost threw away my controller but then i tried so hard to finish all of the training mode(super confusing training so better look it up on YouTube on how to do it) in the arena though it's *optional, i felt like it is a must to all the players of this game. after hours and hours of playing and discovering how it works, i can honestly say that i am so hooked to it. I'd be proud of myself if i finish this one cause so far this is kinda hard. i like the characters(very cute and you can even change their outfits and accessories and eye/hair color) you also have missions as a hunter and get payed by it, i love the voices and the battle system. I'm pretty sure that you will feel so annoyed about the BATTLE SYSTEM but the time you get it, you'll see, you just have to invest time and search and in the end, this is worth playing! (:", "I love the gun pack shooting system but the store-line is so bad told and it made me not want to play it for store-line no more. But still i play the game for trophy's & great battle system sense it rules with iron fist.", "The story line is typical Japanese mischief.  The combat is simple to learn, but challenging to master.  This was a good effort at trying something different on the JRPG front.", "The grids on the floor were annoying as well.  Storyline unappealing.  Graphics were not appealing either.  Would not recommend this game.", "So far this is a fun game... but is very strange. Thee combat system is overcomplicated, but not too hard to get down. What drives me insane if trying to get resonance points up by repetitively passing through the other 2 characters (You play all 3, turn based) while keeping enough space that they will have room to tri-attack. And sometimes you can just get unlucky and it not give back a hero action, which will get you killed. Also if there is a way to figure out enemy weakness other than  looking it up in town after beating them I haven't found it. And if you enter an area you aren't quite ready for (and it does not give warning) it sometimes locks you in and the only way to get out is load the last save. (Which can be hours of gameplay lost since it can only be done at certain areas.)The graphics are pretty much PS2 quality as well... really bad. And then there is stupid stuff like only being able to turn a quest in during night or during day.The combat certainly is interesting though, so far I like the characters but there isn't much story yet, and the path clearing with energy things is kind of neat as well.", "Usually with a Tri-Ace game (or Japanese RPGs for that matter) you sometimes get a quirky attack action but a great and engrossing story.  This game has a convoluted and horribly explained attack action that is wicked easy on random encounters and impossibly hard with boss fights.  If you die, guess what, it costs you money.  Want to save?  Not so fast, you can only do that at home (or with special tetris pieces).  Want to go from point A to point B?  Again, not so fast!  You have to find these silly tetris pieces to unlock paths to where you need to go.  Where do those pieces come from?  Well, they are dropped occasionally by random monsters.  Plus, you need to farm lots and lots and lots of parts.  Why?  To add 20 different gun sights to your handgun.  Seriously.  It just gets more and more silly as you progress.Plus, after 6 or 7 chapters, there is NO story.  None.  Zilch.  Who are these people?  Why are they living on a clock up in the sky?  Who cares?  I do not any more.  I hate not completing a game, but I just cannot find a reason to care about these characters or to find out why they are doing what they are.I really have a high regard for those folks that finished it.  They found something interesting that, for the life of me, cannot find.  I hope that you find this useful.", "I only recently began playing this because I am not able to on my older model PS3(MGS4 bundle). There is a known issue with older 60-80gb models where it freezes right after the initial loading menu after the intro movie. So I had to use my brothers PS3 to play this. Be forewarned, this *is* a very real bug that will never be patched by Sega because they don't listen to anyones feedback. If you own any Slim model or most of the 40/120-160gb models, I'm almost 100% positive you'll be fine.Now for the review. This game has a severe learning curve. This is one of those rare games where the battle system is nearly as complicated as a chess match and sometimes as frustrating as playing a chess match with Deep Blue. You *need* to do the tutorials provided you in the Arena when you first start out or else follow an in-depth online battle guide or you will FAIL, and you will do so hard.Why am I making it sound like it's a game not even worth playing because it's so hard? Well, I'm actually trying to provide proof for why this specific JRPG deserves to be played more than most. Resonance of Fate has a very intrigueing world, some good characters, and a mediocre story. You most likely won't be talking about it after you beat it much though. The questing, adventuring, and rebuilding a dead world is what makes you want to play. You play the game in chapters(16 to be precise) and are given a story mission to complete for each before you're allowed to proceed to the next chapter. The game is linear in that way, but you can do a number of side-quests, a 500-battle deep Arena, and many dungeons to grind your level as much as your JRPG-loving(or hating) heart desires. In fact, most of this *needs* to be done. At the very least, you need to grind some levels to make the game easier. This isn't like Dragon Quest though. You can reasonably grind 10-20 levels for each character in less than an hour if you know what you're doing.Leveling in this game is quite novel actually. You don't gain levels by just winning battles, you do so by doing damage with certain weapon types(of which there are 3: Machineguns, Hand Guns, and Granades). The more damage you do to enemies around or higher than your level, the more experience you gain for that weapon type. As each type levels, you gain max health and the ability to carry heavier weapons and eventually even dual-wield guns making for some extreme damage potential later in the game. It's actually part of how you exploit the leveling system. Each of the three characters specializes in one of the three weapon types and by using their other, weaker types to level, you actually buff up your overall level. You effectively using the stunning weapon type, which is machine-guns, to make it so that the other two characters can just cause tons of damage on high level enemies and it buffs them up quite quickly.The combat system is much too vast for me to explain here, but I will say this. I played the game for nearly 20 hours before I finally got every aspect of it down pat. I can honestly say I'm as close to an expert on it as I'll ever likely want to be and it's made my life with this game so much the better for it. There are many ways to kills enemies, some you may never use at all. The farther you get in the game, however, the more choices begin to open up. Early on you are limited by how many Hero Actions you can do, but you get more things called Bezels in the game that effectively increase how many actions you can take without putting yourself at risk. This allows you to better make use of things like Tri-attacks. Without explaining any of those terms, just know that it's important to know what situation to use what abilities. You can't just go willy-nilly with this game and run straight at a monsters face with guns-a-blazin'. That's a sure fire way to get yourself dead. D-E-D dead. So dead you'll likelly wonder how much it would cost to ship this game back to Sega via Patriot Missle.I have to point out the importance of learning the system and the enjoyment/satisfaction you will attain from doing so though. It's a rare game that makes me want to learn its deepest and darkest secrets. It is amazing to me the balance though. You can(and will) become godlike by the end of the game, but most of the game is a fight for your life. By chapter 6 or so, I was doing fine and not having too much trouble, but later zones in the game always bring higher level foes that can do massive damage if you feel as though you can go back to slacking in your playstyle.It's just too bad the script and story plotting is done at such an average level. This world that the game resides in is fascinating and the characters are interesting. Sadly, the chapter structure that works so well for the gameplay design shoots the story in the foot because it's told in short and simple cutscenes sandwiching the beginning and end of each. It's not The Last Rebellion or Enchanted Arms bad mind you, but it isn't going to win you over like FFVII either.This game grew on me a great deal over the course of a couple of weeks. As I got better I began to realize how special the battle system is in a lot of ways. Very few jrpgs give you this level of depth(Demon Souls comes to mind and as much as people seem to want to hate it, FFXIII to a certain degree). For the asking price right now, it is more than worth purchasing and giving a chance if you're looking for a great next-gen jrpg. We have to take what we can get in that department right now anyhow.", "Resonance of Fate is a decent game. It is not short, but is not too long, either. Well, unless you spend time in the Arena!Combat uses Guns and Grenades. Guns can be upgraded with cool parts. It's a blast to wrack up the hits on some of the weird opponents. They say things when you nail them, heh.The story is just interesting enough to move things along, and that's all. Graphics are pretty decent, and Sound is good. Gameplay is ok, as well, I had no hiccups when playing. Decent amount of trophies for PS3, the better ones are, as usual, harder to get.Anyway, this is a good game.", "\"***Update - I just realized I never updated after I finished.  Overall I'd say this is my fav game on PS3.  Where are the rest of the innovative games like this? It ain't easy folks, but it's awesome. Play it now and don't give up after a few hours you lazypants!***Just to give you some background, I have almost every rpg on ps2 and have played video game rpgs since their inception. In regards to taste, I really like: Shadow hearts, Persona/shin megami tensei, Disgaea, Cross edge, Suikoden, Ar Tonelico.This game has absolutly phenominal gameplay structure.  It is fun and diverse.  The many aspects of the battle system play well into deep strategy and grants the player some interesting levels of flexibility. One of the best parts is you can start developing your characters/weapons practically at the beginning of the game. You even get access to side quests right away. The types of weapons are a big part of the strategy and all characters can hold 2. There are too many facets to the battle system to get into too much detail, but one of the more unique things is how position and movement play a big role into how fast you can charge up for your next attack. One of the more fun aspects is going into over the top action sequences where you can mame your enemies by knocking them up in the air and slamming them down on the ground to earn bonus shots.  You can also attack with all 3 characters at once with the \"\"trinity\"\" mode.The game does not spoon feed you and the battles can be tough. You should do all the tutorials at least once. Battles might require some serious experimentation.The overworld map is more like a game board on which you can unlock spaces with different aquired \"\"hex\"\" items. Some spaces reveal special items, some locations, some battles.  Moving your cursor around the map could cause a random encounter, but many spaces on the board are totally safe so moving from one place to another is easy if you don't want to deal with enemies.I just finished Final Fantasy 13 and this game has everything that I felt was missing from it. In fact, this blows it out of the water in most regards. It does not have the graphics, polish and the intense narritive that FF has. I personally think both games are worth playing for different reasons. If the gameplay in FF dissapointed you, try this for sure.Gameplay A+: Fun, addictive, diverse, deep, totally unique.Style A-: Overall it's a really cool steampunk atmosphere. Some bland spots like dungeons.Sound A- : not everything is fully voiced, but it's not really a big issue. The music is great. Japanese voice track is a nice option.Graphics B: Weakest aspect of the game. The AA is not so great, so you see plenty of jagged edges. Could have had sharper textures and more polish. You will get over it after playing for an hour or two.Story: TBD. I'm still playing, but so far I am not expecting a very intense narative. The story is more subtle. I don't mean this in a bad way.Replayability B: In the NG+ you fight a different final boss. Also you unlock new difficulty settings.If I beat the game and I change my opinion I will update this review.\"", "This game is an instant classic with brilliant graphics, environments, gameplay, and story. Blends JRPG and steampunk elements into a seamless experience that comes along once every few years. Characters are interesting, tons of customization from weapons to clothing, and the world is vast and full of areas to explore. Combat is unique, and there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it you'll enjoy the depth of strategy involved. This is a rich, complex game with many layers that will suck you in and make you glad you own it. For some reason it's pretty hard to find in retail stores, but grab it if you see it. One of, if not THE, year's best.The one major flaw-- it has already been mentioned how complex the combat is. Managing so many moving parts is pretty much impossible. You've got scratch points, direct damage points, physical damage, and another half dozen different types of damage that you have to constantly be aware of. If any one character falls too low, they all go into critical mode. That means none of them can do much more than cower and take more damage, often leading to mission failure. Just to demonstrate how complicated the combat is...I've often thought the battle was going well for me until I found myself unexpectedly in critical condition--seemingly without rhyme or reason. Probably because I still don't understand everything that's factoring into my HP, and probably never will. Very punishing, very unforgiving combat.", "\"Updated Review.\"\"I'm glad i gave this game a chance because even though it is extremely hard at some parts in the game it is also very fun.\"\"Yes and no.  Yes on the hard part and the fun is based on how much you can take of the quirky story and the increasingly hard battle system.\"\"Using different types of ammo and grenades to kill enemies is just plain fun but can get frustratingly difficult if you allow the enemies to surround you.\"\"Which seems to happen all the time, there is no hiding from enemies on certain maps your only hope is to run diagonally across the map hitting w/e you can hoping to kill as many things in your first swoop that way your not battered when its the enemies turn to shoot at you.\"\"Graffics are below average even for a sega game.  It looks and feels like a PS1 game with slightly better graffics at times.  Specifically in towns and when running around the world map.\"\"Unfortunately this is true all the way through the entire game.  Only the cutscenes are smooth rest of the game feels PS1-ey.\"\"Gameplay can be very smooth but at times it is very confusing and difficult to figure out.  If you get the hang of everything namely the \"\"Tri-attacks\"\" and how to control where you run when you use a hero charge so you dont run into a wall please let me know.\"\"Thanks for telling me i can jump it helped alot knowing when your in mid-air you can spray your bullets so it hits a wider area on your enemy.  Unfortunately not even that can help you sometimes because if the enemy is bigger than you, you will end up running into him interrupting your turn making the whole point of jumping useless.  Only reason i jump in this game anymore is to find an easy way to get behind an enemy and attack the soft spot in their defense.\"\"Replay im not so sure about replay but there are a ton of things to do so far in the game and im not even halfway done yet.\"\"Fetch this, Fetch that.  Get into random battle earn hexes and use it to either open up the lego blocks on every floor or play lets make a color bridge from one terminal to the next.  I didn't get this idea and furthermore as far as i got into the game i never earned enough colored blocks to even put it to use.\"\"Overall it is a fun game.\"\"If you are a glutton for punishment.  Horrible/Non-existant story.  Uninteresting characters.  Only thing that saves this game is the guns and even that gets old after awhile.\"\"A bit of warning if your not confident you will kill every enemy and win every battle save often or burn your money before you go out because retrys cost money each time.\"\"If you can make it to chapter 7 or so there is a economic exploit you can use to gain as much money as you want to do w/e you want with.  Buy ammo, upgrades etc.  So if you get that far and you end up losing who cares you have a way to make unlimited money.Personally if you can finish this game more power to you, i just don't have the patience to put up with it past chapter 11.\"", "excellent game different from final fantasy 13.... but its different you can change any character while your playing and even more you can upgrade weapons, buy outfit and misc....", "This is just great... An awesome RPG on the PS3. You use guns to battle in a steampunk setting. Great graphics, music, controls, and everything. 80 hours in all. Add it to your collection now.", "\"The combat is difficult almost from the start so know what you are getting into. The game throws you into battle with little intro and the way you fight is unlike any other game out there.  But, if you are patient with yourself and learn the controls, and like a challenge, you'll very likely enjoy the combat. It is worth mentioning that the combat is only partly turn-based.  Once you start shooting with a character, you are fighting in real time until that character's turn has ended.  I prefer a more carefully planned turn-based combat.  The real time combat involves a certain amount of luck and perhaps a bit more luck than I would like.The framerate is solid.  There's normal mapping effects on everything to make things look shiny and shimmery. It is distracting rather than good looking.The story is darker than usual for a JRPG which is fine with me.  The world isnt very interactive though and you'll see the same characters roaming the streets of the towns over and over again.I would have liked more choices about how to build the 3 characters (since this is an RPG) but there's actually little one can choose except mods on weapons.  That sounds fun but you quickly realize there isnt that much complexity to modding a weapon.  In fact that's my only real complaint:  There's exactly 14 weapons in the game and not a lot of meaningful choices for modding them.  There's different bullet types but those are expensive and basically meant for boss fights.  None of the 3 characters have special abilities to make them different from each other short of some hit point differences.  So basically it is a great combat engine, but there's not a whole lot of \"\"rpg\"\" going on.  The fights occur in a variation of the same place every time:  there's some destructible walls and boxes but that's all you'll see in the fighting areas over and over again.There's some repetition and grinding along the way to level up -- that's pretty standard in a JRPG but here the characters dont get new abilities along the way and the comabt for all of its fun, starts to get old.Overall it is a solid JRPG, but more like a B+ than an A-\"", "\"Resonance of Fate is one of few fresh new RPG's in this age of sequels for the X-Box 360/PS3 generation of consoles. With no previous entry, it sought to find a place in gamer's hearts by uniting quick fast paced gameplay with a interestingly designed world and characters. How did it work? Well it was exceptional.The story takes a back seat in this game leaving us with essentially experiencing one year of the three main characters lives. Through their interaction through doing missions and helping to close out the story of one of the characters lives and through a non playable characters eyes of him coming to grips with the way the world is, a dazzling and interesting story is told. The highlight with the characters is their interaction. In battles they make interesting conversation with other and have excellent interactions that it becomes one of the most memorable aspects of the game. I had a few favorite lines with my favorite line of dialogue (and one will hear it quite often being).LeAnne: So do you want me on offense or defense?Vashyron: LeAnne goes both ways, thats good to know.Zephyr: Save it, will'ya!There are also many others that do bring smiles to my face (especially that involve Zephyr). The story as a whole though requires playing through twice and in quick succession (a second playthrough can take essentially eight hours or less) so it becomes a quick scene of cutscenes that weaves together into an interesting plot. I enjoyed it.Gameplay wise it is essentially a turn based action orientated RPG> Characters can wield/dual wield, machine guns (that do scratch damage), hand guns (direct damage, will convert scratch damage to direct damage), and grenades (can do both scratch and direct damage, and inflict status ailments). All can be leveled up and are directly dependent on customization options (guns can be customized, better grenades can be generated). The customization system is extensive and directly rewarding to those that engage in it (it makes a world of a difference in battle). The game could explain it better but it had a decent in game explanation. Characters level up by the number of times they use the weapons, with each one able to go to level 100, there is an arena too for training, and world map hexes (zones on the map) can be linked together for numerous benefits such as better exp gain. Essentially, with a weapon that deals tons of hits and double exp rings (give more exp to the characters) and the exp zone on the map with a double effect too, I was able to quickly raise characters levels in my first playthrough, maxing them out before the final boss.  There are other intrinsics to the battle system that are explained well in the arena's tutorial so if one explores it the game can become a highly involving and quick paced game.Ultimately, the game looks good, sounds good, and with characters jumping and running with numerous animations, it is a fresh experience. Purchasing apparel in the game can affect the characters appearance during cutscenes and looks nice in battle and out. Enemy designs never feel old or look like early game models late game with just a fresh paint job.  The game explains everything well and features addictive fast paced gameplay. I found the battle system addicting, played through the entire arena (at least 10 battles per the 50 ranks) and bonus near end game \"\"realm\"\", and finished the game in 170 hours, but a playthrough can be completed in just 30-40 hours if one rushes and doesnt level. Enjoy it if this appeals to you!\"", "I tried to get into this game, but I just didn't find it to be that fun.  There seems to be a pretty cool and unique little combat engine here, and I can see how it might be cool if you could get into it.  For me it just wasn't worth it.  Some of the reasons why I say that...Unfortunately, the learning curve is quite steep, and the game and manual teach you very little about how to play.  I felt like I had to buy the strategy guide to even figure the game out enough to determine whether or not I liked it.  There should be WAY MORE in game help or at least a detailed manual.The graphics are surprisingly poor.  This is the first game I played on my PS3, and I was really disappointed about the system in general until I tried another game and realized that the graphics in resonance of fate are particularly bad and most games look much better.  It's not just that the graphics are bad, it's also that the environments are just not that interesting, particularly the combat settings.  Maybe this improves if you play the game longer.There isn't any story to pull you in and keep you interested.  Maybe one develops as you play more, but at the start of the game there basically is no story.Overall, it just isn't a fun game."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.11951527744531631, 0.005153461825102568, 0.03747709095478058, 0.0019024318316951394, 0.11049499362707138, 0.027670612558722496, 0.04724226891994476, 0.05084237456321716, 0.057577818632125854, 0.007885770872235298, 0.02591657266020775, 0.036576177924871445, 0.04836336523294449, 0.045245423913002014, 0.03383507579565048, 0.04914025589823723, 0.08855446428060532, 0.06993011385202408, 0.02294623665511608, 0.04839249700307846, 0.06533773988485336]]}
