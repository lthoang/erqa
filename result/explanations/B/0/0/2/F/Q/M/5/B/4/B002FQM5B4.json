Yes I do feel these aspects are an important part of the buying experience, but they could change at any point and time. As of it's release, the price is a little steep, but it is a quality piece of equipment, made to last for years to come. The shipping was fast and flawless.This Logitech wireless gaming controller is awesome for those with PS2/PS3's. It works flawlessly and is said that it will reach up to 30 feet. I haven't needed to test it out that far (my living room is not that big), but I have moved it around to different locations to see if it would still work just as well, and it has. I would say the farthest I have tested it would be about 15 feet away, and it worked as well as it did 5 feet away. The wireless feature is a huge plus for us since we have several dogs in the house who love to run in front of the TV over and over and get wrapped up in any controller cords that might be hanging down. We have already lost one gaming system to dogs getting wrapped up in a controller and pulling the whole system onto the floor.One of the best features is the good adjustability of both the drums and cymbals. In our home, we have a variety of different aged video game players, ranging from 8 years old to 30 years old. This is an invaluable feature since kids aren't the same size as adults. Because this unit lets you adjust all the positions, it allows you to bring them in closer or farther away. This makes for a much more enjoyable sitting position for each person who plays. No one has to reach way out and no one feels like they are cramped into a small spot. Every drum and cymbal can be placed wherever you like, so that it is set up to just your perfect position.I would not say this unit is completely silent. You can hear someone playing it from another room. If you play the games on the expert levels, you can definitely hear the sound of the drum sticks thumping. But for us this was not an issue, as we have the volume of the TV up loud as well and the music drowns out any sounds of the controller.The stainless steel kick pedal has a very sturdy feel, which is good when you have everyone stepping on it for hours a day. It has lasted very well and worked perfectly. However, unless you have the TV volume up plenty loud as your playing the game, the pedal can be a bit noisy. It may not be something that those who are playing the game will notice or be bothered by, but if you are in the room watching, it can get a bit annoying after a while.This set uses two AA batteries and they last a good long while. We haven't ran them dead yet. I would recommend using rechargeable ones though, as it will cut down on the long term cost.Another benefit is how it folds up to be put away. A great aspect as there's not always room to have a large drum set siting out in the middle of the living room 24 hours a day. True, it's not exactly as simple as putting away a folding chair. But you have to remember, this is a sturdy, well made unit. If it folded and collapsed too easily, it would not hold up well during game play.Over all I would say this is a very high quality item that is a a must have for those Guitar Hero addicts out there!", "\"Without a doubt, the Logitech drum controller is a high quality piece of hardware. Supported by a sturdy aluminum frame, this kit is designed to stand up to drumming abuse and survive many rounds of gameplay. The poles supporting the drums and cymbals are also made of metal, and the hitting surfaces are made of a thick rubbery material. The foot pedal is sturdy, springy, and metal-plated for added durability and easier cleaning. Batteries are included, so everything you need is in the box. Unboxing and setup took about 15 minutes. The instructions are pictures with arrows and no words (for international marketing), though some text might've also been helpful.The USB dongle for connecting to the PS2/PS3 is very small (about the size of a thumb). Controls are responsive, with no lag, although you'll get best results by hitting each drum or cymbal in the middle. I tested playing a guitar withGuitar Hero World Tourat the same time and there was no issue at all with lag or interference from the dongles right next to each other.One potentially big issue is the noise from the drums. \"\"Silent\"\" and \"\"barely makes a sound\"\" are not accurate. The controller will make a lot of noise when you beat on them, making a dull thumping sound. They were easily audible from the room directly upstairs from where I was playing. You may wish to buy someDrum Silencersor avoid playing late at night to avoid disturbing family members or neighbors. Logitech claims a \"\"lively feel\"\" to the drum heads, but it does not feel springy like hitting a real drum, although the feel is better than Rock Band's drums when I played on my friend's XBOX 360.Another problem I discovered is with the twist tops of the cymbals. They are screw caps and aligning them into the groove is sometimes a challenge. I discovered that after playing a few songs, the beating caused the caps to get wedged very tightly, becoming impossible to untwist by hand. I had to use a pair of pliers to twist them loose again. To avoid this problem, I suggest twisting them only 85% of the way in.Lastly are the twist knobs that secure the cymbals and drums. They have to be loosened to pivot the drums up or down, then tightened again to lock them in place. This is a cumbersome design as each knob requires several full revolutions before being able to adjust angles. Folding and unfolding will take a minute or two from all the twisting, not seconds as Logitech claims. Then you can fold the legs in and slide the controller under your bed.All in all, a very good and solid peripheral, although the specialized nature of it (being compatible with only a few games) and the high price may scare away many gamers. If you have a lot of friends over often and will get a lot of use out of this controller, then this is a fun peripheral to add to your experience.UPDATE: 10/26/2009: After further use of this product, I am downgrading the rating. It is VERY LOUD and can be quite grating on the nerves. A friend was playing this as I tried to write another Amazon review. The thumping was quite distracting and I was worried about disturbing people in other parts of the house.\"", "This drum controller looks pretty sweet from the photos and descriptions, but it's not the end all be all.  Setting it up was a little confusing as the instructions aren't that detailed.  It's a little heavy, so it's not the easiest thing to move around.  Plus, storing the thing isn't the easiest thing either because it's a bit bigger than some of the other drum kits by Harmonics.  Also, trying to fold the thing down takes a while because you have to unscrew everything all the way to get the pads and cymbals to go all the way down.Hitting the pads and cymbals works well as it's pretty responsive.  Everything's adjustable (not easily though).  It looks nicer than some of the cheaper drum kits for Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but I don't know if I'd recommend spending the extra bucks for this.", "My father is a professional drummer. Has been since the '60's. I thought when I got this kit from Logitech that I could play it, ( I have no formal training). The first game I tried out wasPlaystation 3 The Beatles: Rock Band - Software Only. The back beats and other tracks were just too difficult to do. That being said, this product from a quality standpoint is excellent.It is very easy to set up and connect to Rock Band games. I used a piano stool to sit on. It is comfortable and feels similar to my father's electric drum set. The hits respond to the slightest tap and the frame is strong enough so that it wont move during the crazy drum solos. The foot pedal is solid feeling and responsive. I have played around a little with the drum set that comes with rock band. This one is hands down better quality and doesn't sound so plastic while playing it.If you are serious about playing drums in these games and have moved past the included drum set you cannot do better than this Logitech drum kit.Thanks for reading my review.", "I'm not a professional guitar hero player, so keep in mind my review is from a casual gamer viewpoint. My first impression of this drum controller was the quality of the product. It's pretty sturdy and seems to be well built, not just cheap plastic. For the price, I wouldn't expect anything less. The initial setup takes a few minutes and I had to readjust a few times to get everything where I wanted it. I cranked up Guitar Hero and played a few sets before making a few more adjustments. One of the biggest things I noticed was how loud the drums are. However, I my living area is small, so I'm sure that doesn't help. Just keep in mind that you may need to increase the volume of your television to block out the physical sounds you are making on the drum controller. Not a huge deal for me, and as I stated might be because of my layout. I found the drum controllers to be fun to use, though I'm not very good as of yet. I had a few friends over to check it out, and they enjoyed playing them as well. I wish I had another type of drum controller to compare it to, but I don't. Therefore, I'm not sure how much better this unit is then the cheaper units available. I do wish they would have incorporated Bluetooth into the unit, but they require you to use a USB dongle. I think for the money it should have come with Bluetooth on the unit itself so you're not using a USB port. If you are a avid gamer and play the drums in games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, I think you will find this set to be to your liking. If you are just a casual gamer, I would suggest seeing the unit in action at a friends or a store before purchasing.", "Being an avid Rock Band fan and GH fan, I have been through 2 sets of the drums (both RB1 and RB2). Each of these sets probably have seen over 2000 songs each, so of course they were beat up a bit. This logitech set puts those to shame, but at a premium price. If you want to have a set of drums that will last you the next 5 releases of these type of games, pick this set up. If you take your drums with you all over the place, pick this set up. If you like quality (very nice pads), pick this set up. Otherwise, I would just stick with your old gear or get the bundled box of RB or GH.", "The Logitech Wireless Drum Controller set is a quality arrangement of drum heads and cymbals designed to play on your Playstation 2 or 3. It is easy to assemble and only requires 2 AA batteries. Once it is assembled, you plug each drum/cymbal into the drum control center and connect the wireless receiver module into your Playstation via the USB socket and you are ready. The wireless signal is strong and the set can be used from up to 20 feet away from your console.It works with a variety of games including Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2, Rock Band Beatles & Guitar Hero 5 (these are the ones I have tested). However it does not work with the original Rock Band or Guitar Hero games earlier than World Tour.The set is easy to store, just simply fold down the drum pads and adjust the sets height and it can easily fit in a closet or other convenient space. The build quality is excellent and it would take a lot to break any of the components.I love playing on this, it is a lot of fun on your own or also great for getting friends involved so you can create a full band. Believe me you haven't had fun until you do this!Overall this is a top quality drum set and a must own for fans of the Rock Band and Guitar Hero game series!", "QUICK NOTE 09/25/09  - This drum set will not work on the original ROCK Band product.  It does support later versions such as Rock Band 2 and on.....see comments for details.-------------------------------------Logitech has another great product yet again...their quality seems to be unmeasurable and it shows with this product.  Read on for the entire review.The kit includes: Drums, Cymbals, Foot Pad, Wireless Receiver, wooden drumsticks, and PS3 Controller.  It comes double boxed and is quite large/heavy...which generally denotes that it is packaged well and is a solid product.The building of the kit is 75% completed in the box and thus your only job is to connect the cymbals, plug things in, connect the receiver, and adjust the height of the drum kit.  The PS3 controller requires 2 x AA batteries which are not included.  Simply put the unit together, plug the individual drums/cymbals/foot pad into the back of the ps3 controller using color coded plugs (both male and female are color coded), plug the receiver in to your PS3, and you are ready to rock.NOTE: This unit only works with Guitar Hero games and does not work with Rock Band.The play-ability of the drum set is perfect for any size individual since the height of the full unit and individual drumpads/cymbals can be adjusted.  That makes for easy sitting on a couch or a stool.  The quality of the pads makes for less of a plastic click sound as they are constructed of some rubber type material which keeps the noise down when you are drumming and playing the game.  Older drum sets made a lot of noise from plastic sticks hitting hard plastic pads.....thank you Logitech for fixing this.  The surface size of the pads is large enough that you wont be hitting the sides too often and thus your sticks and drums will last you for a long time to come.Pros:  Great quality, stylish look, excellent looking foot pedal, color coded wiring, and wooden drumsticks.Two Cons:One, it seems that the clips used to hold the legs/height into position are not tight enough and thus the unit tends to get lower after constant pounding while playing the game.  Its not a deal breaker as it is easily adjusted.Two, I am a bit disappointed that this drum set will not work with other games....I dont know why manufacturers/game developers have to tie hardware to their games.  If I own Rock Band and Guitar Hero I need a separate set of drums for both (that makes for a lot of extra space required).My overall rating is 4.5 on this, because it is a truly WONDERFUL piece of hardware.  My disappointment comes from the lack of being able to use it as just hardware because it is tied in with a game.  (Someone please correct me if I am wrong).", "+ Pros:+ Very quick set up+ Clear instructions+ Easy to adjust pads/cymbals+ Comfortable foot pedal - extra jack for dual foot pedal songs+ Proven compatibility with several games on both PS2 and PS3 consoles- Cons:- Does NOT work with Rock Band 1- No holder for the sticks- Price may be too steep for some- I have to stop playing long enough to write this review!WOW. This is one impressive machine!To start off, this is one of the easiest pieces of video game equipment I've even put together. The drum set comes preassembled except for the cymbals and the control box - it literally took me 15 minutes to get this up and running. The instructions for putting this together are typical Logitech - very simple to follow. I've uploaded the instructions so you can see how easy it is. Once you put in the two AA batteries, plug in the USB fob and press the PlayStation button on the unit, you're ready to rock!The cymbals and pads are made of very durable material. I spent the better part of 3 hours banging away on this set - it took the lickin' and kept on tickin'! The drum sticks themselves are made of sturdy wood (not plastic), designed to take whatever we can dish out. I really like the design of the foot pedal, because the early Rock Band pedals had the spring in the middle which led to them breaking easily. This pedal has the spring in the toe, and a strip of Velcro can be attached to the bottom to prevent it from sliding around. There's an extra jack in the back of the unit, I assume this is to plug in another bass pedal for optional songs in games like Guitar Hero Metallica.Adjusting the height and location of the drum pads/cymbals is very easy to do. With this set, I can give my arms more freedom to move around, which is a big improvement over the standard Rock Band drum controller, where the foot pedal is attached to the base and the pads can't be moved at all.Okay, so that's the unit itself. But what games does it support?Well, here's a list of the games I tried out:Guitar Hero World Tour(PlayStation 3)Playstation 3 The Beatles: Rock Band(PlayStation 3)Guitar Hero Metallica(PlayStation 3)Guitar Hero Smash Hits(PlayStation 2)I tried these on my PlayStation 3 as well as my PlayStation 2 Slim, and the games worked on each of them without any problems whatsoever.Once I finally got my hands on a copy of Rock Band 1 (Thank you Fey for lending me your copy), I tried using this drum set and it thought I was hooking up a microphone. Other reviewers have found out the same cold, hard truth...Rock Band 1 does NOT work with these drums.I was also kind of surprised to see there wasn't a holder for the drum sticks. Everything else was designed so well!The main con to this drum set is the price, pure and simple. When the PlayStation 3 came along, many consumers found themselves with PlayStation 2 peripherals that couldn't be used anymore. This unit solves that problem because it works on both platforms with several different games.There are less costly drum sets out there, but some of them are reported to be made cheaply and not built to last. If you're willing to spend the extra money for a drum set that works on 2 game systems, this set will not disappoint - I'm very happy with Logitech products because they're made with gamers in mind. Even with the lack of support for Rock Band 1, I still love this drum set.Now that this review is done, I can go back and get the Beatles through Shea Stadium. Rock on!", "This drum set is so awesome.  It's very well made & the adjustability of pretty much everything is really great.  The packaging was excellent & the set up was very fast & easy.  It's also nice how easy it is to fold up & set back up.  As others have mentioned my only complaint would be that there's not a place to store the drumsticks.  Aside from that I can't find anything wrong with this set.So far I've only had the chance to play this with Guitar Hero & it's been a blast.  Can't wait to pick up a Rock Band & give it a try as well.  I have heard though that it doesn't work with the original Rock Band but should be fine with the rest.  I would recommend this wireless drum controller to anybody who loves these types of games.", "My review and comparison is based primarily on how this drum set compares to the original drum that came with our Rock Band system for the xbox 360.  And in that comparision there is a lot to love about this drum set.  Here are some of the top items:1. It was easy to set up.2. It works with both PS2 and PS3 (a nice feature because we have both systems).3. It folds so it will take up a lot less space that our other drum set!4. The foot pedal can be positioned anywhere, and it is much more comfortable to use than the Rock Band foot pedal.5. The pads have a nice thick rubber-like surface.6. The rims on the drum heads are lower than the drum surface and this makes it much easier to hit the drum's surface.  The rims on our Rock Band drums are higher and often the sticks hit the rims and do not make a strong enough contact with the drum surface.7.  Almost everything is adjustable so you can custom fit it to your size or style.8. I love having cymbals!What could be better?1.  Holders for the drum sticks would be nice as indicated by an earlier reviewer.2.  Greater compatiblity with other games and systems (I can wish can't I?).Bottom line: I really like these drums!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.20248518884181976, 0.03124258667230606, 0.17005325853824615, 0.16481105983257294, 0.06078006327152252, 0.09739707410335541, 0.03378371521830559, 0.004724790342152119, 0.04699701443314552, 0.13988417387008667, 0.047841086983680725]]}
