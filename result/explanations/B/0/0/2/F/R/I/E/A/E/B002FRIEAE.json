No need to worry about any thing being broken while in transit. The guitar itself is very well made and feels almost like the real thing. It works very well with all Guitar Hero games and is also compatible with the Rock Band ones as well.Here are the cons though. My 13 year old loves the GH and Rock Band series but finds this very heavy, so it's not that perfect for the younger ones who love to play. The fret buttons are the same size as the GH buttons but are spaced more apart so it's more difficult for those with smaller fingers to play. The placement of the star power button is not where you'd expect it to be but if you usually tilt your guitar for star power then that shouldn't be a problem.Besides the cons above, I'd say this is a great guitar for adults. For the kids I'd stick with the plastic models that come with the game series.", "\"For Guitar Hero/Rock Band fans looking for an even more authentic experience, there's no better guitar peripheral than the Logitech Wireless Controller.  However, that authenticity comes with a steep price tag, so the decision lies not in whether or not this product is high quality, but whether or not you're comfortable parting with so much cash.First off, from a distance a casual observer will mistake this device for a real guitar.  It is nearly as large as a real electric guitar and is constructed from the same materials, which eliminates the \"\"toyish\"\" feeling of the plastic pack-in and other after market options.The buttons, strum bar, and whammy bar all operate with a quiet precision you just won't find in any other competing product.  The build is also sturdy enough to withstand endless hours of play.  Even the occasional drop during a fumbled pass from one friend to another likely won't harm this axe.The only gripe I have is over the colour selection.  You can choose any colour you like, so long as it's fluorescent orange.  I assume this choice was made so the gadget would stand out on store shelves, but if a gaudy hue was required, why not go with neon green to match the Xbox 360, for which this device is designed?  That said, the merits of this peripheral far outweigh any objections to the style.All in all, this is THE luxury guitar peripheral, on par with theIon IED07 Premium Rock Band Drum Kit for Xbox 360.  If you're serious about your music games and are willing to drop some accordingly serious dough, you won't go wrong here.\"", "\"If you have played Guitar Hero, or even Rock Band for any amount of time or played these games on display retail stores, chances are you have experienced guitar malfunctions like double-strumming or simply the button presses not registering at all.  This is VERY frustrating especially when you are trying to concentrate on the button patterns on the screen as well as having to compensate for the lack of quality in the controllers themselves.  I have gone through 3 Guitar Hero 3 controllers just from normal use and the pogo pins that were used in designing that become very unreliable after some time.  The Rock Band controller which is built much better than the Guitar Hero controller also may eventually suffer from episodes of double strumming and the strum bar itself seems a little too flimsy.  I am on my third Rock Band controller as a result and even this one seems to be messing up again.  My 4th Guitar Hero controller is also messing up again, with buttons not registering or just cutting off for no reason during a sustained note.  It had gotten so bad with Guitar Hero, I haven't even played the game in over a month and I contemplated being done with the series for good since I had a hard time finding a good reason to spend more money on another controller that would also break down the line (after the warranty period of course).Well if you have the money and are sick of dealing with this plastic mess that comes with these games then I encourage you to take a look at this premium guitar controller made by Logitech.  Like me, the first thing you will notice is the sheer weight of it.  While its only slightly bigger than the Rock Band controller, its twice the thickness and it tips the scales at nearly 8 pounds.  The guitar is made from the same materials as a real guitar so you a neck that is real wood neck, metal tuning pegs that actually turn and a rosewood finger board.  Knock on it with you fist you won't hear the cheap hollow plastic sound you would hear with the standard controllers. I haven't held a real electric guitar so I don't know how the weight compares to the real thing but I imagine if it uses real material, then its close to the real weight.  For comparison purposes, it seems to be about the same weight as my cello was.What is even better is that it is very responsive.  There are no issues with double strumming or unregistered button presses and once you get over the weight of it you should become very comfortable with using it.  In fact I was able to get even higher scores on songs that I thought I had already maxed out.  I tried this controller on my two Guitar Hero tiles, that I currently own. Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero 3.  Of course this will work with the newer Guitar Hero games as well.  For those that are wondering, it also works great for Rock Band, but for some reason, Activision (the parent company of the the maker's of Guitar Hero) \"\"Expressly prohibits\"\" you from using this controller with Non-Guitar hero games.  I have no idea what that is all about, but anyway.The strum bar seems to be built to last and in addition to be quiet like the the Rock Band controller's there is also a slight click feel whenever you move it up and down giving you the feedback you need during intense strumming sections.  The Rock Band controller's strum bar was virtually silent, but lacked the click feedback.  On the other hand, the Guitar Hero 3 controller had the click feedback, but was very loud.  This guitar combines the best of the two into one.  Because this controller is made for Guitar Hero and not Rock Band, it lacks the solo buttons that are on Rock band controllers and IF you were to use this controller for Rock Band, you do not have the ability to tap the solo sections as you can do on the standard controller.  Its really my only complaint and though it would have been a nice addition to have both the slider AND solo buttons, I realize this controller was made for Guitar Hero's games so there was no need for them to add the \"\"solo buttons\"\" and I am sure Activision saw to it that Solo buttons were NOT added since using this controller with Rock Band is \"\"EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED\"\".I remember playing Guitar Hero in the arcade for the first time and I really liked the durability and feel of the controller and mentioned to my wife how they should make the same type of durable controller available for home use.  Well Logitech did just that but it will cost you...I love the guitar.  However, even though the money I spent replacing my controllers would have been able to get this one instead, I don't think I could part with so much money to get this unless I just had a couple of hundred bucks laying around.  However if you are VERY serious about your Guitar Hero games and sick of having the plastic controllers break constantly and feeling cheap and can part with a good chunk of change, then I recommend this controller.  I will update my review accordingly if it starts giving me problems down the road, but from what it seems like now, this controller seems to be VERY durable and if you were to purchase it, it should be the last Guitar Hero controller you'll ever need to buy and let's hope so considering the steep price.\"", "\"I'll start by assuming that you've already decided that you want the most realistic controller possible when playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band.  So taking price out of the equation, how does the Logitech Wireless Guitar Controller perform?  Very well, although not quite perfectly.CONSTRUCTION & APPEARANCEFrom the moment you unbox it, you feel that this is no plastic toy.  It is larger than any standard-issue GH controller by the length of the headstock (the far end where the tuning keys are).  Note that this means that it will not fit in the GH gig bag, so storage may be a concern for some.  Made of solid wood, it is also quite heavy - you'd better keep a hand on this beast when turning around or else bye-bye lamp.  While the quality materials and solid construction are the foundation of the controller's authenticity, note that they also potentially make it a poor fit for younger kids.In terms of appearance, the pictures don't do its color justice - its body is painted with an aggressively day-glo orange gloss paint.  Everyone's tastes will differ, but this struck me as something that only a die-hard Cleveland Browns fan could love.  For the price, I would have rather seen a more traditional black or else even a multi-tone sunburst that further ups the look and feel of an actual guitar.PERFORMANCEThe performance of any GH controller begins and ends with the strum bar, in my opinion.  The Logitech's strum bar is top-notch, allowing for precise control during up- and downstrumming at any speed.  On the other hand, the buttons are not quite as responsive as I would have liked them to be - very good, but players looking to gold-star song after song may be frustrated.  This may be partially due to the size and length of the neck as well - I found that I had to swing the neck upward to properly position my wrist to reach all of the buttons (again, another issue for kids and other players with small hands).  I also have to take issue with Logitech's claim that the fret buttons \"\"don't 'clickety-clack'\"\".  On the contrary, they're among the loudest ones that I've ever encountered, but this shouldn't be very important to most players.Logitech continued to improve on secondary button placement with this controller.  For example, the start button is concealed as the bridge.  More importantly, the Star Power button is concealed as the pickup next to the strum bar.  More convenient than prior controllers, but still not perfect (attention guitar controller designers:  the obvious placement is on the back of the headstock so that you can use the thumb of your button hand).  Luckily, the sensor that feels when you tilt the guitar is the most responsive and accurate one I've ever used - finally, you can reliably trigger it when you want it but also won't have so many accidental instances, either.Left-handers are already used to the tremolo (whammy bar) being in the way, so that's nothing new to deal with here.  However, Logitech placed the XBox dashboard button so that it rests under your forearm when you're playing left-handed.  On more than one occasion, I've accidentally paused the game by pushing down a little bit too much.  Again, not a deal-breaker, but something to consider when making an investment like this one.I used the Logitech with Rock Band 2, The Beatles: Rock Band, and Guitar Hero 5 and found the performance to be consistently very good with each game.  RB fans should note that the hammer-on bar is not usable with that game (as has always been the case with all GH-branded controllers).CONCLUSION/PROS & CONSLogitech has a great track record creating PC peripherals and all sorts of gaming controllers.  This wireless Guitar Hero controller is no exception.  A few minor design issues notwithstanding, it's a fantastic controller, marrying an authentic feel with very solid performance.  Assuming you can handle the price tag, this is the one to go get.Pros:* Solid, quality construction* Great performance thanks to a top-notch strum bar and Star Power sensorCons:* Large and heavy for kids and players with small hands* Fret buttons aren't best-in-class reliable (i.e. the GH III Les Paul)\"", "\"If you play Guitar Hero and are tired of having issues with the original guitar controllers, this Logitech Guitar Controller will solve your problems.Although this controller is expensive compared to the original equipment, it is built to last. The guitar really does feel like a real guitar should.This is the most realistic guitar controller available in my opinion for the Xbox 360.Most casual gamers may not be interested in spending the money for a quality guitar controller, but if you are a hard core gamer, or a musician who just prefers somethings more authentic, than you will be happy with your purchase.Positives:+ Made From Quality Materials+ Feels Real As Opposed To A \"\"Toy\"\"+ Play Well - I Had No Issues+ Easy To Setup & Use+ Enjoyable To Play+ It Looks GreatNegatives- Price- Heaviness (Some may find it too heavy after a while)Bottom Line: Although price will keep many people from enjoying this quality controller, if you can spring for the cash, you won't be disappointed.The guitar is built of quality materials, and the price reflects this.\"", "It seems incomprehensible that Logitech would take the time to build such a heavy and well put-together piece of equipment, ensure sound body construction, turnable guitar pegs and even a false bridge, and fail in the ways that are actually important.#1 - Fret ThisThe biggest and most glaring problem with this guitar is the fret design, feel, and functionality. This and the strum bar are like the most obvious parts of what I think should be considered when taking the time to build a guitar controller, but I guess I have to explain it when talking about this one.I understand that when building guitar controllers, it is all about trade off. Do you make the frets raised or flush, loose or sticky, how far apart do you space them? The first thing I noticed when I took the guitar out of the box was how far apart the fret buttons are spaced. However, I then realized that thinking they were spaced further apart than the normal Guitar Hero guitar controllers is just an illusion created by the extra width and length of the neck of the guitar. The problem is that even though the guitar is the largest controller I have ever used, the buttons are the same size as every other guitar controller from the Guitar Hero people. If you're going to make a larger guitar, make the buttons larger too. They don't have to be abnormally large, but it makes it very difficult to do hammer-ons and pull-offs when the frets are spaced as they are.The second problem with the frets is their shape. They are almost rectangular, which isn't a problem, but the fact that they have sharp sides is. What this means for someone like me, who plays on Expert, is that when I have fast hammer-ons of pull-offs, it's hard to slide my fingers down or up the neck of the guitar. I'm sure in time it is something I could learn to adapt to, but it seems like something that wasn't even considered. A smart guitar controller would be easy to use for people playing on beginner, but be advanced enough to meet the needs of someone playing on expert. The frets should have been more tapered at the edges, and either closer together, of just generally bigger to accommodate faster finger movement.Lastly, as far as the frets go, I have also already experienced problem with the blue button not registering when playing a chord. This is something that takes time with the guitar hero controllers to break in, but honestly, we're about four years past the release of Guitar Hero 2, it's time these people designing the controllers get with the program. From the get, Rock Band guitar controllers have never had problems with the fret buttons. They are plagued by their own set of problems, but the frets are something they do absolutely right.#2 - Strummer? -- I don't even know'er!There isn't a whole lot to complain about as far as the strum bar goes. It is stiff like I like it (that's what she said?), and there is a satisfying click when you strum (I know a lot of people prefer the silent strum bars, and I understand that, I'm not knocking this guitar for trying to please people on both sides of the aisle). This next part is going to be difficult to explain. I, and I don't know how many others do it like this, strum THROUGH the strum bar when I play. I guess picture someone playing the string of a real guitar, brushing their thumb against the string to play the note. That is how I play these guitar controllers. And while I have not yet had any trouble with over-sensitivity (strumming once and having the game read it as a double-strum when the strum bar springs back into place), when I strum through the notes, the controller makes a weird FLOINKing noise that is even more grating than the loud clicking that accompanies most of the first and second gen. Guitar Hero controllers.#3 - A Little Rough Around the EdgesI understand that this controller was designed to mimic a realistic (albeit still scale) guitar. But when you're going to sacrifice comfort for realism, my question is why? I play for maybe an hour or so a day, using this controller has hurt my right wrist, left forearm, and the bottom joints in my fingers. The neck of the guitar has pretty hard and sharp edges, and when you are moving your hand up and down the neck a lot, it is going to hurt your fingers. I ended up taking sandpaper to the edges to round them out and make it easier and more comfortable to play. This was not difficult to do, but the fact remains that it is something that should have been taken into consideration when designing it.Second, the butt of the guitar is the same way. While more rounded, there is no comfortable position to rest your strumming arm on the guitar without rubbing your forearm raw. Again I ended up putting a piece of foam held in place with double sided tape, to stop my arm from getting hurt. If you don't play on expert, you should really be fine with this guitar, and shouldn't experience very many problems, but this thing really wasn't built for the serious guitar gamer. That sounds dumb to say, but it's the truth.The spacing of the frets, and how loose they are, makes it so that you want to press down hard on them to ensure that you don't miss chords because the guitar isn't reading you as pressing the button down enough, really has hurt my wrist as well. The longer neck and the spaced frets places your wrist at an awkward angle. This is the first guitar controller that really has hurt my wrist, and that is a problem. When there are so many stupid problems plaguing something you're going to be using a lot, you eventually start to see that it just isn't worth it to keep using.In conclusion, if you don't play on expert, you will probably love this guitar. It's heavy, solid, and really cool. I mean it really is, I'm not denying it. But it really wasn't built with function at it's core. It's more showy than actually practical.", "Once you pick up this guitar controller, you'll know its more than some cheap toy (which is good, as you'll have that feeling when you pay for it too).  This feels more like a well made tool (its made of real wood), but just don't try to plug it in an amp or anything for that matter, as it's wireless.  The wireless works very well, as its an officially licensed accessory that doesn't require some odd dongle.  Just plug the batteries (included) in and fire up your favorite guitar game.  At first its a little tight, but it quickly establishes itself as a smooth and precise controller.  Before long the weighty axe starts to be a bit of a pain on the ole back, but  since its wireless you can grab a chair even if its across the room.Style wise it's more of a modern Guitar Hero controller than Rock Band, but it works great in both.  It also works great in DJ Hero.  The frets and all of the other controls are positioned in the same locations and with similar spacing, but the larger guitar makes it feel more natural and is easier to play for extended periods (as long as the weight isn't an issue).  It looks awesome (bonus points if you love orange), and it doesn't look so bad in your living room, which is more than I can say for other controllers.  Plus it makes a great home defense tool, as it'll likely create a far bigger knot in the head than any baseball bat.", "The first thing I noticed when holding this controller -- it does not feel like a controller.No it feels like you're holding a real guitar. This is probably helped by the fact that it's made of wood and generally is a well built product.I tried it with Guitar Hero and found that it responded well to the game and had no issues with playing. The little buttons midway through that are kind of pressed in I found no use for but I guess other people may find them to be useful.It's a shame they didn't make real buttons at the bottom for base use in Rockband but I guess this really was built with Guitar Hero in mind so it's not a huge deal.It's a quality guitar and works fairly well.", "\"The title says it all... we received this Logitech wireless guitar through Amazon's Vine program and we have officially become Guitar Hero junkies.  Never have we felt the need to jump on the Guitar Hero/Rock Band wagon until this beauty entered our homes.My husband nor I are guitar or instrument-fluent players.  We are your average XBOX 360, Nintendo DS & Wii players that enjoy games that keep us entertained and keeps our competitive streaks satisfied.  Once out of the box, the orange color stands out and it does suit the guitar.  If the stand is purchased, one may just walk by this \"\"toy\"\" and believe that it is real.  I am not sure how it compares to a traditional guitar in weight/size, but to my untrained eye/hand it looks and feels real.  It has a wonderful weight and the strum bar is SILENT.  That seems to have been an issue with the buttons clickety/clacking on the plastic guitars.  The tune pegs on the top actually rotate 360 degrees making the guitar even more realistic.  It was a pleasant surprise to actually see that the head stock (top of guitar) and fingerboard (where the buttons are)backing is made of wood.  This makes the hefty price tag just a bit more bearable... only a bit though!One issue that I personally have is that the whammy bar is right near the strum bar.  I have heard endlessly that the proper way to \"\"rock out\"\" is while standing... but I love to \"\"rock out\"\" from the comfort of my couch with the guitar laying on my thighs.  This position causes me to constantly hit the whammy bar while strumming.  The other only issue that I feel is the fact that the price tag is very hefty and just too high for an add-on to a game.  I can understand how the companies feel that it is necessary because of the quality construction but at the end of the day this is a toy for a video game.  Compatibility is not an issue and even though the guitar is advertised for Guitar Hero it works just fine with the Rock Band series.Highly recommend for true fans of the Guitar Hero & Rock Band series respectively and for the niche market that wants to really feel like they are playing a true guitar; for those individuals this is the perfect high-end toy with countless & endless hours of fun.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1164359524846077, 0.12190907448530197, 0.04047290235757828, 0.03770812600851059, 0.14736682176589966, 0.11559932678937912, 0.11284789443016052, 0.15058210492134094, 0.15707777440547943]]}
