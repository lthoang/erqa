It was not that long ago when you had to run wires and cabling through your house in order to achieve the kind of functionality that this little relatively inexpensive camera provides.  I initially bought two of these BL-C230A units early in 2010, and like them so much that I bought two more last year.  I also have Panasonic's previous modelPanasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11security camera.  Although I can think of a myriad of uses for these kinds of cameras, including nanny-cam, pet-cam, security monitoring, and, yes, even voyeuristic/exhibitionist purposes, I mainly use my cameras for pet-cam and house-sitter cam duties whenever I am away from home.I have used many of this camera's different configuration options, and its large set of features are truly very useful.  The camera's control/administration panel, accessed through a Web browser, can be displayed in the languages of English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese.  You can interactively pan/tilt the camera lens and save 8 preset locations for the camera turret to aim at, assigning each preset a descriptive name of your choice.  In addition to the 8 camera tilt/angle presets that you assign descriptive names to, you can also save 4 other presets that are labeled as \"\"Home Position\"\", \"\"Alarm1\"\", \"\"Alarm2\"\", and \"\"Sensor\"\".  Brightness, white balance, and three different image resolutions (640x480, 320x240, 192x144) are configurable, as well as being able define the captured image quality for 'Favor Clarity', 'Favor Motion', or 'Standard' ('Standard' is midway between the Clarity and Motion settings) for the images received by the camera lens.The image 'Resolution' and 'Image Quality' settings affect the size of the images that are captured, and you can then either store these captured images locally in the camera's memory, or use a transfer method to send the images to another device.  For example, if I set my BL-C230A camera's 'Image Resolution' to the maximum of \"\"640x480\"\" with an 'Image Quality' of \"\"Favor Clarity\"\" (which increases the image size more than \"\"Favor Motion\"\"), the camera can store the most recent 346 images in its memory.  And if I set my 'Image Resolution' to the maximum of \"\"640x480\"\" with an 'Image Quality' of \"\"Favor Motion\"\" (which decreases the image size more than \"\"Favor Clarity\"\"), my camera can store the most recent 692 images in its memory.  If I really want to maximize the number of images that are stored on the camera for time-lapse photography purposes without resorting to transferring the images via email, FTP, or HTTP, I can set 'Image Resolution' to the smallest \"\"192x144\"\" size (suitable for nanny-cam/pet-cam purposes, but too small if you need facial detail of strangers) and 'Image Quality' to \"\"Favor Motion\"\", and the camera's memory will store 3861 images.  Set up this way using the camera's timer trigger function, I can take a snapshot every 20 seconds to cover the latest 22 hours of monitoring within my defined days of the week and hours of the day.The camera may be set to trigger based on heat sensor detection, motion detection, sound detection, or timers.  You can trigger the camera to issue a JPEG image capture, send an email, issue an alarm sound from its built-in speaker, or some action based on whether the heat/motion/sound detection is set off, and the camera maintains a log of these alarm events.  You can likewise adjust the sensitivity of these detection mechanisms.  I have not used the heat sensor option much, but both the motion detection and timers work very well.  For times when you are not viewing the camera in real-time streaming video, you can define various timers, for instance, to take a snapshot every 15 seconds during weekdays and every 5 minutes during weekends between specific hour ranges, and you can have the image snapshots transferred via email (e.g. you can also email images to your phone), FTP, or HTTP protocols for storing the images and viewing later on.  The camera also has built-in memory that can store many hundreds of images if you do not want to transfer the images anywhere.  In that case, using your Web browser to login to your camera's Web interface, you can view either the real-time streaming images or the images that are directly stored on the camera.  With this \"\"No Transfer\"\" approach, you can configure the camera to either not overwrite existing images, or overwrite/replace the older images with new images as the memory gets filled up.The camera has four different kinds of alarm sounds that it can give off.  One alarm sound is a bit like a telephone ring jingle.  Another alarm sounds like a police siren.  And the other two alarms sound to me like odd electronic dog barks.  You can cause the alarm sound to automatically trigger whenever the heat detection or motion detection sensor activates.  This could be used as either an alarm for an intruder alert, for example, or I can also imagine a scenario of placing this camera in a room or area (e.g. rug or sofa) where you do not want a family pet to enter (of course, this assumes that the dog/cat would be scared off by the alarm sound which, although not a blaring 120-decibel burglar siren, is still a bit louder than many typical doorbell or telephone ring volumes).  You can also operate the alarm using the camera's control/administration panel by clicking a button while watching the camera's streaming video in real-time.  I find no purpose for using the two alarm sounds that sound like odd dog barks, and it would have been really cool if you could load your own MP3 sound files into this camera and use them as your own custom alarm sounds (e.g. to preload some spoken instructions for a babysitter/housekeeper or set up an alarm sound where you issue a stern \"\"No!\"\" command to your dog/cat).  You can automatically activate these alarm sounds if a heat sensor or motion detector trigger gets set off, but, again, realize that they are not 120-decibel burglar alarms (i.e. no one outside of the building will hear it).  But the camera's alarm sound may be just enough of a surprise to spook an intruder, causing the person to leave the area.The best images are captured during the daytime.  This camera does not have infrared night vision capability, if that is one of your must-have requirements.  Also, this camera is not weatherproofed for outdoor use.  You can configure the camera's 'Shutter Speed' for either \"\"1/30 second\"\", \"\"1/60 second\"\", or \"\"1/120 second\"\".  Instead of defining a fixed 'Shutter Speed', there is also a very useful \"\"Color Night View\"\".  I always set my cameras to use the \"\"Color Night View\"\" mode.  When the camera is pointed into a darkened room or outside on a dark street at night, the images are definitely more grainy in appearance compared to daytime/well-lit images.  This camera is not optimized for night vision.  But at least with the \"\"Color Night View\"\" mode, this mode activates automatically when the camera image is dark, causing the image to become brighter.  When \"\"Color Night View\"\" is selected, the shutter speed becomes \"\"1/30 second\"\" when 'Color Night View' is not activated (i.e. when there is sufficient light in the image area).  When the 'Color Night View' mode activates (e.g. after the sun sets), shutter speed decreases in order to brighten the image.  The decreased shutter speed does also result in motion blur on the images though.  As with most webcam lenses out there, there are inherent constraints with how effective this kind of lens can be at producing clear non-grainy images in dimly lit areas (for true night vision, you really need an infrared security camera).  As with a photography camera, there is the delicate balance between shutter speed for capturing moving objects/people/pets without blur, and keeping the shutter open long enough to gather enough light from the scene (this Panasonic camera does not offer the \"\"ISO\"\" settings of a digital photography camera though).  And one of the main factors for why point-and-shoot cameras usually produce grainier night photography compared with dSLRs is the combination of the larger, more-sensitive sensor combined with the bigger better lens for gathering light that a dSLR uses.  The BL-C230A has a larger, upgraded CMOS sensor compared with its BL-C131A predecessor, but the clarity of its low-light/night images is really no better than the previous BL-C131A model.  There are security cameras that use CCD sensors with better low-light capability than the BL-C230A, but these cameras are also more expensive.If you want better low-light resolution, along with the capability of not only listening into the room using the camera but also being able to interactively speak into your computer to broadcast your voice back out through the camera, consider the better (and more expensive)Panasonic BB-HCM511A Network Camera with Two-Way Audio.  The BB-HCM511A has a CCD sensor that offers better low-light image clarity than the BL-C230A's CMOS sensor.  And the BB-HCM511A's two-way audio that lets you speak back into the monitored area using your computer lets you do things like interactively talk with a babysitter/housesitter, or if you see your dog, Fido, standing on the sofa, you can tell your dog to get off of the sofa (assuming that it will listen to you, of course).  Unfortunately, the BB-HCM511A is not wireless like the BL-C230A; it needs a Cat-5 network cable attached to it!  And it does not appear that Panasonic makes a wireless equivalent of its BB-HCM511A.The camera's microphone, while not of extremely high quality, is actually quite sensitive and when the unit is placed inside up against the window of a house, the camera's microphone can pick up the conversation of people standing outside on the front sidewalk with a decent amount of clarity (if your goal is security monitoring of people outside the house).  When the camera is used for the purposes of monitoring and interacting with a nanny, babysitter, pet-sitter, or house-sitter, you can sort of use this like a \"\"videophone\"\" by viewing the camera's streaming video while you are talking to the other person who is within the camera's view on your cell phone.The control/administration panel Web page can display all of the various Panasonic cameras that you have set up, and you can monitor up to 16 Panasonic cameras (not just BL-C230A models) in real-time from one page, just like how the security guards at department stores and casinos monitor various security cameras.You can allow other users to also access the administration panel, or you can define up to 50 user IDs for general users who can login and access the camera viewing, but cannot alter the setup and configuration administration functions.  For your guest user logins, you can define very specific combinations of access levels for what each of those users can control on the camera.  For instance, you can prevent some of your users from panning, tilting, or zooming the camera lens, other users can be restricted from listening in via the camera, etc.  You can configure the camera lens' angle/tilt positioning to return to one of the 12 saved presets after a certain amount of time has passed without any operation of the camera.  The time duration for returning the camera lens back to its \"\"home base\"\" position may be configured for either 10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, or 1 hour.  This is a very handy feature in situations where you may have guest users rotating the camera lens around, and you want your camera to return to a \"\"home base\"\" position after you or other guest users have moved the lens turret around using the Web-based control panel's arrow buttons.The top of the camera has a [Privacy] button that, when pressed, hides the lens so that no one can snoop when you do not want them to.  As the administrator, using the administration panel, you can control whether this [Privacy] button even works; this will prevent, for example, a babysitter from purposely trying to cover up the camera by pressing the [Privacy] button.  (Yes, the babysitter could still cover the camera lens with a towel, but...) You can also enable or disable the camera's 'Privacy' mode using the Web-based administration panel.The camera can be configured for access either via HTTP or HTTPS.  Using the HTTPS option will encrypt the data transmissions if you are worried about someone using wireless sniffing techniques on your camera data.I think that Panasonic totally *ROCKS* for hosting a Dynamic DNS service for **FREE**, so that you, along with your other guest users, can access your camera using their Web hosting service.  Hopefully, Panasonic never decides to charge any monthly subscription fee for this service!!!  Some other manufacturers of security cameras require a monthly subscription fee to access their cameras from the Internet.  I have been using their security cameras with their free viewnetcam Web domain for almost four years now (you get your own personal viewnetcam Web domain URL when you set up your camera and that is how you access your camera using a Web browser), and Panasonic's servers have always been available online and glitch-free whenever I have accessed my cameras using a Web browser from various distant regions around the world.I do have one complaint about the BL-C230A though. The provided installation and setup information is very sparse, and may confuse some users who are not computer-savvy in the areas of networking, routers, etc.  Panasonic really should get a professional technical writer to write an installation/setup **booklet**, instead of just the 4-page 'Installation Guide' and 2-page 'Setup Guide' foldout sheet.  The 'Installation Guide' covers mounting and positioning of the camera, and the 'Setup Guide' (which is smaller than the 'Installation Guide') covers the highly technical details of configuring the camera for wireless use, port forwarding, and accessing your camera over the Internet.  On top of that, the vagaries of different computer and network configurations makes it likely that there will be no \"\"one size fits all\"\" approach to setting up the network camera. But the good news is that Panasonic's tech support is excellent if you call them.  I phoned Panasonic's tech support once three years ago when configuring a BL-C131A, and once more last year when I had questions about my BL-C230A.  During both phone calls, their tech support person was patient and very knowledgeable; I could tell that both persons who I talked to understood my configuration issues, instead of being support robots offering canned responses.  When you go through the 'Setup Guide' instructions, you are guided step by step, and the instructions that are provided should work for *most* people.  My environment consists of Windows with a Linksys router, and by just following the steps, I had my camera working in wireless mode fairly quickly.  However, some knowledge of routers, IP addresses, and \"\"what is a port number\"\" would also immensely help if you want to customize your setup even more (which I manually customized with my setup that now uses four BL-C230A cameras).  That kind of information is not covered in the provided installation and setup manuals for this camera, but you can read about that just by doing some Internet searches.&#3051; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Overall, this is an excellent wireless network camera for the price.  It comes with a 1-year parts/labor warranty.  A longer 2-year or 3-year warranty would have been more reassuring.  But I have an older-model BL-C131A security camera facing out through a west-facing window, and for more than 3 years now, that camera has worked flawlessly while being plugged in constantly and it gets the brunt of the full afternoon sun and heat during the summers being sandwiched between the window glass and fully closed shutters. The camera's installation instructions tell you not to position the camera in direct sunlight, but my old BL-C131A has been baking in Denver's strong mile-high sunlight for 3+ years now, and it still works every day, either pressed up against cold wintertime glass or hot summer heat. Panasonic also makes a variety of other wired and wireless cameras, including weatherproofed outdoor cameras, ceiling-mounted dome cameras, and vandal-proof security cameras.  Some of their network cameras cost less, and some cost many hundreds of dollars more.  This unit suits my needs perfectly.\"", "Cam has nice features pan, tilt, zoom, remote access but...The software is lacking. This cam is advertized as being able to be accessed from anywhere via the internet, including by smart phone. Well what is not mentioned is that you have to use a website not an app for the phone. So when you log in the picture size is so small you have a hard time making out any detail. Then by the time you increase the screen size in order to access the controls the picture can not bee seen on the screen. VERY poor design for remote acess in this smart phone world. Picture quality is good but not any better than a $50+ web cam then can do most of the same things.Also as usual some features are not availble remotely with out a paid subscription service.Returned. Way overpriced for what it is.", "\"I've owned various network cameras over the years, from Axis, D-Link, and Linksys.  This Panasonic camera is by far the best one I've used to date because of its excellent image quality and good pan tilt feature, all at a pretty reasonable price for what you are getting.  The camera itself is very compact, it's about 3x3x3, and the white cube design makes it reasonably attractive (in other words, it won't stick out like a sore thumb).  Images and video are all very good in daylight conditions.  Compared to the cameras I've had in the past, the Panasonic images are incredibly sharp and clear (with no manual lens focusing required).  The video streams smoothly across my 802.11g network.  Low light video, on the other hand, is not that great.  This is a great daytime camera, it's not for you if you want to do nighttime monitoring, such as in a nursery with a night light (which I am not).  The camera also streams audio, and this feature works very well.  Audio comes across smoothly and clearly.  The audio feature is one-way (listen only), however you can trigger the camera to sound an alarm if you want to get someone's attention on the other end.  Pan-tilt feature tops off this camera's feature set.  It's not 360 degree pan/tilt, but this camera also doesn't cost $1000+.  You can get about 90 degrees panning left to rigiht, and about 40 degrees vertical tilt.  The 90 degree pan is sufficient to cover a normal room, just place the camera in a corner and you'll be able to see most everything in the room.  The movements are pretty responsive, there's maybe a 1 second lag between issuing the command and seeing movement.  The pan/tilt camera movement is pretty quiet, but not 100% silent; you can hear the lens moving when it is dead silent, but otherwise it's not that noticeable.  The zoom feature on this camera is digital and not optical, so basically there is no zoom (which is pretty standard for this price range).  Setup was very easy and straight forward connecting to a Linksys WRT320N - no problems out of the box.  Just follow the instructions.  The wireless range from camera to router seems to be about the same as from my notebook to router.  As with all network cameras, users view the live image or video by connecting to the camera's internal web server through any standard web browser.  The Panasonic web interface allows you to view a single camera, or multiple Panasonic cameras at the same time.  If motion detection is something you are interested in, you'll be happy to know that the camera's built-in web interface captures and will send still images or a notification message to your e-mail when movement is detected.  It also records a few minutes of the most recent movement activity detected.  The motion detection works very well and is reliable.  I have not looked at the software on the CD that ships with the camera, but reviewer Scoosdad has helpfully commented that it ships with video recording software that is functional (see comments section).  Overall, I am very happy with this pan/tilt network camera.  There are other pan/tilt network cameras that cost less than the Panasonic, but network cameras are really one of those things where \"\"you get what you pay for\"\".  Great job Panasonic!PS: The number of shills on both sides (positive and negative) for this particular product is getting pretty ridiculous.  Read through all the reviews and comments, it's not too hard to pick out who the paid reviewers are.  For example, there's the non-native English speaking guy who makes the same spelling and grammatical mistakes in every review using his twenty accounts.  I won't name names, it's pretty easy to figure out who it is.  And then there are the pro-Panasonic guys who are maybe a little *too* into this camera.  Come on guys, just make a better product instead of wasting your time on paid reviews.\"", "I purchased the camera to monitor my mom when I am at work. I am a caregiver, so I thought this camera would be a good idea. I must say, the average person will not get this camera working without help! I had to call Panasonic tech support 3 times before I got someone who could tell me what the problem was to get the camera working wireless. I love the camera and how it works, once you get it set up. If you purchase one call Panasonic for help and if the first guy can't help call again.", "\"I wanted a \"\"nanny cam\"\" to monitor a new nanny, but felt a little uncomfortable about having one of the hidden ones.  I felt that having a visible camera known to the nanny was a more respectful approach, although I would need several of them to monitor multiple areas since the locations would be known (and could potentially be avoided).The Panasonic BL-C230A seemed like a great choice as it is from a major international brand and the reviews of its other wired and wireless cameras indicated that they were well received.PROS1. It's cute - It could star as a character in a Japanese cartoon.  The nanny cam is a cube about 3\"\" x 3\"\" x 3 1/4\"\" (approximately) and actually looks cute with its single eye and single antenna that looks like an ear.  It has a high quality look to it with its high gloss white finish and reminds me of a smaller version of an old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock.  It actually looks like it belongs on a nightstand in the bedroom or in a kitchen.  It does not look out of place in a home and does not have a \"\"tech\"\" feel to it.  I think this is a major plus as I really don't want the nanny to feel like I'm trying to determine if she is a terrorist.2. Uses Wi-Fi 802.11 b only, g only, b/g both3. Free lifetime use of Panasonic's \"\"dynamic DNS server\"\" - (more on this later)4. Easy setup (maybe) - Easy to use paper instructions limited to 3 sheets of paper (of which only 2 are necessary).  Sheet 1 shows step-by-step instruction on how to plug the camera into your router with a cable (not supplied and necessary even for wireless in the setup phase) and to connect the power cable.  Sheet 2 is the sheet on how to configure the camera using your computer.  This is the part that has the potential to be alarming or at least uncomfortable if you're not lucky enough to have UPnP (universal plug and play) on your router.  (More on this later.)5. Great interface with web browsers - Once your device is set up for internet access (more on this later) it has a fairly intuitive interface using Internet Explorer with an Active X control (and also on my Apple Safari although I used my PC with Vista for the camera setup with my Apple Mac for the router changes).  There is a viewing screen that allows for 3 resolutions (192x144, 320x240, 640x480).  There is a graphical control on the left of the viewing screen with arrows up/down and left/right for tilt and pans.  What's nice is there is an auto tilt and auto pan button that will cause the camera to sweep back and forth quickly to give a quick overview of the room.  Clicking on a part of the viewing screen will redirect the camera to focus on that spot.  There is also multi-camera support for what appears to be up to 16 separate cameras.6. Fantastic image quality!  (It is definitely grainy in low-light, but that's to be expected.)7. Infrared body heat detection system - does not work if using only browsers but works well using the optional record software install8. Sound detection - Camera can be set to record not just with body movement triggers but sound triggers.9. Zoom ability - Only with the optional recording software installed.  Does not zoom using browsers only.10. Audio - (Not on iPhone browser or Google Chrome, however)11. Mountable - Comes with mounting screws and a safety wire in case it falls from your wall12. Seems to be Apple compatible (except the initial setup and for video recording which appears to require installation of software different from using just a web browser, although I have not yet tested the video recording feature yet) - Works on my Apple Safari web browser as well as Internet Explorer (with Active X).The system requirements written on the outside of the Panasonic box seem to indicate only Windows XP SP2 and Vista with Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 are compatible, but this may be true only for the additional software to set up video recording and the initial camera setup. The browsers seem adequate so far for just watching streaming video and taking still photos as well as maneuvering the camera. I cannot get sound, however, using my Apple iPhone Safari browser or Google Chrome on my PC.  Sounds works well on Internet Explorer with Active-X.CONS1. Setting the camera up for internet access outside of your home can either be very easy or can be scary for technophobes.  Your router must support something called UPnP, Universal Plug and Play for this to work smoothly (I imagine).  When I say smoothly, I mean, being able to follow the step-by-step instruction on sheet #2.  If you do NOT have a router that supports UPnP then the step-by-step instructions basically tell you to go to the manual on the CD which gives a great introduction on private IP addresses, WAN addresses, static IP addresses, and the usefulness of something called a \"\"dynamic DNS server\"\".If you are now thinking that you will be over your head by all of this jargon, realize that most routers support UPnP and thus you can follow the step-by-step instructions which use an \"\"automatic\"\" mode in the configuration steps using your web browser.  I am using an Apple Airport Base Extreme which does NOT support UPnP.  My experience was that it required about 10 extra minutes for me to figure out that I needed to set up something like \"\"port mapping\"\" for my Apple router.2. Although this is a \"\"wireless\"\" network camera, the description is slightly deceptive.  It is wireless only in the networking sense.  I should have thought about this more carefully, because what I really expected was a \"\"cordless\"\" camera.  This camera has a powercord attached to it, although is \"\"wireless\"\".3. It seems that there are 2 versions of video recording software that is an optional install. Oddly, the one for single camera support versus multiple (16) camera support are compatible with different Windows versions.4. I have installed the optional software to my Windows Vista PC to support up to 16 cameras and found that the software works well and is intuitive to use for motion-detection recording.  The software appears to be fine for my uses, but you have to pay for a retail version of the software if you want expanded features such as the ability to export their video data files to JPEG or MPEG format, or if you want to use their video backup feature.  (I have separate third party software that mirrors my internal hard drives to external drives, so the lack of a built-in video backup feature is not critical to me.)  I have not yet tried to see if this optional recording software will work with Bootcamp or VMWare on my Apple Macbook Pro.TIPSFor those of you who also use an Apple Airport Base Extreme (which does not support UPnP), here's what I had to do:A. Launch \"\"Airport Utility\"\" software from my Mac then select \"\"Manual Setup\"\"B. Select \"\"Advanced\"\" from the top tabC. Select \"\"Port Mapping\"\" from a sub-tabD. Click on the \"\"+\"\" to add a device to this mapping so that an outside computer can access my device and is thus \"\"mapped\"\"E. In the drop-down menu select \"\"Personal Web Sharing\"\"F. Make sure the \"\"public\"\" and \"\"private TCP\"\" ports have the same number such as \"\"80\"\" in the text fields (which they do by default if you selected \"\"Personal Web Sharing\"\"G. Save and update the modem (requires restart)H. Go to the installation CD for the Camera and using Internet Explorer to configure the camera, choose \"\"Setup\"\" from the top in the web pageI. Select \"\"Static\"\" and NOT \"\"Automatic Setup\"\" and type in a number such as \"\"80\"\" into the \"\"Port No.\"\" field, and saveJ. Go to the \"\"Internet\"\" tab of the web pageK. Select \"\"Disable\"\" from the \"\"Auto Port Forwarding (IPv4) option.  This is DIFFERENT from the step-by-step instructions given which only work for those who have UPnP.L. Select \"\"Register with ...........com\"\"M. Select \"\"Save\"\"N. You will then be directed to the \"\"..............com\"\" website which is Panasonic's \"\"Dynamic DNS server\"\" which basically will allow your router if it does not support UPnP to work.  This website is also how you will be able to view your camera using a web browser outside of your home and local network.CONCLUSIONI am impressed enough to have ordered two additional \"\"wireless\"\" cameras.  Its ease of use with the iPhone's standard web browser is simply awesome.  My colleagues at work were so impressed by it that they have also placed orders for the device within hours of them seeing for themselves the streaming video on my iPhone and on my desktop at work.I also suspect that my nanny will not feel like I'm some crazy overly zealous parent either, but that I just want a logical way to check up on the kids.  It is a non-intimidating appearing piece of houseware that just seems fun and entertaining while being a legitimate surveillance camera.I hope this review was of some help!\"", "These are great wired cameras, but the wireless connectivity doesn't work (at least not with a D-Link DIR D-655 and WPA, and the June 2010 firmware). PoE is not included so overall this is less functional and more expensive than the BL-C210A. It's going back.", "\"I've had the previous model BL-C130A for a few years, and it has served me well.  I purchased this one a few months ago, and it was easy to set up -- mainly because it was similar to the previous unit.  Quite frankly, the setup can be be challenging and time consuming to get things just right, but the results are worth it.This unit has lots of very useful features including presets, sound, motion detection.  Once everything is set up properly with your router, and the included Panasonic DNS service, everything can be done remotely.  I use it at my vacation home at Tahoe to keep track of weather, and activity around the house.  If anyone / anything get's near the house, the camera sends me pictures (emails) at the rate of 1 per second as the motion sensor is activated.  Also, if it starts snowing, I can see it real time, and activate melt systems using a remote automation system by Universal Devices -- highly recommended.  Also, with the sound, I can check on my fake dog (bear deterent), or if I have a woodpecker problem.This camera C230A is very similar to my previous model (C130A), and does have some improvement such as a secured connection (HTTPS) if so desired.  Both do the WPA2 security.  BTW, I stopped using MAC filtering, because it was just more trouble than it was worth, and redundant with the WPA2.The one thing I wish this model had was wireless \"\"N\"\" -- just has b and g.  I have to move the router on the desk by checking the signal on the camera to get it just right. There is a utility under \"\"maintenence / wireless\"\" that gives you signal info that's very helpful. Panasonic does a good job of improving firmware so check for updates every few months. All in all a very good unit.\"", "It's been installed in our kitchen for about a year now. Just imagine that you've driven miles away from home to catch a movie and then your wife told you that she is not sure if she remembered to turned off the oven.  With this camera, I can see my kitchen oven on my smartphone and knowing right away if I need to turn around or not.Well, the sad part is that I realized that my blackberry browser can not support the video display from this camera. I've tried the different vidoe formats offered by this camera but haven't found one that changes the situation. I believe this is a blackberry restriction. However, through my windows laptop, the video works really well. I've used it to monitor my house when we are away on vacations.The installation, together with wireless connection, was very easy. Basically, you just plug in the network cord, the power cord, and wait for the led to turn green and that's it. For the wireless connection, you do need to connect it first on the wired network, then set up the wireless authentication via your web browser. After that, you can just place the camara anywhere in the house as long as there is a power plug in reach.A very nice thing that Panasonic has done is that the camera comes with a free Dynamic DNS service FREE FOREVER. This means you can create a DNS name you choose to connect to your camera anywhere on the Internet. Yes, a password is required to access the camera.You can set up triggers (motion detection, timer) and response actions (image transfer, notification). Image transfer supports email, FTP and HTTP transfer. Notification supports email and http notification. It means that when the camera is triggered by motion detection for example, the camera will notify you and send you the captured images right away. With email SMTP services that mostly comes free with your Internet Service Provider and others that offer large amount of free online archive storage nowadays, what I chose is email image transfer and email notification using my Verizon SMTP service and Yahoo email account.To set up the motion detection trigger with image transfer and notification with Verizon and Yahoo, follow the following steps: (I'll skip some steps that are already explained well by the on-screen instructions)first connect your browser to the cameraset up > trigger > motion detection > enable image buffer/transfer >choose 'send email notification' at the bottom of page >Email Transfer'SMTP server IP Address or Host Name' > outgoing.verizon.net'Port number' > 587'Reply Email Address' > xxxx@yahoo.com'Destination Email Address1' > xxxx@yahoo.comHow to Authenticatechoose 'SMTP authentication''Login ID' > your Verion id  without @verizon.net)'Password' > your passwordthen 'Save' and that's it.Now you will receive email notification and images sent to your Yahoo email everytime there is a trigger. Besure to tune how many images you want to transfer. If not, you can get over 100 images in just few seonds. The camera also has built-in memory buffer that stores captured images. So, you may just choose to receive email notifications and then access the camera for the captured images.The camera also comes with a PC application that you can install and runs on a PC. It can be set up to stay onnected to your camera all the time and it has a separate motion detection machnism. You can save and archive catured images as well as save the live video feed around the clock if you choose (only limited by your harddisk size) as a surveillance camera.The image quality is very good and sufficient in my opinion for general requirements. You can monitor the audio input from the camera as well, and its quality and sensitivity is amazing. I can monitor the conversation from people 20ft away from the camara.There is no infra-red on this camara. Even it does, most of them normally won't work well beyond 10 ft. However, the image at low light condition is actually very good. Of course, this is all relative to your requirements. Without comparison, it's really hard to say it's good or not. I can only say it is sufficient for general requirements.There are two things to remember, if you use it as a survellance camara. 1) turn off the blinking light on the front face of the camera via set up so it's not so obvious to the thief you are watching, 2) don't pan/tilt the camera when you are watching, because it would create a noise audiable to anyone in the same room.", "\"I have lots of experience with Panasonic IP cameras, as I own several models.  Generally, they are GREAT, and this camera has some very nice features and overall is a good design.  I do agree with other reviewers about the low-light performance not being up to par with other cameras in the Panasonic line, but that is a minor problem for average use.  The price on this camera is also very good.  The setup woes encountered by some reviewers are not surprising.  It's not a simple task to enable port forwarding on a router and get everything squared away, but this camera is no worse than any other Panasonic cameras in that respect; you just have to know what you're doing (no offense; it is a learning process).All that said, this camera has a very serious design flaw.  There's a large \"\"Privacy\"\" button on the top to turn the camera on and off.  Unfortunately, all of the forces applied to the button get funneled down to a tiny surface-mount switch, which is edge-mounted to a circuit board.  Couple that with the fact that due to RoHS requirements, the switch is attached with lead-free solder (brittle), and you have a recipe for disaster.  If you have one of these cameras and the switch has not broken yet, consider yourself lucky, and use a very light touch when you turn the camera on and off.\"", "I used this camera to monitor my vacation home.  Decent camera, easy setup and remote access.  Panning is great, has brightness and white balance control.  No night vision and moment lights get dim forget it you won't see a thing.  I leave a light on with a timer and can at least see a bit.  Compared to other camera's I think it is one of the better one's.  Panning allows you to see the entire room and eliminate a 2nd camera.  Internet connectivity is simple and almost automatic.  Email and motion sensing work great.  If they made this with night vision it would be perfect...", "Too many technical issues involved.I actually bought this for a friend who needs to monitor the wellbeing of his mom in a different country.(just like someone who needs to keep an eye on the nanny at home...)The installation wasn't as simple as it described.And somehow the network blocked the DDNS setup so when I used the domain name provided by the [...], it got blocked and actually went to something else completely.I like the wireless aspect of it but the viewing angle is just too limited.Also, if you sell this as a wireless unit, don't you think you need a longer power cable?The power cable is fairly short so you need to add your own extension cable to install this high enough for the up-down camera to take ful advantage.The side-side viewing angle could be better.Also, it would be nice to have all of the light indicators in the back instead of the front when everyone knows you are watching them.For the hefty price (I paid $297), I don't think it comes enough features at that price.It would be a good buy if it's under $150.", "\"Do yourself a favor and call panasonic tech support from the getko.  It was the best tech support experience I had.  I bought two BL-C230A cameras and spent 4.5 hours to get it to work in wireless mode and with internet access with no luck.  Although there are hints and tips on comments from reviewers, I couldn't understand all the descriptions given.  Some of the good instructions I received from Panasonic are: First, connect camera to router with ethernet cable, then run EasySetup after you've run the \"\"search for camera\"\" with Panny's provided software.  Look in your router to see what address was given to the cam.  Take the address given and use to gain access to and setting up the camera.  Cut and past your wireless router SSID and key from your wireless router's screen onto the camera's setup screen for wireless setup.  Use 4.2.2.1 as secondary address, which is Panasonic's server address (DON'T use your internet service provider's server address).  Use static IP address.  Go to your router's \"\"port forwarding\"\" tab and select your device's IP address and change the TCP port to 80000, for example.  check your router encryption setting and set the camera accordingly so that it can connect to the router. After these steps are done, then switch from wired connection to wireless connection. Panasonic tech support helped me set up 2 units step by step, and they finally work.  If you do everything properly, it would take less than 10 minutes.  You need to know your router's SSID and key and to access your router's as an admin.  The next step for me is to learn how to access my cameras using an iPhone.  Some people seem to be able to do that.UPDATE:  After a few days of use, I find that connecting to the camera via internet is too iffy.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Each of the two cameras I set up has the same problem.  It's nice to be able to view the cameras using iPhone or iPad, when they work properly.  For the price, I expected it to work flawlessly once setup is completed and the cameras are up and running.  This is likely to be returned to Amazon.com.UPDATE #2:  It appears that signal quality of the BL-C230A camera degrades as it is kept powered on.  I have been puzzled as to why the cameras would stop working after short while.  I pinged them and discovered signals were at 25% to 75% loss.  I then unplugged/plugged their power supply to reboot the cameras.  Alas! After rebooting, signal quality was at 100%!  I think there is a serious bug with this BL-C230A cameras.  I need to call Panasonic and consult with them on this.  Maybe there is a firmware update. In comparison, my cheap Trendnet 110W wireless cameras have been working non-stop for days so far, and signal quality has been at 100% when pinged.\"", "I  would give this item a 5 but for the hopeless instructions. There were glaring omissions. I would not have been able to get things working without having read the Amazon reviews. Particularly troublesome was the failure to mention the steps to take when there was already a Panasonic camera installed on the network. It would be so simple for Panasonic to fix up the instructions based on the Amazon reviews. After following the instructions provided, I spent two hours messing with camera and the router before I could get wireless access.After using the product for a few days, I can say that I find it an improvement over the earlier model. Much higher resolution. You can now use the digital zoom without the image falling apart. But don't try to use the zoom feature with Firefox. It won't work with Firefox, but it works fine with IE.After several months of use, the camera began forgetting its network and Internet addresses. That is a serious problem because I use it for security at a vacation residence. To deal with the problem, I have had to keep a computer running at the residence. I can access that computer remotely and reprogram the camera. Each time I do that, it establishes new network and Internet addresses. A bit of a pain.", "Had great expectations  for the camera but spent many hours trying to make it work wirelssly but could not,and I have good knowledge  about electronics.Went back.", "I've had the best luck with Panasonic cams. I have the first model of this running 24/7 for almost 2 years. So while this new model is still good I have to wonder why they changed it. The first one had a nice design to it while this one is shaped like a cube and is much deeper than the first model making it a little more difficult to install.I am a computer guy and had no problem setting this up. It isn't plug and play and does take some work. You should know how your wireless router works or you will find it frustrating. I can view it directly from any where in the world over the Internet.I find the motion sensor works best as I point them out the window for outside viewing. It FTPs still shots so many per second to my server. On windy days I get a lot as the shade from blowing trees triggers the sensor.If it is built as well as the first model it should bring years of security.", "After 2 hours messing with this I am going to return it. It should have been a clue to me that every single box in the store had a return sticker on it. I could not get it to connect in wireless mode. I was able to use it when hard wired into the router. However, the very poor image quality in low light made me decide it was not worth spending more time to try to get it to work wirelessly. For the price it should have better low light capability. It is a cute cube, but the poor documentation and low light performance was a deal breaker for me.", "Summary - Do not buy if you have a MAC.  The camera software is not supported on MAC.  If you do not care about the camera software, I advise that you do not buy if you have a home network with printers, bluray players, internet TV, smart phones, sling boxes, etc.  The reason is that the DHCP home router will assign an IP address to your camera, and with the MAC installation process, the camera can only be found by trial-and-error of entering each possible IP address until you are lucky enough to find the right one ... Again, the MAc installation process can not automatically find the camera.  When you have 20+ devises on your home network, the Panasonic camera randomly selects an IP address.What did I do - I spent all day saturday trying to make it work.  I design IP networks and i still had all these problems.  On Monday, I spent 5 hours with Panasonic.  Very nice and helpful people, but they simply did not know what to do given that I have so many devices  on my home network .. we could not find the camera.  We gave up.What did amazon do - they were perfect.  They gave me a full refund.Though the process was very disappointing, everyone was professional and very helpful.  Panasonic really did their best to try to figure this out.  I am sure that if I had a PC based network, it would have worked..", "I have owned several IP cameras, so I'm familiar with set up and features.  This one is awesome.  I didn't install ANY software, I just connected it to my router, found the IP address and opened it in Internet Explorer.  It was a simple matter to configure it for wireless, setup the image parameters, and other basic functions.  After about a 5 minute session I went wireless.  It connected and is easy to access and control.  It has an excellent image quality and settings for various white balance scenarios.  There are a LOT of options!  Various alarm options, a remote contact you can open/close, many image settings, motion detection, audio settings, time/date stamp, and DDNS settings.  More settings and options than I can describe here.  You don't need them all, but they're there for advanced users.  Linksys cameras that I've had in the past are mostly just basic image quality and a few minor tweeks.  This camera has a huge array of features.  I highly recommend it.", "This IP camera is reasonably priced and has good features, but has serious WiFi flaws.On the plus side it pans, tilts, sound pickup, and sends e-mail, besides all the other common features.But the negative side is serious. It does not support use of embedded blanks in WPA password, contrary to its documentation example and the standards.And it sends both WiFi and LAN MAC addresses from one WiFi interface. This is against the standards and causes problems. Then WiFi MAC disappears after a while and it only works using the LAN MAC even in WiFi mode.Even worse is that this is known to Panasonic yet they are refusing to fix.The tech support person was technically excellent but he kept side-stepping the issue of the product not working according to the standards or its own documentation. Apparently all their cameras use the same firmware base code and the problem exists on other models as well.All products have issues but this is the first company I dealt with that refused to fix something that is in the specification. Wow, what a target for class-action sharks.Suggest staying away from this product-line, or at least stick with non-WiFi version."], "Gamma": [0.0781678780913353, 0.05978725105524063,
