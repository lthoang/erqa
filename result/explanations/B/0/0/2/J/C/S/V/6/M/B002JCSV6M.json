It is sooo much better in terms of construction. Its solid, controls have a reassuring feel. It makes focus decisions in split seconds and takes pictures on demand and rapidly. It is a little disappointing the Sensor is still the old one like the D90 but it is still much more satisfying than my D80. The video feature is less useful than one would think, but its nice to have. Be aware auto focus does not work when you are filming. The button layout is not conducive to video and holding the camera steady. But this is a great camera for picture taking. Well made, solid and DX format so my old lenses still work.

That's a big leap.", "Ok, the Nikon D300 is fine, but this 300S is Awesome.Please for your own sake ask your seller what kind he or she has before you buy, I emailed 2 before I found one that actually had a 300S on here.I understand buyers being mislead by the similar name but how in the world are Sellers, who OWN the product not know what camera they have???Now my First Impressions:The 300s is one of the better cameras I have ever had the opportunity to use, I made the switch to Nikon recently after getting a 60D and thinking it was great until I got my hands on this bad boy. I could go into a novel of features but instead I will list a few (most of which are NOT available on the D300)of the BEST FEATURES:1. HD video at the touch of a button! No changing dials and switches. In live mode just tap a button and it starts right away. Cool.2. TWO memory cards!! It accept an SD card and a CF card at the same time and you can program what goes into each. So handy, and I just never knew.3. There's a shortcut button for everything! Flash adjustment, Multi-Exposure adjustment, AF lock, AE lock (So you can set your focus of exposure and then move to a different location and it stay until you tell it not to anymore).4. Wireless flash transmitter BUILT-IN. This is huge and you don't know what it is until someone gives you a fancy external flash to use and you can just sit it on the table and it fires without a pricey transmitter sticking out the top of your camera.Those are the top things that I can think of that blow that Canon and the D300 out of the water for me.Try one out for yourself!", "\"This camera is amazing.  Auto-focus, blazing fast and always accurate.  I don't know how it does it, but it nails the focus every time no matter what I'm shooting.  With other camera I would always you center-point AF and focus and recompose.  With the D300s I leave it on auto-area and get perfect focus every time.  High iso, one of the best in it's class, better than any Canon cropped sensor camera, and equal to Nikon's own D90/D5000.  This thing is built like a tank, it's tough and will last you for years to come unless you throw it in the middle of a highway.  It's shoots more frames per second then I will ever need, but if you're serious about sports photography this camera is for you.  The image quality is best in it's class.  Compared to the Canon 7D the Nikon D300s gives sharper pictures with less noise and great detail over iso 400.  The 7D photos to my eye looked too \"\"digital\"\" and processed.  Where the D300s always gives a natural film like quality to it's images.  The color, contrast, sharpness, and exposure all seem much better to me on the D300s than the 7D.Then only downside to this camera is the video.  Like all DSLRs that can shoot video, it can't auto-focus while shooting making it useless for all but the most hardcore video experts and film makers.  It also suffers from \"\"rolling shutter\"\" while shooting video, but I don't really care because I don't buy picture camera to shoot video, I buy them to take pictures.  No other camera beats the D300s in this price range at this time in my honest opinion.\"", "love this camera...I previously had a D90 and the external methods of changing setting and modes on this camera is great...I would have given it a 5 but I haven't upgraded the lenses yet that might make it unbeatable.update:  the fast shooting and the two memory card slots give me a lot of versatility/storage while shooting fast moving targets...the histogram allows me to make sure my WB is set properly even tho I do not do a lot of RAW shooting or in camera processing at this time..update:  I have now upgraded my lenses and this thing takes fantastic shots....with ease....set up your custom shooting menus and modify on the fly and get great shots.....", "I got this body only as I already had several Nikon lenses.  I was using Canon and have now thought about going back to them.  This camera is great with one exception.  I find you have to continually clean the sensor grid due to dust or whatever flies onto it.  Sending it to Nikon all the time is expensive and you loose the use of the camera for an extended period of time.  Being as careful as I can when changing lenses I feel like I need to be in a clean room.  This has turned out to be a big turnoff for me going back to Nikon products.", "\"There are plenty of very good comprehensive reviews here of the D300S here already, so I'm instead of posting another I'm going to attempt to focus on what I see as some of the pros and cons of the D300S versus other camera bodies in the Nikon line-up.  The D300S has essentially identical image quality to the $500 D5000 and the now quite old (in DSLR terms) D300 and D90; and it remains a small-format DX camera while the next step up in price gets you a full-frame D700.  Even so, my personal choice for the majority of my photography is a D300S rather than any of those alternatives.  I have also owned and shot with every other camera mentioned here: all are excellent and I believe all can be considered good values for the money spent in today's market.  Perhaps some readers would find my perspective useful.As far as I'm concerned, image quality from Nikon DSLRs has really been quite excellent at least since the introduction of the D70.  Of course there have been all kinds of incremental improvements since then, but comparing anything since the D70 to the funky highlights produced by the earlier D100, for example, makes it clear that we have long since reached the point of diminishing returns when it comes to real, visible improvements in DSLR image quality.  In terms of the finer points it will continue to improve, but whether you buy a D5000, a D300S or a D700, the differences between the images you can make with the camera are going to be tiny compared with the differences in how you can use it - with the exception of the FX-vs-DX field of view, which is very important.What I think most people will benefit from is carefully assessing the features and physical capabilities of the various bodies, considering the types of photography they like to do, and selecting the best match for their particular needs.  Budget, of course, enters the equation: but for many photographers the small, light D5000 would be the best choice regardless of budget, while of course others will absolutely require the pro features of the more expensive bodies.D300S vs D700; DX vs FX - By far the most fundamental issue in camera body selection:This is the one real difference between the shooting capabilities of any of the bodies I'm writing about here, and it affects every image you make with the camera once you buy it.  I would strongly advise readers NOT to look at format as a camera issue, but to look at it as a lens issue.  Of course there are differences between the FX and DX bodies, even those closest in specification, and to some degree it's possible to equalize lens selection: but when you begin to look at the practical realities of lens selection for DX vs FX formats, it is immediately apparent that they operate in completely different worlds.  I'm convinced that this should be one's primary consideration when choosing a camera, assuming that your budget allows you a choice between the formats.The heart of the matter is that it really is much easier to make a great DX lens than it is to make a great FX lens.  The basic physics guarantees it.  The DX format is 2/3 the linear size of the FX format, meaning that, all else being equal, lenses will have to be 3.4 TIMES BIGGER (1.5^3) in FX format to exactly equal the optics on DX of a DX format lens.  Because lens design is a matter of careful compromise between many factors mainly size, price, max aperture, zoom ratio, sharpness, and weight; real-world FX lenses aren't made 3.4 times bigger, heavier and more expensive than DX lenses.  They are instead made only considerably bigger, with compromises in other aspects of design - so that they must give up some aspect of performance: zoom ratio, max aperture, optical excellence - to achieve their design objectives.Because of this, there is really no FX equivalent to the excellent 16-85mm VR DX lens (the 24-120VR is a fairly mediocre lens despite being physically larger).  Likewise the 35mm f/1.8 has come out being a slightly better lens than the 50mm f/1.4G despite being smaller and lighter (though slower, unfortunately).  Many excellent wide zooms now exist for DX cameras at affordable prices, while the selection of FX wide zooms has one choosing between obscenely heavy and expensive excellent lenses and \"\"normally\"\" priced average lenses.  This conundrum spans the entire range of available lenses, and it is likely never to change or to resolve in favor of FX because it is driven by the basic physics of optics and their design and manufacture.For this reason, DX cameras have tremendous advantages if you want to shoot lenses that are reasonably priced, that give excellent sharpness and overall image quality, that have flexible zoom ranges, and that are light and compact enough to transport and use unobtrusively.FX, on the other hand, will be marketed as the premier format, and I think we can expect that most of the very best lenses made will continue to be FX lenses.  Very fast primes, f/2.8 zooms built to pro specifications, long telephotos and the best macro lenses will all be FX.  FX lenses can of course be used on DX cameras, but that realization leads to the other FX advantages.  While the DX \"\"crop factor\"\" gives DX bodies a presumed advantage in the telephoto range, it conversely gives FX cameras a sizeable advantage within the \"\"normal\"\" ranges most people do most of their shooting at.  A 50mm lens on FX equals a 35mm lens on DX in terms of field of view, but allows for much better control of subject isolation than the DX lens.  Likewise, a \"\"fast wide\"\" lens on FX such as the new 24mm f/1.4G becomes a much less exotic creature on DX, and probably rather pointless as a consequence.  For portraiture, the selection of lenses for FX is wonderful, if expensive, whereas DX shooters must compromise by using lenses not designed for their native format.For photographers who shoot mostly in the normal ranges, who want to maximize their control of depth of field (especially towards the wide end), who don't mind paying a premium for the most expensive equipment, and who are willing to put up with the weight and the conspicuousness of shooting with pro-level equipment as well as the compromises inherent in FX lens design, FX will continue to be the only option.There is one more advantage currently in shooting FX, in that the FX sensors are more light-sensitive than the DX sensors, enabling shooting at tremendous ISOs, well above the DX level.  This will probably always remain so: the FX sensor is bigger, and can gather more light.  Whether this is important to a particular user really depends on the types of photography they like to do, but it should be appropriately factored into the decision.  Likewise FX cameras have larger viewfinders, which will probably never be possible on DX cameras: another luxury of FX shooting that does not directly translate to the images that can be produced.Personally, having been a film shooter in the past, I find my needs more than satisfied by DX bodies, at least for the time being.  A selection of excellent, lightweight lenses suffices for the vast majority of my photography, while I can put up with the compromises inherent in some parts of the range, especially for fast wide shooting.  I'd like some fast prime lens options in the range of 16-28mm for DX but I can live with their absence considering the cost, both financial and in terms of lost flexibility, of switching to FX.D300S vs D300 vs D90My upgrade path went from the D40 through the D90 and D300 and then to the D300S.  I loved every one of those bodies except, notably, the D300, which was in some ways a step backwards in comparison to the D90 and which I was never completely satisfied with.  I do currently have a D700 as well.The D90 is still a great camera, affording the vast majority of capabilities of the D300S, the exceptions being the inherent handling and feature advantages of the pro bodies.  The D90 is also much lighter and physically smaller than the pro bodies, making it a very pleasant camera to shoot, and I would still be using mine were it not for just a couple of relatively minor improvements that make the D300S worth the upgrade for me.  The pro bodies let you define custom setting banks, so that I can switch between different types of shooting easily.  Since I do this daily, this is very important to me.  Switching from an indoor, tripod-mounted shooting configuration to an outdoor, hand-held shooting configuration on a D90 takes a lot of button presses and a couple of minutes, and there is always the very likely possibility of forgetting to change one critical parameter and not realizing it until it's too late.  No matter how serious a photographer you are, if you shoot mostly in similar conditions all the time, or in constantly changing conditions such that pre-defined shooting banks would be useless, then this feature is probably meaningless to you.  It happens to be very useful to me.Likewise the D300S has a couple of features lacking in the D300 that allow for quick settings changes: several shooting parameters (not enough, though) can be changed quickly right on the rear LCD as on the D40/60/3000/5000 bodies, which I find very useful.  Also useful, the D300S' function buttons can be programmed to put you at the top selection of a custom-defined menu.  Between these two features I can access and change almost any of the commonly-altered settings on the D300S (or the D90/D700) very quickly, while the D300 had me hunting through the menu system for far too long.  This alone is a significant upgrade in camera handling for the D300S compared to the D300, and by itself would merit the upgrade in my case.I wish any of these cameras could be programmed so that the LCD info screen would come on automatically between shots as can be done with the D40-style bodies.  I think buyers of higher-end bodies probably consider this an unnecessary or amateur feature, but in my opinion, that is not so at all!  Especially when shooting on a tripod, the info screen is a much quicker and more complete information reference than the top LCD, and especially if ALL the settings could be set directly through it, this would be another extremely valuable aid to quick settings changes.  Today's cameras have so many settings, and they need to be changed so often to get the best possible image, that anything Nikon could do to give users quicker access to more settings would be a step forward for photographers of any experience level.Other major differences between the D90 and D300S are, in order of approximate decreasing importance to me, are: 1) Better focus system on D300 and D300S, 2) External buttons and switches to quickly change focus and meter settings on D300 and D300S, 3) Usefully quicker continuous shooting speed on D300 and even quicker on D300S (4.5fps for D90, 6fps for D300, 7fps for D300S), 4) Decently weather-sealed body on D300 and D300S, 5) Rugged pro build quality on D300 and D300S (comes at a cost, though, much larger and heavier), 6) AF fine-tuning on D300 and D300S.  There are many more differences between the cameras than these, but these are the ones that matter to me.There is one more biggie.  The D300S, unlike either the D300 or D90 (or D700 for that matter), has two memory card slots, and I happen to love the fact that one holds an SD card and the other a CF card.  Most pros prefer CF cards.  I'm not a pro, and I prefer SD cards.  What I love about this feature, though, is that there is a setting which allows the camera to write a jpeg to one card and a RAW file to the other.  I shoot jpeg most of the time but RAW some of the time, and this is by far the easiest way to go between jpeg-only and jpeg-plus-RAW, while ALSO getting all the RAW shots segregated from the jpegs so that you can later decide either to discard them, or to download them to a different folder, at a different time, without any fancy file-download trickery.  When not using this feature the second card can be set to duplicate or to overflow, although I would prefer there to be more flexibility as to which card does what function.While the D300S is the \"\"best\"\" of these bodies in many ways, the features it has over the D90 are just not going to matter to everybody, and the D90 is smaller and lighter enough that it's very seriously worth considering if you don't need them.  The D90 is one of the best-positioned, best bang for the buck bodies Nikon has yet made, while the D300S is a superb camera but gives diminishing returns for the dollar, and by the ounce, in comparison.D300S vs D5000I know beyond any doubt that there are a lot of photographers buying pro cameras that would be much better served with a smaller, easier to use, easier to carry and handle and store body, and if you can't decide whether to start slow or to go all-out with a pro body, you should really take a look at the D5000.  In terms of its ability to capture any given image, the D5000 is the equal of the D300S, and only the time it takes to get that image, or the variety of lenses you can use to do so, really differs.  The handling of the D300S, with its multiplicity of features and settings, is going to slow down, not speed up, the process for people who don't use the camera often enough to stay fluent in the layout of its controls and functions.  The D5000 gives you much of the flexibility, all of the image quality, and less size, cost, and weight.  I personally enjoy the smaller cameras very much.  I prefer their smaller size and only use the larger, heavier bodies because they have capabilities the smaller bodies lack, and those capabilities are important to me.  If those capabilities are of questionable importance to you, consider your needs carefully before you encumber yourself with their extra weight and extra expense.ConclusionI'm going to give the D300S a rating of four stars.  Clearly it is only intended to be a minor upgrade with respect to the D300, and it uses the same now-aging sensor used in all these cameras, so it's natural to expect that it is not a blockbuster on the new camera scene.  It's not intended to be: Nikon has been busy developing FX bodies and adding to its lens line over the past year or two.  This particular corner of the lineup is getting a breather.  It is a tremendously competent camera, the top DX body currently available from Nikon, and an excellent tool for the job of photography under almost all conditions.  It would be surprising not to see an improvement on the subject of sensor technology within the coming months or year, which would be incorporated into a successor in time.  I do think Nikon needs to get to work figuring out ways to make the control interfaces of today's pro cameras more intuitive to use.  Better menu systems, more easily accessed; more flexibility in the use of the rear LCD to view and change settings; more flexibility in the enabling of custom menus and setting banks (which are useful but limited as currently implemented), would be high on my list of improvements.  Nikon by its nature prefers to evolve its cameras incrementally over a period of years, and although that's a good strategy in some ways, other times it means we get stuck with \"\"legacy\"\" after-effects: backwards-reading meters, mechanical lens interfaces, and old style menu systems that have begun to overflow their banks.  Some streamlining of the user experience would make the cameras easier, quicker and more flexible in use.In a relative sense, though, those things remain nitpicks.  The D300S is the best camera for my needs currently on the market.\"", "Bought this camera recently to replace the many years, but still trusty Nikon D200. Took both of them on a road trip recently and was extremely please with the Nikon D300s. The auto focus was super fast and accurate. The video feature was a nice bonus. While I wouldn't use it often, it does come in handy when I want to illustrate to my friends and families certain scenic views I come across.The ability to shoot many frames per second and the auto focus system being able to keep up with it was beyond my own expectation. The picture quality and low level noise was nice. I was able to do ISO-1600 perfectly where I couldn't before using D200.Highly recommend this camera to anyone. [...]", "I already have a D300 which I have been using for a couple of years.  This camera is an incremental improvement.  Yes, it does movies just fine.The controls are about 95% the same as the D300; just a few improvements.  I've owned lots of cameras, this is without a doubt the best!", "I love this camera! I have udes a D200 for the last several years and developed a relationship with it such as an extention of my arm. I'm not good with change and that's just what a move from the D200 to the D300s is, a big change. Not only in the software functions but the functionality and bells and whistles that the D300S comes with. I was planning on waiting for the D400 to come out early next year but from what I hear is that the only major change will be the HD video will go to 1080p.", "\"The D300s is a product improved D300, featuring a movie mode, \"\"info\"\" button, horizon indicator, and so on. Technology wise it's state of the art for 2007.It is a follow-on to the successful D200, and is in every way a major improvement. It still holds it's own today, especially for action and sport shooting.The \"\"why\"\" for me on getting this camera is as a backup for my D700. The real deal breaker was frame rate and compatibility with manual focus lenses. I had a real thought about whether to get this or the D7000. The 7000 has a better movie mode (more on that in a bit) and in the photos released so far it's a stop better in high ISO, and since I do a lot of shooting in poor light that was a big consideration.I finally opted for the 300S because it was compatible with my existing battery grip and compact flash memory cards, could give 8 frames a second, and no matter how much better the 7000 is in ISO it still won't compare to the full frame 700. I have a gut feeling the 7000 won't be as good as some people hope, time will tell if I eat my words.Good Points:A \"\"semi-pro\"\" Nikon, familiar to anyone who's used one in the past 11 years.Almost identical in layout to my D700, makes switching between cameras easy.Does 6FPS by itself, 8FPS with the MB-D10 battery pack and EN-EL4 battery. (It needs the big battery to go faster, just using the grip with AA's or a single EN-EL3 won't do it.)Meters with and has settings to store for manual focus lenses.Shutter is rated to 150,000 frames.Heavy duty build, weather sealing and magnesium alloy body.Dual card slots, so you can use SD/Compact flash either as backups or an automatic \"\"spill over\"\" if you run out. Backup is most useful, in my experience unless you're shooting video, your daily job is taking pictures, or you never download most mortals won't fill up even a 16GB card.\"\"D-lighting,\"\" to enhance dynamic range. I have mixed feelings about this, I like it to lessen blown highlights but overdone it makes images low on contrast, and sometimes I like strong shadows. I usually leave it on the low setting.Not so good points:High ISO that was good for the day but now is so-so. My main objection is at 2000 and above or in dim lighting you start getting muddy colors and yellow blotches. How bad this is depends on your preferences and the type of photo.People coming from a D200 will be blown away at how much better it is. Compared to a contemporary D90 it's apples-n-oranges, maybe a slight edge to the D90. Ultimately the ISO performance was my biggest decision to make in getting the 300s, and it finally came down to I already had a camera for good low light shots.Movie mode---where to begin? The 300s offers an \"\"improved algorithm\"\" to reduce the jello effect/wobbles that plagued the D90, and an external microphone jack. In those respects the 300s is an improvement; wobble is reduced but is still present if you're unsteady. The fame rate is only 24FPS so you will get jerkiness on fast moving objects or if the camera moves very much.Two camps have come up about movie mode in DLSR's; one that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, the other that it's a gimmick. After two years with a D90 and now the 300S I'm leaning towards gimmick. The biggest advantage is using interchangeable lenses for limited depth of field, low light, etc. Otherwise you're better off with a generic camcorder for casual use or spending the money on a high end one with it's own interchangeable lenses if you're that serious.The next big gimmick is full-time auto-focus, all I can say is look at the sample videos if you really think it's an improvement.So aside from my soap box rant about movie mode my only real criticism of the 300s is the ISO, in all other respects it's a good semi-pro camera.\"", "This is a great camera. Why anyone would buy and review it just for the video is beyond me. There are so many features in this camera to be used AS A CAMERA. I agree with others that video is just a nice little add on but has nothing to do with the quality of the camera. I have had mine for over six months and used the video only a couple of times - just for fun.This is the 3rd best camera out there behind the D700 and D3. It's not that expensive for a professional quality camera. Bryan Peterson, Bobbi Lane, among others, use it and look at their photos.I suggest checking out reviews from professionals. Most of us Amazon users are amateurs including the video review.", "What a dream camera and a photographers dream come true. I have been with several other cameras, Digital's before they were SLRs and SLRs. I have been shooting for 23 years now and remember not going digital as I felt they could never replace the feel of film.I guess to be honest the film camera still sits most comfortably in my hands (I think) but since I started with the D80 (in the D series) I never really went back to film.The D700, the product here, is a bit expensive - but if you do serious photography I think well worth the investment. I get the feel that the colors are better than in the lower end models (D70, D80) and the sharpness is really superb - but the issue is that you will need some new lenses.I had decided to invest in this camera and do not regret this. My only regret is that I did not make the jump a little earlier - but for the fees we can be forgiven as a semi-pro.", "This is a very good body, it is very important to learn how to use it. I HIGHLY recommend this body as a DX (APS-C) platform, the only advise I can give you is to read the manual cover to cover. This camera has quite a few advanced shooting capabilities and it can take a little time to get used to all the features and where they are in the extensively deep menu system. I would say that the only downfall is the high ISO performance, although for an APS-C sensor it does very well it is still an APS-C sensor and thus has limitations at higher ISO.", "\"I got the D300s as a back up body to my D700. Very impressed. Aside from the sensor size / ratio difference, the image quality appears comparable with the D700. Heck, it performs so much like the D700, I get the 2 confused sometimes.The unfortunate drawback is the video capabilities. Awful, considering the times. Nikon shouldn't have even bothered coming out with this \"\"s\"\" version. My tiny point and shoot camera does a better job of handling video.I'll stick to only shooting photos, with which Nikon does excel.A bit about the video capabilities:Nikon chose to use motion jpeg for the video codec: although more compatible for editing purposes, it is more compressed and picks up more image \"\"artifacts\"\". And only 720p? Come on! With Nikon's amazing glass and beautiful imaging chip, what a waste! You might as well be shooting with a point and shoot body.Video autofocus  is a joke. We took 2 steps backwards in AF technology. I know, I know, I'm aware you cannot piggy-back off the photo still AF system during live view video capture, thus having to use a secondary \"\"contrast detection\"\" system. But video camera manufacturers have already found solutions a long time ago. Nikon needed to look to them and taken some time to apply it in their DSLRs rather than rush slap it in, just to jump on the HD video bandwagon early on.You can always manually focus. (How most hollywood films are shot) Very difficult to hold steady while trying to focus / zoom / track while recording. Your success will be dependent on how well you can track, pull focus, etc. For which you'll need an external monitor or screen magnifier. Basically, I am limited to very static shots.The \"\"jello effect\"\" is terrible. Try quickly panning sideways, you'll see what I mean. (There are some good examples on youtube\"\"Built in mic sound is atrocious. But that is to be expected. Easily remedied by using a good external mic.Yes you can get some great \"\"cinema style\"\" shallow depth of field shots, and shoot low light and such, but that's because of the lens choices and DSLR form factor. As for the actual video quality: very poor and way behind.All in all, if you are looking for the best still DSLR in this price range, The D300s is it.
