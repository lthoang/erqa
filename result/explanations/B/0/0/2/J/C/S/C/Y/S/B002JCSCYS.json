Overall a great looking keyboard and mouse. Highly recommend!!", "\"This combination replaced my earlier Microsoft Desktop keyboard and mouse.  The mouse is identical to my last one (which still functions perfectly).  The keyboard is a bit smaller than my Comfort 4000, has fewer features (which I never used anyway), and is quieter.First, the good things:* Quiet  This keyboard is very quiet*Responsive  It responds to a light touch*Compact  Has a fairly small footprint for a full-featured keyboardThe mouse:* Works well  Tracks on just about any surface*Positive clicks  Provides a satisfying audible click*Ergonomic  Fits my big hands wellThe \"\"Not so good\"\" Mouse feature:* No way to shut off the mouse without removing the batteries.  Dumb design I would have hoped MS would have fixed.The \"\"Not so good\"\" Keyboard features:*No indicator lights  If cap or num lock is on, you get a brief indication on the screen.  That's it.  No indicator lights*F keys layout  It's one continuous line, not broken into groups of 3 and 4 keys.*F key height  Is LOWER than the keys in front of of them.  What idiot designed this setup?*Escape Key  Same height as the F keys.  I DARE you to use it without hitting the key in front of it.  AWFULI am not a gamer, so I can't speak to the usability of this keyboard for that purpose.  But as a keyboard used primarily used for typing, it works well (other than the ESC key).The wireless function works flawlessly.  No complaints whatsoever.My recommendation would be this: if you are a gamer, or if you use the F keys or the special function keys, pass on this keyboard.  It isn't going to please you.  If you are using it just for typing, get a keyboard without all the special function keys.  Why pay for something you don't need and will have difficulty using?I will keep this keyboard and put up with the poorly designed ESC key.  When it comes time to replace this keyboard, I will look for a simple, wireless keyboard without the extras I don't use anyway.Overall, I'd rate the mouse as a 4.5 and the keyboard as a 3.5.  Price wise, it is still a good value.\"", "This is a great keyboard. I wasn't really looking for a mouse. I'm not using the mouse but did test it out. It was ok. I understand other reviewers point regarding the scroller. Going back to the keyboard, I wanted to get an ergonomic keyboard for someone who can't type very well and can use the visual hints like Copy CTRL-C, Paste CTRL-V. So if your skills are elementary and someone could program keys for you; then this is a great buy. Gamers won't like the function keys. They feel just a little smaller than a standard keyboard. The part that I didn't like is that I'm so used to typing on a regular keyboard and not needing to constantly look down as I type that the new bent ergonomic design made me misspell words, making me look at the keyboard more often, hence typing slower. But that could be just me and not hold true for others. Just the same, my wife likes using it very much.", "This item was well packaged and easy to install on any computer. The mouse and keyboard are both comfortable and well designed.", "This keyboard and mouse combination gave nearly two years of service with no problems. Then the keyboard went through two sets of batteries in as many months.Pros:--full function keyboard; high customization of additional function keys and many peripheral control commands can be invoked through keyboard.-Single transceiver unit for both the mouse and keyboard; both can be controlled and only a single USB port is needed.-Full size mouse good for users with large hands.-Wireless..so less desktop and computer read clutter.Cons:-Keyboard suddenly developed an insatiable thirst for batteries. Not a big deal, but one of the users in our environment is mobility impaired, and changing batteries adds to this challenge.-Keyboard height adjustment requires removing (instead of simply folding) rubber legs...high possibility for loss.Notes:(1) An alternative wireless keyboard option that uses *no* consumables is theLogitech K750. It'ssolar powered, so *never* needs batteries.(2) An alternative wireless mouse claiming 3-year battery life is theLogitech M705. Mine currently indicates 663 days of battery life remaining (1.8 years). This is 586 days after I began using it (1.6 years)...so the 3-year claim seems to be holding up.", "Keyboard is sturdy and durable, great shape and size and very comfortable to use. Been using it for over a month now and no problems at all, very satisfied with the product.Keys are slightly noisy compared to other keyboards I've used. The arrow keys and page keys (page up, home, end) are in non-standard positions and is annoying at first, but easily adaptable over a couple weeks of use. If you frequently switch between keyboards though it may become very frustrating.", "\"Not being a techie, this review will be based on the experiences of an average Joe or Jane trying this keyboard on for size.Pros:1. Excellent packaging.  Easy to open, and is packed in a compact and attractive box.  Would make a great gift.2. Nice comfortable palm rest and key positioning.  The removable feet required a bit of reading of the instructions to set up, but this was relatively easily accomplished. Note: Be careful you don't throw out the feet with the packaging.3. Easy set up.  Up and running in minutes.4. Works with batteries, so no need to store and locate a charger when the mouse runs out of steam. (As compared to the Logitech model)5. Handy buttons for MS Office, such as cut, copy, paste, undo, bold, italic and underline (et al) right on the keyboard. (as dual key functions)6. Media keys and volume controls on keyboard, also low battery indicator light.7. Compact footprint, so it can fit most workstations.Cons:1. Can you say \"\"dust magnet\"\"?  This thing picks up dust and fingerprints like crazy, especially on the shiny bits.2. Lack of detailed instructions for the keyboard and mouse.  It comes with adequate set-up instructions, but expects you to know what to do after that.  I'd have appreciated some included info on the keyboard functions.3. No lights for Caps lock and Num lock4. Mouse has no on/off switch (that I can find), so when I turned it over and put in the batteries (2 x AA included) I nearly blinded myself with the blue laser.  Note: It turns off when the receiver is stored in the base.5. Mouse is obese.  Hard for small hands to deal with, and not ergonomic.Note:I don't have Windows 7 as yet, but it's nice to know that whenever I get it, the keyboard has special \"\"hot keys\"\" to allow easy access to programmes.Overall, a good keyboard/mouse combination for the price, with more positive features than negative if you're an average computer user.  I can't speak for Gamers or Techies, but I like it.Amanda Richards, January 3, 2010\"", "I got this set to use while surfing with the PS3.  Setup couldn't be easier.  I installed the batteries, plugged the connector into the USB port, and it just worked.  The keyboard is slim, rigid, and very comfortable.  The mouse is big, and has a decent heft, but fits my hand well.  The build quality is great.  It's much better than typing with a PS3 controller.", "\"I have been using theLogitech Cordless Desktop Wave Setfor a while on my desktop and have recently added this Microsoft set to my laptop.The Microsoft keyboard is smaller and lighter, and I find it just slightly less comfortable as the Logitech keyboard, whose keys are laid out with a slight depression (the \"\"wave\"\" design) to fit your fingers more comfortably. If you want the Microsoft keyboard to sit at an angle, you must attch optional rubber feet to the bottom of the keyboard (I had to look hard to find them in the box as they are well-hidden); on the Logitech they are built-in and retractable. The function keys on the Microsoft keyboard are unusually small and lower than the rest of the keys, making them a little difficult to use. There are some function keys designed to work with the Windows 7 taskbar, and the optional software lets you customize the function of many of the keys. The keyboard is comfortable and responsive.The mouse is not quite as comfortable for my hand as the one that comes with the Logitech set. The forward and backward buttons on the left and right sides of the mouse are not quite as easy for me to reach as on the Logitech, but this may be good, as I am prone to press them by accident on the Logitech mouse. The scroll wheel works extremely quietly and smoothly, and the optional software lets you customize the behavior of all the buttons and the scroll wheel. The mouse uses \"\"Microsoft Bluetrack Technology\"\" and tracks exceptionally well, even over unusual surfaces such as fabric.I think this is a fine desktop set. The removable keyboard feet and small function keys are minor quibbles that kept my rating at 4 rather than 5 stars.\"", "I like the slightly curved design of these keyboards, it makes it a bit easier on my strained wrists without having to learn a truly split keyboard. I also wanted this because it has a standard inverted-T cursor pad and home/end/insert/delete buttons where they should be. Also like the built-in wrist rest and wireless connection.The one thing that drives me nuts, and which I didn't catch when I reviewed the item, is that they made the function keys half height and half depth, making it extremely awkward to operate. I constantly use these and now have to look where to push to hit the right spot. Why do they have to keep f*&^%g with the design of these standardized keys? Drives me nuts. By default, they are also configured to be specialty keys (browser back/forth etc), instead of the standard F1, F2... function (with special key to turn that off!). In addition, the soft-touch keys across the very top are oversized by comparison, larger than any other key on that keyboard and - for me at least - utterly useless, as I rarely use them. Programmable and everything, I am tempted to try programming them to be the function keys.I wish they could make one standard *backward-compatible* design and stop fuzzing with it.", "\"If you're familiar at all with Microsoft peripherals then you won't be surprised by the Wireless Desktop 5000.  It's the same deal -- crappy mouse and a great keyboard.  I have actually reviewed the Wireless Desktop Keyboard 6000 as well so if you click on my profile, you should be able to find it.  Regardless, I actually find the 5000 keyboard to be superior simply because of a better button layout.  If wireless is what you're going for, I would actually recommend to forgo the Desktop 5000 package for a cheaper Keyboard-only package.  If not, and wired is what you prefer, I would recommend saving $30 and buying the Comfort Curve 2000.  They all have the excellent and ergonomic curved design, and they all have very nice keys as well (with regard to sound and \"\"pressability\"\").When it comes to peripherals, Microsoft does pretty well I must say.  They definitely hold their own against my favorite peripheral maker, Logitech.  And they have a nicer selection of ergonomic designs than Logitech does.  The 5000 is no different.  What I like most about the 5000 over the 6000 is that all the shortcut and special keys like Volume +/- are larger and more easily found tactilely.  The 6000 has a row of featureless buttons at the top and the volume buttons (the most used ones) are kind of hidden amongst the others.  On the 5000, however, the volume buttons are on the end, and they are larger and easier to press.  So it's a much better design in my opinion.  In addition, the 1-5 \"\"favorite\"\" buttons have an indented feature to them that distinguishes them from the rest.The wireless receiver with this set is also on par with Microsoft's other wireless products.  It has great range and is very good at minimizing interference, which is a big deal.  Unfortunately, I'm only able to test the interference in Wireless-G or 2.4Ghz range.  I don't know how it fares against Wireless-N, but I imagine it does pretty well.  The book seems to indicate that it operates in 27MHz and 2.4Ghz, but it doesn't seem to come out and say it explicitly.So, ya, this is a great keyboard.  The mouse however is a piece of garbage in my opinion.  They boast \"\"BlueTrack Techology\"\", the \"\"world's most advanced tracking\"\".  But that's a fallacy because Logitech has \"\"Dark Field\"\" tracking technology that works on glass.  But the tracking was least of my concerns.  I need a comfortable and usable mouse.  The mouse with the 5000 is neither.  It has loud, hard clicks and is just a clumsy, uncomfortable beast.  In addition to the thumb button, there's also a pinkie button.  I don't know if that's for lefty thumbs or what, but it's really a bad place for a button.  So, like the 6000, the mouse is worthless.  It also has a soft scroll-wheel just so you know.To sum up: great keyboard, awful mouse.  This would be a fine package if you don't already have a mouse that you like.  But if you do, I would recommend getting just the keyboard and save yourself the $15 or $20.\"", "Setup was a breeze.....My computer recognized the mouse and keyboard immediately and I was able to surf and type right away.  As a previous owner of a not so great Microsoft Wireless keyboard and mouse, I wasn't expecting a lot from this set.  However, I was relatively impressed and the issues I had with the previous keyboard (keys sticking and repeating) and the mouse loosing connectivity even when only inches from the wireless receiver appear to have been corrected. I've been using this keyboard now for several months and none of these issues have appeared.The keyboard design is comfortable and takes stress from the wrists if used correctly.  As for the various shortcut and function keys-I haven't needed or used them enough to give an opinion.  I mainly use my home computer for web surfing and research and don't have a need for all the shortcuts and functions.  I can say it is simple enough that my children have no problems using them.If/when this keyboard fails I would likely replace with the exact set again if available.", "I am very happy with this combination -- the wrist rest is deep enough to help and the key functions/feel are awesome.", "As usual, Microsoft makes great wirless keyboards and mice that quicjly and easily connected to my laptop. I'd never buy any other brand wireless keyboard or mouse.", "I was using an old Microsoft 6000 keyboard and I just could not use the mouse that came with it.So when I got the Desktop 5000, I was very happy to find that some of the features that I did not like on the old 6000 have been fixed.  To start, the keyboard rest is very comfortable and has a grid like pattern on it.  The overall effect is that the keyboard looks sharp.  Not to mention that the upper edges of the keyboard are in a glossy black.  The function keys are easy to reach typing normally.  The only thing that I'm having a little trouble getting used to are the extended function keys on the very top of the keyboard.  For the most part, they work fine but they do have a stiffer touch than I was expecting.The mouse works well.  The mouse is very responsive and the software installed easily.  The mouse is a bit on the bigger side.  I had gotten used to a Logitech VX Nano which is a bit smaller but great for travel.  The included mouse lets you rest your hand on the mouse for the most part.  The top is shiny for now, but I'm not sure how a very shiny mouse is going to look after 3 months of office work and constant use.The keyboard has a very nice touch to it.  The keys don't have a click to them.  But the keys also don't feel like you're typing on a laptop either.  There's some resistance to pressing down on the keys which is nice.", "The keyboard/mouse is very comfortable. It was pretty much plug n play. Only problem I had was that I have a glass desk and the mouse will not work on glass or shiny surfaces. I just had to purchase a mat which was no biggie. The mouse is comfy on your hand and is textured with a rubber finish on the sides. The keyboard is nice and quiet and feel good when you press down on the keys. The windows 7 taskbar favorites is really awesome. Quick short cuts to programs you need. I purchase this since I have a laptop and it is a bit of a strain to type for long periods on the laptop keyboard.", "Great keyboard with one major flaw.  First the good:- Soft touch keys that are not loose (see cheap dell keyboard for misery).- The wireless aspect is nice! Not a big deal but the lack of cable and reducing clutter is nice for a clean workspace!- standard placement of the arrow keys and the home,  end, insert, delete, page up, and page down keys.  I think where they put these is great.  All keyboards should have them there.The bad:- Esc and Function keys!!  Why on earth did they make them smaller than the normal sized keys?!  I frequently hit cntrl-esc to bring up the start menu in windows.  I also hit esc key a LOT during programming or just regular navigating. The esc key is not only small but recessed so it's very hard to hit accurately and with out searching.  That's really frustrating.  IF they simply made the esc key a normal size and left all other Function keys (F1, F2, ...) undersized, I wouldnt have cared.  But the esc key is used as much as the rest.- The setup.  I dont use their mouse, I use the Logitech wireless. I wish the setup was smart enough to see that I dont have a microsoft mouse attached and simply disable it in the setup.", "\"Disclaimer, received through Amazon Vine.I have used number of keyboards over the past couple of years, both at work and at home.  Some are lit, some are wireless, some wired.  My favorites include large keys, a separated number pad, and a minimum of fluff --generally full size standard configuration.  My personal preference tend to be the older ones with positive touch, and not too much squishy feel.  The closest would probably be some of the original IBM detached keyboards which were almost as if IBM was giving us a Selectric typewriter feel with deep key travel, low squishiness, and finger glideability. (Yes, I started typing on mechanical models and moved up to an IBM eventually).  Many keyboards you might purchase today come very close to these original feelings.  I have used mostly straight (not curved) keyboards in the past, so this current keyboard is a departure.First off, I am using this keyboard at work under Windows XP Pro.  No Vista or 7 here.  I almost tossed the keyboard levelers with the box, so be careful to take all the pieces out of the box. For XP use, I put batteries in the keyboard and mouse, then plugged in the USB module.  I did not install a single driver or any included software.  Windows automatically detected the new USB device and installed it without any qualms.  I have not had any connection problems at all with the USB wireless transceiver.The LED mouse is comfortable with a smooth track wheel as the third mouse button, allowing manual and automated scrolling, sidestepping, and highlighting. Actual motion is easily sped up or slowed down with the control panel settings.  I like a more precise faster mouse action, and unlike a couple of other mice I have used, this one can be sped up sufficiently to meet my needs.  The LED will track on unusual surfaces like wood, concrete, dry wall, the pant leg of my jeans- things I have tried - so it is reliable in that sense.The keyboard feel is comfortable and laid out normally.  Keys, including shift and return, are placed naturally and large enough to accommodate proper touch typing.  The right side number pad is perfect for those 9 key skilled workers, with a large and well placed enter key.  The keys, sweeping in a wave, are slightly different sizes depending on the position, with middle keys like the G, H, B, and N, being noticeably larger than the side lying keys.  This makes typing a breeze and natural even if you have used different keyboard configurations in the past.For the touch typist in me, 75+ WPM are easy to attain without a single look at the keyboard.  My hands fall naturally on the keys and the palm rest is comfortable.  While I have not tested myself on this keyboard, I think I type just slightly faster due to the curved shape of the keyboard.  Note, this is not a divided \"\"two handed\"\" keyboard, so the curve is very gradual and natural to users of straight keyboards.  The typing feel has a small amount of give that is pleasant and positive.For other Windows users, there are the normal  F1-F12 function keys, and above those, some assignable keys 1-5, along with Explorer home, email, cam, music functions, and volumes.  I have not tried any of these functions under Windows XP.This is a highly capable USB wireless keyboard and mouse combination.  If you are in the market, give it a shot and see if you like the natural and positive typing feel with the potential of increased touch typing speed.\"", "I bought this set at Costco yesterday for &lt;$40, and its really exactly what I was looking for.  I avoided wireless mouse products for years due to the slow refresh rate, but this one works very well, and on any surface.  I am currently using it on the leather couch, but was using it on the shiny wood coffee table earlier, and it doesnt jump around at all... works perfectly.  The forward and back buttons, as well as the scroll wheel, including side scroll function, is great too!  The keyboard in the set is also very nice.  Its quite thin when compared to other wireless models, and for an ergo keyboard its incredibly thin.  I also have a USB msft ergo keyboard, and its nearly 2-3 inches tall.  This is sleek and slim.  It does come with some feet that you can attach to raise the keyboard as you wish, but I am using it right out of the box.  The keys are a nice feel when typing too.  They dont click, or clak, they are soft and springy with a cushioned feel and sound.  Its almost like a muffled keyboard.  The palmrest is comfy too... not hard plastic, and it has some grip quality to it that prevents hands from slipping.  Also, the technology has improved sufficiently that one doesnt need to have a receiver base for these products to work.  There is a very tiny USB plug that fits in the mouse when not in use, and it works at least 20-30 feet (thats as far as I have tried to far).I was using a corded logitech mouse and corded msft keyboard for my media center PC, but this set just replaced that.  Wife loves it too, because there are fewer cords/wires for her to look at.  This is a great buy, especially from Costco at only ~$40.", "I bought this Microsoft keyboard / mouse combo to replace a similar set i flat wore out over a 5 year period. This unit has a better wireless connectivity than my previous unit. It simply uses a USB receiver less than the size of a flash drive. I had connectivity problems with my old one plugging the receiver cable into a kvm switch, but this one is rock stable and allows switching between two windows machines (W7 and XP) with no problems.In all this is a 5 Star product in my opinion.", "I have previously usedMicrosoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 v3 (Black), with mixed results.  The shape of the mouse for that combo was somewhat weird, although after getting used to it it turned out to be a very ergonomically satisfying experience. However, that mouse stopped working after not too long, and before that paint on the surface started to peel. So far I have not had any such problems with the Wireless Comfort 5000 mouse. The mouse is probably the most comfortable mouse that I have used so far. It is also very solidly built and it does not give off an impression that it could break down easily. Its elevated full-bodied shape fits extremely well in your hand. The mouse is also built in such a way that it can be used either by the left-handed or the right-handed users. The most amazing thing about this mouse is the range of surfaces on which it works. I have tested it on glass, bamboo-weaved placement mats, cloth and a bunch of other surfaces and each time the mouse performed flawlessly. The mouse bluetooth receiver is pretty small, but not as small as some of the most recent ones on the market. The receiver can be tucked-in to the mouse, and at that time the mouse is turned off. Since I always tend to lose the receiver when traveling, having it attached directly to the mouse is extremely useful.The keyboard itself is very functional, well designed, and esthetically pleasing to look at. It is very ergonomic and easy to use. I tend to like more &#34;clicky&#34; feel to keyboard keys when typing, but otherwise this is a very well designed keyboard.I have tried using the mouse and the keyboard with different computers without installing any of the software that comes on the included CD, and every time the computers were able to recognize them without any glitches. This was true of both Windows and Mac computers. The included software was easy to install on both Windows and Mac OS X systems, and it gives you more options to configure the mouse and the keyboard than you'll ever need.Overall, for the price this is probably one of the best wireless desktop system on the market right now. I highly recommend it.", "I got this keyboard to replace the OEM Dell wireless keyboard and mouse that came with my Dell machine. Great upgrade at a very reasonable cost. This keyboard is quiet and ergonomically well-designed. I find using it to be very comfortable, though it did take a short adjustment period because of the curved layout of the keys. The wireless mouse that comes with this keyboard works wonderfully, even on inconsistent surfaces. My wife thinks the mouse makes a slightly loud click, but I haven't noticed that to be an issue. Overall, it works fabulously.", "\"If you're a gamer, even a casual one, this keyboard and mouse set is NOT for you.The are two major issues that affect gamers:1- Function keys on the keyboard are arranged in one long line, instead of three separate groups of four. In addition to that, they are also quite small! This presents a major issue for games that use function keys for essential features. For example, most games associate the Quick Save and Quick Load functionality with the F5 and F6 (or F9) function keys. Mistaking one for the other can mean game over. And it is very easy to mistake them with this keyboard. In fact, unless you have your room lights on, and are looking directly at the keyboard, you WILL miss them. It boggles my mind as to why MS decided to arrange the keys in this counter-intuitive manner.2- The scroll wheel on the mouse is not notched. That means it scrolls smoothly without \"\"bumping\"\". MAJOR gaming issues can result from that. Weapon switching, precise scope zooming, etc, are all out of the question. While the keyboard can be used if you can manage to reassign game controls, the mouse is completely worthless. Think about it: you cannot properly play any game that requires you to switch weapons! Forget Counter Strike, forget Team Fortress 2, forget Unreal Tournament. If you decide to play those games with this mouse, quick death is guaranteed while you are scrolling through the weapon menu trying to select a specific weapon.For non-gamers, however, this is actually a pretty good product. The build quality of the keyboard is great (sturdy and heavy), while the mouse is large and very comfortable (about the same size as a Logitech G5). Keyboard keys are truly silent (but mouse clicking is quite noisy). The wrist pad is very comfortable, and doesn't irritate the skin. I like how the keyboard is curved: a natural shape for people who use all their fingers to type. There are plenty of shortcut keys as well. The included CD has IntelliType 7.0 and IntelliPoint 7.0 software for both PCs and Macs.It is a very comfortable set, but unless you are planning to never use your PC for gaming, I can't fully recommend it.The keyboard is a 4/5, while the mouse is a 2/5. So, the set as whole gets a 3/5.\"", "I've been using the Logitech Wave set and the Logitech G15 gaming keyboard for a few years now and have been very happy with them.Thus changing to this Microsoft keyboard/mouse took a bit getting use to.After using it for nearly a month this is my feedback. . .This is NOT a gaming keyboard! Mostly because the function keys are TINY and difficult to find in low-light or even with the lights on.Also the left CNTRL button is very small and hard to find without looking...a common key used in gaming with hotbars and the like.NOTE: By default the function keys are programmed for a bunch of special things. You'll have to look closly at the row of function buttons and on the far rigth you'll find the F-Lock button, which you can press to enable standard function key capabilityThis keyboard is for the average user who is better suited to having all your function keys + 10 additional keys that can be programmed to do things like open folders, documents, etc. with the touch of a button. There is also a set of keys for media (play, next track, increase volume, etc.)The software that it comes with installs easy enough and is intuitive to configure.The mouse is on the bulky side, but the extra-wide blue lasers is responsive to slight movements.The USB transmitter/receiver is nice and small.The keyboard has a good ergonomic angle to the keys.For me, the keys have a bit of a delay in springing back, so I don't feel like I can type as fast. At the same time, they are nice and quiet. So take your pick of what you like more, quiet or faster typing?I find it strange that Microsoft doesn't have more keyboards that are backlit. If that feature was offered I'd pay near $70 for this keyboard. Since it doesn't, the $50 price for this combo set is pretty average.OVERALL: The hardware works fine. It's for a specific type of user. It's also Microsoft's attempt to help market Windows 7 (which seems great so far. . .I finally let go of XP) by making a Windows 7 enhanced keyboard. If you use those features this could be a great keyboard. If you do any serious gaming, move on to something else.", "\"If you read my reviews, you'll see that I've had four keyboards in the last four years. My latest is a Logitech wired \"\"Internet keyboard\"\" which I've never really cared for but at least the letters didn't wear out in three months. It was the comfort factor that led me to ask for the Microsoft Comfort Desktop 5000.The review of the keyboard will be somewhat unfair because the 5000 was designed with Windows 7 in mind, and I won't get to 7 until my three XPs completely wear out or no longer run the necessary business software. So, I don't know what I'm missing, but I can report on most of the features for the keyboard and mouse.The keyboard is a rather \"\"standard\"\" wireless keyboard with the usual bells and whistles which have now become expectations and so are nothing special.Pros are twofold: First, I do like the touch, really unlike any typewriter, word processor, or computer keyboard I've owned and that's a lot over 50 years. That is saying something.Second, The keys, while not \"\"etched\"\" look three-dimensional although that is just an illusion created by the decals for letters and functions. There is a downside, however: the light over the desk and, at times the sun coming in, cause a glare when they hit the keys.If this was 10 years ago, I would have been raving about the volume and general music controls, but it's almost 2010. They're to be expected, as are the assignable function keys.Cons: Since I was just talking about keys, I might as well start with how small the function keys are. Second, I really dislike the lack of lights on the keyboard for CAPS and NUM Lock. The warning is on the monitor where, after so many years, is not where I look for (especially) the Caps lock.Next, I hate wrist rests, and the left corner of this keyboard is already causing some discomfort at this moment. My wife, who is a touch typist and has been for many, many years, used the keyboard for five minutes and was complaining about the lack of ergonomics - only she didn't put it quite that way. I have tried it with the keyboard \"\"risers\"\" in the back, and that made things worse. Flat seems to be best for me, tilted up for my wife, but as I type the left corner of the wrist rest is irritating. WHY hasn't MS come out with a keyboard where the rest is removable?There are five buttons that link to programs on your computer, but can you remember what they all are for?There are also a + and - key for magnification, but they do not work on Internet pages which would have been helpful even though the mouse can do the same. They do work on Word documents, but again, so does my mouse. In fact, my Logitech mouse works on Word and WordPerfect documents for zooming in and out.Mouse: Okay, let's say that you'll forgive my quirks such as never using the number keys and hating wrist rests and history of working with computers. Well, you're not going to like what I have to say about the mouse. I have 20 mice lying around. That's what mice do. And I have three mice that I work with all the time, two Logitech Performance Lasers and a Logitech Performance MX. Any one of these two just beats this MS 5000 mouse in every respect. Further, the 5000 is about the same size as the MX which I found just a tad too big for my hand. The Logitechs perform every function that I could want, and the MX even works on glass. I also like a separate button on the Logitech for zooming.This review has taken me about a half-hour to write, and my left hand is now irritated by the wrist rest to become a distraction which I forgot to mention has a cross-hatch design and that doesn't help. I may try gluing a piece of felt there tomorrow.I will give this another day or so, but I may well have to switch back to the Logitech keyboard which, although wired and with a less than desirable touch, is overall more comfortable than this MS. I gave this two stars. I suppose if you like this kind of keyboard, and are going to Windows 7, your evaluation may be three stars. But I do not find this ergonomically satisfying, and I'm satisfied that I gave it a fair shake.It says on the box, \"\"94% of users who own a Comfort Curve keyboard would recommend it to others,\"\" from a survey done in 2008. Well, count me in the remaining 6%. If you like the fact that the wrist rest is not removable as with so many other keyboards, then go for it.P.S. It took three shots to load the software. When it gets to the mouse, the loading process just plain stalls and I had to start from scratch even though the keyboard would work. And, yes, I waiting 15 minutes which I tonight was a fair amount of time to load any software.Post Script: After two days, I disconnected both keyboard and mouse and went back to the Logitech. The \"\"comfort curve with cross-hatching\"\" felt like a cheese grater this morning. Most people do not like negative reviews on Amazon, but in this case, if you've never used anything but MS keyboards, you may be satisfied, but you don't know what you're missing. I'm tempted to give this two stars... Just candid.EW\"", "\"If you use Microsoft products, it can be argued that you're a sucker for pain. There are many times that I have had the distinct feeling that Microsoft treats me and every other user as beta testers for its many products (don't get me started about Vista!)Some time back, I reviewed a Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse combination set (the Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 v3). It started and just about ended like the movie Fatal Attraction: first, great ergonomics; soft, but useable keys, etc. then a nightmare. Both the keyboard and mouse would suddenly stop working, stuttering back to life after a frustrating few seconds. And on and on it went to the extent that it is now collecting dust in a far corner of my office. An utterly useless piece of technology and the tragedy is I really needed it to work since my desktop was packed to the gills and I couldn't afford any more real estate.So it was with not a little trepidation that I decided to test the Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 bundle. One of the things I'd noticed from the 6000 was that after installing the Microsoft driver software that enabled the fancy keys to work was when the hair-tearing drops in operations started. I'm not 100% certain this was the case but why mess with fate? This time, I decided not to use the drivers on the included CD--I didn't need one-button access to a file browser for example--and lo, things worked out of the box after connecting everything up.Right after I inserted the USB device, both the mouse and keyboard started working save for a few moments while my Vista OS PC recognized the keyboard and mouse. No more wires! However, before I started celebrating, I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke so I let it go for two weeks. I'm happy to report that in that time, there's been not the one hiccup so now I can concentrate on how it works.Unlike the 6000, this is not an ergonomic keyboard but the usability is still good. The keys are slightly spongy but firm enough. Gone is the clickety-clack keyboard sounds and the mouse, while a bit bulky for me, is responsive and easy-to-use.The \"\"special\"\" keys are arranged in a row across the top of the keyboard although I don't use them that often since they require the special driver software. Even then, a few of them work without the drivers such as the browser button. The ESC key is hard to reach because the F1 key overshadows it which means that I have to lift my hand over in order to use it, along with all the other special keys along that topmost row. Not a great annoyance, but definitely a workflow interrupter. The surface of the keyboard's palm rest is composed of a comfortable almost leather-feeling material. Underneath the keyboard are feet that ensure a tight grip on the desk.In all, this is a very nice combo set and I am so pleased those annoying stuttering issues are gone that I'm going to give it a healthy 4 stars out of 5.\"", "Mostly a good keyboard.  But something about the large part under the keys where your wrists go didn't work well for me.  I returned them and bought another wired version of the comfort curve keyboard with the shorter plastic section under the space bar and it worked better for me.", "I've had trouble with Microsoft wireless keyboard and mice in the past.  In fact, I think I've reviewed some of them on Amazon as complete bombs.  But, I've had nothing but good success on this combo pack.The keyboard itself feels great to type on.  It is comfortable and has a nice feedback when you hit the keys.  The function buttons at the top have a different feel to them that takes a bit of getting used to, but after using it for nearly a month I like them a lot now.The mouse works well but it is not designed for gamers.  I actually have a gaming mouse that I use but I will use this mouse while working and not playing.  The advantage this mouse has over my gaming mouse is that it is wireless and my gaming mouse is not.", "\"I've tried a few Logitech wireless keyboards in the past and they've all been horribly disappointing.  Typing at a casual 60 wpm would cause noticeable lag and the disconnect of hitting a key and not immediately seeing it appear on the screen caused a lot of typos.The Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 has the first wireless keyboard that I've tried that's actually usable!  There's still a very tiny bit of lag, but it's small enough that I can get used to it.  At slower speeds, it pretty much feels like a regular keyboard.The keyboard feels very solidly built and has a palm rest permanently attached at the base.  The palm rest could be a bit deeper, but it works fine anyways.  It has a slightly rubbery coating on it so it's not just hard plastic.The curved layout is a bit weird because I found it difficult to reach the lower middle keys like v, b, and n.  The ESC and F keys are also very, very small and feel recessed compared to the media keys above and the number keys below.  People who use the F keys or ESC key a lot will probably find this very annoying.The mouse is pretty good.  It's symmetrical so lefties and righties can share, but the symmetrical layout isn't as ergonomic as I'm used to.  I find that my fingers don't have a place to rest on the right side and picking up the mouse causes accidental forward button clicks.  These problems will probably go away once I get used to the mouse some more.  Aside from that, the mouse is responsive and even has a clamp on the bottom side to store the USB receiver.Overall, it's a decent wireless keyboard/mouse combo, but unfortunately, my keyboard has a weird issue where certain letter combinations like y-p-e would cause equal signs (=) to appear and repeat until I hit another key.  Ironically, this prevents me from typing the word \"\"type.\"\"  EDIT 11/20/2010:  This problem seems to have been resolved magically.  Maybe the latest version of the drivers fixed it?Pros:- Solid wireless connection with very little lag.- Ergonomic keyboard for those who like it.- Good wireless mouse.Cons:- Tiny and recessed ESC and F keys.- Middle letter keys are a bit hard to reach because of the curve.- Mouse isn't especially ergonomic.- Mouse wheel isn't notched so it rotates freely.  This would probably be an issue for gamers.\"", "This is my 4th Microsoft wireless keyboard...the first was my favorite in terms of durability and function but when it wore out, the replacement (same model) didn't last 6 months. The third model was going strong until a few months ago when various keys started to stick/hang...just in time, this came up and I jumped at the opportunity to replace the former model.Right out of the box this feels like the smallest/least heavy of all four models but simultaneously it contains the most function keyes (albeit smaller). The wrist support is texturized and nicer/more ergonomic than the last model but I suspect it will also tend to gather dust easier than the super sleek glossy prior keyboard. Buttons are full sized with slight curvature for comfort. USB plug-in is very small but seems to work better than prior model(s) to pick-up signal. Immediate recognition with true plug-n-play, clear signal and no disruption.Bottom line - solid performance out of the box. Will try to update on long term performance. Comfortable keyboard with clear signal(s).", "The Microsoft Comfort Desktop 5000 is a lot like its predecessors, but with improved ergonomics, BlueTrack instead of laser or optical, and added features specific to Windows 7.  I replaced a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 V3 with the Comfort Desktop 5000.  The keyboards are very similar.  The primary buttons are basically the same, so anyone coming from the Wireless Desktop should not have to adjust too much to the curved keyboard design.  The Comfort Desktop does have a wider, softer, more comfortable wrist pad, thus living up to its name.  The keys have a nice feel to them.  They are soft and quiet, yet firm enough to assure typing accuracy.  The specialized keys are similar to the Wireless Laser Desktop, but the Comfort keyboard relocates the three multimedia keys found on the left side of the Wireless 6000 to the top row with the rest of the specialty keys.  The Comfort keyboard also does away with the translucent edging of the wireless 6000.  This results in the Comfort keyboard being slightly smaller.  The mouse and transceiver are also smaller.  Unfortunately, the Comfort keyboard also retains the small escape and function keys, not a problem if you use them occasionally, but it could be an issue if you need to type them frequently and have gotten used to them being an extension of the standard keyboard instead of feeling like separate keys. I've gotten used to the smallish function and escape keys myself.  The mouse is more rounded than previous versions and fits the hand nicely.  The buttons are very responsive and I did not find myself accidentally clicking side buttons like I did in the past. Like their predecessors, the Comfort keyboard and mouse have mappable shortcut buttons.  The buttons come with default mappings, but you can also create and assign your own macros to the buttons.  This is not difficult to do at all.  I'm still feeling my way around Windows 7, so I haven't yet tried the Windows 7 buttons.  The Comfort Desktop 5000 definitely improves upon the Wireless Laser Desktop 6000.  A very comfortable combination that I enjoy using.", "One for work, one for home.  The mouse works from across the room - watching Netflix while on my Bicycle Trainer.The operation of the mouse and keyboard are both very smooth.  This is the quality I have come to expect from Microsoft Hardware, but is even better as technology has gotten better."], "Gamma": [0.03156967833638191, 0.03156967833638191, 0.03155980631709099,
