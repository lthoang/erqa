Hands down it's the best device made to date. I don't like Apple because they limit you to there music formats. I'm not interested with I-Tunes. Especially now that Real player will let you grab any mp-3 file of You Tube for free. Just play any MP3 or Video off youtube and real player lets you download it and convert it to a MP-3. Even if it's a video it will extract the audio track. The screen is crystal clear and you'll have no problem seeing it outside. The touch screen blows away anything Apple has out, it's very responsive. I read that there will be a 64 Gig model out around the Holidays and a large assorment of App's around that time as well. I love it and have no regrests at all, and I've owned many other devices over the years. I was always a creative Zen fan but this just changed my mind. Zune HD Rocks.", "First I have to say that I am in Wow land. This Zune HD interface was designed to make discovering music fun. Swipe your finger tip up and down to scroll the text menu up and down. Select music, and tap into your favorite playlist. Tap play and start playing the playlist. Okay, easy enough but it gets very fun, read ahead see what I mean.Swipe down to the Radio. Add stations. If you hear a song you like, on the radio, add it to your cart. That's right, add a song you head on the RADIO to your cart. Hit the home button on the bottom to quickly escape the radio. Swipe down to Marketplace, select Cart, and the song you heard on the radio is in the cart. Download it and add it to your permanent collection.It get better. You can do this wirelessly because of the built in WiFi. Now, Sync your Zune HD wirelessly back to the PC to push the song you just downloaded to your PC. How awesome is that. Your Zune Pass Subscription means you can grab all the songs you want.Now, it gets even better.On your Zune HD, go to the Marketplace, and start to tap on songs. You can play them through your wireless WiFi. Okay? Songs you don't even have, you can play right off the market place via WiFi. Think about that for second. If you are home and on your WiFi network, you can listen to any of millions of songs, without downloading them!!Okay, say you find one you really like. Download it. It's all part of your Zune Pass.I have not even scratched the surface.QuickPickThat text menu on the home screen? It's one of two menus on the home screen. Swipe to the left on that text. See how there is this small strip of icons on the left side. They become in focus and the large text shrinks off to the right. Now, this little list of icons is huge. Swipe up and down and cruise through the history of the songs you have been playing. Even the radio station you set is here in this history. This strip also contains a QuickPick. So what is a QuickPick?Say you are listening to song and you love it. You just found it on Marketplace and you want to listen to it over and over again until you're tired of it. How to find it easily? Well, tap and hold the album icon while the song is playing. A prompt window will appear and offer to pin the song into QuickPicks.As you explore for music on the radio or the Marketplace, completely wireless, you can easily find those songs again via the QuickPicks or History. That's what that little strip of icons are on the left side of the home screen. Fantastic huh?More fun stuffSo I am listening to song and I see the album cover on the display. Tap that screen, and the album dims. A new dimension of menu overlays the album. It's a control surface. You see pause / play in the center. Up and Down are volume up and down. Left and Right are skip left or right. The upper top is to go back. Ignore it for second and it goes away returning the album art to view.The album / song you're playing has a small list under it. That's the songs coming up next! Tap on that little list and your in the list that this song comes from. You can now easily switch to other songs in this list.All of these menus and animated and fluid. It's actually fun to run around within this interface discovering music, adding it to quick picks and retrieving it. It's almost like a dance.Subscription music with the Zune Pass is such a great idea. And it really works with a device like this. Imagine all the ways to discover music, but keep the cost of enjoying all that music to a minimum. That's what the Zune accomplishes.There is so much more. Audible Books works with this. Though you do have to download Audible's Download Manager. I've listened to well over 200 books over the life of my Audible subscription.The Zune Marketplace software for the PC almost mirrors the features of the phone in that you can see your quick picks. You have a dashboard that shows you what's going on in your music world. And it gets this information from the device as well. As you add music, the whole ego system gets smarter and exposes you to more music you'll probably like. Absolutely fantastic.Think about it. You can add hundreds of songs a month if you like. Listen to them via radio, and download what you like. Listen live off the Marketplace from your PC or even your Zune portable. What ever you do with the Zune HD will sync back to the PC. In fact, there's more!! I know huh....So you have Zune software on your office PC too, okay...  Listen to this. Go to Settings, Account, Subscription History. Remember, do this on your office PC, not your home PC so you really understand what's about to happen. Those songs you found on the radio, added to cart, and downloaded from the Marketplace are here in this history list even though this office PC had nothing to do with that. It's connected to your account so it knows. And you can, from your work PC, now download those songs to your work PC collection. It's subscription! You can have multiple PCs all connected to your account and they each aware of a collective history of subscribed to music. You don't have to carry songs with you on a thumb drive from your home PC to your office PC. Just let the Zune software show you the history. It tells you what is in your collection on that machine and what is not so you can update your office PC with those great songs you found on the radio or in the marketplace.Hey, do you like Tina Fey's 3rd rock? I sure do. You can download those TV shows as video and watch them on the Zune HD. They have movies too. For rent in SD and HD. I'm watching 21 grams.I have all the free games microsoft added to the apps section. By the way, you can download these from WiFi direct to the device! I've been playing Texas Hold'em.With WiFi, you can use the built in browser to browse web sites. I have The Wall Street Journal, Engadget, PCWorld and several other favorites sites programmed into mine.So, absolutely the best music experience you're ever going to have, because you won't have to worry about money while you download your ears off. Get the Zune Pass and just go crazy. Play games if you like that. Watch TV shows, movies, and music videos. Add your own photos too! Listen to Audible Books. I'm listening to the new John Twelve Hawks 3rd in the-part series of the 4th realm trilogy called The Golden City. Book one is The Traveler. You're missing out if you've never heard of it. I am also listening to Dan Brown's sequel The Lost Symbol. And actually, a Gunslinger / Dark Tower Stephen King book as well. Too much good stuff all came at once and I had to.On the radio station I added, I found Black Eyed Peas - I Gotta Feeling. Oh I love this song! Also just found Cassie - Let's Get Crazy. It's amazing all that you can explore and find when you pay a flat rate and can go nuts like this. I'm in music nirvana.This is so much better than any iPod / pay as you go eco system I've had in the past. I'm giddy and had to share. I'm bobbing my head to the beat of I Gotta Feeling. The bass is great! Oh that reminds me. The music quality is absolutely here!! If you saw me listening to my Zune, you'd know I was having a good time.Okay, so enough. I have music to dance around to now.Thanks Amazon for getting this to me on opening day. LOVE IT!!!!!", "From the hardware stand point, much can be said, the device is indeed impressive.That is about all the good I can say about this device.In its present state, it does very little more than what $100 devices do. It does little, it costs much...I feel the Zune is more of a promise than a reality, a Microsoft promise!I kept mine a couple of weeks, I really wanted to like it but alas! I returned it.I passed for the moment, let's wait and see if Microsoft really surprises us this time around. Maybe in a few months I will take another look at it....", "Having owned two earlier Zune products, and an iPod, and a few others, I was expecting $300 (more than the price of a low end laptop) to bring me a few breakthroughs.  I was wrong.This product is overpriced for the $300+ (including tax) I paid.  To get the advertised features, you can plan on paying another $100, plus an optional subscription fee.Pros:--really small (but see below)--quick image renderingNegatives:--wifi and web browser offer 7-year old limited capabilities--forget about checking gmail or doing many of the apps offered by the fruit company (Apple)--small screen makes typing tough, unless your finger are the diameter of a three-year old's--no speaker, optinal microphone, case, or the like for future apps that might use them.--several websites (gmail for one) thinks the Zune is an iPhone, and asks you if you want to download an app to see your mail.  Sorry Charlie.--duh, where is the HD content for the Zune?  There's no downloading... only more $$$ to MicrosoftSummary:If you're a toy-collector, add this one to the other clever products on your shelf (i.e. the Apple Newton)If you want something more than a good music player, forget the Zune HD.", "By far the best mp out there! i owned creative in the past and they are a good mp and have good options and i will not say anything bad about them but this mp just plain old rocks. for all the people that say they cannot get it to run all you have to do is go to [...] and you find any downloads you may need and you will be down loading music onto this in 10 minutes. Know for me i have this 16 gb zune with denon ah-c710 in earphones (which are the best earphones on the market for sound) these two together are unbelievable, and all the options apps this zune is just awesome.  I have shown some of those apple lovers the zune and most of them wished they would have got the zune instead. If you buy the zune hd you will not disappointed as you can see all the 5 stars they have received, for the people that gave it less than 5 stars they dont know how to use it properly! Amazon has the lowest price to which was good.", "To me, the most important feature is sound quality. After reviewing the ipod and the zune, I picked the Zune HD 16gb. Needless to say, I upgraded the earphones to audiophile grade right away to take advantage of its superb sound quality.Sound quality - using a male to male 3.5mm cable, I linked up my Zune to my car's aux input. Boy was I blown away. The sound quality was so good that I had to turn down the bass in my car's 440-Watt sound system.FM HD - listening to an FM HD station through the zune in my car's aux input sounds way better than listening to the same radio station through my car's FM station. My town has 10 FM HD stations.Browsing - The image quality is very crisp and clear. Infact, clearer than my smart phone. Out on the bike trail, I whipped out my Zune, searched for an unsecured wireless connection and wham, I'm online live. Great to keep up with your tweets and facebook. You don't even need an APP for that, just go online and log in!Organizing audio - Once the Zune software finds all the music in your computer and syncs it into the Zune, the genre, artwork, etc is automatically displayed. You can play songs (randomly) by artist, by tracks, by genres, etc.Do I desire APPS? Not really. I wanted a portable MP3 player to play music. Everything else, my smartphone will handle.I love my Zune. Will be upgrading to the 64Gb, now that I know for a fact that it lived up to my expectations.", "I purchased it for my 10-year old girl and she absolutely loves it.  She wishes it had more games available like her brothers ipod - but she is not complaining.  I have to admit, the UI on it is outstanding.  I am now seriously considering upgrading my Zune120!Update:  Now that we have figured out how to put 3rd party apps on it, the Zune HD is getting more use.  To put it bluntly, it is a very easy device to use and the sound is great.  I compared it to the Ipod Touch (4th) we have and the sound quality (and interaction) is not as easy as the Zune HD.Update:  It is still going strong 9-months after my daughter received it.  She loves it even more now that we have more than one in the house and we are playing some of the multi-player games.  Great device - I hope it is not dead.Update:  I also purchased a 32GB which has performed wonderfully (refurbished).  I purchased it mostly to use for podcasts and a little for the apps (few - but mostly really good ones).  It is too bad Microsoft did not fully support this product line as it has been very well received here.  Most likely we will be adding another 1-2 of these in the near future.Update (Jan2012):  My 14-yr old son also purchased one of these (32GB) and our youngest now has a 16GB.  My son also has a 4th gen IPOD Touch - but he likes the HD more for playing music, podcasts, and videos.  Not to mention ZUNE syncs all media much faster than iTunes does.  In conclusion, if you want an excellent music and media player, and software to go along with it, this is the best device out there.  My only regret is Microsoft decided to kill it off.", "I was really impressed when I first got it. I think for the price it is awesome! A+ for Microsoft for doing this device!", "I love it.  I needed an MP3 player that had more capacity than my Zune 4GB.  Looked at Apple and some others but kept coming back to the Zune.  The 16GB HD is more than I will probably ever need as far as capacity but it's good to have some cushion.  The touch screen scrolls effortlessly.  I haven't viewed any videos with it yet but I'm sure I will down the line.  My major gripe is with the earphones.  Come on Microsoft, really!  The sound quality of the earphones don't do the player justice.  So for now I'm just playing it through my stereo.  My other minor gripe is with the volume control.  Can't it be on the screen rather that pushing the upper left corner of the player. This is my second Zune and I doubt I will go to any other MP3 player.", "\"Ha, with a title like that I got your attention didn't I?  This is a review of the 16GB Zune HD.  You will not see a comparison or mention of any Apple product here.  I am a 39 year old male and this review is for the Zune HD and what it is like to OWN one so that others may decide if they want one.  First off, you will notice that this review is \"\"Amazon Verified\"\" - yes, I purchased the Zune from Amazon and waited a couple of weeks to actually USE the product before submitting a review of it unlike some of the others here.  Enjoy....Packaging:The Zune comes in a nice small black box that slides open to reveal the contents which are the Zune HD, headphones, USB cable and some paperwork.  It's very stylish and nice.  Not much else to say as the box has been tucked away ever since opening.The look and feel:Ever since the first time I saw pictures on the net of the Zune HD I have wanted one.  Being a previous owner of a couple of different MP3 players the Zune was a must have just for the looks alone.  It really has nice lines and the color is just right; black and silver.  I hate this new term \"\"sexy\"\" and cringe when I hear a guy say it about an electronic device.  It does describe the Zune but I won't call it that.  The weight is very nice and it feels good in your hand.  I love the modern look and if they ever turned this device into a phone I would by one in a heartbeat!  I sometimes hold it to my ear and think, \"\"WoW what a cool phone this would be.\"\"  The Zune logo on the back and a simple \"\"ZUNE\"\" on the front - very elegant.  On top is a power on button, the left side a volume rocker and the home button on the front.  The bottom is where you plug in your headphones and next to that is where the docking connector/USB cable plugs in.  It's the kind of device that has looks that will never get old and you want to just keep staring at it.  Very pleasing to have something you want everyone to see.The screen:OLED - it's the big talk these days.  I have a few pictures on my device right now and I have to say they look great.  The blacks are true blacks because the device shuts down the pixels where there should be black so you see true blacks and vibrant colors.  Outside I agree with most folks about the glare.  I have the brightness turned all the way up and it looks nice inside but outside the glare on the glass makes it as if you want to look at the reflection then back to what's on the screen.  I don't see this as a problem as I can't imagine any other electronic device no matter what it is not having this same problem.  For me, I can still see what is on the screen and have no problem with it.  It is just the right size at 3.3 inches.UI interface:Although inside the box there was no manual you would really have to be pretty stupid if you couldn't figure out how to navigate on this device.  Also, on the Zune web page is everything you need to know about how to work this device - who needs paper these days anyway???  The transitions from screen to screen are so fluid, smooth and animated.  The touch only needs to be light and it works flawlessly.  After using the device for a few minutes you get the idea of how to navigate.  You start off with a list of items to choose from on the main menu; pictures, music, apps, ect, etc.  As you click one you dive into that section and dive even deeper as you work what ever you have chosen clicking/touching away.  At all times the home button on the front will take you back to the main menu.  The accelerator zips from landscape to portrait very fast and smooth.  I really like that and feel the tegra chip inside is working for me without strain when I see this - video especially.  Multi touch works well and tapping is fine too especially on the web browser.  Everything is laid out nicely and there is no confusion about how to find something.  This is a plus for first timers and experienced users alike.Zune software: (APPS & Marketplace)This is a free download and helps you manage the Zune contents and updates.  The software mimics some of the icons on the Zune so you quickly identify the UI and what you need to click.  Syncing is a breeze and Zune will let you customize what content you want on the device and what you want Zune to do with it.  I have all of my MP3's in my music folder on my computer and it grabbed all of them when I plugged in for the first time with no problems.  There are some complaits about the software and how it takes forever to download - not true.  There are not a lot of apps right now.  I hope this blossoms as the months go by.  I have downloaded all of them so far as they are free but would gladly pay for any others if they should come about and would be useful.  The weather app is nice and lets you add as many cities as you want and shows you not only current conditions but a five day forecast as well.  The calculator well is a calculator.  The games have been just OK - I feel they do not utilize the Tegra chip but in the future I am sure the games will utilize the chip as it would be a waste if they didn't.  There is a chess game, Texas hold em, space ship shooter, a Bejeweled like game, soduku, and some game where you try to figure out where an item is hidden after mixing up three robots.  All are fun for a short while but I wait for more advanced cool games.  Also the games have ads just before they start - we are talking about 5 seconds of a video clip.  For a free download I think they have every right to put this here.  Also, FOUR to FIVE SECONDS is what we are talking about.  Is it that much time???  Patience!!!!  The marketplace is just something you need to experience.  Music, Videos, Podcasts and more.... EVERYTHING is here for you to choose from.  There is an option for a Zune pass and for $14.99 a month you can go nuts with this and download as much media as yo want - you get to keep 10 songs a month too.  This alone is worth buying the Zune HD.  There is so much content at the market place that I can't really explain.  Imagine walking into a store that has no one in it but you and the inventory consists of basically every kind of music you can think of as well as tons of other types of media just for you alone to walk up and down the isle to choose from.  I just hope for more apps in the future and (I know) this thing just came out so while I wait for apps I will enjoy my Zune....Docking station:I went with the basic Zune HD sync doc ($49) and lucked out with it.  There is an A/V dock you can purchase too($89).  I will tell you the only difference between the two is 1) the price and 2) the A/V doc comes with the HDMI and optical cables.  So if you already have these cables, which most of us do, save $40+ dollars and get the regular sync doc.  I have a review on the doc here on Amazon (where I purchased it) so check that out.  It is nice to just plug it in and sync and charge.  Also I can hook it up to a TV if I wanted or a receiver and utilize the Zune to transfer music and video to my home entertainment center.  The doc compliments the Zune and is very stylish looking and most importantly - Functional.Battery life:The OLED must be doing what it is supposed to do - save power.  I take the train every day to work from Milford, CT to Greenwich, CT and I can go about a week without charging using the Zune about an hour or so a day.  Wonderful! The only thing I have noticed is the back gets warm when in use.  Very strange.  I have been impressed with the battery and hope it stays that way.Screen protectors:I never had one before and at the time I received my Zune there was only Ghost Armor available.  I got one screen protector and had no problem putting it on but being a noob I didn't spray my fingers and my finger print was stuck on the adhesive side.  So I took it off.  Ghost armor was very nice and sent me a replacement but instead of just the screen protector they sent the full body armor - how nice of them!  This time around I was very careful and it went on with no problems BUT....I noticed the screen protector was about an eighth of an inch too short on top.  It was enough to bother me so I took it off.  (I know you are thinking I am nuts)  So I looked and found BodyGarudz on the net.  Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz's applicator solution wasn't as good as Ghosts and Ghost's squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it's even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn't use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven't bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care!\"", "The Zune HD remains the best non-Apple touch screen media player. Here's why:-Not to big, not too small (3.3 inch). It's large enough to enjoy video and apps but remains small enough to fit easily in any pocket.-Perfects the user interface and music/video playback and browsing.-Supports most music and video formats (MP3, WMA, AAC, WMV, MP4, XVID)-Really good battery life: My real life usage is a bit less than 30 hours for WMA VBR ~320kbps! For video I can go a while, my estimate is around 7 hours at WMV 1200kbps.-Sound quality is phenomenal. Microsoft doesn't list the frequency response, but the device uses a high-quality Wolfson WM8352 sound chip.-OLED (better looking than LCD) touch screen with fine tuned responsiveness=awesome.-Offered in 16, 32, and 64 GB sizes.-It happens to have an Nvidia Tegra chipset which has 8 various processing units including a powerful ARM CPU and an Nvidia GPU. All that means this device can keep up with the latest apps and output stunning graphics (look at the PGR: Ferrari app)-Apps, I think around 50 quality apps on the Zune market place (audiosurf is pretty much my #1 app); zuneboards.com offers hundreds of both OpenZDK and XNA apps for your Zune HD. I've seen Doom and a few GameBoy Color emulators which I have tested and work on the Zune HD.-The latest firmware update makes the wifi browser extremely fast. Inside my home, I can load any modern webpage almost as fast as a full size computer. The only issue I have is no flash player support. Also, at least for me, when I click to connect to a network, I have to wait for it to try and fail, and when I retry it some how always connects immediately.-Microsoft offers the accessories you need, including the HD AV dock that supports 720p HDMI out!My major concern is with those looking to play video on this player. It plays videos great as I mentioned, but theres a problem. Certain videos, *wink*, will NOT work on this player, despite the Zune HD supporting Xvid, a very popular video format. The fact is that the Zune software will NOT recognize videos with 6-channel audio and is otherwise picky about the exact codec and shell a video is encoded with. Your best bet is to use .avi and .wmv, while any thing with .mp4 MAY work (50/50 chance) due to how differently .mp4s can be encoded.The Zune HD is a reliable and easy to use music/media player, which is why I bought it. Its capabilities make it some thing that stands out as a first class competitor, especially now that it can be purchased new for under $200.", "I like the zune but the interface is not optimal. The screen is quick to gunk up as well. I wish they would give me mechanical buttons for volume and next/previous track. I don't think I'll buy another player without it. Battery life is pretty good.", "I could recount the misery of installing the Zune software on my PC, which would have stumped the majority of PC users, forcing them to either confront the horror of tech support or return the Zune HD.  I could complain about the necessity of said Zune software for moving media to the player, which imposes terrific constraints.  I could further complain about how the software takes a long time to start up as it thrashes the hard drives, how the recommendation engine is frustrating/ineffective (at least to date), and how lots of music is not available on ZunePass.But.  Having lived with the Zune HD for a week, I never want to go back.  The device itself is in no uncertain terms an extraordinary achievement, both hardware and software.  As other reviews point out, volume control is the most noticable interface flaw, but it is (for me) far offset by the rest of the interface design and the flawless response of the touch control.  There is the inevitable comparison between the Zune HD and the iPod Touch; I cannot say that much about this, except that having dealt with my wife's iPhone and its quirks and interface, I am pretty confident that the Zune HD is a better choice for me.  The generally-agreed poorer sound quality and the unpleasantness of iTunes reinforce this evaluation.The Zune software, once working, combined with ZunePass, are the other side of the equation.  The Zune software's features and interface, combined with the seamlessness and depth of ZunePass, have moved me a quantum leap ahead in seeing what I have and exploring what's available.  For the first hour I thought of the Zune software as a nasty hurdle in front of using the Zune HD; now I would stick with the software even if I didn't have the device.This product is _not_ for everybody.  Given the software install nightmare, and various other software nightmares that you can experience (have a look at the Zune message board), you need to be pretty interested and serious about tinkering with your PC before you approach.  The necessity of the Zune software will restrict your freedom - no dragging and dropping of files here, good luck figuring out what's going on under the covers.  And if you just want to listen to music, there are cheaper ways to get there.But if it is for you, then it's _really_ for you.  I'd compare it to being a car enthusiast with a Maserati - it's expensive, it has its quirks, and it might be in the shop a bit for expert repairs, but when you're driving it that's all forgotten.", "I recently made the commitment to start working out more and I purchased the Zune HD to help me get through my cardio :)As far as Sound Quality, Build Quality, OS, Battery Life, HD Radio, this unit brings all that I wanted in a MP3 Player. I have an EVO, so I am not interested in making calls, playing games, etc. I wanted a Great MP3 player and this fits the bill. I am completely happy with it.I like the Zune Software as far as finding the songs and artists I want to listen to, it is extremely easy. Granted the Zune service is $15.00/mo, but you get 10 song credits each month.If you want to play games, do more than just listen to music and movies, this is not the device you want, you're better off with the IPOD.My only complaint is the fact that I have not found a way to port the digital copies that come with some of my blu-ray movies to the Zune.", "First, let me say that I love my Zune.  I started off with a 120 and eventually ended up with the HD 32.  Unfortunately, Microsoft has determined that it is not in their best interest to continue to build devices for the digital music market.  MS has decided to focus on a one-unit, phone/mp3 player...the Windows Phone.  Zune will still be supported on the software side of life, but the devices are a vanishing breed.  All of this information comes from a relative who is an engineer for MS.  I guess MS was just too late to the game...thanks iPod.This device is great.  It starts running at 0700, at work, and runs continuously until 1700 in the evening.  Who would have thought you could get tired of over 350 songs playing randomly?  Navigation through the device software is easy if a bit touchy at times.  HD radio is a fun feature that allows me to access new stations that are not available on my vehicle stereo.  Video is crystal clear and battery life is much better than the 120 due to the HD's solid state memory (120 has a traditional hard drive).  One thing I wish the Zune HD had, that it doesn't, is Bluetooth connectivity.  I am told that there are some Zune HDs running around that are Bluetooth capable, but they are not retail models.  That would have been a nice feature, but I guess it just wasn't in the cards.In summary, if you have not been infected by the Apple virus, I suggest you give the Zune HD (any model) a try.  It is a device that I will be using for years to come and qualifies as the best MP3 player I have ever owned.  Don't look for them in stores though.  The last one I saw for sale at a store was at Wal-Mart over a year ago.  Currently I think your options are online or military exchanges.  My local Air Force base, Hill AFB, still sells the Zune.  Online is probably your best deal.", "I've had the Zune Hd a little over a year, and I must say it's the best portable device I ever had. I was a hardcore apple fan and would only purchase ipods and etc..but I gave the Zune Hd a try and it's awesome.Music quality is something that sticks out, the sound is crystal clear even with the worse bitratesVideo playbook is flawless, no stuttering, pausing and most of all no error messages.Terrible selection of apps.Build quality is solid.Zune software is interesting, doesn't get boring easily, and easily navigated.UPDATE******1/27/2012If I had to go back though, I would have just spend the EXTRA money on the IPOD Touch, just not worth it to be using a discontinued device, yes it gets maybe 3 apps a year.Microsoft beats Apple in O/S and etc..but not in MP3 players.", "\"I've had this Zune HD for quite a while, personally like it a lot.  I have a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones, which made me throw away an old MP3 player I had, since the sound quality was simply too bad.  I tested many devices with the earphones, and Zune HD provides the best sound quality, even better than my friend's older iPod.  If your main purpose for owning an MP3 player is to play music, I don't see why you should hate this Zune HD.If you're picking something to play music, Zune HD is arguably the best.  Other than the sound quality, Zune has the best user interface.  If you use it as your car audio with aZune HD Premium Car Pack, the screen will have a nice \"\"screen saver\"\" giving you song information.  And Zune works perfectly with songs you download from everywhere, including Amazon.  The Zune software finds your download and adds it to your collection faster than Windows Media Player.  You'll need to download an extra software for audio books from Audible, but that's easy to work out.Battery life is never an issue to me, as a lot of the time I use it in my car.  I did use it to listen to an audio book on a trans-Pacific flight.  With movies and sleep time, the battery didn't cause me any problem.  Worth to mention that its battery seized to work for 30 min when I put it in an outside pocket of my coat when it was 18F outside.  As I called the product support line for help, the whole device went back up, leaving me in embarassment to explain to the customer service hat everyting is fine now, as no history was lost.Another thing I like a lot is its size.  3.3\"\" screen may be a bit small for some, but it's ideal for me.  In fact I wish there is a Windows Phone 7 out there with this size, since I personally believe portability is among the most important issue for portable electronics.  The flickering issue some reviewers mention is in my opinion over stated.  It does happen, but only when you're switching screens, never when you're reading anything.  Given its UI, this screen size is plenty for functions other than web browsing.The screen is indeed too small if you browse a regular html website, though I believe it's true for all mobile devices.  Even my friend who owns an iPad told me the zooming in and out is necessary in cases.  Web browsing is not a particular strength for a Zune HD, as its browser doesn't support too many formats, and its processor is not too powerful, though most of the time the webpage will show properly.To me the biggest disappointment is the lack of support of 802.1X, so my Zune doesn't connect to the internet at my work.  Which is not the worst thing in the world, since I don't need my Zune to access internet at work, maybe other than going in a bathroom.The apps situation is also not great.  But as I said at the beginning, this Zune is a good music player with some supplementary functions, instead of a smart phone without a phone.  If that's what you're looking for, youprobably shoul skip Zune HD and find something else.\"", "I thought this would be a better choice over the iTouch, but once I started using it I realized it's just a really slick media player. There's like NO APPS AND NO GAMES!!! In my opinion when compared to Apple's iTouch, the iTouch is a much better value and can do so much more. My Zune is going back. Also the 720p makes no difference on such a small screen and I wasn't planning on spending the $80 to use it with a large LCD.", "I bought the 16gb Zune HD because my ipod didn't have enough memory. The Zune software is much easier to use and works better than itunes. And that transfers to the Zune HD. It's small light weight and very responsive. The sound quality is excellent, and it has fast wifi connectivity. The web browsing is very fast. I highly recommend buying this item.", "\"Read this review for the extra stuff others may not have mentioned - I won't repeat the specs or what's included, I'll explain what I love about my new Zune HD and compare it to the original Zune 30gb, Zune 80gb and Zune 8gb.TV-OUTPUT Finally Fixed!=========================That's right, you no longer have to manually set TV-OUT like you did with the Zune 30/80/120gb ones.  You set this once and everytime you put your Zune in the docking station or turn on the TV/receiver the Zune HD A/V dock (NOT included) will auto-detect and automatically send the output to the TV.  This is especially awesome for me because I have a flip-out LCD in my car (Alpine).  I use the standard composite RCA cable (included only with the separate Zune HD A/V dock) which connects to one of my Aux inputs.  If I leave the Zune HD in the car or put it in the dock, it will auto-switch to the LCD screen.[Note: there is a small catch, if you used tv-output with HDMI and then switch to composite, you need to turn off the Zune in order for it to automatically go into tv-out mode, if you don't power off, you'll see it is finicky to make tv-output work at all; you'll knowattamean when you run into this.]Now I have wonderful HD radio as well as all of my music.  The screensaver is pretty slick as well.  It was the tv-output alone that made the Zune 80gb frustrating for me in my car - I had to manually turn this on every single time I got into the car.What is also nice is that it will auto-pause your music or radio whenever you turn the car off - it just knows.  The only downside is that you have to press the Play button on the remote when entering the car - but this is soooo minor.Internet/WiFi:===============1. This is absolutely great when you don't want to lug your laptop around or if you're watching sports and want to settle some silly stats argument.  Also, when you get a question like, \"\"Hey, wasn't Robert De Niro in a movie with Jodie Foster\"\" then you can enjoy your rented movie and log into IMDB with your Zune HD and find out. :)2. My friend with an I-Phone says the 'tilt' functionality on the Zune HD is far faster than the 3GS Iphone that he owns and he thinks the UI is just as slick, minus the sensitivity of the keyboard.  Lack of ability to watch You-Tube or [...] on the Zune HD is a bummer though.Music:========1. The smart DJ playlists and Channels you can subscribe to that auto-pick your songs is a dream.  My Ipod friend has no concept of subscription services like the Zune Pass in his ITunes store so when I demo'd the Marketplace and the Zune Pass he was a bit jealous.  Now of course, he showed me all of the TV shows and movies he had access to, so I hope the Zune Marketplace grows their library.What I don't like:=====================1. The clock, when your Zune HD is being charged, well, there's no real way to get to it...at all.  It is only visible when it goes to power-saving/screen-lock mode and you press the big I______I button on the front.  Sometimes you want to charge/sync your Zune (with the dock) and see the clock or skip back to the home screen and view the clock - this is easy to do on the Zune 30gb, 8gb, and 80gb that I have owned.  This is nothing a firmware update can't fix...2. I do wish the Zune Marketplace had MORE apps and MORE tv-shows like \"\"Community\"\" etc and MORE newer movies to download, but thta's only a matter of time.Everything else about the Zune, I truly love - I love having HD Radio, I love the new music Equalizer, I love the styling, the size, the UI, I truly love everything about it.  I wish I could have this in a phone, but for now, I love carrying my Zune HD everywhere I go.\"", "Just like Windows and the Xbox 360 this thing is slow, unreliable and riddled with problems.  The software is a joke, it's slow, the zune software sucks, an advertisement plays when you open apps which is the stupidest thing I have ever seen (shame on MS) and the battery life still sucks.  The sound quality, reliability, functionality cannot come close to an IPOD or IPOD touch.  The organization of files on all these zunes is also terrible.  Lastly takes forever to sync like all Zunes.....so lame.", "Very pleased with the unit.  Zune software took a bit to get used to but not too long.  Glad I purchased it.", "\"Very snappy player! Very easy to use and the free games and apps are a bonus.I really like the fact I can click on the \"\"heart\"\" button to tell the device to remove the song next sync.Easy to do:  Select \"\"don't sync [broken heart] items\"\" when you set up your Zune desktop sync.  Anything you don't want to be sync'ed to the Zune, select 1 star in windows media player, which is like a broken heart.  Select five stars in WMP if you want it to sync, which is like a solid heart.  You can easily add music to your zune and then change your mind if you don't like it while it's playing, you chooose your hear setting right on the play screen!I easily keep my zune playing my favorite music from my music collection, and by breaking some hearts I find room for new stuff.I could go on about all the other things I like, but for now I'll just say it works like no other player I've ever had.\"", "\"I picked one of these up at Walmart last night and I love the player. I am downgrading gig's from the 120gb Zune to the 16gb HD, but I certainly did not downgrade quality. The screen resolution is awesome, the internet is fantastic. I love the facebook app; all of my friends was wondering how I got my Zune icon on the page, not realizing that I was updating from my player. I think there are a few key features, such as streaming video and a few more apps, that are no doubt coming soon. In fact, they have Twitter and I did not even know that was an app for Zune. Its slowly building on. Watch out Ipod touch, what you did right Zune is going to do it right with a little extra!**Edit** July 10, 2010. Okay, I have had my Zune 16gb for a little over a week and I have noticed something. The sound that was so nice and clear on the 120gb device is not so clear on this one. I thought maybe my ears were playing tricks on me so I investigated. I found that there is an equilizer on the player! For me, this is a major con because this player now has a muddy and mucky sound that is equivalent to the ever so horrid Ipod sound. This was a major reason why the Ipod lost so many points with me. The equilizer modifies the sound to whatever genre you are listening to and in theory should sound good. But with most players with this feature, that is just never the case. Back when I purchased the Zune I had just come from returning the Ipod over the fact that the sound was abominable! The Zune, which the representative allowed me to hear before leaving the store, was what I was looking for in regards to the clear and crisp sound with no \"\"sound enhancing\"\" features. This means that the engineers tested all music with the player and decided on one fearure that works on all music without sacraficing quality. I am a little disappointed that Zune went this route with this upgrade. Otherwise, I see no cons on this player, but then again I saw no other cons on the Ipod but that equilizer is what got it returned. I will, however, invest in more expensive headphones (maybe Sennheiser) and see if that clears up the issue. Darn my ears for picking up on the distinct sound difference, for I may never have known and for that this review has gone from five stars to 3 1/2-4 stars!**Edit 2** July 24, 2010. Now that I have had the time to really get into this player (not so easy when one works all the time) I have found that the Zune Marketplace is awesome! for $14.99 a month you can download albums, listen to entire albums before you download or purchase them, and every month you get 10 free credits to use meaning you can keep 10 songs. There is no reason to not like the Marketplace. Something else that I have noticed is that the sound, while equilizers still irritate me, does not sound bad if you don't mess with the equilizer. Forget that it is there, and all of your music sounds rich and the way it was supposed to sound. There are times, I guess when I was messing with the equilizer, that the sound actually distorts after you have turned off the equilizer and at times, to get the sound back, one would have to turn the device off and then on. Other than that, this is a great player and I am sure glad that I made the purchase. Because of the Zune Marketplace I am gonna take this rating from the 4 stars I gave it before and move it back up to 5!!**Edit 3** January 29, 2011. I still have this player and would never consider changing to anything else. I have had no issues with the player and I have to say that I made a nice investment! Purchase, you will not be sorry!**Edit 4** June 5, 2012. Still going strong. I have gotten more than my money's worth out of this device. I have not had one issue out of this, it works like I just purchased it yesterday and I am more than satisfied! For the first time in a while I am not looking for a \"\"better\"\" device because I already own it!\"", "For the past 5 years or so, I've been rocking it out to a Sandisk Sansa.  Those were nice little MP3 players, that in my opinion, were superior to the iPod.  Well, the Age of the Touch Screen is here, and I wanted an upgrade.  The Zune HD seemed like the only solid choice, if I wanted to avoid loading iTunes onto my computer.  So I bought one.  So far, I think it's a neat little device that gives me *most* of what I want.  The sound quality is great, and I like having the internet in my pocket.  Microsoft did a fine job with the OS and software; I've had no problems figuring it out.  For web capability, it's a bit small, but then again, I appreciate it's size as an MP3 player.  I also really like the touch screen.  It's nice and responsive, so no problems there, either.  Now here's a list of things I'd like to see:*Micro SD Card slot*Google Apps*Netflix (It supports HD vid, so why not Netflix?!)*Some sort of email client*Non-proprietary cable for charging.So far, Microsoft has done a decent job. I'd give it a B+, and I would also feel good about recommending the device to my friends and family.", "I won't write much as this product is no longer produced. I just want to put in my 2 cents that this is a great product. It isn't just the fact that it is a great music/video player, but also the music discovery is amazing. Smart DJ, recommended picks, related artists, and the social make this an amaizing music discovering machine. If you also get Zune pass, you'll be one happy camper.If you want apps, this isn't for you, but as a music lover, this is the way to go!(By the way, it works great as a video player and web surfing device as well)", "Bought mine at Costco a few weeks ago when they began to offer an instant discount on the Zune HD. So far I like it a lot. It's stylish and super-slim, and the sound quality beats the iPod touch I had many times over. The interface is a bit off-beat and takes getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's like all the Zune-bies say, it's actually easier to use than iPod and the others, partly because they give you large areas to tap so you can't miss or mis-tap something. One drawback to the interface is you don't get to control many aspects of the music or video playback, nor do you get a lyrics page. Also, the Zune desktop software feels stupid and cannot import playlists or lyrics notes from iTunes. I continue to use iTunes (which has become serious bloatware but still has features I like) for managing my large music collection. I just make the Zune software pick up whatever new music files I upload to my PC.The app store for the Zune is tiny, but there are a few good, gorgeous games that are really fun to play, and they're all free. Just surprised that Microsoft has not developed more games for the Zune. I guess they've decided not to compete with the iOS or Android, just sit on there Windows golden egg and pray people will still buy Windows 3-5 years from now.", "\"I. Zune application (the software installed on the PC)- On the Audio side - I pointed Zune to the iTune folder holding all of my iPod collection, and Zune took it quite well; the only problem it ignores the Compilations folder, but not a biggie, I just need to do some metadata editing.- On the Video side - cannot play DivX (expected), and cannot play some higher bitrate VBR HD MP4s as well, so I cannot use it as my default Video player because of that. Even those that it plays - Nero plays them better.- Video syncing with Zune device recodes everything I have into WMV. Some of the recodings are OK, some are poor quality. I have to do more research here, I expected it would retain the input format for as long as there is enough space.- About games and applications - based on what Marketplace has - very few, but since apps were not the reason I bought it I am not upset. If apps and games are matter for you - do not buy this device or just wait till Microsoft is up to the speed with Apple.II. Zune firmware (the software installed on the device)OK overall with a few things to get improved:- Equalizer lacks a bass boost preset. Frankly, if I knew that - I would not buy Zune HD. I suspect it was done to conserve battery power, but I do not care, I love bass. Well, now when I bought it I will keep it in spite.- Existing EQ presets do not equalize as expected  - \"\"Rock\"\" decreases both bass and treble and makes sound greasy, \"\"Acoustic\"\" removes mid-range.- Internet browser is VERY basic - cannot play flash, etc. Good just for text/pictures; somewhat slow, does not look like G.- To back out of the Internet you need to press Zune's front button, a kind of awkwardIII. Zune hardware (the device and the headphones)- Headphones keep falling out of my ears (may be my ears though ;-), and they have poor bass.- I tried my Zune with 8 years old iPod Mini headphones - they do bass better (although may not be as good at high frequencies); I will be buying a Klipsch headset.- The device looks and feels great, and is easy to use- Me and my friend loaded the same movie (from the same source file, just recoded for different formats) on both iPod Touch G3 and Zune HD - Zune's video quality is much better, both colors and sharpness.- HD radio is great when it works, but most of the time reception is weak (even though I live in NJ close to NYC)- Marketplace is great even when accessed right from the device - I can search and preview a song before buying, see artist's pictures, bio, etc.All-in-all - this device has a lot of promise, but it still has to fulfill this promise. A firmware update is a must - Microsoft, please? Bass?\"", "\"I don't really have many words to describe the zune hd other than awesome. This is an excellent device and I would recommend it to anyone in the world. But unfortunately, they've dropped or are dropping zune support and pretty soon, I think they're completely dropping zune software as well. This sucks though, this is an excellent player, absolutely amazing.Very durable. The gorilla glass does have scratches, albeit I've dropped this very many times. The aluminum on the back is ridiculously strong. This product overall, build quality is amazing.Sound quality, whilst not being the best on the music (I believe the sansa clip has some of the best sound drivers), is definitely better than what apple offers. But if you are an audiophiliac, get something along the cowon line or the sansa clip.Software (both computer and zune) is very easy to work with. The zune os is very fluid and easy to use, it has a shallow learning curve (not exactly sure if i used that correctly but it is very easy to learn) and the zune software is very quick and easy. Be aware that the software does not read flac files and a bunch of assorted \"\"higher definition\"\" file types. (btw i'm getting lazy as i've written 5 review at this point [spring break = nothing better to do] so my grammer and vocabulary may be a bit finicky at this point).Can't think of anything else, the headphones provided are pretty crappy, although better than (in my opinion) the apple headphones, I still recommend buying a better pair. uhhh... there's a message on the side of the zune that says \"\"hello from seattle\"\". That's all I can really think of at this point.If you have any questions just ask away, I'll try my best to get to you. I would whole heartedly recommend this product if not for the complete dropping of support. This is a shame microsoft because honestly this is a great product. I was so excited for a zune hd \"\"2\"\" but oh well. I guess I'll try windows phone 7 and see how that goes.Thanks for reading. =)\"", "Love my Zune! Shame they stopped making them since they are superior to the iPod products out there, but with being able to put your music on your phones now dedicated MP3 players are not as needed as they were before, leave mine in my car to play music on when I'm not listening to Pandora", "The other reviews are very good, I don't have much to add.I use quite a few different MP3 players.  Among them are the 120GB GOW Zune, ipod classic, Samsung P3, Sansa Clip, ipod touch, and now the Zune HD.  The HD is very slick, clean design, solid, light, and the display is very sharp.  I am starting to like the Zune software as well.  I wish the HD had some more EQ settings, but for me, it wasn't a deal breaker, though I would be very happy if they added some in a future update.  I am very happy with the product, and of course Amazon's great price didn't hurt.Update: Have been using the player for about a week now, and it's great.The Zune software is very cool , though when ripping cd's, it may be a little behind in album art, and track titles - I have ripped about 100 cd's, and maybe 5%-10% of them didn't have the info - not a huge deal.I like the size of the player, but I wouldn't mind a larger model as well.", "The good part is that the video is excellent.  It holds and enormous amount of data.  If you put a movie on it, the movie is resized down to about half it's origional size.  It doesn't need nearly as much data for the smaller screen.Forget about using the unit for the internet.  It has trouble picking up a WiFi single even when located in a WiFi hot spot.  It doesn't have a web brouser that I have been able to detect so you are limited to Microsoft's Zune and other Microsoft content providers web sites.  The Zune is suposed to do wireless syncronization but I haven't been able to get that to work.  It is pointless anyway since the thing has to be plugged in inorder to recharge the battery every few hours.  Battery life is not very good, a few hours at best.One of the problems is that with this touch screen anything that touches the screen will change the settings.  If you put the unit in your pocket when listening to it, any object in your pocket will touch the screen and change the settings, advance to the next song in the list, run the volumn up or down, whatever.  That is a problem unless you plan to keep it sitting out on a desk or table top all of the time.One time it went on the fritz.  None of the controls would work. When I plugged it into my computer, my computer refused to recognize it.  After a few hours, over night, the battery ran down.  I then pluged it in and I got it back under control.There is this one app, the alarm clock, that had to have been written by a complete moron.  In order to set the alarm clock, you have to be plugged into your computer.  Why, who knows.  There is no good reason.  But when you are plugged in to your computer the controls for setting the alarm clock are turned off, as the Zune Computer Program has complete control of the MP3 unit when it is plugged in.  So in order to set the alarm clock to ring you have to leave your MP3 unit plugged into your computer and then tell the computer to disconnect the Zune.  After the Zune is disconnected but still plugged in, only then can you set your alarm clock to ring."], "Gamma": [0.03204570338129997, 0.012842659838497639, 0.03275012597441673, 0.01033252477645874,
