It has a really nice feel to it.  I put it on after my shower at night and it sinks right in, not greasy.  It has no scent, which is great for the morning when I'm going to work and using my own perfume.It instantly makes your face feel very, very smooth, like baby's skin.I believe in using better quality for your face and this is perfect.  I will continue using it morning and night and when I run out, I will be getting more.Great product", "This cream is a little heavy for daytime wear, but I really like its smooth glide and the silky texture it gives my skin.  A little goes a long way so it's a good buy all around.", "I have been using this product as a night cream for the past three weeks now.  My complexion has thankfully remained clear and I notice a reduction in lines on my face.  It may be a coincidence, but I have also had people remark on how young I look for my age several times in the past 2 weeks.  This is a good product.", "It's good but I wish it blended in my skin a little better. But it's a high quality product that has made my skin look better.", "This is a very nice moisturizer.  Goes on smooth and spreads well. Not a heavy scent either, which is really nice. I would recommend this. L'Oreal is a great product.", "This cream is too thick and too stinky. It smells too much like a perfume which I hate, and it goes on my skin a little to much like a mask. I read somewhere it is part of a four step regime and I only have this product so it could be I am doing the process wrong. I overall do not like the product though I will admit it moisturizes pretty well but feels heavy.", "The fragrance is a little strong and heavy, like a lot of people I would much rather have a fragrance free product but other than that I love it!Cream goes on thick and rich and leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth but not at all greasy.And this is by far my favorite out of all the skin creams that I've tried so far.", "This reminds me a bit of Avon's Vitamoist cream, which a lot of people really liked.  It is very smooth going on, and it doesn't slough off later or pile.  It just goes on as a cream and is easy to distribute and it stays on.  To me it is a bit greasy, though they say it isn't - it's a thick yellowish cream that I can feel some oil in - not a lot - it's not heavy but it definitely feels oil based to me.Make up went on over it like a CHARM - I tried both liquid and mineral based foundations and got very smooth, much improved coverage than without the cream.I think it would be great for really dry skin, but mine is just a dry in places, and I think the gel moisturizers work better on my particular skin.It does have a fragrance some may not like, and I've seen fuller jars.  The jar looks like a 2 ounce jar, they could have filled it up but didn't.", "\"This product is made by L'Oreal.  So is my old moisturizer.  I love them both.  However, this one doubles as a night cream, and it is super moist!  My skin feels moisturized until the next morning when I shower and put it on again.  For aging skin, this is a wonderful moisturizer.  What is special about it is that my dry skin feels very lubricated, yet I don't break out.  My skin feels like it is balanced, as when I was young.  I wondered when I ordered this if it would be a greasy layer on my skin.  I took a chance, knowing how well I like L'Oreal skin care products in general.  Now I am barely wrinkled at 58 years old.  I have frown lines, but that is it.  People think I am younger than I am.  I don't know if moisturizer makes that so, but I just need a little concealer and moisturizer and bronzer.  Maybe mascara, and a little bit of L'Oreal ethereal shadow. The older I get the less makeup I use. I remember seeing an older woman who had stunning skin, and she had a little bit of mascara on her upper eyelashes kind of fanning out towards the outer perimeter.  I think of her when I put on makeup.There aren't any perfumes that I detect in this moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin, and allergies.  In two weeks I have had no problems. I know people who spend a lot on skin care.  All I use are L'Oreal towelettes, an occasional Olay moisturizing scrub, and L'Oreal moisturizer. I have a dermabrasion kit that I use occasionally, and I will get a cheap facial once a year.  The cost is minimal, and one jar or bottle of moisturizer lasts me 1 year.The only other thing we need is sunblock.  I am very sun-sensitive, and I only get sun when walking to and from my car. Believe me, that sun is still significant. So, really, I believe that after thinking this through, I will use a light layer of my old, inexpensive moisturizer with SPF included, during the day, and use this \"\"Age Perfect\"\" product at night after a shower. How is that for a compromise?\"", "I just can't understand why beauty product manufacturers insist on including heavy fragrances in their products. Not only is it unhealthy for the skin but it can lead to dryness, break outs and more. The box makes a lot of promises including firmer skin within 4 weeks and it goes on smoothly but with the potent fragrance it is hard to continue to test it.  Come on L'Oreal how about making your products fragrance free?", "\"I am 51 and have somewhat thin skin from being on prednisone.  Of all the many drugstore-available creams I have tried, this is my favorite for my neck and upper chest.  It is very hydrating.  Very hydrating. Great for my neck, but a little \"\"wet\"\" on my face, actually.  I think it would be perfect if I had dry skin - I'm lucky and mine is normal, except for the prednisone thing.It does soak in nicely, and it did not cause any break outs or rashes.  Fragrance is definitely present and probably not for everyone.  There are some concerning ingredients that you should be aware of if you've got sensitive skin, so be sure to read the ingredients list L'Oreal has posted in this product listing.\"", "I am normally an Olay kind of gal.  I like Loreal brand cosmetics however so I thought it would be cool to try some facial moisturizer.I like this moisturizer but it IS greasy.  The directions state you can use it day and night but unless you have extremely dry skin, I would say use it overnight only.  It is just oily.  I have it on my fresh washed skin now for over an hour and it is still slick.  I wouldn't put makeup on over it.  I did put it on my elbows and it works great there!  It has a slightly masculine fragrance to me, sort of like a Mennen aftershave product.I like it enough to use it only at night but I can see it breaking my skin out.  I will edit this review if it does.  For now, I think I will stay with the Olay brand products I favor.Edit:  8/9/2013:  Yep.  Broke out my facial skin, especially around the T-zone area.  Good thing I have plenty of acne fighting cleansers.  I will relegate the use to my neck, d&eacute;colletage, and elbow use.", "I believe that all these products do the job.  It's a matter of using them correctly and often.  I do both.  And just tonight two 20-somethings told me that I have no wrinkles.  Well, I do, of course.  We all do.  And it was in a restaurant with good lighting.  Still, nice compliment and it's all due to my skin care.  I wash my face with a clean washcloth and apply any cream to a damp face.  In the morning, I don't wash but I rinse, again with a clean washcloth.  These washcloths get used once, dried, and then tossed into laundry bag.  This is a nice product.  Faint lemony aroma and very creamy.", "This is a very waxy cream, full of the perfect ingredients that are needed for protection during the cold winter months when heaters draw out what moisture you have left.  If you are looking for something natural, this wouldn't be a first choice since there are lots of unpronounceable ingredients.  I have tried it for two weeks now and I have to say I am impressed with how quickly it plumps up skin to hide small line, especially around the lips and eyes.  I can't wait to try it during the winter when this type of moisture is really needed and can be used underneath make up for an extra layer of protection.  It also has a pleasant fragrance and consistency.  Using it during the summer, is a very melting experience during the day though.  As a night cream, it is ok during the summer, but I think something lighter would be a better choice.  Even with my dry skin, I found that as a day cream, it was a bit too much.", "I was happy to come across this product since I don't like paying the exorbitant prices for department store cosmetics.Why I love this product:* It's effective.  I see my skin looking smoother after only a few days of use.  Since this product doesn't have sunscreen in it, I use it only at night.  I use a sunscreen during the day.* It moisturizes but it's not too heavy or greasy.  As I've gotten older, my face needs more intense moisture, but I don't like the feel of heavy creams.* It smells nice.  I mention this because I had also triedL'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce. While this other product worked well, I couldn't stand the scent.  And I'm usually not super sensitive to scents.I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to have smoother and younger looking skin without spending an arm and a leg.", "A few years ago, a long side to side study of all the popular face creams was done. Price was not an indicator of quality.  In fact, the super expensive ones (like La Prairie) did not fare as well as Olay. (Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream I believe was the winner).I do not recall how the L'Oreal products fared or whether or not they were even tested.Clearly, this is true in this case.  This cream is certainly a good addition to your daily routine.Agree-  if you've done a good job of taking care off your skin for years, avoided excessive sun exposure (wearing SPF around 45 on your face), refrained from smoking, excessive drinking and high Salt intake, you should be feeling pretty good about your skin in general today. Skin care is not a flash in the pan.  Your face shows years of your routine.Most importantly, avoid the harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA primarily) on your face.  Keep your skin hydrated and use a well balanced nourishing cream that helps you lock in moisture without adding grease or being comedogenic (causing pimples).If your facial skin care is to the contrary, this cream is NOT a substitute for derm-abrasion or plastic surgery.What this cream is:  a nicely balanced, non-greasy facial cream, suitable for both day and night use.Appreciate that it is nicely affordable as well.  (Especially on sale).", "I am dry, dry, dry.  Dry hands, mouth, eyes, skin.  It helps taking oral omega-3 pills.  But I have been looking for something external forever.  When I saw L'oreal's Age Perfect for very dry skin and anti-sagging I couldn't wait to give it a try.First off, this is a very, thick cream almost paste.  I hand to warm it up with my hands to make it softer before applying it to my face.  Because it is very perfumy.  I could not apply it anywhere near my eyes without them getting teary.  I also applied it to my neck.  I could immediately notice how soft, smooth and supple the skin on the hands were I had extra from the application.  However, because the skin on the face is far more delicate it felt heavy.  I decided to `cut' it by adding some Aloe Vera gel which made it feel a bit lighter and I know will extend the cream further.  I also found because of the heaviness it is best to use at night.  During the day the thickness takes a while to absorb which can be a pain if you are applying make-up over and short on time.  It does hydrate but since I am using it in the summer I am curious to see if it will even work better in the cold months.  I am not sure about anti-sagging elements.Overall, this cream really protects and keeps the skin soft and supple but its thickness and strong perfume scent may turn off people with sensitive skin.", "If you have dry, less firm skin due to aging, you will love the results you'll get from using L'Oreal's Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream. I worked in a cosmetic factory for over half a decade, and I found these ingredients in this cream are not only dermatologist tested, but basic and extremely safe to use even outdoors in sunlight. A lot of people are not aware that many creams contain vitamin A, which when exposed to sunlight can actually cause skin tumors or skin cancer. This L'Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream has no vitamin A, but simple basic mineral oils, shea butter, beeswax, apricot kernel oil, corn oil, carnauba wax, paraffin, royal jelly extract, rice bran oil and added calcium. All these basic waxes, butters and oils lubricate dry skin. The added calcium nourishes the skin making it firmer, more supple and resilient.Being over 50, I used this very safe cream and found in one month, my skin was noticeably less dry. I also noticed  my skin was actually a little more firm. The cream itself is beautifully soft, silky- not oily and with a light fragrance. I found that using it overnight when sleeping gave me the best results. I would never use this near my eyes, as I have always used a good eye cream for around the sensitive eye area. Oil Of Olay makes a great clear eye cream, and if you want to spend a bit more money on your eye area, Shiseido makes a wonderful, yet more expensive eye cream that does wonders for your skin. If you want to turn back the hands of time, using safe, natural oils and waxes to re-hydrate your skin and calcium to firm it up, this 4 1/2 STAR L'Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream will give you results you will notice in just one month and at a great price!", "A very good moisturizer, lush and silky but just a little heavy.Good value as only a little is needed with each application.I found it too heavy for daytime use in the Texas heat, so applied daily at night.Found it was very good at moisturizing and moderate firming seen but I did not see the dramatic effects claimed by this product.It's a very rich almost solid cream, that works well with dry skin but I found it too heavy for daytime use.", "I'm in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the start of fine lines and decided to try this, even though it's meant for older ladies!  The first thing I noticed is that it's HIGHLY fragranced, and reminds me a lot of the perfume my mom used to wear in the 80s, a lot like Opium.  It's very thick, and once on made my skin look very shiny and feel a little stifled.  I used this for 3 days and didn't notice any difference, although that amount of time is probably too short to judge.  It was just too heavy to use in the summer!I think this would be VERY good for the winter months when my skin is extra dry, so I'm saving it until then.  I will use it at night because I like to use products with SPF during the day.  The box and jar are a little misleading and you don't get much product.  I think using it conservatively, you might get 3 weeks' use out of this.  Amazon's price right now is great, but I think if I had to pay full price I would have been a little upset.P.S. I tried this with L'OrealAge Perfecting Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounceand this was a great eye cream - nice and thick!", "My skin is mature, all right.  This day/night cream is a little heavy for day wear but glides on nicely at night and leaves a soft velvety texture.  I will definitely buy this cream again."], "Gamma": [0.08243712037801743, 0.085629902780056, 0.08408646285533905, 0.08593565970659256, 0.07443969696760178, 0.08360139280557632, 0.08322019875049591,
