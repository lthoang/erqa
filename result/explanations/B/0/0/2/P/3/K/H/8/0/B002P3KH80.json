It does a great job of protecting an SLR.Pro:- Stylish design, although the advertised \"\"green\"\" turned out to be mostly black - but it looks good.- Truly excellent construction. All of the corners are reinforced, and stitching is doubled. Overall this is a very sturdy pack.- The exterior walls on all sides of the backpack are very thick and protective. I feel as if I could toss this thing off of the Yosemite falls (1500 feet), open it up, and the camera would still work. I don't recommend this! But one gets a real sense of confidence that the camera is protected.- The interior has sections that can be move about at will, including pulling all of them out to make it a regular backpack. The sections are all velcroed to the walls, and this pack can easily hold a main camera with long lens, plus several smaller lenses to each side. I like the flexibility.- There are two small flaps inside the case that hold SD size cards for the digital camera. One even has an SD logo, but the two flaps are the same size. Hopefully that second flap can also be used for SD cards!- Also on the inside is a zippered mesh which is handy for small objects.- On the bottom, there is a rather neat rain \"\"resistent\"\" flap, rather like a large shower cap - it is used the same way. It is not water proof as near as I can tell, and of course if one uses it there is no access to the contents without removing the protection.- Also on the bottom is a different flap (on the opposite side). This one is a mystery - it is sort of marked as a tripod flap, but there is no way one could fit a tripod on there.- On the outside back, there is a system that can strap on a tripod, which I think would work well.- On the left and right outsides, there is a mesh holder for water bottles, although they seem a bit small.- The main shoulder straps are well padded, and the cross-chest strap has elastic, a very nice touch.- The part of the pack that touches your back is also well padded; one cannot feel any of the carried camera items.- There is a waist belt, which is a bit thin, but has the advantage of that elastic as well. The straps can be stored in a nifty pocket when not in use.- The pack has a zippered outside compartment on the rear. Inside is room for a cell phone, some pens, and a mysterious clip over another pouch. Maybe I'm not enough of a photographer to know what this one is for. There is not a lot of room in this compartment - the pack is truly focused on protecting the camera.Cons:- Compared with the outside dimensions, the interior is small - or you could say that it is a rather large pack to only carry the camera.- There are no locations on the exterior which could be used to attach hanging items via a hooks or carabineer, which would have been nice for hanging some things upon for quick access.- The pack is the right size to carry a camera and accessories, but that makes it a bit small. For whatever reason, this pack does not carry well for someone of my height (6 feet tall). I had my short wife and 12 year old daughter try it, and it fits them great. Maybe this is a plus - they will be carrying it! But seriously, while the pack fit \"\"OK\"\", I always knew it was back there when I carried it, and it just doesn't work for my height. The straps went up too high on my shoulders, and the cross-chest strap was almost to my neck.Conclusion:The main issue I see with this pack is - how is it to be used? It is too small to take on a major hike, and too large to simply house the camera itself. I suppose that it's main use would be for more than one person, with lots of camera extras, so that one person can carry the supplies while the other carries the (very well protected) camera. The lack of external hanging fitments is just an example. Basically, this pack was made for camera carrying exclusively, not as a dual use backpack. To me this limits its' flexibility.Also, one cannot access the camera without removing the backpack, but if there are two people that also goes away.Nevertheless, I rate it five enthusiastic stars. It just does a first rate job in protecting the camera. If you have the specific need for this kind of protection for your DSLR, you can't go wrong with this pack.\"", "I am a no longer pro photographer and just do it because I enjoy taking good pictures. I have been using a caselogic slr backpack for several months now and know the good and the bad of these setups.The best thing about them is that they dont scream here is three grand woth of camera stuff like the standard bags do. This means alot these days.Ok the Lowepro is water resistant, a little moreso than the caselogic which has no flapage (is that a word, well it is now) to protect seams. It is better laid out than the caselogic that runs about the same price, but.... the case logic is more solid in that it has a tube compartment that your slr with a long lens fits into like a holster from the top of the backpack, while the Lowerpro just has the badded velcro dividers.So there is some good and bad, but it just depends on what you think you will utilize most. The very bright side is either way you go you will have quality that wont let you down. One note there is not enough room for all your stuff like the lens hoods, but you can get creative and minimalistic and get it done right.Things will fit inside your lens hoods etc.These packs are the way to go for stealth, comfort, and protection. Also think of your family when you are in another country. Unwanted attention can be problematic, and one knows that it holds three grand or more worth of gear.Good luck to you and happy snapping.", "This durable backpack / bag is so convenient, every photographer should have one.Filled with handy compartments for lenses and accessories, this product is ideal for the busy photographer who wants his or her hands free.Sturdy, weather-proofed and streamlined, this bag may become your favorite.", "\"At first I thought this bag would come too small to be useful, and that in the environments my photography brings me (including to what was recently declared by the NYTimes the world's most dangerous city - not New York itself) I would prefer to have the camera up front with me and not hanging on my back.But now that I see this bag I can see it is a mid sized back pack, not some cutsie little thing, and looks just like any other mid-sized back pack, and so perfect for concealing your very expensive photo equipment from roving eyes.I mean nothing screams \"\"ROB ME!\"\" like a pro photographer taking that huge camera bag off his SHOULDER and laying it on the ground to snap photos of the soldiers and kids. With this back pack you look like any other jerk wearing a back pack, probably full of yesterday's dirty socks and wet towel.And I suppose in a tight spot (like a Manhattan elevator) I could always sling it around front and wear it backwards on my chest like a baby bag.Open her up and you will a very well laid out and adjustable (by the miracle of Velcro) containment area, perfect for safely laying in your DSLR with lens attached and various other compartments for other lenses and things. The sides, top, bottom, front and back (and which is which anyway on a back pack?) of the back pack are all fully, sturdily and well cushioned. The compartment for the camera is right on the top for swift and easy removal, but that can be adjusted as you require.On the bottom within a velcro sealed flap is a great little raincoat for the entire back pack, with stretchable edging for a secure fit. Handy nets are tight to the sides, as well as flaps for squeezing stuff under. There is an extra back (how can I describe this) like another back pack but thin, tight, against the back of the pack for storing everything from extra SD cards to clean socks.Designed to carry a DSLR with standard zoom lens up to 70-200 mm. with room for a few other lenses and flash and personal items inside the main compartment.My only struggle was occasionally catching the protective zipper-covering flaps into the zipper, but anyone with half a brain (which I lack) can easily zip this up without catching the flaps.really, this is a great bag, the only one you will ever need. If you ever go on a trip WITHOUT the camera (how could THAT ever happen!?) just remove the separators inside the main compartment and you have a great overnight bag for a bus or plane or train or hitchhikers trip or whatever. I imagine that even with the current restrictions on air travel this could ride with you on the plane.Good bag, does what it is supposed to all around, and even more capable than you could ever imagine, with all of the well-designed storage spaces.Very light weight and yet very solid, with generous padding all around for all of your delicate electronic and photo equipment.Try one and you find you never carry any other bag, and that this one can go safely through a war zone. Or Compton.Looks like a backpack. Carries safely your valuables, your life's tools, your very expensive DSLR.Even comes with an owner's warranty manual in fifteen languages!\"", "\"Camera bags are always difficult to buy sight unseen.  The worse part is getting a feel for the size and how your stuff will fit.  I was looking for a bag that would allow me to take a few extra lenses along AND keep them and the camera safe when not in use.  I already have a nice \"\"storage\"\" bag AND a padded case for storing the camera stuff at home so I didn't want something huge.I liked this bag and it seemed like it would be really handy for protecting my camera and carrying a few lenses while kayaking and hiking, and would be easy enough to set on my lap and change lenses on the fly.I finally got a chance to use it this past weekend and it was PERFECT!!!  I especially like that it is really a small backpack and gives me room to move while wearing it, especially in the kayak.I am an impatient person so when I packed the extra lenses I did remove some unused velcroed dividers and used them to hold down the lenses since I was pretty sure I would do something stupid like leave the bag unzipped and knock a lens out.  Sure enough, one of my dogs knocked it right off the seat I had placed it on and it hit the ground.  Not a problem!!!  Both extra lenses were still safely in their little padded cells, held tight by the dividers.  I was wearing the camera so that wasn't an issue.Other things I really liked were a number of extra pockets inside the main compartment, making it easy to keep my extra cards, filters and other stuff like that and not have to search all over the entire bag for them.  Outside pockets made taking along a water bottle and a few snacks a breeze.I am totally happy with this bag and look forward to using it all Summer long!\"", "Pro Runner 200 AWThis is what I noticed right away, it has lumbar support, chest strap, adjustable shoulder straps, 2 side mesh pockets, tripod support that tucks away when not in use. Rain proof cover tucked underneath also attached.Front fully covered zippered compartment for phone, pens, notepad, raincoat, etc. 2 individual media card pockets and zippered mesh compartment inside. Strong stiff lens compartment, well padded and removable. Holds SLR and many accessories. The only bad thing I see is the rain cover is tight and will not fit over my tripod if its attached. Empty is 2.5lbs, made in China.Now for me its replacing a Promaster bag of similar price. It's a good 4 inches shorter than my old bag. Tripod attachment feature tucks away and is less hassle. Being shorter it carries two less lenses or accessories. Has one less mesh pocket but I prefer the Lowepro having the media card pockets as they no longer will slide around. This bag has 2 outside mesh pockets I didn't have before. The rain cover is a plus. I am losing the waist strap but was usually just dangling anyway. The front compartment is smaller due to the shorter profile so I have to bend my notepad to fit it in but it does fit. I also like the material inside is smooth as my old bag left little fibers on my gear.Also like to mention the shoulder straps are like backpacking bags, straps adjustable without taking the bag off.", "This bag easily swallowed my modest collection of camera gear (body and lens, external flash, spare battery and a few other odds and ends) with plenty of room left over.  The interior is composed of Velcro panels that are easily rearranged to hold gear snugly.  The main access panel unzips such that it folds open easily, which makes getting at your gear very easy.  I do wish it had a few more zippered or otherwise enclosed pockets to hold your smaller items like spare batteries, but at least for me there was enough storage.  Unlike some other bags I've seen this one is big enough to hold a jacket and your lunch, so you can take your camera somewhere interesting and spend a few hours.  It has a separate, modest sized pocket on the front that they indicate could be used for a small jacket.  A well-packed lunch (you don't want jelly leaking onto your gear) would snuggle nicely in some of the spare compartments in the main part of the bag.My main ding against the bag is that it is relatively short, so the shoulder straps come around under your armpits fairly snugly, which is not super comfortable.  Given the relatively light loads you're likely to carry with this bag it is not a deal killer.", "As an SLR case, this one does great! My Canon T1i and assorted lenses go in the bag perfectly, with plenty of extra space to add more.  I can easily cart the SLR, charger, SDHC cards, lenses, USB cables, camera guide, etc around with me.  The rain guard is a very cool idea too... stows away completely like a fold-up parka then pops out when you need it - takes literally a second or two to get your case and gear covered. Tripod holder is function for small tripods, too.  Pockets on the front, so not everything has to go in the bag... I used it for travel docs!There is a good handle on top, which ended up being important to me since the bag is really... strange, to wear with the backpack straps.  It's thick enough to protect the SLR really well, but this also makes it stand straight 'at attention' off your back. I found moving around an airplane with it on a lame task, and wearing it around other people means making awkward moves so you don't hit people with it when you turn.Good case, keeps the important stuff safe... just awkward to wear around.", "I was looking for a way to safely carry my camera equipment and work around the airline carry on rules. I usually use a standard backpack and the Pro Runner nests in my regular backpack giving me one item to carry on and still affording me extra storage in my standard pack. Well constructed and versatile. Would have been a 5 star but (small thing) you can not reconfigure the inside to allow the camera/w lens to sit at the bottom lens up. It only packs lens down, as far as I can determine.", "\"This is my second DSLR backpack, and second from Lowepro. Overall, I am very pleased by the quality and utility of this product. I have a Nikon d60, 3 lenses, and planning to buy a flash soon. Below is my review with pictures in the customer images for thisLowepro Pro Runner 200 AW DSLR Backpack (Pine Green):Looks & Style: Compact, looks very professional, yet stylish. Perfect for both pros and hobbyist photographers.Construction: Sturdy construction, well-padded from outside, thick padded inside compartments to provide the necessary shock-proofing and protection to your expensive camera and lenses.Capacity: It is very spacious from inside with capacity to adjust lens mounted DSLR, & 7 adjustable chambers separated by the thick padding. The padding can be adjusted using the Velcros, or even removed altogether to make space for longer lenses, flash, & other accessories. On the inside of the flap/cover there is a zipper pocket and 2 pockets for memory cards. The zipper pocket can be used to keep filters etc. the outer side of the cover also has a zipper pocket with space for pen, lens cleaning pen, IPod/MP3 player, cleaning kit, or a small portable tripod. Also, there are 2 side pockets to carry water/drinks and 2 straps to be used for any purpose. They are especially useful during backpacking to carry some extra stuff.All-Weather (AW) Protection: This is one of the best feature of this backpack. There is a weather-proof cover tucked neatly beneath the pack. It can be taken out from its pocket to cover the whole bag to save it from the rain or wet-weather conditions like dew, moisture etc. So, I need not to worry about the moisture going inside my lenses while going on outdoor photography trips.Tripod: This is the another fantastic feature of this backpack. On the outside of the flap/cover there is an adjustable strap with buckle and a strap to hold the tripod. also, there is a small pocket nicely tucked beneath the bag which folds out, so that you can insert the tripod leg in it. (See the image in customer images for a better understanding). This is \"\"THE\"\" feature I was looking for in the DSLR backpack. It makes it so convenient to carry the tripod around.Comfort: This bag is ergonomic in design to provide a better support while carrying. also, all the straps are adjustable.Quick-to-Use: This is one attribute, where I would have deducted 1 star from 5. But the tripod capacity and weather-proof bag were a sure ++. It takes some time to pull this bag off from your shoulder, take the camera out, and start taking pictures. I have aLowepro Fastpack 250 (Red)with a side-access to the main camera pocket.Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect DSLR backpack. You can always get the closest match though, and then buy one more to cover what the first one lacks. For example, myLowepro Fastpack 250 (Red)is good for the trips where I need to carry my laptop & DSLR while going out of town or on outdoor trips for wildlife/birds photography where quick access to camera is needed multiple times. But for a general day-trip for shooting around downtown, or landscapes, cityscapes etc,Lowepro Pro Runner 200 AW DSLR Backpack (Pine Green)is the perfect DSLR backpack.Whatever you buy, just keep clicking!\"", "I take the Lowepro Pro Runner 200 AW DSLR Backpack (Pine Green) on all my photo-shoots, deep into the back-country where hiking and light weight gear is essential!Pros:* a good sized, lightweight, backback with lumbar support and wicks away moisture control built in* retains shape, thickly padded to protect lots of precious cargo* padded shoulder straps to protect the photographer* adjustable velcro-tabbed sections for lenses, hoods, smaller cameras, dust blowers, batteries etc* sturdy zippered pockets that actually stay zipped* convenient separate  little velcro-tabbed pockets for memory cards to keep them clean and free from getting damaged.* places for light weight travel type tripods and monopods* tons of nooks and crannies for storage* built-in all weather cover for the backpack that stores neatly into the bottom of the pack/hardly noticeable* nice color combination (Pine Green) -- goes with any outfit! :)Cons: noneThe Lowepro Pro Runner 200 AW DSLR Backpack (Pine Green) makes a fantastic gift for anyone with a camera -- so, go ahead and make someone Happy!  Highly Recommended!  Katharena Eiermann, professional photographer", "This backpack is extremely comfortable, especially with the chest strap making it so that the backpack doesn't slide around. My camera fits snugly and it is easily accessible when I need it to be. Feels much lighter than the camera bag only because it is not draped over one shoulder anymore.An asset to anyone with a DSLR who takes nature photographs.", "I recently purchased the Canon T1iCanon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lenswith lenses kit and didn't have anything to put all my equipment in. I had looked around at the usual camera bags but nothing caught my eye. When I say this one I felt it was more functional for me and it was a backpack. I'm not big on those one shoulder strapped bags because they get uncomfortable and you find yourself switching shoulders every few minutes.The size of it is just about 3/4 of a regular size back pack, two compartments and a very well designed weather cover which is hidden on the bottom of the pack. This cover allows you to protect the pack from rain, dirt and weather. There is also a belt strap hidden to clip around your waist for extra security. Has a handle on top for picking it up and small straps all around it I guess for various uses. The zippered compartments have that fabric cover so it will hide your zipper pulls which is nice for traveling so no one can open them up with out you feeling it.Now for the inside...WOW, lots of room, customizable padded inserts that are pretty thick for protection and did I mention room? I have the DSLR with a lens on it and it fits in the camera section with room for the folded camera strap. I have 2 additional lenses in it and there is still more room for about 4 lenses or 3 and a flash or 4 other accessories. There are also pockets for memory cards and a zippered pocket with plastic lining for lens fluids. Again tons of room for lots of stuff.The outer zippered area is for pens, a clip for keys, and odds and ends. There are clips and straps all over the outer shell for various items, one can even hold your tripod. There are small mesh pockets for  anything you can fit in them, I'm sure bottled water is one of them. The straps for the back pack are padded as well as the back of the pack for comfort and the straps are fully adjustable. I love it, feels great and comfortable, I know my equipment is protected. My favorite part is the attached hide away weather cover.Pros:Perfect SizeCompartments lots of themSturdy qualityHidden weather coverSecurity featuresPriceLight weightCons:Couldn't really think of any other than wish it had  a detailed picture of what all the straps, clips do.", "\"I have never used another camera backpack so have no point of reference for comparison - I ordered this because it was on Vine, and I just bought my sister's old camera (Nikon F100 and 2870mm lens) because she bought a new one. I'm a very casual photographer, the type who usually forgets her camera and uses her cell phone, so this review is written from the perspective of a casual, unprofessional user.The backpack is super light, and super strong. Both are critical to me as I usually am traveling with kids, a very active dog, and other stuff to carry, like food or liquids. The backpack seems to be pretty impermeable. The outside has double stitching, reinforced corners. In addition to the spot for the camera, there are 7 well padded, configurable compartments inside the backpack to store lenses,flash, etc.  as well as little compartments for digital media. I only have that one lens, so I stashed some other stuff like cookies,nuts, and my cell in some compartments so I could carry just the backpack and stash a water bottle in one of the side mesh pockets on a short hike. Oh, and the mesh pockets have a strap that I think is meant to clip other stuff onto.I only have one lense and the main camera body to store, so the backpack was overkill for me, but it was nice because I could carry all I needed, and not have to worry about something leaking on my camera in a regular backpack, or having it get tossed around.I haven't yet used it with a tripod, but having the built-in attachment feature is great, as well as the weatherproof jacket that's tucked in the bottom. I just can't figure out how you carry the backpack with the cover on it since the handle is covered (and the handle is a nice, sturdy handle to use if you don't want to carry it as a backpack.)The back has a curve for lumbar support,which was really comfortable for me (5'6\"\") There is also a nice pocket to stash documents, maps, etc.There is also a loop that looks like a key loop that I didn't notice until I got home....that would have come in handy.For the casual user, like me, this is a decadent treat, but I imagine that for serious enthusiasts, this is an extremely useful backpack.\"", "\"This is clearly one of the most spacious mini-backpack (somewhere between 2/3 to 3/4 of a regular backpack)d designed specifically for DSLRs. I use it with a Canon DSLR andTamron AF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 LD for Canon Digital SLR Cameras, a flash and aPrecision Design 0.25X Super AF Fish Eye Lens for Film & Digital SLR Lenses by Canon.  It also has space for tripod and what is perhaps a unique feature - a protective rain-cover for the entire backpack.  Inner compartments are customizable using the 'Velcro' separators which are much sturdier than they look. The shoulder pads and straps are very comfortable and customizable. The front pocket provide ample room for sundry personal items such as wallets, cellphones, etc. Overall, the well-padded, customizable backpack is certainly a convenient and protective home for your DSLR.  The only minor complaint may arise when you are at an airport - you may now have to choose between a laptop and this backpack if you are intending to take any other carry-on. The cost may seem a bit excessive compared to other DSLR \"\"bags\"\", but the unique styling, well-padded customizable compartments and spaciousness will make it worth it.\"", "Some might argue I do not love photography enough.  I love using the DSLR and having my favorite lenses when traveling.  The images are obviously the reward, for transporting everything across the country or planet.The backpack is very comfortable.  Indeed, I will consider backpacks rom Lowepro in the future.  I carry the rebel body and two lenses, plus some miscellaneous items.  However, there is room for a bit more in there too.  The protection the pack provides seems about as good as you can get from a soft case.When the time comes to travel with the DSLR and multiple lenses, this is a solid choice.  Well done Lowepro.", "I tried many various bags, both size and style, and settled on this backpack bag. I love it! It has plenty of room for camera stuff and other items I want to carry, and it's comfortable. Very well made and with the weather cover. In it, I have a Nikon D7000 with 18-70mm lens and the 55-300mm, as well as cleaning bulbs, and soon an SB700 flash (plenty of room for it) extra batteries, etc, etc. Very well designed bag that I feel protects my gear well.", "I got the black version which is much cheaper, below $50 and I couldn't be happier. I had been searching for the good backpack that is not big and doesn't look serious, high quality to protect my gears and not breaking the bank and it's the pro runner 200. There are many good camera backpack out there but I don't need the laptop compartment which make the bag heavier and big. I just want something simple to keep my gears padded at home and carry around from one place to another.I am able to fit: Canon 60D, Sigma 50 f1.4, 85mm f1.8, 70-200F4 IS and Metz 54Mz-4i and lens hoods. I will post the picture when Amazon lets me. As someone already mentioned in his review, it doesn't have room for lens with lens hood attached so I have to leave one for all the lens hoods and flash diffuser. I am lucky that the lens hoods are in different size so I can stack them together. Other good two candidates are the Amazon basic backpack and Canon and both are under $40. However, I read many people reviews complained about the quality so I rather not get it.Pro:- Looks better in real life than in the picture.- Good built quality- Tripod mount- Weather protection coverCon- The two long dividers are a bit too long so there is not much room for DSLR body, very tight.I wished it was a bit larger for one or two more lenses because I am going to get more later. The next version is pro runner 300 which is $120. If LowePro had a ProRunner 250 then it'd be perfect. If you have set up like mine then I strongly recommend it.Update 2/19/2011I just uploaded the picture with my stuffs in it so you know how much space you can get with this bag. I want to add that this backpack is not very comfortable to wear for a long strip although it's not big. The strap design is not good, a bit far apart and it doesn't wrap your shoulder comfortably. To me, it would be perfect if it was bit longer and narrower at the top as you see in many student backpacks and it would be more room for accessories."], "Gamma": [0.3252466320991516, 0.024230360984802246, 0.32526150345802307, 0.32526150345802307], "Beta": [[0.11460812389850616, 0.062477871775627136, 0.0007002869388088584, 0.0013141066301614046, 0.00017672867397777736, 0.213567316532135, 0.0001089223733288236, 0.12471319735050201, 0.0025967415422201157, 0.0019825457129627466, 0.3312470316886902, 0.0012778214877471328, 0.0011459168745204806, 0.0011118535185232759, 0.021242182701826096, 0.0035560333635658026, 0.0005296927411109209, 0.0005235319258645177, 0.11712010949850082], [0.0987638458609581, 0.0729709342122078, 0.00041458819760009646, 0.0007417546585202217, 0.00020290978136472404, 0.22095054388046265, 0.00010135590855497867, 0.1182890385389328, 0.004099557176232338, 0.0018928699428215623, 0.31986141204833984, 0.0014403285458683968, 0.0009390258928760886, 0.0018559248419478536, 0.025650203227996826, 0.005546983331441879, 0.0007779995794408023, 0.0002284441579831764, 0.1252722442150116], [0.11460645496845245, 0.06247410923242569, 0.0007002159836702049, 0.001313930144533515, 0.00017670454690232873, 0.21357086300849915, 0.00010890622070292011, 0.12470976263284683, 0.0025964032392948866, 0.001982304500415921, 0.3312506377696991, 0.001277692150324583, 0.001145763206295669, 0.0011117473477497697, 0.021242892369627953, 0.0035559157840907574, 0.0005296154413372278, 0.0005234567215666175, 0.11712267994880676], [0.11460643261671066, 0.062474071979522705, 0.0007002154598012567, 0.0013139283983036876, 0.0001767042267601937, 0.21357090771198273, 0.0001089061115635559, 0.12470970302820206, 0.002596399514004588, 0.0019823028706014156, 0.3312506377696991, 0.0012776902876794338, 0.0011457611108198762, 0.0011117463000118732, 0.02124289982020855, 0.0035559122916311026, 0.0005296144518069923, 0.0005234559648670256, 0.11712270230054855]]}
