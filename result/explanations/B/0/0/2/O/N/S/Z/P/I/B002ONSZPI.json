I should have trusted all of the RECENT, negative reviews; they're all true. This thing is a piece of garbage right out of the box. I'm not sure why so many people gave this 5 stars - they're mostly older reviews, so maybe it used to be a better product.Basically, it's a shaky, wobbly, piece of plastic that will fall apart within minutes. I set it up to take a few test shots and it already broke. I was as careful as I could be after reading the reviews about how cheap it was. It didn't help.Oh, and they can't even get the bag right - it is also a cheap piece of trash that barely fits the tripod in it.There's also no cleaning cloth as advertised, so not only is this product pretty much a scam ($30 for something that must have cost 5 cents to make) they also use false advertising.Don't waste your money, because that is exactly what you will do if you buy this!EDIT: Fell apart while I was hiking (plastic pieces broke off). Do yourself a favor and just buy the Vista Explorer tripod. It's similar, about the same price but sturdier.", "This is not worth a wooden nickle.  It is poorly put together and came to me with a broken leg brace.  Try something else...don't waste your time and money on this flimsy piece of crap.  I returned it to Amazon and ordered a different brand with a different leg setup....", "It's not a $250 tripod, but it's a good one for the price. I now have 3 tripods, and if/when I need another, this is what I'll get as it's better than my other two. The hook in center underside can be used to anchor it in the wind, with weights, etc.", "I have no reason to buy a tripod worth hundreds of dollars. Even if I did, I can't imagine it being all that much better. This tripod is solidly built and easy to set up. I don't know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable, but I'll take it.", "If you shoot professionally for a living, you probably can afford something much more expensive than this very inexpensive tripod.  if you're an amateur or enthusiast photographer on the other hand, and you spent a bunch of money on lenses and you want to save money on a tripod, this might be just what you're looking for.  Although it certainly cannot remotely compete with high-end $600 carbon fiber tripods, for the money it's certainly a great deal, and works well.  It's relatively stable, can hold the camera in either portrait or landscape mode, and has all the usual pivots in various axes.  I'm not sure I'd trust the top release plate with a really heavy camera in a portrait orientation with a great big telephoto on the front of it (not 100% convinced that you wouldn't be putting your camera at dire risk) but aside from that limitation, it's a very good tripod - and it does handle my camera safely in portrait orientation with a medium sized telephoto without making me unduly anxious about losing my camera off the mount.  If you are working with a big telephoto, would definitely use a lens collar.Pros:1) 72 inches tall for a professional height (means you don't have to be stooping over to look at anything)2) full rotation in standard three axes3) comes with a nice (albeit cheap) case4) relatively lightweight5) reasonable stability for a lightweight tripod6) decent level detection (don't need that with my camera however)7) cheap - really cheapCons:1) quick release plate might not hold heaviest cameras in portrait orientation with big heavy lens2) probably doesn't have the greatest stability relative to an hi-end professional tripod3) rotation in vertical axis is perhaps a little bit stiff and not as smooth as more expensive tripods", "Arrived earlier than expected and before the due date. Very professional looking and even has foam rubber on grip(handle). Placed Canon t3i on and started taking pictures. The tripod is very stable, easy to setup and the adjusters on the legs work fine. In the picture they look kind of bulky. I like the idea of 2 levels on the head. The hand crank is smooth not jerky as with other tripods I used in the past. If you are taking pictures and it is a little breezy, hang the bag off the hook and weight it whith something like a large rock. Very good price. I would recommend it to anyone.", "This is a rickety, cheaply-made tripod. I have my doubts on how long it will last before one of the molded plastic parts gives out. I realize that $32 isn't a whole lot to pay for a tripod, but this is barely worth that much in my opinion. If you were attracted to this particular tripod because of the advertised 72-inch height, my advice is to reconsider. For people of average height (let's say, 5'4&#34; to 5'10&#34;), the 72-inch height is actually uncomfortably high (I'm 5'9&#34; tall). The 60-inch height of most cheap tripods is actually more practical for getting the camera to eye level, shooting kids, etc. So I would choose one of the cheaper 60-inch tripods, which are available in the range of $20, which is closer to what tripods of this quality are worth. The person who decided to add the word Pro to the description of this tripod should find a new line of work, possibly as a government speech-writer.", "This tripod is not well constructed.  I would steer clear of this and spend a little more money if I had it to do over again.  The bottom line is, it gets the job done, but not well.  It is flimsy, and doesn't stay steady even in light wind (so really, what's the point of the tripod then?).  It can get to 72&#34; only by having a telescopic head, which doesn't screw in place tight enough and drifts badly.  The materials seem cheap and the plastic bits are about the quality you'd expect in an off-brand child's toy, maybe worse.In the end, this is a pretty bad product.  I would send it back, but it would probably cost about as much in postage as its worth, so I'm stuck with it for now.  I do not recommend this product.", "This is the second tripod that I tried. The first one I purchased fell apart on first use.  It was one that I had purchased for Christmas, when it didn't last the day, I returned it.  I was skeptical buying another tripod for a cheap amount again, but figured why not?  So I purchased this one, and have been very happy with it since.", "It seems like a keep finding you are and you were features that I didn't realize this tripod had I'm absolutely in love with this tripod it's dirty and it has anything that anyone could ever want and tripod I don't see a reason why purchasing a diferent one", "\"Very well constructed, sturdy tripod for the price! Tested this with Canon Rebel t1i with the kit lens, and it was very sturdy. Easy to open and set up, and the carrying case is sturdy too. Free cleaning kit was included, which was added plus. Only gripe is the parts seem a bit cheaply made as it's all plastic. BUT, this light weight and the ability to expand to 72\"\" is very nice on trip!\"", "This inexpensive tripod is perfect to leave in the back of the car if you're absent minded and you forget to bring your pro tripod to a gig.  I wouldnt put anything bigger than a nikon or canon (or any) DSLR on it, but it works quite well and isn't too wobbly, especially if you hang a sand bag on the center hook which helps to keep it nice and steady.  It has saved me a couple of times when I forgot to toss my Manfrotto into the car when heading out to a video gig,", "I bought this tripod with my new Nikon camera, the pro is that it can fit almost all the models camera, easy to set up and carry. The cons is that the material is not strength enough but is it fair with that price and for the beginner who do not need a really professional tripod first.", "Fairly solid but when using the telescoping you've got to have a hand ready to tighten the adjustment or the Vanessa with immediately stop. The  telescopic extension is also wobbly. Not sturdy if the floor easily shakes or in wind.", "Even without an istruction sheet I was able to take it out of the carrying case and set it up quickly. It has a quick detach type head which you detach from the tripod and screw on the camera, then lock back on the tripod. This is easier than trying to hold the tropod still while trying to turn the camea to screw it onto the tripod. This is great for when you need to relocate the tripod. You can easilty remove the camera with the head, set it in a safe place, then relocate you tripod without trying to balance the weiight of the camera while extending the tripod legs etc.", "Tripod was pretty good considering it didn't cost that much. Everything functioned as intended. After a few days using it, the bottom cape of the tripod (the center leg) came off. Was cheaply glued. I had to drill a hole and ran a screw with a caps nut to prevent the tripod from collapsing."], "Gamma": [0.030873578041791916, 0.030895257368683815, 0.030873578041791916, 0.030872872099280357,
