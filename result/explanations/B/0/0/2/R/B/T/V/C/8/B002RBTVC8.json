The white chocolate melts in the mouth and bursts with vanilla flavor instead of being waxy and tasting like vanilla candles.  These truffles are really too easy to eat, so I can only imagine the havoc a whole box of 60 could do.", "This was a wonderful surprise in a small perfect sized package! Lindt Lindor Truffles White Chocolate, 60-Count Box. What is great about this is the taste is simply excellent without being too rich... yet somehow you can eat just one or perhaps two taking your time to savor the enormous yet light flavor. Trying to decide how I want to use these in a baking recipe too.. they are that good. Enjoy!", "Whew! These things... man, these things are delicious.If you like white chocolate, buy these. At the price (a quarter a pop) they're well worth it.The white chocolate shell on these is soft, sort of flexible. Inside is a white chocolate filling that is DELICIOUS. Several guests have tried these, and it's fun watching their eyes go wide when the flavor hits. These make for a decadent treat and look really classy left in a bowl for guests. Of all the individually wrapped bonbons or truffles I've had, I think these are my favorite. The white chocolate really is just so luxurious and delicious.FIVE STARS!", "I have enjoyed these sweet white chocolate truffles many times in Lindt assortment packs. I don't like them as well in this single variety pack. These are mild and sweet with the usual melt in your mouth eating experience and consistency but not something I want in this large a quantity. I still think they are very nice as part of an assortment pack though.", "If you love white chocolate as much as I do, then &#8220;Lindt Chocolate Lindor Truffles, White Chocolate&#8221; are a treat you will enjoy.  In order to provide an accurate description of this candy&#8217;s characteristics, I conducted my own taste test of several white chocolates.  It was a sacrifice, but a necessary one &#8230;The center of each Lindt Truffle has a creamy texture and a light, buttery flavor; it is heavenly.  It compares very favorably with a similar white chocolate truffle filling found in a similar Godiva candy.The shell of the &#8220;Lindt Chocolate Lindor Truffles, White Chocolate&#8221; was not as creamy or delicate as the shell of the Godiva candy; the Lindt shell was also slightly waxy and a bit gritty.  In comparing other white chocolates, Ghiradelli Classic White Baking Chips were both grittier and waxier than the Lindt white chocolate shell.  In contrast, Guittard Choc-Au-Lait Chips had the creamiest texture and best flavor of the white chocolates sampled.  The negatives associated with the Lindt Truffles were not so pronounced as to detract from the overall quality and my enjoyment of this candy.Lovers of white chocolate will find &#8220;Lindt Chocolate Lindor Truffles, White Chocolate&#8221; are a heavenly treat.  I will definitely be purchasing more.", "I'm a big fan of Lindt, but by the time these got to me, they were a melted, liquid mess. It had gotten all over the mailing envelope and was even on my front porch! Too bad.", "Lindt white chocolate truffles are those kind of candies that are hard to resist.  Smooth white chocolate with a creamy filling.  Well worth having on had for those special occasions or just to satisfy a chocolate craving.", "I was very sad that most of my truffles were smashed and melted. I would not hesitate to order these in the winter but even a late spring shipment didn't get them here in one piece.The truffles themselves are heavenly. They are a mouthful of perfectly silky white chocolate with an every more fabulous filling. They are very rich and decadent. I have quite a sweet tooth but I couldn't eat more than two. They are very indulgent and satisfying.", "I would love to be able to review this item, but couldn't taste any of it since it came completely melted.  Inside of the bag was just a complete, melted bunch of goo.  Couldn't even muster a little taste. Very messy. You would thing that Vine would ship these items more carefully. doesn't do much good if you can't sample it.", "White chocolate shell on the outside and a rich, creamy, almost liquid filling on the inside, all in typical excellent Lindt quality. Regardless of how one prefers it - suck it and let the shell slowly melt away to finally enjoy the richness of the filling, or bite through the shell to get to the silky core immediately, it is a perfect piece of chocolate to enjoy for lovers of white chocolate. Just keep them cool enough to where they don't melt away before they are in your mouth!Warning: These are highly addictive and I almost always end up having that one piece too many because these are so delicious that it is hard to stop.", "Lindt has always been known to make gourmet chocolates and the Lindt Lindor Truffles White Chocolate is no different. It is deliciously satisfying, calming your chocolate cravings. It is kind of on the expensive side for a box of 60 small pieces but you would expect this in any kind of gourmet swiss chocolate just like a Toblerone. As with most chocolates, moderation is the key to eating it, though is very hard to resist the Lindt Lindor Truffles White Chocolate!", "Lindt is known for their high quality chocolate, and this is no exception.  It's a solid white chocolate ball with a liquid white chocolate center.  The center is a hint more sweet, and the ball is a bit more bitter, so the two work together in counterpoint to really give you the full white chocolate experience.Just be aware, first, that the center is liquid, and might spill on the unwary, and second, that these are hard to resist.", "I absolutely LOVE Lindt white chocolates truffles!  The are absolutely sinful--a true religious experience. IF every you need a complete &#34;comfort&#34; sensation, just pop one in your mouth and let it melt. The warmth that flows through you will be so relaxing and comforting!I keep these in the refrigerator and grab one or two for a mid morning or afternoon  regrouping experiencing!  The stress just melts away!", "I have had better white chocolate, but the creamy white chocolate interior takes this truffle over the top and I would certainly purchase this again.  It is rich and creamy, and not something that you can over-indulge in.  Our family likes to have one after dinner for that sweet ending.", "I think chocolate truffles are the best treat on earth. And Lindor truffles are among the best.So I figured I would try the white chocolate variety.These are very rich and tasty.The very rich part means that one or two of these truffles are enough to my craving for sweets.This is good, because I don't think they fit anyone's definition of health food.", "Smooth, creamy, a little round ball of chocolate perfectly sized for satisfying cravings.  They are very attractive, so they also make nice gifts, stocking stuffers, easter basket stuffers, etc.  Even just handing one individually wrapped ball to someone will get a smile and a thanks.The downside is the very high fat content. A serving of 3 balls (which is very easy to consume) has 19 grams of fat (29% daily value), 14 of which are saturated (70% daily value). This is an even higher saturated fat content than the milk chocolate balls.  The ingredients are white chocolate, vanillin (artificial flavoring), vegetable oil (coconut, palm kernel), sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, skim milk, soya lecithin and artificial flavors.Also, they melt easily, so you have to be careful about storage (the package recommends 60-68 degrees F).When I eat too many, I do notice an oily texture, perhaps due to the vegetable oil as the third ingredients. I can't say I love this aspect of the chocolate.  However, overall, these are an attractively presented and delicious indulgence on occasion.", "Update to my original review: I liked these so much that I bought a small bag of them recently--except I boughtGodiva Chocolatier Assorted Classic Truffles Milk Dark White 4.25ozinstead.  And I was surprised to discover that I really didn't enjoy the Godiva truffles.  They just didn't have as much flavor.  So the next time I boughtLindt Lindor Four Flavors Assorted Chocolate Truffles 19 ounceinstead and think I'll have a bag of these in the fridge from now on.-----------------------These are surprisingly refreshing white chocolates.  Typically white chocolate tastes about the same as butter--creamy, sweet, and not much else--but these have more flavor to them.Unlike other Lindt truffle chocolates I've tried, these also don't have that structure of a 'chocolatey' shell which once broken away reveals a slightly chalky core--at least that's how they seem when I buy them at a convenience store here in New York City.  The white chocolates have a consistent smoothness throughout.I kept them in the fridge and treated myself to one or two a day.Bottom Line: The perfect little sweet treat, just the right size, not overly creamy or sweet.  I'm definitely planning on buying more of these in the future.", "I'm not much of a chocolate eater in all honesty, but I gotta admit these babies rock... They're made of a fine white chocolate on the outside, and all soft and delicious on the inside.  I really couldn't believe how scrumptious they were in comparison to all the other chocolate delicacies that people are always asking me to try. In fact I would go as far to say that I am glad I don't have them hanging around all the time.  I would be twice as big as I am. Just truly delectable.  In my opinion these these things are perfect if you are in the mood to really spoil yourself, or would make a fine gift for the true chocolate lover in your life.  Highly recommended... : )", "These days, it's all about the calories for me.3 of these balls are 230 calories.That's 77 calories per ball.  Not bad.  Nice little boost, to pack one or two of these in your back pack, or keep in your office drawer, without needing a full candy bar.The taste for me is wonderful, because I really like white chocolate, and the smooth but firm creaminess of the inside is something to really savor.  But if you're a chain eater, or impulsive eater...don't keep too many close at hand.Overall wonderful product, but there is a calorie cost/benefit ratio to consider.", "These are really good. So many times, white chocolate tastes waxy to me, but that was not the case with these. The white chocolate was mild and sweet. The inside is like velvet. What I like most is one is enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, for a little under 80 calories, and it is a large bite. I feel pampered to indulge in these chocolates.", "If Zeus ate chocolate truffles on Mount Olympus, I think it would be Lindor White Chocolate Truffles. I'm normally not a big fan of white chocolate, but these truffles are amazing. Rich & creamy, they melt in your mouth and make you want another as soon as you've finished the first one. These have become my &#34;Mom needs a mental break!&#34; snack and I hide them from the rest of the family. So incredibly good!", "I really liked these candies too much! They are really rich tasting but I could still eat several before I felt like it was overkill on the sweetness.The white chocolate was really smooth and creamy and along with the center, tastes like heaven.These came well packed and none of them were melted or odd looking as some other reviewers said. I would eat these again but I think I might have to stick with just getting one or two when I go through the checkout line at the grocery store because they are hard to stay out of for me.I highly recommend and I also think these would be a nice gift if you know someone who likes white chocolate.", "I love the milky taste of white chocolate, and I love these truffles from Lindt.  They are smooth and creamy, and melt in your mouth like the best fine chocolate should. Each truffle is individually wrapped.  They are the perfect serving size to pop in my mouth; the only trouble is that it's hard to stop at one.  I personally think Lindt makes the best white chocolate around.Mine arrive in hot weather and were very soft, so I was forced to put them in the fridge to re-set. This unfortunately hard set the liquid interior, but hey, I discovered that I liked the new 'solid chocolate' white truffle just as much. I'll definitely be purchasing these again, although at my local store instead of having them shipped. 5-stars for the chocolate itself.", "These Lindt truffles are a hard shell of white chocolate with a smooth white chocolate filling.  They have a pleasant texture and a rich taste.  If you're a white chocolate fan, you will enjoy them.I can't say these are my favorite Lindt truffles over all (that would be the caramel), but they are delicious and very affordable compared to many other chocolate brands of the same quality.  Plus, they are much better than Hershey's.", "I'm a big fan of Lindt Lindor Chocolate Truffles.  These white chocolate ones are good, no question.  But they're a tad sweet for my tastes.Very creamy and smooth, the usual Lindt quality shows.  They're a nice change from the usual milk or dark chocolate truffles -- I like them, but I didn't *love* them.  Taste is a very individual thing, though, so if you like really creamy sweet truffles, these might work really well for you.", "Oh my. These should be prescription only, because they are the best anti-depressant money can buy.White chocolate always makes me happy. PMS? Bad day? Doesn't matter, a few pieces of white chocolate and I can go back to pretending to be a nice person, no problem. There should be clinical trials on this stuff.It's smoooooooth. You pop it in your mouth and it starts melting, spreading it's sweet, creamy goodness all over your tongue. You roll it around a little to make the goodness spread more evenly, and your mouth is filled with sweet, melted creaminess.Try not to moan, the best is yet to come.Finally, you get to the soft, liquidy center, it spreads through your mouth, over your taste buds, and glides smoothly down your throat. Now you can moan.Even when it's gone, it's not really gone. A feeling of happiness and well being pervades you. You feel lighter, almost bulletproof. Bring it on, kids and hubby. You can't harsh my mellow. I have the power of white chocolate, and I'm not afraid to use it.It's like a healing potion and suit of white chocolate armor all rolled into one amazing little ball.I am not exaggerating. I seriously feel this way about white chocolate, it really has this effect on me, and this particular brand is the best I've tried. I'm sure that someday medical studies will back me up on this.", "Like all of the other Lindt chocolate truffles I've had (to date), the White Chocolate truffles are excellent. The hard(er) white chocolate shell surrounding the smooth, creamy, soft center is exceptionally hard to resist. Once you've started to eat them, it's hard to stop yourself from getting another, and another, and then another, and so on (my oldest daughter seems to agree...I found her sneaking them out of the kitchen more than once).The Lindt white chocolate truffles are excellent and arrived unmelted. I'm not sure I'd trust shipping them into a state like South Carolina in the middle of August (when temperatures can get to the triple digits and humidity can be high enough to wilt a corrugated box), but these looks like they'll stand up to shipping to more moderate climes nicely.", "I tried another kind too, the dark chocolate truffle, but these are my faves. The taste is so smooth and buttery. I tried eating the outer covering and inside cream separately, but found that it is the combination, melted in my mouth, that really gives satisfaction. If you want to be baaaad, go all the way. T'heck with the ingredients, which are white chocolate [sugar, cocoa butter, milk, skim milk, soya lecithin (emulsifier), vanillin (artificial flavoring)], vegetable oil (coconut, palm kernel), sugar, cocoa butter, milk, skim milk, soya lecithin (emulsifier), artificial flavors. Does say &#34;May contain traces of peanuts/tree nuts.&#34;Advise finding some method of portion control cuz are addictive.", "A solid white chocolate that comes in at 230 calories for a serving of 3 balls.  Although the chocolate is good, I found it a little boring as compared to others in the Lindt line; I enjoyed it much more when I ate this chocolate with some fresh raspberries.", "These Lindt White Chocolate truffles were simply delicious.  Eat bite was full of creamy, almost sinful goodness.The package contains a generous amount of candies - too many to eat in one sitting!  Instead, you'll want to savor them one delicious morsel at a time.We aren't huge chocolate eaters in our house, so we've been snacking on these little by little, but they've kept well and seem to be the perfect end to a hectic day at work or school.", "These white chocolate truffles are  are s o delicious. I don't usually like white chocolate but these changed my mind. They are addictive can't just eat one'They are well worth the money.", "I adore Lindt Truffles! They are so creamy and rich. This white flavor is not my favorite, but they are still on par with the quality of the truffles themselves.  If you love white chocolate, I think you'll like these.  I only like it in limited amounts, it's a bit rich for me, I prefer dark chocolate.  But if I just eat one truffle (which is hard to do sometimes!) then it's not too much for me."], "Gamma": [0.033727534115314484, 0.03050229884684086, 0.03143000975251198, 0.031067615374922752,
