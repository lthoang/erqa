Both this Belkin Cinema Dot Folio and my older Targus VuScape are folio covers that also function as iPad stands to prop up the screen at different viewing angles.As with most iPad folio cases, this is only designed for landscape-mode (horizontal) viewing and not for portrait-mode (upright) viewing.  The iPad is held within four rubber bumper corner clasps and it cannot be rotated to an upright position.  There are currently a few folio cases that can prop up an iPad that has been rotated to view in portrait mode.The Belkin Cinema Strip Folio Case's notable product features are described and rated below:&#9658; Packaging, Style & Appearance: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies ratingThis folio cover comes in three tastefully-subdued color options of black, purple, and grey.  If you prefer a snazzier or more perky color, then perhaps these three colors may not be enough for you.  However, even though I love vibrant colorful clothing and art, basic black or solid colors suit me just fine for iPad/phone/computer/camera/luggage cases, covers, or bags.  Compared to the totally solid black smooth exterior color of my Targus VuScape, this Belkin folio cover has a soft texture like suede velour.  The dotted pattern and extra texture that the dots create are great for gripping the case more securely with my hands, and the dots add a great deal of style to the exterior, but this dotted texture also picks up lint and dust very easily.&#9658; Construction & Build Quality: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies ratingAll seams and stitching are of high quality throughout.  This is also true of my Targus VuScape.&#9658; Design & Features: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Not-so-good 3-fuzzies ratingBoth this Belkin Cinema Dot Folio and the Targus VuScape are designed in a similar way with how they pivot the iPad upright at various angles when using the folio cover in \"\"stand mode\"\".  On both models, their back cover has a hinged bend in the back panel that serves as the pivot point when I place the iPad upright in \"\"stand mode\"\".  This Belkin folio cover is nicer than the Targus VuScape when swiveling the iPad upright to its \"\"stand mode\"\" because all four corners of the iPad can remain secured inside the folio cover's four rubber bumper corner clasps, whereas on the Targus model, I have to pop the bottom two corners of the iPad out of the Targus cover's bottom two corner clasps.  But popping the iPad out of its bottom two corner clasps is easy to do on the Targus VuScape because the corner clasps grip onto the iPad corners less firmly than on this Belkin model.Both the back cover panel and front cover panel on this Belkin folio cover are far less stiff and rigid than the Targus, and this lack of rigid sturdiness in this Belkin folio cover makes it more floppy, wiggly, and wobbly if I have placed it on anything other than the flat surface of a table or desk (e.g. my lap or a pillow or cushion).When used on a flat surface like a table or desk, this Belkin folio cover allows me to position the iPad at a far more flexible variety of viewing angles than my Targus VuScape.  When using the Targus VuScape in \"\"stand mode\"\", the long edge of the iPad can be positioned to rest inside two different grooves for either a nearly vertical position or a (roughly) 60 degree angle.  The Targus VuScape has to rely on these two grooves for holding the edge of the iPad because the slippery edge of the iPad is what comes into contact with the surface of the folio cover when used in \"\"stand mode\"\".On this Belkin folio cover, there are many more grooves molded all along the surface of the folio cover for more flexible angling of the iPad.  And because this Belkin folio's back cover panel clasps the bottom of the iPad and raises it slightly above the surface of the front cover (when used in \"\"stand mode\"\") so that the bottom edge of the rear cover panel is pressing onto the grooved area on the front cover's surface, I can easily fine-tune the viewing angle on this Belkin folio cover.  However, this \"\"stand mode\"\" angled-viewing only works well when this folio cover is placed on a sturdy level surface like a table or desk.  As mentioned, because the front cover's surface on which the iPad is positioned at an angle is so thin and flexible, if I place this folio cover in \"\"stand mode\"\" on my lap, if I shift my legs around some or shift my weight because I reached over to a table to grab a cup of water, the iPad often also shifts, slides around, and loses its viewing angle because it is dependent on a constant friction being maintained along the entire bottom edge of the iPad as it presses onto the inside of the front cover, and it loses this friction-hold if the base of the front cover shifts around and flexes while I have it placed on my lap.  This does not happen on my Targus VuScape due to its very rigid, and very well-padded, front cover panel.  As a definitive proof of how much more rigid the Targus VuScape is when used in \"\"stand mode\"\" compared to this Belkin model, if I use both of these folio covers to prop the iPad upright at an approximate 60-degree viewing angle, I can use just the thumbs and index fingers of both hands to grab just the very front corners of the Targus' front cover (the two corners at the front of the \"\"base\"\" that the iPad is resting on) and I can carry the iPad in the Targus folio cover propped upright like this across the room if I want to show someone my iPad, and the horizontally-positioned front cover can support the entire weight of the iPad that is placed upon it.  I am not able to perform this same maneuver using this Belkin folio cover because the front cover that is used as the base on which the iPad rests is too flimsy and flexible that it cannot support the weight of the iPad.  So using this Belkin model, if I want to walk across the room to show someone my iPad, I have to place one hand underneath the front cover base to support it as I carry it.To further exacerbate the problem with the front cover panel being too flexible and wobbly, the front cover panel has a deeper groove that is positioned to allow the iPad to be propped up in a nearly upright position, and this groove also serves as a hinge where the front cover can be bent.  The Targus VuScape's front cover is very stiff and rigid, and it does not have this hinged area.  The front cover panel is already very thin and easily flexes, and molding this deep groove into the front cover panel creates an even more wobbly and unstable platform when placing it on a non-level surface like my lap.  And when the front cover panel is placed onto the iPad's screen to carry or transport the closed folio cover, the front cover very easily buckles and shifts around even though a magnetic flap weakly clasps onto its edge.  A deeper groove is molded along the inside of the front cover.  Because this deeper groove was molded into the front cover panel in this way to create an easily-bent hinge area on the front cover, the front cover easily buckles and raises up off the iPad's screen along this grooved area of the front cover, and this can create problems with this cover's Auto-Wake magnets prematurely waking up the iPad from its sleep mode if the iPad's Auto-Wake option is turned on.Both this Belkin Cinema Dot Folio and the Targus VuScape are designed so that the audio speaker area, camera lens, and ports always remain unobstructed by the cover.&#9658; Protection From Bumps, Drops, and Impacts: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Not-so-good 3-fuzzies ratingOne of the main functions for any carrying case or cover for an iPad, computer, cell phone, or camera is to protect it from accidental bumps and drops.  This Belkin folio cover could protect the edges of the iPad more than my Targus VuScape because the cover's edges extend outward beyond the perimeter of the iPad slightly more than on the Targus model.  The padding on the Belkin's back cover panel is comparable to the Targus model.  However, because the Belkin's front cover panel is so thin and flexible, and the front cover can buckle and warp so easily from even a slight sideways nudge due to the hinged area where a big groove runs across the inside of the front cover, if the Belkin cover was dropped and its magnetic-closure-tab edge or corners hit the floor or sidewalk first, the front cover would quickly get pushed away and the bulk of the impact's shock would be transmitted to either the edge of the iPad's case or the two rubber bumper corner clasps.  Because this Belkin folio's front cover, which covers the iPad screen when closed, is very thin and lacks the plush cushion that is built into the front cover of the Targus VuScape, if this Belkin folio cover was dropped onto a hard floor or sidewalk with the front cover (screen side) slamming onto the floor while you were carrying the folio cover closed-up with the iPad inside, the resulting impact would transmit more shock onto the iPad screen than a corresponding drop of the Targus VuScape folio cover.Compared to my Targus VuScape, the four rubber bumper corner clasps on this Belkin folio cover do hold the iPad against the back cover panel more securely than the stubby clasps on the Targus model.  The four corner clasps are part of a rectangular frame that is sewn into the inside of the back cover panel, and this frame is made of a flexible elastomer material called thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) that has good resistance to cracking, great durability, and excellent rubber-like elasticity.  TPU is also used in many brands of cell phone cases and covers because it offers both shock absorbency and abrasion resistance.  So while I like this approach better than how the Targus VuScape attaches to the iPad, the Belkin model is still too flexible and flimsy on its front and back covers compared to the Targus folio cover due to the lack of stiffness/thickness, and the Targus model also has far more protective padding on the front panel that covers the iPad's screen.&#9658; Auto-Wake Magnets: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Not-so-good 3-fuzzies ratingUnlike my Targus VuScape which does not use Auto-Wake Magnets, this Belkin model has hidden Auto-Wake Magnets that will conveniently wake up your iPad when you open up the cover.  However, this feature does not function very well due to two reasons: 1) in going from the 2nd-generation iPad to the 3rd-generation iPad, Apple changed the location and polarity of the magnets on its iPad, and 2) because the front cover is so flexible and shifts around a lot, it can easily buckle and pop up due to the hinged section of the front cover (and as previously mentioned, this hinged front cover is due to a deeper groove that is molded into the inside of the front cover and the front cover can fold along this grooved area).On the iPad 2, the sleep/wake magnet sensor was not polarity-specific.  And that led to an issue for iPad 2 users who flipped their smart covers around so that the cover sat flush with the back of the tablet, thus causing the iPad 2 to switch off unintentionally.  The new iPad 3 sleep/wake magnet sensor does require a specific polarity.  Belkin is now aware of this flaw in their Auto-Wake magnet design on their folios and cases for the 3rd-generation iPad, and on Belkin's Web site, they have a statement about this defect along with their recommendation for warranty replacement of their product if the Auto-Wake magnet is not working properly on your folio case (see the 'Comment' section of my review for the Belkin Web site URL describing this Auto-Wake problem).  I believe that Belkin has fixed this problem with later shipments of their iPad 3 folio covers.To further compound the Auto-Wake problems, because the magnetic closure tab holds the front cover so loosely when the front cover is closed on top of the iPad screen and because the way-too-flexible front cover can easily shift, buckle, and pop up due to its lack of stiffness and due to its hinged section that runs across the front cover, the front cover can easily move or pop up far enough to trick the iPad into waking up because it thinks that the front cover has been opened up.  So I think that both the lack of rigidity and the addition of the hinged section on the front cover both can cause the iPad to either not turn off when you close the cover on top of the iPad screen or to inadvertently turn itself on while you are carrying or transporting it around.  To minimize the possibility of your iPad prematurely waking up due to the front cover shifting during transport, thereby draining the battery, if you do turn on the Auto-Wake option on your iPad 'Settings', also turn on the Auto-Lock option and set the interval to 10 minutes or less.&#3051; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:If the erratic operation of the Auto-Wake magnets was the only issue that I had with this folio cover, I would give this product a 4-star rating.  But because the front and back cover panels on this Belkin product are so thin, flexible, flimsy, and inadequately padded for extra protection compared to my older Targus VuScape product, I must rate it only at 3 stars.  If Belkin could resolve the Auto-Wake magnet issue on their next version of this product so that it consistently works with both iPad 2 and iPad 3, and if they could make the front and back cover panels FAR stiffer (at least as stiff as the Targus VuScape) and add more protective cushion padding to the front and back cover panels, only then could this be a 5-star product.  This is not an inexpensive folio cover, especially when compared to competing products, so I was really hoping for a stiffer sturdier construction with more protective padding.\"", "I already have a clamshell cover with a keyboard for the iPad 2.  It's great for solid protection, but none of the controls along the edges of the iPad are accessible.  So I am quite pleased with the accessibility on this folio. And of course, the folio is much lighter.What does not seem to be working out is the stand, at least for where I use the iPad.  I mainly use it while sitting in an arm chair or when I'm propped up in bed.  The clamshell is much better for plopping on my lap.  With the folio, I end up wrapping the stand around the back and holding the whole thing like a clipboard. Since it is so light, that's not really a problem.  And it is easier to hold the iPad in the portrait position for reading books.The flap that holds the folio closed is a very convenient place for the stylus.  The clamshell does not provide anywhere for the stylus.I lucked out getting this folio to review, so I have both the folio and clamshell. If you have to choose, here are issues to consider:1. Do you need to have a solid case to protect the iPad when you travel? Clamshell2. Is weight a consideration? Folio3. Do you fiddle with the controls a lot? Folio4. Do you write a lot on the iPad? Clamshell with keyboardSince I received the folio, I have not put the iPad back into the clamshell.  That tells you which one is more convenient.", "\"The Belkin Cinema Dot Folio fits my iPad 2nd Generation perfectly. I am use to cases that are designed to slide the iPad in, but the corner tabs held the iPad snugly in place. The tab closure does keep the cover tightly closed when the device is not in use. In regards to the \"\"wake/sleep\"\" magnet function, it has its good and bad days. The only way I know is when I see that the battery has \"\"magically\"\" drained. I have been using the power button to manually put my iPad in sleep mode.One feature I really do like is being able to adjust the angled positions of the iPad. There are times I am viewing it at a sitting position and may have it adjusted at the highest angle, and sometimes I lay down on the floor with my kids and have it at a more laid down angle.It is made of a strange smelling synthetic leather which I hope lasts (not the smell but the material), but most items constructed of materials like this do not have a long life span. I guess time will tell. Overall, in my opinion this case is okay - I have used better cases that cost well below the MSRP.\"", "\"Belkin's Cinema Dot Folio case is NOT made of leather, but it has a very high quality feel and is a lot less bulky compared to other cases of the same type.What I like most about the design is the rubber corners that are used to hold the iPad in place. The rubber corners not only protect the iPad from bumps, they hold the iPad very securely while minimally intrude onto the glass surface or affect the clean look of the iPad. It is the best implementation I have seen yet.When installing your iPad, just slide the tablet into two corners, then push the third and forth corners toward the center. You should hear and feel \"\"clicks\"\", so that you know all four corners are properly fitted.While other cases generally have three angles for positioning the iPad stand, the Cinema Dot Folio has five. In fact, due to the synthetic material used that feels like fine felt, it provides a lot more friction to allow nearly INFINITE angle of adjustment. This is great.There is a magnetic clasp that keeps the two halves of the case together. The magnetic force is just right to keep it closed, while you do not need to pry it open when you need to use the iPad.There is a camera lens hole on the back of the case to allow the iPad to be used to take pictures and make video, without having to take it out of the case.I recommend this case for its superior design and materials.\"", "The Belkin Cinema Dot Folio with Stand for New Apple iPad 2 is a moderately  good product. It holds an iPad with reasonable security.  The cover does have a hole for the camera, however,  you can't use it, because, when the front cover is open to see the screen, it blocks the camera hole. Because of the way the front cover bends back, it can sometimes be a bit confusing as to the proper way to close the cover.It would be nice if it also had a place to put a pen, however, this is not the primary function of an iPad cover.That said, it serves its purpose and is getting plenty of use. It goes everywhere and holds up well.", "I have been working with this for a couple weeks now and it works for both gen II and III fine. I like that it's built to take a bit of abuse and the built in magnetic clasp also turn the screen of the ipad off as well.It has rigid parts where it needs to and the rest is nice and flexible so that it can hold up the ipad for nice browsing and working from a desk without having to lean over top of the desk to see the screen... It has several angles that you can adjust the screen and also there is a tab on the back side to fold it a little flatter for say on an airplane, you can also potentially use that tab to hook the ipad to the back of a seat to be able to sit back and watch a video/movie.Also it has a hole for the cameraClips in very tight, no worries about it coming out.overall, I like it a lot, very versatile and rather strong as well to prevent damage to the ipad. I wouldn't mind a little more padding to it but overall it works pretty good.", "This folio/stand from Belkin sports a classic look and is ideal for users shopping for a functional case that isn't too showy or out of place in the office. The black version looks very good and contemporary, though I'm not fond of the dot-man emblem on the lower part of the cover. The construction is solid and fits iPad 2 (mine is the 3G + WiFi) as well as the new iPad HD. I like the rubberized corners a lot. They grip the iPad frame and hold it very securely in place. The latch is magnetized and toggles on/off the screen when you open or close the cover. You don't have to worry about manually turning on or off the screen, a great convenience because the power button is already very small on the iPad and many cases make the button even harder to access.The cover folds back to a wide range of viewing angles so you can prop it up like a picture frame for easier and more ergonomic reading or video watching. The feet don't slip at all on the rubberized grooves. The cover latch is magnetized and can be folded back around so you have a clear, unobstructed view of the entire iPad. Some folios I've seen have the latch just dangling in front of the bezel, which I find very distracting.A small considerations to think about is the material of the folio. It picks up lint and dust very easily. Because of its texture, it's a bit difficult to brush off with your hands or blowing.Price is about average for iPad cases/folios and in line with other manufacturers, but not fantastic. Overall, a simply-designed and functional folio/cover for users who are looking for an understated and clean case without a lot of bells and whistles. I would've like a small pocket for papers or small inserts and a stylus holder, but I did not subtract points for this. Because it doesn't offer much protection and exposes the data port and headphone jack, I still need another pouch that zips up to put this in before I put it in my bag for transport.UPDATE: After only a day, the cover has gotten some white powder (maybe from bread) and specks all over it. (I'll admit to multitasking and iPadding.) The smudges are quite visible.UPDATE 2: The material is synthetic leather.UPDATE 3: Belkin has informed customers that due to a change in the iPad 3, some folio cases will not work with auto-wake. I have a new iPad and have confirmed this. Belkin has a support site where you can get a replacement.", "\"What's the difference between these two cases?  Well, the Cinema Dot Portfolio has dots while the Cinema Portfolio does not.  Very simple.Each case is seemingly identical except for slight differences in the trim pieces.  The Cinema Dot Portfolio has about a 2\"\" trim piece on the front and about a 4\"\" on the back that is perforated with small dots and it sort of looks like the seats on an older German car.  My \"\"gray and black\"\" Cinema Portfolio really looks more black than anything, but those aforementioned trim pieces have a slightly shiny blackish gray look to them.  The gray and black Cinema Portfolio also has contrasting stitching.I think the gray and black Cinema Portfolio looks slightly better to my tastes, but both of these cases are so similar that the differences are very minor.  But if you made me pick one over the other, I'd go with Cinema over Cinema Dot.The cases seem to be made with some sort of a poly type material.  While I prefer leather, it seems as if it will be durable.These portfolios have magnets embedded in the cover flap which turns the iPad on or off when you open or close the cover.  A magnetic flap secures the cover in place.These cases use a four-point mounting system that attaches to the corners of the iPad only.  I've typically preferred a case that wraps around the entire iPad rather than just attaching to the corners, but the iPad does seem very secure, so I'm sure this is fine.The case is very thin and lightweight.  While it provides some level of protection, I'd say it's a minimal level of protection nonetheless.  I use a different brand of leather portfolio case typically and it seems to be a bit more protective than the Belkin.I think that these are pretty nice cases.  Not the best mind you, but still pretty good.  The fit is perfect, they look pretty nice,  hold the iPad in place properly, and allow for display at a number of different angles/orientations.I think that 4 stars is a fair rating for this product.  It is well designed and should hold up reasonably well.  Just don't drop the iPad in this case though, as I doubt it would provide much protection.\"", "The Belkin Folio for our Apple iPad2 has many unique and handy features such as the outer velcro pocket that you can carry pens and a cell phone in. I also like the ability to slide the iPad into the rubber corners on the bottom and top strap to form a shelf. This helps prop the iPad up for easy viewing. The cover also helps protect the iPad during transport. There are a couple pitfalls that I've found: The stand is not that sturdy and really doesn't stay up that well, especially if you're an 'elbows on the table and lean in' type. Also, the 'secure' part is not always that secure while moving so use caution during transport. There are no zippers or straps holding the flap shut, just your hands as you carry it. This can prove a hazard for a clumsy person or if you carry many things at once, etc. Although this type may work well for some people, I don't rely on it for transport and place it inside a backpack or another case. However, I do love the added protection, zippered pocket on the outside of the case, and the easy to wash nylon cover. A good product, but I'd like to see just a couple things added like strap ties or zippers to hold it together for added safety in transport. Unless I can find one with that added feature I probably won't include it on my Christmas gift list for my friends.", "I recently upgraded my iPad to the newest version so the offer for this cover was quite timely. My iPad easily and quickly popped into the frame with very little effort but has been 100% secure for the several weeks I have used it. The magnetic tab holds the cover closed when not in use and also holds the cover in place when folded behind the device for hand-held operation. The cover also includes the auto-wake magnets that work well with that feature of the new iPad. The cover has several angles available when using it as a stand in front of the device and has a tab in the back that also allows the cover to be folded back and used as a stand in that position only.I do not know how much protection this case would be if the iPad were dropped because that has not been put to the test (and I hope it won't be). I also have not used my iPad for photographs yet so am not sure how this case would work for that. There is a good possibility that it could be awkward since it would cover the camera when folded back.Overall, I am perfectly happy with this case with only 2 exceptions.1) It would be nice to have an option for a portrait view stand for reading.2) I have to be certain that the cover is closed properly or the device does not turn off which drains the battery. I solve that problem by turning it off manually.", "There are so many iPad cases for so many manufacturers, in fact from Belkin alone there seems to be more too many to understand.This specific case duplicates the smart cover functionality that apple pioneered starting with the iPad 2.  It adds to this by instead of using magnets to hold it on, instead using a harder form fitted backing.  This allows for a different cover attachment point, and allows more positions.  It's well built, feels solid, easy to put the ipad in and out of it, and allows multiple positions for easy typing/reading/watching.  It appears to be quite durable, although because of the attachments and case itself it can be slightly bulky and awkward to handle.", "\"There are a lot of things to like about this cover.  .. It looks great.  . .It's sturdy.  .. It holds my iPad tight. . . . I love the way it easily flips-out for different angles. . .  Love the magnetic clip.  But there are a few of things which are \"\"not-so-great\"\".  The first thing is the price.  In my opinion, it's currently very over-priced.  Second, it would have been nice if they made it to hold a stylus.  Finally, it picks-up lint etc. very easily.  The fabric feels quite porous and though I haven't spilled anything on it. . . yet. . .  I have the feeling that it might ruin the case.  I did try a little water, and it didn't absorb and it wiped off without a problem.  But something like ketchup would a completely different story.\"", "\"This is a very nice case that not only protects the iPad but looks professional as well.  The \"\"auto-wake\"\" magnets are a nice feature, but I notice they don't always work as advertised.  Sometimes the iPad turns on even when closed and sometimes it doesn't turn on when you open it.  It hasn't been a big problem so far, but it's kind of annoying and could potentially cause the battery to drain faster.  My favorite feature of it is the adjustable stand which makes viewing movies very easy and comfortable.  The angle can be adjusted for comfort, and it works when tapping on the screen as well (as long as it's at a low angle).  Very nice cover.\"", "I was reluctant to try this case because I owned a sleeve for my iPad and was happy with it. Cases seem to bulk up the device, and make it heavier and awkward, which, to me, eliminates the purpose of having a thin, sleek tablet to begin with.But, at the prompting of my wife, I decided to give the Belkin Cinema Dot Folio a try. And I'm glad I did.It's important to note that this case with fit either the iPad3 or the iPad2, since they are identical in size. It's also important to note that the iPad only correctly fits one way so that the button is accessible (I mistakenly had it backwards).When I first opened the package, both my wife and I had to plug our noses as a strong balloon-like odor emanated from the black surface. I'm glad to say that this slowly went away after about a week's time.The iPad itself rests against a rubber backing, which helps to absorb shocks should it get dropped. There's also a good, non-slip grip on the outside for ease of carrying. On the back is a camera hole so that pictures and video clips can be taken while in the case.I was impressed by how unobtrusive the clips were that attached the iPad. Unlike so many cases that cover a good portion of the screen, this one simply holds down the edges of the four corners. Not only that, but they are rubberized so there is no risk to the screen. There's also no shifting or play, it attaches tight and securely, yet is still easy to remove.The cover is magnetic, which means when you close it, it automatically turns off the iPad. Likewise, when you open it, the iPad turns on. This is similar to how Apple's Smart Cover works, but the advantage of the Belkin Cinema Dot Folio is that it protects both the front and back of the device.At first, I was annoyed by the Tab (which keeps the case shut). When opened, it hung loose and got in the way. But after a moment's revelation, I realized that the magnetized strip also worked when reverse folded. This way, whether the cover is open, shut, or set up as a stand, the tab easily holds against the case, keeping it out of the way.Speaking of the stand, when the cover is unfolded, it can be used to prop up and angle the iPad--sort of like a standing picture frame. Didn't think I'd care that much for this feature, but after standing the device on my kitchen counter to read recipes, and setting it on my daughter's bed for interactive storybooks, my mindset changed. Also worth noting is that the stand holds the iPad well, without easily slipping.Overall, I'm quite happy with this case. My biggest complaint is that the cover seems to pick up dirt and dust fairly easily (I have the black version), but a simple wipe with a wet rag gets it off. In the end, I was surprised how much I like the Belkin Cinema Dot Folio--considering I usually prefer a sleeve, and don't like bulky cases. But this one doesn't feel overly bulky like so many others, and the extra features make it worth the change. And so I gave my sleeve away to a friend because, with the Belkin, I knew I no longer needed it.", "I am giving this case 4 stars even though it does not work for me. I use my 2nd gen iPad for FaceTime and Skype 80% of the time.  The angles of this case are simply not that great for video use.  I need to tip it forward to catch the kids on camera well.I do not want to give less than 4 stars because the case is durable and strong and has great adjustable angles for watching videos, checking e mails and using other apps.  It is a bit heavier than my smart cover. If you are mainly a video watcher, this may be a great cover/stand for you.", "The Belkin Folio is a pretty standard case for the Ipad with the added bonus of having a stand that has multiple viewing angles.  For starters, the folio is made of a suede like material that feels nice on the hands, but I will say, also picks up a lot of lent.  I'm a stickler for putting my Ipad in my purse, or somewhere safe, but it nearly always seems to pick up lint that is decidedly difficult to brush off as it likes to cling to the material.  The inside material that protects the screen is an even softer material; however, it also has five strips across the area as this is the key feature that helps to stand your Ipad up.  Each strip is made up of four mini groves that are not raised, but inset into the material, so you don't have to worry about raised groves caressing your Ipad's screen.  The area that actually houses the Ipad is made up of a soft plastic like material that is very flexible, so it's extremely easy to put your Ipad in place.  The back of the holding area also raises up about halfway from the back cover, and the left side edge is then fitted into one of the grooves on the opposite side to hold the Ipad up for, say, viewing movies.  So far, I have had no issues with my Ipad slipping or falling over when I use the folio as a stand, and that's a very big bonus in my book.  Plus I love the magnetic closer, and the fact that when I want to hold my Ipad for reading a book, I can easily bend the cover back, and the magnetic closer then sticks to the back also, so it is out of my way.  The wake feature is pretty darn nice too, but I did have a few issues with it as there is a little bit of a gap between my Ipad's screen and the front cover, which causes it to randomly come on.  This especially holds true when putting it in a purse or bag.  The back of the cover has a small hole at the top for the camera to peep through if you want to take a quick photo too, but I will mention that it is a bit awkward.  For starters you have to hold the whole thing open as you can't bend the front cover back or it'll cover the camera hole.  I do believe the overall quality of the folio could be better, but it does what it's made to do: protect my Ipad while also providing different ways to view it!", "I had the smart cover from Apple but in time I started to notice slight dings behind my iPad. So I decided to get this. I am very happy with it.", "This is my first case for my first iPad. Like the other reviewers, I found the case to have a strong chemical smell and while I don't find it unpleasant, it is definitely strong and lingering well after a week. Overall, I find the functionality of this case to be somewhat annoying and cumbersome to use. While I appreciate how well the iPad is secured to the case by each of the four corners, I do not find the spine to be rigid enough and the case is often shifting when you hold it with the cover folded back. (horizontal or vertical.)If you use the case as a stand on anything that is not a flat surface, is very easy to knock over. (collapse) If you have it on a bed or on your lap it can easily be collapsed with a single touch which I find to completely defeat the purpose of a stand to begin with. I have also had it collapse a few times even on a rigid surface- really annoying.I want to like the way that case looks but the dot fabric on the on the cover is crooked - the dots don't line up which make it look cheap.I can't recommend this case and will be looking for something to replace it.", "TheCinema Dot Folio with Stand for New Apple iPad 3rd Generation, HD, 1080P, WiFi, 4G LTE, AT&T;, Verizon (Black/Grey)is a full sized case to protect both the back and screen of your iPad 2 or 3.  It has four rigid corners to hold your iPad in place.  It's thicker than the stock case, but it provides more protection and it's also more attractive.  There are a few drawbacks, but it's worth consideration.PROS:++ Attractive synthetic material with perforated dot pattern++ Surface has a tacky almost suede-like texture that is nice to hold++ Felt lined front cover protects the screen when closed++ Magnetic clasp keeps the case closed and folds away when opened++ Cradle corners add stability without obstructing the screen++ Can be used as a stand at multiple viewing angles++ Nice liner color options, including understated black or bold color options++ Works for the new iPad (3) or the iPad 2CONS:-- Magnets are unreliable for iPad sleep / wake mode-- Case adds thickness, much more than advertised-- Material has strange chemical odor (may go away with time and use)-- No loop for optional stylus-- No internal sleeve for document storage-- Case provides minimal padding despite its thickness-- Front cover flexes when closed, exposing the iPad's corners-- Premium cost compared to alternativesCONCLUSIONThis is an attractive case that is worth considering if style is a key factor for you.  While it is functional enough, several of the drawbacks are of concern.  Perhaps the problem changing between sleep and awake modes exists with many cases.  But some of the other flaws coupled with the case's premium cost provide enough reasons to consider alternatives in addition to this one.Happy Shopping.", "I like this.........It works well with the ipad 2. It's made of a thick hard outter layer, so when you want to treat your ipad like a laptop, the back piece actually stays up to support it. I've had other products in the past where after 2 uses, the backing gets flimsy and always falls. It also protects your ipad well.I like Belkin products, theyve always been a very well made, good product that has worked well for me.", "The Belkin Cinema Dot Folio Stand for New Apple IPAD 2 in black gray is very convenient and well-made. For thirty dollars and free PRIME or Super Saver Shipping just an okay deal. I've gotten IPAD cases for under twenty dollars that were just as effective.", "I purchased this case for my wife's IPAD 3.The case is well built, offers great protection around the edges.The magnets work with the autosleep feature (when you close the case lid, the IPAD screen turns off - hibirnates?)The case looks great, the purple trim color is feminine, but not too overpowering.  The kick stand features work well.I recommend this product and would purchase again.  It is the right mix of functionality and price.", "\"We ordered (2) Belkin iPad covers, one for my husband and one for me. Both are very very similar in design and overall looks. This Belkin iPad case is well designed.We had originally purchased Apple's \"\"smart cover\"\" when we ordered the the new iPad 3s. The concern was, it offered no protection for the back of the iPad, although we loved the way the iPad looked with the \"\"smart cover\"\".The Belkin Cover overall is a good cover:** The iPad fits into the case very securely and looks like a small portfolio, protecting both the front and the back of the iPad.** The case acts as a stand as well.  The cover puts the iPad into sleep mode when closed -- the same as the smart cover but with total protection.** The cover is some type of synthetic material that my husband likes, but me looks a bit cheap....it's not leather. This cover does add to the overall weight of the iPad in comparison to the \"\"smart cover\"\".** Although my husband doesn't use the camera feature on the iPad, I do and I felt it's important to note that this cover makes it awkward to use the camera feature of the iPad. (Not impossible, just awkward).A decent product, but not perfect.\"", "My problem with this ipad cover is that when closed there is such a large v shaped gap between the screen and the case that, if the iPad is in my bag many things can and do get inside. Things like pens for example. This gap also means my iPad  gets switched on without my knowledge resulting in a a drained battery.  I notice no other reviewer mentions this so maybe I have a defective case  but it is unusable to me.My iPad 2 fits securely in this cover and I have confidence that it won't fall out so that's a positive. It's also a pretty good stand. So I'll probably keep it in a drawer and use it f I need to prop up the pad to watch a movie or something but it's not much use to me otherwise", "\"This is a very nice case for the Ipad. Using it for a \"\"new Ipad\"\" (3rd Generation) and it works well. It holds the device in very securely and closes nicely. The case has built in magnets that sleep the ipad when the case is closed just like a Smart Cover does, and this is a real nice feature.Great case for anyone in the market for a new iPad case\"", "I am an engineer, and I couldn't believe it when I tested this case for my iPad 3rd generation and found that the magnetic closure does not work properly to ensure that the iPad sleeps when you close it. It constantly turns the iPad on and off when it is closed while carrying it and picking it up/putting it down, and drains the battery when it turns on the iPad constantly. I had to cut out the magnet to feel comfortable using this cover.Too pricey for what it does."], "Gamma": [0.16996437311172485, 0.17009538412094116, 0.0004800391907338053, 0.17009538412094116, 0.16912873089313507, 0.15014073252677917, 0.17009538412094116], "Beta": [[4.3701002141460776e-05, 0.009013962000608444, 0.003546603722497821, 0.003324985271319747, 0.14770054817199707, 0.030777951702475548, 0.0023529024329036474, 0.0040364512242376804, 0.002778372960165143, 0.053741633892059326, 0.08458279818296432, 0.12812970578670502, 0.13021250069141388, 0.0001465847308281809, 0.004136194009333849, 0.08230165392160416, 0.09904757887125015, 0.033714696764945984, 0.00014098059909883887, 0.10255246609449387, 0.001616213470697403, 0.0654650330543518, 0.0007316185510717332, 0.0006440785364247859, 0.0036038579419255257, 0.005656961351633072], [4.3676998757291585e-05, 0.00901312381029129, 0.0035454772878438234, 0.003324681892991066, 0.14770181477069855, 0.030774377286434174, 0.0023520903196185827, 0.004036481026560068, 0.0027768949512392282, 0.05374239757657051, 0.08458366990089417, 0.12813104689121246, 0.13021284341812134, 0.00014655684935860336, 0.004136527888476849, 0.0823022648692131, 0.09904861450195312, 0.03371501341462135, 0.00014094322978053242, 0.10255435854196548, 0.0016154289478436112, 0.06546654552221298, 0.0007312247762456536, 0.0006439053104259074, 0.0036025429144501686, 0.005657529458403587], [0.00019389773660805076, 0.016099460422992706, 0.007466514594852924, 0.005515319760888815, 0.13678771257400513, 0.04160403087735176, 0.007074377033859491, 0.004984049126505852, 0.004424062557518482, 0.054583415389060974, 0.07951220124959946, 0.11884637176990509, 0.12203580141067505, 0.00039069648482836783, 0.006975746713578701, 0.07798661291599274, 0.09237886965274811, 0.03393314778804779, 0.00043315812945365906, 0.09587576240301132, 0.00505546759814024, 0.06458859145641327, 0.003097780281677842, 0.0019408764783293009, 0.009510071016848087, 0.008706060238182545], [4.3676998757291585e-05, 0.00901312381029129, 0.0035454772878438234, 0.003324681892991066, 0.14770181477069855, 0.030774377286434174, 0.0023520903196185827, 0.004036481026560068, 0.0027768949512392282, 0.05374239757657051, 0.08458366990089417, 0.12813104689121246, 0.13021284341812134, 0.00014655684935860336, 0.004136527888476849, 0.0823022648692131, 0.09904861450195312, 0.03371501341462135, 0.00014094322978053242, 0.10255435854196548, 0.0016154289478436112, 0.06546654552221298, 0.0007312247762456536, 0.0006439053104259074, 0.0036025429144501686, 0.005657529458403587], [4.3854175601154566e-05, 0.009019303135573864, 0.003553790505975485, 0.003326919162645936, 0.14769238233566284, 0.030800752341747284, 0.002358090365305543, 0.004036260303109884, 0.0027878081891685724, 0.05373677611351013, 0.0845772922039032, 0.12812106311321259, 0.1302102506160736, 0.00014676280261483043, 0.004134069662541151, 0.08229772746562958, 0.09904088079929352, 0.03371269628405571, 0.00014121903222985566, 0.1025405079126358, 0.0016212211921811104, 0.06545548886060715, 0.000734132481738925, 0.0006451841327361763, 0.003612254513427615, 0.0056533413007855415], [4.454141162568703e-05, 0.009088505990803242, 0.003591235727071762, 0.0033523202873766422, 0.14732475578784943, 0.030828719958662987, 0.002367611275985837, 0.004096155520528555, 0.0028288057073950768, 0.05388524755835533, 0.08459527790546417, 0.12787513434886932, 0.1299630105495453, 0.0001494568568887189, 0.004213618114590645, 0.08232107758522034, 0.0989815816283226, 0.03389184549450874, 0.00014374921738635749, 0.10248114168643951, 0.0016176470089703798, 0.0656009092926979, 0.0007343476172536612, 0.0006552626146003604, 0.0036107520572841167, 0.0057572475634515285], [4.3676998757291585e-05, 0.00901312381029129, 0.0035454772878438234, 0.003324681892991066, 0.14770181477069855, 0.030774377286434174, 0.0023520903196185827, 0.004036481026560068, 0.0027768949512392282, 0.05374239757657051, 0.08458366990089417, 0.12813104689121246, 0.13021284341812134, 0.00014655684935860336, 0.004136527888476849, 0.0823022648692131, 0.09904861450195312, 0.03371501341462135, 0.00014094322978053242, 0.10255435854196548, 0.0016154289478436112, 0.06546654552221298, 0.0007312247762456536, 0.0006439053104259074, 0.0036025429144501686, 0.005657529458403587]]}
