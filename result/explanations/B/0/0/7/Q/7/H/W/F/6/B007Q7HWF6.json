"], "reviews": ["Parents looking for a fun tablet might want to consider that this one is designed to be used with Vinci curriculum, that grows with your child.  So you would purchase curriculum based on age and then again when they moved to the next age group.  For parents, that's nice because you know that the apps, games, and stories are age appropriate.My impressions - it's a little bulky (weighing about 1-1/2 pounds).  However, it has grips that make it easy for a young child to grip and carry.  They are cushioned and are meant to help protect your screen should it be dropped.  I feel that parents with young toddlers are best for this product as investing heavily in to the curriculum for an older child may not make as much financial sense.  The cheapest curriculum is about $90 online and the most expensive one (for older toddlers) is close to $180 (nearly as much as the tablet).  Therefore, it makes the most sense to have it grow with your child rather than have your child grow out of it quickly.There wasn't a whole lot pre-loaded on it, so you'd definitely want to bear the need to purchase curriculum in mind.  The graphics were OK, and I liked that the stories were interactive, meaning that you could choose Little Red Riding Hood's clothing, what she wanted to take to Grandma's, which pet accompanied her, etc.  That makes the story a little more fun and different each time.There is a camera (rear facing), but I didn't think it took clear pictures, but a kid would probably be happy with it.", "The Vinci tab II is  an engaging product to use with many cool features. There are some great features that I will lay out. But even with those features I just think the product is average at best primarily because of other options and the cost of the curriculum.  I do think it is worth checking out if you are in the market for a 'toddler tablet' but there are better options. The technology feels somewhat dated and the curriculum is very expensive.The tablet itself is a functional android tablet running 2.3.5. There is no screen rotate and no pinch zoom either. Clearly compared to a non-toddler app the specs and performance as a computer are not anywhere near the competition. The screen itself is better than I expected from the specs. Photos display nicely. Apps are bright and colorful. Not the best screen resolution, but the Vinci apps make very good use of it. The unit is also on the slow side. But you do get the cushioned red handle around the device. It turns out this is very functional. Our 25 month old is able to carry it around and it does provide some cushioning. It does really help make it so a toddler can carry it around. However the device is heavy. Too heavy for her? No. But it feels like the unit itself is heavier than regular tablets and then you add the weight of the bumper. Overall the tablet as a tablet is pretty far behind a friend's Fire HD I have used.Prior to this I was in the iOS universe. For the Vinci I was able to create a Google account that instantly linked to the Vinci from the unit itself. It did take a number of tries though. After that I was able to access the market and download a number of apps that have all worked just fine. You also have access to apps on the Vincigenius website. I urge any perspective buyer to go to that website first. You will be a lot of information about the 3 levels of curriculum available as well as what is termed the Kids Library. Let me get to my impression of the curriculum. I do not have the full curriculum to review but there are samples. And on the website there are demos (YouTube videos) of all the apps. I actually like them. They are well thought out and concept based. Here is the problem; the cost. I was interested in the level 2 for my daughter. But at $140 there are only 12 apps you get for that. As good as they are, there are hundreds of great Apps for the Android market and for sure for iOS. As just one example I recently picked up Toca House for 99 cents. There is a ton of stuff to do with that. The first level you get 13 apps for $80. If that level and the other 2 levels were similar or a little below that, then this would be a much different product all together.That being said there are some positives with the software and other options that I don't think have been brought up yet. One is the Kids Library I alluded to above. If you get this product one of the first things you want to do is register it and create an account. Under Kids Library there a number of apps. A lot of them are free. There is a bit of a strange way of getting them on your Vinci but this is how you do it. Say you have bought some or gotten some free ones. You go to a website on the browser in your Vinci tablet itself. From that website you download a Vinci Kids Library app. Why that app is not preinstalled I have no idea. Once that app is downloaded you sign in with the same email and password that you used to register your device inside that app. Once you do that, any app that you got from the Vincigenius website will show up for download and install. Some of the free ones have been quite good, but most of them offer very little interaction. They are for watching.You do get a few curriculum apps preinstalled with the device. You get 2 preinstalled apps for level II and level III curriculum but they are light versions with only some features available. For level I you get 2 light versions but then also 6 `samples'. The samples are pretty good at least as good as the light versions but the 2 light versions are repeated in that 6. The samples show the quality of the curriculum. I think the quality is good. Concepts are presented, they are engaging, they will challenge your youngster, they are very decent apps. But then there is the price. You also get 8 lullabies and 12 songs pre-loaded. Our daughter really enjoys these. They make good use of animals and bright colors.Some other positives: even the free apps in the Kids Library have no ads, no in app purchase. I like this a lot. It is a definite plus. Easy parents mode. When parents mode is on isn't on there is no way to get to the web or open up other apps like facebook, angry birds, etc.In the end, I think this is a really great concept, that was executed pretty well: but at a pretty high cost and with mediocre technology. As I stated at first go to the Vincigenius website if interested in the product. You can get a feel for the curriculum and see what you think. Also for sure go to the Kids library and browse through those apps. I will say that I think the pre-loaded items are better than people are giving Vinci credit for. Compared to most tablets having nothing but the apps you can download for free, you get some nice pre-loaded software. The problem with this product is all the technology exploding around it and what they are charging for the curriculum. I don't have a Fire HD but from the specs for both, you can't even compare the 2. Fire HD runs away hands down.But the Fire doesn't have the handles or the pre-loaded software. You also get a micro SD slot with the Vinci which is nice. And the Vinci software doesn't run except on Vinci tabs. My experience though with the iOS app-verse is that there are a multitude of highly engaging and well done apps there that will cost you a fraction of what the curriculum does for the Vinci. I would be willing to pay say $5 at the most for a Vinci app from what I see from the light versions. And even that is being super generous compared to what you can get on the Market or iTunes. But Vinci is asking for upwards of $10 an app for level II and level III and I personally cannot justify it. Had the level 2, the one I am interested in now been say $60 I'd have given the product 4 stars and would be getting the curriculum myself. But $140 even with the `assessment' software (something many iOS apps do anyway), it is just way too much. I am giving the product 3 stars though, even with the negatives, because our daughter does like it. Even though the apps are on the simple side they are lesson focused and she engages with them. If more were pre-loaded (even the lite versions which are useful) or the curriculum were less costly I would highly recommend the Vinci.In the end although I haven't tried it personally you might want to check out theFuhu NABI NABI2-NV7A 7-Inch Tablet. It seems a better overall product.", "I wasn't quite sure if I really wanted to give this product a try because I limit the amount of screen time I allow my kids, but I watched some of the videos and was intrigued by what I saw.  It looked like a toy that could potentially be beneficial to my three-year-old son.  I saw some complaints about the cost of the software suites, but I figured I'd try the product and see if I thought it might be a good thing to invest in.  After testing it for the last month, I am not at all impressed with this product and wouldn't recommend it.  In no particular order, here are the main reasons why I think this product is a waste of money.Unacceptable battery life--For the first couple of days, the battery life seemed okay.  It didn't last as long as I might have expected, but I didn't think much of it.  However, over time, the battery has deteriorated to the point that the tablet is almost unusable.  After charging until the indicator shows the battery is at 100%, I'll remove it from the charger and the battery is immediately at only  life.  At most, the tablet lasts for about an hour before the supposedly full battery drains and the tablet has to be recharged.  Charging it and then putting it away for future use is pointless, as the battery drains while the unit sits idle.Lack of parent lock--This is such a no-brainer to me.  When creating a tablet that's expressly for the use of a toddler, doesn't it make sense to include features that allow parents to control things like whether the child can change the names of folders or delete apps?  At this point, I have no idea how much content my son may have deleted.  I also would have liked settings that would allow me to lock the tablet after allowing my son a certain amount of time to play.App not working properly--Monkey and Banana Lite has not worked since the day I received the tablet.  I've tried rebooting the unit (something I've had to do repeatedly) to no avail.  Since the tablet comes pre-loaded with so few apps, this is a big deal.  If Vinci is trying to convince me to spend upwards of $100 on a suite of apps, it seems to me that the sample apps they provide as an enticement ought to work.Quality of apps--The apps that do work properly are interesting.  One that my son particularly likes asks the child to pair a baby animal with its mother.  He has a lot of fun reuniting the families.  The storybooks are also fun and interactive, and he enjoys the music videos, but this is part of the problem.  Oftentimes, when he has the tablet, he does nothing but watch these videos.  While they're fun and entertaining, they're not what I would call educational.  There does seem to be some educational value to the regular apps, though even this is a bit hard to determine as there are so few samples included.  But would I really call this an educational toy?  My answer to that is no.  What I've seen of the Vinci hasn't been enough to convince me that buying the software suite would do anything to further my son's skills and abilities.The only reason I haven't given this product one star is because I don't think the software is entirely without merit.  But is it good enough to negate the terrible quality of the tablet itself, as well as justify the cost of the tablet and the software?  I can certainly think of better ways of spending upward of $500.  I'll stick with low tech things like taking my son to story groups, visiting children's museums, and spending time playing at the park.", "Like others' reviews, the first thing I noticed was the sturdy built of this tablet.  The soft red handle around the screen makes this easy to hold.  Why don't all tablets have this feature?But soon my impression went down a notch after I plugged it into an AC outlet to charge it and then use it.  Both took a while.  The plug fits right near the red handle; it would have made more sense to have the plug slightly away from the handle so that the adapter cable would have free access to the charge.  Because of the AC location the tablet must be on a flat surface to recharge.Turning this on reminded me of my Kindle Fire.  This is a very slow device (and the reason I don't use my K-Fire anymore).Owners must register this product online.  From the company's website one can get both free apps and additional learning software for young children.  The apps are simple games that will keep young children entertained on a long roadtrip as they are easy to play.  Just make sure the device is near a charging unit as the juice only lasts a few hours.", "I love the idea for this a tablet that works for young children that they can throw on the floor and it won't break. I love the camera, but you have to buy software and it was expensive. I wouldn't buy it again.", "The other reviewers have done a great job listing the pro's and con's of this tablet... con's being expensive software, bugs in the software, slow WI-FI speed, and the biggest one of all for me is the price/value ratio.  Now that Kindles etc have come down so much in price, why spend all this money for a toy this limited and specialized?  If you're just looking for something to give a toddler to chew on and keep him/her away from your ipad, this is a good candidate if the price comes down, but really this is an expensive failed experiment.Sorry, can't recommend at this price.", "\"The VINCI Tab II tablet is a piece of hardware that must be used with one or more of the following software/application programs for it to be the learning tablet for which it is intended to be used:VINCI Curriculum Level 1: The CuriousVINCI Curriculum Level 2: The ConfidentVINCI Curriculum Level 3: The CapableThese are the three fundamental developmental phase oriented apps that VINCI offers for use with the tablet and without at least one of these apps the tablet is little more than an expensive toy/basic Android tablet. Therefore you must factor in the cost of whichever app or apps you anticipate using with this tablet when considering whether or not to invest in this system (i.e., the system = the tablet plus apps which must be purchased separately). (The VINCI Tab II comes loaded with some rudimentary apps that hardly seem worth the $90 value stated on the box).Buying the VINCI Tab II plus one or more of the apps necessary to use it for its intended purpose is an investment on top of which one must be willing and able to invest time and energy into seeing that it gets used as intended. For otherwise, it will be like an expensive piece of exercise equipment that one buys with high hopes and the best of intentions but rarely uses.You can get a sense of what actually using the VINCI system as a learning tool entails by visiting the VINCI site. The basic idea behind the VINCI system is that children plus mobile devices with educational apps are a good combination that can really help a child's development. Keep in mind that this can be accomplished with devices and apps other than those marketed and produced by VINCI. The VINCI Tab II is unique in that it is physically designed to be used by children, but I can tell you that my 4 year old granddaughter has been using her parents' iPad regularly for a couple of years now and has never mistreated or dropped it (though her toddler brother managed to chip the screen but is now also learning to use and handle it correctly) and is able to use educational and entertainment apps geared toward her age group skillfully and without adult supervision. (The VINCI Tab II has a parent mode so adults can use it as an Android tablet and iPad has parental controls so children can use it without accessing whatever their parents don't want them to access on it. At their site, VINCI asks, \"\"Why Choose VINCI Over Other Children's Tablets?\"\" and naturally suggests that VINCI is the best possible choice. But of course one doesn't have to only choose between VINCI and other \"\"Children's Tablets\"\" given that tablets designed for use by adults usually have parental controls and many educational apps for children are available for them.)Unless and until one can find Consumer Reports type independent research on the VINCI system (the hardware plus the software), research that has studied actual end-users over time, those who buy it are essentially experimental subjects. And here's something else to consider: If a VINCI system doesn't work out for your child or children, you'll end up with expensive software you cannot use and a very simple, basic Android tablet/piece of hardware designed for use by toddlers and young children, whereas if you instead try a tablet designed for adults in parental mode with age-appropriate educational software and that doesn't work out for your child or children, you will still have a fully-functioning tablet that you can use and you won't have spent nearly as much on apps as you will have spent on apps for the VINCI.\"", "I got the VINCI tab through the Amazon Vine program to review.  The main user of this has been my 5 year old son, but I've been the one doing all of the App installs on it.First of all I'll just do a quick list of pro and cons:Pros:- Red Rubber bumper makes it easy to hold and durable.- Android operation system, so you can put a Google account on here and access Play Store Apps- Very nice big screen- Includes some nice games/apps- You can get free apps, books, and games from Vinci's learning library online- WiFi connection works well and is easy to set up- Very nice looking, just like mom and dad's tablets!Cons:- Runs very slow; this definitely isn't even close to an iPad or Android Tablet speed- Many games don't work on here (for example Angry Birds)- Many apps don't run while in Parent Mode- Short battery life; you can get maybe 2-3 hours out of this.- Difficult to charge; the charger doesn't stay in well and it charges intermittently- Formal curriculum from Vinci is very expensive- Free Vinci apps are mediocre in qualityThe biggest plus to this tablet is that it runs the Android operating system.  This allows you to download numerous education, or just for fun, apps from the Google Play store.  That being said a number of the apps we downloaded from the Google Play store didn't run on this tablet.  So, none of the Angry Birds will work on here but Where's My Water worked fine.The red bumper is a nice feature, this is rubberized so it prevents the tablet from falling off of things and protects it if it is dropped.The formal curriculum from Vinci is very expensive, $100+ for each program.  But Vinci does offer a number of free e-books and apps in their learning library.  I downloaded a number of these apps and found them to be variable in quality.  Some of them were great, for example a Pirate E-book that lets you interact with the story.  Some wouldn't even run.  Additionally many of the apps would not run if you are logged in in parent mode, but ran fine once I excited parent mode.The parent mode allows you full access to the Android platform; it lets you access the internet and install apps.  When out of parent mode you cannot install applications or access the full menu.The other disappointing thing is how slow this runs.  Load times on games/books are incredibly long (up to a minute or more) and things just run slow on here.  It's a far cry from playing games on a smartphone or an adult tablet.  My son was continually getting frustrated with how long he had to wait to start up.The last disappointing thing is the charging.  The battery only last 2-3hrs while playing on the tablet.  It uses a std micro-USB charger.  But for some reason it only charge intermittently.  I left it on the charge all night only to find out that it hadn't charged.  I had to push the charger in just right and prop the tablet up so that it wouldn't wiggle the charger to finally get it to charge.  This is really obnoxious and might be defect in the product I received.Overall it's nice to have a kid designed tablet on the Android platform.  It is a very slow tablet though, many apps don't work on it, and I had difficulty charging it.  I don't think I can recommend buying this based on the cost; that is unless you are really into Vinci's curriculum for some reason.In the end my son doesn't use it much because it is so slow and so many apps don't work on it.  Instead I think he is going to inherit my old Nexus One smartphone.  Yes the screen is smaller on the Nexus One but it's much faster and apps actually work on it.", "The Vinci tablet is a great device for kids 2-5. The size is more manageable for little people than an ipad or other tablet and the rubber border grips provide both protection and a place for little hands to hold the tablet.  The tablet comes pre-loaded with a few curriculum selections that include some fun games for young kids, some music videos and other educational content that help kids match colors, emotions, and animals using songs and fun interactive scenarios. With big icons on the screen it's easy for the kids to navigate around and get into different nodes for a varied experience every time. Plus you can load your own movies, music and photos onto the device. The downfall of this android compatible tablet is that for an ipad user it's not as intuitive to navigate around the menus changing the time, loading movies and music. I tried to move some of my kid's favorite movies onto the desktop but it was pretty cumbersome and confusing.One more challenge to this tablet is that the tablet doesn't automatically shut off. Often my kids will finish using it and lay it aside as it slowly drains the battery. To make matters worse the charger provided doesn't work very well. We were able to use an android cell phone charger which worked much Bette at charging the tablet back up.The best thing about this device is that you can load it up with learning curriculum to match your kids needs and skills. The curriculum is a little expensive which is the only drawback. Even so, the pre-loaded games and capabilities of this make this a good buy at just under $200."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10531909018754959, 0.13464681804180145, 0.11704123765230179, 0.09539693593978882, 0.12485833466053009, 0.11845654994249344, 0.10555191338062286, 0.11155767738819122, 0.08717147260904312]]}
