So when the Taiwanese manufacturer of computer accessories and peripherals, KYE Systems, introduced this Genius-brand mouse at the start of this year, touting it as the \"\"world's first battery-free wireless mouse\"\", I thought to myself, \"\"Wow, why hasn't anyone thought of this concept before?!?\"\" And as far as I can tell from performing numerous Internet searches, there is currently no other computer mouse on the market that is powered like this DX-ECO mouse right now.Instead of relying on the usual AA battery for power, this wireless mouse contains a non-replaceable gold double-layer ultracapacitor inside its sealed body that gets fully recharged within an astoundingly fast three or four minutes whenever I connect the included USB recharging cable, after which I can usually work constantly on the computer for at least 3-4 more hours before I need to recharge the mouse again. By comparison, the quickest that I can ever recharge AA rechargeable batteries going from being totally drained to being 100% charged is about one hour. This gives new meaning to the term \"\"turbo-charge\"\"! :-) Instead of the chemical reaction that is used by conventional batteries to provide power, gold capacitors rely on a storage cell that utilizes the absorption and release of ions.At the time of this review's writing, I have been using this mouse every day for the past three months in conjunction with theLogitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750, which is also wireless and battery-free by virtue of being solar-powered. Prior to using this mouse, I have mainly been using several high-quality Logitech and Microsoft wireless battery-powered mice. Since Logitech does not make a solar-powered mouse to match its solar-powered keyboard, and Genius does not make a battery-free keyboard to match its battery-free mouse, this combination of the Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 and this Genius battery-free mouse would make a nice gift bundle for a Toyota-Prius-driving environmentally-conscious friend :) (as long as you realize that this mouse is not perfect in its design... more about that later...)What is in the box package?&#10037; DX-EDO mouse&#10037; USB pico receiver&#10037; Micro-USB-to-USB mouse-recharging cable&#10037; Mouse driver and \"\"ioCentre\"\" software mini-CD (for Windows 7/Vista/XP and Mac OSX 10.4 or later)&#10037; 54-page 27-language \"\"User Manual\"\"The Genius DX-ECO mouse's product features are described and rated below:&#9658; Packaging, Style, Appearance: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; This product is nicely packaged in a clear flexible plastic case. The 54-page User Manual is misleading due to the whopping 27 different languages that it includes. Most user/owner manuals are printed in less than one third of the number of languages that are included here. For each of the 27 languages, the \"\"Hardware Installation\"\", \"\"Software Installation\"\", and \"\"Troubleshooting\"\" instructions only need two pages printed on a small pocket-sized sheet. The English-language two-page instructions are at the front and a \"\"Table of Contents\"\" lists page numbers for the other 26 languages. But there was no warranty information either in the User Manual or on the package's liner notes. Some descriptions of this product that have been posted on the Internet mention a 3-year warranty, but on KYE System's own geniuseshop.com Web site, it mentioned a 1-year warranty for all of their computer peripherals, along with a Return Merchandise Authorization phone number for their Americas headquarters located in Doral, Florida.The User Manual states that the mouse fully charges up after around five minutes of being plugged into a USB port, but from my usage, it always seems to fully charge up within three to four minutes. There is one potentially confusing statement that is mentioned in the User Manual: \"\"If you feel the mouse does not move smooth as usual, it is possible the batteries have lost their charge so you need to replace them. Remember to put the batteries in the correct direction.\"\" Perhaps this statement, located in the \"\"Troubleshooting\"\" section, was directly copied from other battery-operated Genius-brand mice, but since this mouse does not use batteries, this statement should not have been included in the User Manual because it can confuse people.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The package includes a mini-CD that contains extra mouse driver and \"\"ioCentre\"\" software. You do not need to install the included software on your computer in order to use this mouse. On both my Windows 7 and Windows Vista laptops, just plugging the USB pico receiver into the laptop caused Windows to configure its own mouse driver installation, and you can use this mouse just fine without installing the included software mini-CD. Without using the included mouse driver and software, a button on top of the mouse allows you to toggle between an 800-DPI or 1600-DPI mouse sensitivity setting that increases or decreases the speed of the mouse. Even though you can fine-tune the mouse's speed if you install the included software, it would have been nice if this mouse also included a 1200-DPI setting for people who may think that the slow setting is too slow and the fast setting is too fast.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; As mentioned, you do not need to install the supplied software on your computer. However, if you do install the software, it adds its own mouse driver and a \"\"ioCentre\"\" software that is similar to Logitech's SetPoint or Microsoft's IntelliPoint in that \"\"ioCentre\"\" lets me customize the mouse behavior and buttons. After installation of the supplied software, a little red arrow, representing the Genius logo, is displayed on the Windows Taskbar. Clicking on this logo displays a \"\"Genius\"\" mouse configuration window where I can customize the function of the middle (wheel) click, the two side buttons (which default to 'Back' and 'Forward' browser operations), and a \"\"Flying Scroll\"\" small square button on top of the mouse. By default, the Flying Scroll button on top of the mouse allows for quick scrolling and browsing of documents, but using the ioCentre software, I can customize this button to perform other useful functions instead. The Flying Scroll button lets me continuously scroll within any application; if I keep this button pressed down, I can continuously scroll as I move the mouse up and down and I can continuously pan as I move the mouse left and right, which can be useful for navigating around large spreadsheets or Web pages. The main left and right mouse buttons cannot be customized from their default left/right click functions. I can also customize 'Double Click Speed', 'Mouse Speed', 'Enhanced Pointer Position', 'Automatically move pointer to default button in dialog box', 'Display pointer trails', 'Vertical Scrolling', and 'Horizontal Scrolling' functions of the mouse.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Like Logitech's SetPoint software that interacts with other Logitech mice and keyboards, this \"\"ioCentre\"\" seems to be able to configure and interact with other Genius-brand mice and keyboards. I also have Logitech SetPoint installed on my Windows 7 and Windows Vista laptops, but SetPoint did not recognize this mouse. The ioCentre lets me customize the middle-wheel click, two side buttons, and flying scroll button to perform other various actions such as copy/cut the selected text to the clipboard, zoom/magnify, print the current document, change or mute the computer's volume, create/reply/forward an email message, interact with my instant messaging program, or trigger a variety of Windows or Windows Explorer functions. The ioCentre has a \"\"Skin\"\" option that lets me change its appearance between purple, red, and blue color themes, along with other visual customizations, and like the 27-language User Manual, the ioCentre can be displayed in 27 different languages. So in some respects, this ioCentre is more flexible overall than either Logitech's SetPoint or Microsoft's IntelliPoint. But as with Logitech's and Microsoft's software only working with their respective brands of mice and keyboards, ioCentre only works with Genius-brand mice and keyboards.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Another useful function of the ioCentre software is that it also displays a little battery logo on the Windows Taskbar, alongside the red-arrow Genius logo. If I hover my mouse over the battery logo, it will display the amount of power that is currently left in the mouse, e.g. \"\"KYE Device Power: 73%\"\". With a fully-charged mouse, the battery icon displays solid green, and then as the power is slowly used up, the green level on the icon slowly descends like a thermometer reading.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; During the last ten to twenty minutes of available power left in the mouse, a little red warning LED located on top of the mouse briefly flashes whenever I move the mouse, and the battery icon on the Windows Taskbar shows a low level that has changed from green to red. Hovering the mouse over the Taskbar's battery icon will likewise display a \"\"KYE Device Power Low: 1%\"\" message. But because both of these low-power warnings require me to specifically look down at the mouse's little LED or at the Taskbar's battery icon, it would have been a much better design if a low-power warning message could pop up prominently right onto my desktop to make it more obvious to me that my mouse is about to run out of power. This is how Logitech's SetPoint software warns the user when its mouse battery level is critically low.When installed on Windows, the \"\"ioCentre\"\" software that adds an entry to the Windows registry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:SOFTWARE:Microsoft:Windows:CurrentVersion:Run to automatically start four processes: gIoCentreFunMgm.exe, gKbdTask.exe, gMouseTask.exe, and gTaskBar.exe. I suspect that this combination of four processes does more things that just interact with this one mouse product, and it probably works with the various other Genius-branded mice, keyboards, and gaming products. From the Windows Task Manager, the approximate memory usage of these four processes on a Windows 7 system are as follows:gTaskBar.exe : 6190KgMouseTask.exe : 8060KgKbdTask.exe : 7340KgIoCentreFunMgm.exe : 11590KThe sum total memory usage of all four processes is quite a bit higher than the 13K of memory that Logitech's SetPoint software uses on my computer:SetPoint.exe : 13840KBut to use the ioCentre software with this mouse, the gIoCentreFunMgm process is not even needed. I have no idea what gIoCentreFunMgm.exe is, but the process name alone sounds like it is for use with other Genius-brand gaming peripherals. So I just renamed the gIoCentreFunMgm.exe file from the C:\\Genius\\ folder where the ioCentre software is installed, and now this process no longer starts up:C:\\Genius\\ioCentre\\ :53248 Mar 12 2010 gIoCentreFunMgm_SAVE.exe425984 Aug 4 2011 gKbdTask.exe679936 Aug 5 2011 gMouseTask.exe61440 Sep 3 2009 gTaskBar.exeDespite the \"\"gKbdTask.exe\"\" file name making it sound as if it only interacts with keyboard functions, this \"\"gKbdTask.exe\"\" process is needed to display the mouse's battery level icon on the Windows Taskbar. If you do not care about this battery icon and you just want to use the main ioCentre software to configure and customize the mouse's buttons and behavior, you can also rename or delete this gKbdTask file also so that only the gTaskBar.exe and gMouseTask.exe processes automatically start up on your Windows session each time. As mentioned, you do not need to install this ioCentre software to use this mouse, but the software lets you customize your mouse much more than just using its buttons in their default configurations.&#9658; Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies rating:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; This mouse has a sculpted ergonomic shape that feels good when I place my right hand onto it. Because it is specifically molded for use by the right hand, it unfortunately cannot be used in the left hand. The thumb grip area is lined with a grippy rubber surface that feels very nice. What prevents me from giving this mouse shape a full 5-star rating is that the mouse is slightly on the large size for my medium-sized hand. If you have very large hands, this mouse will fit even better inside your right hand. But if you have small hands, you may find this mouse to feel quite bulky underneath your right hand. But at least the mouse feels very light in weight for its size (3.5 ounces), no doubt also lightened by not having to hold a AA battery inside it, so it easily glides effortlessly across a surface.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The mouse's so-called BlueEye technology works very well to allow for sufficiently precise mouse tracking when I move the mouse across carpet, tile, frosted glass, sofas, pillows, or my lap while sitting at an airport either wearing blue jeans or shorts. This all-terrain mouse is comparable to Microsoft mice that use their \"\"BlueTrack\"\" technology or the Logitech \"\"Anywhere Mouse MX\"\". While the mouse performed admirably on a frosted glass surface, it did have problems tracking across a clear glass table; but my Microsoft \"\"BlueTrack\"\" mouse also has problems on a clear glass surface.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The mouse's center scroll wheel rotates with an incremental, notched/bumpy, \"\"cogwheel\"\" rolling effect that I prefer much more than the totally smooth continuous rolling scroll wheels that are used on some models of Microsoft and Logitech mice. As I move my finger over the center scroll feel, I like the tactile feedback of this kind of notched scroll wheel more than a mouse wheel that rotates and scrolls too smoothly. The mouse wheel is coated with a rubbery coating for better grip. I have both Logitech and Microsoft wireless mice where their scroll wheels do not rotate across notched stops and their wheels feel slippery as I roll my finger over them. So the center scroll wheel on this mouse feels very nice to me. However, this is just personal preference, and your mileage may vary. To press down on the center mouse wheel requires a medium force, not too soft and not too firm. By comparison, my Microsoft mice require a bit more finger pressure in order to click downward on the center scroll wheel. Clicking the left and right mouse buttons also requires a medium firmness of finger pressure that is comparable to other mice, and they have a nice crisp clicky feeling to them.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; As with many modern wireless mice, the USB pico receiver of this mouse uses a 2.4 GHz anti-interference wireless transceiver for a reliable connection range out to 40 or 50 feet.&#9658; Design & Features: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; After the mouse's capacitor has exhausted its power and I plug the Micro-USB-to-USB charging cable into my laptop, the small LED on top of the mouse glows red while the mouse charges up. After an extremely quick three to four minutes of charge time, the red LED is no longer lit up, meaning that the mouse is back again at 100% charge. But herein lies this mouse's most annoying weakness: depending upon how intensively you use your mouse, each recharge will probably last between three hours to five hours for most computer users. The underside of the mouse has a \"\"BlueEye\"\" light that only uses a tiny fraction of the mouse's stored energy. The bulk of the mouse capacitor's stored energy is used to transmit mouse movement information to its USB pico receiver. Just leaving the mouse turned on and not moving it around only uses a tiny amount of the mouse's stored charge.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; If you are constantly moving the mouse around during extended hours of Web surfing or for mouse-intensive applications like graphics editing or video games, you may experience mouse \"\"voltus interruptus\"\" after every three to four hours of use. This is not a good gaming mouse for hard-core gamers because it lacks the flashiness and configurability that most gamers demand, and because you would not want to have the mouse run out of charge while you are right in the middle of an extended gaming session. If your computer work involves much more typing and less mouse movement (e.g. you are a writer, journalist, or software developer), you may get at least five hours of use in between each charge. And if you are a light computer user who mainly uses the mouse to check your emails once a day, you may only have to recharge the mouse after several days of usage. But if you are going to use this mouse at your office for eight to ten hours a day, you will need to recharge it once or twice every day. This means that you will always need to keep the included Micro-USB-to-USB charging cable within reach, and every time that you pack this mouse with your laptop, you will need to include the recharging cable. This may be less of an issue if you have other devices that can also use this same Micro-USB-to-USB cable; for example, some cell phones also can use this same Micro-USB-to-USB cable for recharging. When I travel with my Logitech or Microsoft mouse and laptop, I normally pack one or two extra AA batteries just in case the mouse battery runs out of energy, so in terms of bulk, carrying the recharging cable in my laptop bag is no worse than carrying one or two spare batteries with me.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; After this mouse has run out of power and you need to use the recharging cable to plug the mouse into a USB port again, you can still continue to use the mouse while it is recharging. After fully exhausting all of its stored power, this mouse charges so quickly that the moment you plug the mouse into a USB source, it immediately becomes available for use again. But in order to continue using the mouse as if it was a regular wired mouse while it is charging up during those three or four minutes of charge time, you will need to use two USB ports, one for the USB pico receiver and one for the recharging cable. This may not be an issue for you if you have adequate free USB ports or if you have a USB hub. But this mouse design could have been much better if the mouse could be recharged through the single USB port being used by the pico receiver, either by utilizing a pass-through USB approach or perhaps some kind of inductive charging method, which is how some devices charge up electric toothbrushes and cell phones without requiring a direct electrical contact. Or it would be cool for KYE Systems to design an inductive-charging mouse pad so this mouse would not need to occupy a second USB port during recharging. It would also be nice if KYE Systems offered a Bluetooth version of this mouse, so that the only time a single USB port would be needed is during the 4-minute mouse recharging period. But there are far more USB wireless mice on the market right now than Bluetooth mice simply because not all laptops have built-in Bluetooth capability.&#9658; Construction & Build Quality: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Most USB pico receivers and nano receivers that are shipped with wireless mice are no larger than a USB connector. What is odd about the construction of this mouse's USB pico receiver is that its electrical contacts are not encased in an external metal housing, and this exposed circuitry makes it more susceptible to being damaged. I do not understand why the USB pico receiver was designed this way, but I have never seen a USB connector where the electrical contacts are exposed like this.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Overall, this mouse feels quite solid while I am using the mouse. But when I either plug the recharging cable into the Micro-USB port at the front of the mouse, use my finger to slide the On/Off switch underneath the mouse, or remove the top cover of the mouse to store the USB pico receiver, I get the feeling that this mouse is not as solidly and sturdily built as my Microsoft and Logitech mice. When press the Micro-USB connector into the Micro-USB port that is located at the front of the mouse, sometimes I can feel a slight bit of flex in Micro-USB port, as if I might push the Micro-USB port inward into the interior of the mouse if I, one day, use too much force.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The On/Off switch is mounted very flush against the underside of the mouse, leaving no room for the skin on my finger to get a grip on the plastic switch to slide it between the \"\"on\"\" and \"\"off\"\" positions. Because this On/Off switch is mounted so flush against the bottom panel of the mouse, I usually have to rake my fingernail onto the five tiny ridges that go across the small switch to slide it between the \"\"on\"\" and \"\"off\"\" positions. The underside of this mouse is roomy enough so that the manufacturer should have positioned this On/Off switch in the middle of a larger recessed cavity where I could pressed more of my finger onto the On/Off switch to slide it. As with plugging the recharging cable into the Micro-USB port, when I slide the On/Off switch back and forth, there is a bit of flex in the plastic and the switch gets pushed inward a little, leaving me to wonder if, after repeatedly sliding it back and forth, the On/Off switch may eventually be pushed into the interior of the mouse due to the softer plastic that used to house the switch.&#1150;&#1150; The rear of the mouse has a button that, when pushed, allows the curved piece of black-colored plastic that covers the top of the mouse to be removed. Once I remove the top cover on this mouse, inside is a slot where I can store the USB pico receiver. However, I think that this is a terrible design, and this is the one aspect of this mouse that I would rate at only 2 stars for two reasons. One reason that I really hate having to store the USB pico receiver inside interior of the mouse is that even though the top cover quickly pops off after I press the button at the rear of the mouse, it requires a lot more time and careful attention to align the top cover and carefully snap it back into place. Just by trial and error, I realized that replacing the top cover back onto the mouse is a little easier if I keep the mouse's rear button squeezed down while I put the cover back on. But putting the top cover back onto the mouse still takes FAR more time compared to how quickly the top cover comes off. The second, and primary, reason that I hate this design is because underneath this removable top cover are two tiny flimsy plastic tabs that latch into the front of the mouse and these two tabs activate the left and right mouse clicks when you press the left and right sides of this top cover shell. These two little plastic tabs are flimsy enough that I wonder if they will snap off after I have, over time, repeatedly removed and replaced the top cover for the purpose of storing the USB pico receiver. And if the these plastic tabs snap off, this essentially renders the mouse useless because the left and right button clicks will then no longer work!!! So I now store this mouse's USB pico receiver in a spare 35mm film canister; I have many 35mm film canisters from my previous years of 35mm film photography. Now, instead of removing/storing the USB pico receiver from/to the cumbersome interior of the mouse, I can just quickly retrieve it from the 35mm film canister. I also use a small rubber band to bundle up the mouse's USB recharging cable and secure it to the side of this 35mm film canister so both items get carried together. On my Microsoft and Logitech mice, the USB receiver/transmitter is stored sideways or vertically in a slot that is molded into the underside of the mice. The underside of this Genius mouse is large enough so that the manufacturer could have ideally designed a storage slot underneath this mouse so that removing the USB pico receiver from the storage slot underneath the mouse would automatically also turn the mouse on and placing the USB pico receiver back into the storage slot would automatically turn off the mouse.&#9658; Performance, Durability, Reliability: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating:Even though I mentioned above that the construction and build quality of this mouse is slightly subpar when I compare it to my Microsoft and Logitech wireless mice in the $40 to $50 price range, it has been flawlessly operating for me after three months of heavy constant daily use. This product claims that the mouse can be recharged \"\"approximately 100,000 times\"\". Even if I constantly use this mouse every day, seven days a week, from early morning until bedtime, which would require five charges per day for about 18 hours of constant daily computer usage (an unlikely scenario), 100,000 recharges translates to 20,000 days of intensive mouse usage, or a hardware lifespan of almost 55 years. Even with my best Logitech and Microsoft mice, I find that they all eventually fail within eight years time due to either the tracking mechanism failing or the left/right mouse buttons wearing out due to mechanical failure or failure of the internal electrical contacts. So I have no doubt that even if this mouse's ultracapacitor could last for 55 years of recharges, its other mechanical components will likely fail within ten years anyway. I also presume that the gold ultracapacitor that is used inside this mouse is not susceptible to the \"\"memory effect\"\" that caused earlier designs of nickel cadmium rechargeable batteries to progressively store less and less charge if they were repeatedly recharged after being only partially discharged.&#9658; Competitive Pricing & Value: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies rating:If you can purchase this mouse for less than $40, I think that this is a pretty good deal, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon had this priced at less than $40. A prime determinant of what you think of this mouse may depend upon how you feel about its need to be recharged two times a day if you use it all day at the office, or three times a day if you use the mouse both during the day and night.&#3051; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:At the time of this review's writing, the Genius company only has this mouse as the only battery-free mouse in their product line filled with other mice and keyboards, and there is no similar DX-ECO keyboard. If they do eventually manufacture a matching DX-ECO battery-free keyboard, I hope that they are able to double or triple the amount of charge that can be retained by the capacitors after each full charge.Many wireless computer mice can run for months using a single AA battery. You can be more environmentally green if you use rechargeable AA batteries when using battery-powered wireless mice. Right now, this Genius mouse is the only capacitor-charged mouse on the market, but I would not be surprised if Logitech, Microsoft, and others are looking at this Genius design. Until a better battery-free mouse comes along, if you do decide to purchase this mouse, just realize that your are trading the convenience of using a regular AA-battery-powered mouse for this greener solution that requires no batteries, but requires one, two, or maybe three quick charges during each day and night of frequent mouse usage.Many people do not realize the long-term toxic consequences of casually throwing away spent batteries in their garbage cans, but thousands of dry cell batteries get dumped into landfills every year and, over time, all of these countless batteries can leach their toxic heavy metals into the soil, groundwater, surface water, lakes, and streams. Every year, hundreds of tons of batteries are discarded in the U.S., and most people still do not think about recycling batteries. Part of the problem with recycling batteries is that finding a convenient drop-off location to properly recycle and dispose of batteries is still hard to do in most cities; even in large cities, it can be difficult to find a place that accepts old batteries for proper disposal and recycling. Most cities do not foster enough public awareness of the long-term environmental impact caused by thousands of people throwing away electronic waste such as batteries, computers and display monitors, cell phones, and other electronics which are loaded with heavy metals, plastics, and other toxic substances that can slowly work their way into the ecosystem and into the food chain. So despite this product's annoying requirement of recharging after every four hours of usage, any electronic item that does not add to the amount of toxic electronic waste accumulating in landfills is a step in the right direction. There is a huge potential for this kind of capacitor-based design to be applied to other wireless mice and wireless keyboards. With most wireless mice, computer users are using four to six new AA batteries every year, many people do not use rechargeable batteries, most people do not bring their spent batteries to be properly recycled, and all those batteries just get tossed into the trash can.I think that the design of this mouse could be improved a great deal if its charging capacity was doubled or tripled so that each recharging would provide enough power for eight to ten hours of constant mouse usage. Even if this required eight to ten minutes of charge time to fully charge a totally drained mouse, instead of the current three to four minutes of charge time, users would find it less intrusive to charge up the mouse at the start of their work day, using it as a conventional wired mouse while it is plugged into the USB port for ten minutes, and then have its power last into the evening hours, instead of having to recharge the mouse two or three times during each day.Even though it only takes three or four minutes to fully charge up this mouse to 100% power again, this mouse's proclivity to \"\"voltus interruptus\"\" after three to five hours of constant usage may be a big enough of an annoyance to be a total deal-breaker for you. On my other Microsoft and Logitech wireless mice, a single new AA battery, or a freshly charged AA rechargeable battery, can power the mouse for several months of daily heavy usage. By using this mouse, even though you no longer need to replace batteries, you have to consider for yourself whether the merits of going battery-free outweigh the inconvenience of plugging the mouse into a USB port to recharge it two or three times a day. But I am enjoying the use of this mouse, and both for the past three months and for the foreseeable future, I have set aside my other Microsoft and Logitech mice as I am solely using this mouse whenever I work on my two laptops now (my two desktop computers still use a Microsoft wired mouse).I would have happily rated this mouse at 5 stars if its charging capacity was increased so that I could use it for an entire work day without needing to recharge two or three times, and if its USB pico receiver was designed to be stored underneath the mouse, instead of inside the mouse.\"", "\"The basic usage of this mouse is alright, but definitely doesn't include anything that can't be found in other wireless mice in the same price range.  My primary problem with this mouse has been the \"\"battery-free\"\" technology.  While this is billed as a convenience, since you won't have to change batteries, in fact, it makes the use of this mouse much more tedious than any others I have owned.  The mouse will only run for a few hours before needing to be recharged.  Yes, it does charge quickly.  However, in order to accommodate this, you will have to bring the cable with you at all times and frequently pause your work to charge the mouse.  Compared to my Logitech wireless mouse, which only needs a battery change 2-3 times a year, this is pretty ridiculous.  I might as well use a wired mouse if I have to plug it in that frequently.  Unless you are really convinced that the extra hassle is worth saving 4-6 batteries per year, just skip this one.\"", "This is a decent mouse, I guess. It's almost great, but has one fairly glaring annoyance.PROS:+ good ergonomics, if you're a right-handed mouse user (I am)+ plug and play. Just pop in the receiver and you're good. I didn't bother installing any of the software.+ rapid chargingCONS:- lightweight, sort of feels flimsy- battery life... see below:BATTERY LIFE: so, I know this is being billed as an 'ECO-Friendly' mouse. They're excited that their mouse has a capacitor instead of conventional batteries. Well, they should have doubled the capacitor size, because the short battery life (a little over half the workday with moderate use) hurts this mouse. If you've got to plug the mouse in multiple times throughout the day, it loses the value of a 'cordless' mouse, which is not having to use a cord. My other mouse at work,Logitech Wireless Mouse M325 with Designed-For-Web Scrolling - Dark Silver (910-002136), is loaded with Sanyo Eneloop batteries and lasts for MONTHS, and when it's about to run out I just pop in some new rechargeable batteries and am good to go for months.This is a minor annoyance until you think about using a laptop somewhere other that at a desk / dock. You have to bring the mouse cord with you anytime you travel or are using your laptop at the couch, outside, etc. Why not just use a corded mouse, then, and skip the cord + receiver accessories? You're dealing with three different components, and losing one of those three = no mouse.How much more 'ECO-Friendly' is this mouse? The only difference is a capacitor + cord vs. rechargeable batteries. Seems more like a marketing gimmick to me.", "A battery free wireless mouse sounds like a wonderful concept but is it really in this day and age?  I will have to say no, and it's a shame because this mouse would've been at the top of the charts had it come out, say, five years ago.Instead of a battery, this unit uses a capacitor which requires approx 5 minutes to charge.  Seems fairly easy enough, but how long does a charge last?  The manufacturer claims 4 hours; I got about 3 hours of web surfing with it.  That's not long enough at all and is very frustrating to have this thing run out of juice in the middle of a session then have to plug it in.  Even if it's only 5 minutes to charge up, you still have to plug the thing in. That means for someone lounging around and/or using for productivity work may have to charge this more than once a day.  Not cool.  Certainly not when compared to the Logitech wireless mice which, using just a single AA, lasts for MONTHS.  The double AA Logitech unit I have lasts for nearly a YEAR without any need to change the battery (which is only a regular AA I might add)The unit uses its own proprietary wireless connector; it's NOT bluetooth and not compatible with anything else out there.  If you have a logitech, they all use the standardized unifying adapter.  This means a lot because you have to dedicate an entire USB port to fit the adapter.  It only adds to clutter and some of us have no free USB port to spare.Since you plug it in to your USB to charge, you might think that this can work as a regular corded mouse that way, right?  NOPE.  There is no intelligence in the port on the mouse; it merely takes power.  Can't use it as a corded by-pass mouse.  LAME!Further, build construction is only average, not great.  Felt plasticky and cheap.  It's not exactly lightweight either, so hardly any props for travel concerns.Then when I look at the price, I see it's expensive and not competitively priced.  Really, I find nothing great about this mouse; spend the money on a wireless logitech instead.  Who the heck wants to keep plugging and unplugging this thing just for 3 hours of juice?  The mouse has become a torture device for me, causing me to do nothing but curse at it.", "the mouse is big enough and really charges in 3 minutes how ever if you fail to do it on daily basis the battery will die on the 2nd or 3rd day.", "It certainly does what it says. Plug it into your computer for three minutes. It will then work for quite a while, at least three hours. The charge even lasts after a week. Works on most surfaces: carpet, plastic table, sofa.The on/off button is a little stiff. It's lighter than most mice, probably because it has a capacitor instead of a battery.If you don't want to have to worry about batteries, this is it. That's the reason this mouse exists, and that's the reason you'll buy it (or not). Although you'll be charging it somehow anyway, supposedly up to 100,000 times. You'll have to decide if it's worth $50.", "\"I have used computer mice for 37 years (not a typo), so I could not resist trying out this new battery-less wireless mouse.Pros -* Buttons work quite well, with positive clicks* Tracks well on all surfaces I tried* Scroll wheel is one of the better ones* Includes storage for nano receiver* Wireless transmission error-free in my room* Browser back & forward buttons work well(All the above without the included software installed, I never install mouse software and so review all of them the same way.  In this case, the mouse worked just fine without the software on Windows Vista.)Cons -* Shape has some ergonomic problems.  While the shelf to rest your thumb is a plus, the right side of the body sticks out too far and tends to press into your palm.  (Of course, this depends on your hand size - I have slightly larger than average hands, but guys with huge hands will have no problem - and this is probably too large a mouse for people with smaller hands.)* While the price is equal to or greater than the M510 which is currently my everyday mouse, the DX-ECO uses a little cheaper quality plastic and materials.  The switch in particular seems cheap, and is somewhat difficult to move. (IMHO, this factor is balanced out by the positive working of the buttons and scrolling - I would rather have a mouse that works well, rather than one this is made well but performs poorly.)Battery-free feature -The above is the review of it as a full-size wireless mouse, where it does just fine, subject to your personal feelings about the fit and materials.But the unique feature is the use of a built-in permanent capacitor rather than a battery. You see this sometimes in AC-powered products like clock-radios that have a capacitor that provides \"\"battery backup for power failures\"\" without needing a battery.This has advantages and disadvantages for computer mice.  You have to charge the power source.  Normally, you either use low-discharge NIMH rechargeable batteries (such as \"\"Eneloops\"\") or disposable ones.  Current low-power transmitters allow months of use for recent wireless mouse products, so it is not a big factor.  My M510 uses two AAs, and eneloops would last for years, so add five dollars to the price and it is still roughly equivlaent to the DX-ECO in price.  Of course, that does imply that you own and use a battery charger.The DX-ECO comes with a charging cord that looks like a USB-to-mini-USB cable (assuming it does not have some unique internal difference).  So, you can charge it in 3-4 minutes from any PC or laptop with a USB port.  At first that seems fast - a trivial amount of time, BUT if you need to do something right now, like send an important email, or start a movie for a child, then it may be too much time (although it is actually possible to use the mouse while it is charging, albeit that can be awkward depending on where you have to plug in the charging cable).  You can have a similar problem with a mouse with a dead battery, but that only happens once or twice a year, while this DX-ECO only works for a few hours, so it needs charging quite a bit.  (Note: I left the mouse sitting with the power on, after using it for about an hour, and it was still working after 24 hours, but then when I started using it, the power ran out after about another hour.  Another reviewer said it lasts for 4 hours of continual use.)So, this has two disadvantages over rechargeable batteries - 1) a charge lasts for a much shorter time and thus is a task that needs to be done frequently, and 2) the charger cord is an additional item that needs to be stored somewhere, and might easily get misplaced (or simply be unavailable when you need to charge - \"\"darn, I brought the mouse and nano receiver, but forgot the charger cable in the drawer!\"\")Unfortunately, the DX-ECO did not include some sort of charging dock to simply the process (which admittedly would be more expensive and less compact).  But I think that would be a good innovation for a mouse manufacturer to make available.  Sennheiser's excellent wireless RS180 headphones include Eneloop rechargeable batteries, and then just placing the headphones on the stand recharges those standard size batteries automatically every night - definitely the most convenient and trouble-free method.So, overall, this is a good product, but it may only be suitable for certain people or certain uses, as indicated above.UPDATE: Those mini-USB connectors seem to be difficult to insert (I have had a problem with them on more than one product), and you have to have the plug perfectly aligned and parallel for it to insert.  In this case, my reservations about the cheap brittle plastic used were justified, as the mini-USB jack for charging on the mouse has pushed into the mouse, so I can no longer charge the device.  Conclusion - when materials seem cheap, expect the device to break sooner rather than later.\"", "\"My review of this product is written from the perspective of someone who has medium sized hands and a current user of both theLogitech M510 Wireless MouseandMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 - Graphite.The mouse easily installed on a Windows 7 system (Dell Inspiron Desktop). What really drew my attention to this product, like many other reviewers, was the \"\"battery free\"\" aspect in that it would charge in under 5 minutes.  That is true.  The charging indicator indicated a full charge in about 4 minutes using the USB supplied dongle. The charge, with heavy use, lasts about 4 hours with the built in and permanent battery.On usability; the mouse is very lightweight. The build quality seems a little cheaper than my M510.  The size is a little big for my taste and definitely bigger than my M510.  The design itself is ergonomic with good tactile feedback, but as I said before, a little big for my taste.  I use the product for photo editing in Photoshop and Lightroom and its accuracy and sensitivity is good (it can be adjusted as well to 1600 DPI). I did have a minor issue with the scroll wheel in that it did not disengage as expected but I may just have to get used to it.The current price point of this product is high (in my opinion). This is offset by fact that you will not need to replace the batteries, a big plus.  Ultimately, I switched back to my daily mouse- the M510.\"", "\"Since we're constantly replacing batteries in our cordless mice, I was attracted to the battery-free aspect of this mouse, especially since it claims to charge up in only 4 minutes. I didn't believe that at first, so when I unpacked the mouse (it comes with a USB charging cable and a USB dongle) and hooked it up to the PC, I timed it with a timer, and the charging light went out in just under 4 minutes! I then unplugged the cable, plugged in the dongle, switched the mouse on and it was ready to use immediately, no driver necessary (our PC has Windows XP).The size and shape of this mouse is perfect for my adult hands. It's contoured, but not as huge as the contoured Logitech mouse I had been using, thus my wrist rests comfortably on the desk instead of floating above it. The mouse moves very smoothly on either a cloth mouse pad or the bare desk. It has handy next/previous thumb buttons, a scroll wheel that clicks rather than rolling freely, and buttons that aren't too sensitive - I can \"\"rest\"\" my fingers on them without clicking by accident.  No batteries makes it lightweight, and you can pop the top off and store the dongle inside for traveling. (Thanks to the other reviewer, otherwise I would not have known that!)Marvelous mouse so far; I hope it lasts.\"", "Still using this months several months later and I love it.1. I got roughly four plus hours of solid use from charging three to five minutes.2. The lightweight feel, which typically bothers me and makes me perceive the item as cheap, wasn't a consideration as I use this mouse for my traveling laptop and the less weight -- the better.3. I didn't have to install any software or download anything from the internet. I just plugged it in and started using it.4. The mouse uses a capacitor versus a battery for keeping powered. Works just fine. Great adjustment in tech.5. Like other mice, it works on most surfaces and has very little issue / problem on multi-colored tables.6. Button operation is good and the scroll wheel is what you would expect.I can find no real downsides with this. If having to charge this for a few minutes a day is bothersome, I would likely suggest another product as this is definitely for someone considering purchasing a mouse for traveling or in an environment where batteries might either be inaccessible or not an option."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.023575901985168457, 0.5368369221687317, 0.04343811050057411, 0.01483180932700634, 0.011846424080431461, 0.029850993305444717, 0.0032893226016312838, 0.003045107005164027, 0.10494668036699295, 0.22833876311779022]]}
