It is our goal to make sure you have all the resources you need to get the most from your product.I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please be informed that the flash drives are the plug and play storage devices. In mid-2013 SanDisk changed production of Cruzer USB Drives to show up as fixed disk to meet a requirement for Windows 8 certification. At the end of 2013, SanDisk reverted back to producing Cruzer USB Drives as removable disk. There is no tool available to change SanDisk Cruzer USB Drives between fixed and removable disk configuration. SanDisk Cruzer USB Drives in removable disk configuration will be available again shortly in retail outlets.Also, Please be informed that Flash drives configured as fixed disks still function the same as those configured as removable disk but unfortunately it may not be recognized by the multiple software's on the computer that can only recognize the external drive as a removable disk.Please reply to this email for any further queries and i will be glad to assist you further.Please refer to your My SanDisk at [...].com anytime to see all of your incident history and product registration information.

The problem is that the drive is recognized, but just won't function properly as a removeable usb flash drive.  Problem seems to affect only windows 8/8.1 computers as they work fine in windows 7.Hope this helps someone.", "We ordered a number of these in order to transfer a large amount of files to some clients.  No cheaper and better way to physically hand someone 128GB of data.

I have my many years of photos safely stored on this one with little room to spare.", "I used this to backup a Google Drive account; basically had all my files for years, and just as a little extra protection, bought this to double-cover my butt.", "These sandisk usb drives are nice and cheap. They hold alot for what you pay, and they are nice and big (harder to lose). They are great if you want to back up your music library and so. My biggest complaint is the transfer speed, as it makes you wait while moving around gigs of files.", "I have been using it for about a mongh and it works fine. It transports data from my office to my house and vica versa every day.", "I use these for backup. Sure they aren't lightning fast, but I don't really care. I start to copy to the Drive and can go about my life. I think that one I loaded said that it was going to take 9 hours to load the two files. The two files were about 110 GB combined. That's a whole bunch of images. It took all day.The issue for me is that they hold all that data reliably. I can catalog them and store them way more reliably than an HD. HD's freeze up if you don't use them and, well, y'all know how well the last when they are left on. We used them because they were the only game in town. Now we all have something better.I did take off one star because they are not lightning fast, but as mentioned above &#34;I don't really care&#34;.", "huge jump for videos and music when my 128gb ssd needs a little relief. have had no issues and speed is good enough for me", "I take this baby with me everywhere!

It does not snap into the retracted position firmly.Also I tried the included Sandisk secure vault software and did not care for the way it operates.  Used a freeware encryption product instead.", "The drive itself is fine. It is 64GB at a decent price, but there are a few things to consider.1. The device cannot be formatted by Windows. When you plug it in Windows thinks it is 48MB and won't format it to the full 64GB. You have to download a third party application such as HP Disk Utility to format it to its full size. With a Mac it is plug and play. It's not a big deal, but at the time I didn't have internet and had a fun time trying to acquire a program to format the thing.2. It is incredibly slow. There are a lot of factors that contribute to this, but I have used it on Mac OS X, Windows XP and 7, and Chrome OS. Chrome tends to be the fastest at moving data and on other flash drives (even SanDisk Flash Drives) I can move 3 or 4 GBs of data in a negligible amount of time. With this drive, writing to it is a hassle and I usually have to find something else to do while I wait. Filling all 64GB would take a very, very long time.3. It looks sleek, but its awkward shape can cause some problems. I usually plug flash drives directly into my Apple keyboard. This drive feels like it is going to break when I put it in the keyboard and then the keyboard is lopsided. When I plug it into my TV it blocks the second USB port. Where I can usually fit two USBs, when I am using the Cruzer Glide I can only fit one. In my deck in my car the USB goes in a tray that pops out. When I go to close the tray the button catches the top and the tray needs to be closed so it is unusable in my car which is very disappointing because that is the main reason I bought it. I suppose it could be the design of the other products I am using that is to blame, but I expect that the Apple keyboard, the Samsung TV, and the Boss audio system were all tested with multiple flash drives and never had a problem so I put the blame on the Cruzer Glide. I do have just the regular SanDisk Cruzer and would recommend that over the Glide if you are going to get a SanDisk Cruzer.These are little things, but they definitely influence my decision when purchasing new flash drives.", "I've owned a lot of SanDisk flash drives over the years. In fact, the other day I came across the first 4GB SanDisk I ever owned. Back then and for years after, SanDisk used a small metal bar to anchor and O-ring or whatever mount you used - and this assemblage broke fairly easily on my first SanDisk. I learned my lesson and, apparently, years later, so has SanDisk. Now the mount is molded in the plastic. Hopefully it will be tougher.The physical design of the unit is a continuing evolution of the classic SanDisk slider. It's somewhat simplified and I have some concerns about the durability of the manufacture. It not only is all-plastic, but it feels plasticy. We shall see on how long this lasts.The slider itself moves smoothly and has a positive lock on the plug side. This is good.I remove all manufacturer software from hard drives, flash drives r any other computer storage device. Too many problems with that stuff over the years.I have 119GB available on my unit. Imagine that: 119GB in your pocket or purse. Unreal. I got mine on an Amazon Deal and my cost is about 50 cent7s per Gigabyte. Utterly mind-blowing.Read/write speeds are okay. I don't expect any flash drive to win speed awards.Am I satisfied? Absolutely. A great buy and an even greater buy if you can wait for it to go on sale.Jerry", "This is now my fourth SanDisk product so I'm thinking that make me a fan of SanDisk products.  I've come to trust the name and the reliability of what they offer on the market so I'm comfortable giving this product a solid rating.  As with other SanDisk products (or most others in general) this is a very easy to use USB flash drive.  I'm not an IT guy or a geek by any stretch of the imagination so I won't get into technical details or nitpicks that others may consider for their reviews.  To me this is a simple, ready-to-sue device that meets my expectations.  The USB connector slides (or would that be glides?) into its base via an easily accessed knob on the top.  The connector actually locks in place so to retract it requires a push on the knob.  This feature allows the user to insert into the computer slot without it retracting back into the device base.  There is also a loop connector on the Glide that will allow some type of key ring or other chain connector to be used if that makes it easier to transport it.  I've seen people (IT geeks, typically) who use these things as necklaces, but then it is easier to transport this way if putting it in a pocket is not an option.All in all, the price on larger size flash drives continues to drop.  Amazon naturally will be less than a retail store, but even over the counter big box purchases are quite reasonable compared to years past.  The Cruzer Glide stacks up well against any competition, and the SanDisk name is one that is familiar and reliable.", "In a USB 2.0 slot I compared the 128gb version of this drive with a Mushkin 64gb. Downloading 60gb to the Mushkin took a bit under an hour. It took almost 3, count 'em, 3 hours for the Glide. Now, granted, I won't be copying such huge amounts of data once I've established my primary backup, but, jeez Louise, this stinks.", "\"Needed this for my work-at-home job, and it seems to be doing the job just fine. I like that it doesn't have a \"\"cap\"\" as I always lose them. If there is a problem later, I will let you know, but so far so good, and that is what counts!\"", "i'm using it to backup movies right now. just remember to have a fan nearby so it won't get hot when backing up everything & take breaks.Of course if u want to use the Sandisk SecureAccess software just remember it's only the minimum bits encryption (feds would easily get through).", "This is excellent as usual. Size of the product is great! 128GB is very large capacity w. r. t. money!I strongly recommended this to others!", "I needed a flash drive to store all the original photos I have after I have edited them (the edited pics stay on the hard drive while the originals go on this flash drive).  This flash drive did the trick as I do have a vast amount of pics that are waiting to be edited.  It is a bit slow to &#34;refresh&#34;, though.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone needing a flash drive to store vast amounts of data on.", "Well, I cannot say anything about it because I misplaced it and haven't had an opportunity to use it. It looked fine and I'm sure it'll be OK.", "This drive was purchased to hold a Truecrypt encrypted file container.In Truecrypt, it just would not format successfully, using any file system, until the size of the container was set to a multiple of 512 (supposedly a block size used by Truecrypt (??).After 4 days of experimenting, I found that out, and got a successful format.A Truecrypt format takes about 4 hours when done by a powerful laptop (Thinkpad W520, hottest CPU).Now, all seems to work reliably. I believe that trouble was with Truecrypt and not this drive.I related this in case others wanted to use this drive in the same manner.Regular formatting seems normal.The drive seems a little slow, but so far, seems reliable. Transfer rates were similar to other posters.The indicator light is inside the drive, making it hard to see because of the slide mechanism covering the center portion.Mounting the light on top, at the end of the drive would have been much better.I like the storage capacity and the tip being protected when not in use.", "Not much more you can say about it except that it does what it is supposed to.  The size of this one is great.  I am a computer techie and I have been able to backup whole profiles on this device prior to performing maintenance on various PC's with this mass storage device.", "Reads fast, writes fast. I like all the features and styling of this flash. It saved me on several occassions.  Not much to say but yea. Definitely worth looking at", "This has been a really good drive for a really good price. I use it all the time to move my files around.", "Has a bit of a cheap feel, but works with no problems. Maybe I'm jaded because I bought a 32 GB ruggedized device at the same time. No issues encountered at all, would purchase again.", "I recently got one of these as a gift.  Normally I don't like cap less design, preferring instead to use a capped one in a small, padded USB carrying case, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  However, using it reminds me why I don't like cap less designs.Overall, the device feels very cheaply constructed of very light weight plastic.  This isn't to say it's junk and it's going to break apart during normal use, just that it doesn't feel sturdy enough to be bouncing around in your pocket.  If you're careful with it, I'm sure it'll last quite a while, but I can't see trusting it on a keyring.  The slider was particularly annoying to me.  It didn't fail, but just sort of catches a little when trying to put it back in.  Not a deal breaker, but a little annoying.The computer does claim it's fast enough for ReadyBoost, so that's a plus.  I'm only using the 8 GB model, so it's not like I'm copying huge chunks of data.  Copying files didn't seem all that quick to me, but it wasn't super slow.  I didn't have any complaints at this price point.  Overall, just feels like a cheap, basic drive that will do what you need if you're careful with it.", "The best, reliable and fast memory I have seen. The red switch allows to hide the connector and protect more this drive.", "SanDisk makes/sales some good products and this is one of them. It has lots of room for storing or transferring data and the USB plug pulls back in (I don't know way)."], "Gamma": [0.05262647196650505, 0.05262647196650505, 0.056713804602622986,
