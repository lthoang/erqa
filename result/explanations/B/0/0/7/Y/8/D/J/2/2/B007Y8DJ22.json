So do I. My laptop is the Asus 53sw gaming one and is very fast. But, for web browsing the Chromebook is much preferred.Jean mostly web browsed, emailed, etc using a dual-core HP running Windows 7 and mostly Google applications - email, chrome browser, docs, etc. She transitioned to the Chromebook without a hiccup.The Chromebook is light, quiet (no fan noise) and very portable, cool (sets on lap without burning legs), fast, easily maintained with no worries about virsus, maleware, updates, maintenance, slow-downs with age, etc. Just exactly what she needs to be self sufficient (no help from me - ever. She finds that very liberating).The matte screen is sharp, bright and beautiful. It is easily usable outdoors. Videos look great on it.Sound is good and music sounds good on it. The volume could be a little greater but otherwise it sounds very good.The keyboard is very good and is preferred over my Asus.The matte touchpad is large, very responsive and easy to use. Again better than my Asus which is no slouch.The case doesn't show finger prints and is easy to clean. Browsing is top-notch and very fast and smooth. We have found no limitations to our browsing experience compared with our Windows 7 machines. In fact for browsing the Chromebook is better because it starts instantly (we don't turn it off) and there is no waiting around for it to \"\"wake up\"\".Hers has no problem with Wifi staying connected. It has been connected for 3 days now with no disconnects.I recommend this for anyone who is sick of the virsus's, maintenance problems, update aggravation of Windows 7, etc and who uses google applications such as Gmail, Chrome browser, etc.  If you like the idea of the Chromebook but don't use Google applications I recommend that you sign up for a Gmail account and try Google for awhile. If you like their applications then you are a canidate for the Chromebook. I actually prefer the Chromebook over a tablet when portability is not the ultimate goal.Update- After 20 days Chromebook developed the dreaded disconnect problem. A work around is to shutdown and cold start. Amazon will replace it but I don't have much hope that will fix it. At this point I don't recommend it at all. I would wait for the 3rd generation since neither Google nor Samsung seems able to fix the problem.Update #2 - Discovered wife's Chromebook disconnects only (when it sleeps) while on battery power. It does not ever disconnect while plugged in or while it is being used. When it disconnects either a cold start or a manual wireless reconnect fixes the problem until it disconnects again. Based on this information the problem is easily worked around in our situation. We just plug it in when not using it. Because of this flaw we dropped the rating by one star. Still useful to her even with the documented behavior.\"", "Love the Chromebook but my Verizon 3g won't activate.  Contacted Verizon, Samsung, and Amazon no one is any help.  Also waited a couple days like someone stated in a previous review, but no luck.  So I'm returning for a replacement with 3G that hopefully works.", "\"I've seen this beast in Best Buy, and wanted one.I craved it.  I have techno-greed for this machine.It's not so much needed; I have an Eee ep121 slate, a desktop, and so forth.Still, it would be an ideal solution for my Mom's use.She's in an area where wired internet is ridiculously expensive and therefore getting wifi means going elsewhere.Verizon, the provider selected by Google as of the time I write this review, might even have decent 3G in her area, though I prefer Sprint.  (Note that Verizon's been failing to keep up their side of the deal and there is no guarantee that Google will stay with them.)I would get this in a heartbeat except for one thing.  100 MB per MONTH is pretty much a slap in the face to anyone who wants to use this like a \"\"regular\"\" laptop computer, and the form factor is such that they WILL want to use it like a regular laptop computer.Even if you do nothing more than look at Facebook, view a few Youtube videos, listen to an hour of Pandora or another service -- you can easily burn through 100MB in a single day.Add to this the fact that anything you put on this machine, whether your own creation or something someone else sends you, is backed up to your \"\"cloud\"\" so it won't get lost.  This is a good thing, usually, though I would just as soon be able to have SOME things stay local. But uploading and synching is an additional overhead that eats even more precious bit-budget.So, until Google can make an arrangement with whoever, to ensure REAL broadband wireless at a price that even a retiree on a fixed budget can afford, even if it isn't free for two years, it won't meet the needs of a pretty large potential customer base.\"", "\"First, you need to understand the ChromeOS and what it's all about.  I won't cover that here except to say it's pretty nifty if you know what you want and that happens to be a secure environment for working online in \"\"the cloud\"\" (but still like to have the capability of occasional local music, videos, and such for casual viewing).  My main focus in this review is on the hardware and that is because the Samsung Series 5 550 is, currently, about the best of the lot for the price and especially so if you can find a good, used item at a lower price.  At $579, I think it's not a great value, but at around 300-350 it becomes a better deal.The 550 is well made, looks very nice, and has the best performance of any of the ChromeBooks available at the moment (excluding the new Google Pixel model which is still an unknown to me at this point[Update the Google Pixel is at least twice as fast - but also twice the cost. But it is sweet!]).  I have several of the first Acer models which I got for around $200 and I have been very happy with them.  But occasionally, they lack sufficient power (streaming HD videos, for example).  So when I had a chance to pick up one of these used at around $330, I went for it (and glad I did!).The screen is about the same, Acer's are a little better, but the color is good.  Contrast ratio is average (i.e. poor!).  Viewing angles are poor/average as usual, unfortunately, but on a small screen like this, you can get by.  The screen is quite fine for web browsing, email and such, but not so fine for movies (acceptable but not good at all if you're used to better quality displays). The speakers, however, are better than average for a small laptop like this and actually good enough for casual movie watching.  Of course, you can always use external speakers for even better sound. (Update: Speakers have pretty good stereo separation and quality when listening to music.  Not much bass or power, but a nice clean sound. Better than average.)You get the usual 2 USB 2.0 ports, an SD card slot (as others have noted, the card sticks out a bit, not a deal killer, but something to be aware of).  You get Ethernet, DisplayPort, an 3.5 mm audio out (headphones level) and so on.  Nothing special except for the 4 GB RAM which is double what you get on most ChromeBooks and a welcome bonus. Very decent keyboard and touchpad. (Update: Keyboard and touchpad are very nice, much better than average.  Two fingered scrolling is very smooth.)As I use more of these devices, I've come to really appreciate the Google sync up that automatically syncs my setup and info over multiple devices.  And, of course, the instant on/off convenience of the ChromeOS.  Acer's low cost models are still the best value, in my opinion, but if you specifically need the higher performance (many will not), this is your only choice. (And this is definitely a nicer looking rig.)All in all, a very decent unit, and the fastest CPU currently available in a ChromeBook.  (Update: Except for this:Super Google Chromebook Pixel (WIFI) Touch Screen 12.85\"\" 2560x1700 3:2 LCD i5-3427U 4GB DDR3 32GB SSD 3.4lbs Ultraportable)  I enjoy using it very much.(Update: Super battery life with no drain. Came back after several weeks and still had a full 90% battery which was where it was when I turned it off.  Not a small thing in my opinion. Some notebooks are notorious for draining the battery even when \"\"off.\"\"}\"", "Very good web based laptop. i have had it for now over 2 years. Track pad wore out. But i got a lot of use out of it. I am now on a samsung chromebook 2 using the Octa-Core 11.6. Looking for the new i3 core version of the chromebook for better performance.", "People like their iPads, and I do get the Apple addiction. But the iPad, which is incredibly expensive, still won't play flash or really do a whole lot considering Apple is incessant about keeping their platform closed. The chromebook, however, is powered by Google Android, an open source platform, which makes the possibilities for usage much more boundless. Furthermore, it has an actual keyboard which is SUCH a relief from having to type on the iPad screen. Sure you could buy the iPad keyboard attachment, but if I so why not just get this in the first place?? It comes with top of the line firmware (android) and top of the line hardware (samsung). If you think you need a tablet, forget it - you're really looking for this guy.Bottom line: Don't be an iPad sucker. Chromebooks have the best hardware, Samsung, the best firmware, Android, are half the price, and are open source so you can do much more with them. I also love the BUILT IN keyboard...not the hundred-something dollar attachment you can get for the already overpriced iPad.", "\"I purchased two of these computers for my wife and oldest daughter.  This Is not so much a review of Google Chrome as it is of the computer it self.This is a light weight, sleek looking computer with a bright clear screen in a really good looking case. The keyboard is very good and overall it is a very operational device.When looking at Windows computers in this price range, it looks amazing.  The question, why can't entry level Windows computers look like this?  Why do you have to spend in excess of $1000.00 to get a computer that is this light weight?SSD drives are dirt cheap these days and you do not need the fastest SSD on the planet, after all I am talking about entry level Windows PC's.  There aren't any exotic metals being used in this device.Congratulations to Samsung on providing a good looking device and Congratulations to Google on producing an operating system that doesn't need an 8 core processor to run fast.Well done.Regarding Chrome, this is not an operating system for power PC or Mac users.  It is, however an excellent operating system for people that browse the web, keep pictures in facebook or other on line sites, need occasionally to open word docs, and use email.  Essentially it is an alternative to a tablet.  I have several tablets in my house, one for my son, one in the kitchen and one in the family room and one that I use on airplanes to watch movies.  The wife doesn't like the touch \"\"keyboard\"\" of the tablets, neither does my oldest daughter.  My son loves his Nexus 7, my middle one is very comfortable with either the computer or tablet.  Personally I like the tablet for some things (quick look up of web sites, quick check of email, listening to Pandora etc.) and a more conventional lap top for others (typing email, business communication's, composing documents, etc.).  I can't stand typing on a tablet or phone.  There are, of course, applications that are Windows specific that this PC can not run.  These are very specific.  For word processing there is Google Docs that while not as full featured as MS Word, it covers most of what people use a word processor for and is free.Chrome fits the group of people that wants a lightweight computer platform with a real keyboard that is not tied to M$ or Apple.Wait until stocks are replenished. I see this computer selling for around $1,000.00 on Amazon now.  That is more than twice the retail price.  The smaller brother to this device is back in stock for around $249.00.The price gouging is testament as to how good this device is.  With patience, you can get this Series 5 550 at it's retail price and not get gouged.\"", "I bought this in September of 2012 so it's a late review. However, mine is holding up well almost 2 years later, with heavy all-day use every day since I bought it. As everything I do is from a web browser (including editing websites), I use it as my primary PC. The 4GB of RAM allows me to keep 20 or so tabs open at the same time. ChromeOS only gets better over time, so no problems there. My only complaint is that the battery only lasts about 2.5 hours now, which is down from about 5 hours when it was new. Other than that it's a solid laptop for anyone who works primarily through a web browser (as a primary PC), or as a secondary PC when you just want to quickly get logged on and get some work done without the hassles (or slowness) of Windows. What will I buy when I replace this unit? Another Chromebook of course! On that note, I recommend 4GB of RAM (or whatever the max that you can get) on any Chromebook if you have more than a few browser tabs open at the same time.", "Here we have a nice incremental update to the Google Chromebook. It just keeps getting better.Very easy to use. Rock solid stability. No fuss, no muss.Very fast boot up time and you can just work.No need to worry about patches and updates, virus's, malware, spyware and all of that crap. Ahh.....so refreshing.Great screen that is bright and sharp, great keyboard, thin and sleek.This is just the best laptop out there.", "\"Purchased the Samsung Series 5 550 3G model because it allowed 2 years free access on Verizon's 3G network.  I was amazed at how after turning it on, selecting our WiFi network and password that my kids could log right into their school's account in a matter of seconds!St Leo the Great of San Jose has all the students using chromebooks.  Each student is issued their own school email address and password.  All their school work is saved in Google docs and on Google drive (cloud based).  All their email, homework, calendar, video lessons, etc. are available.We debated between a MacBook Air, a Windows laptop or a Chromebook.  Overall I'm happy we went with the Chromebook.  There are cheaper Windows laptops out there, and some folks find the WiFi is more stable and the web browser is faster, but for our needs and to keep our kids from having to deal with administering a Windows machine it made sense to pay a premium and go with a Chromebook.Since a Chromebook is basically useless without an internet connection going with the 3G and 2 years free 100mb a month option made sense.  If you use more than 100mb a month you can buy more ($10 for an unlimited day pass).  This is useful if they are working on homework in the car or at a friend's house without WiFi access.  Your 2 year period starts once you configure it in settings (about a 15 min. registration setup - you can configure it by going to the lower right hand corner, choosing your google login icon, select settings and in Internet connection choose mobile data, activate Verizion Wireless).The coolest thing is that anyone can walk up to a Chromebook and if they have a Gmail account (or a school account that uses Google like Bellarmine or St Leo) they can log in.  Everything is stored online and the browser window leaves off right where you left it.A couple of items to point out (see product photos I uploaded):- The AC power cord to brick connector isn't flush.  Not a big deal, but it looks sloppy when you don't get a tight fit.  The power brick has a useful green LED to let you know it is plugged in.- The power tip connector to the laptop isn't flush either.  You do get an amber light on the laptop to show you it is charging, but I do wish Apple would give better licensing terms for their patented magnet power adapter  (magsafe) connection.  I can totally see this small Samsung power tip bending or sending the chromebook flying if someone trips over the power cord.- The trackpad is large and works better than previous models.  It doesn't have Apple's multi-gesture shortcuts and the scroll direction is the opposite of what I like but that can be changed in the trackpad preferences.- The keyboard doesn't have a caps lock key (they put a google search magnifier) but you can use shift+magnifier to toggle caps lock function ON/OFF.  The keyboard isn't backlighted.- The screen has a dull matte non-glass finish which is better for reading (not too many reflections).  The screen size is small at 12.1 inch LCD at WXGA 1280x768 resolution.- Video out is via the full size displayport connector.  I wish Samsung had put a HDMI connector instead.  You'll need to buy a full size displayport to VGA, DVI or HDMI connector for your video output needs.  If you use DVI or VGA you'll also need to buy an mini-jack 1/8\"\" standard audio cable.  Make sure to fully plug the Displayport to HDM cable into the laptop in order for it to fully connect and detect your HDMI TV.Here's a list of the video out adapters you may need to buy:Cable Matters Gold Plated Premium DisplayPort to HDMI Male to Female Cable AdapterAccell B087B-005B UltraAV DisplayPort to DVI-D Single-Link Active Adapter ATI Certified (Black)Accell UltraAV B101B-003B Display Port with VGA Active AdapterBelkin Mini-Stereo Audio Cable (12 feet)- You should take the time to learn the keyboard shortcuts for the Chrome OS.  Hit Ctrl+Alt+? to bring up a graphical map of the keyboard and all the useful shortcuts.- You may get intermittent trying to connect messages inside a Google Docs that locks you out of the document for a few seconds.  I've never noticed this when using the same google doc on a Mac or PC laptop so I'm not sure if this is a Chromebook WiFi adapter issue.  The chromebook has built in gigabit ethernet CAT 6 cable connector so that may be more stable if you run into this too.- The boot up time for a Chromebook is fast! The Chrome browser however is slower than a Chrome browser on your Mac or PC when loading pages.  Hopefully this will improve as Google learns how to optimize their Chrome OS.- Printing is a pain.  Your best bet is to buy a Goolge Cloud compatible printer.  Our HP Envy 110 printer was already Mac Airprint compatible and worked well with the Chromebook.  These new cloud based printers use an email address for your printer so technically you could just email it if all else fails.  Google Cloud Print is tied to a primary Google account that then shares the printer with other users, so be sure to set it up with your primary Google account first.  Lower left corner, select your profile icon and choose settings, choose show advance settings and select Open Google Cloud Printer.- Scanning is also a pain.  Your best bet is that same Google Cloud compatible printer will also allow you to type in your printer's TCPIP address and load a web based scanner utility that you can use to scan a photo into the Chrome browser.  You can then Control+click the image to get the option to do a save image to your Google drive.  In our case our HP envy resets it's IP address every time the router reboots so I'll need to hardcode it's IP address and then save it as a bookmark in the browser to make it easier to access.- The Goolge Chromebook comes with a built in camera for video conferencing across Google Talk and Google+ Hangouts.  You can also use Evernote to use it to capture images as a poor man scanner with OCR detection!- Battery life is awesome.  6+ hours on a full charge.- Plugging an SD card into the slot brings up a folder drive icon and you can copy whatever images you want over to Google Drive.- Kensington security lock hole makes securing your Chromebook a no brainer.  Why Apple dropped this off the MacBook Air makes no sense.  That said, a Macbooks have the Find my iPhone app that also tracks your Mac's location.  The Chromebook has no current method for tracking stolen Chromebooks (something that probably happens frequently at schools).  The good thing is that any data is encrypted on the Chromebook and that you can access all your work on any Chromebook with an Internet connection.- I wish the Chromebook had USB 3, but that said I haven't really connected any USB devices to it yet anyways!If this review helped give it a thumbs up, if not feel free to add your gripe in the comments.  Chromebooks aren't for everyone, but I'm amazed at how the challenge of having to always have an internet connection is offset by the wonderful ease of use of cloud based computing.\"", "\"Boots fast.However it's just a barebones \"\"operating system\"\" with limited functionality and chokes when running flash-intensive sites or highest-quality videos. 16GB storage space is limiting and Cloud doesn't help so much knowing that you have to be in a good wifi network to have it work. For the same amount of money, one could buy a high-tablet, or a low end, but better-in-most-ways laptop. Properly configured Windows can bootup on a standard harddrive in under 30 seconds or under 10 seconds on a SSD, and can resume from sleep mode almost instantly. This makes the novelty of Chrome OS's boot times less impressive.\"", "I love this PC! While it cannot substitute for a MAC, Windows, or Linux PC, it is never the less a very useful computer to have around to use mainly for web based work. It does have some support and uses while not connected to the internet, but I mainly use it a home. I did take one to Italy while on Vacation, and it worked well there with a rented Hotspot.It's best attributes for me are that it is self-maintaining, 7 seconds or so boot-up (Really), wake from sleep about as fast as opening the lid (WiFi connects about a second later too), lightweight, long battery life, great keyboard and track pad (really, both are the best I ever used), and any Google user may login and make it their PC temporarily. I use a Linux desktop and Laptop as my main PCs along with a work Win7 laptop, so the fact that this PC is self-maintaining is a big deal. It just works! No fuss! Updates amount to a restart and a minute or two.I also own a Linux Ubuntu laptop too, and while it is really good (Asus X201E-DH01), this Chromebook keyboard and track pad just out-do anything else I can recall using!PS. IF you are an advanced PC user I have found this Asus X201E-DH01 on Google Shopping searches is often for sale for the low $200s. Be aware that they often list it with 2GB of memory, but this X201E-DH01 model has 4GB memory soldered onto the motherboard. A recommended great purchase if you are able to deal with Linux (not for you if don't fix most of your own PC issues). If you need more than this Chromebook and can only buy one PC, this is a great alternative for less $$$ too!After buying the first Chromebook in June 2012, we got one for my girlfriend's mother who lives in Moldova (we live in VA USA). She is 82 and basically only Russian speaking, and she learned how to use the Chromebook with the help of an Instructor woman in Moldova, and she is now connected! We got this PC in 11/2012.Then I got my mom in PA the same Chromebook for Christmas 2012 along with home internet. I was trying to get her to adopt being slightly connected, but she did not really stick with it. Sigh!!!!Then I got my girlfriend one to replace a dying aging Win laptop (Valentines 2013). She had already been using mine and her moms while visiting Moldova, so she loves it too. I bought this one on eBay for about $125 less than Amazon.In 11/2013 we got my girlfriends twenties daughter the same Chromebook as a B-day present. She has been using mine when staying over at our home, so I expect she will enjoy the present. By this time I could only find a refurb unit on eBay, but it seemed to be new, but was stamped refurb on the SN area... $309, not bad.I keep buying this model Chromebook because as far as I can determine this is still the best Chromebook hardware platform ever made except for the $1000+ Pixel model.As for what we have found to be the biggest Chromebook use limitations in our daily lives;1. For my girlfriend, calling Europe with Skype is not possible. Skype still does not have a web based platform... She has gotten some to use Google hangouts, but mainly she just uses her MAC Mini, iPhone, and could use several other Tablets and PCs in the house if needed... She does talk to the daughter in CA with Google Hangouts (the daughter we got this same PC for...).2. Selling on eBay; the photo uploading aspect of eBay selling does not work correctly on this Chromebook and I expect this must be true on all Chromebooks. The last time we checked this was summer 2013. Maybe Google or eBay will eventually resolve this some day. I hear the main issue is eBay not adopting modern web page standards, and Google not providing the backwards support (I suspect due to security issues).Those are the two biggies for us. I hear that you cannot watch Netflix movies either. We have enough ways to do this that it is not an issue for us (Nexus Tablets (or iPhones or iPad) and Chromecast travelling, Google TVs at home with HDTVs. I find I only watch a full movie if I have an HDTV available... It is amazing what you can do with a Chromcast and iPhone! Very interesting little device. I use it in hotels while traveling for work.Uploading or transferring photos from SD cards or other USB methods to USB hard drives or up to an online storage is possible, but not so speedy for large quantities. I have found that even while at home with super-fast internet and WiFi, I tend to go to another PC to work with a lot of photos, say more than 50 or 100 2-3 MB photos.That's about it...", "Amazing little computer from Samsung that gives access to the ubiquitous world of Google, seamlessly and lightning fast. Solidly built and easy to carry around. Great battery up to 16 hours per charge !  Relatively cheap and undoubtedly a great value.", "I've had this Chromebook since July and I still can't put it down and my Windows laptop is collecting dust because I only turn it on to conduct the maintenance. After carefully realizing  what I used a computer for, I realized that I only really used the browser 98% of the time. This device saved me from wasting money because I used to buy custom hp laptops costing over twice as much only to mainly use the browser and it also saved me from buying a dreaded Windows 8 device...thank god.For those of you requiring dedicated programs and hard core games, this is not for you. So don't go out and buy one knowing it can't run windows programs or hard core game so that you can whine about it and write a bad review.I like the size, weight,the speed, coolness, battery life, aluminum palm rest, ports and connections on the side instead of the back like the newer smaller cheaper one and this one plays Netflixs out of the box.  The screen looks great and its really bright and the speaker sound good for their size. Google and Samsung built something I needed and not just what I wanted. Since owning my Chromebook its got better and better with more features added and becoming more like a real OS.Although I had it for 5 months I still got the 100 gb cloud storage upgrade and every new Chromebook comes with 12 free go air in flight wifi sessions...its been a great device.  It has frozen on me a few times but all it requires to reset is unpluging with the screen on and pushing the pin size reset button under the track pad and plugging in, hit power and that's it."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.006178488489240408, 0.0021059117279946804, 0.1725437492132187, 0.000695378752425313, 0.0009411911596544087, 0.0019277191022410989, 0.26790931820869446, 0.00042324489913880825, 0.2517644762992859, 0.0061383238062262535, 0.06965318322181702, 0.061813440173864365, 0.1405239850282669, 0.017381545156240463]]}
