"], "reviews": ["On a cold wintry morning there is nothing better and nothing easier than this delicious oatmeal.  You need only tear open the package and add about 1/2 coup to 3/4 cup of water and then put it in the microwave for about a minute and a half and you have the best breakfast ever.  The flavor I tried was cinnamon and apples---YUMMY!  My very favorite is Raisin, date and almond.To each his own on the flavors but you simply cannot go wrong with this stuff.  Highly recommend you buy this.", "There's not much I can say about Quaker oatmeal, as I've never met a single person who hasn't had it. And this product is pretty much exactly what you'd expect: good, healthy, hearty oatmeal. The flavors are all quite good (especially if you throw in a few chocolate chips). I especially like Maple & Brown Sugar, which does have an amazing scent of fresh maple syrup.The single-serving bags are also quite handy. There's even a fill-line on the bag which indicates how much liquid (i.e. milk or water, your choice) to add. So, overall, it's a good product.", "This is a great offering from Quaker!  The oatmeal packets are quick to fix, taste heavenly and are hot and filling for a cold winter's morning.  More importantly, if you have kids, it's something they can make for themselves and it won't make a mess!  I love the fact that there are three different kinds of oatmeal in each box; that way everyone can find something to their own taste!  I would give it more than five stars if Amazon would let me!!", "\"After eating a packet of oatmeal for breakfast I did find that my energy stayed more level and that my snack cravings stayed away longer. When I added either an apple, banana or cup of yogurt on the side of it, it kept me full until lunch.I like that Quaker is marking the packages with lines for water now. I can imagine this is really helpful for eating this in an office setting where measuring cups are not available (most likely) or for taking in a camper or something where you don't have every convenience of your home kitchen.The directions are as simple as ever. Add water, stir and heat it in microwave. There are also directions for using hot water to pour into the bowl over the dry oatmeal. (I'm assuming for a situation similar to above or maybe in a hotel breakfast situation.) I did the microwave directions and it was well cooked each time. The texture was a bit gummy and pasty, but it's instant oatmeal and that was expected. I prefer the Quaker Real Medleys for texture.The flavors weren't super or anything. I didn't taste much maple with the Maple and Brown Sugar variety. It was easy enough to add a touch of sugar free syrup to sweeten it a bit. One time I added raisins and it was good.The Apples and Cinnamon was okay. I didn't care for the texture of the apple. It was really mushy. I'd prefer chopping my own fresh apple and adding to a hot bowl of oatmeal.The box here on Amazon shows the third flavor as \"\"Original\"\" but my box had \"\"Cinnamon and Spice\"\". I did not care for this one at all. There was too much \"\"spice\"\" for my taste and I couldn't pinpoint what the \"\"spice\"\" was. I don't think I'll seek out that variety in the future.\"", "We eat a lot of oatmeal at our house. During the week there's just not enough time for a sit down meal. Quaker Oatmeal is a good fit for our hectic schedules.  It's quick, filling and tasty.  Oh, and it's healthy. The variety pack offers something for everyone.  As I said it's filling, but low calorie and it's good for your heart. You can't go wrong with this one.", "I always enjoyed the apple cinnamon the best.  I started eating it as a child in the early 80's.  Since then it seems that the flavoring has changed slightly (smaller & fewer apples), but as a whole it's still the oatmeal I remember.  If I had to pick a second flavor - it was Maple & Brown Sugar. To me the flavor was more similar to maple syrup when I was a kid, but not overly sweet. Now it seems like the sweetness is still there but it tastes more like just sugar not the maple. The third flavor is Cinnamon & Spice, which is not bad - just my least favorite of this group.  I can taste the cinnamon, but not really any other spices.This particular box I got was those 3 flavors (Apple Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar & Cinnamon Spice), not the ones shown on the box which included the original (plain flavored).  Not sure why they had changed it (could be just our particular review box).  I had bought this before and it was identical to the pictured.  To me though, this was a better mixture without original.For the money, I really shouldn't complain about anything - there aren't very many fast, healthy, cheap foods out there.", "While I was skeptical about instant oatmeal, I figured, it's still oatmeal, how bad could it be? The answer is really bad. I'd give it just one star, but I figure that if you buy the instant, sugary version of something that normall takes about 10 minutes to cook, you know what you're getting into.As far as instant oatmeal goes, the only other one I've had in the last 5 years is McCann's. While still instant and lacking in the body and flavor of real oatmeal, at least it has some structure and flavor to it. This stuff is more like staggeringly sweet, gluey gruel. I was shocked at how sweet it was & noted that it has 12g sugar a packet (making them 28% sugar by weight; the regular ice cream in my freezer has 16g/69g serving, making it 23% sugar, just sayin').  I'm not against Quaker as a brand. I'm fine with regular Quaker Oats and I really like the Quaker granola.The only good thing I can say about them is that the have more fiber (3-4g) than other sugary children's cereals.Apple cinnamon packet (best stats of the box) Vs Bob's Extra Thick Rolled Oats, the &#34;real&#34; oatmeal in my pantry (I did the math so both serving sizes are 43g, the packet size)Bob's 171 cal, 3g fat 0mg sodium, 28g carbs, &#60;1g sugar, 4.5g fiber, 6g proteinQuaker AC instant 160 cal, 2g fat, 200mg sodium, 33g carbs, 12g sugar, 4 g fiber, 4g proteinOf course, it's no revelation real oatmeal is healthier, but with all the extra sugar and sodium, and minus the extra good stuff, you'd at least expect it to *taste* good.One final note: Maple AND Brown Sugar  flavor? Really?", "It is hard to find fault with this product. You get handy single serving pouches of whatever flavor takes your fancy and just pop it into the microwave.  Just one thing, if you add milk there is a tendency for the product to boil over within the recommended microwaving time.  So, if you do want to add milk, I'd suggest checking and stirring before the full microwave time has elapsed.", "Since we will often add fruit to our oatmeal we don't need a lot of sugar and Quaker Instant does not have to much sugar, it is what I would describe as light on sugar.  Recommended.", "We try to keep instant oats on hand, especially in the cooler months.  It's fast and easy for mornings when I don't have time to cook breakfast or our schedules don't allow us time to eat together.  The variety pack keeps you from getting bored with the selection and anyone can follow the directions to make their own when they want.We really liked the flavors in this variety pack.  Over the years, we've tried some of the less expensive generic brands but didn't like them as well.", "I love Quaker instant oatmeal packets and have been eating them since I was a child. I particularly enjoy them ass an adult for their convenience for work and travel. I can pop a couple in my purse and I keep a few in my glove box. Since hot water or a microwave can be found anywhere this is a nice healthy little pick-me-up snack so its more than a breakfast these days.This 48-count box holds the three basic flavors: maple, apple cinnamon * cinnamon sugar so nothing is needed to add to the flavor and for the price this is a nice little stock pile.", "Quaker Instant Oats are easy to make and taste great.  Add some fruit and you've got a simple, healthy breakfast that even the pickiest eater will enjoy.  All three flavors in this variety pack are good (they finally did away with the Peaches 'n' Cream flavor that was overly sweet).  You can make a bowl with either hot water or else milk if you like it a little bit creamier in under two minutes.  The portions are perfect for kids.", "The perception of a good breakfast/start of the day is sometimes enough. Everyone seems to be trying to find the better combination to start a good day. Quaker Instant Oats Variety Pack, 48-Count, are not new at the market, but they have that friendly face on the cover (what era is that? colony time?), and this is one of those products that is imbedded in the breakfast world. Who hasn't heard of the Quaker guy? I overheard someone say, probably a breakfast expert, that the instant oatmeal was not as nutritious as the old time, the one you have to cook for at least 10 minutes.The advantages of the Instant are quite apparent. A person could realistically fill a microwave safe container with this oatmeal and water, and in less the 3 minutes it is done. This is very convenient a lot of times, and allows to a person to feel they had a good breakfast (commercials and all) without having to add additional sugar if not desired. I know the variations are quite staggering: add fruit, add flax, add cinnamon, add milk, etc. In the end it works. Some people, those blessed with a healthy appetite upon waking up, can do 2 of the instant bags to make completely sure the tank is filled with good fuel.Oatmeal by Quaker is hard to challenge. Besides the rumor that the instant variety lack this or that, they deliver every time.  One, of course, would like to think that Quaker is quite concerned about the welfare of its consumer base, and wouldn't be inclined to sell a product that could be considered detrimental to the overall health of the people that are loyal to the brand. Or at least that is what I prefer to think, the perception of a good breakfast by eating oatmeal, be that instant or old fashioned, is alive and well in my small world. They most certainly deserve 4 Stars, having been around for so long. Amazon, once again, deserves 5 Stars, for they were kind enough to send me a small count box. I would be lying through my teeth if I said I never had them before, but it was nice to try them once again. Let's just leave it at that. 4 Stars for a good enough breakfast!", "Quaker oatmeal has been around for decades. I use a lot of these packs because I often have to eat breakfast at work. The individual packs are small and lightweight, easily fitting into your pocket or suitcase pouch. I usually eat two packs for one breakfast meal. This variety box includes all of my favorite flavors: original, apple cinnamon, and maple & sugar. Unlike other reviewers, I personally didn't notice a change in flavor from when I last had Quaker oats, but I guess there's no accounting for taste. For the price, it's actually a pretty good deal.", "I love oatmeal and I really like the convenience of being able to grab a pack and cook it in the microwave in 2 minutes!  I don't mind eating the same flavor over and over (Maple is my favorite) but my husband prefers to mix it up a bit so was happy I got a variety pack.  His favorite is the Apple.  We typically add something to the Original like fruit.  The packs are a reasonable size and are around 160 calories each, but we typically still have something else with it, like more fruit, turkey sausage ect. because the bowl isn't really going to fill you up for very long.  Quality is alaways good from Amazon so you aren't getting old shelf work product.", "Oatmeal is healthy and Quaker instant Oats is easy and quick.  With the many varieties, you don't get tired of just one flavor.  I take it to work and within seconds I have a hot breakfast that is much better than any fast food restaurant meal; and much cheaper than their healthy options.  This one is a staple on my shopping list.  I love it and so does the family.", "\"\"\"Quaker Instant Oats Variety Pack, 48-Count\"\" is all together terrific breakfast food. It's healthy, filling, the flavors are tasty, it's easy to prepare and the self-contained packets make for great portability for those on the go...but you knew all of this, so go pick up some already. Highly recommended.\"", "Seriously? Who doesn't love oatmeal or the fact that's it's probably the quickest and easiest way to have a healthy breakfast. The individual packets make oatmeal an even quicker meal for rushed mornings, and if you're still running out of time, you can grab one as you run out the door and make it once you get to work. A coffee mug + water + packet = breakfast that isn't a donut. It's just that easy and doesn't allow for excuses as to why someone hasn't had a decent breakfast.", "Love the flavors and this makes for a great healthy breakfast at the office.  It's quick and easy and much better than skipping breakfast or having fast food or doughnuts.My favorite is the Maple and Brown sugar- but all the flavors are pretty good.  I think the thing that makes this a big winner is the quick preparation.  Not as fast as a granola bar but when you want a hot meal, especially in winter this cannot be beat, and I think it's more filling anyway.", "In my family, we each have a favorite flavor and they are not all the same.  This variety pack makes everyone happy.  This package offers variety but also is a great value.  I really enjoy not having to worry about making it for the kids-the ease of making this instant oatmeal means a hot healthy breakfast is just as quick as a bowl of cereal.  AND it is such a good way to kick-start my morning.", "Quaker's Instant Oats Variety Pack is a fine, flavorful grouping of quick cook breakfast and snack food. The flavor combinations offered here: Original, Maple & Brown Sugar and Apples and Cinnamon are well done and tasty. The size of individual packets usually requires for two at a time to be mixed, for the average adult, for a suitable breakfast portion.The great negative here is the amount of sweeteners added to the product and subsequently, the amount of carbohydrates added to each packet of quick oats. In a time when many consumers are attempting to cut sugars and carbs, I would think that Quaker could respond with a mass market, flavorful product with less of both.Otherwise, as a traditional, easy to serve, consume anywhere product, this quick oat variety pack does as promised and the consumer should not be disappointed by it.", "\"We love oatmeal around our house, and this is a very good instant oatmeal. I love having a variety of flavors available and the ease of \"\"just add hot water.\"\" The packets are the perfect size for throwing in your purse or diaper bag for lunch on the go, and are just the right portion for little ones.I love the redesigned pantry friendly box, that was a great addition to an already great product.\"", "\"I have eaten several varieties of instant oatmeal in my life, but always find myself returning to Quaker Instant Oats for consistency and flavor.  The variety pack offers four packets of maple & brown sugar, four packets of apple & cinnamon, as well as two packs of cinnamon & spice.  Each has a great flavor, with the maple & brown sugar being my tried and true favorite.  The price point is never much more than the \"\"store\"\" brands, but the peace of mind I get from the quality and not wondering if the oatmeal will live up to it's \"\"rep\"\" is why I stick with Quaker unless for some reason it is out of stock.\"", "As I get older I find that Quaker oats provides exactly what I need in the morning. Mom always used to make Quaker oats on cold winter mornings. ( in the original tall box , and certainly not as quick and easy).45 plus years later , I find that Quaker oats provides so many benefits that I enjoy it 5 out of 7 days , year round.This variety pack is nice so that you can change things up without having to have dozens of boxes laying around.", "It's hard to sit down to breakfast on work / school days. We all pretty much do our own thing as time allows in the morning. Toast, toaster pastries and cold cereal have filled the bill. I ordered the Quaker Instant Oats Variety Pack because it's handy to have an additional quick breakfast option.We burned through the 48 individual packs in much less time than I expected. Maybe it was the introduction of something new, or maybe it's because oatmeal is so darn homey, comforting and delicious. For me, it was all that plus the portability factor.If I'm running too late to even make toast, I can grab a pack and have a quick breakfast at work in less time than it takes to make tea. Needless to say, a breakfast that costs less than fifty cents is another decided plus these days.So simple and satisfying, Quaker Instant Oats have assumed a permanent spot in our rotation of breakfast options.", "For me, I prefer regular cooking of oatmeal, but this does have advantages. The advantages are 1) it can be prepared quickly by just adding hot water, so can really be prepared quickly anywhere where there is a way to boil water 2) it already comes in 2 tasty flavors, plus original plain, and overall they are nearly as good as cooking oatmeal the regular way, though more expensive, but still an economically reasonable breakfast staple. If, just compared on taste to regular cooking of oatmeal, I say this would rank 4 stars, but the convenience does have to add something, so I give it 5 stars overall.", "\"Gotta say, I love Quaker Oats.  This pack gives you a decent variety among three flavors, and of course you can doctor it up (I like to put Craisins in my oatmeal!).  The packets are convenient and shelf life is substantial.  I keep some of these in my emergency kit and rotate them out as necessary.Even if you eat oatmeal every morning, 48 packets is going to keep you for awhile.  One packet is a reasonable serving size for an adult.  Or take a packet to work and heat it up in a bowl in your microwave, or use hot water from the water dispenser.  Pretty bulletproof and, like the old cereal commercials used to say, \"\"It's part of a complete breakfast!\"\"Good serving sizes, good flavors, and ultra-easy to make.  I'm sold!\"", "\"Since one packet of flavored Quaker Oatmeal is tasty, but not quite filling enough, I combine one flavored packet with one packet of \"\"Original\"\" (unflavored) Instant Quaker Oats.  I recommend purchasing one package of each and doing the same.\"", "Three is not exactly a lot of variety, but I do like that I can make combinations like Apple Cinnamon Brown Sugar Maple or to mix the plain with one of the other flavors if I do not want something as sweet.  Quaker Instant is one of my favorite brands of instant oatmeal.  I consistently feel full after eating this brand and do not feel like I am eating something unhealthy.  The consistency is very good and oatmealy without being too wet, sticky or dry.  Overall, a great product.  Could use a little more variety of flavors other than just three, but three is better than having to buy an individual box of each just to mix flavors.", "We love oatmeal for breakfast!! Mmmm-mmm-good!! And heart healthy too.  Apples and Cinnamon, Maple & Brown Sugar, Original; whatever the flavor, we love it and eat it everyday.  Mixes easy right in the bowl.  Just add boiling water and mix to the thickness you like.  Ready fast, tastes great, satisfying and good for you -- what more could you ask of a product.  The variety packs are more affordable than the usual 10 packs. The box is huge though!  Make room for it.  But sooooo worth it.  Have been eating Quaker Oats daily for years, and plan on continuing.  We add our own raisins, mixed nuts, chopped dates, chopped prunes (yup!) and cranberries are especially delish!!  We change it up every day.  Add whatever you like, just keep it healthy, or what's the point?!?!  Will buy again.... and again.... and again! Happy! :oP", "Quaker instant oats couldn't be easier to perpare, the pouch has a line on it that can be used to measure the amount of milk or water to add.  Pop it into a microwave for a minute or two and it is ready to eat.  The only drawback is that it is pre-sweetened and is on the sweet side.  Of course, kids love these instant oats and it is a better breakfast than other options. They are also a great option for travel.", "Being that I am dieting, I didn't try these but my husband did. He eats oatmeal every morning and usually eats Great Value. Per my husband, he thinks the texture and grains were smaller than the Great Value brand. The reason he bought the Great Value brand in the first place was, well, because it was a value at about $2.19 for a box of 10. The nutritional value and flavors are somewhat similar, but he couldn't swallow the fact that he could buy 5 boxes of 10 Great Value Oatmeal for approximately $11, when 48 packets (equivalent of 5 boxes minus 2) is $18.33 (and that is not the actual retail price of $22.45).
