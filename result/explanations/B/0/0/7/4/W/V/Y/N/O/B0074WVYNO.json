I have a Harmony remote, which has been rendered virtually useless other than changing the channel on the satellite dish, because the TV only uses IR for power -- everything else is UHF (why have IR at all if you're not going to support the basics?). The TV does come with an IR blaster that will control up to two IR devices using the TV remote, but the commands available are limited (and not programmable, hence I have to use both remotes).  For example, the TV remote does not have DVR buttons or page up/down -- both very useful with Dish Network.When my husband and I first set it up, the TV kept shutting off.  We had to do some re-wiring to finally get it to work.  Our Sony Surround Sound System has a pass-through capability that doesn't work with this TV.  We used to be able to leave it on stand-by, and now we have to leave the surround sound on and turn the volume off in order to listen to the TV.  If you use the pass-through, the TV shuts off.  As an aside, this was very frustrating to deal with until we figured out what the TV wanted (which wasn't what we wanted). The bottom line is that no TV should force a specific wiring configuration.  I should be able to wire the way I want to (which worked with every other TV that we've had).The Netflix integration is nice.  Before, we had to run the Netflix through the PS3, but now it's just on because the TV is connected to the internet and has apps for things like Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, etc., and even games like Space Invaders 3D.  I like that it auto-updates for these apps since when I used the PS3 for Netflix, I would spend a lot of time waiting for updates to go through. We have used the internet option to surf, though really it's not as easy as it would be on a regular computer.  The kids sometimes watch things on YouTube on the TV, which they like because of the large screen.The red function letters on the remote are dark and hard to read without a magnifying glass.  The qwerty keyboard is nice too, since you can type in queries for things like Netflix, versus an on-screen pointing keyboard.As for the 3D capability, this TV came with 6 pairs of 3D glasses.  These fit adults much better than kids.  However, the kids just love watching 3D movies on the large screen.The picture is very good, and high-def 3D movies really do look like you're looking out a window, rather than at a TV.  55\"\" screen is great for us since our living room is about 20 feet wide. 3D works from pretty much any angle that we sit at, which is nice.Overall, after the wiring kinks were worked out, my family loves this TV. There are some things we don't like, but for the most part, we are very happy with it.\"", "\"The LG 55G2 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Google TV comes with six pairs of 3-D glasses (with these glasses you can watch 2-D programs converted to 3-D) and a remote control that features a QWERTY keyboard, mouse, and voice control.  It features Google TV user interface and you can use it to not only watch TV but watch YouTube videos, Netflix, Facebook, use it to play games and much more.Delivery and installation: this is a huge TV that weighs over 70 pounds so I was a bit nervous about getting it into my house and setting it up.  Fortunately, Amazon used a delivery service, CEVA, that did an excellent job.  They called to set up a delivery time, delivered the TV within the set time period, set up the TV, showed me how to work it, and hauled away the packaging.  I had to do nothing but sit back and enjoy the TV.The remote: there is definitely a learning curve when using the remote.  It has a QWERTY keyboard on one side and a regular remote on the other side (if you consider a built in mouse a regular feature on a remote!) It did take me some time to get used to the remote.  The keyboard is very small and it can be difficult to figure out how to use the keyboard to type things like \"\"@\"\".Picture/sound quality: the picture is awesome!  At 55 inches the TV is basically all screen without any border.  The picture looks HD even when I am not on the HD channels (the picture quality is much better on the HD channels).  The color is wonderful and, although I did check the settings, was set to the right colors the first time I turned it on.  The sound is also good, in fact I often have to turn the volume down.  I do have surround sound but the sound is still great even when I am not using the surround sound.Apps: this TV is full of apps starting with Google (you have to sign in to Google to begin watching the TV).  Besides watching regular TV shows, you can watch movies from sites like Netflix or Amazon, surf the Internet, watch YouTube, play games, check your Facebook page, watch HBO to go, and more.  Because of the remote it can be a bit awkward to navigate some of these apps (for example checking your Google Mail), but being able to watch streaming Netflix makes it all worthwhile.3-D: I had two concerns about the 3-D: one) THAT the glasses wouldn't fit over my own glasses and 2) that the 3-D was a gimmick.  Happily, the 3-D glasses fit quite comfortably over my own glasses.  I like the fact that the TV comes with six pairs of glasses and you don't need a battery or anything else to use them - just slip them on and you're good to go.  As for the 3-D being gimmicky - it is hard to tell.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player to test movies on.  I did use the \"\"convert 2-D to 3-D\"\" feature and it worked pretty well.  Most of the time you don't notice the difference but occasionally something will stand out (literally) that makes me go \"\"wow!\"\" Unfortunately the 3-D channel featured on the TV doesn't work.  It is too bad as it looks like there are some awesome videos there.  I hope this feature gets fixed soon.Bottom-line: this TV is expensive but you get a lot for your money and it is worth it if you want a TV watching experience that feels like you're in a movie theater.July 26, 2012: LG has fixed the problem with the 3-D channel and it now works. It is as awesome as I thought it would be. The 3-D is incredible and I feel like I can reach out and touch the images. Well done and thanks LG for fixing the problem.\"", "This television provides the most advanced features for a reasonable price. With 3D technology, LED backlight, and Google TV to bring in the Internet, we moved a big step up from our previous television, a Sony Bravia with a fluorescent backlight, in terms of technology. This television is thinner, lighter, can access the Internet without a separate box, and gives us 3D technology.Any drawbacks? One I've noticed is the matte finish on our Sony Bravia got rid of the glare that we see on this LG. While this television is not quite the mirror finish I see on some televisions, it does reflect quite a bit of light compared to a matte finish. That's all right, though, because I've gotten used to the glare and do not notice it anymore.Another drawback (for me at least) is the dimming of the display when the ambient light in the room is low. I'm sure there is a way to adjust that, but I have not found out how. When the light is low, the television brightness is too low, so I switch on a light to keep the room a little lighter.One final drawback--our Sony television sits rock solid on its stand. This television moves left and right if touched or bumped. It seems very stable, and that movement seems to be a feature, not a bug, that is intended to give the ability to swivel the television on its stand. But we have no need for the swivel feature, and it is a little disconcerting to feel this big and heavy device move when you touch it. A stable stand would make it feel more secure.The remote control takes a little getting used to. It's compact and cleverly built, and apparently LG has been improving the functioning over the years since it was introduced. But I thought it would be easier to use than it is. I rarely use the Internet on the television for anything other than the simplest of tasks. It's much easier to just get a laptop and use that. That's unfortunate, because it's rather fun to use this big screen as a computer.The 3D technology was quite dramatic the first time I used it. It's a stunning experience to have that technology in our own living room. But after watching a few of the samples that can be accessed through this television, I have not used the 3D function at all. It may still be a while before 3D technology grows to be more than a curiosity. It would be fun to watch a hockey game filmed and broadcast in 3D, but that's still in the future.There are lots of features and tuning available with this television. We have not done much with any of it, since we have been satisfied with the color and look of the television out of the box. The sound too is quite impressive, and we do not use separate speakers. In all, we are very satisfied with the television, and consider it a big step up from our previous television, now demoted to a bedroom.", "I now have three LG HDTVs in my house which gives me a unique opportunity to compare this new offering to the previous models.  My first 3D TV was theLG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inchwhich I bought because of the great price point and feature set.  It's a great TV but theLG 47LM6200 47-Inchthat we have in the bedroom provided a significant upgrade on the software side.Now, we are playing with the 55G2.  I was excited because one of my main complaints with both the other LGs we own is the lack of a proper keyboard to interface with all the cool features of the TVs.  It's so tortureous to hunt and click, even with the magic remote, to select movies from Amazon Prime or whatever.  This new, GoogleTV version comes with a really great remote which addresses this issue in an elegant way.  You have the magic remote (which provides cursor control on the TV with a wave of your hand) along with a full compact query keyboard on the other side.  You also get voice recognition to further add to your data input options.  Very, very cool.  This remote also will control other devices in your system such as your DVD player and stereo receiver so it (almost) renders myLogitech Harmony One Universal Remoteobsolete.The picture of the G2 is goergeous.  Bright and clear.  I read some reviews that claim the LW5600 has better blacks and a matte screen (for less reflection) which I suppose is true but I haven't had any problems with my G2 in regular use.  I do prefer the black edge of my LW5600 to the faux-brused aluminum of the G2, but that's just cosmetics.GoogleTV is still a beta product in my view, but it's pretty cool.  Certainly more useful than myApple TVeven if it's a little less elegant.  I see a lot of potential here if they can keep working on it.  The integration with my Dish Network DVR is really neat, by the way.  You can type in what you want to watch and it'll give you all the options in a search.  This is Google doing what it does best.What sucks about the G2 is that some of my favorite features from the LM6200 and even my LW5600 are missing.  Amazon Prime support is only available through the web browser on the G2.  What the hell?  Perhaps we'll see an app that will address this but for now, it's a pretty clunky solution.  Basically, the GoogleTV interface sort of replaces the LG interface.  For the TV specific stuff like the settings, the LG version was superior in almost every way.  This was a mistake on LGs part.Here's another bizarre change.  My G2 doesn't recognize my LG Blu-Ray DVD player as a companion product.  My LW5600 was totally integrated with my Blu-Ray player.  If I put in a DVD, it automatically turned on the TV, changed the input and so on.  Now, with the G2, I see no benefit to having a LG DVD player.  It treats it like just another video input.  This really surprised me.I'm still playing with the TV so I'll update the review as I discover more.In summary, I have to say this TV is a mixed bag.  If you factor in the price, I think I'd go with the LM6200 which is a great TV and much less expensive.  The GoogleTV platform shows potential though so perhaps the next release will address my complaints.  For now, I don't think the G2 is worth the premium price tag.", "I really like this TV. The picture is great. I don't use the online features very often, nor do I really watch in 3D. I was surprised to see that I can turn any regular picture into 3D, but the 3D still seems like more of a novelty than anything and I'd rather watch in 2D. The TV looks amazing over my fireplace.", "\"I was really, really excited about getting to review this TV. I use LG monitors in my \"\"day job,\"\" and am extremely happy with them. In fact I spec them as standard equipment in all our AV installations. Most of them are 55 inch models, but I recently got  two 22 inch (22LS3500) and one 65 inch (65LW6500) models, which I will soon review as well. I love LG monitors.The set arrived by freight due to size, but was very easy to unbox. LG has a fantastic two part box banded together - cut the bands and the box lifts up easily off a base holding the set and hefty foam protection. It definitely takes two people to unbox and move this set, due to size but not weight. I can easily lift the unit by myself (and I'm not that strong), but it is just too ungainly for one person to move it around easily. With two people, it is very easy to move.The base comes in two parts that attach with four bolts. Four more (same size) attach the base to the set. once on the base, the set can swivel back and forth plus or minus about 30 degrees. It is very smooth  and solid for a set this large on a single point base.The connections are a bit sparse for me, but I realize that industry is pushing everyone to HDMI, mostly for the digital Rights Management (DRM) advantages it offers Big Media. There is one VGA connector, one composite video, and one set of component video inputs, along with their attendant audio connectors. There are 4 HDMI connectors, and one USB connector (along with some other USB-like connectors).The composite and component connections are highly non-standard. They are on 1/8 inch (3.5mm) jacks, and the set comes with short adapters that plug in to those connections, offering regular RCA connectors for standard cables. The plugs are set vertically, facing down, which immediately brought gravity concerns to mind - will the constant pull on the connectors cause them to malfunction sooner? It is probably easier to attach things if the set is wall mounted, but the use of non-standard connections and non-standard adapters will create unnecessary headaches down the road (as in losing the adapters...).As someone with a large amount of AV gear, there are simply too few connections for my tastes, especially on this large and expensive a unit, and the non-standard connectors are a serious negative. There is plenty of real estate on this set for a much better choice of connections.The remote is small and the qwerty keys are difficult to read. The markings for the alternate functions are nearly impossible to read, due to size and color. This is a major departure for LG, whose remotes have always been large enough to read and use easily. The ergonomics and layout of the remote are quite poor, and the battery pack access (2 AAA batteries) is also odd.The \"\"magic, wave it in the air to move the pointer\"\" function was more usable than I thought it would be, but the remote's sensitivity to movement made it harder to make menu choices - you have to hold it very still, and pressing some buttons was hard enough that one can easily move the remote by mistake.  It worked much better using two hands. This could cause considerable arm fatigue in long sessions.The user interface is a radical departure from the functional and easy to use LG standard. With the scant documentation (the paper \"\"quick start\"\" guide with mine was missing print on many pages - a very poor printing job - and the documentation was way below LG's usual standard), it was difficult to figure out the new system, and after quite some time of fighting the remote and using the pdf from the CD, I finally figured out that a great many functions (like the USB port) are simply not available until you \"\"register\"\" your set with Google. Major fail.For a long time, the set also refused to auto adjust to which input I was using, and I had to reset the default input every time I turned on the set. Picking an input menu, which is usually a single button press on other LG sets, now requires one to go 3 or 4 levels deep into the menu system, then use the \"\"back\"\" button the same number of times to get back to a picture. This is very poor interface design, and a huge step backward in usability. I don't understand why so many computer interface designers think that moving through a ton of menus is better than going directly to your choices with a single button press. This is the same kind of thinking which has created messes like Ubuntu's Unity interface, making simple tasks much harder and requiring a much steeper learning curve. That is simply not good design.After fighting the interface for a few days, I got \"\"trained\"\" to its oddities, and can move through it fairly quickly to do what I need. The lack of function without registering with Google crippled my exploration of many features, as my broadband connection died for many days around the time I got this set. I am moving the set to another location to test it with cable TV, as I gave that up over a decade ago. I will test the Google portion of it as soon as I move it back and will update this review.As for ultimate viewing experience, I consider 3D a mildly amusing, but a mostly useless fad. I don't have any 3D content but did try some 2D content with the 3D translation. It was interesting, but gave me a headache in about 5 minutes. Basically, if you like the small postcards with lenticular coverings which look \"\"3D\"\" as you move them around, then 3D will impress you. We are still a long, long way from virtual reality.That said, the 2D experience was nothing short of spectacular, especially over the HDMI connection. Even regular DVD content looked remarkable, and I immediately launched into watching many favorite movies again to see what they were like on this good a display. Summer Lovers was unbelievable - the cinematography fairly jumped off the screen, and the vistas of the Greek islands was stunning. The IMAX Dolphins feature was equally stunning, as were other movies I tried. How much of that was due to the quality of my upscaling Philips DVD player I can't say, as I have no other brands of DVD player to test (I've found Philips to be hands down the best). In any case the combination was outrageous, and I love the picture quality.The difference as one moved up from composite to component video, then to HDMI was striking. I'm not easily impressed by technology, but I can honestly call the picture quality breathtaking. Other who viewed it with me described it like having your own movie theater.I also used my DVD player's drive and USB port to run slide shows of digital photos, and can say that this set makes an extraordinary digital picture frame. For those times when one isn't actually watching moving content, one can use it to great advantage as an incredible picture display. Think seascape, forest scene, galaxies, etc. Even images as low in resolution as 800 by 600 looked fantastic. I spent many hours playing with that function, and rediscovered many older images and computer art experiments from days gone by.  I've lived in places with smaller windows than this, and it could easily be your window to whatever landscape or world you choose.I also tried it briefly as a computer monitor, and it does a good job there as well. I will do more testing with streamed video (from Amazon, of course - Netflix doesn't stream to Linux computers, and I use Linux at home), and update this review. I really look forward to streaming my digital content from Amazon when the broadband stuff gets sorted out.Bottom line is that the changes in the interface, hiding many functions behind the Google registration, poor remote design/function, and very poor documentation move this down from the 4 or 5 star review I was hoping to give it, to a 3 (actually a 3.5, if we could give those). Given my experience with LG monitors, I have to admit to some serious disappointment with many aspects of this set. LG is definitely going to get some some \"\"buyer's remorse\"\" from users who don't research this set thoroughly.If you like Android and similar phone interfaces, you will probably like this set. If you are really excited about Google TV, then this would probably be a good choice - I will know more when I can arrange to test the Google TV part. If you don't have a lot of video gear to connect, or only have HDMI gear, then this will probably work just fine for you.If, on the other hand, you have a lot of legacy video gear and/or prefer something more user-friendly, look at a different model - the 65LW6500 has very similar picture quality, is 10 inches larger, has no Google restrictions, better menus, and costs about the same. LG also has other 55 inch LCD sets you should check out. As a brand, I find their TVs and monitors to be among the best, which is why I am being so hard on this one. It doesn't match their usual standard in many ways.The picture quality outweighs many faults, and the Google TV stuff might make the difference for you. For me, I use Ixquick to search, and I can surf the web on a computer hooked to a monitor like this and have much more control, so the Google feature does not impress me. For the $1,000 difference, you can buy a similar sized non-Google LG set and also get a pretty decent computer as well.I'm not a gamer, so can't report on how well it works with game consoles.Initial tests with cable were not pleasant. The cable box had only composite and RF (channel 3) out, so the picture quality was not very good. Blowing up low quality SD video over an RF connection to this size is scary bad. (Think 160 by 120 pixel image blown up to full screen....) No device can scale up info that simply isn't there. You need HDMI (or DVI with adapter, or HD VGA) to take full advantage of this set's capabilities. RGB from my DVD player was also very good.Again, I will post more info and some pictures of the unboxing and inputs as I can.UPDATE:  January 2013I've now hooked up a small computer and wireless keyboard to run media files using this display. As a computer monitor, it is fantastic. I stream TV shows and movies from Amazon quite easily, and viewing multiple documents onscreen is fantastic. The problems with the interface still annoy, but once the computer signal is displayed, I don't need the remote for much of anything, so that is of less consequence.Using the computer to run slide shows of pictures works very well also.\"", "I still have high hopes for Google TV.  I have no idea why at this point... they just can't get it right.  Google TV was one of the primary reasons I chose this model.  I owned a Logitech Revue and a Vizio Co-Star and they ran like turds, but I thought it was just the hardware.  Well, Google TV has the same old problems on this TV, even though it is now first in line to get new updates.  The browser is still slow, internet speed tests show speeds that are MUCH slower than actual speeds achieved by other devices using the same cable.  There are still shockwave crashes when viewing videos at times.  It is the same ol' Google TV fails.  But I do like having it integrated with my TV instead of having a separate box like the Revue.I still give this TV five stars for the image and build quality.  If the Google TV developers can get their act together and fix the problems that have existed since Google TV first came out years ago, perhaps they can stop dragging down the quality and reputation of otherwise great devices like this.  I would consider purchasing one of the new 2013 models coming soon.", "\"Having played with this device for a month or so, I like it.  A lot.First, the pros:1) Google TV is actually a great built in operating system.  I haven't experienced any crashes, I liked the ease with which it updated its own firmware, and the tv's control panel is a really intuitive interface.2) An amazing picture.  Stunning.  Just remember to keep it orthogonal to sunshine and you'll be reliably glare free.3) The passive 3d thing is really nifty and easy on the eyes, and you can play with its settings to adjust how much depth is perceived - practically, this adjusts how out of sync the alternating lines in the picture are, but it works.4) Did I mention that it comes with just about every connective interface one could think of (except perhaps Thunderbolt - give that a few years and it may be in a successive generation).5) The remote was really easy to pair with the television once it connected to wifi.  Also, as an added bonus, you can download an app that turns your smart phone into another remote.A few cons:1) There are some ways in which the interface is not intuitive.  My particular gripe is that when you're watching regular TV, there's no on screen option to go straight to settings.  You have to go to the home page first.  This would not be so much of a problem except for the fact that the remote itself doesn't have a settings button.  Interestingly enough though, the downloadable Google TV  remote app actually does have its own settings button.  Weird.2) It's great that you move the mouse on screen by moving the remote itself in space, like a Wii controller, but it's not the most precise of tools, and it takes a *lot* of practice to learn how not to wield the remote in more than the most clumsy fashion.3) The TV's built in wifi receiver is really not that great, and I don't see why it couldn't have been made better.  We first had the TV in our living room, and it had a lot of trouble receiving a decent signal from our router, which is upstairs in our guest bedroom.  This is particularly problematic because the TV sometimes couldn't connect to wifi except after repeated attempts.  This problem went away when we moved the TV to our bedroom, but still, more flexibility here would have been good.4) The remote shows every indication of being proprietary - although I haven't tried it, I don't know how well a standard universal remote would work with the Google TV system, and in particular I don't know how many universal remotes come with built-in keyboards or motion sensing technology.  Of course, \"\"proprietary remote\"\" usually equals \"\"expensive to replace.\"\"5) The main drawback of LG's passive 3d technology is that it really plays 3d at 1080i rather than 1080p - that is, it staggers the horizontal lines so that each side of the glasses is only picking up every other line.  The main consequences is that you're only getting 540 lines of resolution rather than the full 1080.  I don't know how one would work around this, though, except maybe by creating a tv that really has 2160 horizontal lines squeezed into a 1080p aspect.  This may not come for a while but one never knows.6) Last and admittedly not that important - don't expect to be able to pick up broadcast TV without an antenna, but those are not necessarily that expensive.In sum, this is an amazing product.  Hopefully we won't get sucked into using it that often.  (Also, it would be nice if someone gave us a blu-ray player with 3d capability, but you can't have everything.)Please let me know if you find this helpful or if you have other questions.\"", "When we first received this tv, we were impressed with the delivery method which allowed it to be delivered without any issues of breaking or even damage to the box. We were scheduled to have it set up as that was part of the delivery option, but they did not do this. For us, that wasn't a big deal as we have always set up our own electronics in the past.Out of the box, the tv looks sleek and clean. The setup was fairly easy. The most difficult aspect was getting it connected to our wifi as it didn't originally want to connect. Eventually, it decided to connect, so we were able to try out some of the different apps offered with the tv. This is probably one of our favorite aspects of the tv as it allows us to watch things through Netflix right through the tv and not have to use the bluray player for this function. At first, the 3D option was not functional, but that has since been corrected with a firmware update. (If you want to be able to fully use all the functions on this tv, you will need high speed internet.)The remote is pretty cool with the traditional remote on one side and a keyboard on the other side. We have found it to be a bit glitchy at times. As in, it has lags or just doesn't want to function properly. It has a pointer (think computer mouse) that is not always easy to use. We pretty much have a love/hate relationship with the remote. When it works, it's wonderful. When it doesn't, it a royal pain.We've been using the tv for several months now as I wanted to give the company time to take care of the glitches prior to writing the review. I'm glad that I did as they have sent out updates to correct some of the main issues that we experienced when the tv first came out. For me, having a company actually sending out updates on products is very important.The picture quality isn't quite as good as some of the higher end tvs that are available now, but it's still quite good. You may or may not be able to have googletv fully functional depending on your cable/satellite provider. In our case, we have Dish which does not allow for their programming to be incorporated into the tv's googletv option.Overall, we like the tv and think (at the time of this review) that it's a good value for the money.", "\"**** Review UPDATE 7-12-2013  The G2 is still going strong after heavy daily usage. ZERO issues, no dead pixels, no turning itself off , no screen issues, etc. A good solid product!The LG 55G2 is a revolutionary product. Combining the very best of LG's well above average and mature software operating systems, top of the line IPS panel technology, attractive/futuristic styling and a knockout out version of Google TV powered by a powerful dual core processor, the LG G2 55 Inch Cinema 3D LED/LCD is an entertainment powerhouse!I couldn't wait to pop this out of the box and have a look. It is gorgeous and the 55 inch screen is just the right size to fully immerse yourself into a Blu Ray movie and especially a 3D movie.All my other LG's have been 47 inches and this is my first 55 inch screen.  It really is impressive to see it in action.  The brushed aluminum bezel and faux metal stand finish matches perfectly. It really does look cushty!The screen is semi glossy but not a mirror like a Plasma can be.  I watch in a semi darkened room and it looks fantastic.  The speakers are above average for a flat panel. Honestly though, if you spend this much on a TV I would hope you are planning to use at least a sound-bar and sub. But as it is the sound produced by the G2 is more than fine for everyday viewing.Featuring the very latest passive 3D technology for comfort and ease of use and a 1080p native panel resolution coupled with a 120hz refresh rate, you get outstanding video resolution that can easily make your TV shows , DVD's , Streaming Premium Services,  Blu Ray discs and media collection look their best while completely immersing you in the action. Staying home never looked so good!(And of course LG has included SIX pairs of passive 3D glasses so you can start watching 3D content right away!)The G2 will look and function equally as well mounted or using the included stand. The stand, while heavy plastic designed to resemble metal, is extremely easy to put together and is the most stable of any TV stand I have ever had. It went together quickly and is solid as a rock. I wish it could tilt forward a bit as well as from side to side, but otherwise I like it very much.  I am pushing 60 and with bad arthritis I was still able to unpack, set-up and place the television on my TV table by myself. A Phillips head screwdriver and a bit of patience and TLC are all that is needed. I had this TV out of the box and playing a Blu Ray disc in just about 45 minutes from start to finish.The actual on screen set-up went very quickly. You will need a Google account (they're free) so you can sign in and take advantage of many more features offered. I went ahead and set up the TV without signing in and everything went well.  You can use the included IR blaster to control your cable box/DVR with the G2 remote or you can use your Harmony to do it the way you are used to. You have MANY options for controlling this beastie!For those of you used to previous LG models or even the newest models, you will soon notice that accessing the picture adjustment menus (or any other menu) is not quite as fast as before. You need to hit the \"\"home\"\" button on the remote and then point and click on the tool icon next to the input you are currently viewing. From there you get multiple menus that include sub menus. Once you get to the main menu you wish, scrolling up and down is easy, selecting your settings is quick (press and hold to drag settings icons) and if you get lost just press \"\"back\"\" to get back to the previous page.  If you are at all computer savvy this process will be 2nd nature and a joy to use. For people of a certain age it may prove a bit more challenging.The best thing to do is give yourself a nice long tour of the software interfaces to get acquainted with things. This could take quite a long time, depending on how much you wish to know, as the menus and options are seemingly endless up to a point. I love it myself. You can pretty much bend this device to your will and customize things the way you want them to be.  Again, if you are not tech savvy, this is probably not the TV for you but if you were raised on computers you will love it.I have recently written a few reviews about various new generation LG TV models I currently own and because many features are common to the latest software and display technology used here, I will paraphrase certain portions of my previous reviews when they apply to the very impressive 55G2.But with that said, the 55G2 is virtually in a class by itself and here are some reasons why:No amount of software or bells and whistles will substitute for a great picture. So HOW IS the picture quality on the G2?  I had read an early review on CNET that seemed dire. I was NOT expecting much but after powering up and inputting my calibrated settings I use with my LG 7600 the screen came alive with POP and Crisp Clear Fine detail! I was starting to rock and roll! OH YEAH!!!The 55G2 incorporates the very best of LG's combined tech of the last 5 years with unique software interfaces controlling new and exciting home entertainment functionality that takes watching TV and home theater entertainment in general to the next level and beyond. WAY beyond!  Take the G2 and add a 3D Blu Ray Player such as the LG BD670 3D Wireless Network Blu-ray Disc Player with Smart TV and a surround audio system and you will never run out of things to watch or do.Watching regular TV, both High Definition broadcasts and recordings from your HD DVR or SD content, the results are simply wonderful.  For some folks, that would be enough, but that is just barely scratching the surface.  The G2 55 also functions as a full functioning HD media player that can stream from local attached media such as your USB sticks or drives , wireless from your smart phone or laptop/MAC/PC , or any number of premium services. Just feel like surfing the web and updating your facebook status? NO problem. A full functioning Google Chrome browser is ready for your command. And by command I don't just mean typing in the web address with the included Qwerty keyboard remote, but VOICE command as well. Just tell your remote where you want to go online and it will go there.  (yes you read that correctly) Honestly, the LG 55 G2 would fit right into The Jetson's living room.The panel itself is indistinguishable from both the new LG 6700 or 6200. In fact, the only real difference between this panel and my 7600 is the refresh rate. The G2 is 120hz and the 7600 is 240hz but in reality achieves the 240hz with a strobing backlight and is in fact a 120hz panel just like the G2!  If you have seen or read about ANY of those displays, then you can apply that to the G2 as the end result is almost identical.  Same goes for the included video processing but since the G2 does it's math with the aide of a dual core chip, it is even BETTER than my 7600.  Honestly folks, I can SEE and appreciate the difference. I was not quite prepared for how GREAT this TV actually performs.  This is television ON STERIODS!Speaking of the Dual Core processor, this allows the G2 to process your video at a much faster rate, resulting in glitchless video. Streaming Netflix has never been better and in fact ALL the premium content I viewed looked absolutely fabulous. (a lot depends on your web speed, I am using FIOS at their highest)  I prefer a wired connection and have attached an Ethernet cable as an added precaution against stuttering video, but I HAVE tested the G2 with it's wireless connection and watched 'Shutter Island' from Netflix in perfect clarity and motion with minimal loading time. COOL!  I can not say the same for my 7600 which sports only the single core which it shares for all processing chores simultaneously. The G2 is definitely the processing power winner here!About the ONLY two downsides I can see in the G2 is like both the LG 6200 and 6700 the G2 does NOT include control over Tru Motion at this time,. This MAY be addressed in a future firmware update but as it is the option is not there. Also, like the 6200 the G2 does NOT include LED Plus Local Dimming. The LG 6700 and above gives you that and of course the 9700 will give you a full array local dimming panel. (costing twice as much though) None of those two things are hampering my enjoyment of the TV.  I watched the 3D X-Games sampler on ESPN 3D and it rocked with no motion blur. I also watched a recording from my HD DVR of last weeks Indy 500 and again, no blurring. As for the local dimming, even on my 7600 I have it set to LOW and have noticed it introduces it's own set of visual artifacts when used. Basically if you set your contrast and brightness and backlight correctly (MORE info on that in the comments section) you can extract a very very good picture out of the G2.Streaming a 1080p MKV from local media is also a seamless experience. The G2 can handle data rates from your local attached media up to 20 gigabits per second without a single hiccup or unwanted artifact and output up to Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1 core from the optical output.If by any chance you collect and watch PAL video content (I have a large collection of British PAL titles) the G2 will allow PAL to be displayed at 50hz as long as you first upconvert it to 720p or higher.No frame conversion is necessary and PAL video renders beautifully on this LG.TO TRY and keep this review at a manageable length I have included more info on the comments section. Tips for calibrating this display along with observations and comments about flash lighting and other anomalies are covered. Check it out of you want to know even more! (click \"\"comments\"\" at the bottom of this review to see my post)The LG 55G2 (or 47) has exceeded my expectations and is totally set up to be the hub of your entire entertainment center. Content is endless with more to be added thru the app store and firmware updates.  Picture quality is excellent for an edge lit LCD/LED and performance is fast and snappy.  The whole package is wrapped up in a beautiful modern looking package that will look good in almost any room.  This is an excellent Goggle TV system and a great HDTV as well.  If you added up all the individual components that the G2 replaces and then add a good 55 inch LED/LCD, the price would be much more than the 2100 the G2 currently sells for. The integration of software and hardware here is well thought out and works seamlessly. Sure, there is always room for improvement, but LG has made a great start here and they do test their software extensively before releasing it which is a HUGE plus for a product like this!Highly Recommended!\"", "This TV is spectacular. I just love the slick appearance and the huge shiny cinema-quality screen. Setup was easy. It took 2 people to move it, and 2 people assemble the stand. It was delivered the same day and delivery was hassle-free.  Once the stand is on, it's a simple matter to setup internet and cable. I just connected the cords to my router and to my cable jack. I was online in no time and was instantly able to check several online sites including HBO, and the Cartoon network.The LG  has a slick online interface that allows you to easily utilize different features on the web, as well as to preview 3d videos. Most of the features functioned as expected with exception of an applet called 3d-world which simply did not load. (I did contact tech support and will let you know if there is an answer).I must admit my home cable TV quality is not that great, and this screen will make any cable deficiencies glaringly obvious, so if you buy a TV this size, make sure you have a good TV package to go with it, if you intend to use cable. I don't actually watch a lot of TV- my primary interest is in movies and DVDs, and for that purpose this set will shine. I was able to see the high quality though, through the Netflix applet. I downloaded Iron Man 2, and the sound and the picture were crisp and clear and oh-so-awesome. I'm probably going to renew my Netflix subscription to watch more filmsNow that I've told you all the awesome, I do need to mention a few of the problems I had with the LG's documentation and secondary devices and software.I've learned through trial and error, that the LG remote is sensitive to my wifi signal, and also needed to be synced to use the QWERTY keyboard feature. It took me half an hour of struggling to discover that. If you have this problem, like I did, the button you want to use, is the POINTER button on the front side in between the back button and menu button. Depressing that will enable the keyboard feature on your remote.The LG website is pretty bad. I'm sorry, but the documentation directs you to use it, but it is basically empty, it is tough to navigate, and support documentation is difficult to find if non-existent. I did use the CD which comes with a nice PDF. Thank goodness, and read the entire manual- but documentation for android features isn't that great, and you can't register the device online since it doesn't appear in their database yet.Finally, the applets. I couldn't get 3d world, one of the main applets to play at all. Since it hogs up a large amount of space on the home screen, this was disappointing.  I hope  LG will provide an update. It lets me select an applet, but it never loads. The documentation doesn't have any tips to help solve this problem. Dissapointing!Overall, despite a few bugs, this great large-screen TV. The sound and crisp picture is high quality.PROS1. A large 55-inch screen with clear picture2. Easy to setup and use3. Nice entertainment features and applets4. Easy to plug-in extra devices5. Built in support for netflix and several other cool apps6. Web loads quickly and easily7.  The sound, the picture, the experience! oh my!! Wonderful!CONS1. The remote was a bit too sensitive for my taste, and has some conflicts with my wifi2. KWERTY keyboard is too tiny for me3. Base drilled slightly crooked (noticed during assembly but overall did not harm anything)4. 3d-world does not load5. Poor documentation for all included features6. LG website unhelpful7. TV may not be suited for average cable package because of screen size. (some shows appear grainy and slightly distorted).", "\"Well let me start off this review by stating that this is my very first ever Hi-Def LED Flat Screen TV and I couldn't be more tickled if I had a feather... Well you know what I mean! So I read some of the reviews already posted and found them to be very informative, yet a bit too technical for my taste, although admittedly there needs to be some tech stuff included with the review in order to help assist other potential customers with any issues that may come up. So I will try desperately to stay away from that except in such instances where it may be necessary and focus more on the simple, and in some cases, not so simple steps I went through to set this TV up from delivery to its current status. So without further delay, here we go...DELIVERYI received what the call \"\"White Glove\"\" delivery where the delivery people come into your home, set up the TV, make sure it all functions properly and then carts off the box and all related packing material. Really a cool thing, but admittedly I didn't use it because I wasn't going to be home when it was delivered and instead had it delivered to my local post office. So in theory it was great and I am sure had I actually been home it would have went off without a hitch. Then again maybe they would have dropped it! I guess we will never know.INITIAL SET-UPI cheated here and had local box store and their famous or perhaps infamous \"\"Geek Squad\"\" come in and do the initial set-up of my TV and my newSony BDP-BX58 Blu-ray Disc Player 3D Built-in Wireless, as well as, hooking up my 25+ year old Pioneer system component stereo system that I originally purchased way back in the mid-80's and which still works better today than most new systems. Why you may be asking? Simply put, if they put it together and break it they have to pay for it. If I put it together and break it then I have to pay for it. Much better to spend a couple of bucks and let them take all the risks.Admittedly they got everything hooked up correctly utilizing a six-footInfiGear Ultra Series High Speed HDMI Cableand a ten-footInfiGear Ultra Series High Speed HDMI Cable, which due to the position of the TV in relation to the other equipment and the entertainment center made in virtually impossible to use the shorter three-foot cable by InfiGear.Initial set-up went basically smoothly without a hitch until it came time to hook up the WI-FI connection. That's when things took a dramatic turn to the P.I.T.A. factor and had not only me but the service people frustrated as well. What we found out after several frustrating attempts at connecting the WI-FI was that the comupter modem was not adequate enough and I had to purchase a newer more updated model along with a new router, of which I finally chose theNetgear WNDR4000 N750 Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Routeras it was fully capable of handling the TV and the computer simultaneously with no worries about interference on either end. This of course didn't happen until the following day when I was able to purchase one locally and come back and get everything installed and updated.MY CONTRIBUTIONSOkay, once I got the modem and router issue solved, and a few bucks okay quite a few bucks lighter in my wallet, I hooked everything up and got the WI-FI connected and instantly had to download updates not only to the TV, but also to the Blu-Ray player. No big deal really and everything updated after a few minutes and worked well with no real issues. Now the great thing here is that I have Smart TV access not only through the TV now, but also through the Blu-Ray player, so I can choose which method of WI-FI access I want to use. If something isn't readily available through the TV, you can bet it is through the Blu-Ray player. Both of which offer access to certain applications such as Netflix, while one offers access to some applications while the other doesn't. It may sound a bit confusing but it really isn't. Think of it as having two different browsers on your computer.HOW DOES IT WORKOkay, this is the real \"\"meat and potatoes\"\" of this review, \"\"How does it work?\"\" Well let me tell you that after getting everything hooked up, updated, adjusted, and sorted out, this is the best TV I have ever owned, and I owned ones that you had to actually get up off the couch, walk over and turn the dial to get the two an maybe three channels that were available to you, so I speak from a long experience of televisions, although admittedly like I said earlier this is my first Hi-Def LED flat screen that I have ever owned.Now I had to make a few adjustments to the picture and sound quality and that was all easily done with the very user friendly remote, okay well it is user friendly if you first read the instructions, which as we all know guys usually don't do at all, but women do. So I guess they are good for something. Easy ladies, I was just kidding! Anyhow, I easily adjusted the picture quality so that it works just great for my satellite picture as well as for my Blu-Ray player. The picture quality is simply amazing and I am still blown away by it and I have been watching it for several weeks now. The sound also was quite surprising as I really don't have to use my old Pioneer sound system to get good quality sound and have so far just used the speakers built into the TV itself. Yes, I did try out the Pioneer system, but I have a fairly small front room where the TV is located an it was really a bit too much for the space available. The TV speakers work just fine for now and I see no reason to change it. The adjustments were simply a matter of trying each setting and comparing them against the others until I found the settings that worked just right for me. Very pleased with them!I have found no issues so far with this TV and have been watching regular satellite television this past several weeks along with the following DVD's, guess which one I watched first and have had no issues whatsoever. Well I guess I have had one issue, but it isn't with the TV, but with the signal coming from my DirecTV, and that has been the occasional digitizing of the picture. Doesn't happen at all with the Blu-Ray player so it isn't a HDMI cable issue, only with the satellite signal. Doesn't happen often and when it does it is only for a moment. Guess I will have to put in a call to customer service if it continues.Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)Captain America: The First Avenger (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)REMOTE CONTROLSThe TV remote and the Blu-Ray player remote both work fine at the moment and it was fairly easy to sync them up with my DirecTV remote. However, I don't like the idea of having to have several remotes lying around and so I purchased theLogitech Harmony One Universal Remote with Color Touchscreenin order to avoid this problem and have one remote to work with. It has been several weeks and still isn't working properly. Now I can't as of yet entirely blame the remote as I put my girlfriend in charge of getting it all updated and set-up. Perhaps that was a mistake, I don't know. All I know for sure is that I spent darn near two-hundred dollars on it and I still haven't been able to use it. I am getting frustrated and may have to reassign the task to myself in order to get it updated and working.3-DI am not a fan of the 3-D format and therefore can not give you an unbiased opinion on it. I will however say that it does work fine on this TV and if you are interested in it you won't be disappointed.So is this TV worth purchasing? I would have to definitely say that it was and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a flat screen TV.Shawn Kovacich100% Movie LoverAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.\"", "\"When I first looked at this I was thinking that 55\"\" is not too bad.  Hmm...........lets just say for a small room this is huge.  My living room is roughly 12x16 so yes it does make a large presense.  It is beautiful though and I'm quite happy now that hubby has it wall mounted using the Cheetah wall mount that Amazon sells.The color on this tv is better than wonderful especially when watching nature programs or the beloved cooking shows.  Let me tell you that see some of the dishes made on the cooking shows makes you really drool and want to just grab and eat.  Can't wait for football season now as that will be the real test.The set up was easy enough though you do need to have a google account in order to do anything with this right from the first get go.  I think this was my one major drawback so far to this particular tv.I absolutely love the smart tv feature as it adjusts to the lighting in the room which makes it easier on me where I tend to get headaches from too bright of lighting.  So far no headaches but the real test like I stated above will be during football season with all the action and flickering of the lighting.I would have liked to have had another foot or so on the power cord which would have made it easier for it to go directly to the power outlet.  We had to plug it into a surge protector since it wouldn't reach.  This is probably better anyway because our house was built in the 1800's and we do need to update the electrical.  We have some problem with spikes and surges to it's probably for the best to have it on a strip.The directions do need to be a little more specific but they're not that bad.  Everything is pretty much color coded which is one of the smartest things the tv industry has done to dat.Another gripe I have is with the Qwerty remote.  The keyboard is very small and the letter is not all that great especially for someone who wears glasses.  I needed to use a magnifying glass to help out with my glasses in order to read the letters and figure out how to use the symbols.  When I went to sync it it didn't get as precise as I would have liked so it does tend to be a bit annoying but other than that it does work wonderfully.The 3D feature seems to have captured hubby and my youngest daughter.  I went in the other day and here they sat with their glasses on watching whale wars and both thought it was awesome.  Yes we watch a tone of nature shows in this house.  They are going to watch Avatar again this weekend in the 3D to see how it compared to watching it at the theater.I have checked out some of the google tv aspects but not to a good enough extent to give you a good enough opinion on it.  I like to make sure that I have done my homework to the best of my ability before handing in the final verdict on each feature.All in all I would recommend this as LG does make the best of tv's in my opinion.  It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00013401760952547193, 0.00046970165567472577, 0.00011323653598083183, 0.3892688453197479, 0.02072967030107975, 0.00027775991475209594, 0.18552598357200623, 0.0010556788183748722, 0.00012016353866783902, 0.09469129890203476, 0.3029167354106903, 0.004320432897657156, 0.0003765840665437281]]}
