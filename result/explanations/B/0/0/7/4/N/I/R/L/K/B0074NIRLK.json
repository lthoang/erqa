"], "reviews": ["These K-cups are different than others - they actually look like a plastic lid with a sealed coffee filter.  They are half as long as a regular K-cup and accordingly, take up less space. In theory, I found these very appealing.The execution is not as impressive.First, this coffee is VERY bitter to me.  I drink Donut Shop, Hazelnut, and other light to medium flavors, and this is like a burnt dark roast. Two visitors also confirmed this for me (I wanted to make sure I wasn't being biased).Second, the soft pouch containing the coffee makes a much bigger mess in the K-cup brewer than the regular, rigid K-cups. I have to wipe the K-cup holder out each time, and it is much more drippy when done.Overall, neat idea, but poorly executed.", "This coffee was for my wife who drinks several cups of coffee every day.  She uses these pods in Keurig B30 Mini and she &#34;loves the smooth roasty flavor&#34;.  For ~60 cents a cup it seems like a reasonable deal.", "for me, i have never found any Keurig pod as good as any regular drip coffee.  on the positive side, this pod gives a good strong brew when set on 6 oz., but it has a very slightly bitter & sour aftertaste.  also, the design of this pod bottom being open on some of the pods, a little coffee sprays out rather than in one steady drip.", "Ever since we got our Keuric coffee maker, we've used Starbucks breakfast brew for mornings and Gevalia after dinner.When I first got married Hills Brothers and Maxwell were coffee of choice for almost everyone, so when I saw this HIlls Brother gourmet brand I had to give it a try. I truthfully didn't think it would compare with today's fancy blends, but was in for a big surprise. It not only tasted as good, it smelled better while brewing. Imagine that!The little cups fit the Keuric perfectly too.Highly recommended; an old familiar brand we can trust.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 9, 2014Author of &#34;1106 Grand Boulevard&#34;", "My wife is the coffee drinker in the family so I got this for her and solicited her comments.  She liked it.  As she said it is a good middle of the road coffee that most coffee drinkers will probably enjoy. It is strong enough for the avid early morning coffee drinker but not bitter or overpowering.  Most people will like it.", "This coffee has a good flavor. It's not especially strong. I suggest using the medium cup setting on your Keurig. On the full cup, the flavor is diluted too much.The drawback is the cups cannot be stored in the K-cup carousel, because they are not solid plastic. Instead they are a mesh netting, open somewhat, and need to remain in the stay-fresh pouch inside the box.", "This is delicious coffee. It's got pretty rich flavor on my Keurig's larger cup setting, and isn't too bitter.These aren't the cheapest K-cups, but the flavor and aroma are very nice. The cups themselves have a hard plastic top, but the part that contains the coffee is a fine paper fabric -- like a coffee filter. This results in less waste, but you have to keep the cups in the sealed bag to keep them fresh.My cups arrived in a bag with an expiration date that was about 7.5 months in the future, which suggests to me that we can rely on these cups to be quite fresh. 4 stars for good flavor but slightly higher price and the need to keep them wrapped (I also have a refillable K-cup, which generates no waste, so the 'less waste' cups here aren't really a positive selling point for me).", "If you're looking for a good, basic cup of coffee then this is a pretty good bet. My mother snapped this up almost as soon as I received it, as she was familiar with the coffee brand. I suppose it's a good sign when you have a box of coffee vanishing before your eyes and getting consumed at a fairly quick pace.The taste here is very nice and while it's pretty much your standard cup of coffee, it's still better than the stuff we have in my office at work when we run out of K-cup coffees. It's not a particularly sharp taste, but then I like my coffee to have a lighter, softer flavor than the darker blends that exist out there.I also really love that this has a soft filter bottom rather than the full K-cup plastic. I'll admit that while I love my brewer, I do feel somewhat guilty at the amount of waste it produces, so this is a nice alternative. All in all, I'll probably end up purchasing these with my own money in the future.", "I found this coffee blend to have a bit of a bitter aftertaste; however, my husband didn't detect that and he thought it was a decent Colombian.  I don't care for the soft-bottomed k-cups; as they won't fit in our K-Cup Dispenser.  We like to keep our k-cups handy next to our brewer, and you can't do that with this style.  No doubt these are more economical to buy than the standard K-cup packages; but it is necessary to keep them sealed in their airtight bags to maintain freshness.", "\"These come shipped in a foil bag inside a regular k-cup box.  The reason being - there is an exposed filter at the bottom of these pods thus making you enjoy a more flavorful coffee.  The only downside to this packaging is if you accidentally rip the bag, then you'll have to find a sealed coffee canister to put them in so they do not go stale.The coffee itself is good - it isn't weak even on the largest mug setting on the Keurig.  It's not my absolute favorite coffee, that would be Caribou.  But, this is a very close second with just the right amount of \"\"kick\"\" to start the mornings, and doesn't have an overly burned flavor.  It's smooth, very easy to drink to the point that if you didn't have the make these individually, you would drink the entire pot without realizing it.  I don't think, however, that there is a true Columbian flavor to this coffee, but it is very good, and isn't weak at all.  It's about right in my opinion.  I do love the fresh coffee experience with the design of these K-cups, however, and this will make the coffee pods last longer than the traditional all plastic ones that most of these K-cups come in.  Recommend!\"", "This coffee is fine, okay, not great, not bad and whatever other synonyms exist for &#34;just ok.&#34;  I have gotten in the habit of expecting more from my k-cup coffee than ok.  This might cost a dollar or two less than Starbucks, but I think that dollar is well worth the expense for Starbucks or other quality k-cup coffee.  I'll drink this and won't mind it, but I don't expect to choose it again.", "I am just finishing my first morning cup and have to say it tastes just fine.  It has a slight bit more acid zing to it but nothing at all to object to.  In fact I am on the way to the kitchen for my second cup of the morning.  I would have no hesitation in buying this coffee or enjoying this roast.", "Since I received a Keurig for Christmas a year and half ago, part of the fun of ownership is experimenting with various coffees as we decide which we enjoy. This particular Hills Bros. variety ranks toward the top. It is quite smooth with no bitter aftertaste and for my own preference is just about perfect in strength. I like the open filter bottom style although it does require air tight storage. The package comes with a zip lock bag intended to keep the coffee fresh but it tore easily and I stored the k-cups in a glass jar with a screw on lid to keep it fresh.I feel that the single serve Hills Bros. Coffee is a good value for those who own coffee makers using k-cups.", "My husband loves this coffee. It has amazing flavor. And the medium roast has just the right about of strength.", "Both my wife and I found this coffee to be somewhat bitter tasting,  We tried making coffee using both tap water and bottled water and used the small, mdium and large cup settings and the bitter tasting reults were the same.  Also frustrating was the top design of the single serve packet.  Even though the box said it is k-cup ready, the top of the packet gets caught in the coffee maker and you have to pull it free.  The bottom design of the packet is nice as it allows the Kurig Coffee maker to run the heated water through the entire tea-bag style filter rather than just a poked hole in the bottom of a k-cup. If the coffee wasn't so bitter and the top didn't get stuck, this product would be nice... the filter design is great.  Also nice is the sealing design of the inner package.  That was something you don't get with the regulat k-cups and we thing it provides a fresher storage of the coffee packets.  Overall we didn't like it because of the bitter taste and the sticking factor..", "I picked Hills Coffee K-Cups because I love my cup of coffee in the morning and can always use more K-Cups.  The first thing I noticed was that the coffee grounds are held in a paper-like filter rather than plastic.  That threw me off but the box said that the K-Cups are compatible with all K-Cup machines so I went ahead and brewed a cup of coffee in my Hamilton Beach Coffee Brewer.  Or at least I tried to make a cup of coffee - while the top of my K-Cup was punctured, all I got was a cup of hot water.  After thinking it over, I ended up cutting the filter, placing the coffee grounds in my coffee maker filter, and made a cup of coffee that way (my coffee brewer works with both K-Cups and regular coffee grounds).  While I was a bit worried that coffee grounds would end up in my coffee cup to my delight they didn't.As for the coffee itself - it is quite good.  I like my coffee on the mild side and it tasted just the way I like it.  I tried this coffee in both my travel blog (the larger size tends to dilute the coffee) and a regular coffee mug (which can be too strong for my taste).  I liked the coffee both ways with no preference for either way.  In fact, if it weren't for the design of the K-Cups this would be on my list of must have coffees, but it is not compatible with my coffee maker and I really don't want to cut open the cake cups every time I want a quick cup of coffee.", "This makes a very good cup of coffee. It's not too strong for me, but it is a little bit stronger than some medium roast coffees, in my opinion. But, it has a rich, full flavor that you would expect from a medium roast. I do like how the company cuts back on plastic usage and sells their K-Cups in much smaller cups. I found the smaller cups didn't cut down on the strength and flavor and that it was still a good, full cup of coffee. The side of the box says 'no fancy flavors, just good coffee'. I agree that it is very good coffee, but I like flavored coffee as well. It would be nice to have some flavored coffee from this company in the future. But, I would definitely recommend this Colombian Medium Roast blend. Very good.", "I love my single serving of coffee and I am always on the look out for a different taste to add to my collection of pods. This is a great roast. Not too strong and not too mild but just right. This is a slightly different type of pod because it is not a hard plastic shell but a filter. It does come with a resealable bag for the coffee pods. I love the fact that you get that pre-brewed coffee smell. I have now added these pods on to my subscribe and save order for my coffee moments.", "I liked this coffee, but it didn't blow my socks off.  I didn't find this kcup to be any better or any worst than any other k cup that I have used.  Over all it was good.  But basic.", "This coffee is well balanced and smooth with low acidity.  I don't have any complaints about the flavor, but it's very standard.  There's nothing complex or rich or nuanced about the flavor.  I imagine this coffee would appeal to a broad range of people, though it won't &#34;wow&#34; anyone with its flavor.  Perhaps this would be best for an office coffee bar that calls for a non-offensive coffee that everyone can drink.  For home use, I prefer to go with something more robust and interesting.", "I liked this coffee.  It was smooth and tasty.  Just finishing up the box.  These cup have a coffee filter type bottom and plastic top.  I believe that this cuts down on the plastic used.  They work well except for occasionally getting stuck in the top of the brewer when you open it.  Maybe &#34;stuck&#34; is the wrong word ... they get caught on the top and you have to pull it out.  Not a big deal but worth mentioning.", "This coffee is a mainstream American style medium roast coffee. It shouldn't be overlooked because of this, because it offers a full bodied, slightly acidic cup that is surprisingly good. I have not drunk Hills Bros coffee in a very long time, but I can say that it has a better flavor than other common supermarket brands, notably Folgers and Maxwell House.The coffee capsules themselves come packed in a resealable foil bag. They are not the typical plastic k-cup. Instead they are made the same way as San Francisco Coffee Company capsules. A plastic ring with a filter bottom and a foil lid (which is why they come in a resealable pouch). The San Francisco capsules use a biodegradable plastic; these do not. It is debatable whether there is less plastic waste as a result of the way they are made.I have tried a lot of different k-cups. I prefer a dark roast coffee because I like a fuller bodied cup, but I find that Hill Bros is quite good, albeit without the trace of smokiness that a dark roast has. Worth trying if you like a medium roast.", "Had a cup of this this afternoon and it's delish.  Not quite strong as I like it but good coffee nevertheless.", "These cups are a bit odd.  I was a bit worried that I either had to go find the blank Keurig cartridge thing OR that if I used it without that thing that it would explode in the chamber because the bottom of this is like a tea bag material.  However, I did just pop it in like any other K cup and it was fine.The taste is very decent for the Colombian.  Nice and strong and smooth.  I easily can have this for wake up coffee.  lol - that;s always my qualifier for good coffee - can I have this when I wake up?The other thing that I want to mention - because K cups - in general are really expensive - they are a luxury for me - I always run them through twice, sometimes three times in a row - within the same hour - not the next day.  I find that the taste gets a little weaker each time and I am okay with that, especially because I remind myself I am dollar cost averaging.  The cost of a cup goes from maybe 90 cents a use to 30 cents a use - and that still costs a lot - but at least it is less than having three new pods.  I also lower the water each time - so the first run gets a full cup, next is a 2/3 cup, and a little bit less of a pull for cup number three on the same pod.And, I am happy to report that you can pull the Hills Bro weirdo  K cup for three good pulls and it doesn't fall apart!I guess in the end these cups are a bit more environmentally friendly because they have a lot less plastic.  And that's a good thing.", "I like coffee, strong, black and tasting like coffee.  The box advertises &#34;No fancy flavors, just great coffee.&#34;  For me, &#34;great&#34; might be an overstatement but this coffee does have quite a bit of good, basic coffee flavor.  I used the small cup setting on my Keurig to make the most of it and I have to say I was pleased with the result.My only issue is with storage.  These K-cups are the kind that have to be kept inside a tightly sealed foil bag because the business end of the cup is netting.  This means I can't put them in my revolving K-Cup rack, without having them go stale quickly.  If I leave them in the pantry with the rest of the K-cup overflow, they'll never get used, so I guess they will reside in their little foil bag behind the Keurig.  On the bright side, they are  more compact, with less plastic packaging to discard.", "So I was concerned when I realized they weren't regular k-cups. But once I realized they'd work in a regular k-cup machine, I LOVE THEM! Way less waste than a regular k-cup, which makes me feel a bit less guilty about this easy coffee shortcut (and way around crappy office coffee pot coffee). Be careful when you take out the pod, though - because there is no plastic on the bottom, it will be hot where the grounds are, so just grab the top area so you don't get burned.Oh, and the coffee also tastes great! Rich and smooth with no weird aftertaste. I will definitely buy this again. I love these 'less waste' cups!", "My husband is a coffee junkie.  I'm the one who buys it for him.  With that being said - He says this blend is a bit weak.  He liked it better when he blended it with a darker coffee but says that even for a Medium Roast coffee it's not strong enough.  However, if we find a blend in this line that he likes I'd definitely buy it!  The price with the Subscribe and Save discount is great!", "This tastes like HIlls Brothers Coffee.  It is a medium roast with not a whole lot of flavor.  It is not bad if you just want a simple cup of coffee.  I would rate it higher but I like a little more flavor and richness to my coffee.  It works great in my Kerug.", "I like my Keurig coffee maker, but the truth is it produces a lot of plastic waste with regular K-cups, This coffee is different, combining a mesh filter with minimal plastic.The coffee is tasty, a nice medium roast with minimal acidity. It comes in a resealable foil bag and you should keep the cups in there since they expose the coffee to air - unlike regular K-cups.", "A nice mellow, reliable coffee flavor with this one.  I tried it straight, with cream, and blended with a smaller percentage of one of my recent regulars.  I wanted more immediately.", "I haven't tried much Hills Bros. Coffee over the years, so it was a most pleasant surprise. This Hills Bros. Coffee Gourmet Medium Roast blend is among the best I have tried making coffee with coffee maker machines. Was pleasantly surprised by the rich aroma and fine taste, which I have to attribute to using medium roasted coffee beans. I highly recommend it.", "They make for tasty cups of coffee on the go, black or with a sweetener of your choice.
