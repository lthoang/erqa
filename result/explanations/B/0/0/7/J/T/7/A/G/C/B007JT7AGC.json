"], "reviews": ["I'm a fan of Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree line because of the cooling sensation which is the reason that I was drawn to this shampoo. While I was shampooing my hair, I didn't feel the cool tingling that I was expecting, however when I starting rinsing the shampoo out of my hair I started to feel it. It is heavenly, as is the scent! Because it is marketed for men (I'm a woman), I was surprised at how soft and conditioned my hair feels. After using this for 3 weeks, my husband (who has always used Head & Shoulders) said he now prefers this shampoo. We will definitely purchase this in the future.", "\"I got this for my boys and although they really do not have a dandruff issue, they said this shampoo \"\"does the job\"\". It cleans well, feels nice when used, and they really enjoyed the cooling sensation afterwards. Best of all the hair looks good later!\"", "I'll admit, I didn't have a dandruff problem when I first got this product.  In fact, I never have.  I had snatched up some of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner mainly because I needed some shampoo and I'm not tied to any particular kind, so I was willing to give anything a try.  Then I decided to get this one since I'm a fan of the Cool Sport Mint smell.  I have a problem though.  I now have dandruff.  This is very strange, especially since this product is specifically supposed to combat against this particular problem.  Now, after a month of using this product I have a drier scalp than I ever have and my hair is actually oily, which is a common problem I have always had, but now it's worse than ever and I can only point a finger at this product since it is all that has changed in my hygiene regimen.  It appears that this isn't the norm for the majority of reviewers here (although I see that Enna Isilee had a similar experience to mine).  Maybe it's not dandruff.  Maybe it's residue from the shampoo itself that doesn't rinse out of your hair, but either way, this is distressing and irritating since this has never been a problem for me before.  I'll be buying a different bottle of shampoo and throwing this one in the trash.  I did, however, enjoy the smell of the shampoo.", "The consensus in our household of dandruff shampoo users is that this is a pretty good shampoo. The smell was just ok and the consistency of the shampoo is a little runny. But, it worked well to control dandruff and the cool mint made the scalp tingle after shampooing. It's a large bottle that should last quite awhile.", "\"The active ingredient in this dandruff shampoo is zinc pyrithione.  The most commonly known shampoo with this anti-dandruff ingredient would be Head and Shoulders.  Personally, I have never found Head and Shoulders to be very effective, preferring Selsun Blue.  As far as the Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo, while it does have a pleasant mint scent and feels good while shampooing.....the results seem about the same as Head and Shoulders.So, if Head and Shoulders works for you, but you want a change as far as a nicer scent, give this a try.  If Head and Shoulders has been ineffective for you, this product probably would not help either. I am not saying this product does not work, simply that since it is based on zinc pyrithione, if that works for you in another product, this should too, but if you haven't had success with this compound in another shampoo, it is doubtful you'd find this shampoo effective.This product does have Vitamin E in it also, which should help moisturize a dry, itchy scalp.Overall, a decent shampoo, a few \"\"botanical\"\" ingredients, nice scent, and it will work fine for some people.\"", "Even though this is a shampoo for men I decided to give it a try. The shampoo on my head felt great, it had that cooling effect some mint shampoos and soaps have, yet the scent wasn't overpowering. Since it was a hot day, August in New Orleans, duh, the cooling mint felt really good on my head.The shampoo isn't harsh, it didn't strip my hair and make it feel dry, just very clean and slightly tingly, not an unpleasant tingle or burn, just a nice soothing cooling tingle. I tried the conditioner and liked it, I think this is a great brand.", "Over the counter low-priced dandruff shampoo is pretty much over the counter low-priced dandruff shampoo. We have tried many different flavors and varieties and they all, basically, work the same. The thing that sets the shampoo apart, for me, from other shampoos is the fragrance. I love the way this shampoo smells, and I love the way my husband smells when he gets out of the shower after using it!! Who knew minty fresh wasn't just for your breath? :-)", "\"This may be designed for men but women can use it, too!  This is my third Clear shampoo I've tried now this week and I must say they all provide excellent cleansing of the hair in a way that doesn't add frizz or dullness, itchiness or stickiness to the hair and scalp.The shampoo does come out looking like school glue, but it lathers fast.  It's not too minty at all, and just like the other Clear Shampoos, combing the hair afterwards is easy.My hair remains \"\"clean-looking\"\" a good 12 hours longer than normal with this product, but once again the price is a tad steep.\"", "My Husband has moderate dandruff that causes extreme itching and uses Head & Shoulders for everyday use with a once weekly use of over the counter Nizoral. This combination keeps his dandruff away and makes it to where he does not have to worry about it. We decided to try the Clear Men Anti-Dandruff shampoo in place of his Head & Shoulders since I have had a good experience with Clear.The first thing I noticed is that Clear and Head & Shoulders have the exact same active ingredient in the same strength (pyrithione zinc). So, I knew that I would really come down to whether or not my Husband liked the feel of the shampoo and how it cleaned his hair. Let's just say that he has not used anything other than Clear Men Anti-Dandruff since he first got it. He really loves the way in feels on his scalp. It has a minty tingly feeling that leaves your hair and scalp feeling fresh and keeps it from itching. He also loves the way it makes his hair feel clean and soft. I tried the shampoo one day for review purposes and I must say that it made my hair feel pretty amazing. I also loved the tingly feeling on my scalp. It did leave the hair a bit dry, but that wouldn't be an issue for most Men (it isn't for my Husband).My Husband has not had any dandruff since he switched over to Clear and he has since told me he wants to replace his Head & Shoulders with Clear. He gives this product two thumbs up and highly recommends it.", "\"This Clear \"\"Scalp Therapy\"\" anti-dandruff shampoo works well to control dandruff and has a pleasant, but not overpowering mint scent. We go through a lot of shampoo in our house since my teens both have very long hair and seem to spend more time in the shower than I remember doing at their age. That being said, we typically use \"\"Head and Shoulders\"\" (or a generic store knock-off) since that worked for us.This Clear shampoo is every bit as effective as what we had been using, leaving the hair and scalp feeling very clean while eliminating dandruff.Highly Recommended!CFH\"", "While I tend to have more of a dry scalp than actual dandruff, I find using a dandruff shampoo is effective for both issues. This shampoo does the job in terms of eliminating flaking, but it comes at a cost -- an unpleasant scent. While dandruff shampoo by nature has a bit of a medicinal scent, the attempt at using mint to mask it does more harm than good, and actually accentuates the medicinal qualities.With the exception of the scent it does everything else very well. Nice consistency (very creamy) and good lather. But that scent is a major drawback for me.Five stars for effectiveness, but only two stars for scent. A three start overall rating.", "\"I have been using Head and Shoulders \"\"forever\"\".  I have moderate dandruff and no matter what, even with Head and Shoulders I still occasionally get flakes now and then.  When I saw Clear was available, I decided to give it a try.  It has the same active ingredient and strength of Pyrithinone Zinc (1.0%) that Head and Shoulders contains.  I enjoy this product, and like the added ingredients it has and does give me a nice cool minty feeling after I shower.  It smells nice, and the feel of the shampoo is nice on my head as well. I will continue to use this product in the future.  Since it has the same ingredients as H&S, I guess it just depends on what I find on sale when I am looking for shampoos.\"", "Okay I know that this is supposedly made for a man, but I said what the heck. Dandruff is dandruff, it knows not sex and neither will this product! The only thing that *might* be considered masculine in this shampoo was the scent. I have been using the leading national brand to keep dandruff away and it has been doing a fine job. But I wanted to try this product since it had some natural ingredients and I was intrigued by the use of mint in it. I'm happy to report that the dandruff is staying away, I love the tingle I get from the mint.My AND my husband (we are both using this product)dandruff has stayed away and we both love the mild mint smell and the fact that our hair is nice and manageable.", "\"So my boyfriend and I both tried this shampoo (with a CLEAR conditioner). Here is the report:Me: I thought the aesthetics of the overtly masculine container were terribly amusing. The slate grey bottle coupled with a \"\"basketball orange\"\" cap shouts, \"\"This is the right shampoo for all your locker-room needs.\"\" Moreover, the viscosity of the shampoo is pleasantly thin. And, as a person who loves rich lather, I was not disappointed in that category. Super rich lather! Likewise, it made my hair feel intensely clean. Now, the scent is slightly off-putting. It is subtly minty, but with an obvious medicinal note. If this shampoo were simply minty, it would be delightful. However, that strange note made this shampoo feel less luxurious and more utilitarian. (And, of course, this may be an aspect of its \"\"masculine charm.\"\")My boyfriend: \"\"My hair is clean.\"\" (The end).If you are not particular about fragrance, you or your boyfriend might find this shampoo refreshing. Nonetheless, if you are sensitive to fragrance, you may wish to give it a smell at your local grocery store before purchasing it.UPDATE: Having used this shampoo for about two weeks now, I REALLY like it! My hair is super clean, light (no build-up at all), and shiny. The scent is still problematic but I cannot deny that this is a fine shampoo. (Extra star added on 8-29-2012!)\"", "This shampoo smells great and my scalp feels amazing. My hair feels clean but not overly dry. Also it smells awesome.", "\"Let me say straight out, I do not suffer from dandruff. As luck would have it, I was asked to test another anti-dandruff shampoo from a different manufacturer (to get the average user's opinion), so I thought I would compare the two. I can say with confidence that Clear Scalp definitely left my hair in better condition than the competitor's. While I would hardly call the result \"\"volumizing\"\" or \"\"strengthening\"\" or anything like that, Clear Scalp did get my hair clean and it felt very natural after shampooing. I like the hint of mint that adds just the slightest tingle on the scalp. I used this for several days in a row, and did not have any noticeable ill effects. This is a reliable, safe, effective shampoo with a nice touch of mint and better conditioning traits than the average anti-dandruff shampoo. Assuming that it does control dandruff, this is a solid four-star product.\"", "With its subtle and masculine cool mint scent CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY is the perfect choice for the male that wants to keep dandruff effectively at bay with a quality shampoo.  This product is designed to be used daily so it is gentle enough to use with each shower.  The ginseng, tea tree and natural mint really do give the user a cooling sensation when the product is applied.  One caveat this is just a shampoo so if the user wants more of a conditioning action  2 in 1 products which are also marketed under the clear men scalp therapy name may be what the buyer needs.", "I got this for my husband and he doesn't have any dandruff but I was hoping to be preventive for any to come! And it seems to be just fine. He is not using it for every wash and he seems to like it just fine. It smells decent and does the job .... nothing much to report here, thank you!", "To be clear, this shampoo is creamy white....not clear.  No big deal.  It helps my dandruff, makes your head tingle, so you feel it working, and leaves it very manageable.  I would recommend it.", "I have had a chronic case of the itch and flake for decades...I've used Selsum, head and shoulders, desenix, etc... This stuff is the best, and it doesn't leave my hair stiff.  As of now, my dandruff is under control... and ... no itch.  I have switched from my old shampoo to this one.", "\"For years I've used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effective than the famous brand. I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with \"\"the other brand\"\", and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand. I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it. The cool sport mint scent is very tame and not overpowering. I think I'm going to permanently switch to this shampoo.\"", "\"I for years used the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo then moved to head and shoulders and switched back and fourth and I must say that this Clear shampoo with Cool Sport Mint works a lot like the tea tree at a fraction of the price. It even has the slight \"\"tingle\"\" sensation from the tea tree chemicals (or whatever it is).The shampoo works well, leaves my hair clean and no issues. Out of the other CLEAR shampoos I've tried this is probably the best one I have used.\"", "\"I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles ofHead & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce,Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml), andHead & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)watched in fear.All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised \"\"bio nutrium 10\"\", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S;), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  As soon as this touches your hair, you know why they call it \"\"cool sport mint\"\".  Your scalp will start to feel cool (or burn) depending on how you describe the sensation.  I had recently taken to using the H&S; Itchy Scalp Eucalyptus for this sensation, and found that the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Cool Sport Mint provides an even strong and better anti-itch cooling feel.The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  The cooling sensation lasted for about 30 minutes after the shower, and unlike the \"\"Strong\"\" variety, I didn't smell tea-tree oil.  I was quite pleased.For itchy scalps, this is the best of the Clear Men's line.  Like the \"\"Strong\"\", I needed to use conditioner afterwards as it seemed to strip my hair of volume and shape.  It doesn't claim to be \"\"2 in 1\"\", but even as regular shampoo, I was surprised.Pair it with a good conditioner and you'll have a great replacement for H&S; with a wonderful cooling sensation.  Recommended!\"", "This worked for me, left my hair feeling nice and other features of the product seemed to work fine for me. About all these ingredients - Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives, including ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins B5 & E, sunflower, soybean, almond & coconut oils to nourish deeply, I really don't know, though I didn't notice the mint as the ad said I would, but that was OK.", "This Clear scalp therapy shampoo/condtioner has pyrithione zinc for dandruff control, ginseng, natural mint, tea tree, among other things. It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling. In the end I have had no complaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again.", "\"I have used this product for about a week now, and found that it does a \"\"just right\"\" job in my case.The product has a nice, simple \"\"clean\"\" smell that does leave behind a strong perfume-like odor. (It seems to me that a lot of men's  shampoos these days would be better suited for women, based upon the residual smell. I want to smell clean, but not like I've been doused in perfume. :-) )It also seems to control the few flakes that I get from time to time.In short, this product was a good fit for me; neither too much nor too little in any one area, with no residual build up or over-cleaning my hair.\"", "This product provides a more pleasing scent and feel than the leading brand dandruff shampoo, which has a thick, gooey quality that disagrees with me.  And the gentler consistency does not seem to compromise the effectiveness of the product's dandruff-controlling ingredients.  I anticipate switching to this product line for my future purchases of anti-dandruff shampoo.", "I'm not one to use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo but my husband does. He's been using this for awhile and has been very pleased with the results.Washes well, rinses clean and doesn't have that strong chemical smell that some of the other anti-dandruff shampoos have (and you know who you are...).I like the style of bottle and the fact that it can stand upright, always keeping the opening of the bottle packed with shampoo to the last use. Easy snap open top that seals tight without leaking.A recommended, affordable, anti-dandruff shampoo.", "Although I am not a man, I gave this shampoo a try. It smelled nice, worked on the very few flakes I had, but stung like boy howdy! Even after a long, long rinse, I felt as if my head was on fire. The burning lasted for hours, so I didn't give the shampoo another try.On the other hand, the bottle had the most intelligent, easiest to use cap that I have ever seen on a bottle of shampoo, bar none. A press on the side of the cap is all that is necessary to open the bottle, and it's easy to use even with my eyes shut and with soapy hands.If only the shampoo didn't cause me extreme pain. Too bad. (Maybe it's because I am woman, and it doesn't like me. :-)  )", "Another great Clear brand shampoo.  I have tried a number of their products in the last few months and have found all of Clear's dandruff shampoo products to be a cut above and every bit as effective as H&S; but with the added value of not needing to use as much since it is concentrated.  Even the bottle is easy to grip and the shampoo comes out very easily.I wanted to try the Cool Sport Mint variety and it feels both great to use and leaves a nice subtle scent.  As with all my other Clear shampoo products this will leave your hair thoroughly cleaned but not oily feeling. Plenty of lather and an easy rinse off are what I have found to be the case with all the Clear shampoos I have tried so far.Basically all the varieties of Clear I have used employ a varying special formulation that includes tea tree among other ingredients. Some with conditioner, some without.  Now I am no expert but honestly my hair is much more manageable after a weeks use of Clear brand shampoo as opposed to H&S; and the anti dandruff ingredients do the trick 100%!Even if you are set in your ways as far as your shampoo goes, give this one a try because there is a very good chance you will come to the same conclusion as I have, Clear brand products really ROCK in the shower and give you everything you want from a shampoo. This one is especially full of ZIP and gives me a really clean feeling head of hair! An honest recommendation!", "I ordered this for my son who has struggled with dandruff since he entered his teens. Other shampoos have helped some but none as much as this one. Not only does the shampoo smell and clean well it also helps fight his dandruff problem, making him a more confident young man. I love this shampoo and will continue to purchase it for him.", "Just tried this shampoo and it seems to be a good product.  The shampoo smells like mint and lathers easily.
