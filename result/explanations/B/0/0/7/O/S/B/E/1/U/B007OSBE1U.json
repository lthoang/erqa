Unfortunately, I found the Donut Shop Blend a little harsh for my taste (admittedly, I'm the kind of person who drinks my sugar and cream with a little bit of coffee), but my husband enjoyed them quite a lot.", "\"The best word I can use to describe this coffee is nondescript.  There isn't a \"\"fresh\"\" coffee smell when it brews like other brands, and it really doesn't have a lot of flavor.  I am a cream no sugar kinda gal, and it seemed rather weak to me when I added cream to it.I have a keurig that has three settings, and I tried it on the 8oz setting like the package suggested.  Rather weak but drinkable.  I tried it on the 6 oz setting, and it still seemed weak and quite bitter.  It was coffee, and it did the job of waking me up, but it wasn't an \"\"enjoyable\"\" experience that I have gotten from other donut shop blend brands.  I would drink this again, but only if there wasn't any other options for me.\"", "I was excited to get Martinson Coffee Capsules, Donut Shop Blend for I am always on the lookout to try new K cups in my Keurig. But I have to say that the taste of these are kinda mellow and don't really carry a huge flavor with them. They are a light to medium roast but to me they tasted more light than anything. I like to dress my coffee up with yummy creamers... and even after adding some dark chocolate with raspberry creamer the taste was still mellow. In fact it even had a slight after taste to it that was bitter. Thinking that it might be the creamer mix with the coffee I tried just a straight vanilla creamer but behold the bitter after taste was still there. Also it is just to mellow for me to really enjoy. In the mornings I am looking for a medium to bold roast that will get me up and moving in my day. I felt like I needed double the coffee on the days I made these. Even though the price is good for the amount you get... needing double to get up in the morning just doesn't make it worth it for me. I would rather go out and buy a really bold blend that doesn't have a bitter taste to it.", "Martinson's Donut Shop Blend k cups were a wonderful new addition to our coffee choices.It is a light but satisfying blend with just enough caffeine to start the day.None in my household care for very dark heavy roasts with a high caffeine jolt.It fact, most enjoy caramel, hazelnut and butter toffee flavoring.I have come to prefer a pure coffee flavor, and others in my home tried the Donut Shop Blend and were pleasantly surprised and are drinking and enjoying this choice as well.Martinson's Hazelnut is a lighter coffee blend, but not too light.  Aromas of true hazelnut accompany a genuine hazelnut taste...another fine coffee!", "This is pretty good tasting coffee as far as k-cup coffee goes. It doesn't have the burned taste that we've noticed with some k-cups.The packaging is attractive. The price seems reasonable at this time; it's what I would expect and comparable to other brands.I'd be interested to try non k-cup Martinson coffee now. I had never heard of them but the k-cups exceeded my expectations.", "I really loved the strong, but very smooth flavor of this blend.  I generally drink most coffees with sweetener and flavored cream.  However, the smooth taste of this tea turned me into a lover of black, or black with a light sweetener. This coffee has a rich, robust flavor with no after taste.  This is my new favorite and I'll definitely go to this one again and again!", "I have a serious love affair with my Keurig but the downside to it is the cost of Kcups. I've tried using various fill-your-own Kcup products, but none produce the quality of coffee I get from using the pre-filled Kcups. Because they are pricey, I'm always interested in lower-cost alternatives.This was a nice blend, but I didn't think it compared to some of the higher-quality--and pricier--blends I've used from companies like Green Mountain. This is probably also partially due to this being a lighter blend of coffee than I normally prefer. It's good, but it lacks the rich, full-bodied characteristics of a really good bean. I didn't get the same chocolate or caramel notes that I taste when I'm drinking some of the higher-end Kcups. Still, that doesn't mean this is bad coffee. It's a good, solid, middle-of-the-road kind of coffee. If that's what you're looking for, you really can't argue with the price of these Kcups. However, if you want something with more vibrant flavor, you may want to try a different brand.", "I have a Keurig at work, and use it daily. I tend to use a refillable K-cup with my own home-ground coffee to save money / reduce waste, but I got these K-cups as a sample and have been using them for a couple weeks. In short -- I think these are the best combination of quality / affordability of any K-cups I've seen. Definitely the best value.FLAVOR / AROMA:- rich, but definitely not as rich as some other brands. My cubemate uses Starbucks K-cups and I swear his are way more aromatic while brewing (and probably more flavorful). I also have some Van Houtte K-cups as well, and they seem a bit bolder.QUALITY / BUILD:- pretty much your standard K-cupVALUE:- these are cheap, and ship free. Definitely the best overall value I've seen in K-cups on Amazon. Maybe you can find cheaper ones at TJ Maxx or something, but these are a good deal.BOTTOM LINE:- if you're a Keurig user, give this brand a try.", "I'm a huge fan of donut shop coffee flavors, even though most of them still have a rather unique taste depending on how the company thinks the coffee should taste. I will openly say that I prefer the Diedrich Coffee version of donut shop, although I would buy this in the future with my own money.The big issue I had was that this wasn't as strong as I was hoping it'd be, and I mean that in a way that doesn't really have anything to do with roast levels. It's a light roast, but it tastes a little lighter than some of the other coffees I've had that were light roasts. I'm going to experiment with water levels to see what would make it strong enough to suit me, so this isn't an insurmountable problem unless you have one of the Keurigs that keeps water in it for multiple cups.This is still tasty, so even though it doesn't have as prominent of a flavor as I'd like, it's still a nice cup. If you're not a fan of milder tasting coffee, I'd skip to the next step up and get the medium roast. I think that's what I might do with my next foray into this brand of coffee. Although if you like a mild cup that isn't an overwhelmingly strong flavor, this is definitely for you. It's not flavorless, just mild.", "For me, Martinson Dark Roast K-cup Coffee is perfect for morning coffee. It's a great perk me up cup and the flavor is just the way I like it, strong but not bitter. These K-cups arrived with next day shipping with Prime which is great because I was just about out of coffee and the timing couldn't have been better!I enjoy the Martinson brand for its great quality and I will continue to try their coffees and pick out favorites. Their K-cups are well constructed and the coffee so far for me, has always been described accurately for their customers. This is a nice, strong Dark Roast comparable to French roast coffee which is exactly what I like in the morning. It is too strong if you need something lighter in the afternoon, but perfect for morning time!It's been a while since I first tried this coffee and I have reordered it many times since. For the cost, this is a very high quality coffee and I love the taste of all of the bold coffees Martinson offers.", "This is OK coffee. It tastes comparable to Folgers, though maybe a bit less bitter, or some of the other less expensive popular brands.There is no extra coffee in these k-cups. The directions say use 8 ounces. The coffee is very weak if you try to use more water than that. A regular size cup will require 2 capsules.", "I am a true Java Junkie and drink my Coffee all day long. I have loved coffee ever since I was a kid and have probably tried hundreds of different types of coffee by now. I have used K-Cups for several years now and love the convenience of them but don't usually care for the price. Depending on the type of K-Cups you can pay up to a dollar per K-Cup for some of them. At the current price these are a little more reasonably priced than some of the others. I still wouldn't consider them cheap but I would buy them at this price.I had never tried or heard of Martinson coffee before but I am always excited to try something new. This coffee has a nice, strong flavor that suits my taste. It's not my absolute favorite coffee but it in my top ten coffees. It's a type of coffee that I could easily drink every day. These are real coffee and not cheap instant coffee like some K-Cups use. I look forward to trying some of their other blends as well like the French Roast, Dark Roast or House Blend. They also have breakfast blend, hazlenut and a variety pack.", "This coffee has a slightly different taste to it,depending on which size cup you brew it on. I generally use a larger cup but decided to brew an eight-ounce cup; much better results.", "What shall I say? This coffee tasted like coffee. Is that good or bad? Well, if you want coffee-tasting-coffee, you have a good light brew here. If you want your coffee to resound with the floral undertones of the cherry blossom and then follow with a brisk chocolate-vanilla finish, well, not here.This is a wake-up in the morning and have a cup-of-coffee before you can function coffee. It's good for that. On 8 oz brew, the flavor strength is good, not too bitter, and the profile is right-down-the-middle. It works for dumping in a little cream, a little sugar, and having that taste mix.There are some grounds that come through---you can see the company's response to a few other reviews for why that happens. Being one who brews coffee in a french press at times, I use a coarser grind to keep that very thing from happening. However, the residue from a couple of k-cups is not a major issue. Now, if I were to keep the same mug running all day and get the same amount of grounds per cup? That bottom layer would get nasty.As it stands, the last sip is still drinkable.So, check your prices---the Keurig patent has expired, so there are a good number of new k-cup sources coming online. This one is not the Cadillac of quality, but the box of 48 I had were dependable, consistent, drinkable coffee.", "\"The positives about Martinson's Donut Shop Blend Coffee Capsules are that they taste fresh, the flavor is distinctive, and it's strong. For me the negative was that I wasn't stupendously crazy about the actual taste of the coffee. If you've ever tried Ethiopian beans, that would be how I would describe this coffee. Bold? Yes. Earthy? Yes. Acid undertone? Definite yes. Ethiopian beans are not for everyone, they have a strong spicy taste, as opposed to a smooth flavor like a Kona blend. I'd even go so far as to say it's a bit on the bitter side. That is the best way I can describe the taste of this coffee, which to me, is not indicative of a \"\"donut shop blend\"\" experience. To me, the donut shop labeling means more of a lighter roast and smoother taste than what these k-cups were or that's my perception of the donut shop flavor name anyway...If you enjoy a hearty cup of coffee and like having lot of flavor in every mouthful I don't think you'll be disappointed with these k-cups. It might not be the right flavor for you if you usually go the smoother, middle of the road coffee experience for your daily cup. It is billed as a \"\"light\"\" coffee, I would not say that is true, in my opinion. This is a hearty coffee in taste, and in color; it takes a lot of creamer to lighten it. Which is fine, but that is what you usually see in the k-cups labeled \"\"bold\"\", not \"\"light\"\".Another positive is that the cost of these k-cups is usually fairly low at around .52/cup. Nice.\"", "Coffee is such a personal thing! This coffee, brewed in a Keurig at the 8 ounce setting did not make a coffee I liked--it wasn't particularly strong and rich and had a slightly bitter, even acidic undertone to me. I generally drink coffee made in a french press, but have had some delicious cups in a Keurig such asStarbucks Caffe Verona, Dark, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers 54-Count. I will not buy more when this is gone.", "Have tried other brands of donut shop blend K-Cups.  I think this one is about as good as it gets!  Not as strong as you would expect from other blends, that's to be expected.  I realize that the taste of just about anything is subjective.  We are all different, as are our tastes.  Newman's is a favorite as are some of the San Francisco Bay blends.  I think for a blend that is just a bit less strong this fits the bill very well.  We should probably take reviews on coffee not too seriously as I previously noted that my taste will certainly be different than that of others, including my sweet wife!This appears to be a premium brand.  We have tried other Martinson blends and they all seem to be a quality product.", "We like a medium roast coffee and this coffee has a great full flavor.  As compared to other brands the Martinson does a great job and works well in our Kurig coffee maker.  Yes I would recommend", "Let me start out by saying that we are used to the medium roast.  Having the opportunity to try a different variety, I decided to try this Donut Shop Blend.  After brewing the first cup at my normal 9-10oz using a Keurig Personal Mini Brewer, this blend was considerably weak.  I decided to try a smaller cup, using 6-7oz of water which made a huge difference, giving it a stronger taste.  When I need that large cup of coffee, I'll brew 2 6oz cups using 2 k-cups but will opt for the medium roast next time around.  Overall I'm happy with the Martinson taste.", "Martinson Donut Shop Blend is a tasty cup of coffee.  It's not too strong nor is it weak.  The cost of this K-up is reasonable compared to others.  My wife and I both brought them to your jobs and were happy with it.  My wife is a big fan of DD coffee, so to have her like this one is a big plus.", "\"Martinson's Donut Shop Blend can be best characterized as an \"\"American Style\"\" light roast coffee. The name implies that it is similar to coffee such as Dunkin Donuts, but the Martinson Coffee is higher quality. Still, it is reminiscent of other mainstream brands such as 8 O'Clock. It is a bright, slightly acidic coffee that is counter to the dark roasts I usually like. At the medium setting on the Keurig (8 oz setting) it produces a very flavorful cup, but at the larger setting it might be disappointing for those looking for something with more impact. The sealed cups look like K-Cups but are an unlicensed variant called a \"\"RealCup\"\", but for all practical purposes they work exactly the same way. I had no problems with them in my Keurig - they work and look fine. All in all, this is a coffee that offers a nice change of pace - a decent cup of coffee that is definitely a cut above Folger's and other common American brands of coffee.\"", "Martinson Coffees are full-bodied.  If you like Hazelnut Coffee, its one of the best and there was an extra amount of Hazelnut in the Variety Pack that I received - not sure if that is the norm.", "Martinson Coffee Donut Shop Blend has a pleasing light taste and is low in acid after taste.  While I generally prefer darker roasts for my coffee (French or Italian), sometimes I want a kick of caffeine in the morning and this brand does the trick.  The lighter the roast, the stronger the caffeine is the the general rule.  I would not use this coffee for a late in the day beverage - unless I planned on staying up really late that night.I recommend it for anyone who likes a lighter tasting coffee.", "Martinson Coffee Capsules, Donut Shop BlendI love this coffee. It's not strong, but not weak either. The setting on my Keurig stays on 8 ounces because anything else is too weak for me and this setting and coffee is just about perfect for my taste. If you like strong coffee, then this one is not for you.I think it's a good deal, too - it's less expensive than the K-cups I've been ordering.", "Martinson Coffee Capsules, Donut Shop Blend Package compatible with Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 48 CountSigh, I wanted to like this as I am a fan of Coffee People's version and liked Martinson's House Blend. Unfortunately it's not meant to be. It is too weak for me. Even when brewed on the recommended 8oz setting it just has no oomph to me. I can even brew Coffee Peoples version on the 10oz setting and be happy. The word that comes to my mind is, thin, it just isn't making me wake up in the morning like a good coffee should. I tried about a dozen pods before writing this just to be sure. I won't be buying this flavor any more.", "I'm a big fan of the Martinson coffee blends, and Donut Shop Blend lives up the expectation. It's a more mellow, mild coffee, great for an afternoon pick-me-up.", "This is a light roast coffee. I did not care for it at all. It has a watered down taste. The coffee had an odd sweetness to it. I tried making it with less water but it did not seem to help. I do tend to like darker roasts better but still felt that this was lacking.I do want to mention that I had my mother try it and she said she did like it but did not feel it was good enough to buy on a regular basis which is why I gave it 3 stars to be fair.", "This coffee is ADDICTING and yes what an amazing price. I really never drank coffee till just this year, no one else in my family drinks it so i never did.Then I decided to give a Keurig a try and this one so far is my favorite. It is a a light brew and not that strong but it taste great will be ordering more.", "\"This has become my new favorite coffee.  I love the flavor, not too strong, no \"\"bite\"\" to it that many coffees have.  I have to confess- I'm cheap.  I buy the strong K-cups so I can make the travel mug size with one K-cup.  The problem with that is that many of them have a \"\"bite\"\" or bitterness to them.  This coffee was strong enough to make a great cup of coffee in the travel mug size and still be a mellow flavor.  I am very picky about my coffee as well, so for me to switch coffee is a big deal, and I have switched coffee after getting this coffee to try through the Vine Program.I would highly recommend this coffee.\"", "I bought these because the price was excellent and my husb sometimes drinks 5 cups per day. He has a home office and a stressful job!My husb never complains about the coffee but with this one he asked me what it was and that he didn't really like it much and to not order it again...!Also, I found myself reaching for Tully's or Deidrichs and not using this one. It is OK but the flavor is not quality to where you feel special while drinking it...ya know? Hard to explain but it's just plain ole coffee.However, I decided to go for the blue label Martinson, Brazilian, and that one is much better.I do have to say that we both really like the new Brooklyn Beans...price is EXCELLENT and the Fuggetaboudit is great!  but they just can't seem to keep it in stock. Unfortunately, I see a price increase as their heads enlarge.", "I'm very pleased with this K Cup from Martinson coffee.  I like a strong coffee full of flavor without bitterness, and this one hits that mark for me.  It has a rich flavor that wakes me up in the morning, and I'll add this one to my rotation.  My husband didn't care much for this one, however he tends to favor french roast coffee.", "\"If you're reading this I don't have to tell you that the Keurig type brewers have exploded in kitchens and supermarkets everywhere and this review will not be to discuss the debates I hear about \"\"are they worth it\"\" and complaints about the expense of the K-Cups. (Although THIS coffee comes at a pleasing 52 cents a cup compared to a buck or more for many of the K-Cups.)Finally - to the Martinson Donut Shop blend.  It's a nice smooth, but not particularly bold or strong-flavored coffee.  The Mrs. and I are both \"\"every day\"\" coffee drinkers and we both agreed that this was a pleasant tasting coffee.  She pointed out that not everyone LIKES a STRONG coffee - this is a superb choice for THAT coffee drinker!We could debate flavors and brands endlessly - but if you're looking for a pleasant, inexpensive, not particularly strong K-Cup of coffee: you could hardly do better than Martinson Donut Shop Blend.\""], "Gamma": [0.15111859142780304, 0.14461040496826172, 0.1574106216430664, 0.1844053566455841, 0.15899023413658142, 0.2034648060798645], "Beta": [[0.03155248612165451, 0.03360160440206528, 0.02912398800253868, 0.03540541231632233, 0.03327383100986481, 0.03308257460594177, 0.031622905284166336, 0.0326562337577343, 0.027060233056545258, 0.028965674340724945, 0.031941626220941544, 0.03215610235929489, 0.035529013723134995, 0.02816805988550186, 0.029653599485754967, 0.0295623317360878, 0.027040544897317886, 0.034497201442718506, 0.03329075127840042, 0.03168917074799538, 0.02700887992978096, 0.02279035747051239, 0.03163697570562363, 0.03158276528120041, 0.030608974397182465, 0.033553704619407654, 0.0328177735209465, 0.03334116190671921, 0.02872491627931595, 0.03590932488441467, 0.03262573480606079, 0.029526080936193466], [0.0310450941324234, 0.03287254273891449, 0.02918420173227787, 0.034301869571208954, 0.032205160707235336, 0.032283347100019455, 0.03137125074863434, 0.03178233280777931, 0.029154619202017784, 0.028810760006308556, 0.031103011220693588, 0.03111039288341999, 0.03399347886443138, 0.035293348133563995, 0.03029913641512394, 0.028717221692204475, 0.0332631841301918, 0.03327803313732147, 0.03235196694731712, 0.03065771982073784, 0.028236428275704384, 0.026303453370928764, 0.030710818246006966, 0.0311695858836174, 0.028363540768623352, 0.03218575567007065, 0.03214247524738312, 0.03223318234086037, 0.03007207252085209, 0.035241544246673584, 0.03195926919579506, 0.028303151950240135], [0.03159598633646965, 0.03544652834534645, 0.02769731730222702, 0.03897400200366974, 0.03400903195142746, 0.034400228410959244, 0.03220290318131447, 0.03325438126921654, 0.026740621775388718, 0.027359163388609886, 0.03155628964304924, 0.031706154346466064, 0.038230545818805695, 0.022664660587906837, 0.030356746166944504, 0.026872623711824417, 0.01966216042637825, 0.03607716038823128, 0.03447287157177925, 0.03612673282623291, 0.02606673538684845, 0.01705724559724331, 0.03154675289988518, 0.0313432514667511, 0.029401838779449463, 0.03428585082292557, 0.03385157510638237, 0.03468798100948334, 0.03191398084163666, 0.03982354328036308, 0.03371506556868553, 0.026900069788098335], [0.031116561964154243, 0.0338628776371479, 0.028034668415784836, 0.03698134422302246, 0.033311888575553894, 0.033310361206531525, 0.031299084424972534, 0.03224863111972809, 0.025964798405766487, 0.02667839080095291, 0.03128725662827492, 0.03142644092440605, 0.03671517223119736, 0.0310561191290617, 0.029384298250079155, 0.025992467999458313, 0.029639143496751785, 0.035248178988695145, 0.03340001031756401, 0.03586355224251747, 0.029129881411790848, 0.023547617718577385, 0.03038245439529419, 0.031486254185438156, 0.028168724849820137, 0.03324897214770317, 0.032732635736465454, 0.033037032932043076, 0.02865695022046566, 0.03854924067854881, 0.03246946632862091, 0.02576952986419201], [0.03130267187952995, 0.033448003232479095, 0.028567273169755936, 0.03594987094402313, 0.0334329791367054, 0.033116474747657776, 0.031244659796357155, 0.032381437718868256, 0.025612574070692062, 0.02766888029873371, 0.03181016072630882, 0.03208743780851364, 0.036193013191223145, 0.03113899566233158, 0.028885941952466965, 0.027908792719244957, 0.03046691231429577, 0.03505678474903107, 0.033288516104221344, 0.03282063454389572, 0.02779068611562252, 0.024098776280879974, 0.030953748151659966, 0.03165304288268089, 0.02936970442533493, 0.03357786312699318, 0.03267009183764458, 0.033083174377679825, 0.02727982960641384, 0.037041716277599335, 0.03239176422357559, 0.027707604691386223], [0.031204892322421074, 0.03419800102710724, 0.027651038020849228, 0.03813956677913666, 0.03375431150197983, 0.03375621885061264, 0.03122260607779026, 0.03249805048108101, 0.024898303672671318, 0.02586411125957966, 0.03136560320854187, 0.03155859187245369, 0.03791152685880661, 0.029022643342614174, 0.02923971228301525, 0.024949554353952408, 0.027630923315882683, 0.03602702543139458, 0.03387770429253578, 0.038154177367687225, 0.029635939747095108, 0.022037796676158905, 0.030238691717386246, 0.03158748149871826, 0.027978306636214256, 0.033693451434373856, 0.03291963040828705, 0.033362992107868195, 0.028267070651054382, 0.039884697645902634, 0.03263595700263977, 0.02483346313238144]]}
