"], "reviews": ["This is my first experience of Ethiopian coffee, and it has more complexity of flavor, more richness and depth, than the South American coffees I typically drink. It has a low acidity which means there isn't a great deal of bitterness--a dash of almond milk further mellows the coffee and brings out the flavor. I don't know if the coffee is ground finer than other K-cup varieties, but I've noticed coffee sludge in the bottom of my cup, which isn't typical from my experience with Keurig machines. Not a big deal at all, however.In conclusion, this is a coffee I will definitely enjoy and would seriously consider buying when this box is empty.", "Not overly strong, but smooth and delicious.  I didn't notice the 'floral aroma and delicate citrus and green tea notes' that was supposed to be the Ethiopian flavor of this coffee, be it did remind me of Gevalia which has been my favorite for years.  If you're a big Starbucks fan, this may not be strong enough for you, but 1 cup made one large mug for me and it was perfect.  Plus the price is hard to beat (it averages about $0.50 per K-cup).Works perfectly with my Keurig, and the cups themselves are actually really elegant looking, so if you have an on the counter caddy, no worries about these being a visual distraction.  The seal does seem to be thicker than the Keurig brand cups, since you do have to press down a little harder to puncture it, but that's not a big deal.  I'll be trying other flavors when these run out.", "I found this coffee to be very different and a pleasant change from what I usually drink. When it brews there is a somewhat pungent aroma and you know this coffee is going to be different. The first sip can be more bitter than most coffees but this sensation rapidly disappears as you drink some more. This coffee does have a citrus acidity to it and I find it somewhat hard to describe. The more I drink it the more I like it and look forward to enjoying this special coffee from one of the best growing regions in the world.", "i've had my Keurig for about 2 years now & have sampled around 30 varieties of coffees.  this is one of the best.  at the 10 oz. setting, this coffee is strong enough to make a good cup of coffee (i'd set it at 8 or 6 oz) if i wanted a richer brew, but the 10 oz.  gives me a bigger cup.  some of the Keurig coffees have a strong bitter taste but this one does not.  only slightly bitter but i think all coffees are slightly bitter.  i always add cream to my coffee, not a black drinker.the coffee does have a nice, unique tone, probably it's Ethiopian flavor, which i find nice & not weird like some other beans.this is a good coffee & i highly recommend it.", "I was prepared, based on the negative reviews if this coffee, to not like it.  But happily I've thoroughly enjoyed two mugs ths morning.  I use Silk original creamer in my coffee so I can't say how the coffee tastes black.  But it's very good with a little creamer.  My favorite is Columbian and this coffee is similar, it's a bold taste.  I use the middle button for serving size on the Keurig.", "\"Not one of us who tried this coffee have ever been to Ethiopia nor have we been to a \"\"genuine Ethiopian coffee shop.\"\" Therefore we have no way of comparing this coffee to \"\"real Ethiopian coffee\"\" but only to what we normally drink, which, in our Keurig, is normally either Green Mountain Colombian or Newman's Extra Bold.My review:Rating: three starsFor my first cup of Black Gold Ethiopian coffee I used 2 K cups at 6 ounces each. The resulting cup didn't have any of the real aroma that you often get from a freshly brewed cup of coffee. I drink my coffee with cream and sugar so I added 1 teaspoon of sugar and my usual dollop of half-and-half. At this point the coffee didn't look \"\"light enough\"\" so I added a bit more cream. The flavor wasn't that bad, but there really was nothing to distinguish this from other \"\"run-of-the-mill\"\" coffees. I thought it had a slightly \"\"harsher\"\" flavor similar to that of Medaglia D'oro. I also thought it tasted a bit \"\"thin.\"\"One eight-ounce cup tasted a bit weak to me.Mrs. Boilermate's review:Rating: three starsTried 6 oz. cup black. OK taste, nothing outstanding. Taste did not seem to be that bold or intense. No noticeable \"\"coffee aroma.\"\"Tried 10 oz. cup (since marked as \"\"bold\"\") black. This was a little weak, and probably would not work with cream and sugar. Over all, an acceptable cup of coffee. I would be more likely to drink it at work. On a weekend morning or when relaxing over a cup of coffee, I would most likely drink something else.Friend number one's review:Rating: four stars8 ounce cup with sugar. He said he liked the flavor, and it compared favorably to the \"\"fancy coffees you find at the Hess Mart.\"\"Friend number two's review:Rating: four stars6 ounce cup black. Friend number two said he liked the coffee but offered no further comment.Bottom line:Average rating: 3.5 stars. Our friends seemed to like it better than we did.For us, our Keurig is a bit of a \"\"guilty pleasure\"\" and we enjoy the variety afforded us because of it. It is nice to be able to try different blends such as this one provided by Vine. But there really wasn't enough to like in this blend to purchase it, despite its lower price compared to Green Mountain coffee. As they say, \"\"You get what you pay for.\"\"We will use up the supply simply because we don't want to waste it, but there are too many other better tasting K cups out there.\"", "\"I enjoy the ease of tossing the 'Real Cup' in my Keurig coffee maker. I have one of the 'office' models, so not all of the reusable products work in my coffee maker. These \"\"coffee capsules' were compatible with my Keurig K-Cup brewer. They are the size of K-Cups.The coffee is strong, what I would call \"\"smoky\"\", and I noticed what was almost that bitter green-tea accent at times.For the most part, it's just a very robust, dark coffee, which may be stronger than my preference for breakfast, but just right later in the day when I want strong coffee. I like it.\"", "I drink a lot of coffee and was eager to try this Brown Gold capsule (since it can't be called a k-cup!). This product was really enjoyed by myself as well as my office. It's a very bold flavor which I love- I have theKeurig B70 Platinum Brewing Systemand this capsule makes excellent coffee in the largest cup setting.I really dislike bold coffees that leave a bitter aftertaste, you won't get that issue with this one at all. The ladies at my job all enjoyed it too and they gave the same feedback that I'm giving. The clincher is the great price- very much recommended !", "I spend most of my workday in a closed computer lab -- whirring servers, mice and keyboard clicking, and a super-industrial strength A/C that keeps it freezing cold. To combat the tedium and cold, I brought in my Keurig. Our team all chip in with K-cups.These Ethiopian capsules have a nice, bold flavor... definitely not for those who favor light / medium roasts, but I find the flavor pleasant with a little cream and some sweetener (I use agave nectar at work).While these aren't the gourmet experience that some other brands might provide ('Southern Pecan' flavor or 'Cinnamon Swirl' being some hits around here), they're flavorful, strong, and best of all -- pretty cheap. These are just about the cheapest K-cups you can find and are a good choice for places where quantity is important. A bunch of programmers trapped in a computer lab is perfect for this product, and I give it 5 stars.", "The more I drink of this coffee, the more I like it. Brown Gold Ethiopian blend has a very nice, rich flavor. This is a bold coffee but doesn't taste like it can walk away. It has a mellow flavor that is strong but not too overwhelming. I have recently been drinking Sumatra coffee, and while I do like strong coffee and prefer French roast, the Sumatra is way too strong and is bitter with a bitter after taste. This Ethiopian blend of coffee is somewhere in the middle and has a nice clear flavor perfect for the morning brew.I found this particular K-cup to have the perfect amount of coffee for my morning cup but isn't too strong that it jolts me awake. I would highly recommend you try Brown Gold for the Keurig if you like a bold coffee that doesn't taste too overwhelmingly strong. This one has nice under tones of flavor that make it a sophisticated, good tasting coffee. I also think that for the quality of this coffee, the 48 cup count is a good deal for the price. The packaging for these 'capsules' is also a pretty gold color which I really like.", "I'm a Barista Italian Roast drinker.  Compared to that coffee, this Brown Gold just tastes nasty.  I gave it a star, though, because it a bold nasty which is better than a weak nasty.", "\"My wife and I usually drink whichever variety of bold K-cups that happen to be on sale at the store, but we was pleasantly surprised by this Ethiopian brew. While we did not find them to be exceptionally better than the average k-cup, it is definitely on par with our other favorite varieties.  We both agree with many of the other reviewers here, however, that it is not as \"\"bold\"\" as most other bold coffee varieties, but the good flavor makes up for it.\"", "Brown Gold 100% Ethiopian Blend is a Medium-Dark Roast, and I like it. Using -8-10 ounces of water, the coffee can be a little bold/strong and slightly bitter. My normal coffee preference is a more medium roast though, so it may just be me. I find brewing a 12 pounce mug comes out almost perfect for my tastes. The flavor is a little less bold, but by no means weak. It just makes a nice cup of coffee. Brown Gold 100% Ethiopian Blend isn't my favorite coffee, but I enjoy it. At about 50 cents per K-Cup, it is also reasonable compared to some other brands.Unless your coffee preference is a mild roast, I recommend giving Brown Gold 100% Ethiopian Blend a try. It's good quality coffee, at a good price.", "This is a very strong bold coffee. I liked it because it did not have a bitter taste. It works great in the Keurig. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I had residue in the bottom of my coffee cup, I hate that!", "\"I'm staring at the bottom of my mug after four \"\"Capsules\"\" of Brown Gold. (Of course, read \"\"capsules\"\" as \"\"K-cup compatible plastic things\"\") The first thing I would highlight is this: there is no major sludge accumulation at the bottom. I have used a different variety that uses the same \"\"Real Cup\"\" technology, and it let a lot of grounds through, but after a day of just adding one more cup to this mug, there's no accumulation.Now, that may mean I ate the grounds in a fit of caffeine addiction, but I'm guessing not since the prior brand settled out.Flavor-wise, this is a good strong coffee flavor. I like coffees that are not weak to the taste, and this one hit nicely. I will not tell you it had \"\"delicate undertones\"\" or any such--it was a strong coffee with a solid flavor. I'm starting to find that I prefer African sourced coffees to Latin American for that reason.Back to the cup: the taste is nice and bold. Full flavored, not weak. Even using my Keurig on the 'bigger cup' setting which usually washes out a normal K-cup, the Brown Gold still produced a solid flavor.Price-wise, you're about where the original brand for the machine is, so you're not saving but you're also not overspending, so it's worth a try.\"", "\"I really enjoy these 'Brown Gold' coffee capsules (which are compatible with keurig k-cup brewers). They are designed nearly identical to actual 'k-cups'... the only difference I can see is that the material that covers the top of the capsule is different. It's not foil (or the same type foil) which covers a typical k-cup.These Brown Gold Ethiopian coffee capsules taste really good and smooth. Although they are advertised as \"\"bold\"\", I find that they are not as bold tasting or dark as other bold k-cups. I don't mind though because the flavors are bold enough for my liking and have subtle flavors that are usually lost in 'extra bold' varieties of k-cups. I would describe the flavors of this coffee as more complex as usual bold coffees.  To me, this interesting mix of complexity and bold flavor is a good mix!  It also has a smooth taste that is usually only present in medium roast coffee as well. I think a better description of this coffee is a \"\"strong medium roast with complex and smooth notes\"\"... because \"\"bold\"\" doesn't adequately describe it. Whatever the case may be, I would definitely recommend coffee lovers to try this coffee for themselves. It is surprisingly good and has unique qualities that are best experienced first-hand and not through mere words :)\"", "\"This coffee was a pleasant surprise. It is labeled as \"\"Bold\"\" but is not as bold as other brands that I have brewed since I recently got a Keurig K-Cup brewer. I usually drink two mugs of coffee in the morning. I don't use sugar but I do splash in some non-fat milk. This Ethiopian coffee is very smooth and the boldness is not severe and just perfect for my preference. When I drink coffee in the morning on an empty stomach I get a somewhat unsettling feeling in my stomach. With this Ethiopian my stomach accepted it without complaint. I have not had Ethiapian coffee before and usually would brew Columbian. I am still a fan of Columbian but this Ethiopian is very good and I will be getting more of it when the present supply runs out.\"", "This free sample of Brown Gold coffee, for use in a Keurig type of coffee maker was delicious.  It was a pleasant surprise that made our day!  The package contains  3 single serve cups of ground coffee, made with beans from a 100% single origin (not blended with other beans).  This particular one is pure Peruvian ground coffee, a very tasty medium roast.  Brown Gold coffee is also involved with a coffee producing area in Ethiopia, and is working with the people to create a better and healthy life.  I like that there are companies (coffee or anything else) that have decided to embrace their good values, and concentrate on quality, and have the passion to create a pure product in a positive way.  As this Canadian company says: &#34;No Compromise&#34;!", "Being a coffee enthusiast, I found the Brown Gold 100% Ethiopian coffee to be more mild than bold in taste. The flavor on the other hand was actually quite good. I appreciate the citrus tones and smooth yet mellow taste there's even a note of green tea. I feel that this coffee isn't weak or watery in the least bit, but definitely not as bold as some other coffees I typically drink. Though you can totally tweak the intensity by how many ounces you so chose to brew as well. I typically always make the largest size available on my brewer.The RealCup capsules are compatible with Keurig K-Cup Coffee Makers and fit perfectly in my Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System. The cup itself seems very durable and I actually had to use a little more pressure than I normally do to pierce the top when preparing to brew a cup of coffee. This in turn gives me the satisfaction in knowing that these cups are staying the freshest as possible until ready to use.I found the price to be very good as is and even better with Amazon's subscribe and save! Though if you aren't sure about trying out this one, there's a variety pack available that features this flavor as well as Colombian, Peru, Costa Rica, and Brazil.  Again, I found the Ethiopian flavor to be quite good and wouldn't hesitate to have many more cups.", "\"I love a good dark and rich cup of coffee and I have found several k-cup products that deliver a satisfying cup of coffee.  This coffee is described as bold and intense and that sounded promising.  However, there is a slightly bitter taste to these k-cups that I found unpleasant.  I do use cream in my coffee so I am able to have this be my \"\"fall-back\"\" k-cup when I have nothing else in the house, but I will not be re-ordering this one.Update:  After writing this review, my husband (unaware of my opinion of the coffee) said \"\"I really like that Ethiopian coffee that you got\"\".  When I told him I found it too bitter, he was surprised and said he found it very smooth and enjoyable (he also uses cream in his coffee).  So, we may be reordering after all - but I will stick to my favorite coffee in my Ekobrew reusable k-cup!\"", "I've never tried Ethiopian coffee before this so wasn't sure what to expect.  It is actually one of the best K-cup coffees that I've had.  It is a medium to strong brew but very smooth with almost no bitterness.  I'm usually a 2 creams/2 sugars girl when it comes to my first morning cup but I've actually started skipping the cream because I just enjoy the smooth, balanced blend of this coffee.  This comes in the standard plastic k-cups and works perfectly with my Keurig brewer.  I'd highly recommend this brew to coffee drinkers.", "\"Coffee.....what a wonderful beverage for us to take delight in! It becomes more special when we consider all the regions that it is grown in throughout the world and for the myriad varieties and flavors of those varieties, offering what some may see an a seemingly endless choice of flavors, strengths, and colors, perhaps even a confusion about \"\"the Bean\"\" (coffee).At 65+ years, and having drunk coffee all my life from about 5 yrs, I feel somewhat qualified here to discuss the drink with you and to be able to give you insights here on this particular one.Nobody is really sure where it all began, but many feel that \"\"the Bean\"\" had its humble roots in, and first came to us from, out of Africa. It's interesting as many (including myself) feel that this warm dusty land produces the richest, most flavorful varieties. During the 12 years of my career that I spent in Washington D.C., a small private coffee shop was right next door, and they carried numerous regional coffees as well as \"\"popular\"\" blends, etc. Discussions, and suggestions, etc., with/from the owner and his wife brought a wider experience and knowledge to me beyond \"\"Juan Valdez\"\" if you catch my drift here. Sampling, trying, tasting were wonderful, and I found many lovely varieties and became fond of many from many locales, yet there at the heart, or basic level, I stuck around, or gravitated back to, the African coffees. Kenyan, Ethiopian, Rwandan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan have become, and remain, favorites...and are always very special amongst my \"\"go-to\"\" coffees.~~I know this is getting long here, and hope I have not lost you yet as I will bring this to a close here shortly.~~After having said all I have above, I cut to the chase, here, for this (Brown Gold) Ethiopian coffee....This is not a review mentioning \"\"essence of this\"\" or \"\"overtones of that\"\", etc.! ~It is SIMPLE. This is robust, full-flavored, dark and rich coffee...satisfying to those seeking a full bodied, dark brew. This coffee (offered here as \"\"K-cups\"\" for this brew-type machine) are not wimpily packed...they stand up to a Full 8 oz brew setting without losing any of the richness one would wish for and desire. I have pot brewed most of my life, and found these containers suprisingly capable of delivering a first rate quality cup of coffee...most impressed here with this!Straight forward, straight up, this coffee has been increasingly familiar in my pantry for some time now, of late, and with the selection as a Vine trial of these packets, I offer this review and hope it may help you or convivce you to try Brown Gold Ethiopian. It is a great favorite that I love recommending to others, and serving and sharing with my friends and guests.~operabruin\"", "This is a great coffee to drink all the time or for when you would like to have something a little different or out of the ordinary.This product brews up nicely and is very consistent. It has a pleasant and different smell and taste.K-cup brewers are quick and this prepackaged product is so easy to use! To me this is the best way to make a quick cup of top notch coffee!This coffee to me has the right amount of caffeine in it - it's not too strong and it is not on the weak side either.Enjoy. Recommended.", "\"Brown Gold's Ethiopian coffee capsules have a earthy and somewhat bold flavor. The roast is not a Starbucks or Italian Roast, more like a \"\"Full City\"\" (akin to a medium dark) roast which doesn't mask the bright, acidic notes of the coffee. This may not be a coffee for you if you like darker roasts, but it strikes a good balance between these darker roasts and more generic medium roast blends.The coffee capsules themselves are K-Cup compatible \"\"Real Cup\"\" cups. The packaging is careful to note that these are not endorsed, licensed etc by Keurig. That being said, they are virtually the same, with the exception that there is a bit more residue in the bottom of the cup.Coffee represents a large portion of Ethiopia's exports, and has a rich history in the country. This single sourced coffee is not my favorite choice, but is a nice change of pace from the Central American sourced coffees I prefer, with a distinctly different taste that is not off-putting. It may not be for everyone, but I like it - thus the 4 star ranking.\"", "Brown Gold Ethiopian coffee is a bold coffee with a mellow deep taste.  I usually prefer a French Roast or Italian Roast, so the deep flavor of the Ethiopian coffee was perfect for me.

I enjoyed it and will buy it again in the future and will look at some of Brown Gold other coffees.", "I love bold coffees and this one is good. It's not near as strong as I thought it would be but it has a nice robust flavor and no bitterness.

You won't be disappointed.", "\"This is going to be a problem product page for reviews.You need to make sure that you are reading a review for the coffee pack you wish to purchase.This review is for the Ethiopian coffee that is very different from other coffees listed.The Brown Gold Ethiopian coffee produces a firm soft tasting coffee.While listed as \"\"Bold\"\" it is softer than the normal \"\"Bold\"\" coffees.My wife is a REAL BOLD coffee drinker and thinks this is weak.I drink a Medium.This is a little stronger but a little extra Half&Half; produces a smooth creamy coffee that is tasty and relaxing.$25 for 48 K-cups is a very good price for high-grade coffee.\"", "I'm not a huge coffee drinker but hubby is.
