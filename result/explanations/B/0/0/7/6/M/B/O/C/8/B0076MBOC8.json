In some instances, such as taking waterfall pictures (I like to use polarizing filter and a 1/2 to 1/10 second exposure with low ISO - in RAW format), they are an absolute must.After years of using heavy or bulky tripods, I settled on 2 choices: when I need to travel light, I go for aPedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripodthat supports a DSLR with lens up to 6lbs. It is a perfect choice for taking indoor photographs of old churches in Europe, as an example, especially if you have a remote for your camera. The second choice, which is my preferred method, is to use my Vanguard ball tripod with its fabulous flexibility. The VANGUARDWORLD web site offers videos and thorough description for their various products.I used a  Vanguard Alta Pro 263AT Aluminum Tripod (the 264AT model has 4 extensions and is shorter when closed than the 263AT model, which only has 3 extensions) withVanguard SBH-100 Small Magnesium Alloy Ballhead with Two Onboard Bubble Levelsfor the last year and it has been a great experience - whether photographing nature or people. I lost one of the replacement quick shoes and ordered one for under $15 from Amazon. It is cheaper to buy the tripod with the ball head, rather than separately. Since my DSLR lens are not that heavy, I do not see a major difference in functionality and efficiency in using SBH-100 versus the BBH-200, even though the BBH-200 looks nicer and can support twice the load (44 lbs. vs. 22 lbs). Unlike the SBH-100, the BBH-200 does not come with an extra quick shoe. Definitely a great product - strongly recommended.", "When it comes to heads for your tripod, I believe in having both a regular ball head and also a pistol grip.I have used a variety of other brands of heads to go along with my Bogen 3020/3021 tripods for use with my DSLR and other video cameras and so, I hope with that experience, I can help those curious if product is worth your while.In this review, I take a look at the Vanguard BBH-200 Tripod Head.I. WHAT IT COMES WITH:The Vanguard BBH-200 Tripod Ballhead comes with:- BBH-200 magnesium ballhead- A 1/4 to 1/8 screw adapter- Quick shoe (where you attach the DSLR)It's important to note that the GH-200 comes with a limited lifetime warranty.II. TESTING THE PISTOL GRIP:Having used the Manfrotto MH054 ballhead, I was quite interested in seeing how the award-winning Vanguard BBH-200 would do while testing it on my DSLR, video camera and spotting scope.First, attaching the ballhead to a tripod is easy. I was so thrilled to see that a 1/4 to 1/8 screw adapter was included. I have a few Vanguard tripods that use a 1/8 screw adapter, but it's easy to remove from the base of the head and right away, I was able to place it on my Bogen tripod.I also was thrilled to see that two bubble levels are included with the BBH-200.I did a quick test with my DSLR and video camera. Panning was easy with the BBH-200. The designated bottom lever allows for quick 360 degree panning and you can lock the lever.You pretty much have easy to control to tilt or make the head go in a variety of angles, aim up or down.  Great tension thanks to the ball head and its main lock lever.The next test was to use a heavier spotting scope as the BBH-200 has a friction control system which allows for DSLR's with bigger lenses. In this case, I wanted to make sure that the device was strong enough to hold the spotting scope to the head and tightening and the head worked perfectly and held it perfectly with no tilting.Also, BBH-200 has a safety pin, so you don't have to worry about the quickshoe/DSLR falling off the head.Is the BBH-200 strong enough to hold a DSLR with a huge lens or spotting scope?  I did test it on my spotting scope and it held up quite well (the BBH-200 can hold up to 66 lbs), but I have not tried it on a huge zoom lens.  Personally, I would recommend the GH-200 Vanguard Pistol Head for its sturdiness and friction control which is very good for heavier lenses and spotting scopes.The BBH-200 also features a Rapid Level system which allows users to quickly position their camera level with the base of the head.  It takes some time to learn this but once you figure it out, it makes it easy to go from portrait to landscape in no time.  Also works well with panoramic shooting.JUDGMENT CALL:The Vanguard BBH-200 is a wonderful ballhead and cheaper than the Manfrotto ballhead MH054 and it's able to hold up to 66 lbs, where the MH054 only holds up to 22lbs.  While I own several Manfrotto heads, Vanguard is really doing a magnificent job with the release of the BBH ballheads (and also their GH-200 Pistol Ballhead).The BBH-200 definitely gives great freedom in panning and rotating various directions and for the head to be locked in place, no problems whatsoever.I think the caveat for some people is the price of the tripod head.  Personally, I feel one should own a very good ballhead that allows for fluid movement and able to tilt immediately with no problems and allowing one to get a great shot!  The BBH-200 passed all the tests that I ran with efficacy, no tension problems.  You do get what you pay for and if you are going to use an expensive camera and expensive lens, then a very good ballhead is worth the investment.The BBH-200 ballhead also looks and feels sturdy, comes with two bubble levels and another positive is that an adapter is included, so you can use it on tripods with a 1/8 or 1/4.But I know for some people, what it will come down to is price. Photography is never easy and I know a lot of people tend to want to save that money for better glass or a better full-frame camera and that's understandable. But I also believe that having a solid tripod and a solid ballhead is also important.For one looking for a ballhead that gives you better movement but is also sturdy and does the job remarkably well, then the Vanguard BBH-200 is highly recommended!", "A very high quality tripod head, solid built yet still light enough to carry around. The adjustment is very smooth and precise, ideal for taking photos for still object from different angles. Love it!", "\"So, like most people that enjoy or work with photography, I have a small stash of tripod's and monopods. Unfortunately, my less expensive tripods have had more than their share of abuse...and it shows. One just slides sloooooowly downward..no amt of tightening will keep a fully loaded DSLR straight. The other, well the other is a horror show of pinched fingers, frayed nerves and cursing. I hate the thing. It's sturdy with a lot of features I like but has a tendency to pinch...and I mean pinch hard. Last time while working with it in the dark it actually drew blood. So, between the slow slide and the pinching one, I've resorted to mainly using a monopod which was my stqandby but is the only one without major irritations.So, when this came up for review, clearly I couldn't wait to try it out. The first thing to note is that it will fit other tripods which is perfect because it is the sloppy, slipping head that needs to go on my old one not the legs. Although I will probably end up replacing the legs eventually, I love the fact that this fit with ease. Literally took off the old one and installed this one in less than a minute. Perfect fit. Viola...crummy old sliding tripod is like new.Next, this is actually smaller than expected. In fact, it was smaller than my old head despite the additional functionality. VERY smoother operation. I really like the ability to maneuver by degree -  great for panoramic shots or knitting photos together. Double bubbles - where have they been all my life?! I'll be the first to admit, without the \"\"straighten\"\" feature on most software, far too many of my photo's look like they were taken by a slightly off kilter drunk. Apparently I slant my head more than I've ever realized.Slide and lock - everything works beautifully and with ease. No more pinched fingers, love the range and NO MORE slow slipping! Weight is given at 44 lbs, clear I have no idea if it would hold anywhere near that but can say that it holds a full sized DSLR with grip, flash and larger lens(es) with ease...basically this does what it is meant to do and does it well.One problem with mine - had a light film of grease on it that took a bit to remove from my hands without getting on camera equipment. Frankly, I find this of concern especially for the long-term viability of the ball movement but only time will tell. Right off, it doesn't appear to hinder performance whatsoever and was able to be cleaned up with relative ease.While you can certainly pay more, this feels very well made and provides ample movement, flexibility and support. Best of all, if you have a decent tripod in need of a new head, the ability to exchange/replace is a huge plus and money-saver. Very pleased!\"", "\"(Note that I received theVANGUARD Abeo Plus 323AB Tripod with BBH-200 Professional Ball Head (Black)as part of Amazon Vine program.  I figured that it made sense to leave my thoughts on the BBH-200 Ball Head here as well.)I've had an evening to play with the Vanguard BBH-200 Professional Ball Head, and compare it to my current tripod / ballhead setup which includes a Markins Q10 Ball Head. In the end I'd say the Vanguard ball head isn't quite the equal of what I already have, but it is an great value for the money considering it costs less than half the price of the Markins product.Though it looks a bit different, the Vanguard BBH-200 Ball Head is functionally similar to the Markins Q10.  (The Markins Q10 isn't sold here; it appears similar to thePhoto Clam PC-44NS Pro Head with Friction Screw, Deluxe Quick Shoe, Bubble Level (Black)).  The quick shoe is attached to a large ball that rotates in a magnesium housing.  A large lever locks the ball in place (as opposed to a dial on the Markins), and a smaller lever can be released to allow the entire ball head to rotate for panorama shots.  The BBH-200 uses standard \"\"Arca\"\" style mounting plates, with a small one included with the ball head. Two useful bubble levels are included on the quick shoe.In testing with my Canon 7D and 70-300L lens attached to a tripod mount, the Vanguard has no issues holding the combo in place at any angle without any noticeable slipping or sagging. The ball head moves very smoothly with the main lock partially engaged (to provide some resistance to movement).One thing I'm not as impressed with is the \"\"rapid level system\"\". If engaged, it seems that some type of pin locks in place when the ball head is in a vertical position; the problem is that there is too much play with the lock engaged, so you'll still need to adjust the ball head manually and tighten it down with the main lock lever.One other missing feature (that is on the Markins Q10) is the ability to set a minimum ball tension, so that there is always some resistance to the camera just flopping over when the main lock is released.  In fact, with the Markins, if adjusted correctly you can use the ball head without having to tighten down the locking knob - the resistance allows you to move the camera if needed but keep the camera in place otherwise.  Now this isn't a make-or-break feature, but it might give an advanced photographer (or someone who constantly uses their tripod) a reason to spend more on the Markins.In summary, I think that the Vanguard BBH-200 Ball Head is quite good but not quite my new favorite - but for its price I think it is a deal.\"", "I wanted to get telephoto shots of a Supermoon. (A Supermoon occurs yearly when the Moon is closest to the Earth giving it the appearance of a larger size.) To get the shot, I took my tripod with a pan and tilt head outside. I got a few decent images from the shoot, but I found the pan and tilt head that I was using to be very difficult to use. It was hard to position it so that the moon ended up precisely in the center of the frame. Even worse, once positioned the pan and tilt head would drift off its position causing my image to be off center.One solution to the dilemma is to use a ball head. Pan and tilt heads do have the ability to be fixed on one axis but unfortunately they freely move the other. Ball heads are more flexible and faster to use. However their downside is that they are generally not as stable when the setting the camera in locked in position.Although I need to wait until next year to try another Supermoon shot, I did find that the VANGUARD BBH-200 Tripod Head was flexible and easy to move. Once in place, it locked well enough to provide a stable image. The VANGUARD BBH-200 includes both horizontal and vertical leveling bubbles and, even nicer, a very readable degree marker is on the base.On the downside, the ball movement is on the stiff side. This is good for keeping the camera in position. but I would have preferred a more fluid ball movement. I must admit that the Rapid Level System switch is lost on me. (This is the orange switch on the base.) I know that it is used to level and lock the camera, but my switch didn't seem to make much difference no matter which way it was switched.Also disappointing was the fact that Vanguard elected not to include any documentation on the BBH-200. Even their web site has nothing to offer other than a promotional video. I know that operating a tripod head is not rocket science, but come on Vanguard. How about including at least a pamphlet explaining the operation of the BBH-200?Despite these complaints, I feel certain that the VANGUARD BBH-200 Tripod Head will find a permanent home in my primary camera bag.", "I won't get too preachy here about using tripods, but before I review this Vanguard (BBH-200) ball head, I want to say a few words about tripods. I've been a photographer for about 40  years (wow, time flies, doesn't it?) and I can honestly say that all my photos improved vastly when I committed to using a tripod for about 90% of my photos. I've even written about this pretty extensively in a few of my books: tripods changed the way that I look at taking pictures. Tripods slow you down, give you vastly more exposure options and, this is important to me, they give you the chance to take comparative pairs (altering aperture to change depth of field, for example) with the *exact* same composition. There is no way that you can make a true comparative set of shots without using a tripod.Like most photographers my first tripods came with pan-tilt heads and while they are somewhat convenient, I hated them. The first time that I bought a good ball head (a Canon, I got for $50 in a close-out sale--I bought five of them), I was hooked. Using a ball head allows you to fine-tune the composition quickly in all directions--while using only a single knob in most cases.OK, the Vanguard head. This is a smallish lightweight head that is perfect for a dSLR (I'm using it right now with a Nikon D90 on a Manfrotto 2021 tripod most of the time--at least I think that's the model, lol). It is a surprisingly strong head for its size and I have been using it regularly with a Nikkor 70-300 f/5.6 lens--often with close-up extension tubes when shooting close-up photos. There has been no slip at all and as long as you remember to keep a little tension on it, you can even adjust position with the camera safe from slipping around. But as with any ball head, if you forget to tighten down the tension, you could be in for a nasty  sound if you let go of the camera.Much is made of the leveling feature on this head and while I don't see anything wrong with including it--and it can be convenient--it's not that big a feature for a lot of work. It is useful if you are shooting a panoramic series of shots and you want to find a quick level. And yes, it does work. you simply slide the lever and then move the head and it snaps into a level position--instantly. It can be useful. I also like the calibrations on the base of the head because the are marked out in degrees so that if you're shooting a pan, you can just look at the arrow pointer and know how much you're rotating the head. The pointer is on what seems to me to be the front of the head or side of the head (depending on you you position it on the tripod legs) and it seems to me like it would be better at the back, but I'm still playing with the head set up so I could be wrong on this point.One thing that I'm not crazy about is the camera mount since I prefer using the Bogen/Manfrotto version of the quick-plate release. This head has a vice-type mounting block and it's fine--it really locks the camera on, no question--but you have to loosen/tighten it for each removal, etc. I like quick releases that have a simple push release. But I am able to mount my quick release onto the Vanguard mounting block, so it really isn't that big an issue. The reason that I prefer a quick-release, by the way, is that  I change lenses a lot and I do a lot of close-up work, so I'm often taking the body off to change accessories and having to loosen it each time became tedious (which is why I added my own quick-release plate to it). But this is not a criticism! The vice-type mount that the Vanguard uses is very secure (if you remember to tighten it down!!!) and it's a standard mount for many heads. Again, this Vanguard mounting vice is safe and strong if you prefer this type of mount.Overall I think that for $200 this head will last you a long time and it seems very well made. It is simple to use and the release/tension levers are big enough to use even with gloves in winter (an important point with *any* head if you live in a cold area). I would have liked to see bigger bubble levels (I hate having to put on my reading glasses to see them) and that is one thing that I don't like about the head--they seem small to me, but again, probably a minor point for most users. It's hard to find a good head at this price and I know from experience: if you have a good tripod and a good head, you'll use it instead of leaving it in the car.", "\"The Vanguard BBH-200 ball head is one of the newest updates to the traditional ball heads with \"\"Arca Swiss\"\" compatible quick release plates. Before I get into the little details that make this tripod ball head so nice, let me just touch on the big reason this tripod head isn't cheap:It's a small and lightweight ball head but it's rated to support up to 44 lbs. of camera gear!!!Sure, things like \"\"Rapid Level System\"\" that allows you to quickly set your camera so the composition is level or the easy-to-use panning lock switch make the Vanguard BBH-200 a fantastic tripod head ... but the simple fact that this small, lightweight ball head and hold 44 pounds worth of lens and camera makes this head a great buy.There is a reason this tripod head has won so many awards ... and it's mainly due to that awesome build quality and durability. Usually you have to sacrifice durability and weight capacity if you want a small and lightweight tripod and tripod head: That's why so many professional nature and landscape photographers use big and heavy tripods. This BBH-200 makes it possible to pack big and heavy camera gear but only bring a small and lightweight tripod head.It's a great addition to the latest Vanguard tripods (like the Vanguard Alta Pro 283CT carbon fiber tripod legs) as well.\"", "\"There is to date a single negative (1-star) review for a Vanguard BBH Series tripod head, by a reviewer who complains that the tripod head (BBH-100) that he or she bought failed months after purchase and was \"\"cheaply\"\" and \"\"poorly\"\" made. All three BBH Series tripod heads are covered by a limited lifetime warranty, which means that should a defect in materials and craftsmanship appear in four months, four years, or four decades, Vanguard promises to make good on it.The BBH-200 is solidly constructed, quickly and easily adjusted, sturdy, ergonomically designed, aesthetically pleasing, and it has a unique rapid level system. To assure myself that the rapid level system works as promised, I checked it against the BHH-200's two bubble levels about 3 dozen times, and it does indeed work as promised, meaning that using it enables one to quickly level their camera every time. With my relatively lightweight (about 2 lbs.) Nikon D5100 with 55-200mm zoom there is no creeping or slippage after tightening the Main Lock, nor is there creeping or slippage when I use the BBH-200 with myCelestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter(about 3.5 lbs.). Nor would I expect creeping given that the BBH-200 is built to hold up to 44 lbs. of equipment.Panning is smooth, fluid and silent. Releasing the camera from the head by turning the Quick Shoe Knob Lock takes me about 2 seconds (based on several timings, and that's without rushing), and putting the camera (with the includedVanguard QS-60 Quick Shoeattached) on the head takes me about 2 1/2 seconds (the extra half second is because I usually need to look when getting the quick shoe into position on the head). The Quick Shoe Knob Lock needs to be turned about 1 3/4 turns to release and/or retighten the shoe.The BBH-200 has two knobs and one lever which can be tightened and loosened; the Quick Shoe Knob Lock and the Panning Locking Knob, and the Main Lock, which is a lever. I never feel a need to tighten any of these to the point that I feel I'm at any risk of overtightening them.There is no discernible downside to the BBH-200. Highly recommended.\"", "My only other tripod head experience has been with theManfrotto 322RC2 Joystick Head, which is a delight to use.  The ball-style tripod head seems like it would be cumbersome to adjust, but, while it's not as easy as squeezing the joystick lever on the Manfrotto, it is still easy to reasonably quickly adjust, and perhaps even easier to adjust with precision than that head.Moreover, and more importantly, this head feels ROCK solid -- a Canon 7D with a 70-200 f/2.8 lens feels comfortably secure, at any angle, when atop this head and theManfrotto 055CXPRO3 Tripod.  An impressive piece of kit!", "\"I'll divide this review into two parts. I'll give a summary for those who are familiar with ball heads, and write a longer section for those who are not familiar with tripods.This ball head is well built, solid, slightly smaller than the Manfrotto 488RC2 (replaced with 498RC2) that I've been using for the last 6 years. The quick release is Arca Swiss compatible, knob type instead of a lever. It has a pin to prevent the plate from accidentally sliding off if it is loosened while tilted. Pin is pretty small, so I wouldn't want to depend on it.Friction on the ball feels smooth and consistent. Other than two lever style locks - one for horizontal panning, the other to loosen / tighten the ball, it has a sliding switch. When slid to the right, it allows the ball and platform to be locked in a vertically upright position (you move it upright and wriggle it around until it clicks). This, together with the spirit level on the QR platform, allows for quick setup for panoramic shots. Tested with a Canon 5D III and a 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS, the ball has very little slip after being tightened when pointing down at a 45 degree angle, and almost no slip at all when pointing straight. It comes with a limited lifetime warranty to original owner (proof of purchase required when requesting service, don't throw away the receipt). The only concern I have is that much of the ball's surface is exposed - removed to save weight. I'm not sure if this would lead to more dust and other debris accumulating on its surface over time.The base can attach to either 3/8\"\" or 1/4\"\" tripod screw posts - for 3/8\"\", remove the thread adapter.It's a well built ball head that is quite reasonably priced compared to the competition. I'd say 4.5 stars, I'd give it 5 stars if it has a lever release instead of knob. If that's a non-issue for you, or if you prefer the knob, it'll be a 5 star product.OK, next comes the quick intro to tripods and ballheads part.Why use a tripod? Mainly, for sharper images. Three factors influence the sharpness of an image : the stability of the camera, the stillness of the subject, and the focusing. A tripid can help ensure the stability of the camera - both in eliminating camera shake when used with mirror lock-up and remote release, as well as in ensuring that the camera does not move between focusing and shutter release. For some shooting scenarios, like macro, low light, and long exposure, a tripod can make the difference between a beautiful capture and a blurry mess.Tripod comes in a very wide price range. The better built (translation : more stable) tripods generally are sold without a head. On most of these, you would not be able to attach the camera to it - the screw post on it is 3/8\"\" in diameter, and the tripod mount on the base of the camera is 1/4\"\". Even if you can, you wouldn't want to. You wouldn't be able to quickly reposition the camera, but will have to adjust the height of the legs to get the angle you want. Portrait mode? Forget it. Nobody does that, not unless there's a very compelling reason. Hence, the tripod head.There are a number of tripod heads for still cameras (and there are different type of heads for video cameras). This type of ball head is the most common. There are some that come with a pistol-style grip, or some other mechanism other than a knob or lever for tension control of the ball. My suggestion is to avoid them - I've tried a few and I haven't found one that I like - they don't generally grip securely enough.Just like tripod legs, ball heads come in a very wide price range. I'd say this is a medium to high end consumer grade ball head.Operation is pretty straightforward. Loosen, adjust, tighten. This ball head has two extra features : an additional lever to loosen the base, so that it can be rotated, and that orange switch you see in the photo. The switch is an interesting feature I didn't know about before receiving this ball head. Loosen the ball head, slide the switch to the right, wriggle it and it will lock with a click in the upright position. So what do you use it for? Tighten the ball head, adjust the tripod legs so that the spirit levels so that the bubble is in tje center, loosen the smaller lever to allow for rotation, and you can take perfect (well, close to perfect) panoramas.The ballhead comes with a quick release system. Nobody wants to screw the camera directly to a tripod head every time they use it. Not only is it time consuming and tedious, you also risk damaging the thread by cross-threading. All photographers I know who use tripod regularly use a quick release system. The one that comes with this is compatible with the Arca Swiss system. The Arca Swiss system is very popular among professionals because it has a very secure clamp. When tightened down, you can carry your tripod with the camera attached if you really want to, and not worry about it falling off. I've been using Manfrotto's RC2 quick release system for the last 6 years. It is small, less expensive, but it does not hold it anywhere near as securely. Arca Swiss style plates (the part that attaches to your camera's base, or to the tripod mount of large lenses) is made by many vendors. The plate by Vanguard is the QS-60.Arca Swiss style quick release comes with two types of clamps - lever and screw knob. This one comes with the screw knob. It holds more securely, but it takes longer to release.The most important aspect of a ball head is how well it grips after you tighten it, with the heaviest setup you own. Most ball heads will move slightly after being tightened. This movement is usually more pronounced when the camera is not pointing horizontally, but is tilted at an angle. With a pretty heavy setup - over 5 lbs worth of camera and lens - there is a slight movement when the camera is pointing down at an angle, and hardly any when it is pointing horizontally. Much better than the Manfrotto 488RC2 I've been using. This type of movement can be frustrating, especially when trying to shoot macros, until you learn to compensate for it. The ball head's load capacity is listed as 44 lb, but I think that would be pretty unrealistic on such a small ball head - it would be difficult to adjust. A more realistic number would be around 15 lbs, but that would include most lenses that don't require a second mortgage to pay for. And if you're using a lens that big, you probably want a gimbal head.A setup with tripod legs and this ball head will cost around $300 - $400. And you can always spend more for carbon fiber tripods. A good set of tripod and ball head will last you many years, and likely through multiple camera upgrades. You can certainly spend less, but I would be very careful about spending less than $150 total, unless you're shopping for used equipment. If possible, check this out in a store before deciding. The Arca Swiss style quick release is a nice professional touch, but it is not the most convenient to use (personally I prefer the lever over the knob). I hope this helps, and if there's anything I did not cover or if I explained poorly, please post to the comments.\"", "This is just as good as any Manfrotto that I have used.  The build quality of the this Vanguard is good and I do not have issues leaving my Canon 5DMKII with  my 70-200 attached without being by the tripod.My review is based on my initial impression of this ball head. I have had the product for a couple of weeks now.This ball is easy to use and sturdy. It is light but a great performer. Only time will tell if the ball head can hold up to longer term use  Having the large levers makes adjusting the ball head a snap.  The built in level is perfect for when I pan while shooting videos of course you want to ensure your tripod is level.As I get more use and if anything changes I will update my review. After two weeks I use I would recommend this product", "This is a nice tripod head. The materials appear to be of very good quality, everything is well machined and without any protrusions or blemishes. The main, panning, and shoe locks are well placed, easy to operate, and hold things in place securely. I've used it with a Pentax K5 + Tamron 70-200 f2.8 (it's the weightiest combo that I have) and it held lens and camera steady without a problem. The panning is smooth and needs some force applied to move it (even when fully unlocked) thus making small adjustments easier.The Rapid Level System is useful but not fool-proof. It is sometimes fiddly and you're not sure if it's locked in position. Also, even when locked in position mine does have a bit of play so you still need to look at the bubble level to make sure it's 100% vertical.The one part that I find a bit cumbersome is the screw for attaching the camera/lens to the quick shoe. You do need a coin (or something similar) as its offset position makes it difficult to turn it with just your fingers.All in all a solid tripod head that can handle most(D)SLR+lens combos.", "The BBH-200 is a high quality ball head.  It features a knob lock wheel for a quick release of your DSLR.  It came with a quick shoe pad that you can screw in at bottom of your camera for quick docking.  The quick shoe has non-slip rubber paddings to make sure it won't damage or scratch the bottom of your camera.  The quick shoe has a safety pin feature to prevent your camera from falling down if you loosen up the knob - this works as long as you don't loosen up the quick shoe all the way.The Main Lock which is the biggest knob controls the ball.  One twist to release and to lock.  This will be the knob that you will be using the most.  You can spin the camera 360 degrees as well as tilt up and down.  This will also allow you to switch from landscape to portrait and back.One big feature here is the Rapid Leveling switch.  Pushing  the switch to the right will quickly lock your camera into horizontal position.You also get two bubble levels, one for landscape and one for the portrait mode.At 44-lb capacity, it will have no problem supporting a DSLR or a good size video camera.Overall, the BBH-200 is a very solid product.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.", "\"As ball heads go, this one is feature packed and very well made. The only steel parts are the screws/threads. I don't know what the rest is, but it's strong and medium weight - I would not call it light.  The two bubble levels are nice, but I prefer the built-in level in my camera. As bubble levels go, these are also well made (albeit small) with a couple of extra features - a red ring to make leveling easier, and a center dot so you can get it exactly level. The levers are synthetic and \"\"grippy\"\". The knob for tightening the plate has a ribbed rubber insert for extra grip.  The plate also has rubber pads.The ball head locks down tight and secure - my 5D with a 70-200mm did not budge at all. The 360 degree rotation/pano base also works well. The knob that tightens the ball head actually uses a pivot clamp to grip it from all sides. Other ball heads use either a cup that presses against the ball head from the bottom. The really cheap ones use a screw to press against the ball.I'm not a fan of the \"\"rapid Level\"\" - this is simply a slider switch that raises a pin to lock the head in a straight line - not actually level it. Once engaged, there are still a few degrees of play - enough to screw up a pano shot if you don't lock the head down. That's why it's not 5 stars.I used the ball head on and off for a couple of days and am pretty impressed with it. If you wish, you can remove the plate assembly and attach your own - say if you're married to Bogen/Manfrotto plates. But the Arca-Swiss style mounting plate system is pretty darn nice. I prefer it to the Bogen ones I've been using for years, and have slowly been converting my gear over to the Arca-Swiss style.\"", "I have been an avid photographer for over 40 years but never really had use for a tripod until a couple of years ago when I became interested in HD photography.  As hard as I tried I could never get good handheld results.  I soon learned a good tripod is a must.  So I go a cheapo tripod and I have been relatively happy with it.  I have seen numerous ads for high end heads and always wondered what all the fuss was about and how could the really be worth the cost.  Well after a couple of days using this one I learned what I have been missing.  The ability to maneuver my Canon 5D is fantastically easy.  Where it really shines is doing movies.  Panning is so smooth now where on my old cheapo it was jerky.  Locking the camera position down in position it also so much easier now.  I at the point where I probably will rarely go handheld anymore.  I can't believe what I have been missing all these years.  Take my advise, get one.  This is my first so I can't really give a comparison with another one but I don't think you can do much better than this.", "\"Update: I asked a professional photographer to take a look at this head and she was very impressed. So much so that she got one for herself. She referred to it as a \"\"Cadillac\"\" of tripod heads.==========I must preface my review with the fact that I am only an amateur photographer, and I seldom use a tripod because I don't like to haul it around and set it up. This head, however, is great! It brings so much flexibility, functionality, and stability to my tripod that I will be taking it out of the closet and using it much more. Installation was a snap since an adaptor was included for a smaller mounting screw.I find this head to be very well made, easy to use (just one locking screw will allow all movement including a 90 switch from landscape to portrait), and way more than I would normally pay for simple photography (remembering that more pictures are taken with an iPhone than any other camera). But for those who don' t mind shucking out more than $150 for just a tripod head so that they can get that one perfect shot, or even more for a high-quality tripod with this head, this is certainly well-worth the investment as it is significantly cheaper than the high-end, pro stuff yet provides a great ease-of-use and quality in manufacture.The only caveat I would add to these accolades is that the pin that aligns the head at the top will allow a couple degrees of movement in all directions. The movement moves the bubble from the center of the level to a spot halfway toward touching the outside edge of the level ring. This isn't much, and it is within the standard for level, but if this bothers you, then you would need to verify level and snug down the ball clamp before taking each shot. Personally, I have not had a problem that affected my shot so dramatically that I had to call it a loss, but for a pro, this could be an issue. But then, if you're a pro, it is likely that you already have a more expensive, higher-end head.\"", "\"I previously had a cheap ball head unit attached to my gorilla pod tripod. I somehow lost them on a recent trip and wanted to replace them. I knew, though, that this time I wanted a better ball head as my previous one was a bit too basic, and I never felt that either my video nor my dslr cameras were securely attached.This ball head is worlds ahead of my previous experience. I do feel my cameras are secure, even when tilted, so I'm more relaxed using it. But, beyond that, I can tell the quality just from the feel of it, especially the smoothness of the movement of the ball head and how easy it is to stop and hold a position.Primarily, I use the ball head for photographing artwork. Since I can't always use flash or set up other lighting sources, and the artwork is not always hung at camera level, I have to use a tripod and longer shutter speeds. The ball head allows me to position the camera as needed for the painting and the swivel allows me to position my camera as parallel to the plane as conditions allow. Except when traveling, I always have it attached to my full size tripod. My only other use is for traveling, especially for videos and panoramic stills.There are many other features which this tripod offers which I don't need for art photography but I'm sure I'll find use for in travel: there is the rapid level system whereby the ball head finds perfect level by itself.  I've played with it a bit and it seems to work. The two bubble levels are a good reference to have for setting up the legs of the tripod. At least I now know that those factors that are within my control are correct. Beyond that, the bubble levels don't really help me since the works are seldom hung straight and sometimes are on an easel.This acquisition has shown me that not all ball heads are created equally. There is a difference between a `tool' and a `toy' and this is a well-built tool that--another loss excepted--will be the last ball head I ever need to get.My only complaint is the absolutely ridiculous User Manual. All the instruction is in the form of four pages of schematic diagrams and one page of text consisting of the key to the diagrams, two sentences and two very brief paragraphs. There is also a page with symbols which  give instructions such as \"\"don't sit on the ball head when it's on the tripod\"\" and \"\"if you hit the tripod with a stroller it will fall on a child riding a tricycle.\"\"  (I'm amazed that this last instruction doesn't have a line through it.)I also want to warn the potential buyer that the Quick Shoe attachment is secured to the packing sponges. Since it is almost the exact color of the sponges and doesn't weigh much, I had not seen it. I thought I hadn't gotten the piece shown in schematic diagram no. 5 as \"\"G\"\" until I went back to the box to look. Luckily, I hadn't thrown out the sponges or I never would have found it.\"", "Vanguard's BBH-200 Tripod Head is not much different from any other well made tripod head, except when it comes to it's rapid level system. I have used my Canon cameras over the years for still shots for a collectibles magazine  and have always used a better than average tripod and head to get steady, perfect photos. One of the first things I noticed with this tripod head is that it fits on not just Vanguard tripods, but a variety of others, due to it's 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch thread adapter on the base. This is a huge plus as I can use this tripod head on any of my various tripods I've accumulated over the years.The rapid level system holds the camera perfectly in it's place. There are two bubble levels which ensure the tripod's balance. The large easy grip lever lets you lock the camera securely, staying in place no matter what the angle. I found there is no accidental slipping while enabling any minor quick shoe movements with it's standard clamp (Arca type) that also contains a unique quick shoe stop button. This quick shoe stopper prevents the camera from an accidental fall, yet doesn't interfere with the quick shoe from free sliding.Even though I have mainly used my Canon cameras for still shot photography, I found this BBH-200 tripod head wonderful for videography. The 360 degree panning lock makes for really steady panoramic videos. I was impressed with the really fast still and portrait shots I took, as this tripod head can be positioned at totally accurate 90 degree angles in literally one second.  Attaching the shoe to my camera was unbelievably fast, as I just lined up the quick shoe screw with my camera, inserted the screw and you simply use a coin to tighten it on. I thought this was a bit flimsy, but it is actually not, as there is a tiny safety pin on the shoe base which prevents any camera movement.Vanguard gives this super fast and easy to use BBH-200 tripod head a limited lifetime warranty, so you are getting a great deal for your money. This tripod is a solid 4 1/2 stars, not just for being easy and fast to use, but because it fits on all my tripods, no matter what the size.", "I tested out this head with a Canon 5D3 and a variety of lenses (24-105, 16-35, 100-400, 135).  The head was comfortable to use, easy to setup and felt stable.  The only lense where I didn't quite feel as comfortable was the 100-400 (mounted on the lense collar).  This isn't to say that it didn't hold on to it, I just didn't feel as comfortable. I'm used to a bit more substantial head, so it may take getting used to.  Overall, this is a good value relative to many other ball heads out there and the weight is nice as well.I'm sure I'll get some good use out of this head and it is a major improvement for anyone using a standard head for some of the cheaper tripods.", "I previously had a Vanguard SBH-100 ball head, which I thought was perfect -- until I met the -200, which I find even better (though both are superior products in their own right).  The BBH-200 is incredibly smooth in it's adjustments, and gives any angle you could possibly want, making it incredibly easy to get your shot set up exactly as you want it.  The two bubble levels on the unit also help make you to make sure you're getting the level shot you're likely looking for from your tripod/bh setup.  I also particularly like the quick-snap feature to the head, allowing you to lock it into place very quickly if needed.  I am very, very pleased with this product, and would highly recommend it to others who are looking for a quality, well-made tripod head.  I look forward to using this over the year to come, as I'm more than confident it'll hold up to wear and tear, and continue to meet my needs going forward."], "Gamma": [0.1249992623925209, 0.1249992623925209, 0.1249992623925209, 0.1249992623925209, 0.12500521540641785, 0.1249992623925209, 0.1249992623925209, 0.1249992623925209], "Beta": [[0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727710525505245, 0.0050213523209095, 0.17189331352710724, 0.004424550570547581, 0.0010781794553622603, 0.0003405778843443841, 0.0019166846759617329, 0.001498557860031724, 0.00043706761789508164, 0.02242051437497139, 0.0007888012332841754, 0.005310078617185354, 0.005761641543358564, 0.0014177537523210049, 0.002570777665823698, 0.009904972277581692, 0.337528795003891, 0.21732911467552185, 0.0090327188372612, 0.005522939842194319, 0.1955288201570511], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302], [0.0002727709652390331, 0.005021345801651478, 0.17189325392246246, 0.004424542188644409, 0.001078178407624364, 0.00034057826269418, 0.001916689332574606, 0.0014985572779551148, 0.00043706680298782885, 0.022420629858970642, 0.0007888057734817266, 0.005310073960572481, 0.005761653184890747, 0.0014177559642121196, 0.002570774406194687, 0.009904955513775349, 0.33752867579460144, 0.21732909977436066, 0.00903270859271288, 0.005522961728274822, 0.19552896916866302]]}
