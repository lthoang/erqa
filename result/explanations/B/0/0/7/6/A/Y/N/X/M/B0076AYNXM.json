Good that I've bought this warranty that came with it, this should cover shipping to Nikon for calibration.Update: turned out that Squaretrade warranty doesn't cover items that were defective from the start, so that goes back to Amazon.Update: I've got a replacement from Amazon (very fast by the way) and the camera still has the same left focus point issues. Serial # is 3036xxx, so its basically the same batch as the one I've tried before. Though I've only tried 2 bodies, I have a feeling that all of these D800s are the same, including the D800Es. The reason why not everyone notices it is because its not that bad in real-life and you can see it clearly only under controlled conditions and with a fast lens wide opened.That being said, I'm keeping the camera. It's great otherwise, and I'm hoping to get it fixed some time in future when I send it out for sensor cleaning. I still got that Squaretrade warranty thing that should cover it. Nevertheless, the 3-star rating stays, because Nikon needs to pay more attention to their quality control, and that's the only way I can help it happen.Update: I have noticed oil particles on my sensor and had the camera shipped to Nikon for cleaning and calibration. Good thing I bought that additional Squaretrade warranty, because Nikon's warranty doesn't cover sensor cleaning. Anyway, my camera was calibrated, and now all autofocus points work perfectly.", "\"I am an owner of a Nikon D3S and D300S, both are 12MP and with fast frame rate.  I have a range of fast/pro grade lenses.  I focus mainly on landscape and [natural light]portrait. I also do quite a bit of street photography.D800 is long awaited and fit in nicely the criteria of FX sensor with the size of a D300S.There are many positive reviews of how good this camera is, and I agree.For this \"\"review\"\", I will not go through the pros and cons, the pluses and minuses of this camera.  Rather, I want to share the experience of jumping from low [12] MP, fast frame rate DSLR to one with 3 times the resolution and much slower frame rate.To manage camera blur, the rule of thumb that we were taught is to make sure the shutter speed is at about 1/focal length of the lens.  If one uses a 50mm lens, the the shutter speed should be around 1/50 of a second.  It could be slower if the lens has a VR.This rule of thumb does not work well with D800 due to the very high MP.  I didn't know that before.The first day I had it, I shoot it in a public park.  I used it with a Nikkor 50mm f1.4D.  It was a cloudy day, I shoot with base ISO of 100, Aperture prior at F/2. and my shutter speed at that time was about 1/30s.  The images at 100% was blurry.I bumped up the ISO to 200 and increase the shutter speed to 1/60s.  Still blurry but better.I gradually bumped up the ISO until it reached 400 and shutter 1/125s.  Only then the shutter speed is fast enough to stop the blur.The next day, I used it indoor with a volunteer model.  I used a SB-700 flashgun with a Nikkor 85mm f1.4G, aperture priority at F/4, and the camera selected a shutter speed of 1/60s.  Most of the images at that shutter shutter speed were blurry.  With the experience the day before, I bumped the ISO up and increase the shutter speed to 1/160s before the blur subsided.I discussed this issues with a few friends who also own D3X, they confirmed that based on their experience, it will be difficult to handhold a high MP DSLR without the shutter speed at least twice the focal length of the lens (i.e., 1/[focal length * 2]).  I did a few more testing afterward and learned that to be absolutely free of blur, the \"\"new\"\" rule of thumb for minimum shutter speed without causing a blur when using a D800 is 1/[focal length * 3]. In layman term, if you use a 50mm lens, your best bet of having a perfectly sharp image is to shoot with a shutter speed of 1/150s.  Of course, with VR, it can be slower.This camera is better suited for certain situations than others.  For landscape photography where we tend to use a tripod,you will not have the blur problems as I mentioned. But for street photography where you tend to handhold, just need to watch out the shutter speed.\"", "\"There isn't anything I don't like about this camera.  The problem is that I've grown used to DX format, and unless I want to be Barry Sonnenfeld and shoot everything wide angle, I'm having trouble re-seeing in FX format.  I like the 50-point sensor, although I expected it to get confused in some situations.  I guess respecting various shooting values from previous sensors has made me aware of how to exploit it.The fact is that I had hoped to use this for general shooting, particularly in the wild, where I prefer to shoot.  Unfortunately, I still end up opting for a D7000 and a D5100 as a backup for most outdoor shoots.  The D800 sits in a case at the studio 90% of the time, where I have all the lenses to choose the best optics for the product or person.Frankly, I'm starting to feel as if this is more a \"\"gear-head's\"\" delight than a really necessary piece of equipment.  It's fun to look at tiny details, but in the real world, this is file-size over-kill.  Nicely made.  Fun to use, but the D7000 really performs as well, and my stock agency always wants smaller files rather than larger.I've never cared about having \"\"The Biggest Gun,\"\" so although I had F5s, Hasselblads and Sinars in the film days, I also wandered around with a $700.00 Raja 4X5 in my backpack, along with a couple of good lenses, and nobody knew the difference.Ansel Adams laughed at gear-heads, and I tend to agree.  With all the technology, it all comes down to the eye, then the glass, and finally the camera...  Just saying.\"", "After hearing about this camera, I salivated over the concept of owning one for years.  And years....turns out I was salivating over rumors for most of those years.  Then Nikon announced it....with no availability.  ARGH!  Finally, six months go by, and randomly (ok, maybe not so random...like six times each day) checked availability, and Amazon had two available!  I immediately pulled the trigger, and two days later was the most reviled guy in NorCal - 'cause I had the most incredible camera I've ever used.I'm not going to ramble any more about this camera - you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't salivating over ownership...what I AM going to suggest though, is that you do some simple math - more pixels means more light required.  What I could shot on a D300 easily in, say, F4, 125, and ISO200 simply will NOT work on this.  Your shots will be incredibly dark.  But, easy fix - pump up the ISO to 800, and you're back on track.  This is pretty much the only real shooting adjustment that I had to make - it's just a great camera that produces great images.  In fact, the ONLY camera that can meet or beat this would be the....Nikon D800E.  And since I refuse to shoot video on a DSLR, I don't care.  :-)", "I've tested the D800 against the 5DIII and there is no question that Nikon has built a ground-breaking camera. I tested one belonging to a friend, then ordered one. Sadly Nikon has let customers down BIGTIME by not even coming close to meeting demand. I know two pros who had shoots planned and simply bought the 5DIII because they could get it. The greatest DSLR isn't much good if you can't buy one. IF YOU CAN WAIT it is worth waiting for.The D800 has class leading resolution, high ISO ability and the best low ISO dynamic range ever. The resolution is quite close to a medium format camera. Focus is improved even beyond the D3s. The only downside is the insanely priced vertical grip. 3rd party will make a fortune building a grip that is even better for less money.After many weeks and more time with both cameras:1) The Canon 5DIII is the better cam for JPEG shooting, but by a small margin.2) The Nikon D800 is better at RAW and by a larger margin.Both are great cams and you can't go wrong, but Nikon's D800 is the DSLR to beat this year. Canon's sensor technology is basically old hat.", "\"This particular camera body, after surviving the \"\"left focus\"\" issue has also another problem I've run into and that is a wide-spread issue with oil magically appearing on the sensor at random times.  That means, my friends, that you have to return the camera to Nikon because they haven't authorized any dealers to deal with the issue.  So, my D800 body is in the Nikon shop right now being cleaned and adjusted for the \"\"left focus\"\" issue at an estimated cost to me of $400!!!  Totally unacceptable!!!  Don't buy this turkey or it's little brother the D600 that has a known sensor dust in the left upper corner issue that Nikon refuses to deal with as well.Nikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)Update:Talked to an anonymous source at Nikon and that person recommended that I purchase Copper Hill's basic kit to avoid the 3-4 week mailing, repair, and return time to Nikon to clean the sensors on my new cameras...he** of a note, wouldn't you say?  I'm not stupid.  I went to the web site and purchased the cleaning kit, but I shouldn't have had to do that with a brand-new pair of Nikon bodies.\"", "Ease of use, construction. I am a proam photographer shooting like a pro worth the money. an item that just work like it is suppose too.", "I migrated to the D800 after my D700 got lifted. It was a bittersweet migration, but it felt like the D700's younger, smarter, more muscular half-brother. It was familiar but at the same time a bit foreign. The features that I was used to were there and then a few new ones. I spent several weeks getting used to the menus and quirks.I'm impressed with the image quality and the focus issues I've heard about I haven't encountered in the wild much. The video is also impressive. Live view absolutely kills the battery, though. Seriously fast.One issue I have continuously is accidentally hitting the Quality, ISO and WB adjustments. It caused me to shoot JPGs for about an hour without realizing it. Not cool.", "\"I own the nikon d700 for a year and half and was looking forward to upgrading my nikon bodies. I intended to get the d800 and the d600. I did many research into these bodies. Finally it was down to decision time, knowing that the d800 has left focusing issue, I still went ahead and bought the d800 and the d600 hoping that I won't get a bad copy because the d700 is such a \"\"reliable\"\" and a great camera. I was giving the nikon brand the benefit of the doubt. Well what do you know, some of the focus point on the left side of the d800 miss focus consistently. Return it back immediately.  The first 4 digit of the serial number is 3008 in case anyone wonders.A customer spending this much money on a product from nikon should have the peace of mind of buying a quality product.Nikon no longer stands for what it used to be. When I wanted to buy the d700, i bought the d700 within an hour of wanting to buy one.  When I wanted to buy the d800, it took me two(2) weeks to do research.  Pondering if I should get one or not.The entire chain of command within nikon is tarnishing what this brand stand for.  I have tried written review on the official nikon usa site for this camera and was rejected twice.  Of course my review gave them a one(1) star.  What a surprise, what a surprise.  Not only Nikon doesn't care about the quality of their pro dslr, their loyal customers, they now try to hide their mistakes by not approving critical review.  So don't even trust the rating from Nikon's site.  Don't even trust this brand any more.I am a very disappointed nikon loyal customer.I now own a Canon 5d Mark iii.\"", "It's almost impossible to find the proper words to express my enthusiasm for this amazing technical wonder. The ergonomics are perfect, the color rendition is amazing and the sharp, crispness of the images it produces are astounding. It's truly love at first shoot.", "\"I have owned many digital cameras over the years and this one is simply the best. But having said that it is not a camera for all.You will need a lot of horse power in your PC or Mac and plenty of hard drive, and be thinking about backups, to really use the files from the D800. Files are large and especially if you are shooting raw. And if you are outputting files in TIFF format, those can run over 200MB. Needless to say, you don't need to work at the highest resolutions, but then why did you buy a 36 MB camera? Perhaps a D7000 or D600 would be a better choice.Anyway, the Nikon D800 is just the best camera I have every used. In fact I was using a D3x to shoot some indoor material with mixed lighting and the results were not consistent... the white balance was a real problem. I re-shot everything with the D800 and the results were amazing. Set on Auto white balance the D800 \"\"got it right\"\" about 90% of the time, and the other 10% were close enough to fix in post-production. Again and again, I have gone to the D800 over my older D3x. Granted the D3x is easier to use with more external controls, but the D800 is now my \"\"go to\"\" camera for all my shoots.If you need the resolution, or just amazing results, the D800 is your camera.BTW: I don't do that Canon vs Nikon thing. Years ago many of us made a choice and investment in one manufacturer's lens and accessories, and changing is not a sane option.\"", "I've had my D800 for less than 2 weeks and so far I am happy.  here is my backgroundI've owned D700 (several samples), D7000 (several samples), D300 (several samples), D90, D80, D40, D40s, D60 in NikonI've owned 20D, 30D, 40D, 7D, XSI, T1i, T2i in Canon.D700 is a brilliant camera, incredible AF, incredible low light shots, fast fps with grip (8),  scene recognition in auto mode, built like a tankD800 takes spectacular photographs in either JPEG or RAW.  the AF is at least as good as D700.  Scene recognition in auto mode is even better, it essentially focuses on the face.The worst camera from the top tier consumer and prosumers in terms of AF is D7000..  I have gone through several of them.  The AF Module on D7000 is inferior to D300/D700/D800.  D7000 was the only latest Nikon where I experienced AF problems in low light.  Never with D300 or D700.  D7000 - yes.  Problems with continuous AF when shooting White Birds on Contrasty Background - D7000 - YES,  D300/D700/D800 - no.The only things I am kind of not loving on D800 -  the AF switching was changed from D3/D300/D700 way to D7000 way , where you have to now press the button and scroll one of the two wheels and you have to think which wheel does what.  I liked the levers of D700, simple two levers controlled everything.  But I guess I will have to get used to it.  The second thing I am not happy about is 4FPS.  And the third is of course - the battery life went down significantly from D300/D700.Everything else, including the new Auto-ISO feature is brilliant.  it basically now accounts for VR in lenses, where you can control how aggresive auto ISO is depending on the lens you use.  If you don't have VR you may want it to select faster shutter speeds, if you do have VR, you can set it to select slower shutter speeds.  You can turn off Auto-ISO via the wheel without having to go into menu.5DM3 is a great camera too.  I think the AF is pretty similar.  AF has to do with not only the Camera but lenses.  The truth is that Canon's USM on their top lenses is just brilliant and they focus incredibly fast.  Just try the old 24-70 on any of their bodies.  Nikons' AF-S SWF is pretty fast but not as fast as Canon's USM.  On balance though, both 5DM3 and D800 will do brilliant job for you.This review is obviously only based on less than 2 weeks of use.  I will update it later as I get more experience with D800.EDITAnother couple of weeks went by and I used D800 more.  Loving the results.  I am starting to get used to new way of changing AF and it is working pretty good.  I took the camera to a very dark restaurant with 50mm 1.4G lens which everyone seems to be hating these days on D800, and got many great pictures in very dark conditions.  The only problem I see is that poor battery life.  I took about 500 pictures with very little live view and one or two short videos and my D800 shows only 33% of battery left.  That projects to me under 700 photos per battery life.  I was able to routinely shoot way over 1000 shots with D300, D700, and even D7000.  So I don't know what is going there, but I am going to have to purchase another battery.", "I'd like to thank those people who gave this one and two stars.  It's good to see technically competent people posting the truth.  I am waiting for my D800 at this time and have now thought of going back to Canon cameras.  After also looking at the D7000 Nikon quality seems to have gone downhill fast.  I'm going to cancel my D800 back order today.Those who wish to flame this post with your lame comments feel free.  It just gives away your knowledge of photography and the equipment you use.", "\"I been a Nikon user now for over 20 years, I have a D700 for over 4 years and a few other Nikon Digital cameras I use at times.  I finally sold my faithful F100 film camera after buying the D700.  Needless to say up until recently I use the D700 almost on every outing; and love it - it is a wonderful camera that does a fantastic job at digital photography.Now I have a D800! So the first thing I notice is the layout and build difference; the D800 is not as ergonomic and slightly smaller bodiedThe build materials of the D800 are of similar composition as compared to the D700 but the D700 feels solid and less plastic than the D800.Overall, it does not take too much time to get use to the new layout as most buttons and dials are similarly placed ad do the same functions.Image quality of the D800 is for most all circumstances remarkable and this comes at the cost of larger file sizes.-- Media management becomes critical when your talking about 38mb + per shot - your storage solution and backup plans need to keep up with the file size increase.The benefit of larger resolution is you have better cropping options. Meaning, photos can be zoomed in to show more details.The main feature I was looking for with this camera was to use it for my Macro (MICRO) photography - bugs and plants, so having more resolution is better.I decided to go with the D800 vice D800E after many months of research, the simply fact is not that much difference between the two and I simply don't want to deal with the moire issues.Not that the D800E has Moire issues, I simply don't wish to increase my probability of running across subjects that would create moire.  I will stick with the D800 for now.Things I worry about as an outdoor photographer - DUST. With a sensor now having this many pixels packed on. It would be obvious to deduct dust would be more of a problem.Good thing - if you are using Nikon pro lens they have a weather seal where it attaches to the camera, and the camera itself is moisture and dust resistant. Time will tell.Movie Mode: This has been around for awhile, and the D800 has some nice features with many shooting modes to choose from, such as 24 frames for that indie look. The movie features are comparable to any of the other PRO DSLRs out there just youtube it. The D800 has continuous focus and supports external mic in and does a great job with movie production.Overall I am pleased with the D800 Camera and the initial performance.Unlike others I don't put a camera under a microscope and go looking for defects unless a problem impacts my shooting, then I look for the root cause and have it addressed.  So far I don't see any issues, focus or otherwise.Finally, I appreciate the ability to set up a \"\"My Menu\"\" in the camera; with the press on on button I can go direct to my menu to make changes to some of my favorite settings without having to go to the main menu and drill into sub menus.  Overall the menu system works pretty well and things are laid out reasonably well + you can re-program buttons to perform other functions.Now for the whining;The D800 is a great camera for those that can afford it, and had the D4 offered more resolution (24mp) I would have invested in that over the D800.I do feel the D800 is about $800.00 over priced as are all the pro level Nikon cameras, but people don't want their older Nikon cameras devalued so Nikon keeps trucking along with overpricing.\"", "I know doing a review here would trigger the Nikon fans. If I do this same review on the 5D Mark iii it would have been the opposite. You can see it on the feedbacks. I will try to be as objective as I can even after I got burned dumping the Nikon equipment and switched to Canon. This has been my weeks of research finding the right full frame DSLR. First I like to state that I was a Nikon D90 owner and has been extremely happy with it. The reason I started with Nikon as my first DSLR was because Nikon had lower noise on high ISO compared to Canon and I was not impressed with Canon's mega pixel hype. My research was targeted to 2 DSLR, Nikon D800 and Canon 5D Mark iii and I was determined to get the full frame with higher quality still image. I went through at least 90% of the video reviews online for the D800 and Mark iii, so this is going to save you many nights of research. I was a Nikon fan but I ended up with a Mark iii and since have not looked back after I've confirmed my findings, comparing my Mark iii with my friend's D800.1. More mega pixel, more noise. Nikon just shot themself on the foot getting into the mega pixel race which Canon used to play. The D800 has noticeable noise level than the Mark iii when compared at 12k or higher ISO. I shot photos of green leaves on an indoor plant when I did the side by side comparison.2. Auto white balance under fluorescent lighting shows a greenish tone on the D800 which looks very unnatural. Even after I played with it by adjusting the Kelvin, I could not make it better than the Mark iii image taken under the same condition with Auto white balance.3. Moire on video on the Mark iii is slightly better but only if you compare the 2 videos side by side.4. D800 shows more detail outdoor, or indoor with tons of light. I would buy the D800 if I need the mega pixel badly but it has no use for me other than chewing up my memory and slowing down the frame rate. The D800 has to wait for 2 minutes for the buffer to clear after shooting about 15 continuous frames. The Mark iii kept on going but at a much slower rate. At least the Mark iii was still usable while the Nikon was not responding at all.5. Focus on the Mark iii is faster than D800. The D800 does hesitate a bit whereas the Mark iii was push and click, yes it's scary fast.6. Canon video has more accurate white balance and this carries on to the Mark iii. If you do video, Mark iii is a no brainer. The video was also a lot sharper than my Canon M52 which incorporates the 1/3 inch sensor, the big camcorder uses. Again a no brainer if you are a cinematographer.7. Most people are using the camera for sports, family, wedding and not landscape and the Mark iii is better for those applications.8. Nikon however is coming out with the D600 that may improve ISO over the D800 since it is going to be much lower mega pixel. Update: D600 proves to have more ISO noise than D800.I have switched to Canon because of my need but it does not mean you have to. It all depends on your need. If you are a landscape photographer or wants to blow up your photo extremely large with more mega pixels and you have plenty of lights, stick with Nikon. If you are a cinematographer, sports, wedding or simply indoor photographer go with the Mark iii. Canon is not always going to be better than Nikon and Nikon isn't always going to be better than Canon. But I can honestly tell you, for now this year Canon has stepped up and broken the ISO barrier. It has caught up with Nikon's low noise technology after 2 complete product cycles. What took Canon so long, I have no idea. I am hoping Nikon will come up with something better next year but for now their strategy, isn't better technology instead they will be focusing on prices. It is working, look at the D800 back orders. Is Nikon going to lose the war to Canon, no so fast, watch for the D600 which is the next sign of full frame price war. Within 2-3 years, full frame cameras will be average pro-summer cameras, no longer pro. The Sony Nex 7 is another example, mirror-less, smaller body, big crop sensor, big lens, point and shoot. Pro is going for much bigger sensors than 35mm. Buy full frame lens, I predict the crop lens will eventually be something casual moms will be using and the price will drop significantly because they will be produced in much larger quantities.Update, I was wrong about Mark III not have any moire issue at all. The other day I was reviewing my video, I notice a bit of moire not as noticeable and much better than D800. So far all the cameras I researched have moire issue some better than others. I was paying attention to all the movies and noticed the cameras Hollywood uses all have some sort of moire issue. After the Cine Gear Expo, I noticed something which you should greatly take into consideration. Canon has a flag ship of video cameras including the 1DC and the C500 and Nikon had none. What that tells me is Nikon is very behind on the video part. How does this affect your decision to stay with Nikon when it is only still that you are concerned about? Video has become a very import integrated feature in the DSLR and sooner or later it will be important to you. Example is that you can sneak in a nice video of a family gathering in between stills. By staying with Nikon and continue to invest on the lens would lock youself into a company that is falling behind on technology. I said this on Kodak in 1993 when I purchased my first Olympus digital camera. The only way Nikon can fix this problem is to stay in the prosummer market with great prices. The D800 is another sign that Nikon is selling on price whereas Canon does not have to. If you are serious enough about photography and you are going to invest a lot of money in Nikon equipment in the long run think carefully and not get caught up on the Nikon/Canon rivalry which I can care less. I spoke highly of Nikon when I had the D90 which has better ISO than the T3i at the time time and the Canon fans were attacking me. But now the market has changed, Canon has uncovered Nikon's ISO secrete and the Mark III has better ISO than the D800. Canon is also the leader in the video technology that is becoming increasingly important on DSLR. Canon has about a 3 years lead on Nikon when it comes to video and Nikon will likely not catch up for decades. Bet on Google or Yahoo? It is pretty obvious now but it wasn't 15 years ago. Come back to my review 10 years later and it will be very interesting to see the outcome. Oh, I would not have switched to Canon if they never could crack Nikon's ISO secrete. It took Canon 2 product cycles to catch up but I think the video technology is much more complicated and takes decades to develope. My 2 cents, hopefully save your investment or not, we will see.The D800 is sharper under daylight condition due to more pixel count and better DR but with a few issues when the it gets darker or when it shoots video. Both focus really fast but the Canon has less hesitation during focus. The D800 ISO noise when compared to the Mark III is about 2 stops off, see Kai's comparison video, he is correct. This is mostly due to the higher pixel count and the fact that Canon has uncovered Nikon's secrete technology in lower ISO noise. The frame rate is slower than Mark iii, due to the processor has to process more data and the buffer suffers greatly as a result. Nikon should have put in a larger buffer memory chip, see the cowboy video, he is right that the D800 literally freezes after serveral continous frame shots. In addition the D800 has serious moire issue especially when shooting video. The Mark III does have some moire (There is a video claiming Mark III has no moire issue which is totally false, search Moire mark III D800 on youtube) it just has the least amount, among the DSLR but it is still there. WB is way off under indoor lighting on the D800. Even in Lightroom, I find it difficult to correct. Canon is got the WB down, no Lightroom needed for most shots. However the D800 does have higher pixel count which gives you a higher resolution image to work with for magazines.. etc. Make sure there is plenty of light, either shoot in day light or with adequate 5k lighting at night or you will be disappointed with the ISO noise or WB problem. If you are sports or wedding photographer or a casual walk-around shooter who often has to work with low nature light, the Mark III is a clear winner. If you are in landscape or shooting models under controlled lighting, the D800 is the winner. I have verified most of the trusted D800 vs Mark iii comparison videos on Youtube which basically have reached the same conclusion. The Nikon is excellent on crop sensor DSLR, the D7000 and the D90 beat the living crap out of the Canon T3i, T4i. This is a unbias review because I actually tested them side by side. Ownership creats bias opinion and you probably already own a D800 doing a review here. What you are shooting determines which camera to use. If you are not getting into full frame by all means go with Nikon, if you are into full frame and got the extra $500 and you are not landscape or model photographer go with Canon. Canon has made amazing advancement in full frame but clearly dropped way short when compared to Nikon on the cropped sensors DSLR. I know this for a fact, because I own the D90, D40, D7000, D5100, T3i and T4i. I have to reiterate that the Nikon crop bodies are way better than Canon. Why do we own so many cameras? Because, we have to choose the best one for our aerial quad and octocopter equipment. For semi pro aerial shots such as real estates, I would go with D7000 with a Hexa or quad which can lift a full frame. For pro shots such as Red Bull promotion, I would go with Mark III with an Octocopter. The D800 is a clear disappointment at least for me, plagued with WB, moire issues. Also the QA on Nikon has dropped significantly due to Nikon focusing on quantity delivery instead of quality. Canon is able to maitain the good quality status under this very competitive environment.Update: D600 turns out to have more ISO noise than the D800. I was under the impression that less mega pixel is going to improve on ISO. Nikon is really falling behind on the ISO technology which they used to be a leader. Nikon still clearly wins on crop sensor bodies but trails on full frame to Canon. This is a D800 review so the one star for the lost leader in full frame. If this is a D7000 or D90 crop bodies review Nikon would get a 5 stars and Canon would get 1.Updates 12/4/2012The Nikon truely shines with its built-in flash as it comes quite handy for fill-in flash. It also has better dynamic range than the Mark II. I am raising my stars to 4. This camera however can not be used as business for video due to heavy moire issue. The 5D Mark III is the only DSLR I found that has the least amount of moire.", "\"_*********************************************************** Update 04/15/2013: This update is for event shooters/photojournalists.** Enthusiasts, hobbyists, still life and landscape professionals can skip down to my original review below and call it a 5-star camera.**********************************************************After a year of ownership with three bodies, these are my final thoughts.  This is the best landscape or studio DSLR in the market.  Other than not having a mode dial with Custom User Settings (U1, U2) like the D7000, this camera has near perfect ergonomics.However, I do not recommend the D800 for paid work that have once in a lifetime moments, such as capturing the first kiss at a wedding or truly spontaneous moments, because there is a high probability of missing focus.  When situations have no do-overs, equipment inadequacies are not an option.  This is the reason why I stopped searching for a \"\"good copy\"\" of the optically superior Sigma 35mm 1.4 and settled for the more reliable Canon.I have had both bodies and a replacement body (serial 3041XXX) \"\"fixed\"\" by Nikon and they felt the last fixes were good enough.  Good enough, I did not invest $18,000 into a system for good enough!  Without getting into the whole left side autofocus (AF) saga, which is readily available on other reviews and websites, the AF is horribly inconsistent even with the latest firmware (A: 1.01/B:1.02) using the center AF sensor.My percentage of focused photos took a massive dive with this camera; I tried compensating by closing down the aperture a few stops, but the increase in depth-of-field area was not always enough.  With the D3/D700, I would wait for moments and capture it with one shot.  The D800 missed focus often enough that I began shooting in spray n' pray style, however, often the focused photo was not what I wanted.  Creating the dilemma, do I give the client a great moment that is out of focus by meters or a ho-hum moment in focus?  When I owned the D3 and D700, I used to shoot 500-1000 photos per event, I was taking 3,000-5,000 photos with the D800.  This MASSIVE increase of photos created a workflow nightmare and my quality of work suffered (subjects centered, ISO's in the 12,800-25,600 range to allow for smaller apertures).Autofocus problems only get worse when in AF-C, if shooting a person walking towards the camera at a slow to medium pace in the F/1.4-2.0 range, expect 1 out of 10 perfectly focused, 1-2 acceptable, and the rest throwaways.  Stop down to F/5.6 and at best it's 50/50.  I took a huge financial hit switching to Canon (selling used, buying new), however, my two Canon 5D MkIII's get 7 perfectly focused, 2 acceptable, and about 1 throwaway running the same test of a person walking towards the camera. Stop down one or two stops for near perfect results.Nikon does many things better than Canon.  In body AF Assist Light, intervalometer, spot metering based on AF point, intelligent Auto ISO, better AF position selector, better access to flash options, and many more.  Overall, less menu digging, and obviously Nikon's megapixel advantage is nice for cropping.The ten plus (I actually lost count) trips to Nikon service centers can attest just how much I wanted this camera to work.  Nikon customer service is beyond atrocious and their technicians are incompetent.  Maybe a few years into production, new D800s will be adequate, but I will never know because I do not see myself buying Nikon again.The Canon 5D MkIII's sensor has less dynamic range, 1.3 bits less color space, but those 24 bits it does have are beautiful colors that require less post-processing for nice skin tones.  Because I am confident that the AF will not miss, I am now shooting 300-600 photos per event, that plus less time in post.  My turnaround went from 4-6 weeks (culling missed focus photos and fixing color) to only 2-7 days with the inferior Canon.  My clients are happier because they are getting their photos fast.  In the end, I prefer focused images taken by an average sensor, than a blurred images taken with a sensor with all the dynamic range and megapixels in the world.BOTTOM LINE:The D800 is perfect for photographers that shoot landscapes with Zeiss lenses, people that like having subjects perfectly centered, or autofocus then recompose photos in the F/5.6-11 range.  However, if you shoot wide open with fast primes and not getting the \"\"shot\"\" puts yourself or company at risk, look into another camera.  If my livelihood did not depend on camera equipment, I would have stayed with Nikon.  However, in my line of work there are no do-overs, thus the Nikon advantages gave way to its faults, and after struggling with Nikon's abysmal QC and CS in recent years (SB-900, D7000, D300s, three D800's, 28mm AFS 1.8, 35mm AFS 1.4) and reading about D600 issues.  I will not be buying a Nikon for work anytime soon.********************************************** Original Review*********************************************Below are my observations after one month of ownership.Pros:-----+ Resolution:  Amazing detail when shot with the right glass and settings.+ Dynamic Range:  Incredible, when shooting in lower ISO's it is near impossible to ruin a photo.  Search the internet for \"\"fred miranda d800 review Yosemite\"\" to see real life comparisons.+ Color:  I recommend creating custom profiles using aX-Rite ColorChecker Passport Softwareor Adobe DNG profiler for better than Adobe LR colors.+ AutoWB:  Works well in about 70% of lighting scenarios, somewhat better than the D3/D700.  *** See Tip Below ***+ Low ISO:  Having a true 100 ISO is godsend for on-location lighting setups or shooting wide open in daylight.+ High ISO:  The D800 and LR4 do an excellent job in controlling noise.  Using PS plug-ins a properly exposed image can print acceptable 8x10's at ISO 12800 (max for D3/D700's is 6400).+ Tonality:  With a good camera profile in LR4, the tonal range rivals Fujifilm 400H Film.  This is incredibly useful on portraits with 4-1 or greater lighting ratios.  Posterization in the shadows (DSLRs Achilles' heel) is only noticeable on highly manipulated images.+ Handling:  The Auto ISO is easier to engage and the new position of the ISO button is more intuitive.+ Exposure:  Better than D3/D700, but far from perfect.  Contrary to Nikon's literature, it struggles with backlit scenes.+ Battery Performance:  It can get me through a full day's shoot if I avoid extensive LiveView or WiFi use, otherwise I need to use a backup battery.Cons:------ Software:  Nikon software can produce excellent results, but it is clunky and slow.- Handling:  Awkward placement of the mode selector button (to make room for movie record), lacking the D7000 U1/U2 style custom banks, switching of AF modes is not as effortless as the D700.- Autofocus: All 51 points are still too centrally located, no increase in cross-type sensors over the D3/D700, all the cross-type AF sensors are in the middle, like the D3/700, the outer sensors are near useless in low lit, low contrast situations.  * For more details on AF performance, see update above and commentsSummary:Using proper technique, the images this camera produces are superior to any camera I ever shot.  Would I jump systems for this camera?  If I owned a large collection of top-tier gear, NO!  Otherwise, I would consider it if I was not too invested.  Does it equal or better Medium Format?  There are differences in perspective, defraction limits, DOF, FOV, and CANNOT BE COMPARED.  Having shot Canon (AE-1, 630, A2, Elan II, 20D, 40D, 5D mkI & mkII, 1D's), Nikon (FM, F4, F100, D200, D300s, D7000, D700, D800, D3), Fuji (S3, S5), Mamiya (645, RB67), and Hasselblad (H4D-40), I know that they are excellent tools that are capable of creating amazing images.  Pick the one that best fits your needs and have fun shooting.*** TIP *** To improve WB (green cast), use the WB Fine-Tune (pg. 149) and shift Magenta 1 or 2 points or use a X-Rite Passport for every scene change.\"", "I have been a canon shooter for many many years.  Nikon was preparing to take on Canon & medium format at the same time. When I starting looking to upgrade my 5D MK2 of course I looked at the 5D mk3. However I never followed Nikon much and did not know about the D800/D800E. So it just popped up on screen while searching some online stuff about the 5D mk3. When I saw the specs I thought it was too good to be true. So I watched many videos, and looked at many photos. After reviewing all these things I decided to rent a D800 with Nikkor 85mm, and 50mm 1.4G's.I was completely blown away! The image resolution is unmatched! There isn't a camera or DSLR under $12k that even comes close to this resolution and package! After rental time was complete I listed all my canon gear and lenses and purchased a D800E. I will write a review for the D800E on that page, you can view that one over there. The D800 has no moire issues at all. I shot landscape, portraits, clothes, indoor, and buildings. I shot wide open, and 14-24mm and never had any issues. Focus was great, my rental did not have any negative issues whatsoever.If you are looking to get a new DSLR this is the one to get! If you are shooting Canon like I was, then it is still definitely worth the switch!Video Mode: The video mode has a histogram instead of a EV meter, which is actually more accurate. I love the D800 for video. It is FANTASTIC! It has clean HDMI out!! It has a CF card and SD card slot, you can use them as duplicate, overflow from one to the other, or one for photos and one for videos. The D800 has built in HDR mode and timelapse as well as bracketing of up to 9 photos!! It can also go from 1/3 of a stop up to 2 stops between each exposure! WOW!Time lapse photos can also be turned into a 1080p/720p movie!! In the camera! Nikon has really delivered the goods this time around! I took a picture @ 16mm of my neighbor across the street and when I zoom to 300% I can read his window sticker on the front door. Thats how much information the D800 stores!! His house is 150-200 feet away! Impressive for 14mm I do say so!Pros = EverythingCons = Still thinking......Buy one, and you will absolutely fall in LOVE!!Corey BenoitFaymus Mediafaymusmedia.comcorey@faymusmedia.com888-864-1370", "D800 is my first full frame camera, which I wasn't thinking full frame to be necessary because of good flash is able to handle low light condition, which seems the most key reason for people to choose full frame.However, I was wrong......, and D800, full frame camera provides more than what I through.1. Double megapixels (36.3MP) on double size of sensor (FX vs DX) It gives super details comparing with my current DX camera.  Especially when we can see details of eyes when taking portrait pictures.2. It can still take pictures during movie recording.3. Video recording up to 30 mins.4. DX Lens mode for increased distance, specially working prefectly for my Nikon 28-300mm (42-450mm DX mode) Lens, when I need distance support.5. Autofocus, I thought it might be not good, but it's quick with providing more focus points.6. Memory buffer, it has enough to catch around 20 on-going pictures.7. Storage, support both CF and SD UHS-1 (95MB/sce).Some concerns......1. MB-D12 Price, it looks like MB-D11 (D7000), but the price is way higher than MB-D11.2. 4 frames/sec, it might be good to increase to be similar as D7000 (6 frames/sec) and D800 dose have good memory buffer. Not sure why it cannot do that becasue of megapixels too huge (but memory buffer is good) or Nikon marketing plan to show the difference with D4.Overall, it's an awesome camera with out standing specs.  Hope to have more tests and update later.  Enjoy!", "It's hard to know where to begin really. This camera is simply awesome. Resolution is incredible. I got the D800, not the D800e, primarily because it was available and the D800e was not. However, without a tripod it is hard to imagine a shot where the lack of the anti-aliasing filter on the D800e could produce a higher resolution picture. The quality is so high, and the resolution so good on the D800 that I think you'll get camera shake and off-focus issues before the anti-aliasing filter would start blurring anything.The user interface is very good. Coming from the D200 (which I loved) via the D300 (which I did not) it's a homely feel and all the buttons are where I want them to be. LiveView on this one is simple to use, unlike on the D300. The one thing I really like is that the focus point selector is far enough to the right to be out of your way while holding the camera. On the D200 I had to lock it to avoid moving the focus point with my nose. That doesn't seem to happen with the D800.I have not noticed any green casts, nor any left focusing issues on mine. It came running the latest firmware, so it may have been fixed already.I've played with HDR on it, and it is perhaps the greatest initial disappointment. First, it won't work with RAW format. I'd have expected it to simply save the output as JPG, but it won't even turn on if set the camera to shoot RAW. Second, the few shots I took were all underexposed. I have to play with this a bit more and perhaps learn it, but after a few tries I went back to the old bracketing+photomatix solution. Active D-Lighting may be the solution if the contrast is not too great. It appears to post-process the shot to lighten the darker areas a stop or so.Lightroomwill do the same in a heartbeat though.A minor nitpick is the high price of theUSB 3.0 Cable. It comes with one, of course, and it is fast, but branded replacements are expensive. Fortunately, it is backward compatible with a USB 2.0 Micro-B cable so if you have youra standard Kindle cableyou can still transfer pictures. Or get athird-party replacement.Overall, a great camera, perhaps the greatest.", "It is leaking lubricant or oil on the 2nd replacement body.... see update below!1st I did was to test the left focus to see if I have the problem as some people reported.  I tested it on all 6 Nikon lens (24mm (D), 60mm (D), 85mm (D), 300mm(D), 17-55mm (DX, G) and a 24-120 zoom (G)) and am glad to find out that i don't have any of the issue that others mentioned.  It is either Nikon had fixed it or the problem is lens related.  (Likely through the lens data...)The detail record on D800 image is just incredible.  (I don't really think I need a D800E to see that)  The movie capture quality is really good when paired with a VR lens for personal use.  However, the size and weight of lens + camera have made it hard to pan it for the video purpose.  The focus in movie mode is relatively slow compare to the photo mode and made a lot of noise that is audioable in recording.  I ended up using a monopod with quick release and a external mic for video shooting and it helps a lot.  On the photography side, the high ISO capability of the D800 has greatly improved over the D200.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the D800.UPDATED 4/27:It is unfortunately, the the image sensor has the infamous oil deposits on it.  It is not easy to see when doing a still images.  However, when shooting video footage it became very easy to see when panning the camera around bright sences.  I had order a replacement from Amazon... Buying from Amazon is probably the safetest way to purchase an expensive item.Updated 5/1:I have received the replacement camera body. Checked the autofocus on the left and right on all my lens. I can't detect any issue.  Pointed the camera to the bright lamp with f22 to check for any oil spot on video footage. I didn't found any oil or black spots but surprising I found a batch of dead sensor.  On video footage it is like a firefly flashing red and yellow. The dead pixel can be verified on the full frame still picture also, once you know where to look for it. 30 minutes later I deceided to check it again before I pack it up and send it back Amazon.  To my surprise, it is not showing up in the new video footage I inspected.  The only possible explaination is that the imaging sensor of the camera was not working properly earlier. (electronically or mechanically)  The body was quite warm as it was baked inside the UPS truck under Flroida sun.  I have decided to keep it for now.  However, I would have to take the chance that those pixels may have shorter life span than the rest of the sensor.updated 5/04:After a 2 second high speed continuous shooting (4 fps of total of 8 shots), both the black spot and oil spot appear on the image and video footage.  The built in low pass filter cleaning mode could not remove neither spot.  The solid debris appear black against background.  The oil or liquid spot will appear bright against background with dark hallow around it.  It is very clear when shooting with small aperture, f/11 and up.  It is a design flaw to have thin low pass filter that allows dust be so close to the focus plane.Final verdict 5/27:I have decided to keep it. The picture quality is good and video performance are also quite well.  I end up buying a couple lenspen sensorklear to clear the new found oil spots.  To minimize the risk of sensor contamination, it makes every lens change an uneasy task.  No zoom while in live view.  Turn off live view immediately when not in use.  Limiting continuous shooting (CL or CH).  Prepare to clean the sensor yourself.  If you can live with all that, then you should be fine with it and be a happy purchase.  Otherwise, get a D600 and save a couple thousands toward D4 when they test  and proof out all problems here on D800 and D600 customers.", "I am very happy with the large sensor and high ISO capability of this camera.  Only thing I miss in this camera is the ability to use the Nikon ML-L3 Infrared Wireless Remote for the shutter.I checked mine out and I'm fairly sure that I don't have the left focus problem that a few owners have experienced.  I did have the back focus problem with my D7000, but Nikon fixed it for me and got it back to me in a little over a week.  So I feel assured if I run into a problem that Nikon will take care of it.I'm now in the process of adding FX lens to my kit.  Top of the line lens for it are expensive, but worth it for such a fine camera in my opinion.", "As of this morning, there are over 100 five star reviews that have deservably been given to the Nikon D800.  Each of these has given a fully detailed and described insight into some of the many technical specs of the Nikon D800 so I will save you from repeating it herewith.So, is the Nikon D800 worth the money.  Short answer?  YES.  It is a solid, well crafted, finely detailed piece of equipment. The minute you hold it, the second you look through the view finder, you will know that you are handling the utmost in photographic quality.In short, it is a solid piece of equipment that can handle any photography job - amature to professional - with a minimum of fuss.And the 36 megapixel output?  If you insist on seeing the immediate difference, shoot something indoors without the benefit of the built-in flash.  Even under low light conditions, the Nikon D800 delivers first rate quality shots with details emphasized that are breath taking.In short, if you are a professional, semi, or serious about picture taking then this is the camera for you.", "\"I rented the camera before I decided to buy the Canon 5D Mark III. This was primarily because I was too deeply invested into the Canon system having bought the original Canon 5D and multiple lenses.This is a camera that actually made me contemplate changing systems. Some of the reasons were exquisite sensor technology ( phenomenal shadow recovery, fantastic sharpness and detail), focus, metering and weather proofing. I like that Nikon put in the focus and metering system of their pro system. I felt like this was the second coming of the 5D.I do feel that the 5D Mark III has better ergonomics or at least what I have been used to as a canon user for 25 + years.Happy with the Mark III and feel that is a perfect compromise (canon does nickel and dime a lot) and one of the best handling camera that I have every used. But I will always suffer from \"\"what if\"\". These are good times to be a Nikon user.\"", "Let me first state that this camera will not make you a better photographer. Not even close. It may even make you a worse photographer. Why? because the hand shaking that was forgivable before will now be more evident at 100% zoom. Wait, why are you pixel peeping a 36MP camera? For pixel peepers, avoid this camera at all cost! I'll explain more below.The beauty of a high megapixel camera is that it makes your pictures better at the same megapixel size as your last camera! Let me explain this, for most lens, sharpness differences can be viewed at 100% zoom. Unless you print at gigantic 36MP, which only a very small percentage of pros will be using, it's moot. Now, when you downsize a picture, the pixels are interpolated. Lens that were previously unacceptable at 12MP all of a sudden look pretty decent at 12MP downsized from 36MP! For example, a picture that was taken with slight motion blur at 100% pixel peep will disappear when I re-size it to 12MP. That's the thing, most will not print a 36MP picture at 36MP! You will have to resize it to make prints! It's pretty insane to upload 36MP JPEGS to make 4x6 prints anyway. Although someday, I will hang a 36MP picture on my wall.So what's the purpose of getting a 36MP? First, high ISO noise will be interpolated out of existence when downsized. Second, blurriness will be sharpened out of existence when downsized. Third, your not so sharp lens at 100% will look pretty darn good downsized. You need to compare the pictures produced at the printed size and not at 100% zoom! If you take a picture of your face and zoom in at 100%, it'll be pretty unflattering with all the pores and stuff. Same concept here. So if you buy this camera just to view pictures at 100% zoom, you will all be disappointed because that simply is not the point.Coming from a D90, these are the things that are better.1. Full frame. Your 50mm prime now has a real 50mm FOV rather than a fake 75mm FOV.2. Bokeh. You get to see more of that 50mm FOV which means the bokeliciousness that were lost on the D90 is now there. The further you go away from the focus point, the softer the bokeh is. When the DX picture is truncated, you lose that bokeh. This is why full frame appears to have better bokeh.3. ISO. When downsized, my ISO 6400 looks like ISO 100 on a 12MP. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little...but not by much.4. Sharper image with the same lens. Yes, at 100% zoom, all the short-comings are there to see. At 12MP downsized, it will look very great.5. Cliff Mautner looking pictures. Yes, I went there. I've always looked at those nice midday pictures where Cliff take pictures of his models in front of a green background (trees) and the model's faces has that cool looking rim lights... yeah, I can replicate that! Except his models are better looking. Is this due to the better sensor or the better imaging processor?6. Better dynamic range. When the sun's beating down on you at high noon, dial the exposure compensation down -2EV, shoot without flash, and then fix the under exposed parts without blowing out highlights. Tada, natural light at high noon without flash! Very nice, Nikon!I have no green cast. I have no out of focus focus points (that I know of). My beep on focus function is broken. I turn it on, but it doesn't beep. I don't know why. At 100% zoom, my prime doesn't look that sharp at F1.8 as it does at F4. But I don't care. If you want a camera to test out lens sharpness, this camera is it! But don't blame me if you proceed to throw them all in the trash to buy sharper lens.Is this a better camera than the D700? It depends. Is it worth the $1300 premium for the added functionality? Is a $3000 Channel purse worth $1300 more than a $1800 LV purse? A purse doesn't even take pictures and you sure as heck can't downsize it on command! And yet my wife buys a new one each year. For me, yes it's worth it! I'm referring to the camera, not the purse. Then again, if you were reading carefully, I previously own a D90 not a D700.As a final note, I'm going to read more books on photography because this camera tells me what I'm terrible at it. I look at the pictures on Flickr that people took using this camera, then I compare it with my pictures, all I want to do is to punch myself in the face. If I become a better photographer as a result of owning this camera, then I guess the $3000 is worth it.This is the Internet. Feel free to tell me I'm idiot and that I'm wrong in the comments.Update 6/23/12: (1) The beep issue was resolved by deleting bank A and then use bank B. Unfortunately, my camera has the left focus issue. Most of my lens are fine, however I borrowed a friend's 24-70mm and the left most focus definitely has a problem on this one. In liveview, it works fine. I'm going to wait a few months to see what Nikon says about this before sending it in for repair.", "This is the most amazing piece of photographic equipment you'll ever add to your arsenal. I have a D7000 that I have absolutely loved, but honestly, the D800 really puts it all into perspective. It feels good in the hand. It performs amazing in low light. I look forward to a long, loving relationship with this little beauty. :)", "First a little history. I have been into SLR photography for more years than I can always remember. My first SLR was a Canon that I bought used in 1967. As soon as I could afford a Nikon, I bought a Nikkormat FTN...in 1972. I have shot Nikon SLR ever since.In 1999, I decided to be an early adopter and buy a digital camera. After a lot of soul searching, I bought a spiffy little model made by Fuji. From the first day of shooting with that camera, I was hooked. When my first Fuji died, I bought another one...but I soon grew tired of point-and-shoot digital. I wanted to get back to SLR shooting. In 2005, I bought a Nikon D70. Before I could even break it in, my daughter took a liking to it, so I gave it to her and bought a D80.By 2009, I was ready to move into serious digital photography. I bought a D300. I was so impressed with its capabilities; I bought another one so I had a backup in case anything failed. Well, nothing ever failed, and I was able to capture some great images with the two D300 bodies.In January of this year, I was able to get my hands on a Nikon D700 for a few weeks. That was my first full-frame DSLR. Fortunately, all of my lens except one was professional grade Nikon, and they all worked well with the D700. The image quality was superb and the low electronic noise allowed me to shoot under conditions I had avoided with my twin D300 bodies. During those few weeks, I decided full frame FX was my next move up in Nikon DSLR. However, I decided to wait until the rumored D800 became available.I pre-ordered a D800 the second day orders could be placed, and I received the camera at the end of April...just days before leaving for a photo trek to Arizona. With the help of D800 owners in the Nikonians user group and our trek leader who already had a D800, I was able to capture some great images in the AZ slot canyons. I shot single frames as well as high-dynamic range (HDR).When I got home and started to process the images, I was blown away by the details and sharpness of the images. I found that I had to upgrade several of my image software products to get them to take full advantage of the 36 MP images that came out of the D800.It has now been about six weeks since I received my D800. I have gone through a steep learning curve during that time. I have also started over several times with the menu and switch settings on both the camera and my Nikon lens. I have found that almost all of my lens work even better with the D800 than they did with any of my previous Nikon camera bodies. I did have to abandon a non-Nikon wide angle zoom that was designed for DX camera bodies. I also had to give up the use of Vibration Reduction (VR) use on my 200-400mm f4 lens; it simply would not work right.I now get greater details in images that are tack sharp with a wide dynamic range. I can print images at least 24 inches x 36 inches without using special printing software. I can also crop down to about 10 percent of an image of a bird or animal, and still get a nice image that I can print or put on the web.It took a lot of work to figure out how to get the best out of the D800, but in the end, it is worth every minute of that time.Update June 23, 2012:After a lot of testing, I have found that the VR issue with my 200-400mm lens is being caused by the lens...not the D800. The problem started at the same time I started to use the D800 but it was a coincidence.", "\"The ISO performance is not as good as the D4, but for studio work, this is the best camera you can buy right now.  Wish it had built-in wifi, wish the grip wasn't almost 500 bucks.  The size is unbelievably small for what it is, which makes it a great camera for \"\"walking around\"\" too.  When posed with the choice of which you should get - D4 or D800 - consider what you will use it for.  If you don't need 11 frames per second or to be able to take pictures in near-darkness, buy the D800.  If you find that you crop your photos a lot, get a D800.  Keep in mind that you will need to buy very large memory cards for this thing.  Spring for a set of 64GB cards right away.\"", "\"Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones but I can't find any issues with this new D800, as others have reported.  This actually delayed me from making the purchase after reading about problems.  It was after I spoke with someone with Nikon that I decided to buy one.  They acknowledged that some people reported a problem but it was not the norm.  Maybe more people are apt to write a review if they are angry about something rather than taking the time if everything is good.  Well in the case of the D800, \"\"Good\"\" is an understatement.  Breathtaking would be a better discription of what you can get with this camera.  I'm a pro photographer that moved up from the D700.  I thought the D700 was as good as it gets but WOW, you can't even compare the D700 with the D800.  It's that good!\"", "On paper this camera is a winner, 36MP, highest score in DXOMark. What could you ask more? Well the issue is, image quality and usability isn't a function of these attributes. I recommend to NOT buy a camera by specifications. Nokia's camera phone has 41MP, does any of you seriously want that?D800 is an improvement over D700 in these areas: AF in low light (locks slightly better), noise level at ISO above 6400 (this is arguably useful shooting in pitch darkness), better auto ISO by linking shutter speed, focal length and iso, lighter (very perceptible, 100g is a lot), Video (this is clearly missing from D700).However, for me the overall ability to crank out images at default settings hand held has actually gone down. The images lack a certain pop and sharpness. When using a tripod or flash (i.e. shutter speed is high), the images are sharper looking. However, the whole point of having a camera of this class is that you don't have to do that. It seems the Sony sensors Nikon uses (in D800 and D7000) suffer from a curious deficit in detail retention. The amount of MP is not translating into more details and quality. You have to work very hard and be lucky to see that. My D700 easily produces excellent images without much effort or post processing.", "I upgraded to this camera from D90.  This is my most expensive toy and I have never regretted.  I use it with Nikon 85/1.8 for portrait and Sigma 35/1.4 for other purposes.  Very happy with the combination."], "Gamma": [0.03375124931335449, 0.03375124931335449, 0.03375124931335449, 0.033730398863554, 0.033734772354364395, 0.03374404087662697, 0.03375124931335449,
