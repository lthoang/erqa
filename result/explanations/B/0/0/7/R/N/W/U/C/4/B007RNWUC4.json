It's very cool and alot of fun is to be had with this title...HOWEVERThere is one thing that really irks me with casual RPG players AKA generation Y and today's generation of gamers. An RPG is,was and forever shall be turned based... that's how RPGs started and what has become the game today that you so love. For different reasons 1.) the youth is plauged with ADHD and can only have their attention held long enough with lots of eye candy and ACTION ACTION ACTION!! and 2.) In America we have a pride to think that we can always do something better than any other country--- thus the \"\"western RPG\"\" was born,which is in fact nothing more than an action/shooter with a few mild RPG elements thrown in (leveling up,customization) Fallout and Borderlands do not constitute as an RPG.Also for those younger gamers who did not grow up with the 8-bit nintendo and whine about how much they would like \"\"JRPGS\"\" if you didn't have to keep fighting random battles; would you PLEASE take a moment to hear what you sound like? You're pretty much on the same page as saying \"\"I would really like the Madden games if you didn't have to pass the football so much.\"\" You are talking about a CORE element of the game. Obviously you DON'T like RPGS, so play one of the MANY other genres out there to suit your taste; action,shooter,platform,sports etc. Rather than forcing all the fans of real TURN BASED RPGS watch their favorite genre die off; at least allow for the so-called \"\"JRPG\"\" genre to exist as well as the \"\"Western RPG.\"\" Variety is the spice of life you know.Today we live in sad times where some truely amazing RPGs only get released on small,crappy hand held systmes IF they get released here at all. What I wouldn't give to have the entire Dragon Quest series available on PS3,360 or even the Wii (so long as motion gaming was not implemented) Or how about remakes of Mother 1,2 and 3? Or at least a Nintendo DSi player on the Wii so as to enjoy all these \"\"unpopular JRPGs\"\" on an HD big screen TV? Anyone? Anyone??\"", "Before I say anything, I just want to point out that you can pick this game up at GameStop for $50. Don't get suckered by these greedy sellers looking to pocket $60+ for a copy of a game that isn't even hard to find... The reason amazon isn't selling it directly is because this was a GameStop (and Nintendo) exclusive.With that said...This game is a blast! If only we didn't have to wait until practically the end of the Wii for something like this to come out. At least The Last Story is on it's way as well! Anyways...Gameplay:The game controls very easily if you are using a classic controller (I recommend it). The gameplay evolves a bit as you play, but there are more than enough simple, effective tutorials in place to keep you up to speed. Combat is very addictive. I found myself constantly fighting everything in sight, which unfortunately put me at too high of a level for most story content to be challenging. So, if you want more of a challenge, try not to kill everything too much.There are plenty of quests to undertake for those who love side quests and their rewards. For those who just want to dive into the story, completing these quests is not required. Oh, and I should mention that you can save your game anywhere/anytime you want!Story:I won't give any details away, but let me just say that this game handles suspense very well. If you are an RPG fan, you will walk away pleasantly surprised. There are a couple small anime cliches at work here, but the british voice talents leant to the game, as well as the impressive script/storyline are more than enough to make you forget about these things.Graphics:Don't believe people when they say this game has awful graphics. It's for the Wii, so it should be common knowledge that it isn't going to be an HD game. Sure, that doesn't mean it's on par with the 360/PS3, but the draw distance in this game is incredible, and the graphics are very impressive considering the Wii's hardware. Plus, load times consist of just a few seconds at most.Sound:As I mentioned earlier, the british voice talents in this game are excellent. Sound effects are nice and crisp and work well within the actions of the game. For the most part music is either pleasant or catchy. I only found a couple places in the game that honestly had annoying music.Overall:I can remember the day when JRPG's were king. Since then the market has obviously gone stale, with the same formula being reused over and over again. Xenoblade Chronicles doesn't completely change everything that wasn't selling, but let's just say it changes up 96% of it. The game isn't perfect, but if you are an avid RPG fan looking for something that can literally entertain you for hours and hours, then this game is for you.Here are a couple things I did not like about the game:-Inventory system is a little clunky, especially when you are comparing potentially new gear to already equipped gear. The difference in stats can literally require some math on your part since the game doesn't have a way of factoring in modifications you've made to existing gear vs. gear that might be better if you were to equip it and apply the same modifications...-Targetting system isn't as refined as it could have been. Some people might experience zero issues, but I know that occasionally when I moved to assist an ally being attacked the game would target enemies way off in the distance that aren't even involved in the battle. This all happens despite my would-be target standing right smack in the middle of the screen. For the most part, the targetting system works, but when you need it to work fast that's when it decides to target everything but what you need it to.", "i am soooo glad i reserved this game at gamestop. this game was offered as a pre-order and then just vanished off the face of the earth. this is probably going to be like panzer dragoon saga for the sega saturn where they only printed one shipment of 10,000 copies and that was it. i hope you people out there were smart enough to pick this one up as i feel it is already out of print after shipment #1 in the u.s. anyone, correct me if i'm wrong, but if you look at the price, it's already shot up to $100+ used!", "\"In general, I don't the Japanese RPG genre.  JRPG games tend to lose my interest in about 5 to 10 hours, but this game is one of those rare exceptions that has me craving more.Without spoiling much of the story, this game is about a hero with a special sword that lets him see into the future.  Naturally, he needs to save his people from a terrible threat and finds himself at the forefront of an epic war with his loyal companions by his side.  Admittedly, the set-up is a little generic, but the story and characters are well written and gain momentum throughout the game as things progress.  Combined with quality gameplay and a long story with tons of side-quests, there is a lot to look for in this game.GAMELENGTH: So far, I'm only 20 hours into the game and it feels like the main story is just picking up.  I've been doing a lot of side-quests and it seems that most of the estimates on the internet are very accurate when they say the game will take between 60 and 70 hours to beat.  There are literally hundreds of quests to complete in the game.  The world is massive.  I easily spent 12 hours in the first area of the game alone.  You can pretty much go anywhere you want, but you will quickly find yourself in some areas where the monsters are way too powerful if you start getting a little too curious and wander too far astray.GAMEPLAY: The combat and many other gameplay mechanics are probably most similar to some of the massively multi-player games out there like World of Warcraft.  Although there is a primary story arc you can find side-quests all over by talking to random people and characters you meet throughout the game.  Quests range from item collection fetch quests, delivery quests, kill X number of creature quests, and challenge quests where you are expected to slay a unique and power special monsters.  There are a lot of NPCs to talk to and keep track of, in true JRPG fashion.  Luckily, the vast majority of the side-quests and NPCs are not necessarily important, but they can be a lot of fun to talk to them, trade with them, and complete their quests.COMBAT is a nice blend of automatic attacking mixed with special abilities that have cool-down timers.  Although the game is single-player only and you only directly control one character at a time you still have a party of other characters to back you up.  You can switch between characters as the primary character and the others operate on auto-pilot.  Don't let that fool you though, because the game doesn't just play itself.  Combat can get very hectic very fast and requires that you keep a close eye on your character, your abilities and your allies.  There is also a mechanic that allows you to do linked chain attacks using special abilities of each of the party members.  So far my experience is that it can be rather difficult to build up the Party Meter that allows you to use these attacks, but when you can pull them off, they are devastating.  Additionally, the combat gameplay actually incorporates the main character's ability to see into the future, periodically showing you what is about ready to happen to the party and thus giving you a chance to change the future.  It is definitely a neat twist on combat and it is handled rather well.INVENTORY AND CRAFTING: Like most RPGs, this game has a lot of inventory management.  Some people (like my crazy roommate) love managing and tweaking inventory, some people hate it.  I lean towards hating it in this game in the same way I hate it in most RPGs, but this game does it pretty well compared to most.  You will get a lot of loot and periodically you will have to just spend some time sorting and selling the junk you don't want.  You get lots of storage so you can go quite a long time without having to do an inventory cleanup which is very good in my opinion.  The game also incorporates a gem crafting mini-game that allows you to create mods for you gear.  The crafting mini-game is decent and I'm sure it has its uses for people that want that extra edge on their enemies, but so far I'm doing pretty well without doing much crafting.GRAPHICS: This game is a mixed bag graphically.  The character models are nicely done but are very low resolution.  Animations are often repetitive and characters and monsters often fade into existence visibly out of thin air as you approach.  In that respect, the game is pretty average by today's standards.  The game excels by providing gorgeous and massive environments with rich colors and interesting architecture with brilliant artistic style and flavor.  As a current generation game, the game suffices in the graphics department. As a Wii game, the game is one of the absolute best looking titles on the system.SOUND: The music in this game is great but as with anything you listen to for 60+ hours, it will eventually get a little repetitive.  There is a reasonable amount of voice acting in the game and what is done is done well, although the animations and voice acting tend to be off more often than not.  Since the game has not been localized to the United States the voice acting is done by European actors instead so you will notice some accents.  I personally like it because it gives a bit of cultural flavor to the experience.STORY: Like I said before, the story is long and engaging.  It does have a few annoying elements to the story that seem to plague all video game stories, but overall I have to say this is definitely one of the better stories I've seen in a game.CONTROLS: The controls are pretty smooth.  They aren't amazing but they aren't bad either and they definitely get the job done.  I never feel like I am fighting the controls and they allow me to focus on the game.  Since this game supports using the classic controller I haven't even tried using the Wii Remote at all.  I can say the classic controller works great for this game.  The camera controls are a little slow, but they really have no effect on my enjoyment of the game.PROS+++ Long and engaging story+++ Literally hundreds of quests+++ Quality voice acting+++ Great music (but you get to listen to it for 60 hours)+++ Amazing environments+++ Deep and involved inventory customization+++ Deep and involved combatCONS--- The under-powered Wii shows its limitations and you can often see how the programmers had to \"\"cheat\"\" with the graphics to make sure the game runs smoothly.--- Tracking down where you need to go for sub-quests can be really hit and miss and can leave you wandering.  Luckily the main quest-line goals are very clear.--- Inventory management may be a little tedious for some folks--- Combat can get very hectic and overwhelming at times--- Some bosses are brutally lethal and you may have to fight the same boss many times before progressing.All in all, I have to say this is an absolutely enjoyable game, and as a Wii game it is simply amazing.  The blend of classic RPG action mixed with real-time combat and party based mechanics has me hooked.  I typically don't like most modern RPGs except Fallout or Mass Effect, but I am definitely enjoying this game more than anything else I've played on the Wii for over a year.  If you are looking for a great RPG experience, pick this game up immediately.  The limited release in America is probably going to make this game very expensive very quickly, but I could be wrong.========NOTE: As stated by other users, this game is available through Game Stop at normal retail price for new release games.  At the time of this writing, most of the Amazon sellers offering this game are trying to mark the game up way more than they should be, double in some cases.  Of course, if you don't have a GameStop in your area, Amazon is definitely a good place to consider buying.========\"", "Loved this game, spent 110 hours on my first play through with most of the side quests completed.  Haven't had this much fun with this genre since the Final Fantasy series on PS2, can't wait to see what Monolith comes up with next.", "XENOBLADE: CHRONICLES (aka: MONADO: BEGINING OF THE WORLD) is one of those great games that (for some unfathomable reason) Nintendo had initially decided not to market outside Japan. It has been available, fully translated, since August in Europe (where my copy came from). This used not to be true for the US. Luckily, Nintendo North America (at last!) yielded to the pressure of the fans and announced the release of the game.THE MUSIC WILL ENCHANT YOUR SOULThis is the first thing that hits your senses. The music of Xenoblade reminded me of playing Final Fantasy VII years ago and being mesmerized by its music. The Prelude I can still remember. In Xenoblade, the music will range from atmospheric to epic rock, and all the shades and colors in between.It will be a familiar companion while you travel and a strengthening presence when you do battle, greatly enhancing the overall experience. Every map has its own theme (most with day and night variations) and you will catch yourself humming them long after having turned your console off.Sometimes the importance of the music in a game is underestimated and the focus remains on the graphics. Xenoblade is a perfect example of how essential music is in order to achieve a total immersive gaming experience.LIVE AND BREATH IN A GORGEOUS ANIME WORLDNow, all of us who decided to go with the Nintendo Wii, we knew that it was not the most graphically powerful console. Its strengths lie elsewhere. Having said that, Xenoblade is the most beautiful and graphically detailed game on the Wii. Ever.Set on two ancient biomechanical Titans frozen in mid-battle centuries ago, the world is simply enormous. There are about 20 maps, almost every map is huge and it is all open to exploration. Because there are only few and short loading times, you are practically flowing from one into the next as in a continuous world. And exploring the endless and open Xenoblade world is not only fun to do but also very rewarding.The grass moves around your feet, birds sweep over your head, clouds roll by day, the galaxy scintillates at night and the whole world comes alive around you. In the heat of the battle the hits and special moves will be accompanied by impressive anime graphical events. Up close the characters may not be that detailed but the characters, their weapons and the environments have all been designed with great artistry. When the limitations of the Wii are reached you probably will not notice it either. Xenoblade has far better graphics than all the other notable Wii JRPG, such as The Legend of Zelda, Okami or Rune Factory: Frontier. My Wii had never produced such a visually advanced game!THE STORY DRAWS YOU IN AND NEVER LETS GOAs any seasoned RPGer would tell you, the story is equally important to the graphics and the music, if not more so. And Xenoblade excels in this aspect as well. A tad clich&eacute;d at times, the story advances with beautifully made cinematic sequences and it manages to feel both reassuringly familiar and surprisingly fresh.The human colonists (the Homs) are living on one of the frozen titans, Bionis, and are attacked by mechanical life-forms (the Mechons) who occupy the other. So, after the initial battle, it is up to Shulk, your hero, the young survivor from Colony 6 and the new bearer of Monado, together with (up to 3 of) his companions to save their world.You bond with your companions by the choices you make - and this affects their abilities. Your choices also affect both the conversation options with Non-Playing Characters (NPCs) and the quests becoming available to you. In fact, everyone and their sister seems to have a quest for you. Conveniently, you do not have to go back to them once completed.Xenoblade will enchant you with its sound vistas and ensnare you with its story.WIELD THE BLADE THAT SEES INTO THE FUTUREAs with any true RPG, there is leveling up, looting, crafting, bartering and re-equipping your character as well as his companions. Interestingly, the custom appearance you chose for them will not be lost during the cinematic scenes. If you enjoy earning achievements, Xenoblade has you covered. The game allows you to save almost anywhere but it also autosaves at nicely spaced Landmarks - and dying will only take you back to the last one encountered (without any XP or loot penalties).The battle system is real-time but both the distance to their enemy and your relative position are factored in (hint: for such an oversized sword, backstabbing strangely pays off). Monado has powers that are unleashed after building up normal attacks. The legendary sword also allows you to glimpse into the future in order to avert enemy blows. Moreover, your hero and his companions have special abilities, called Arts (that need to recharge before they can be reused).The enemies, especially the bosses, will focus on the character inflicting the most damage to it - and this allows for flanking maneuvers by the rest of your party. Most battles are not that hard however some of the bosses will tax your understanding of the game mechanics.Equally important is that is not a one-ride-pony. Once the game is completed you can restart the entire story with your high level character to complete and explore everything you missed the previous time around.Xenoblade-Chronicles gives you the option to experience it either dubbed in (in the UK version, British accented and not lip-synched) English or in (partially) subtitled original Japanese. After I had clocked in about half a dozen hours in the game I decided to restart it and opted to keep the original Japanese instead. After all, this is a JRPG and it feels much more authentic.A classic masterpiece, not to be missed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "\"One of the main reasons that I love gaming as much as I do is because of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games).  The first RPG I ever played, the NES JRPG Dragon Warrior, got me hopelessly hooked on the genre as a whole.  My favorite game of all time, Final Fantasy IV, is another JRPG, and was the first game that showed me that video games could reach a level of emotion and compelling storytelling that was as deep and as powerful as any great novel or film.  And since then, many of my favorite games throughout my gaming lifetime have been JRPGs.  However, during this console generation, the balance of power in creating great RPGs has shifted westward.  While Western developers have been releasing masterpieces such as Fallout 3, the Mass Effect series, the Witcher series, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, JRPGs have fallen behind the curve.  The great Final Fantasy series has released games that have polarized gamers, and the few innovative JRPGs that have been released have been seemingly relegated to handheld devices while Western RPG hybrids have dominated the console landscape.  However, the North American release of Xenoblade Chronicles demonstrates that not only are JRPGs still vibrant and brilliant, but that they can still be innovative and forward-thinking, and that the future for this genre is bright.There is really nothing bad that I can say about Xenoblade Chronicles.  This is a huge, epic, sweeping game that brings a sense of adventure to the gamer that few other games can match.  Starting with the basics, the combat system is close to perfect.  If you've played Final Fantasy XII, that is the closest comparison I can make, except that Xenoblade's combat feels more alive and interactive, and much less automated than Final Fantasy XII's.  While your AI party members control themselves, your placement on the battleground and the abilities you choose to bring into battle for both yourself, and those you equip for your party, will have a huge impact on your effectiveness in battle.  While it may appear daunting at first, you'll find, like with all of Xenoblade's interfaces and systems, that the combat is actually very easy to use and master.  Your characters can be strengthened by a deep set of game mechanics involving traditional leveling up via XP (experience points), the leveling up of Arts (abilities in battle), skills (passive abilities) and the crafting of gems (enhancements).  The way everything ties together is absolutely wonderful and seemingly limitless in the ways you can customize your party.  New weapons and equipment can be obtained though defeating enemies, completing side quests, and by purchasing them at shops.  And with every piece of armor and every weapon containing a distinct appearance, you'll love the way your character and party members' looks change throughout the game.Another thing that really impressed me about Xenoblade is the way it bucks so many of the negative stereotypes that plague many JRPGs.  While the story may appear to be somewhat conventional in the beginning, you'll quickly realize that this is not only one of the best stories ever told in a JRPG, but it is written in a mature, emotive and concise way (huge kudos to the team that did the English translation) that is delivered by a wonderful group of British voice actors.  The characters for the most part are really great, and hold none of the \"\"emo\"\" stereotypes so many Western gamers associate with games in this genre.  This is an absolutely amazing tale that anyone will be able to get into, and although it takes a few slight turns into the convoluted near the end, it concludes on a powerful note that will leave a lasting impression.This is a huge game that can take you well over 100 hours if you're a completionist.  I personally spent about 85 hours with the game, and completed about half of the more than 500 side quests.  While the side quests are a great way to earn money, items, and sometimes XP, with them being MMO-ish in nature, they can become somewhat repetitive after a certain amount of time spent doing them.  But the good thing is that they are absolutely non-essential to progressing through the game, and the developers have graciously made it so that you can complete side quests without always having to return to the person who gave them to you (a HUGE time saver that was definitely appreciated by this gamer).  As you get to the later areas in the game, you'll find that the side quests will open up new areas of the map, and expose you to enemies that are even tougher than the final boss.  However, you'll most likely find that you'll end up completing a good amount of these side quests without even purposely doing so, as Xenoblade presents a world that is so incredible, compelling and mysterious, that you'll want to explore every inch of it.The world of Xenoblade exists on the bodies of two primordial titans, who were frozen in time while battling each other to the death.  This creates a fantastical game world that is a feast for the eyes.  Some of the best art design of any game you'll ever see is to be found here, pushing the Wii's hardware to the absolute limit of its capabilities.  This is all supplemented by a masterful musical score created by some of the most brilliant, long-standing composers in the business, including Yoko Shimomura and Yasunori Mitsuda.  You will remember this beautiful music for a very, very long time after you finish the game.Xenoblade Chronicles is the complete package.  It is one of the grandest adventures ever to appear in the medium of a video game.  It is one of this generation's greatest games.  It's easily the best JRPG of this generation, the JRPG I've enjoyed the most since the wonderful Dragon Quest VIII on the PS2, and a genuine surprise for the aging Nintendo Wii, a console that many gamers have written off as of this writing in mid 2012.  In short, it is a genuine masterpiece.  But most importantly, it will hopefully be a strong example for game developers in Japan who are developing JRPGs.  Xenoblade shows that not only is the Japanese role playing game still extremely relevant and vibrant, but that it also can have a very bright future.  Xenoblade contains everything that has made this genre so great for the last 25 years while still looking forward and blazing new trails in the road ahead.  If you were like me, and were starting to get a bit pessimistic about the genre, this game will rejuvenate and excite you.  If you've never played a JRPG before and are wondering what it's all about, there is no better place to start than here.  A huge thanks to Monolift Soft for making this wonderful, important game, to Operation Rainfall and the many others who pushed for its release here, and to Nintendo of America for finally bringing it to our shores.  Don't miss out on this one!!\"", "I have to begin with some information about the release of this game. This game was originally released in Japan on June 10th, 2010. It took a lot of effort to finally get this game released in the USA. Credit goes to a few sources such as Operation Rainfall to help rally support, Gamestop for help funding the release (more on that later), and Nintendo of America for finally publishing this game for North America. I purchased this from Gamestop as it was the only retailer selling this game besides purchasing directly from Nintendo. The manager informed me that Gamestop made a deal with Nintendo to purchase all the copies of this game, essentially funding the North American localization and giving Gamestop exclusive rights to sell the game. Long story short, yes you have to purchase from Gamestop but that shouldn't stop anyone as it will help support these types of games for future releases in the USA. I would recommend playing this game with the Classic Controller or Classic Pro. The Wii remotes and Nunchuk aren't really complicated but it is much easier to move around and attack during combat with the other controllers and you don't have to hold two controllers.This game is a JRPG (Japanese Roll-Playing game) from director Tetsuya Takahashi (worked on a lot of the Final Fantasy games, Chrono Trigger, and Xenogears Saga). The story is amazing and will keep you hooked. The gameplay is addictive. There is a reason why game informer magazine gave this game a 9.5 out of 10, metacrtic a 92% and several other reviewers gave it a 9 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10. When you play it, you will see why.Battle System: Uses a real-time battle system with positioning. Similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic, you select enemies (the main enemy is robots called Mechons or you can attack local wildlife), and choose to attack them. Some enemies will attack you on sight or sound. You can sneak up on most enemies and do a back attack for major damage. What is similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic is that when you choose to attack, your party automatically attacks. The difference from those games is that the player you are controlling, you have to move them into position for them to auto-attack. Everybody has special attacks called arts and talent arts. These are spell-like abilities such as healing, shielding, defense, etc. and special attacks that can knock enemies down. Each art has a recharge period before you can use it again and talent arts recharge by using enough regular attacks. Some special art attacks will depend on positioning of the enemy, such as back attack you need to be behind the enemy or a side attack you need to be on one of the enemy's sides to deal the maximum damage. Other aspects of battle include combo attacks and the ability of your main weapon (the Xenoblade) to see future enemy attacks that will essentially knock out a party member. This ability gives you a chance to stop it from happening by warning that party member or doing something else to prevent it. The battle system is somewhat complex but very manageable with tutorials and they don't throw all aspects at you from the beginning. You can lock-on to enemies before actually attacking them and see what level they are at and if they will attack on site, sound, or just leave you alone. Obviously if you see an enemy or animal at level 75 when you are at level 20 you will know not to mess with them, but keep your distance as they may attack on sight and wipe you out fast.Inventory/Leveling up: Inventory is massive and found all over the place and obtained in treasure chests from defeated enemies. You can see if each item will help raise or lower the stats of each player. Some clothing items have slots on them where you can add ability gems or some come with ability gems already attached to them. More about this in the next section. You can buy and sell inventory. Leveling up is done automatically when you gain a level. Each combat art must be manually leveled up. From each battle, you gain points to use for leveling up these abilities.Gems: This is somewhat complicated to explain. There are multiple types of gems you can create including gems for increasing stats, attacks, defense, etc. You have to craft these gems from the raw materials you gather. Each material has one or multiple stat enhancements attached to them. These stats are measured in a percentage. When crafting gems, you have to choose a combination of materials that will take one of those stats to 100% or higher in order to create a gem. If there are multiple stat enhancements that don't reach 100% during crafting, you will be able to save 1 or more of them in pure form and reuse them. Materials also have different levels so you can craft higher level gems as you progress. All of this might sound confusing and granted I am still experimenting with this, but it is easier to do than to explain and the tutorials do a great job of explaining this.World Map/Exploration: Each area you explore has a map. Different points you come across in each area will have an auto transport icon that lets you warp to that location. If you want to go back to Colony 9 (where the game starts), you can just warp and then warp back to where you were). Exploration is very open and the area to explore is huge. The director described the area as the size of the Japanese Archipelago (basically the size of Japan itself) but the game moves along nicely. Each new area you reach on the map will also net you some experience points so exploring is beneficial to leveling up. There is day and night time during the game and enemies are different during the day and night. You can change the time of day at any time which is a nice feature and you can save anywhere (except during battles).Missions/Side Quests: The main story missions are easy to find and follow. A lot of times you get an arrow pointing the direction and distance you need to go. Side quests are plenty in this game. Most of them are not complicated just collecting certain items or defeating certain creatures. When you collect an item that is used for a future side quest or mission, the Manado tells you and marks that item for you so you know not to sell it. Side quests net you experience and money.Conclusion: This game is simply amazing. This is the first game I have ever reviewed before I actually complete it. I am about 20 hours in and loving every minute of this. I want to get the word out to pick this up and support this game. If you are a fan of JRPGs (and who isn't), get this game. If you are new to JRPGs, get this game. I believe this game will have aspects that every gamer will enjoy. Story, battle, exploration, crafting, character development, etc. This game has it all. Can't wait to finish it. If this game sounds complex, just remember that there are tutorials along the way and you can review them at any time during the game. I will update this review with any other details that I come across that could help other gamers make their decision to purchase. If you have questions, feel free to ask and I will try and answer them quickly. I give this game a 10 out of 10 and I don't see that changing as I progress in the game. This is the best graphics I have seen on the Wii and although it is not HD, I'm just glad I get to play this game and I thank all the efforts that went into getting Nintendo to release this in North America."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07645150274038315, 0.018183831125497818, 0.23361240327358246, 0.08940155059099197, 0.15236596763134003, 0.02362903207540512, 0.08879883587360382, 0.31755685806274414]]}
