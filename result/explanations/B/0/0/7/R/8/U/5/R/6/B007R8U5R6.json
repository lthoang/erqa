I only wish the would have included DLNA video.  There are tons of features that this unit has and they have been covered thoroughly by the other reviewers.  Pretty awesome unit.", "This is one awesome receiver.  I'd bought it to replace an older receiver and an old HDMI switcher and I'm so glad that I had.  This receiver has lots of headroom for dramatic music/audio tracks on shows.  The setup was a snap, while there is lots of stuff to tweak if you'd like.  Also, it will remember if you had the dvd or bluray on last and keep the latest input  when it turns on, instead of always reverting to the stereo when powered on.  The automatic Audyssey MultEQ sets up the speakers for optimal sound quality as well as checking for reverse polarity on connections.  The surround capabilities that I got was incredible compared to what I had been missing but didn't know.  My only beef/con was that the huge/capable remote was not backlit.  But I didn't think that was enough for one star deduction for such a great receiver.  I do recommend a nice set of banana plugs for speaker connection. I'd forgotten to mention that all the tweaking is done from the comfort of the couch because of the onscreen display ability while setting things up, and if you don't want anyone accidently changing the settings there is a very simple onscreen lock for the setup screen that doesn't need a password or something to forget.", "This receiver has replaced myOnkyo TX-SR607 7.2-Channel A/V Surround Home Theater Receiver (Black)and it is a step up for several reasons.Setup was quick and easy.  Granted, I already had my speaker cables terminated with [[ASIN: B005BT2KJE Banana Plugs]] so between that and everything being HDMI the cutover took about two minutes.  Stepping through the assisted setup to identify what was where took a few minutes more and running the Audyssey automated speaker setup took 10 minutes more and then I was good to go.  A little while later I plugged an Ethernet cable in, entered my credentials, and had Pandora Internet Radio.How does it sound, you ask?  It turns out some people have the ability to accurately remember subtleties when hearing sounds and can accurately compare them.  I'm not one of those people.  However, while I can't enumerate the differences in sound quality between my old system and this one, even to my untrained ear it sounds lots better.", "\"This is my first Denon and boy, am I happy with this unit! It replaces an olderOnkyo TX-SR606 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)that was my audio workhorse for the last 4 years. Because of its network capabilities, it does so much more than just provide a central hub for all your audio equipment. The first thing you'll want to do is update the firmware. Connect the Denon to your TV with an HDMI cable so you see what's going on. Then connect a network cable to the back to the unit. It takes about 30 minutes to finish, so go take a shower or talk to your cat until then.The onscreen interface is fairly bland, but it's straightforward and will take you through all the setup, like network settings, speaker configuration, etc. A QSG (Quickstart Guide) is included, but a printed manual is not. It's on a CD or can be downloaded from Denon's website. I'm not one of those people that misses printed manuals. I appreciate having them in electronic format since they don't take up space. The manual is very detailed and comprehensive, totaling 150+ pages. You won't need it if you've set up an AVR before, however. All the ports are clearly labeled and probably the only thing you'll need to refer to is the Audyssey calibration setup and listening positions so you can get the best performance out of your speakers, as each user's room configuration is unique. The Audyssey calibration unit also works with the Onkyo and other AVR's. I do wish the terminal screws were color-coded though, but this is no big deal. My Onkyo, for example, has a different color for each speaker terminal, to match the wires so I don't have to keep looking back and forth to identify what's what.There are 5 HDMI inputs, which ought to be enough for almost everybody. I have a PS3, XBOX360, Blu-ray player,Western Digital WD TV Live Media Player, and cable, which fills out the full complement of ports. Need more that that and you can buy an HDMI Switcher, 3to1 Switch. The front has an additional 6th HDMI port, and there are a multitude of additional legacy analog ports as well as one optical port. The Denon connects to SiriusXM, Pandora, and Spotify if you have an account with these services. Strangely, there's also a Flickr browser that lets you look at photographs. None of these interest me (Pandora I stopped using due to the lack of variety, and the others, I don't want to pay for) and I wish that blip.fm was also included in the mix. You can also listen to FM and numerous internet radio stations. There are, without exaggeration, over a thousand stations divided into dozens upon dozens of genres and sub-genres. Some of them may not always be reachable because they are being streamed from all over the world or due to network problems. I tried listening to some stations from China, HK, Germany, Japan, and Denmark as a random test. Most of the ones from China didn't load, but quality is quite good for all the ones that did. It's not just music. There are news stations, sports, weather, religion, podcasts.. a whole random assortment of stuff. This is great for users looking to expand their horizons a bit and are wildly diverse. You can bookmark stations for later.The feature that I am really pleased with, however, is AirPlay compatibility and ability to control the Denon via my smartphone. You can stream music directly from your iPhone or iPod touch straight to the Denon (I'm on a 4S). No need for a USB cable. Listening to someGoldfrappfor the first time through the Denon, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. The sound is fantastic coming out of the speakers. I've never heard my music sound this good before, hearing nuances and sounds I never did through my headphones.The best part is that you can control the Denon from another room through the DENON Remote App (search for \"\"Denon app\"\" in App Store). You don't need to point the iPhone at the AVR. As long as your phone is within range of your WiFi network, you'll be able to communicate with the Denon. I love the freedom this allows me. My iPhone has steadily taken over my life, becoming the central hub for entertainment, work, communications, and organizing my life in general. With AirPlay, I don't need to tie up my phone being a jukebox or fumble with the included remote. While well-designed and not a mishmash of buttons, nothing beats the intuitiveness of a touchscreen display and the laziness of surfing from a bed or sofa in the next room. The app is much more convenient than the included remote, particularly when looking for internet radio. Say, if I'm listening to music in bed and it's dark. For one thing, you don't need to have the TV on to see the menu or look at the AVR's LED display! It's right in the palm of your hands. AirPlay would also be very handy for parties. Guests don't even need to download the app and there's no complicated setup or Bluetooth pairing like I had to do with some cars I've ridden in. Just give your guests your WiFi password and the AirPlay compatible device should just appear as an output option.I can't think of anything bad to say about this Denon. The only thing I don't like is the door flap for the front inputs. Push it on the right side and it pops out, exposing jacks for HDMI, USB, RCA plugs, and the Setup Mic. It is not a captive/spring-loaded door, so it could potentially get lost quite easily. Again, not a big deal since I'll never use these ports.All in all, I love this AVR, with AirPlay and smartphone remote (available for Android as well) being the best features. It sometimes crashes, but I'm willing to tolerate it for now. If you don't need all the controls (for internet radio, zones), you can just use the default Music player on iPhone and just play your playlist through the Denon via AirPlay. Pushing AirPlay will turn the Denon on automatically. You do have to manually turn it off though.. or wait til the auto Power-Off timer kicks in.UPDATE: Aug 26, 2013 - After testing several other AVR's, this Denon remains my favorite because of AirPlay and the exceptional app (by comparison). Denon has improved the stability of the app and I don't remember it crashing any more. For its price, this Denon is an excellent value. The only thing missing is WiFi, if that's important to you. For me, it would be great to eliminate 1 more wire going around my apartment, but it's not a big deal.\"", "The problems begin when attaching the speakers. The connectors are too close together for easy access, not to mention the type of connectors used. The screw in connectors are bulky for such confined space which limits attaching and verifying the connection. The next problem is the sub-woofer, all the speaker inputs are +/- speaker wire and the sub-woofer is an AV jack. As the unit does not come with speakers it should be more standardized, most speakers come with all the same connections. You're going to have to buy an adapter which means you're going to have sound loss.Moving on to the component connections, the designers think that they're helping by pre-labeling the connection groupings but unless you're going to offer all the most popular connection types for each connection group then you're setting the user up for failure. With the DirecTV HD tuner, Blu-ray and Wii we have connected the labeling only works for the Blu-ray. This may not seem like a big deal, but when you're trying to set this up for a family situation you have to make it usable for the most un-tech savvy of the group. Something as simple as mislabeling a component can lead to major headaches when it is used solo without the IT guy. Lucky for me and most others there is a wonderful invention known as a Logitech Harmony remote that does the start up in a macro and has a help button.Now when you have everything attached, it's a little more easy flowing. The only drawback is trying to find the microphone input. It took me a minute or two to get the cover off and back on. Hooking up the mic and going through the wizard to verify setup and configure your speakers for the room's acoustics is an annoying process as it has to do a really loud pinging, a process that may have to be repeated multiple times if there is the problem with the setup. Send out the un-tech savvy out of the room as this will annoy them to no end. When they express their annoyance it nullifies the test (must be done without background noise) and it has to be redone.With everything setup and ready to use, the system really shines. The sound quality is great and the unit adapts to the different type of inputs automatically. Now you just have to make minor adjustments to taste. Compared to all-in-one units I've used in the past, it is noticeably a step above. If you can survive the setup, this unit is worth it but it is a giant hurdle.", "I am not a big AV person but still want to have good sound while watching movies, tv or listening to music.  The Denon is a nice device that offers a lot of features that I find useful.  Outside of the connection to the TV I like having ability to listen to internet radio and play my ipod through the unit.  I did hook the unit up to my TV with and HDMI cable but had mixed results.  A number of times after turning on the TV (Sharp Aquos) and the Denon the video from my DirectTV box would not show on the TV.  This could be because of my TV but it is an item to note as it became an issue when family was trying to watch TV while I was not around.  Outside of this issue I have not had any others with the unit itself.  I tend to listen to the internet radio the most as there are a few channels that are good for the music (Metal) that I listen to.  One thing that is very nice is the iOS applications for Iphone and Ipad.  It seems to be that Denon limited the functionality on the unit itself and put most of the controls onto the apps or through the interface that you can navigate via your TV.  It is nice to have but sometimes it seems like the unit is now to dependent on either navigating through the TV or through a mobile device.  The iOS device is nice and works well and lets me control turning the unit on and off as well as all the features such as internet radio, regular radio, blue ray, iPod, just to name a few.  There are a few quirks when using the iOS application, such as when your phone goes to a lock screen.  When this happens and you go back to control the Denon often the connection has been lost.  When the connection is re-established it doesn't always work correctly so I have to reopen the application.  One thing to keep in mind is that this only has a ethernet jack and does not have wireless.  So if you want to connect to your home network and it is not located next to your router you will need to either run a cable or purchase an ethernet over power lines adaptor set.Outside of the few issues I have had, the unit is nice and I would recommend it for the casual AV person.  It provides plenty of features to connect all the devices you have and the applications are nice additions to allow better control of the unit.  I just wish that more could be controlled through the unit itself without having to have the TV on to navigate through the options.", "I decided to save $150 bucks abd buy a used one (in new condition) on Amazon. Sure enough it was in very good conditions, with full bubble-wrap, card board insetrs and all manuals. It looked just like new and works perfectly. Keep in mind that this is not a wireless system so you need to direct connect an RJ45 cable from your router to make it work. I decided to buy a pair of powerlines for 35 dollars that did the trick. Now I can use Airplay which is fantastic and listen to Cirrus, radio stations and several other internet based music stations. All my wife has to do is start jogging on the treadmil and start playing one of her workout songs, and it automatically turns on the reciever and plays. She controls the volume and everything - Great.", "The AVR-1913 allows you to enjoy not only the powerful surround sound of the latest 3D videos in a 7.1-channel home theater but also a variety of advanced network functions such as listening to thousands of free Internet radio stations or playing music files stored on a PC.

I would buy this product again and again.  Sound and upscaling is just awesome.", "This is my first entrance into true high definition stereos.  For years I've purchased and enjoy the all-in-one stereo, blu-ray, speaker packages from Sony.  I've had 3 in the past 8 years and have been happy with them all.  But now I've taken the plunge into true home theater by creating a component based system.  I figure that investing in a component system will save me more money in the long run and give me better sound and video.  Instead of upgrading my entire system every few years, I can upgrade only the parts that are outdated - which is basically the video player.This Denon receiver has everything that I could want in a receiver, including SiriusXM radio and even Pandora. Using the front facing iPod jack is much better than using a rear input.  I can swamp iPhones to access playlists on my friends' phones.  I like the clean and hi-end look of the unit.  The remote is pretty basic.  Upgrading to a digital touchscreen remote may come down the road.The clarity of sound that this receiver puts out is superb.  I'm (slowly) building a collection of Klipsch Reference series speakers to place around my living room.  The sound from this combination is unreal.  No distortion at high volume, perfect pitch and deep room shaking bass.  Be sure to invest in a good set of speakers if you want to get the most from this Denon receiver.The menu system is intuitively and easy to use.  Not much else to say here except that I haven't yet explored all of the features that this system offers, such as PC streaming and multiple room audio.  But I will update my review when I do.I'm very happy with my purchase and look forward to building my dream system.", "I bought this to replace an older receiver.  Connections and setup was straight-forward and easy.  Banana plugs for the speaker wires and HDMI for my TV, DVD player, and XBOX 360. The setup assistant stepped me thru the basic process.  The speaker calibration process resulted in a good set up for my speakers, although I boosted the subwoofer level a little.The set up GUI uses HDMI and displays on the TV which is absolutely great.  No need to peer at the receiver display to see where you are.I set up the receiver with a 5.1 configuration (Polk Audio speakers) although it is nice to know I can expand out to 7.1 by hooking up two more speakers and going back thru the speaker calibration step.The HDMI video pass thru works fine and the up-conversion to 1080P is great.  The analogue channels on my cable service (COX) now look a lot better.There is plenty of power with the audio.  The sound is great regardless of source.Although not a universal remote, the receiver remote is very intuitive and easy to use.  I use my cable universal remote for basic operation (power, volume, mute, etc.) and the receiver remote for setup mods and source switching (TV, XBOX, etc.).No owner's manual booklet was provided (a first for me) but a PDF file is available on the supplied DVD.  I copied this to my laptop and browsed thru it with no problem.  I expect to be able to easily use it that way.The only complaint I have is that there is no wireless internet connection, only Ethernet.  Unless your home network router is next to the receiver or nearby, this presents a real problem for internet connectivity.  I just happened to have a relatively old Linksys Ethernet to wireless N gaming adapter. Once I synced the adapter with my router, the network setup on the receiver went smoothly and I was able to access the internet.  I did a firmware update, then accessed internet radio which also sounds great.  The adapter I used isn't sold anymore, but there are a number of Ethernet to wireless N adapters and bridges out there.  For example, the Linksys WET610N dual band Ethernet to wireless N adapter is available on Amazon.com for about $40.  This is the reason I rated the receiver with a 4 vs. a 5.Update 11/7:I recently upgraded my home theatre setup with the addition of a LG 55LM7600 Smart 3D LED TV, and a Sony BDPS590 Smart 3D Bluray player on the video side and upgraded speakers (Definitive Tech ProCenter 1000 Center, Polk Audio T15 Front speakers, and Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer) with expansion from 5.1 to 7.1 audio.  A simple recalibration of the speakers took care of the audio.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on the Bluray player (WOW)to make sure the 3D passthru was working.  My TV also has 3D simulation from 2D sources which I have used a number of times.  All this was done successfully with ease with the AVR1913 as the hub of the system.", "The Denon AVR-1913 INTEGRATED NETWORK AV RECEIVER has many features, with six HDMI inputs, built-in AirPlay, an iOS/Android app, DLNA compatibility, and built-in streaming audio services like Pandora, Sirius, Internet radio and excellent sound quality.What I liked about this unit:- Excellent setup features with excellent results using my Sharp AQUAS TV and 2 Sony 185 watt, 2 Kenwood Bookshelf 65 watt and 2 Pioneer bookshelf 85 watt speakers in a surround sound format.- Computer-assisted setup called Audyssey, including automatic calibration of each speaker using a (supplied) microphone, automatic detection of phase errors (reversed speaker polarity - which I did and it warned me).- Excellent menus for configuring the input devices, including customizing the labels that are displayed for each on the menu that is HDMI connected to the TV-Remote very efficient to use and aesthetically pleasing- Support for speakers in a separate room (zone 2). The second zone has its own volume control and can even play something entirely different than the main room (e.g. TV in the main room and FM or Internet radio in Zone 2).- Separate power amp for each speaker. Many reasons why this is a good design (especially manual manipulation of each speaker)- Besides Internet radio, the network connection enables the unit to automatically update its software so you get the latest & greatest features & bug fixes ( if you have an Ethernet cable and access handy - if not, your out of luck as this unit is NOT wireless)- iPhone accessible using AirPlay that few players have -the songs on my iPhone can rock a house and never have to plug it in- Denon Remote App smartphone app is way cool. I used it on my new iPhone 5 and it helps knowing that if you lost or broke remote, your app can handle many of its dutiesWhat I did not like:- No digital (HD) FM receiver - analog radio only- Little measurable difference between Movie and Game surround settings- Only wired networking; no wireless, but had NetGear 8 port switch within 6 feet, BUT big issue for people that only have wireless.- Stereo mode cuts off surround sound back speakers completely. Would have been more useful if designed to play surround sound but if switched to stereo automatically sync back speaker to Left and Right Stereo- More AV receiver than needed and not sure if the extra cost was worth it as the 1713 may be more than enough to meet the average-Few manual settings can be made without remote to which this unit is TOTALLY dependent onConclusion: The Denon AVR-1913 is a well-rounded AV system for any audiophile that has many AV devices to connect.  Built-in streaming audio services like Pandora, Sirius, iPhone Airplay and Internet radio just add to the features of this unit.  The AVR-1913 is overkill for many home systems but can deliver where and when it counts.", "\"I currently own aHarman Kardon AVR 235 7.1-Channel Audio/Video Surround Receiverwhich has served me really well for the past 8 years, however, I always dreamt of owning a Denon receiver some day due to all the glowing reviews I've seen over the years.  When I was setting up my home theater in the basement the Denon was the first thing that came to my mind.Initially, I was thinking of going in for the AVR-1713 since I really needed just a 5.1 receiver.  However, I wanted to make my purchase a little future-proof at least for the next few years, so I decided to go in for the AVR-1913.I've been using the Denon AVR-1913 for the past few weeks and I've come to realize that it's exactly what I wanted and more.  I've connectedPolk Audio TSi400 Floorstanding Speaker (Single, Black)as Front L&R;,Polk Audio CS20 Center Channel Speaker (Single, Black)as Center,Polk Audio OWM3 On-Wall Speaker (Pair, Black)as Surround L&R;, and thePolk Audio PSW111 Subwoofer (Single, Black)to this marvelous receiver.For inputs, I have Verizon FIOS HD Set Top box, a Nintendo Wii and a Sony PS3.  I'm using the ViewSonic Pro8200 projector as my display (96\"\").  I also connect my laptop occasionally to watch YouTube videos through the projector.The setup is amazingly simple and user-friendly.  The room calibration setup mic (Audyssey MultEQ) does a decent job of setting up the levels & distances, however, I'm a little disappointed that they included the apparently better setup mic (Audyssey MultEQ XT) with the AVR-1713 and not with the AVR-1913.  The sound quality is simply awesome for both music and movies.  I'm hearing sound frequencies from this system that I had never before heard from my Harman Kardon/JBL system in my living room. The dialogues from the center channel speaker make you feel like it's happening right there.  The surround effects are also very precise and clear, you could almost hear a pin drop in the background.  For action scenes and music, the front L&R; speakers just come alive and create a fantastic sound stage like one I've never experienced before.  Due to the classic sound and video from this receiver I don't feel like spending big bucks at the cinema theaters anymore.I haven't played around too much with the audio settings but suffice to say that you can fine tune it to suit your needs.  The Internet Radio option lets you play Pandora and other radio stations seamlessly as long as you're connected to a network.  The Apple AirPlay feature is also nice to play music from your iPhone.  I haven't really tested the video upscaling to 1080p since most of the content I watch is HD anyway.  Nor have I tried the DLNA feature to stream music from my PC.  I tried connecting my iPhone5 to the front USB port but it wouldn't work.  That doesn't bother me since I use the AirPlay feature.  I'm currently running in 5.1 mode, but plan on adding Zone 2 speakers sometime later.It's a great looking receiver with an equally good setup menu.  I think the iPhone Denon Remote App works very well and is fully functional once connected to the network.  The receiver doesn't seem to heat up much either.The only negative things I can think of are that it doesn't come with a Wi-Fi dongle and the remote control is not backlit.  I had to buy the Edimax EW-7438RPn 300Mbps Wireless 802.11/b/g/n Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender (EW-7438RPn) to connect the AVR-1913 to the network.  Other than that this is a really well designed and high-performing audio-video receiver at a very reasonable price.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking to buy an excellent 7.1 home theater receiver.\"", "I'm hopeful that this is my last receiver.  I finally have great surround sound and once you get it set up, it's easy to use.  i did have to use Customer Service and the Rep was very knowledgeable and NICE.  (Haven't gotten that kind of Customer Service since my last call to Amazon! ;-)  Other reviewers are correct that the manual is a bit confusing but I think the really bad reviews if that sense come from real beginners because I got everything I needed out of it except how to configure the Audio Return Channel.  I call and 2 minutes later it was working p[perfectly.  I love this receiver!
