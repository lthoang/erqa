I was pretty impressed with what you can do with this program. It is easy to find places and plan trips. (The first thing I did with the program was to chart out one of our upcoming summer trips.)  I'm glad Canada is included.You can create routes, reverse the routes, add to your route, find nearby places, and more. I'm going to play with the pushpin functions and add notes as I become more familiar with it.One feature, that I'll use closer to actual trips is the \"\"Download Construction Updates\"\" feature. You have to be connected to the Internet for this, but I think it could be handy if it provides up to date accurate information.The software does a lot and there is a help feature as well as tips and tricks on using the program at the website. (Again, must go on-line for this.)This is the first program like this I have used, and I've only used on-line programs a bit. (I'm still old school and like paper maps.) So I can't compare it to other versions. However, for what this program is and does, it does it well. I'm happy with it and see myself using it for various trips.\"", "We have used Microsoft Streets and Trips for years.  Our last purchase was 2006.  Every one of these products worked well and was accurate.  This 2013 version seems to be just as good as the others and just as easy to use.  My wife loaded it onto her PC (it will not run on a Mac).  My wife is running Windows 7 on a Toshiba PC (5i processor).  Anyway, it works great.We do not take out of the way trips.  Most of our travels are pretty average.  We go from Dayton, NV (where we live) to Bend, OR, for example, which is a very straightforward trip.  We have traveled over a lot of the USA and past editions of Streets and Trips has always been very useful and accurate; however, we have not gone to Canada or Mexico by car and we do not travel off road.  We have not tried the ratings of businesses - which are new to this version - but the maps do show where gas stations are as well as eating establishments so they work well for us.We highly recommend this program.AD2", "Google Maps, Bing maps, etc. just don't have all the features this software has. I like it for route planning and adding stops is really easy. Also like the excel import feature for when I have a long list of addresses. I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft and for whatever reason it was cheaper ordering the physical DVD-ROM over a digital download and entering the serial number from it to the trial to activate it.", "\"I already had Streets & Trips 2011 on my PC and should have just left it there. Unfortunately I chose to delete the 2011 and install the 2013. I did not have a lot of maps stored on 2011 therefore I had nothing much to lose. The installation was being made on a fairly new and powerful Gateway PC. Could not install on my Mac as this software is only for PCs. The installation was easy however when I went to the window to insert the product key, that key was repeatedly rejected. The error message was that I should use the telephone. By the way this is a brand new copy of Streets & Trips that Amazon sent me through the Vine Program for review. After going on line and stating I could validate using the phone I then connected with a recorder that ask me for numbers that appeared on the screen. After a few minutes of inserting new numbers on the window screen I receive a message that the product had been validated. What a pain Microsoft! This should not have taken that long on a less than $30 product and I should not have to jump through hoops.After validation I was able to open the program and what I saw looked to me as though I was opening the old 2011 version. I checked and no  I was actually opening the new 2013 version of Streets & Trips. The product write up indicates that the soft ware can be used without an internet connection and that is true. Having this software would certainly be a plus if you did not have internet. However if you have internet almost any mapping available will be far easier to use and much more complete than the Streets & Trips software.The following is writen about the product, \"\"Updated street level maps of the United States and Canada and more than 2.5 million points of interest from America's #1 travel and maps software\"\". Since I was about to take a trip to Western Kentucky I thought this would be a good time to check this out. I looked for the Fairfield Inn in Paducah, Kentucky where I stayed the middle of 2012. That hotel was no where to be found in the software. I looked for updates and was unable to find any updates. Then I noted the Executive Inn was listed for downtown Paducah. The only problem is that I happen to know the Executive Inn was torn down in early 2012 and no longer exist. Thus I just gave up on trying to use this software for this trip.I have yet to find those customer ratings and reviews on businesses referred to in the Microsoft write up. The no internet connection required is great for those unable to access the internet. However since I have high speed internet I plan on sticking to Google and will use this software as a back up if my internet is down.I just cannot give this software a higher rating. This is one product Microsoft needs to drop and spend some time re-developing.\"", "Although the published System Requirements for Microsoft Streets & Trips 2013 do not include Windows 8, this program easily installed and runs on my Windows 8 computer.I quickly found one inaccuracy in the map of the area around my home - a street, that the map indicated was a dead end, is actually a through street.  Also, the points of interest found several restaurants in my area that are no longer in business.  I do not regard this as a major issue because no map is going to be perfect and the maps in my Garmin GPS also incorrectly show this same street as a dead end.  And the GPS sometimes also displays restaurants that are out of business.While I cannot plan a trip on my GPS, I can do extensive planning before leaving home with this program.  But I can also do route planning at home using one of several online services, such as Google Maps. So, the question for me is: Why shell out $20 (the price of this program as of the date of this review) when I can get route planning services for free online?  The answer is that this program has several advantages over online services.First and most obviously, internet access is not needed to use this program.  Next, I can save a trip as a file on my computer and quickly access it for future reference.  Also, this program has extensive points of interest (such as hotels and restaurants) and these points of interest can be quickly accessed.  In short, trip planning is a bit easier using this program as opposed to an online service.On the downside, I did not find that navigating through this program for the first time was particularly intuitive, but after I had some experience with it, I now have no problem setting up trip routes and finding points of interest nearby particular locations.", "The only downside to this program is that it was a bit difficult to start up and get into it.  Once there, it was a snap and worked very well.  Combined with the GPS and it is a very useful product because it has a lot more information that the GPS program as far as places to visit and see. What you can do is download the informationg from this program into the GPS and they work together.", "Some may say this product is becoming a bit dated and perhaps it is . . . however, it still works very well!  I load this on my laptop which is a must have companion with all my road trips anyway.  There is just no substitute for having a 17&#34; high definition screen along with me in my vehicle.  The turn-by-turn voice navigation works very well.  I long ago updated my plugin satellite GPS receiver which made a noticeable difference in staying connected to my tracking signals.  The points of interest are updated with each new version and they are comprehensive.Yes, you can now use your smartphone but you'll spend a fortune in data charges.  The dash mounted GPS boxes are good but just like your smartphone, you'll be limited to a small size screen.  Once you've used a 15-17&#34; laptop screen you'll be spoiled!  The laptop allows me to move it to either of my two vehicles and I can spend the night in my hotel room plotting my next course on it.  You can't do that on a permanently car mounted nav system.", "Have used Microsoft Streets for the past 12 years as a trucker. I use in in conjunction with my Garmin gps unite. It usually finds things that the gps unite wont. There are a few things that Microsoft could improve on, such as the options of using toll roads or not when figure out a given route.", "This is a great planning software for my utility site visits.  I use it for all my route planning, and have had previous versions over the past few years.", "This software hasn't changed in a decade, it works pretty good, until you want to actually use it without printing out everything on paper. The software used to, and is designed to export GPX files for use with GPS devices. But this version creates corrupted GPX files and Microsoft is well aware. Their forums are fill with people having the same trouble, and their tech support said there will be a service pack, of which I am still not aware of.", "I needed to find my way to a major campground but it didn't find the campground I was staying at; although Mapquest did. That was the first clue about how the two mapping software programs compare.I was not able to test how well this program shares it's information with a Garmin GPS since I don't have one. I use a Magellan.Using the program is a bit clunky. For example, if I try to measure the distance between two points, the program will draw a line with lots of points between the starting and ending points. It is difficult to remove once you create it and it needlessly marks up your view. Further, after creating a route, and then trying to zoom and move around the route, several times I accidentally caused the program to change the route and I had to start over.I believe the program provides too much information when creating a route. What I mean is when you are driving on an interstate, let's say I95, and you need to stay on I95 until you get to I495. I don't need, or want, 15 lines of information guiding me between those two points. I would prefer to simply know that I need to stay on I95 for x number of miles and then to get onto I495.It would be very very nice if I could draw a rectangle and have the program zoom to the area within that rectangle. Instead, what you get for zooming is using the plus (zoom in) and minus (zoom out) buttons. I found it difficult to follow a route when using this because it often zooms too much (or too little) and it doesn't always zoom exactly where you would want it to forcing you to re-navigate to where you wanted to look at.Overall, the only reason I find that I would want to use this program (instead of using Mapquest on the internet) is if I didn't have access to the internet. So, it would be useful if it was loaded on a laptop during a trip.", "\"I am glad that there is still a software that one can map out routes and maps still! GPS has almost made this type of software obsolete, but, I actually prefer this software! I had a program years ago that was similar to this and was happy to get this one. I like it and have already found it very useful. I don't really care about the \"\"points of Interest\"\" though. All in all a pretty good mapping program.\"", "All of the older versions of Streets and Trips have the same problem as this version.  When I plan a long trip, I know what time the Motels will let you check-in.  Often the trip planner will overnight you where there are no motels within 50 of 60 miles on their selected route.  For example we want to follow a certain road for historical reasons and no mater what you select as to the preferred roads, IF you do not select a place on that road every 25 miles or so, the planner will send you someplace you did not plan to go. We prefer certain motels because we have a dog that must go with us and the road planner helps us find the motel we want within 25 to 50 miles of where we desire to spend the night on the route we want.  Hard to do but manageable.", "Had couple older versions and was great.Got this 2013 version and won't install on my new Windows 8 machine. From what I read, I needed to reinstall or refresh Windows 8, perhaps do to a previous bad shunt down, corrupted registry or conflict with other software - don't know but don't have problems installing other software on this machine. I guess it doesn't like non Metro apps even its from Microsoft.Getting real help from Microsoft maybe a challenge or need to pay additional for support.=======================Update: Had to call Microsoft. connected me to India for tech support. Tech guy got control of my desktop and reset S&T;, no need for reinstall or refresh Windows 8. Works now. This is a license for two computers (my desktop and laptop), pretty nice. Hope I don't run into this problem with the laptop installation. From start to finish took about 30 minutes, actual tech fix was only about 15 minutes or less. So far so good, my desktop did behave a little different after the reset, but so far all works well. Doesn't seem like I needed to update to 2013 S&T; from the previous version, but time will tell.", "This is the third or fourth version of this I've bought over the past decade and clearly I like it.  This latest version is as good as the previous ones and seems to have a lot of new points of interest locations and street details.  It would be great if I could just update the maps without installing the whole new application (like I can on my Garmin) but I'm sure Microsoft needs the money.UPDATE (3/14'2014):  Had to take away two stars as this does not work with Windows 8???  What's that all about?", "What is the SAVE option for. If next years version can not read this year why bother saving those 3000 mile trips you make with your Dad to redo with your kids?Microsoft, get rid of the SAVE option it is pointless.I started with S&T; 2002, think it is downstairs somewhere. I usually buy every other year. Guess I need to buy 2011 and hope I take the 2009 files to 2011 then to 2013. Or just reenter the ones I need. How stupid is Microsoft for this pain in the aXX.The new S&T; 2013 DOES NOT open my 2009 S&T; files. I have been using the S&T; product line since 2002. Every new version has read the old file but once upgraded to the new version the old version can not read the files. This is the first time the new version 2013 can not read the old version. Luckily I kept 2009 when the installation program asked if I wanted to keep the old addition.2013 looks like a waste of money, unless you are ready to start fresh, with no use of your old maps.Ok, on the phone with Microsoft and they were very helpful. Microsoft will give me S&T; 2011 as I registered 2013 so I can open my old 2009 files in 2011, then save them and then open them is 2013. I guess I will never be able to skip a Microsoft upgrade again. I am not sure which old maps I need and which ones I do not so I guess i will just spend hours upon hours of upgrading from 2009 to 2013 via 2011.d&eacute;j&agrave; vu Quicken does the same crap. I never upgraded because Quicken ver 8 works for me just fine, but it is getting harder and harder to run dos in windows 7 and still be able to print checks.=================NOTE - MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT CAN NOT GET ANY OF MY 2009 MAPS INTO 2013. HOW STUPID IS THIS.ALL MY OLD NOTES AND MAPS MUST BE USED IN 2009. I AM DONE WITH STREETS & TRIPS=================", "\"MS has changed the menu icons from multicolor and eye appealing to very flat, basic two-tone blank and white. This obviously doesn't impact the functionality of the software but it just looks like a step backward.Like many other reviewers, I have an old version of this product that I loved; it had a few bugs, but it was relatively easy to use and did what it was supposed to do. I wasn't impressed by the 2011 version, and was hoping for improvements in 2013. Unfortunately, little other than the maps has been updated. It is a more powerful mapping method than a GPS device or online map, however google maps is getting more powerful all the time (while retaining useability), and Microsoft will soon loose its advantages.-Using the more powerful features of the program is not intuitive, and changing the icons to black and white squares that all look similar didn't help.-It is only possible to \"\"share trip details\"\" with friends and family that also have Microsoft Streets; i.e. the information isn't saved into a pdf or other easily shareable document of some sort.-If the maps of your GPS device don't match Streets', you've got a problem. (The GPS maps were updated 3 mo. ago, but there's still some sort of conflict.)\"", "This review is for the non-GPS version of Microsoft Streets & Trips 2013. In the past, I have been using Streets&Trips; 2006 and 2009. I also have two portable GPS devices as my guidance while I am on the road. The purpose of having the Streets&Trips; Software is mainly for trip planning. In trip planning, I prefer to use MS Streets&Trips; than the on-line based maps (Google map, bing map...etc) for following reasons:1. Speed: I have high-speed internet connection (13Mbps down/6Mbps up), but the speed of MS Streets&Trips; is still far faster than any internet-based map service. I like the instantaneous response in zooming in/out, and quick panning movement.2. Control: I can save my map with directions and locations as a file. Every planned trip becomes a single map file that can be easily reviewed at later time. Just double click the file when I am ready to use it. This is especially useful when I am on a multi-day trip. At night, I just open the map file to review tomorrow's trip.3. Off-line: No need to worry about the weak and slow wireless connection from the hotel.4. Point-of-Interest: The MS Streets&Trips; shows point-of-interest with clear icons. That makes trip planning life much easier. I can easily see how many hotels/restaurants are around my destinations.5. Multiple Destinations: MS Streets&Trips; is especially good if you have more than 3 stops on a trip. You can organize your stops in the order you want and the program will generate detailed directions from one stop to next stop.6. Printing: With the on-line map (either Google map, bing map, or yahoo map), you are not able to control the print out boundary. With MS Streets&Trips;, I can zoom in/out the map to get exact print out.7. Add Comment: I can easily add comments to the map for easy referencing purpose.I don't run into any installation issue when installing it to my Window 7 64-bit PC. However, I agree with other reviewers that MS Streets&Trips; 2013 does not seem to be much different from MS Streets&Trips; 2009. Unfortunately, MS Streets&Trips; 2009 can not be run on 64-bit PC. So, I need the MS Streets&Trips; to be run on 64-bit PC.In summary, GPS is very helpful while you are on the road, but GPS is not good for trip planning. On-line map is convenient but can not be tailored to fit each person's need. The MS Streets&Trips; is definitely a great software in trip planning. I highly recommend it.", "I've been a Streets & Trips user since it was first released. Way back when, it was a thrill, especially as new features such as connectivity with a GPS were added. Streets & Trips served me well for a long time. Competitors like Rand-McNally and others came and went. The seemingly strongest of the lot, DeLorme, has hung in there with an increasingly clunky, always difficult to use interface. For a while, I had both Microsoft Streets & Trips and DeLorme Street Atlas on my laptop.I use Streets & Trips only for personal route planning. I don't map databases to it for deliveries or sales prospecting or the many other business purposes others use it for. I just use it for getting from Point A to Point B with maybe a couple of other destinations thrown in. Back a few years ago, I would also use it for locating lodging and other points of interest along my route.The Streets & Trips 2013 interface doesn't seem much changed from prior years but the truth is that I don't care any more.With Google Maps on my smartphone and Android tablet, I don't need to take my laptop with me - and Streets & Trips doesn't run on the devices I do carry. As well, I have a TomTom GPS in the car which also does the job. For that matter, I can also use Microsoft's own Bing Maps.So what to make of Streets & Trips 2013? It's still a perfectly adequate mapping application for my purposes. I've always found it to be stable. Directions were adequate most of the time, though like every mapping program or service, it had its problems with missing addresses, wrongly located addresses and so on. The Points Of Interest listings are still, in my opinion, so-so, but I'm not a big fan of the POI listings on any of the services.Streets & Trips 2013 is still an eminently usable and helpful application for my needs, but I think the technology has passed it by. For my limited needs, why would I use a laptop-bound application when I can accomplish the same purpose with Google Maps on my Android smartphone?Still a good program, but not one I'll be using as much as I did in the past.Jerry", "I've been using Streets and Trips for years, and it is an incredibly useful product for planning trips, finding locations, locating points of interest and etc.  This year's update brings the total of points of interest to 2.5MM and adds over 150,000 miles of roads.  In addition, this new update includes ratings of restaurants, hotels and other points of interest and allows you to personalize your maps with notes; a terrific feature.Highly recommended", "I'm new to Microsoft Streets and Trips. I found the 2013 version very easy to install and easy to use on my windows 7 operating system. It has lots of neat features. I've found it most useful for planning trips and locating where my friends and family live in comparison to our house. Plugging addresses in like this has been very helpful in getting a visual for how close or far away we are from one another.", "This is one of the best products available for offline navigation. Unfortunately, it does not work on Win 8 - or maybe I should say, sometimes it does and sometimes it does not.I keep hoping that Microsoft comes up with a fix and will be checking Microsoft's announcements related to this product because I'd gladly purchase it again.", "Microsoft Streets has been out for years and I have spoken with major fans of this product. So I know it has a loyal following among some. But it seems to be a select number of people.And I am not one of them - but it isn't because the product is flawed in terms of what it does. What it simply comes down to (for me and maybe you) is this: having tested Microsoft Streets, I don't use it often and can't see that I will. I simply prefer programs I already use on my portable and other devices.They fulfill my purposes. I haven't yet found a compelling reason to switch.However, if you take plenty of business trips or vacations and you want to plan your routes ahead of time, Microsoft Streets might appeal to you. It will highlight interesting attractions along the way, places you might want to explore. You can calculate your fuel costs and see business ratings. All are nice features.But the vast majority of my navigation focuses on places in my area-  rather than trips. So I don't need all the features of a more elaborate program. I have a good sense of how much fuel I use getting from one point to another and the variables which affect that.Bottom line: If you are using online map services as well as portable navigators and are still dissatisfied then Microsoft Streets is worth a look, especially if you take frequent trips. Also, Internet connection is not required and I can see how this would be a plus for some.", "Microsoft Streets and Trips has been around for a long time, with updated software coming out, improving upon the old.This version (2013) does exactly that--using GPS and updated routing capabilities.Why do I say that it's antiquated?  Microsoft hasn't done a lot to streamline it's program.  The installation was complicated and getting it to pair with the GPS was insane...Many frozen sessions where you are forced to close the program.  Once it was set up, it didn't remain so.  Repeated frustrating sessions in locating the GPS.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  I ran this program on a Dell laptop with Win 7...the laptop is about 4 years old.  It could be the computer.  Perhaps a newer computer with Win 8 might be more user-friendly.Why is it revolutionary?  It's got great route planning and many POIs.  Far more than my traditional GPSs (I have a Garmin and a TomTom).  They have links to reviews of hotels, restaurants, etc--this is a nice addition.  The POIs don't need an Internet connection, because it's all contained in the program.You can put pushpins all over your route, and you can change the route easily, or avoid area easily (say there was construction on the freeway--you want to avoid it--it allows you to square off an area, and it will route you around it).I'm not quite sure how this program's basic GPS program is superior (for most users) to the GPSs that are on most smartphones now.  I use the iPhone's new maps and GPS direction program (it's GREAT, btw) or a couple of different apps on my Google tablet.  I guess if you like to plan your trips on a computer rather than on a smartphone or tablet, this would be a good choice.There is a website that has a bunch of new tips and tricks that are useful when using this program.  If you search online for Laptop GPS World . com, and  749 Tips and Tricks for Microsoft Streets and Trips, it should take you to a site that has 84 (and counting) videos and posts, along with a bulletin board discussion on the program.  I'll put the link here, but Amazon might not allow it to post... www . laptopgpsworld . com / 749-tips-tricks  (spaces omitted).There are certainly ways to create very complicated and detailed itineraries with this program.  I think if you're traveling like this, using a computer would indeed be more efficient than using a phone or tablet.", "This program has been around for decades and apparently hasn't changed much in all that time (except for periodic updates to the map data). Compared to free online mapping programs, Microsoft Maps has a sluggish user interface and the maps are kind of ragged. There is some basic searching and navigation functionality. Of course, updates to the map data are much less frequent than with the online products. Sharing map data between apps and between devices and between users has pretty minimal functionality compared to the cloud-based maps. There is no pedestrian mode or bicycle mode like you find in Google Maps; Microsoft is for cars only.Google Maps does have some off-line capabilities now days (may be for certain devices only). You should try that out before buying this program. Off-line support is, of course, the main reason to buy this program.Another advantage of Microsoft Maps over Google Maps is that printing works much better with Microsoft. Microsoft gives you more control over what and how much detail gets printed. On the other hand, Google Maps are easy to share with your smartphone or tablet so you may have no need for printing.", "I upgraded or should I say partially upgraded from Streets and Trips 2010 to Streets and Trips 2013. I have found many points of interest that were in the 2010 version are not in this one. While there are many new points of interest added they do not outweigh the fact that they have removed many more than they have added. I work in the restaurant service industry and visit @ 8 different restaurants a day. I have to use google several times a day to find my next job because it isn't shown on the map. It works well with a gps receiver like the other versions do.  They have changed the menu buttons to black and white images which I consider to be a downgrade as well. I think I may research some other brand software and switch soon. Bottom line....if you are upgrading from another version to this one you may be disappointed.", "Microsoft Streets and Trips 2013I have a previous version of Microsoft Streets and Trips that isn't much different from this version.It was able to install on my older Windows XP netbook computer that doesn't have a CDROM drive.  You can go online and install the trial version.  Then you use the product key to unlock it.The map itself seems pretty good overall.  However, here in San Diego it still doesn't show highway 52 connecting with highway 67 through Santee, which has been completed for quite some time now.The software is great for planning trips.  It specializes in details like your personal driving speed, gas mileage, gas tank size, price of gas and finding nearby places.Bottom line:  Good for trip planning; use Google Maps for everything else.", "\"I was using the 2004 version prior to this one. The layout is basically the same but more features have been added, such as the integration with a GPS device and the ability to send a map to a mobile phone.  Everything is laid out in an organized and easy to use manner. I'm not sure when Microsoft changed it but one feature I like that was lacking in 2004 is the ability to drag the map by holding down the left mouse button. 2004 lacked the ability to do this and to shift the map one had to point the arrow at one of the map borders and click to make the map move. This made it difficult to move the map to the exact view you wanted to see. 2013 enables you to move it by both methods. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal but the lack of a dragging mechanism always annoyed me about 2004.With it being so easy to get maps and directions on the internet, Microsoft has a lot of competition especially since the maps on the internet are free. However, I like Streets and Trips for its detail, the ability to map out a wide area, and to have so many features all in one program, and to be able to save the maps and routes. Something else I like is being able to measure the distance of any route on the map.  For example, if I go running or walking for exercise, I can either measure the distance I went after I come back or if I want to plan a running route of a specific distance I can figure it out on the map before going.The only \"\"con\"\" about the program is I noticed some of the points of interest are outdated and some by a couple of years or more. In fact, a few of them I don't even remember being there at all. That said, most of the points are correct so my rating is closer to 4.5 stars rather than 4.I do have a GPS unit but it is rather old so it doesn't work with this program.  I also hate cell phones so I have not tried to export a map to my phone. I like this program because it's like working with a traditional map with the convenience of point and click features.Overall I find this to be a worthwhile upgrade from my old 2004 version and I also find this to be a handy bit of software to have around.\"", "I purchased this to replace my 2005 version. The first day I used it I entered my home address and it brought me to another sudvision 2 miles away. I called MS and explained my problem and after being switched to 4 different people I talked to a woman in India. Her accent was terrible. I could hardly understand her. She took control of my computer remotely. I think she didn't know what to do and tried telling me that's the way it suppose to be. I called back and got someone in the Phillipines. That person switch me to another tech. To prove I had a problem I had to reload the 2005 version and let the tech guy remotely take over my computer to show him that my street comes up correct on 2005 and not on 2013. He couldn't help either. So I gave up. I Wasted about and hour with the so called 6 support people that I spoke with. None of which even have the street and trips software loaded on their computers. I left the old version on my computer to compare maps incase the new version is wrong again.In all fairness I have to correct my previous review. With my previous 2005 software I didn't have to add a NE to the street address. With the new 2013 software I have to type in North-streetname- then NE. Figured it out just by accident. Now I can start a trip from my house and not from the main road.", "I have been using Streets and Trips for a number of years and find it a great product. The last version I had on my computer was 2010, but when  I had a chance to upgrade to 2013, I did.There are two people who probably are reading this review. Those who have never used Streets and Trips, and those who are already using it and wonder if they should upgrade.If you have never used it, and are looking for a travel/map program, this is a great one. It is simple to add pushpins to the map and then build a trip out of all the locations you want to see. When you create the route it assembles them in the best order and draws the route for you. If you add or subtract something it will automatically adjust. It can send the route to your GPS, or phone - or you can connect a GPS to your laptop and have an amazing in-car GPS Nav system. You can set up various pins for different types of locations and tell the computer what kind of route you want (slow and scenic - fast and direct, etc. and it will adjust for it).It you already have Streets and are wondering whether to upgrade, they have added many new points of interest which I think is critical in my travels. Operation hasn't changed much - the interface is a bit more streamlined, but all the operations are similar to past versions. Perhaps my favorite new feature is the ability to switch to Bing maps satellite view  right from the map you are looking at. That is a great idea and I had wondered why they hadn't done it earlier. If your version is more than a couple years old, the additions of new locations is also probably well worth  the upgrade.", "Features2.5M points of interestNew maps with 150K more miles of roadsView Ratings on restaurants, hotels, and more when onlinePersonalize your maps with notes and add points of interestPlan you trip then share with your Garmin device for navigation on the go.Requires Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server, or Windows XP - One 1GB RAM,2 GB of ram on the hard drive.

Streets and Trips has been my go-to for years, and still is. Although I think it's far from perfect, it is far better than other options out there.This most recent version of Streets and Trips is not an update from the previous version, in fact, if you own Streets and Trips 2010, just keep using it.If you don't own Streets and Trips yet, this version is as stable as any of the others, and the new lower price point is nice, so go ahead and buy it."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.11173800379037857, 0.0011965320445597172, 0.017487719655036926, 0.004388609901070595, 0.05947595834732056, 0.02106042020022869, 0.0001376749569317326, 0.06734072417020798, 0.00442326907068491, 0.07008857280015945, 0.0013499150518327951, 0.06297004222869873, 0.07908269017934799, 0.037661559879779816, 0.00022093518055044115, 0.0021597815211862326, 0.03276733681559563, 0.06022102013230324, 7.87680473877117e-05, 0.0004083595995325595, 0.0824170932173729, 0.07395446300506592, 0.08252394199371338, 0.0001173924101749435, 0.0010469205444678664, 0.014274233020842075, 0.0002146538026863709, 0.00029703640029765666, 0.07580201327800751, 0.0013341873418539762, 0.0002002125547733158, 0.03355999290943146]]}
