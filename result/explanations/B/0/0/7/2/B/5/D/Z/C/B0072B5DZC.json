Decided to give the Panasonick HCV700K a try.  After a nice price drop on Amazon, pulled the plug.  Delivered in just a few days, it was packed very well.  First look at the camera you will notice how easy it is to use.  The visual prompts are easy to understand.  SD card worked right out of the box with no set up needed.  The wide angle viewing is a great feature to capture the whole visual you are shooting.  Zoom is unbelievably long, and hi-def video is amazing.  The color saturation is fantastic on auto (what I use most), and attaching to LCD TV for viewing is quite simple. One of the best features is the anti-shake feature on the Camcorder.  Even at long range, it takes the jitter out of the shot.  So if you don't have a steady hand, get this Camcorder.  Panasonic has solved the problem.  I've used Sony products for quite some time, but I have to say this Panasonic Camcorder is a cut above.  Key factor:  Simplicity.  Simple to understand, and simple to use.", "\"Brain Dump Follows: Well, I'm keeping it, but I have some concerns. Today is the last day for me to return it and when I was outside today in the cold shooting some footage, for the first time there was some lateral image shake when zooming at the maximum speed. I also noticed for the first time today that when you zoom at the maximum speed, (something which you would rarely do unless you are frequently filming fleeing perpetrators), there is a motor/gear noise faintly in the background if there is no other sound being recorded and if the mike is set to the non-zoom setting. I use the non-zoom setting when I am doing narration. The noise I could live with, though it is a little disappointing. The image shake, jarred my nerves in a big way. I checked the zoom repeatedly when inside, both on a stable surface and hand held with OIS on and off. No image shake. I did it while filming and in standby. It seems like it was a one-time thing. I have been out in the cold with the camcorder before, though not using the zoom at maximum speed. It just does not get used that way as a general rule. Too rough on the viewer.The sound on the unit is great. Very life like. Great for family memories. The image at 1080/60p is very impressive. You can notice the improvement in sharpness over 1080/60i. Please note that the progressive is actually PSF=progressive segmented frame, according to some very knowledgeable folks at the Lightworks forum. Lightworks free cannot handle psf unfortunately. You would have to pay for the pro version. The included HD Writer Software is a little sluggish, but seems to work reasonably well for viewing/reviewing. I have spent so much time learning the camcorder that I have not yet edited or burned a Blu-Ray.The still camera images are pretty worthless. Grainy and soft in sharpness. I bump up the setting for Video to +1 in sharpness and use Intelligent Contrast Control, but no setting improves the still images. Just pretend the feature is not present in the camcorder. Carry a light point and shoot. the pictures from it are far superior to the camcorder still images.The lens performance is amazing. Optical reach is exceptional. The camcorder is relatively light as compared to a camcorder of a few years ago and particularly considering the zoom ratio. The handling position is reasonable. Touch screen works mostly responsive. Only need to touch a second time occasionally. Screen gets full of fingerprints, but they do not show up unless you angle the screen \"\"just so\"\". Be careful not to scratch it. Outdoors even at +2 the screen can be a little dim.In addition to the obvious SDHC card, (I got the Lexar 32GB U1 and it holds up to testing for continuous write at good speeds.), you should get a carrying case, ( I like the Tamrac bags.), a protective 46mm UV filter ( You really do not want to damage the lens doors or front element with a casual bump. I got a B+W multicoated. The clearance to the lens doors was no problem.), an HDMI -> HDMI mini cable ( I got the Xtreme braided. It makes a very firm connection. Watch out for the screen when connecting and disconnecting. The braid is a little rough.), and the Panasonic VW-BC10 external battery charger. I really do not like the idea of charging batteries while in unit for cameras or camcorders. There is more heat generated as a battery ages and I would rather cook a charger than the camera or camcorder. The charger works well and if you get spare batteries, you can always have one charging up. The standard battery is sufficient to fill a 32GB card.The colors render realistic, though when it is overcast, the exposure seems a little dark (underexposed). It takes a few seconds for the Auto White Balance to adjust. If you start shooting too fast, your color rendition will be off. You can saturate the colors with the Digital Cinema setting. Focus works pretty fast. Low light is okay. Some folks may find it a bit grainy, I think it is just fine. Standard illumination is 1400 lx. That is about EV 9~10 at iso 100 on a still camera. This is reasonable.I do not know if the camcorder would be considered broadcast quality, but it is more than excellent for family memories. I just hope this zoom image shake does not come back. Panasonic is NOT known for wonderful customer service or repairs. If you playback on your TV, (mine fortunately can play 1080/60p), it really looks impressive. Maybe not as sharp and contrasty as a 1080/60i Cable TV channel, but close in quality. On the computer screen you won't notice as much detail as on your TV. Probably something about the size of the pixels.For the price you cannot beat this camcorder and the compact size and weight is a bonus. End Brain Dump. :-) Recommended with some concerns. I would buy again assuming it does not fail on me. If you find an angry followup you'll know my decision was bad.P.S. for those wondering why I don't just try an exchange, here's why. Most everything works perfectly, and I suspect the zoom motor noise is because the gears and motor are brand new and that might explain the one-time image jitter too. If I try another unit, I might get a unit with some other problem that is more likely to cause me to throw in the towel on this. I have spend a lot of time fiddling with this camcorder and really dread the thought of starting all over again. It's a dice roll, but then so is much of life. You have to have a spirit of adventure. :-) I just hope I don't have to eat my words. :-)P.P.S. I did finally get to burn Blu-Ray discs and it was very easy to do. Discs come out really good quality at 1080/60p. No top menu at this maximum resolution. Played back on PC perfectly. Playback on Samsung settop Blu-Ray player was easy with one exception. Without the top menu I had to use the skip button to go from one video to the next sequentially. Not a problem for me. I am impressed how goof proof the burning subroutines of the software were. Still happy with my purchase.\"", "Overall, the camera produces excellent-quality video. The anti-shake thing works well, although it took a bit of getting used to; once I knew how it would affect the image, it became intuitive. The anti-shake is easy to turn on and off too, with a dedicated button on the camera.The auto white-balance thing worked extremely well; within a second or two of turning on the camera, it figured out how to compensate for LED lights, florescent lights, and daylight. It was easy to see whether the color balance was right on the viewing screen, and easy to catch it when there was an error in white balance. The only time I had to set white balance manually was when I had mixed light sources, specifically sunset daylight mixed with florescent lights. I can't fault the camera for not figuring that out.I also loved the compactness of the camera; it's extremely light and easy to hold and operate in one hand. The 16 GB onboard memory in the model I bought was enough for a day of video recording at one of the intermediate-quality HD settings. I also used a removable SD card, which worked seamlessly. If you get an SD card, make sure it's rated at the correct speed, as it turns out there are a whole slew of SD card speeds as well as capacities (who knew?) The onboard mic didn't do well in windy outdoor conditions, but there's an external mic port. For home video it would be fine.Battery life was not amazing, but that's probably true of any electronic device these days; Panasonic sells a higher-capacity battery as an extra, which I would consider if I wanted to shoot outdoors or away from a power socket for very long. It was easy to leave the camera plugged in while filming on a tripod, and I'm pretty sure the battery was being recharged even while the camera was recording.The touch-screen viewing screen works well, and the menus are intuitive enough that they aren't hard to navigate when I was out filming. It was easy to set up framing using the viewing screen, as it has an overlay grid you can turn on and off. Maybe it's standard for video cameras, I don't know, but the viewing screen is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of experience, which works great for me.The included software has quite a few capabilities, like basic splicing of clips, editing out unwanted parts of a clip, even adding simple effects like transitions and titles. For an included add-on, the software does quite a lot. The auto-start part of the software didn't work every time I connected the camera to my computer (Windows 7), but I just started the software manually (from the Start menu) and everything worked fine.Although it's possible to do some editing of video clips right on the camera, I would recommend moving the videos to a computer to work with them, as the software provided for computers can do more than the camera alone, and of course it's easier to work on a bigger screen with a keyboard, etc.", "\"Background:I havent bought/used a camcorder in 10+ years. However, I do enjoy digital photography as a hobby of mine. For the past 2.5 years I have been shooting with a Pentax K-X DSLR, with either the Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 lens or the Pentax DA 50mm f1.4 prime. The K-x does HD video also so my main comparisons and thoughts will be based on what I had seen the K-x do in terms of video. Decided to ultimately buy a dedicated camcorder b/c the lack of active auto-focus in the K-x was a deal breaker in terms of shooting video of my baby girlComparisons to other camcorders in price range:This HC-V700K is Panasonic's mid-range camcorder, its so-to-speak \"\"top of the line consumer\"\" camcorder (next step up being prosumer, Panasonic X900MK). The HC-V700K is for all intents and purposes the 2012 version of the 2011 TM-90K, a very highly rated camcorder in 2011.The two main camcorders i was considering in this price range was this Panasonic V700 and the Canon M500. The Canon M500 is Canon's 2012 successor to 2011's M400. The M400 was probably the best rated mid-range camcorder of 2011, most notably touted for its awesome pro-level sensor and low-light capabilities. The Canon M500 retains basically the same sensor and good low-light capabilities.Why did I end up choosing the Panasonic over the Canon? To be honest, one reason was price. Currently, the Panasonic could be had for about $100 cheaper than the Canon. I think if both were the same price, I would have gone with the Canon. But $100 is a lot of dough these days, and I felt like from my research the differences in video quality between the Canon and Panasonic were probably not great enough (in my needs) to justify the extra money. Second (now I am just going to rationalize my decision more :) ), the Panasonic has a higher resolution LCD than the Canon. Third, the Panasonic is capable of greater zoom than the Canon. Fourth, based on reviews and comments online I have read, the image stabilization in the Panasonic slightly edges out Canon's. Based on my own personal experience, the stabilization is VERY good, especially when zoomed in.First Impressions:Like I said i havent really handled a camcorder in a very long time. I was shocked to see how small and light this thing is. It seems well built enough, although the lack of heft does make it feel a tiny bit \"\"cheap\"\" or \"\"plasticky.\"\" However I can tell that it is a quality product. This camcorder is so small it fits in the side pocket of my DSLR bag. Buttons seem to be in ergonomic areas, and i never found it awkward to use the camcorder. The touch screen LCD seems responsive enough. Yes, in direct sunlight it may be a little hard to see the LCD and a viewfinder would have been nice, but i never found it impossible to shoot outdoors.Performance Impressions:Compared to the video my K-x has taken (and note that the K-x has been heralded for its low-light capabilites, and also I am using very fast lenses), I am VERY impressed with the video this camcorder is capturing. I have compared similar scenes (say, bathtime with my baby) and in all circumstances I prefer the V700's video over my DSLR's video. I will note that I am shooting in the highest quality setting on the V700 (AVCHD 1920x1080/60p), a resolution that my DSLR is not capable of. The image stabilization on the V700 is fantastic. The low-light performance is great as well, and very suitable for any indoor (household) lighting situations i have come across. If you are going to be filming primarily in low-light (think dim restaurant lighting, bar lighting, or nightlight) then maybe spring for the Canon. But typical household lighting conditions, this camcorder will be good enough.Typically Panasonic camcorders have been dinged for less than stellar white balance performance. I have seen some minor issues. For example, take a typical problematic white balance situation: household tungsten light (your typical slightly yellow light bulbs) are on, and there is also a window in the room letting in natural light. The light bulbs are outputting light at a very different temperature than the natural light coming in through the window. The camera will get confused and you will often see your recording change white balances throughout: sometimes your video will be good, sometimes it will be overly yellow, then it will be overly washed out, etc. You can remedy this pretty easily by just setting the white balance manually, if you run into this problem. I set my white balance manually quite frequently when taking pictures with my K-x, so this was a non-issue for me. But if you are the \"\"set it and forget it\"\" type, maybe this will bother you.  I will note that even if I didnt adjust the white balance, none of these \"\"issues\"\" would make me want to return the camera. The video is still good, just sometimes the color will be off slightly.Final thoughts:This camcorder does not have any memory internally. You will HAVE to buy a memory card. I found a lot of people get confused by SD card nomenclature, so let me clear it up: SD cards, SDHC cards, and SDXC card are basically all the same thing. The \"\"HC\"\" and \"\"XC\"\" just let you know the SD card holds more than a typical SD card (GB size).I am using this card and highly recommend it:SanDisk Extreme 16GB SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDX-016G-X46,Black16GB holds almost an hour and half of 1080/60p video. Please ONLY buy from Amazon.com because there is an abundance of fake SD cards out there and buying from a reputable dealer is the best way to protect yourself (i wouldnt even buy a SD card from anything \"\"fulfilled by amazon\"\" ... only Amazon!!)The 700M version of this camcorder comes with internal memory --- but for the price difference I would recommend just buying this camcorder and separately buying an SDHC/SDXC card.To transfer videos from the camcorder to your pc (i am using Windows 7, 64bit) just plug in the camcorder to the USB port and transfer like it is a flash drive. No software install needed. I do not use the included camcorder software.I am using this software to edit my videos:Sony Creative Software Vegas Movie Studio HD 11.0I am very pleased with my purchase and hope this review was helpful to someone.\"", "\"I originally purchased the V500 and found that it was totally unsuited for low light videos so I returned it and purchased the V700MK. The camera is quite hefty and very well built. It takes a 46mm filter. The V500 is not engineered to accept any filters.The menue is pretty straightforward and quite easy to master. It comes with a full printed manual and the camera is \"\"made in Japan\"\" and not China. A big, big plus! Zooming is smooth and quiet. The outdoor videos are terrific and the low light videos are excellent with no noticeable graininess. I havent yet tried to copy a dvd that friends and relatives can view on their own dvd players. I assume a converter program is necessary although Panasonic doesnt mention it in the manual. Im not at all impressed with the cameras warranty. 1 year parts, 90 day labor. It sure doesnt give me a secure feeling when a manufacturer doesnt have at least a 1 years faith in their product. However at this point in time, Im well satisfied. We shall see!UPDATE 8/2: Reduced it to 3 stars as the record button became intermittent and I returned it for a refund. Im back on Amazon looking for something else.\"", "Even though the software is not compatible with Mac OS, it's easy to transfer videos.  The manual specifies:If using Mac- HD Writer AE 4.0 is not available for Mac.- iMovie'11 supported. For details about iMovie'11, please contact Apple Inc.- iMovie'11 is not compatible with 1080/60p. 1080/60p scenes cannot be imported to a Mac.However, you can record in iFrame and is a recording format suitable for viewing and editing on a Mac (iMovie'11). Using iMovie'11, iFrame motion pictures can be imported faster than AVCHD motion pictures. Also, the imported file size of iFrame motion pictures will be smaller than that of AVCHD motion pictures.- It is not compatible with motion picturesrecorded in AVCHD format.- Scenes recorded in 3D are not supported by iMovie'11.Recording in iFrame transfers beautifully to iMovie and iPhoto.  I purchased Adobe Premier Elements for Mac and can transfer recordings in 1080/60P, so that is no longer an issue. I prefer Adobe over iMovie anyway. So far I have no interest in purchasing the 3D conversion lens.You may want to consider getting a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 Flash Memory Card 30MB/s.  Great at high speed transfer!SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 Flash Memory Card 30MB/s SDSDU-064G-AFFPThis camera also takes quality still photos.", "First off, I must say this camera's large sensor and full 1080p recording are not understated. This is the same sensor as cameras twice as expensive in the panasonic line, and the quality is superb. Overall I am very happy with this camera, but I will share a few thoughts that might influence your purchase decision:Pros:- Great wide angle zoom range: I almost bought the canon but this went nearly twice as wide allowing you to get close or film indoors and still capture the full scene. Plus, even with the wide angle the long optical zoom range exceeds what you should practically be using anyway as fully zoomed in the camera shake on anything but a solid tripod makes the film nearly unwatchable so this camera truly has an optical zoom range that gets as wide as you could need, and closer than you practically should be using.- Great sensor: the images are recorded at 60 frames a second at full 1080p, eliminating the trailing lines you get on a 1080i camera. Don't expect to be shooting cinema quality footage, but the quality is sufficient that I went out and got a blu-ray burner and blank blu-rays because there was simply so much more detail that this camera captured that I couldn't bear to part with when archiving & presenting it to friends and family.- Off brand batteries: I immediately bought an off brand charger and extra battery for ~1/4 what panasonic sells them for. If you do this with canon or with some other manufactures you will be missing a coded chip and unable to see the battery status (esp. how much recording time is left) but with panasonic there is no such chip so for less than half what a small extra battery would cost I got a large (3hr) extra battery and an off-camera charger. Accessories are one of the major ways a camera gets more expensive (the canon battery/ charger combo is nearly two hundred dollars) so having a cheap alternative (I spent less than forty) is critical component in decision making when are trying to be price conscious.- Simplicity: I handed this camera to my wife with no directions and she started taking footage without issue. The auto-on when you open the LCD and the obviousness (and standardization) of the zoom lever and record button mean that while you have access to more manual features, it is still something you can pass off to an inexperienced person and not be concerned about them getting confused.- Memory card access: I would HIGHLY recommend this camera over one with internal storage. First, the internal storage is only accessible if you remember your cable and plug your camera into your computer, while the memory card can be removed and inserted into a memory card reader present in nearly any computer made in the last 5-10 years. It does mean you need to be sure you have the memory card with you, but it is worth the convenience in my opinion. Furthermore, Memory has dropped below $1/gb so a 64gb card that could hold more video than 2-3 batteries would allow you to take can be had very cheaply and keep you shooting for days.- Compactness: this is a camera that could easily be thrown in a purse, or in my case added to my DSLR camera bag in less space than a single extra lens would have taken. It is not quite pocket-able, but for carrying with other items it is small, light, and easy to fit in a tight space.- Playback: Many camcorders have pathetic speakers for playback. This one is certainly nothing to write home about quality wise, but for total volume during a quick check to see if you got an important moment it is wonderful and far better than I expected.- LCD: Many have suggested you by a lens hood, but I might suggest you hold off on such a decision. I took it out apple picking on a sunny day and put the lens hood on automatically, but when I took it off I still had no issues. If you are headed to the beach or desert or somewhere with a lot of sun and glare I can see it may become an issue, and the lens hood does help with being able to closely track focus, color & framing, but I was actually perfectly contented outside on a sunny day without a lens hood. Having the lens hood in my bag though does give me the safety net of know I will always be able to see my screen in any circumstance.- Auto-closing lens: I will admit my last video camera is ~10 years old, but having a lens cap that closes on its own whenever the camera is turned off is wonderful to protect the lens from dust and scratches, but is never in the way when you want to shoot. Its pretty much par for the course today, but I just had to say I like this feature.Cons:- Audio Quality: I want to play with the settings more, but I was somewhat underwhelmed by the audio quality. To add to my disappointment, the camera has an add-on cold shoe (where you could mount a mic) but it sticks out at the far back of the camera, so any mic mounted to it would hang over your zoom control. Overall, the audio quality is fine for a personal camcorder, but given the spectacular video results I think I set my expectations too high for the audio, and sadly there isn't a convenient way to bring the camera's fair audio quality up to match its superb video quality.- Touch Screen: for 99% of what you do you won't even use the touch screen, but as others have rightly pointed out, it is not a sensitive touch screen at all. It requires a solid push, and for tasks that involve sliding or dragging it frequently mis-interprets your gesture. Ultimately, I don't find myself using the touch screen much so it is livable, but if you plan on digging into the menus for every scene you may want to look elsewhere for a camera with a more responsive screen.Conclusion:This camera takes excellent video, which is ultimately what I bought it to do. Its audio quality leaves a little to be desired, but it does the job and is more a problem of unrealistic expectations than the audio being sub-par for a consumer camcorder. The compatibility with 3rd party batteries makes the camera cheaper to complement with accessories, and the price for a camera with this good (large) of a sensor is truly unbelievable. Finally, the zoom ranges means you won't find yourself too close or far from your subject allowing you to unobtrusively capture the moment. There are a few trade offs in a camera of this price and size, but on a budget this is a wonderful option for capturing important memories.", "The M indicates a built in memory, but you can also add your own chip for additional memory and choose which memory to use. 3D is only availible with the addition of an expensive large attachment. Who wants to lug that around? Lots of features, great video, handles low light situations with ease. Most people probably buy the 500 but from reading on the internet the 700 shoots a better video in less than ideal lighting conditions. In my opinion it is well worth the money.", "It seems that for every 5 or 6 years, I acquire a new camcorder due to new technology. I want a High Definition camcorder. Reading Consumer reports, various forums, and reviews here at Amazon, I narrow down to Sony, Canon and Panasonic.Primary decision points for me are:1 widescreen2 large sensor3 Optical Image Stabilizer4 decent internal mike even though I also own external zoom mike5 compatible with all my other Panasonic equipments, like TV, Blue Ray player, Viera link, etc. it is like plug in and play.6 Panasonic camcorder seems to accept third party compatible battery without issue.
