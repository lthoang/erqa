"], "reviews": ["I started using the Remington S8590 about a week ago. Until then I was using aRemington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch.The Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor. While I can't really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working. Why? Well, since I replaced my S9500 with the S8590 I've been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Go figure! A flat iron making my hair look healthy.Both Remington flat irons feel great in my hand. Well balanced and sturdy. With the Keratin shine bonus, I'll definitely be using my S8590 daily and save the S9500 for travel.", "I already use a Remington straightener.  This model works better but I am not sure if it is not simply due to the fact the older one is on the decline since I have been using it for two years.This model straigtened my hair more quickly and did a nicer job.  Quicker is important to me.  It has a lock feature that I like to have and it also has an automatic shut off--it shuts off after 60 minutes but I wish it was less than that as a safety feature in case I ever forget to shut it off. I always unplug my straighteners when I am done, but it is always good to have a safety feature.I think this unit runs rather hot.  When I first turned it on, it was at a default setting of 375 degrees.  I use a higher setting on my original one so I also tried 410.  Either way, you run the risk of burning yourself with those settings--I ultimately moved to 345. As you run your hair sections through the plates, a LOT of heat is generated and you need to careful about burning hands, scalp, fingers, ears, etc.  In summer months it is a lot of extra heat that may cause you to want to jump back in the shower!I am very skeptical about the sensor feature.  Sections of hair pass through the blades so quickly I don't see how it could possibly adjust so quickly.  I am also skeptical about infusing Keratin into my hair by using this product.Hair definitely does not glide through the plates as I am used to.  In fact, there is some resistance while passing it over sections of hair and I hope that is not damaging my hair.Overall, I am very happy with the straightener.  I did not give 5 stars because of having to be extra careful handling it and because it does not allow hair to pass through as smoothly as would like.", "The Remington Keratin Therapy Straightener works great!  I use mine more as a gentle curler or flip style to the ends of my hair.  It offers the ability to smooth out my hair as I run it through and then turn and flip the ends gently.  I've used it now several times and am happy with it.  I'm still not quite ready to give up my CHI straightener protection spray.  It's a must, I think.", "\"I have been using the Remington Wet 2 Straight for years but after a recent visit to a hair salon, I knew there were better options out there. The hair stylist used a 1\"\" FHI iron which was great but way out of my price range. This Remington performs just as well as the FHI (and way better than Wet 2 Straight) on my thick, curly, fine, dry(!) hair in my opinion. The Wet 2 Straight and Keratin Therapy irons might be from the same company but they are entirely different. I don't like to use a lot of heat on my hair so I only flat iron it once a week, if that. With the Wet 2 Straight, my hair never looks completely straight and usually becomes wavy in a day or two. With this flat iron, my hair stayed straight until I washed it a week later. It also looks shinier after straightening. As for the heat sensor, who knows if that really works. It sounds very gimmicky but I'm not complaining because they got this flat iron right. If you don't want to spend a lot on an FHI, I would try this one out first.\"", "I've had several hair straighteners through the years and this one is probably my favorite. Lots of straighteners have things that makes that one unique, the selling point for this one is that the floating ceramic plates are infused with keratin, a conditioner which is supposed to last the lifetime of the product. There really wasn't a way for me to tell if that made a difference on my hair or not.The feature that I like is a button that controls an optional heat sensor that automatically adjusts the temp if your hair is dry and damaged. Good for those delicate areas like bangs, etc. I usually have to be careful and not singe my bang area but didn't have any problems with that with this straightener.It also has a one hour automatic shut-off for safety. I always appreciate those features.The hinge lock is also nice. It works well and is easy to lock and unlock, you just slide the switch to open or close. I had one that was a dial switch and it was hard to operate.The buttons are also positioned on the side where they are not in the way when using. I had a different straightener that would get accidentally turned off when I used it because the buttons were right where you held it.It's also just a good size and feels comfortable in my hand.Highly recommend.", "My wife uses this, so here is her review.  This straightener works very well.  It is a great product at a great price.  I like that you can change the heat setting and that it has automatic shut-off.  Some other good features are that it has a lock to keep the straightener shut and the cord is not too long.  Great for storage and travel.  I have been using this for a few weeks, and it does a very nice job with my hair.  I don't know that I see a difference from the keratin, but the Remington S8590 works just as well as my more expensive straightener.  The only downside is that it does not move smoothly over my hair, there is some resistence.  So far, I don't see any damage from that, but I am not sure long term what that means to my hair.  I have never had a straightener do that.  If you are looking for a product that has the features of a very expensive straightener, this is a great buy.", "\"My partner has naturally wavy hair, and always appreciated the idea of a hair straightener, owning several in the past. Unfortunately, the damage to her hair would be always become quite noticeable after only a few uses, making her feel dry and brittle even when using special hair products to compensate. As a result, she gave up on hair straighteners altogether.Warily, at my behest my partner has given \"\"Remington S8590 Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor\"\" a shot for a few days. She is more than pleased with the results. It is the first time she has used a flat iron that has not dried out her hair; on the contrary, her hair feels soft and luxurious after each use. It is ergonomically comfortable to hold, and the automatic senors work really well at ensuring she doesn't fry her hair. I can attest: her hair looks great after each use.Rather than waste time extolling all the virtues of the bells and whistles the \"\"Remington S8590 Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor\"\" (of which this device has  quite a few), I will get to the point: it works, and it works well. For those in need of a hair straightener that does your hair right, look no further. Highly recommended.\"", "\"Isn't it time we stop calling these straightening or flattening irons, and start calling them styling irons?  It's true that was the original intention, but even my hair stylist hardly ever uses a curling iron on customers' hair.  She uses a \"\"styling iron\"\" (and I will call it that), and she does great hair.  I don't know what styling iron she uses; I can't see the brand.  But she buys her own tools, and won't spend money on \"\"professional\"\" tools that don't deliver.  She uses consumer-level straightening irons, one-inch to boot.The product description for this styling iron is similar toRemington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\"\", which I received from Vine and reviewed.  I love it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is such a dinosaur she was still using a curling brush.  Don't worry, my niece knows how to use a styling iron.  She showed my sister how to take at least ten minutes off her morning routine.I like this even better than the Shine Therapy styler.  I still recommend the Shine Therapy, but this is a sleeker, more modern product, and it is an improvement.  The switches are on the side, rather than the top of the styler.  Some people didn't like the placement of the switches on the Shine Therapy because it was easy to bump them.  I don't know what they were talking about; I never had a problem with that.  Nevertheless, that problem is solved with this product.  Both stylers can be set to temperatures as low as 300F, and both have a turbo function.  Both heat up fast, but the Keratin Therapy doesn't require the user to lock in the chosen temperature.  It also doesn't require an unlock before powering down.  That's two less button pushes per use.  Hey, time is important, right?  The display is easier for me to read on the Keratin Therapy.  The plates meet better with the Keratin Therapy, though this is nit-picking; the plates are fine on both.  This model, however, is lighter and easier to hold than the Shine Therapy, so I give it five stars.  Oh, yes, it also has a lock feature to hold the plates together for storage.Between the two, you can shop for price or shop for functionality.  I gave the Shine Therapy four stars because of the silly claim of infusing it with avocado oil.  I'm not going to bother removing a star for the claims of keratin infusion on this item.  You already know keratin is part of your hair, and hair can burn.  I don't know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  They don't need to do that.  I've bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.If you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  It's amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.\"", "\"It's too early to tell whether the Keratin infusion and smart sensor are anything more than gimmicks, but as a ceramic flat iron it gets the job done, if not quite as smoothly as higher priced units.As others have noted, the iron tends to run a bit hot.  I set it lower than I do with a more expensive 1/2\"\" flat iron, both in order not to damage my hair, but also as the larger size of this iron is more likely to come in contact with one's ears.The biggest difference between this and more expensive irons is how smoothly they glide through the hair.  This one pulls a bit, Keratin notwithstanding.  On the other hand, the function of a flat iron is to get your hair smooth, and this definitely does the trick.  A good budget option for hair straightening and smoothing.\"", "This is a great straightener. It's lightweight and easy to use. My hair is fairly straight to begin with, I just use a straightener to iron out the few waves that I have. This straightener does the job well and seems to be keeping my hair in good shape while doing it.", "This is a very good Hair straightener,it does the job well and has several different heat levels. It has a nice feel in your hands its not too big, or small-love the swivle cord it also heats up incredibly fast and gets really, really hot. I cant say much for the keratin therapy since I have not been using it very long all in all good value for the price.", "The Remington Straightener fits well in the hand and runs though thick long hair well.  (My daughter uses this product)  However, the smart sensor doesn't seem entirely accurate as I've noticed frizzed sections of hair which happen when the temperature of the straightener is too high.  This is happening to the new growth hair which tends to be finer and more fragile along the temples, for example.On the other hand, this is an inexpensive straightener and to expect it to work as well as one twice its price is probably unreasonable.  The straightener has lasted well for several months which is a good sign.  So, with the cliched caveat that you are getting what you are paying for, I recommend this product if this is the amount you want to spend and you are attentive about avoiding new growth hair.  Otherwise, you may want to keep on looking.", "This is a very fine and unique product. I specifically like the features of automatic heat control and the Keratin protein infused plates that provide essential vitamins. Not too pricey either.", "I used to have an expensive straightener, and I liked it pretty well, but it conked out.  This Remington product works at least as well as the more expensive one I've used.  It heats up very quickly and one quick pass on my hair and it's straight.  I really think it makes my hair feel softer too, so I'm assuming it lays down the cuticle well.  There are two things that give me pause that I should mention. First, it is very easy to burn yourself with this rod, as the heat pads are close to the edge.  The second thing is that I think it generally is hotter than I'm used to, so move quickly on your hair so you don't burn it.  Once you get used to it, it's fine, but just a head's up from the first few uses.", "\"As the sad owner of fine, frizzy hair, I'm always looking for a straightener that can tame my unruly locks without damage. I love that this straightener has temperature choices, my favorite being 340 degrees. My hair gets straightened and stays that way, even when the air is humid. Afterward, I'll often use electric curlers to give more body to my hair -- yes, a time-consuming, yet essential step to give me the confidence to be seen in public.The straightener grips well and does not have any edges, nooks or crannies that pull out my hair.The default temperature is 375 degrees, so I have to remember to dial it down to the next lower setting, which is 340 degrees. It can be set as low as 300 or as high as 450, but I can't imagine whose hair could withstand that temperature. As the iron is heating, the blue temperature setting blinks until the desired temperature is reached.As with every straightener I've ever owned, there is a tendency for the iron to tip over on its side, so I've discovered a fabulous \"\"stand\"\" for it -- just a cheap metal napkin holder that I got from Target. (Please see the photo above.) It protects my bathroom counter top from the heat.This is the first straightener I've had with an on-off switch and I have to remember to press the button. (Not a product flaw, but a character flaw.) No worries, though, since it heats up to the desired temperature in seconds.\"", "Left my hair shiny and soft. I like this straightener, it did the trick without damaging my hair too much. It is not overly expensive, so I would say to try this one before you go and buy a CHI or an expensive salon one. It worked well for my frizzy curly hair, so I would try this one first.", "I have only used the larger straighteners. After noticing how often my stylists were using a small one, I felt the need to try one myself. This Remington S8590 heated up in the same amount of time as its larger counterparts. It fit nicely in my hand and was a cinch to use.I am unsure about the 'damage sensor'. I didn't notice it working for me, so hopefully it means my damage is minimal to not an issue. I was pleased with the swivel cord, that kept me from doing that cord dance when you are forced to twist and turn and pivot to avoid tangling up in the cord.Lastly, I was happy to see a 60 min cut off. Its important to me to have these built in safety features.", "\"This is my third, over the years, and perhaps the best.For a guy, one needs this size or smaller for most cuts.  I can style the hair in about 2 minutes, and keep the frizz and wavy stuff away all day.As with all flat irons of this size, one needs to learn how to use it, to avoid a 1960's \"\"Troll Doll\"\" effect  ( not understanding that? Look it up! LOL). We can not ALL look like the star of the original \"\"Footloose\"\" with ease.On the road, this will fix being out in the rain, or high humidity events, and get you looking polished.In the past 5 years or so, I have seen more Remington flat irons on TV and film sets than any other brand, which is telling.This unit has a smart sensor to reduce heat if you over process the hair ( probably not an issue for guys, but might be for gal's with longer hair).The packaging is high-end, and the addition of Keratin in a flat iron is welcome, if one has frizzy hair.As with other Remington's - a flat iron is multi-use for guys.  Press those pants, and shirts on the road, and a tablecloth for a family celebration!Great item!\"", "Sometimes my hair looks like Bozo the clowns so I need to calm it down before going out in public. This is a pretty good straightener for that. It straightens great the only problem I have is the iron won't go thru my hair as easy as I would like I have to put power behind it and if I am in a hurry which I usually am I get upset but it def does the job :)", "This straightener is almost perfect. I love the five different heat settings. Love that I can turn off the heat sensor. Love the ceramic plates and the keratin infusion. I love the 30-second warm up and the fact that it will shut itself off after one hour (perfect for those who tend to forget!) I even love the purple lights on the handle-underneath the handle-that shine through, it's very attractive. The only thing I didn't like about this hair straightener from Remington is that the plates are just far enough from the edge to make it impossible to straighten the hairs right at the scalp. Thankfully my hair isn't very curly so it wasn't much of an issue for me, but for those with ultra curly hair, it may pose a problem.", "I got to use this flat iron twice before my son's fiancee borrowed it. She refuses to give it back because she likes it so much!She does have a suggestion for flat iron manufacturers out there...make a 1 1/2 inch iron for people with longer hair so you don't have to keep going over it. She says the 2 inch is too wide and the 1 inch not wide enough.Anyway, the two times I got to use it I really liked it. It smoothed down the natural, thick wave in my hair with no frizz later. We get a lot of rain here and my hair does tend to start frizzing when the humidity gets up there, but this took care of it all day. It's why I wanted it back. LOL. Plus I got to set the temperature for what I needed, not some preset iron. The dial for the temp gauge is in a very awkward place however. If you need to change it be careful or you can get burned.It has been getting use every day for the better part of the year and still going, but other than that I can't comment on how long this product will go until it dies.", "So I love that this adjusts to your hair.  We have all used a flat iron by now.  What I liked about this Remington S8590 model is that it heats up quickly, it turns itself off when not being used.  I also loved that it adjusted the heat level to the damange level of your hair.  It doesn't move through your hair like a ceramic plate does, but I am willing to trade off this glide for a flat iron that will keep my hair healthy.", "My daughter is a stylist and helped me out by trying this on a few test subjects and offered her thoughts.Very nice first impression, with a nice handle feel (slight taper) and pleasant techie looking backlighting in the handle.  Heatup is quick, advertised at 30 seconds and seems to hold up to that promise.  Five settings.  This straighter will get HOT, up to 450 degrees.  Has a sensor to lower temp when damaged hair is detected. (Sorry, I can't report on any damaged hair subjects as we didn't have any).Nice decently smooth glide while straightening, typical of ceramic plate straighteners.  OK experience here.  The keratin infusion strip in the device is purported to have a four year life, which equals the remarkably generous warranty on this tool.  Opinion is that the keratin treatment does tend to enhance silkinesss.If you forget to unplug it . . . auto shutoff in 60 minutes.In summary - this seems to be one of the better high end consumer targeted straighteners.  Keratin treament is controversial.  If you want to pursue it, this is a very convenient and seemingly safe method.  Results seem very favorable after our short trial run on a few subjects with generally undamaged hair.", "\"I love Remington products, so I was expecting good things from this item, and I wasn't disappointed. Having fine hair, I have to be careful when using heat for anything (rollers, irons, dryers, etc), but I'm usually in a rush, and I don't pay attention to the settings the way I should. This smart sensor takes away the idiot factor.Not sure I see a difference with the \"\"keratin therapy,\"\" but I've only been using it for about a week. In any case, I love the results so far.\"", "The Remington Keratin Therapy Straightener does a very nice job of smoothing hair. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. The plates use keratin technology to infuse the hair gently and protect it. Very pleased with this one. Would definitely recommend it. It's gentle on the hair, too.", "\"I like this straightener. It is much better than the discount store/drugstore ones I've tried. It gets very hot and the plates don't damage my hair.However, I have a different Remington model straightener that I like better. This one is sleek but not quite as heavy. The button placement is better on this one than the other one. The buttons are on the side and out of the way on this one. On my other Remington one the buttons are so conveniently-placed on the outside that it's hard not to push them by mistake. However that one has a button-lock feature.This one has a strip down the center of one of the plates that's supposed to sense the hair and automatically adjust the temperature to make sure it's not too hot.I admit I don't begin to understand the technology behind this appliance and I don't know if it is really \"\"infused\"\" with conditioners or not. But I do know it works well and does not damage my hair like some other ones I've used.The sides are a little sharper-edged than I'd like. I prefer sides that are slightly rounded.Overall, a great product and I would recommend it.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04117361828684807, 0.0462506078183651, 0.03990602865815163, 0.043322380632162094, 0.036451857537031174, 0.04069223254919052, 0.03962375223636627, 0.03798011317849159, 0.03719151392579079, 0.039810117334127426, 0.03519690781831741, 0.035583797842264175, 0.03956054896116257, 0.04117491468787193, 0.034754589200019836, 0.03895902261137962, 0.03586645796895027, 0.03827188163995743, 0.041065763682127, 0.04231046512722969, 0.03261013701558113, 0.03885344788432121, 0.027535730972886086, 0.03804341331124306, 0.04229695349931717, 0.03551378846168518]]}
