The best part of the hardware for me is the dual analog sticks. These are a major bonus since fpss basically require them nowadays. Not only are there two of them, they are also of excellent quality. One of the things I always disliked about the PSP was the analog stick that was flat to the surface and rather difficult to use. The 3DS has copied this design, although they made it more ergonomically comfortable. The Vita however, has two that stick out from the system, just like on the PS3 remote, allowing much greater control and ease of movement. There are sensitivity issues since the sticks are smaller than their PS3 equivalents, but once you adapt to it the controls are almost as easy to use.The second best thing about the Vita is the OLED touchscreen. This touchscreen is absolutely beautiful and has excellent resolution. I thought the touchscreen aspect was just a gimmick, but some of the games have made excellent use of it allowing them to compensate for not having back bumpers (L2/R2 buttons). Well, technically they do have those in the rear touchpad, but it is so touchy and difficult to use that it might as well not exist. The big plus of this touchscreen is that it is much more sensitive and reliable than the 3DS's. You can type with fair accuracy using only your finger, and responses on one section of the screen rarely result in unexpected reactions from another. It does tend to make the screen oily, but that's the price you pay for all touchscreens.The graphics on the system are amazing, although all that talk of them being almost as good as the PS3 is garbage. They fit comfortably between the PS2 and PS3 level of graphics, with the result probably being a bit closer to the Wii than the PS3. With the smaller screen it is easier to hide bad texture maps and glitches. That doesn't take anything away from the system. On the small screen those graphics look amazing. I'm not sure where these graphics fit when compared to the 3DS, but they are definitely an improvement. It's hard to think of any 3DS games with high graphical requirements since they tend to aim for cartoony and exaggerated worlds, but I can't remember any that even come close to pulling off Uncharted: Golden Abyss. At a guess, I'd say that the 3DS reproduces approximately the same graphics as a PS2 (as can be seen by their virtually unchanged ports of PS2 games) while the Vita is a bit higher (as seen by their improved ports of PS2 games). The difference is more one of style than capability, with Sony focusing on realistic games that show off their graphics engine while Nintendo does what they usually do and try to create fun, cartoony games. The graphics leap between the 3DS and the Vita just isn't that high. Certainly not enough to recommend getting a Vita on that score alone. The biggest advantage they have graphically is that their screen is just better quality, and doesn't waste energy on 3D that nobody uses.I've heard some complaints about battery life but I don't know what all the fuss is about. My Vita plays for about five hours without recharging, which is a good hour or two longer than my 3DS does. I appreciate that the older systems lasted longer but that was because they had less graphics-intensive games. You can still play those games so it isn't a problem. A DS game on the 3DS can last all day, and playing a PSP game on the Vita is likewise. The Vita also has an excellent sleep mode. I found that the system drains far less quickly when asleep than the 3DS does. Besides, it was really only the DS generation of games that worked like that. Previous systems often had terrible battery life (see the two-hour long Game Gear).The layout of the Vita is basically that of a Playstation controller with a big screen in the middle. The two analog sticks are in the proper places and are reasonably sensitive. The PS button has been moved to the left corner and glows when the game is on. The start and select buttons have become a bit crummy since you have to push at quite a difficult angle to get them to go down. The two bumper bars are very responsive, and look quite stylish. The rear touchpad is useless. Comfort-wise the system is very nice, fitting neatly into your hand with some nice pads at the back to support your grip. The system is somewhat heavy, but that's never been a problem for me. The game does suffer dramatically in portability when compared to its competition. Not only is it larger than the 3DS-XL (or the PSP for that matter), it is also bumpier and less protected. With no DS clamshell front to protect it the Vita's screen is dangerously exposed to sharp knocks. I can also assure you that the two analog sticks, despite making gameplay amazing, mean that the Vita will never comfortably fit into anyone's pocket. There are cases for it that will alleviate the protection issue, but the best that you can do is carry it in your jacket. And for some people that just isn't enough. It all depends how you use it.Software-wise the Vita comes preinstalled with some basic programs of varied utility. The main screen is an ugly series of icons accessed by the touchscreen. Sony is trying to make their system into a phone and I don't understand why. Still, it functions well enough. The browser still sucks and the maps app isn't particularly helpful. Due to the presence of a touchscreen the messages app has become functional. The PSN is extremely useful. In terms of new software the main addition is Near. It's trying to do what Streetpass does, but it does it badly. All you can do with it is see what people in your city are playing. It connects through 3G so it bases its records of local Vita users on the last location they signed in on. No, it doesn't continue to sync with other devices when you put it on sleep mode. That'd just be silly. It isn't like the 3DS which communicates with other consoles via wifi.Hardware-wise the only major problem is the proprietary memory cards, which are so obviously money-grabbing as to be insulting. Especially given the Vita's emphasis on downloadable content this is just a kick in the teeth for gamers. After all, some of their games aren't even available in physical copies. And if you want to download any PS1 or PSP games (which look amazing on the new screen btw) then you're equally screwed. Worst of all, since there is no internal memory you need to buy one of these cards to play any game, whether or not you intend to download games. And a good card can cost half as much as the system itself. It's disgraceful.Another silly feature is the 3G option. There's no point to having this since there aren't many online games for the Vita, and most of the other internet functions will require you to connect to a more reliable wifi hub anyway. 3G is expensive and difficult to arrange with your local provider. Maybe this isn't the case in Japan, but it is in the US. And of course, even if you get service it isn't going to be as good as wifi anyway. Besides, what's the point of playing online games outside anyway? When you're in public you can't exactly shout into your mic to inform your teammates that they're being morons. Not that you could do that anyway since the Vita only supports 3G for turn-based combat and Near. Any first-person shooters will have to find some wifi. 3G also drains your battery in a heartbeat. Unless you live in an area that has no broadband internet connection but still gets 3G I can't see the point of it.To be perfectly honest, even this isn't enough to prevent people from buying the system. What might serve as more of a deterrent is the games catalog. The Vita has been out for two years but is still suffering from a lack of truly great games. The best new games to come out thus far areUncharted: Golden AbyssandAssassin's Creed III: Liberation. They also gave Persona 4 an awesome port calledPersona 4: Golden. All of these games came out in the first year, when enthusiasm for the new system was still fresh. There has been little since. The 3DS was suffering from this too until fairly recently, with the most popular games being ports from older systems likeThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Tales of the Abyss, andStar Fox 64. Now the 3DS is picking up steam withFire Emblem: Awakening,Pok&eacute;mon X and Y,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, andShin Megami Tensei IV, but the Vita seems stalled.One of the major pluses of the system though is its easy access to the PSN. A gigantic library of PS1 and PSP games are available for download. Yes, these were available before, but only for the PSP. Now you can access them on the Vita's high def screen and use dual analog sticks for control. This can be really helpful even on PSP games that have replaced the right analog stick with the top bumpers. There are also demos and free content that adds greatly to the experience. Much better than Nintendo's eShop. Or maybe that's just the opinion of someone used to the PSN. Like the PS3 games are region-free, though DLC is region locked. You can also have only one account connected to your Vita which means no more copying games from different accounts. You have to reformat the card every time you change.To sum up: I really like the Vita. On a strictly hardware level the Vita is clearly superior to its closest competitor (the 3DS), even if that system has advantages when it comes to portability and convenience. Its biggest problem is the lack of good games, and that's hardly the fault of the hardware. Like the 3DS it's had a slow start, but hopefully it will pick up now that the price has gone down and a new and cheaper model has been released. PS4 functionality should also help them. If you're willing to bet on future successes then this system is well worth it and the backlog of PS1/PSP games should keep you occupied for quite a while. If you're waiting for that one brilliant game that makes the system worth buying... it hasn't come yet. But hopefully it will soon. If you are planning on buying this system though go for the wifi only version unless you can find this one cheaper. 3G support offers nothing.", "Overall, the Vita is a well done portable gaming system.  I used the PSP for a while, and the DS, GameBoys, etc...I have always been a fan of the portable gaming market.  I had pretty high expectations for this as Sony really talked this up.Overall, I am pretty happy with getting it.  The graphics are a large improvement, and the gameplay finally feels full fledges as opposed to the portable version where generally you lose most of the features of the console version.  You still see that at times on the Vita, but I'm sure as time goes on that will only get better and better.If you play portable games a lot, you will probably enjoy it.", "\"As others have stated, this \"\"bundle\"\" forces you to pay *extra* just to access the bonus content it promises. You get the $15 PSN card and an *extra* AT&T; pass...all with the purchase of an AT&T; Pass data plan. You don't actually get a free AT&T; Pass with the bundle, you get one extra in addition to the purchase of one. There is no way around this, meaning that if you want those things, at least $20 is necessary for the absolute cheapest plan available. Further, the bonuses aren't accepted until *30 days* have passed upon redeeming it. Nothing else needs to be said about that.What you're really getting is the Wi-Fi/3G model with an 8 gig card, with \"\"bonuses\"\" that are not bonuses at all, but require you to sink extra money in just to access. That's just unacceptable, and if I had known this, I would have stuck with my original plan of just getting the Wi-Fi and an 8 gig card and saved myself $20.As for the system itself, I have to say it's so far been very impressive. The graphics power, especially for first generation games, is phenomenal, and the touch screen works better than expected. I could have totally done without gyroscopic sensitivity and a rear touchpad, though. These seem like things that were just never necessary and so far have no real practical purpose. Sure, they do things in games, but it's nothing you can't do with the controller itself with more accuracy. It'll take some time to see if these features are worth it at all, but right now they just seem kind of meaningless. Do we really need gyroscopic sensitivity on a handheld system? I personally don't think so, not until they're more than ridiculous tacked-on ideas to throw into games just to muck up the action.The overall feel of the system is especially nice for an initial launch version. It's surprisingly slim, the buttons feel right, and it just feels good to hold and use. I would have preferred a switch to turn on Flight Mode instead of being forced to go into settings to activate or deactivate it, like the original PSP has. This switch, being a major battery saver, is sort of important when you want to turn it on, then off, and then on again, but this forces you to \"\"minimize\"\" the game and go into settings to turn it on or off. Luckily, the option isn't buried, so you can do it fairly quickly with one switch in the settings menu, which can be easily made into a shortcut on the desktop interface.I can live with the new Vita-only memory cards in lieu of standard M2 cards the PSP used, as that system caused rampant piracy of PSP games that were extremely easily hacked and turned into ISO files to distribute and use for free. The PSP was murdered by the incredible ease of pirating software and games and custom firmware due to the M2 cards and lack of cracking security in the official firmwares. So it's understandable that the cards are now Vita-specific, and are luckily not too unreasonable in price. $30 for 8 gigs isn't bad and gets the job done, but it's not quite the $20 I paid for a bulk-packaged 16 gig M2 card for my PSP Slim.Following the trend of virtually every handheld system, the brightness on the system screen is somewhat lacking, even at max. The original DS and PSP both had this problem, too. While the Vita definitely is far less noticeable than the original DS or PSP, it still isn't quite as bright as I'd like at its maximum setting. But considering that this thing eats its battery alive already, you probably won't even be playing on max brightness now, anyway.The cross-compatibility many games have with the PS3 and PSP with the Vita is a very nice touch. You can instantly upload or download your save file, for instance, in BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND. One press of either and you start right where you left off, no matter which system you're accessing the file on. Downloaded PSP games are playable on the Vita, but obviously, discs aren't, which is very unfortunate, but of course understandable. If you've still got PSP games to play, don't sell the system quite yet. But Sony is offering a mutual relationship with us to allow downloaded PSP games to play on the Vita; Sony gets to keep those on their Store, and we get access to them as downloads. We can't ask for more, really.So, here's the bottom line: The bundle is crap, and extremely misleading, but the system itself is certainly competent for an initial launch, far more impressive than the disaster of a system and launch games the 3DS brought us. The 3DS remains a highly questionable system with its less-than-ideal 3D system and lack of graphics power or innovation, and still seems like little more than a somewhat more powerful DS Lite with 3D thrown in. The Vita manages to avoid any major pitfalls that many were concerned about, and the battery life, assuming you don't keep everything on all at once at full blast, lasts long enough to be tolerable. The OLED screen definitely helps in this regard, requiring far less power than a standard LCD screen to display a picture. Everything seems to work pretty well, and I have no major complaints. The potential is definitely here, and if the now-purposeless gyroscopic sensitivity and rear touchscreen are used well in the future, this system might be something really special. For the moment, it's still a great system, and worth it for those who are interested in it.Just know that the \"\"bundle\"\" is not a bundle at all, and take the system for what it is, and you should be content. But avoid this bundle, because what seems like an ideal buying solution (everyone's going to spend at least $280 for the Wi-Fi and memory card, anyway, so what's another $20 for this much more stuff you're supposed to get?) is actually not even a bundle until you pay extra. There is no free Pass, and no free PSN card at all until you pay for one in the first place, which isn't chump change.\"", "I enjoy my PS Vita more than I do playing my wife's 3DS.  Which is surprising becasue I didn't really enjoy all that much the PSP when it was sitll around.Now I am hoping that some of the PSP games are re-released physically as I would love to play some of those gems on the PS Vita's better control, media managment, and connectivity with the internet and stauts updates to facebook and such when you complete trophies.", "You can read all of the specs yourself, but I am really impressed with how the Vita turned out. Here is the gist of my overall experience:Unboxing: Great layout, easy to access everything. 8GB memory card comes in the retail packaging, which is great for reselling it (I purchased a 32 GB card so didn't need it). I was able to get $25 on Craigslist for it, so that's a winner. The easy start guide unfolds nicely, everything is packed well. Warning: there are instructions for putting in the SIM card. I freaked out for a bit because I could not find it, but apparently some of them come with the SIM preloaded.Startup: This was easily the most frustrating part of the experience. When prompted to set up the data plan initially, the browser was so slow and crashed so much that I couldn't do it, so I decided to just wait and do it through the AT&T; setup app. Then it asked for my PSN info. I put that I already had an account, but then it wouldn't take it because there was a software update required. There was no way to get to where you update the software though without putting in a PSN account. So kind of a vicious cycle. Finally I had to create a trial PSN account, run a software update, then put in my real PSN account. So I kind of got the runaround on that. After I finally got it working and updated, everything worked like a charm. So I would say wait and just breeze through the inital setup and get the software updated, otherwise it just gets really frustrating.Features: Twitter, Netflix and Facebook on day one, really pumped about this. The OS runs like a dream and is really intuitive, but I'm not a fan of the appearance. Everything is smooth and quick. No real gripes at all. I like how games stay on your home page even if the card isn't loaded in the system. Maps works great, better than on my iPhone 4. Near, Party and Chat seems like they should have all been combined into one app, but the features are great individually.AT&T;: I live in downtown Dallas, and service is great here. No complaints there. The data speed after the software update was much, much better than before as well, and the browser more stable. You get a month free after you pay for a month, which has been well disclosed, but I am disappointed that you have to wait 30 days for the game. From all accounts that game will be SuperStardust Delta, which I'm excited about considering the positive reviews its gotten.Gameplay: I have really only spent quality time with FIFA because of the setup frustration, but it looks and plays great. Graphics are on par with the PS3, and the control scheme is identical. I know a lot of people really don't like some of the rear touchpad implementations, but luckily you can turn that off in pretty much all games if you don't like it. I'm a fan though.Battery life: Pretty good thus far. With the amount of downloads and gameplay usage I've done I've got about 50% battery left after 2.5 hours of use. Looks like the 5 hour quote is pretty accurate.All in all its a great system. You can't go wrong getting one. I have less complaints about this system than any other launch item I've bought. The game selection is great, really good first and third party support, and a finished product at launch from all that I've seen. Kudos to Sony and the PS team for a job well done.", "Okay I picked up a Vita as my PS4 Companion, I have been talking about getting one for years but with the Gamestop 50% more trade in credit this week I just pawned off a ton of my PS3 games and decided to pick one up.First OffThis is a very impressive hand held system, completely blows away any other hand held in the market. the graphics are insanely good and the controls are amazing. Mix that with Netflix and Hulu on board and I am in heaven. except a couple things that make me wonder what the hell Sony was thinking.You can not deny it when you first turn it on and load up your first game ( KillZone mercenary ) And it looks just as good as your PS3 and handles just as well also. This is a solid system that has been over shadowed by less worthy hand held systems. Then you head over and link it up to your PS4 as a second screen to get some game time (Second Son ) in your front room while the PS4 is in the bedroom. heavy solid built and worth every penny.Buy my problem is that we have 2 people who use the PSN account in my house ( guessing some people have more ) and you find out that in order to let two people use a PSV ( each on their own account ) you have to have 2 memory cards. each memory card is tied to an account and this is just part of the problem.If you could use a standard SD card like every other device on the market this would be easy. but instead you are locked into a proprietary Sony SD card and the prices are insane for these cards. A 4GB card will only hold at most 2 small games since each game runs in the MB's I mean come on the graphics are AMAZING.I would need at least a 32 GB card and that will cost you around $65-$75+ especially since I am a PS Plus member and look forward to my free monthly games which are digital downloads and will eat up space on the memory card. you can run down to any wall-mart or even Walgreen and pick up a standard 32 GB SD card for about $20-$25 these days. so the markup on the Sony card is just insane !It is simply a defense tactic ( from piracy )  that should have never happened from Sony. I get you want it tied down so people can not copy the games but there are much better ways as far as ( coding the OS ) is concerned to accomplish this without making people regret the purchase.Don't get me wrong I love the PSV so far and am very glad I decided to get one, but I regret not reading more about the memory card issue before I purchased it now.On top of this why make it so insanely difficult for your core customers ? The PSN account is a monthly & annual revenue stream if people decided to purchase a subscription from you they are dedicated to your system. Sony is pretty much making it hard for the people who actually support them. This is one of the most asinine decisions I have seen and seems more like a Microsoft or Apple move and I just can not figure out why they would do it without realizing the consequences of it actually pushing more customers away than anything else.User experience is just as important as anything else in a gaming market. and if people feel they are locked out or not able to use a system the way it was intended then that is a problem and seems more like a ( Ouya ) move.", "My 10 yr old son lost the 1st Vita on return trip from Lousyana in January. That was a Christmas gift. My normal rule is &#34;I buy once.&#34; Made an exception here because I felt partially responsible, like if I had questioned him more during the return flight he would have kept up with it. So, I broke down and spent yet another $200+ to retrofit him for his February birthday. The look on his face and teary-eyed hug I got assuaged the ache in my wallet - almost. Anyway, he loves it and is far more careful now. The huge screen and graphics are clear and amazing. Suggest, among other accessories, getting a grip for it to add in comfort while also serving as a protective shield for inevitable drops.  Connects to my home internet flawlessly via my Apple Airport router, another fantastic buy. Still can't believe I spent over $500 for a 10 yr old's hand-held game,...long way from the days of Major Matt Mason.", "\"This console is top notch.  The system seems to keep evolving as time goes on.  There are a lot of AAA+ titles for it now, so it's well past the launch stage, and these games are EXCELLENT.  I find myself playing the Vita almost as much as my PS4.  And now with remote view and second screen capability, the Vita is even more a must-have when you go next-gen with the PS4.  You can actually play your PS4 through the Vita while someone else is watching the TV, if you need to.  Awesome!I appreciate that the controls are better suited for adult hands; mores than the PSP, which I had to sell because the controls were too small and it hurt my hands.  Yet now you can play old PSP games (and some PS3 games) on the Vita, too!  The rear touchpad is truly an innovation and works very precisely (Tearawayis a stellar game for this, in particular, but it also provides extra buttons when streaming remote play from the PS4, and works surprisingly well).Uncharted: Golden Abyss - PlayStation Vitais awesome (and free with PS+!!!), as well as the Assassin's Creed entry,Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.  There are so many great small studio/indie games, too, as well as the \"\"definitive\"\" editions of many mobile device games (re-written for the Vita, so you get the full spectrum of controls, not only a touchpad)!  Thomas Was Alone is one such game (also a PS+ game as of this writing).  PS+ pays off in dividends, completely.  Also, if you have a previous PSN account, games you purchased in the past can be easily re-downloaded by simply restoring the licenses.PS+ has more than paid for itself, as well; in the first few months I've gotten games on both PS4 and Vita (some of which are cross-platform) for free (and others are discounted when you have PS+!), that I would have paid full-price for, easily.  Sony is providing TOP NOTCH games through PS+, and it feels like a massive gold mine of value compared to all that was previously spent on Xbone Live, which never provided ANYTHING except \"\"access\"\" to play online.  Xbone is gone; MS is liquidating the entire division.  Sony is here to stay, taking us into the next generation of gaming!  It's an awesome time to be a gamer.Lastly, I got the 3G version (I happened upon a PS4/Vita bundle, and that's what it came with), but seeing as Amazon has them for roughly the same price, I recommend getting the 3G/Wi-fi version.  I only use wifi, but some day in the future, if I need 3G, I will have it available, all I have to do is enable it.  And you get a month for free, no terms; that's a great deal.Game on!\"", "I got the bundle and it was a big ripoff. 3g is so useless today so now I just have to look at an att icon everytime i'm on my homepage. Games are mostly good. not many great games. A lot of the games are watered down ps3 ports and $50. cell phone style shooters with resistance and cod slapped on the cover. Also this system has cell phone game ports for too much money such as asphalt which is a 99cent game on phones and tablets and asphalt 8 for 99cents is a better game then the on on the vita. luckily killzone is nice and uncharted is out and that is a great game! Most of the good games are honestly watered down ps3 shovelware. PSP compatibility is cool because you can remap buttons to the analog sticks to get better controls out of shooters. The analog sticks aren't that good. I wish they would've went with dual slide pads instead. they get in the way to when pressing the face buttons. The speakers are average. The system and especially the screen are beautiful! The dpad isn't as good as the usual sony dpad which is the best dpad ever but it's still better then most dpads today. The start and select buttons are flush with the system making them hard to press. the back touch pad is a gimmick. some games overuse the touch screen. The battery life is excellent. i wish the console had tv out but no dice. If you want tv out you need to pay a lot of money for a modded vita from china, or you have to wait for the vita tv console which is gonna play vita games on your tv as well as stream ps4 to different rooms and be a media box. it will do everything the vita does in a console instead of a portable for $100. taking a page from the Ouya. There is no removable battery in the vita so you can't change the battery like in the psp. Memory cards are overpriced and required. I think that's it for now.", "\"I got my 3G/WiFi bundle this morning from my local Gamestop store and have been playing it non-stop! Yes, it came pre-charged. This is the first gadget I've bought that does not require you to \"\"fully charge\"\" the battery before you can use it. Nice. An AC adapter is included. I have not tested whether I can use my PC's USB port. The Vita uses a new interface like today's smartphones (except the innovative Windows Phone's Metro interface) whereby you scroll through pages of icons to choose what you want to launch. The quick start guide is helpful, but if you need more info you'll have to use an ugly online guide just like the ones for the PS3 and PSP! Why can't Sony use PDF? And why can't they use an industry-standard memory storage format? The OLED screen is not as impressive as some reviews claim; it's okay, on par with the Super LCD screen on my HTC Windows Phone, but I think Super LCD is still a bit better as its image rendering is easier on the eyes. The Vita is big and bulky but surprisingly not heavy and actually feels good in the hands! Still, it's too bulky to look good. I have downloaded a few free games from PSN but have not bought any real, expensive card-based games yet. So far I like the Vita but am not too crazy about it. I think it's got potentials. Yes, the 3G version has an 8GB memory card. I would have bought the WiFi-only version but my store didn't have that one in stock.\"", "Wow, playing Uncharted Golden Abyss, forget about it this is the best hand held gaming device, or portable gaming device on the planet. The ONLY possible short coming is the battery life which is noticeable because you play it so long you kill the battery, you play it so long because it is a kick A** device. The Android OS is a decent iOS knock off, but you get real gaming with physical controls and dual analog sticks... add in the dual touch screens and the developers haven't even begun unleashing the full potential of this beast system. Golden Abyss is just incredible, I've beaten all 3 canon Uncharted games on crushing so I know what's going on, this game is more exploration and less shooting but in many ways it's as good or better than the PS3 versions.I also bought the 32GB card, to get the max out of this beautiful system and it's worth it... comparing the $250 plus additional 16GB i paid for the PSPGO I spent about the same amount but the Vita is just literally 10 times the system in every way. YOu can download games, apps, movies directly to the system independent of using a PS3 like you had to do on the PSP since it was wireless b only and you couldn't download anything other than a theme without it crashing. With the 32GB card I have all my PSP digital games, tons of music, 3 movies and still have room for a bit more.I will be disgusted if people don't rally to support this system, and even more disgusted if developers don't start supporting it with top tier efforts like RE for Vita, Silent Hill etc... this system deserves the best from developers because it can DO IT ALL, graphics, download content, the sound is great etc... not to mention the limitless potential for control schemes.Escape Plan is also good, I beat it already as for the main story... it has some technical control issues, Hot Shots Golf is also amazing, the graphics are sharp and it's as good as the PS3 version. YOu can choose between various power input interface for shots which has never been done so conclusively in any other HSG game.BUY THIS SYSTEM and bring it to life before it dies.", "It is apparent to me that Sony has taken a lot of notes from Apple's Ipod Touch, and other Apple products in general. This is not always for the best, however. The first negative aspect I encountered was with the navigating the menus. You cannot use any buttons. It is all touch-screen and the PS Button (sound familiar?). Secondly, the features in the video player. You have to tap the screen to make a 4:3 video full-screen, and it only zooms into the video and not stretch it (same with the Ipod Touch). The problem here is that the Ipod Touch has a 3:2 Aspect Ratio and zooming into a 4:3 video would not cut off HALF the video.Why would they remove great features that the PSP and PS3 had, instead of adding onto it? It's simply idiotic. Sony wants to be the new Apple, and by making an Ipod Touch with the addition of a PS3 controller's inputs they think they can succeed. The problem with this is that the console is made out of crappy plastic and is super fragile, unlike Apple's stuff.The analog sticks aren't precise and are terrible with FPS in my experience. Also, while playing Uncharted, I felt like I moving the analog sticks up to go down and down to go up because of how awkward it is to grip the handheld and use the analog sticks. This can be remedied with a grip attachment, though.With the newest update, the PS Button's blue light has been turned on at all times. I think they did this to remedy the fact that people probably couldn't figure out how to get out of sleep-mode and other situations, since all the other buttons don't work out of game.Similarities to the Ipod Touch: 1. Only the power button, volume buttons, and touch-screen work out-of-game. 2. Tapping the power button goes into a lock-screen and holding it pops up the option to shut down or cancel, which you have to choose using the touch-screen. 3. The USB cable is the only charging cable. 4. Video player can only do what the Ipod can do. 5. Menus are laid out the same way. 6. More stuff. I don't even care to list anymore stuff since it might give some readers heart attacks.Edit: Oh yeah and how could I forget the Content Manager. 10x worse than iTunes. Also when cropping larger images to be used as a background or start menu screen, the edges become jagged. You will have to use a program like Photoshop to crop your images beforehand unless you like looking at crap (well you already are, so not like the extra crap will make a difference.)", "This was a great price (got it on sale) for the PS Vita 3g version, but At&T; are complete (fill in the blanks) and want way too much money for 3g service.  In fact AT&T; needs some great competition to help them calm down.To be honest, the Vita does not feel like there is a plan to keep games coming, but there have been some AAA title announcements and there will be integration with the new PS4.", "Vita is such a wonderful hardware, plus it already has most number of games for new launch console. Plus the movies and music via the Playstation Store, Netflix, etc. Other reviewers already talked about how great the Vita is, let me point out other aspects of the Vita.-Memory : People complain that the memory cards are expense. Yes it is. But Apple charges $100 more if want to step up from 16GB to 32GB iPad. Besides, Vita bundles include 8GB memory cards(which is what most people need anyway), also the price of 32GB Vita memory card is coming down.-Price : Some people say the Vita is a bit expensive. But think about all the cutting edge technology in the Vita with OLED screen and Quad Core processor just to mention a few. A similar smart phone or iPhone would be $500 to $700 if you got it without a contract from major wireless carriers. If you get a smartphone with service contract, you spend hundreds of dollars over a year.-Real games : People say portable gaming consoles are dying because of smart phones and tablets. You can't really play games on these devices with touch screens and gyro sensors, you need controllers like the Vita to really play the games unless you want to play only Angry Birds.-Fast web browser : By the way, did you know the Vita has a web browser? It is much better than the PSP's broswer which used to be slow and ran out of memory. The Vita's browser is faster(thanks to fast processor) and plenty of memory, it really is a usable web browser.-Great selection of movies, music, content : Besides gaming, the Vita has old and latest movies and TV shows (to buy and rent) and any music you want to listen. Music Unlimited is surprising good, you can listen to any music, old and new, for $10 a month.I really enjoy using the Vita, I highly recommend it.", "The Vita... hasn't had a perfect run, not unlike the 3DS's early goings. But it has forged a quirky new identity as a high quality purveyor of ports, emulators, JRPGs, and media. Yes, a large percentage of the Vita's library is on other consoles, but it hardly disqualifies the Vita, since content is content, and, hey, you probably didn't get to play these games before, and it's a cost-effective way to play PSone and PSP titles. Some of the ports are rather excellent remasters, like the system defining Persona 4 Golden. Between that and Persona 3 Portable on PSN, you will hardly put the thing down. What's more, it acts as an effective companion to the PS3 or PS4, not so much in remote play, but in the shared PS Plus benefits, like the Instant Game Collection, and the games that allow cross-buy and cross-save. If you have the recent PS3 version of Minecraft, for example, the incoming Vita version is yours free, and you can move saves between the two.Now, if you want to play Vita games, but don't need a handheld to compete with your phone/3DS, I recommend buying the incoming Playstation TV Bundle for $140, but remember that not all Vita games will be compatible.", "There's no doubting that the hardware itself is pretty impressive and vastly superior to its competitor. The graphics are top notch and the system feels very comfortable in my hands (also differentiating itself from its competitor). The screen is a nice touch screen and using the online browser with it is pretty navigable. The price is definitely pretty steep considering it's almost as expensive as the 360 console when it first came out. $40 for a game also seems a little expensive.With that, the system has huge potential. Currently after about 8 months after launch, there really isn't much to play. The library is pretty stagnant, but will probably pick up exponentially here soon. I recommend just getting the WiFi version as the 3g cost does not seem worth it at all unless you happen to use the system all the time.", "What more can I say? it has everything you can imagine. Think of it as a psp and a cellphone put together in short...It has the facebook/twitter apps for now and a app store opening next month(or already out), it has a great screen, sound is amazing and the overall games look on the level as PS3(see ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 vita). This is the handheld for everyone and easy to use and also has parental lock. It has the fighting games for adults and the rayman adventure games for the kiddies. In another year or so this will be the handheld even Nintendo will be playing once developers get their games rolling out in a few months(it just launched). There are so many more things to list all I can tell you is buy this if you want something cute and the feel of the might ps3 in  your hands on the go.", "I wasn't too hyped about the vita until I saw the amazing launch line up.  So I caved and bought a 3G wifi launch bundle day one.  Fantastic and elegant system, beautiful and responsive touch screen,  brilliant UI and extremely capable and extremely fast.  It is a brilliant launch for a very promising and wonderful system.  Long Live Vita!", "\"I have bought the 3G/Wifi Vita about 1 month ago, and tried a few games on it. Here are my thoughts and experiences.The PS Vita (\"\"Vee-ta\"\" not \"\"Vai-ta\"\" according to their creators) was first known as the \"\"PSP Vita\"\", but shortened to PS Vita for simplicity. Thus one would expect it to be the evolved version of the PSP.During unboxing, I have to say the packaging is not very impressive. It seems to be made up of mostly medium grade cardboard. Nothing too fancy. In comparison, the Nintendo 3DS box looks more elegant and expensive. This is not important to gamers, but might matter to someone buying a gift.Opening up all the flaps give you a thin and small instruction manual, which seems to be the trend for all things electronic nowadays, the console in a protective pocket, a USB cord, and a charger. It might come with accessories or a game, depending on which bundle you bought.The USB cord's input jack is proprietary to the Vita (unlike the PSP which features a miniUSB jack). This is used to connect the system to the PS3 for file transfer. To charge the system, you connect the USB wire to the charger, which goes to the power socket. The light turns orange during charging just like the PSP. There is no separate power input like the PSP.Taking the system out of the protective pocket, it looks and feels like the PSP. The console is bigger and it feels heavier. It looks sleek and expensive, in contrast to its packaging. In elegant black, it is aesthetically very pleasing.Turning the system on, the OLED screen is very crisp and clear. This is the most impressive part of the Vita. The sound is very clear.The display is also a touch screen, and the back doubles up as a second touch pad. Using both while playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss, I found them to be responsive, even for men with fat fingers like myself.The interface is no longer XMB. You navigate entirely with touch. Each icon looks like a coin suspended on a wall. You touch it to run the program/game, and you can rearrange them.There has been a lot of discussion about the Vita memory card. Yes you need to use the PS Vita memory card to save your games and download PSN/SEN content. Unfortunately, everything you heard is true: only 1 PSN account may be accessed on the Vita at any one time. The system and the memory card in use will be linked to the current account. Also, everything is saved on the memory card, not the internal memory. If you wish to use a different PSN account, you have to reset the system, lose all current settings and use a different memory card. Game saves/media/DLC/downloaded games from a different account would not be accessible.To prepare for the long term, I would recommend the largest capacity card, if you can afford it.One gripe I have is that I did not like the game card slot. It is designed like a SD card slot. You slide the game card in, and close it with the cover that is tethered with a small cord. You really have to use your fingernail to pry the cover open before replacing the game. Most protective cases in the market will need to be unfastened when changing the game.In my experience, the battery runs out of juice with 2 hours of full gameplay. I wish it lasted longer. As the battery is built in, there is no possibility of swapping it for a high capacity cell in the future.3G support is convenient but not a necessity. You can send messages and browse the internet on 3G. But for PSN downloads, the system forces you to have a Wifi connection. I would also suggest playing multiplayer on Wifi.The internet browser is nice if you need to check on something on the go. But I found that java-incorporated websites do not show properly.I have tried transferring games downloaded from the PS3 to the Vita, and media files from the Vita to the PSP via the provided USB cord. It is very fast and easy. Quite impressed there.Game library is limited for now but already a few titles are worth picking up. Typical of Sony, launch titles include major titles like Uncharted and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. Hundreds of PSP titles and Minis on the PSN also run on the Vita.Despite its shortcomings, this is an excellent, powerful handheld.  It feels like a PSP2 and a portable PS3 combined. I strongly recommend it.\"", "The dual analog sticks alone would have been an awesome upgrade from my old PSP. But with added touch screen front/back, trophy support, and PS3 (maybe PS2.9) graphics... it blows away the DS3D or any other handheld. It's a MUST buy for any playstation fan. I did purchase the wifi/3G model.. but after seeing the AT&T; data packages, I could have settled for the wifi only option.The only con is that I kind of prefered the cross-media bar to the touch bubbles that the PS Vita uses.", "I never owned the PSP, to me it just was to big (reminded me of Sega Gamegear). When the Sony PS Go came out all I saw was a huge waste of money, then the Vita came out and I was very interested but decided to wait. I bought a Wii U and realized there were no games out for that console so I sold it and with the funds bought myself this bundle.Right off the bat I loved this little guy, the touch pad was very easy for me to understand and get around the menu's are simple and very straight forward. I bought this bundle because it enables both 3G/Wi-Fi and the 8gb. By the way little disclaimer if you have PSP titles on your PSN account the 8GB gets used real quick, I am purchasing a 32gb memory card for this guy, which I recommend if you has PSP titles and PS Plus account. Its another $80-$100 but worth it.I am a Mac user I have an iPhone, iPad, Macbook pro, and iMac and I love how they are all integrated to be used together with the iCloud and my info is with me everywhere. Now Sony has taken that approach and I believe Microsoft is going the same way. I love that I can back up my info to the PS3, and that the PS Plus and PSN accounts are linked to both devices which makes it much easier for me.I bought the MGS HD Collection, Little Big Planet, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom, and Playstation All-Stars Battle Royal, so far the games are extremely fun to play. I have played a few other vita titles as so far nothing besides the horrible Call of Duty game have disappointed.If your on the fence about this item, you shouldn't be especially with the PS4 around the corner and how Sony plans to implement this system with your PS4 just sounds amazing to me. If this bundle is to much then go with the Wi-Fi model, the 3G alone is not worth it. So stop thinking about purchasing and purchase it already.", "It's been years, probably over a decade since I've last been this excited about buying a new console. My first hand-held gaming console was the SEGA Gamegear, which I still own and still works! I've owned most incarnations of the Gameboy but I never bought a PSP because I was just too poor when it came out and kind of forgot about it later on. When I saw the Vita on the PSN unveiling I couldn't believe how far hand-held gaming has come. The graphics on this thing are sick, it makes the Nintendo 3-DS look like it's 10 years old already. There is so much potential for developers of Vita games, with a six-axis rotation, back and front touchpads, two cameras, and dual analog sticks the possibilities are damn near endless. The whole experience feels very interactive which is a great change since gaming has gotten a little stale in the past few years.I bought the Vita with three games, Wipeout 2048, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and Dynasty Warriors NEXT. I kind of expected the release day titles to be crap, since that's what usually happens, but they're actually amazing! All three games offer unique play styles and incorporate the new Vita controls in their own way. My family probably thought I looked ridiculous when I was tapping the screen like a lunatic while dueling in Dynasty Warriors, but I was loving every second of it. Sure the games can use a little polish, especially with some of the new controls but that will just take time. I've been slacking off at work and using every opportunity to play on my Vita and I honestly feel like I'm a kid again.Set up was a breeze, connecting it to the WiFi is simple, buying stuff off the PS Store is fast and easy and so far I haven't had a single error or problem with my device. The battery life seems fine so far and the power saving options are actually really good. The screen is gorgeous and the layout of the Vita is practical and ergonomic, I was expecting heavy cramps since I have really big hands, but I'm fine so far. My right hand does get a bit painful when playing Wipeout, but that's probably because racing games make me quite tense and I tend to squeeze the buttons just a wee bit too hard. The Vita is incredibly light for its size and even fits in the front pockets of my slacks.Once Sony adds the Playstation One classics to the Vita Operating System I will be a very happy camper. Hell I'll probably stop using my PS3 since the Vita is so much more comfortable and I can take it anywhere. If you're looking to buy a Vita but you're not entirely sure yet, maybe it's best to wait a bit when there are more games and peripherals available. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone who has the money to waste on gadgets, it's way more fun than anything you can play on the iPad or Android and it blows the 3-DS out of the water as far as I'm concerned. Definitely worth the money I spent!", "The Ps Vita and myself have a love/hate relationship. I originally purchased this 3G/Wi-Fi Bundle and within a week I had noticed at certain points while using the system in low lighting the screen would have weird black blotches. Thinking something was wrong I returned this back to Amazon. I then looked up about that issue and it's seems that's a common defect of OLED screens and that they all have it. I then repurchased the Vita and again same issue but since it's natural I dealt with it as it only is effected on the black colors. I beat Uncharted on it and that's pretty much it. Never used the 3G as it's pointless and expensive. Didn't use the Vita for a while after that but I carried it places with me and always check the PSN store to see if new games had come out. Eventually I dropped it and with the disgust following I sold the Vita. Months later the Vita had once again come with something I wanted - Assassins Creed Liberation and on a black friday sale the price was to low for me not to bite. Played the game for a little while but eventually got bored since it had no real ties to the actually main series. From the time I didn't have the console til now games have come out and I've purchased and resold most of them as they were not up to the standards a great system like this should have and at their price points. The Vita is at the same point the Wii U is at and that console just launched, such an empty library. Right now I have Persona 4 Golden and Zero Escape and those both feel like the same game with mostly just story telling not bad but not quite what I want with this console at the moment. Recently a game finally came out I'm interested in but for some reason it's only purchasable from the PSN store and I only have a 4GB memory card that was included and refuse to pay $100 for a memory card. The vita needs more time. That's my final opinion.", "\"The PS Vita is a fantastic handheld:  Sony has a tendency to always go hi-tech and all out when they release new hardware, and the Vita is no different.  This particular console adds the ability to connect to mobile 3G networks using a SIM card (sold separately!).  I'll be honest with you:  with as much Wi-Fi as there is around me, and as much hassle as I get when it comes to trying to manage a mobile data plan, I'll probably never use the 3G feature:  mine came as part of a bundle, with discount, that included an 8GB card I would otherwise have bought separately, so it made better economic sense.  Whether you're dying for 3G or could care less, it makes sense to shop around Amazon for the various bundle deals:  like me, you may find one that suits you.  The rest of the PS Vita is as cutting-edge now as the PSP was when it was released.So what makes a PS Vita so special?CONTROLSEvery piece of the Vita has something to do with interaction:  you not only have dual sticks, shoulder buttons, a D-Pad, the familiar four-button layout and Start/Select/Home, you also have really smooth gyroscopic and accelerometric sensors that let you tip, tilt, and roll the unit to play some games.  The generous front screen is also a touch-screen with slick responsiveness that makes my smartphone jealous.  The back has touch sensors that aren't just for fingertips--Uncharted:  Golden Abyss has a jaw-dropping interactive moment where you hold the back of the PS Vita up to the light to 'read' a faded piece of parchment.  Last, there are digital cameras on both the front and back for taking pictures and video.  All of this can be saved to a memory stick, but the downside is that Sony has changed formats on us again:  old Memory sticks are NOT compatible with the Vita.  The newer storage system is proprietary to the PS Vita.SCREENThe screen is bigger than the PSP and about the same size as the top screen of the super-sized Nintendo 3DS XL.  While it is as sensitive to direct sunlight as your average laptop, it does boast a bright screen in just about any other lighting condition.  Just like the PSP and PS3, there is a menu bar that lets you customize all sorts of settings including brightness and power-saving modes.  Touching the front screen is very smooth, with complicated gestures easily translated by games.FEATURESIn addition to gameplay, the PS Vita offers the same kinds of multimedia features as the PSP:  music and video streaming, including Netflix (which works very well over Wi-Fi).  There is a feature called \"\"Near\"\" that will tell you what friends near to you might be playing, or let you look for a new friend nearby with the same game interests.  GPS is also built in as part of the unit and you can use it to navigate if you wish.  I haven't really used this or the 'LiveArea' that lets you share your gaming details with other people, or the IM feature that lets you message people.  I've been more inclined to use my PlayStation Network / PlayStation Store account to pull down games, including my PSP and PSOne favorites, and play them on a larger, brighter screen.One of the neat things about the interface is the 'peel off' way it's organized:  the home screen has round 'bubble' icons that you can tap to access an application.  Each application has a base page that organizes the basic things you might do, such as 'read the manual', 'check for updates', or the most-often-used, 'launch the game' and its corner sticks up like a curled piece of paper.  If you're in-game and press the home button, the game is suspended and you're dropped back to this screen.  Closing the home screen is as simple as using your finger to peel that corner down, like turning the page of a book:  the application is closed and you are back at the 'bubble' icon home screen.  The PS Vita has a built-in browser, and mostly I use it for accessing features off the base page, such as 'Help' or 'Support'.The way accessories are designed now follows the 'USB cable' design:  your PS Vita will have a charger plug, a tiny power box it plugs into, and from there a USB cable leads from the charger to the PS Vita.  The connector on the Vita is also proprietary, and that means that whether you're using an AC adapter, a car charger, or just connecting to a computer, you can't do it without that proprietary connector-to-USB cable.If there's a drawback to the PS Vita, it's that the high price sticker reminds us that this isn't a kids' console.  The unit is large and unwieldy.  It feels fragile and because it's expensive one of the first things you'll want to do is pick up a good protective case for it.  You won't be able to stick it in the average pocket and you'll definitely not want to leave expensive hardware like this lying around or it'll grow legs.  If you have the money though you won't be disappointed in this hi-tech handheld:  it is top-drawer gaming technology at its best.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0019760713912546635, 0.15143810212612152, 0.004738375544548035, 0.057701755315065384, 0.048331499099731445, 0.0010118515929207206, 0.011140795424580574, 0.0055030412040650845, 0.004207898862659931, 0.007226719055324793, 0.04949764534831047, 0.18650048971176147, 0.09055032581090927, 0.040550347417593, 0.009557762183248997, 0.04683356359601021, 0.11820705235004425, 0.004761629272252321, 0.01329262088984251, 0.057238489389419556, 0.0020841360092163086, 0.004940892104059458, 0.028441328555345535, 0.054267581552267075]]}
