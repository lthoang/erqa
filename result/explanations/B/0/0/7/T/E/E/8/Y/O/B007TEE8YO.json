It replaced a 40\"\" Samsung flat panel LED.  While the delivery took longer than expected, once the set arrived, it was uncrated and set-up quickly.  A neighbor and I set the various options I wanted in less than 25 minutes.  So, it is easy toprogram.What's the TV like?  Superb.  The picture quality is amazing.  I hooked it up to a Samsung home theater system with rear wireless speakers and blu-ray, 3D.  I could not ask for a better picture and sound.  For the price, about $1,000 less than a comparable Samsung or LG, this set is a real bargain.Just a few things for anyone considering the Vizio.  3D is very good.  Have tried several 3D discs like Avatar and the experience is impressive.  The four HDMI plugs are more than necessary, but they may be welcome to folks who route many different things through their TVs.  Remote is slow, and the slide out keyboard nice, but made for small hands.  However, because I have the unit linked to Xfinity cable, I have to use the Comcast remote.  I may consider buying a universal remote in the future.I highly recommend this TV to most people.  Why do I say most people.  For the advanced tech savvy people who want every conceivable app and gadget, this set may not be very satisfying.  But for the average viewer who wants a sharp, clear, rich in color picture at a reasonable price, the Vizio is the one to buy.  Already the set has updated itself, and the link with the home theater system is a snap, and offers all the flexibility I need touse a few apps.  So, if you are not into advanced tech, gadgets and apps, and want the best TV monitor for viewing and 3D at this time, Vizio is theway to go.\"", "We're fortunate enough to have several TV's, but lacked one in the family room.  After reading all the nice reviews about this set I purchased the last display model available at nearby a Costco at a healthy discount.We weren't interested in 3D at all, only in getting a good picture with Comcast and Bluray.  After getting it attached to the wall mount my friend and I looked at the Comcast 3D menu and found a free program on dinosaurs.  We slipped on the passive glasses and to our surprise...we loved it!  It was awesome!  My wife and her sister-in-law arrived shortly afterwards and they slipped on a pair of the 3D glasses and the next thing you know we were sitting in front of the TV for a couple of hours watching stuff in 3D.Since that time we've watched a few other things in 3D and we have to admit we've mostly enjoyed it.  Would we still purchase a TV specifically for 3D?  Perhaps.  But only if we got this picture quality during normal viewing.  This TV, once adjusted as per other reviews here, has an outstanding picture I've seen on few other LED televisions.I see this set is discontinued and that's a shame.  It is an fantastic TV for the price.  If you can find one I highly recommend it.  I haven't seen the picture on the replacement model so I won't comment on that.  In any case, until you have it set up in your home it's difficult to make a realistic subjective evaluation.", "This TV is very nice. it was easy to set up and the picture quality is just as amazing as a Sony TV.", "We went with this Vizio because it was a great price, and we wanted the passive 3D functionality and the LED power savings.  The video is truly magnificent.  Our only complaint is the sound is poor.  It vibrates and shakes the whole TV when there are explosions, etc -- So we had to get a Vizio sound bar and mount it below.  This did a great job, and picks up the slack nicely.  We don't use any of the built in Apps really, and rarely watch TV or Movies in 3D -- but it's nice to know that we have that ability if we'd like to.", "\"Anything less than perfect HD looks bad on this TV. I suppose most folks will not care too much about this, but I still watch some old shows and movies that are not in HD, and they are almost unwatchable. Of course, I know it won't look as good as HD, but this is just ridiculously bad. I do compare the picture quality of this TV with that of my Samsung LN46A950... a TV with the most perfect picture I have ever seen, SD or HD. Even if I didn't compare it to anything, the SD quality is just obviously bad on the Vizio. Problem is that the 950 doesn't have 3D and is only 46\"\", otherwise I would never think about replacing it. I'm also not pleased with the light bleed and/or screen uniformity and the fact that the sound is not completely in sync with the picture. The audio settings on the TV do not help the sync, they just make it worse. On the upside, it has really great 3D (even though passive and not completely 1080p) and decent HD. I will be returning this TV pronto. I need a TV that does everything well.\"", "Picture is great, no complaints there. Plastic on the tv is brittle, remote feels flimsy. Smart TV interface is clunky with limited options. I like the samsung better. Only connects to internet with hard-line, no wifi, so be sure you have a data drop where you put the tv.", "\"Have had this TV for a few days now and although there are issues you can't beat the price.  I've got two Samsung UN55C8000 55\"\" I got two years ago for about $1600 more and yes they are a better TV but I can buy two Vizio's that are of acceptable quality.  Got this TV for the kids game room.  Some of the Pros:- Decent picture.- Lots of Widget apps for network access.  Much better than Samsung.- Plenty of interface jacks.  Much more than you need given most people would connect stuff to a home theater system if you have that much stuff to connect.- WiFi works like a charm.  Already streamed a movie from Amazon Prime and Vudu.Cons:- Audio isn't the best, you have to play with it to get rid of the tinny sound but then OK.  Will probably get a sound bar at some point.- Very glossy screen.- In a dark room you can see brightness at the corners, black isn't as black.  Not that big a deal.- SD looks poor but does on most HDTV's.  This one is worse than my Samsungs.The biggest problem I had with this TV (which cost is a star) is when I powered it up the logo would flash an error code and then there was a black screen.  Figured, great, it is a dud.  Code was 2, 5, 11 flashes for anyone else that see's it.  Once the setup screen appeared but remote would not work (could only turn/on off scroll arrows would not work).  I never call tech support as they tend to be useless so tried a bunch of stuff.  Turned the TV on with the manual buttons and the setup screen appeared, then used the manual buttons to scroll work through the menus and there is one to sync the remote.  Once that was done all worked great and have never had the dreaded flashing logo again.  This really isn't acceptable given there is nothing in their guide about it and nothing on a Google search either (that was recoverable).  I guess ask again in 6 months and see if it occurs again.As a side note I used a $16.50 video mount (VideoSecu Ultra Slim), works great (had similar mount for my Samsungs but paid $100 for them).  Spacing on the back of the TV is about 16\"\" on center which makes using them a bit hard to hang but with two people and some slack in the wire you can get it to work.Even with the flashing logo error you can't beat the price and right now it is working great.  If things change you'll definitely see an Edit here.\"", "I was skeptical out of the box because I didn't think the picture had that great of colors, but after a lot of tweaking, it looked great (there's lots of options). It connected to my wifi easily and configuring apps was intuitive. I like the controller, it had no problem controlling my PS3, TV, and Cable Box. I guess it would be cooler if it were alluminum alloy, but it feels like my PS3 controllers, so that's good enough for me. Only 2 inches thick and was a lot lighter than my 46'in Samsung thats a couple years old. When I played a 3D PS3 game KillZone3 on it, I was amazed. My roommate and I both said the only thing we ever saw in the theatre that looked as good in 3D was Avatar, it smoked everything else. Juts be prewearned, 3D movies are EXPENSIVE ($30 a piece right now). The only place I could find them for rent was on the PlayStation Network for $7.50 a 24 hour rental (download the night before due to large file size). The only 3D and picture I saw better in store was a Sony that cost over a $1000 more, and it was barely better. The only negative thing I have to say is I accidentally smacked an HDMI cable (BTW you must get a 3D HDMI cable to watch 3D) against the screen and it made a quarter inch crack. Thatnkfully its only visible when you put a flash light up to it, but be careful with the screen. Also, I bought this through Amazon.com. I'm a Prime member and was able to schedule the exact date and time this was delivered. The guys called the same day to let me know they would be there. They were an hour late, but no big deal. They offered to let me ckeck it out before they left to verify it wasn't damaged. That's pretty nice considering I paid $0 for shipping. After I saw how good the 3D looked, I wish I would have spent the $800 more for the 65inch version! Great TV for the price. BTW-The sound built in isn't bad like what I read in other reviews. I have external studio monitors (KRK Rokit's) plugged in too for pro sound, but the built in sound was way better than what I expected after reading other reviews. I did have to go to the hardware store to get 4 6m 1inch screws to mount it on my swivel TV stand (no biggy). Cant't beat this TV for the price! BTW-no tax or shipping charges with reliable delivery makes buying from Amazon.com a no brainer!", "\"Just had my TV delivered. This is the first part of my review, since I did a lot of research to buy this TV. Originally, I was going to buy the 3D, 1080p, LG or Samsung TV. Then I researched and researched and researched and saw this TV. Originally came out in late 2011, this TV is comparable to the quality of LG and Samsung on a budget. Before I go too far, little bit of back history. I'm tech savy and had a Samsung 55\"\" LCD before, my sister has the 60\"\" Sharp Aquos, and I'm a designer, and my eyes are pretty sharp when it comes to quality of pictures, since that's how I make a living (I'm use to 27\"\" LED monitors with 2560 x 1440 dp).The thing that I hate about the modern 120 or 240 hz TV is that you can't watch old movies and still have that feeling of nostalgia, since everything looks like it's too real to life.Anyway, here it is:Pros:1. 3d is amazing.2. comes with 4 pair of good non-shuttering 3d glasses and they fit big heads3. Branding logo could be 'on' or 'off', which is great. A lot of the companies don't offer this option for an obvious reason, but by offering this option, I think the company respect us4. Excellent 2d pictures5. Excellent internet web apps, specifically Youtube and Amazon instant watch. I haven't tried Netflix, because, I don't subscribe to them anymore since a while ago, and Amazon Prime instant watch double as free two day shipping on stuff you buy on Amazon and it's only $75 or so6. Remote is very well designed with its piano black surface and nice feel buttons, that you don't have to press so hard to make it work. Sliding keyboard is pretty slick7. Setup was easy8. Going through the options are easy9. Equalizer for this price?? 3D? 1080? 240hz? I thought it was a scam until I got it today10. I really appreciate the semi-anti reflective surface of the tv. It's really nice.11. I thought this thing was going to be massively thick, since there are no picture of it sideways, but this is a slim design model.12. The base is heavy and sturdy and the polished metal connector tend to add a little something something.13. This TV has lots of connecting options that you usually find in something that costs about $500 or more.14. The delivery was excellent. They were on time, and the people who delivered actually took real good care of the tv while they were assembling. 15 minutes and bam, it was running and they were out the door. They didn't even stick around for a tip. They even offer to take the box to the trash (I live in the 4th floor).15. I hate these high definition TV's since the movie you watched as a child looks like a reality TV show... But I found out if you turn off the \"\"smooth motion effect\"\", your old movies will look just like how you saw it when you were a kid, but in a lot better resolution than before.Cons:1. No 2d to 3d conversion, which is not a big deal. At this price level, I think the 3d quality is excellent. At $500 more, the 2d to 3d conversion tend to suck2. The 3d Glasses don't look anything like what's on marketing (specifically the big chrome V on the side of the legs). But they're really comfortable and they will go over your glasses.3.It takes exactly 10 seconds to turn on, then it takes about another 10 seconds to open your internet apps. But really? Every time I have one of these first world problems, I remember Louis CK. \"\"You're sitting in a chair in Sky!\"\"4. I think when the black space is empty, without any fillers, like in film, and it's just black for the purpose of being black, not dark, you could see some blooming on the sides, specifically 4 on each side, exactly.5. The internet web app's UI/UX could be better, but I'm not complaining. There is a 55\"\" TV that is connected to my TV and it brings me free videos from the internet!6. Remote is filled with my finger prints. You only notice it when you see it up close, and honestly, it doesn't bother me. But it is only infrared, and I wish they were wifi based like Samsung or LG or Sony, so I could get an android app on my phone for it. Youtube remote is available for Androids.7.I had my external hard drive connected with full of movies via USB onto the TV, but it didn't register when I was setting up, so I think you have to connect your computer to access your external hard drive library.8. I wish they used more of the color coded buttons as options. I'm still confused about \"\"back\"\" vs \"\"exit\"\", since back doesn't work sometimes, and exit sometimes exit you out of the apps.9. Equalizer takes some time to configure. Good thing is that they work without confirming or selecting first.10. The screen still reflects a little bit, but I don't notice it that much. But you can see your blurry lamp in the background. I try to put a custom made lamp behind the TV, about 5 inches away from the TV's back plate, but that created a wavy motion on the screen after 15 minutes, so I had to move the lamp. I'm sure the LED lights work a lot better, although my lamp was at 45watt, and was surrounded by an aluminum body.11. The fit and quality of the frame is questionable. They try to save money by putting two panels together on top of the screen instead of having a long and single panel of plastic. Plus the shiny frame is too reflective and distracting. I wish it was matte finished.12. The base is shiny too, so it collects every tiny hair from my dog and cats. But it's not a big deal.13. The apps do crash, so your Youtube will crash, then you have to turn the TV off and on and again.14. For some reason, the apps tend to load for a long time, each time you start the TV.15. No upgrade, or update firmware options. I hope it's automatically done...16. First world problem : A lot of features that I have to learn...17. I heard this TV lasts about 8 months and dies. Well, at this price, that's not such a bad thing. You could do worst.Overall:Really good 3D quality, 2D is very good, a lot of options, and internet apps work great. If you don't think too much about the little things, you'd probably enjoy this tv.\"", "\"Only thing that I can knock is the CEVA delivery. Why do they have you schedule a delivery window, then miss it by 5 hours without a call to tell you they are running behind?  Trying to reach anyone who could give specific info took and act of congress. We all know how that works.  Well, I won't deduct stars because this is a review of the TV, and I had the same delivery folks deliver my Panasonic TC-P55VT50 3 weeks earlier and they did swell. So many others here have gone through great pains to list the good, the bad and ugly, I'm going to keep it short by saying I'm totally impressed with this set. Comparing it to the plasma I bought, I wish I had bought this TV and saved about $700. Although the Panny VT50 plasma is a great TV and has a butt load more bells and whistles, this Vizio is seriously impressive were it counts. The remote is a bit tough on the old folks in that the buttons a small and the type should have been in BOLD. Anyway, the TV setup is supper easy and it has a stunning picure out of the box in \"\"standard\"\" mode. We hooked mom's new Panny Blu-ray and ran through the Disney WOW disc's test screens and the only tweaks involved increasing the contrast and color a few ticks. I can HIGHLY recommend this TV.\"", "So far I'm very impressed with this TV especially for the price.  We have enjoyed the passive 3D it looks great for what it is and you do not have the bulky active shutter glasses.The picture quality (for a non-videophile) is VERY nice.The built in apps are weak at best but for Netflix streaming works well.Overall I would buy this TV again."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.011957847513258457, 0.001573225948959589, 0.0023683873005211353, 0.020075393840670586, 0.0063770790584385395, 0.17626556754112244, 0.6103900671005249, 0.01584199257194996, 0.13049651682376862, 0.0020130369812250137, 0.022640956565737724]]}
