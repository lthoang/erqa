I have owned Toshiba TV's in the past. I owned two Toshiba rear projections TV's and then went to the LCD flat screens. I bought this TV at a local brick and mortar store that wears blue shirts and has yellow signage. It was easy to bring home and hook right up.For the bedroom it is perfect! I have it sitting on a desk which is perfect height wise for the bed. The sound is not great but I hooked it up to aVIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Barwhen I watch TV. It sounds wonderful! I managed to put the sound bar behind the TV stand since it sits out a little far. I also am using it as a monitor to a PC I have in the bedroom that I rarely use. However, having the VGA input is perfect; the picture is nice even though it is only 4:3 aspect ratio for the PC. I also have a Roku hooked up to it via a HDMI cable and it looks and sounds great!When I crawl into bed tired, I love watching TV on my Toshiba. With tax I spent more than what it is listed here but am very happy with it. I don't watch much sports or action movies so the 60Hz is fine for me.I don't know if I would have this as a main TV but as a bedroom TV, it is perfect! I am very satisfied with it and glad I purchased it.", "\"When I bought this TV I was expecting same HD quality as other Toshiba TV that I bought. While it was indeed high definition, the picture quality was very sub-par, almost to the point that my eyes get sore after watching the screen for a while. The problem with this TV is that it is very dim. After doing some research, I found out that this was due to the \"\"Energy Saving Setting\"\". If you are suffering from the same problem, I think a good way to remedy is either return this TV or remove \"\"Energy Saving Setting\"\" via following method:MENU > PREFERENCES > Scroll down to ENERGY SAVING SETTINGS (you won't see it on the screen because its listed underneath Regza Link Player Control and Channel Browser Setup. Keep scolling down, then Turn off Energy Saving Setting.&lt;Much Thanks to another reviewer who posted this remedy!>\"", "Bought this TV for my daughter's nursery. Yes, she's 16 months old and you're probably saying &#34;what the hell does a baby need with a 40&#34; TV?&#34; Well, we spend a lot of time with her in her room, and she loves here Gabba Gabba. This was a Black Friday deal, and why would you NOT buy a 40&#34; LCD when you can get it for the price of a 24&#34;? Duh. Looks great on the wall in her room, and has a very good picture for a TV in this price range.", "Okay folks the Toshiba Model 40E220U was or is a black Friday deal at Best Buy for $179.00... You know why ? because Toshiba is out of the TV business and any Toshiba TV is likely stock that was left over...I wouldn't recommend buying any Toshiba TV without first checking about support at their website and to see if You can get this TV somewhere else.  I bought it at Best Buy for $179.00  LOL  Gonna just use it in the bedroom anyway. But it's worth the 179.00.  Just be careful when and where you buy Toshiba TVs.", "I bought mine at a retail store this weekend for my bedroom.In demo mode, the HDTV produced rich colors and impressive darks, but then again don't all TV's in retails stores look this good?Setup was rather easy as Comcast 480i (4:3) signal was identified and HDTV was up and running in minutes.  I also changed the screen output to TheaterWide-1 since I'm not getting HD Cable in my bedroom.After tinkering with the settings, I couldn't get the picture to look acceptable because the screen looked grayed out and too dark.  I was about to pack it up and return it but opted to tinker with it one more time.To remedy the darkness of the screen and brighten it up 75% higher, goto MENU > PREFERENCES > Scroll down to ENERGY SAVING SETTINGS (you won't see it on the screen because its listed underneath Regza Link Player Control and Channel Browser Setup.  Keep scolling down, then Turn off Energy Saving Setting.If you stand up close to the screen, you can see minor defects of distortion but it disappears after you back away a few feet.  For the price of the TV, this is a good bargain.", "I have had this TV for several months and now feel I can write an honest review. In all I am pleased with the TV, for the price. This is no LED, it is larger, heavy and with only 60hz it is not amazing quality. But it is a good looking picture for things such as hockey, movies and video games.My real gripe is  the HDMI inputs. While watching cable if I change from an HD channel to non HD (or ever premium channel to non premium) the tv loses input and I am forced to power on/off. Same thing happens if I change from HDMI1 to HDMI2. This is very frustrating.I do not have a lot of experience using this tv with my computer through HDMI out, but was successful streaming once so no complaints.I have used both the stand included and a 3d wall mount with swivel extension which makes the tv look very nice. Although because it is larger than newer tvs it does stick out from the wall a good amount, but as long as it is not being put up near a walkway this is acceptable.Platstation 3 works well.If I could somehow fix the HDMI issue I would give this tv 5 stars.", "\"This may turn out to be a very good TV eventually when I upgrade to High-Def programming, but it took me the better part of two days to make it watchable with standard def Dish Network satellite service and standard def DVD still looks horrible. I'll try to update this review later when I've had a chance to upgrade to high-def satellite programming. Meanwhile, here are some tips to try and save extra hassle for other new owners. Initial problems were made a lot worse by Toshiba's failure to include a decent set of instructions in the box. If I'd bought this at a local store instead of online, there's a good chance I would have given up and taken it back. If you don't already have a blu-ray DVD player with upsampling or high-def TV programming, you may want to consider making those upgrades first before you buy this TV so you'll know how good it really is while you still have time to return it. The best thing about this TV so far is I was able to get it for the same price online as discount brands at my local Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The first thing any new owner should do is download a copy of the full owner's manual from Toshiba's web site and keep it open on a laptop in the same room if possible. Don't turn the TV on until after you have plugged in all your input devices (cable/satellite box, DVR, DVD player, etc.) and have them all turned on so the TV set can detect all of the input signals you will be using; this is most important if you use a standard def coax Ant/Cable, or a standard def cable/satellite box. After the initial setup, the first thing you'll want to look for is the \"\"Energy Saver Setting\"\" for automatic brightness control to see if it makes your picture too dark and if turning this off helps make it bright enough for you. You can turn this back on later if you like to keep news or other programming on in the background all day and want to save some electricity. For any inputs with standard def devices, you'll want to look for Noise Reduction settings and the CableClear option. Turning the noise reduction settings up to high is what made my standard def satellite box (Dish Network DVR 625)go from unwatchable to pretty good, but I had to spend some time browsing and searching through the full owner's manual I downloaded to find out about this. I also wound up having to reset the TV a couple times because nothing was connected the first time I hit the power button and the CableClear option wasn't available on picture settings menu. The CableClear option showed up after doing a reset with everything plugged in and turned on.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0006848680786788464, 0.002295195823535323, 0.26393923163414, 0.10507626086473465, 0.16835914552211761, 0.4478856921195984, 0.011759542860090733]]}
