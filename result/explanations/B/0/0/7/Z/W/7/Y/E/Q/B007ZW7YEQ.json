However, I prefer the 250 AW for its more spacious compartments and only a little bit larger size. The zippers on here are also tricky to manager and go all the way under the bag -- not the best thing when you need to quickly pull out your camera for that \"\"one\"\" shot.The Urban Photo Sling is also a great bag, however. It is durable and didn't rip when I accidentally dropped it on a sharp metal edge (without the camera, thankfully).Having experienced the 250 AW, I feel like this is just not as good of a value.\"", "\"This bag is a compact, well built daytripping camera bag.  I have several large photo bags and have been searching for a good one that I can take on hikes and daytrips.  This bag fits the bill.What I love...+ I'm 5'4\"\" and so a lot of bags swallow me up.  This one fits perfectly on my bag and the strap is comfortable across my chest.  I do think the bag would be more comfortable with a sweatshirt or jacket on (rather than a thin tshirt) because of where the strap rests on my rib cage.  But, the secure feeling I get from having a belt around my waist makes up for that.  Up this point, I have only had this small bag (Cosmos Khaki Green Shoulder Canvas Outdoor Camera Bag/deluxe Photo/video Camera Gadget Bag for Canon Nikon Sony Olympus Kodak Panasonic Fuji Digital DSLR Cameras + Cosmos Cable Tiefor daytrips.  If I climb up any steep hills (as we often do when we go hiking), the bag swings around or I have to hold it in front of me and hope that I don't fall.  With this Lowepro bag, I can bend over with this bag on my back and the belt around my waist and the bag doesn't move at all.  Yippee!+ The bag can fit my Canon T3i, a smallish dslr, with my flash, a 40mm prime lens and a 60mm macro lens attached to my camera.  I could fit a small zoom in the bag if I wanted to, but not much more.  It actually fits less than my cosmos bag when it comes to extras, but the support and comfort of the bag on my back make it a much better choice for hiking and daytrips filled with walking.+ There is a small front pocket where you could stow an ID, a few dollars, an extra camera battery, and lens cleaning cloth.  You could also store a cell phone in this pocket.+ The clasps on the side make it easy to simply open the top flap without worrying about the bag falling open and everything falling out.+ It is so easy to swing around the bag to my front and pull out my camera!+ The belt stows away inside the bag if you don't want to use it.+ If you're in a crowd of people and feel the need to hold onto your bag, it swings around easily to your chest and is very easy to hold onto for security.What I'm not so crazy about...- The zippers are not as good as the ones on other Lowepro bags I have.  The padding is on the thinner size.  Different Lowepro bags have different thicknesses of inner padding pieces.  I like the thicker pieces.  The zippers are something that you have to figure out.  If you play with the bag and figure out where it's easiest for you to open, you can find a good position for the zippers.  The zippers do open much easier if the bag is on a table than if it is on one's back.The zippers are the only thing that keep me from giving this bag 5 stars.  I will have to get used to the pressure from the strap on my rib cage, but they did a good job with placing padding under the ring where the strap attaches to the bag on the lower end.  The padding doesn't move or bunch up easily.I wish I could give this bag 4 1/2 stars...\"", "\"I have a LARGE camera bag for extended trips and a small bag big enough to hold my SLR and not much else. This bag fills the gap in-between these two.Pros-Design makes it hard for you to accidentally drop your expensive gear-Top section offers quick and easy access to your SLR-Easily accommodates a range of lens lengths. I tried it with my Tamron 300mm lens and there was more than enough room.-Weight distribution is very good, and the bag can be easily positioned on your back and then swung to your front for easy access-Lightweight - only 1.3 pounds-Bonus! A dedicated compartment for your favorite tablet. My iPad fits securely in place-Back padding and shoulder strap are more breathable than cheaper models - great while walking or biking on a hot day-Zippers, stitching and padding all seem sturdy and otherwise well-made.-Zippered pouch on the front for other items - wallet, phone, batteries, etc.Cons-Don't let the second picture fool you - you will NOT be able to fit a normal-sized bottle of water in the side pouch. The bottle shown in that pic must be designed for halflings.A couple of notes:I would feel comfortable carrying this bag around in relatively safe locations. For travel to less-safe locations I would take a less-conspicuous bag. That's not a knock on this bag however, as it applies to all easily identifiable camera/laptop bags that proclaim \"\"I am carrying expensive electronics\"\".On the way home today I first packed my Canon SLR with a 300mm Tamron lens. That took up 3 of the 4 internal, easily configurable, pockets. By tinkering with the dividers I was able to get a Speedlite in there too. Before I left the office, I changed the config a bit. With a smaller lens I was able to get both a speedlite and wide angle lens in the bottom section with no problem. In both configurations I was able to easily slip in my iPad, as well as iPhone, keys, wallet and extra camera battery in the zippered front pocket. I could have fit one or two more small items as well.During my bike ride home the bag stayed mostly in place on my back. The exception was when going down one fairly steep hill, in which case it started to slip a bit. It was never uncomfortable, and was in fact more comfortable than my standard messenger bag.After the hour-long ride home the bag was a bit damp but dried relatively quickly.\"", "\"I have a sony nex-7 camera and a couple of lenses. My ideal bag would let me carry them and a few other accessories (batteries, sd cards, lens cleaner, bad elf gps, keys, sun glasses) and my ipad mini. I also wanted something that I feel like I am still traveling light.After an exhaustive search, this bag seemed perfect. Not only did it have a dedicated pocket for the ipad and room for my camera and lenses but it it is very classy looking black.... and is a sling which I prefer.When it came I was so excited to put all my stuff in. The bag has a lot of room. I also noticed that the way the zipper works it makes it difficult for someone to open the bag or its pocket without you taking it off. This is great for traveling and worrying about \"\"sticky finger\"\" trying to access your stuff.The sony nex 7 is not the biggest nor smallest camera. This is one of the things that I really like about it. As I started packing up my camera and lenses, I soon realized that the real useable space wasn't as plentiful as I thought. In fact, the front pocket feels near useless because it is too tight to open. Things like a battery, pens, memory cards should all fit in, nit nothing too much bigger.As far as the iPad, this bag is marketed to fit the full size iPad. I felt my ipad mini was going to be flopping around. Not so, my mini didn't have much extra room. In fact I don't see how the full size ipad would fit in this bag, especially if you have a case on it. I could be wrong about this but I don't have a full size one to test out. This would definitely be something you would want to test. Even if you could get it in, I think it would be hard to quickly get in and out.As far as bag quality, I think it rates an 8 out of 10. The zippers seem a little cheap, but other wise good construction.One regret is there is no place to carry a tripod with this bag, If that is important. From time to time, I do like to carry one.Testing it in the Field:My wife and I went out of town for a weekend in Boston. I thought that this would be the perfect place to really put this bag through its paces. We walked quite a bit around the city visiting historical site and used the camera quite a bit.What I found was this was not the most comfortable bag. It wasn't bad and maybe for someone else's body shape they may have better experience. As a point of reference I am 5'5 and while I have a slight bit of extra weight in my stomach, for the most part I am in shape.I found that the bag didn't contour to my back. As a result, as we were out, I constantly knew it was on my back. Some bags shape to your body better and allow you to walk for miles with less bag-fatigue. This was not true for this bag.I did love the ability to carry my iPad with me. There were many times that we stopped and looked up more info about where we were, searched for something or had the ability to read while my wife shopped.Conclusion:To summarize my complaints about this bag, it is lack of useable room, less the spacious front pocket, uncomfortable and i stubble to see how a full size iPad fit.BUT.... and this is a big but.....I know that these could be based on me and my gear. For someone else, this may be a great bag for their gear and fit their body just fine. I would highly recommend seeing if you stuff fits. Then put it on and walk around a little. See what it feels like to wear it for 15, 20, 30 minutes.Again, I loved this bag. And I really wish it would have worked for me. But there were too many strikes against it.I have yet to find the perfect case, but currently I am testing the case logic SLRC-205 which overcomes a lot of my complaints with this bag. Although the jury is still out.\"", "This camera bag was comfortable to wear and I liked that it wasn't your typical bulky bag but honestly those are the only pros I found.  What attracted me to this bag was the thought that a sling type bag would be easy to get gear in and out. I recently had twins and it's not often I don't have at least one baby balanced on a hip. I was hoping I would be able to get my camera in and out quickly to capture those fleeting moments with my kids.  However, I found the zipper extremely difficult to open so much so that I have to put everything down, take the bag off completely and finagle the thing just to get it opened and closed.  Additionally, the bag is so small that it's difficult to fit anything besides your camera in it. No extra lenses and no huge lenses either.  I was really hoping to enjoy this product, unfortunately it just hasn't met my needs.", "Fits my husband's D7000 with the flash and battery charger.  There is plenty of room.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  Quality-made.", "Bag itself is great but there is something missing. I just exchanged this camera sling bag to 'In****' sling bag. that is great choice. build quality both no problem. I can say outstanding. This bag is more for DSLR owner with 2 fixed focal length lenses and one70-200 tele zoom lens. I own mirrorless camera with small 3-4lenses. that is why this bag is way too big but I like its look and feel. looks like professional. Oh. One more thing about this. shoulder strap is little bulky so big and tall guys are no problem but...", "The quality of the materials is good, but the backpack is too small for mySony Alpha SLT-A99V Full-Frame 24.3 MP SLR Digital Camera with 3-Inch LED - Body Only (Black). Technically, the A99 fits in the pack, but the weight of the camera (+ theSony 24 -70mm f/2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras) forces the bag to sag to the side of my back. It bumps my arm as I walk. Using the waist belt helps to center the pack, but doing so isn't the most comfortable; and even so, the weight isn't well balanced. Having tested the Lowepro LP36417-PWW andLowepro LP36576-PWW 250 AW Transit Sling Bag (Slate Grey)together, I much prefer the latter for [currently] $23.04 more. That said, this backpack worked fine with myCanon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.Note: I have an iPad 2, and it would not fit in the backpack while the iPad was in its case (I have theBelkin Cinema Dot Folio Case / Cover with Stand for the New Apple iPad with Retina Display (4th Generation) & iPad 3 and iPad 2 (Black/Grey)). It barely fits in the bag without a case, and when I had the A99 in there, it wouldn't fit at all (pocket too tight).", "\"The Sling 150 makes for a great camera bag with it's divided, removable sections. It will hold a DSLR body and one lens easily. You can also take out all the dividers and make a really nice \"\"Pack Bag\"\" that gives you lots of room for almost anything. Or, keep the dividers in it, re-arrange them and you've got a bag to take to work to hold your lunch, papers and assorted other stuff. The pack has a flap that folds over the top and velcros in place to help as a double layer to keep out moisture, lots of pockets for small items (like flash cards) and all in a secure but easy to open bag. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is no separate bag to put the dividers in when not in use.\"", "This is a well constructed, very sturdy bag that's everything I need for my day out for taking pics.I'm carrying my Sony Nex-F3 with it's 18-55mm lens along with my E 55-210mm telephoto lens, in case I want that and everything fits perfectly.There's space for several more things, in case I want to pack more stuff.There's a space for a tablet, but I don't currently have a tablet so my Filofax has a space in the bag!The Quality of the Lowepro Photo Sling is outstanding, this is my second Lowepro bag and I want some of their other size bags as well,amazing Quality.This is one BEAUTIFUL & STURDY Camera bag with tons of room and built to last", "The Lowepro Urban Photo Sling 150 is a well-constructed camera bag that, despite its name, is not a great choice for use in urban areas.Why? The bag has a bloated, squat shape that makes it too bulky to wear in crowded places. It's like having a big fat watermelon strapped to your torso. When riding on a packed bus or walking along a crowded sidewalk, you will not be very popular with the people around you.Despite this flaw, the Urban Photo Sling 150 could be a good choice for somebody who wants a bag that is designed to be difficult for thieves to access. Key features include a nylon flap, secured by plastic squeeze clips, that covers the main zippers, an easily configurable camera compartment, and elastic bands attached to the exterior straps for managing loose strap ends. Most importantly, the bag feels balanced when it's loaded with gear.Bottom line: while I like the features and construction of this sling camera bag, I feel its unwieldy shape limits where it can be comfortably used. Three stars.", "\"The most important thing to know about this bag is that, despite its similarity to many \"\"shoulder bag\"\" designs, it is intended to be worn cross-body, i.e. over-the-head.  It WILL NOT stay on your shoulder as a shoulder bag.It worked well for my Nikon D7000 with a 55-200 lens, with room for a couple more lenses/hoods and an external flash, and I felt like things were well-padded.  Unfortunately, that means it is about twice as large as I'd really like to carry, but until somebody develops TARDIS technology for camera bags, that's just the way it is.  There are effectively two \"\"compartments\"\" which each have hook and loop dividers to be made into a total of four compartments.  One can access them from the top, or zip the zippers all the way down and get in through the side. The bag is very, VERY light.  The padded slot for a tablet is a really neat idea.  The front pocket is pretty shallow -- I found it tight for a phone, wallet and sunglasses.  My bigger problem with the front pocket is that it is only close-able with hook and loop, so it makes a loud ripping noise whenever you access it (so much for that wildlife shot!).The idea is that this bag will be right there in front of you, so your camera is easily accessible.  Unfortunately, that was really uncomfortable for me.  The strap is wide and, although it is easily adjusted (other straps should work as well!), there just isn't a lot of length to play with.  To try to put it delicately, if one has ample d&eacute;colletage, it is difficult to get the bag low enough for comfort and access when worn in the front, and the wide strap tends to ride up on the neck when the bag is worn in the back.  There *is* a waist strap tucked into a sleeve at the bottom of the bag, but if that is at my waist -- or even at my hips -- there is just too much \"\"bag\"\"; the top opening ends up under my chin, and I'm not especially short or high-waisted.  I think this might be best suited for tall, long-in-the-trunk, ent-like individuals (possibly the same mythical creatures for whom airline headrests were designed).  I'm afraid I'm headed back to using a backpack-type bag, which I can sling over either shoulder OR wear in the back -- more finagling required to get to the camera, but less claustrophobic.\"", "This bag has a variety of little pockets for batteries and various accessories.  Neatly fits my Canon 40D with aTamron AF 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras.  Room for a Kindle or other tablet (or even a conventional paper note book).The pack itself is light weight.  The main compartment pads to adjust for various camera sizes, lens, and various odds -n- ends.The top has a great waterproof cover which is great here in the Pacific Northwest", "This is what I am using now for my T3i.  I have an 18-55mm stock lens, a 55-250 mm zoom lens and a 50 mm prime lens that fit comfortably in this bag.  There are Velcros inside so you can customize the sizes of the compartments. On the top zippered cover flap, it has a small pouch where I put 5 extra SD cards.  It is also protected by a Velcro lid so you don't lose any of them. All sides and from top to bottom, the bag is padded.The front has a double zippered pouch that I use to carry 2 extra batteries.  It has a couple of pockets that you can use for anything you want like cables, earphones, money, etc.The shoulder strap is wide and comfortable.  It is easily adjustable to one's height.  It also has a hidden waist strap that you can utilize if you want it.  I like that it has a  handle on top which is the easiest way to carry the bag if you don't want to use the shoulder strap.A padded compartment can comfortable accomodate a tablet or an iPad.Cons:- the zipper does an excellent way of making sure you don't drop your equipment from the bag, but still not the best nor the most convenient way of  quickly taking out the camera  when you need it.", "\"I recently had the chance to review the line of the new Pro Messenger series. I have used LowePro products for the previous 15 years and owned nearly every bag they produced including Fast Packs, Pro Roller (x200 and x300), Slingbags, Stealth Reporter, Event Messenger, the previous Messenger line, etc.... I also owned many Think Tank, Tamrac, and Timbuk2 bags. I admit openly I was (am) addicted to gear bags. Last year, I switched entirely to the Domke brand mainly because, as with many photographers, my shooting style changed. I also chose to go retro with a minimalist approach since I took up street shooting. By comparison, LowePro bags are generally bulkier by design to maximize gear protection whereas Domke bags are designed to be more streamlined, in a minimalist fashion. So, when given an opportunity to checkout the LowePro, I was interested.  I figured this bag would challenge my Domke F-2 I use for street shooting now.This LowePro is a very compact and lightweight bag.  It also has the typical LowePro quality longtime LowePro fans expect, with only the zippers posing a possible build (not necessarily quality) issue. You can easily consider the design aspect of this bag to be evolutionary given the prior LowePro slingbags (and hybrids) such as theLowepro SlingShot 102 AWorLowepro LP36392-PAM DSLR Video Fastpack 150 AW (Black), which are simply bulkier, heavier, and far less streamlined.  The Urban Photo Sling 150 is specifically designed for fast moving in an urban environment and takes on a minimalist approach to achieve this aspect by significantly limiting the amount of gear you can carry.  However, because of this, the bag becomes a Street Shooter's dream.This bag was clearly designed for smaller DSLR's such as the Nikon D90 and not the full body Nikon D4 or even a D300s w/grip. I was able to fit my D300 w/out grip, 60mm prime, 50mm 1.4, SB-910 flash, and some small accessories such as a rocket blower and filters.  Fitting my Ipad was a very tight proposition but can be done. The bag provides a decent assortment of outer pockets for money, ID, keys, phone, etc- that I found convenient when on the move in a city. The outer bag clasps will prevent an accidental spill of the camera when you open the bag, a good carryover from other models (I once saw a guy drop a D700 from a different brand sling bag because it did not have these clasps). The design of the bag allows it to fit very comfortably on your back, or even when \"\"slinging\"\" the bag to your front.  The strap is designed in such a way that it is very comfortable while avoiding the \"\"man boob\"\" look larger guys have to contend with.  The bag also utlizes a cross strap to keep the bag from swinging at all. Internal pockets on the inside of the flap hold memory cards. The bottle holder on the side of the bag is very small and does not hold any of my water bottles.As always, camera bags are about compromise in response to specific applications.  That is why I have been known to collect them over the years. In this case, you will have to limit what you carry (stating the obvious here). In return, you will have a great bag for urban street shooting or commuting on public transportation.\"", "I got this for use with my Sony camcorder and it fits the camcorder and all accessories perfectly, without being overly bulky or sacrificing on protection. It's probably not going to work great for bulkier cameras, but for my use it works just fine and I can definitely recommend it.", "\"Though the product images show a good-sized camera and lens in this bag, I still found myself pleasantly surprised at just how big and roomy this bag is.  While the box that it arrived in was overkill for shipping it in, I'm not sure that there's a standard sized box between the smaller boxes that Amazon usually ships in and the bigger one this item arrived in that would have been deep enough and/or big enough to hold this large bag.  It isn't ridiculously large, but it isn't a small little bag either.  Just under \"\"backpack\"\" size seems about where I'd wind up calling it.I love that it has various pockets and areas built into it that offer plenty of places to put accessories and other items that I might want to lug around with me when venturing out with my DSLR (though I could also put a couple of high zoom point and shoot type cameras in this bag and lug them around if I choose to).  Really it just offers a nice amount of carrying space and capacity while also offering a comfortable sling carrying system that should work for most potential buyers.Definitely recommended for purchase.\"", "I have never owned a sling style bag, but I wanted to try it out with an Olympus E-PL5 camera and a few lenses.  The sling style means that the bag goes over a shoulder and around your chest and the bag usually ends up in back, but you could sling it around to the side or in front of you.  This style makes it easy to access the bag and it also distributes the weight better than a shoulder bag.  I admit that I am still getting used to this style of bag, but I can see where it would be a convenient way to wear it.  The bag also comes with a belt that will help support the bag and it tucks out of sight when not in use.The bag is secure even if you wear it on your back.  You can only access the gear from the top because you have to unclip two clips and unzip it to allow it to open completely up. There is an accessory pocket on the front of the bag, but you have to  undo velcro, which makes noise, and unzip the compartment.  A criminal would probably need to cut it off of you if they really wanted it.The bag has a lot of cushioning which protects the lenses and an iPad (if you carry one).  Be aware that most iPad cases will not fit in the iPad compartment.  I was able to fit the iPad 3 with the Apple Smart cover, but it is very snug.  The other compartments can be arranged by removing flaps and adjusting them.  With my Olympus E-Pl5, I was able to fit the camera with the Olympus 40-150mm attached, the 14-42mm kit lens, a Panasonic 20mm pancake lens, a Canon 85mm 1.8, and a Canon 50mm f1.8 lens.  They all fit without a problem, but I did borrow a flap from another bag so I would not have two lenses in one compartment.  I also put the Canon adapter in the front accessory pouch.  I also had the iPad in its slot.  There is also room for batteries in the accessory pocket and a separate slot in the top flap for an SD card.Since I know some will wonder, I also tried it out with a 5D Mark III camera.  The camera is a lot more snug, but I was able to get it zipped up.  I was able to carry a 24-105mm f4 in one side and a 70-200mm f4 IS attached to the camera on the other side.  I have a sling strap on the camera, so I elected to leave out the iPad and tuck the strap into the iPad slot.  It would work if someone wanted it for this purpose.  I also tried it with a 100-400mm in place of the 70-200mm and it works, but it is extremely tight.  I have no plans of using the bag this way.  I would have gotten the bigger bag if I wanted it to work with my Canon.  Also, I have a Black Rapid Strap and I would have two large straps across my chest and I don't think I would want to wear it that way.  My Olympus has a Gordy Adjustable neck strap that I often wear like a sling strap, but it is so light and thin that the criss crossing isn't a problem.If you are looking for a sling style bag with great cushioning for a micro four thirds setup, I think this bag may be you answer.", "This is my third sling bag--and right now it ranks in third place with me.  Why? First of all the product photos are a bit misleading regarding size.  Sure you can put your iPad in the bag--but you really have to squeeze it in and it better only have a smart cover on it.  The side pocket that looks like it can hold a water bottle--I can barely stick four flat fingers in the pocket--that is how tight it is.The main interior pocket is about 4 inches deep, 8 inches across, and 10 inches wide.  It comes with a couple dividers that you can rearrange--but I'm having trouble getting a decent and sturdy arrangement that will work with my T2i that will allow me to quickly and easily remove the camera.I also find the pockets hard to access.  To get into the large front pocket you have to pull back the flap top which is a bit harder than it sounds and then unzip the pocket.  That opens up a space that isn't well organized.  The other small pocket is located inside the main compartment and all it holds is a memory card.Perhaps I'm just spoiled with my other bags.  Other reviewers here give it high marks.My favorite sling bag is the Case Logic DCB-308 SLR Camera Sling bag. It is slightly larger than this bag but that space is really organized well and I can actually carry my Canon T2i and Canon Rebel XT, both with long lenses on them--plus other items. That bag also has a lot of pockets that are organized well--and easy to get to!  It is currently selling on Amazon for around $50.00.My second favorite sling bag is the Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW. It is a smaller bag--close to the overall size of this one--but it is longer and a bit thinner.
