I do have the 3rd generation so it's great.  It sync's right with the keyboard and keeps a charge forever.  I would say I go at least a month without charging the cover/keyboard.  One thing you have to be aware of is that the IPAD will always want you to use the screen keyboard, but just by tapping the space key or any key on this unit, the screen keyboard will go away and allow you to use the cover keyboard.  Love it.  I can type so much faster with this than hunting and pecking on the screen.  If this product got lost, I would purchase another.", "\"This review was written by my daughter.I will start off by saying that I am really enjoying using this keyboard case. Despite a few flaws, they are not enough to make me not love it!  I am giving it 4 stars, though, instead of 5, as it is not without some glitches in design. Most of my complaints have already been covered in other people's review so I am not going to go into great detail to spare you the repetitive comments.What I don't like (although none of these are enough to make me -- unlike some  other reviewers -- not want to keep this case):-- The number one thing ...and this is the only one that REALLY bothers me....is that the cover doesn't put the iPad to sleep when it's closed; and sometimes when the cover is shut and I have manually put the iPad to sleep, it comes back on without me knowing, so my iPad is ON with the cover closed.  That's pretty annoying.-- The keyboard is small, but that's par for the course.  They had to make it small to fit in the case.  You'll get used to it. I have had it for three weeks now and I just finally stopped hitting \"\"return\"\" when I was trying to hit the quotes. Whatever. It's fine.-- Another thing that sort of annoys me about the keyboard is the placement of certain character keys.  We are used to hitting shift for heavily-used character keys such as \"\"?\"\" and \"\":\"\" and \"\";\"\" and \"\"/\"\".  Well, on this keyboard you do hit shift for some things, but for some of the major ones (like the ones mentioned above) you have to hit Function on the left side of the keyboard.  It's hard to get used to this. But it's not enough to make me abandon this product because I love using it. A little annoying, yes, but you can adapt to it.-- The case is pretty heavy once you've got the iPad in there. It doesn't really bother me so much, though, and I'd rather have something heavy if I feel it offers more protection.-- IT does mess up my Ghost Armour skin I have. Sometimes it creates bubbles or lifts, but once I smooth them out it's fine.-- When you stand the iPad up, especially in portrait mode, it is pretty vertical and it's slightly annoying. I got over it. Really not a big deal.All that being said, I love this case!!!  Why?--  Amazingly, in the three weeks I have had it (and used it A LOT), I have not had to charge the keyboard once. NOT ONCE!!!!-- Before this, I had a silicone roll-up keyboard from Brookstone which I thought would be cool because it was a full-size keyboard and I could fold it up and put it anywhere in my bag and it weighed nothing.  However, it felt so weird to type on and I made so many errors.  And it NEVER held a charge.  So here I was with my wireless bluetooth keyboard that I had to use PLUGGED IN.  WTH?!?!  This is soooo much better!!!-- It's sturdy, protects my iPad well enough, and fits nicely in my bag.-- I use it all day at work and I have literally not touched my computer since I got it!-- I love always having an easy-to-type on keyboard at the ready and even use it on my lap on the subway!-- I like that I can turn the keyboard and stand it up either in portrait or landscape because not every app rotate onscreen when you rotate the iPad.-- Some readers said that their iPad fell out of it?!?!  There is no way for that to happen!  It's in the grooves so sturdily!  They had to have been using a version of the iPad that this case was not made for....that's the only thing I can think of. Or they didn't put the iPad in it correctly....So, that's that.  I love having the case, despite the few flaws, and it's amazing that I have never had to charge it yet in almost a month!  Coming from what I had before, this keyboard case was a WELCOME gift!!!!  I hope you enjoy it, too!!!\"", "I bought this after a friend purchased it. I loved how perfectly it fit on my elliptical bars--- I can exercise and type out an email at the same time. I love how sleek the case is, how well it closes. How easily the iPad comes in and out of it when you want to change cases. It protects the iPad well. Easy to access buttons and plug ins. The keyborard is easy to use and works well. I have had to charge it a few times, but its rare. My keyboard did come a bit unglued after several months but I think its because I left it in the hot car a few times. I am just going to put a little more double sided tap under it. I can not complain I love how this turns my iPad into a laptop. Highly recommend. If only it came in pink!", "OK- let me begin with the only reason I am giving this case a four out of five is because there is no auto-off feature with this case. Some are magnetized to put your iPad into sleep mode when you close it, this is not one of those. Further, the keyboard itself must be turned on and off manually (small switch) in order to prevent your battery life from draining fairly quickly. All that being said the design and usability of the piece are outstanding. A clean, professional looking exterior, a place to hold my iPen inside, and the keyboard sits down in a little lip that prevents the keys from scratching up the iPad glass. The rubber band closure is a bit under-dressed for this model, but it does its job well and hold the case firmly shut. It would be more impressive looking if they could do a snap closure instead. The only other thing I could squabble about is that this case makes the iPad a bit heavy to hold if you are not utilizing the keyboard. While the keyboard stows quietly away when not in use, behind the iPad, it still adds weight to the whole kit and caboodle. On the whole, if you need a professional looking, durable keyboard and cover, this product nails both of those requirements. Grade: A", "\"Aesthetically, this keyboard case works. The leather exterior looks sophisticated and professional. Functionally, however, this case doesn't hit all marks. The keyboard works well enough, and the case seems quite sturdy (although I wouldn't drop my iPad to test it out). The problem is the stand mechanics of the case. The stand is just not stable when the iPad is in landscape orientation, which is what I use most. The weight of the iPad just isn't sufficient to make the base lie flat which makes for a \"\"bouncy\"\" experience when using the iPad's touch screen, often times making the iPad fall out of the groove on the keyboard that keeps it propped up. When in portrait orientation everything is fine, but I rarely want to use my iPad in portrait with a keyboard. I imagine there are better options in the market.\"", "This case has been great in providing protetction for my work Ipad.  It also provides me with a keyboard and is sturdy enough. If you are looking for a case that is thin, sorry not this one. However, if you are a klutz like me, you will appreciate the heftyness and the textured cover that allows you to grip your ipad with confidence. I work retail land this case allows me to easily carry this around at work and the swivel option is excellent.", "I really like this cover for my iPad.  It fits well and the fact that it has 3 levels of adjustment is a real plus.  I had no problems getting the iPad into the cover.  I can still use all the functionalities with the cover on.  The cover doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk.  The closure on the cover does not hold when it gets bounced or bumped too much - that's the only complaint that I have.  All in all, the product is a good solution for protecting my iPad and improving the function with the built in stand.", "\".iPad keyboards seem to be full compromises. They have more keys accessible at once, including arrow keys, tab key, etc. That's worth a lot. But the cramped layout slows me down, and also Apple's auto-correct, auto-capitalize, and dictation don't work when an external keyboard is active.This is a solid keyboard with some nice features and some flaws.PROs:- A solid keyboard with lots of special-purpose keys along the top.- Good battery life- Rotation to portrait or landscape mode.CONs:- Fixed angle - no angle adjustments- Landscape mode is too vertical (see Note 1)- OK for use on a desk or table, but not on your lap. iPad is too upright, and also is easily jostled from the slot (tips over).- No magnetic sleep-wake- Targus recommends turning iPad's \"\"Cover Lock-unlock\"\" OFF (see Note 2)- - - Alternatives - - -I haven't tried any others. Apparently the following are worth a look:-Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover (920-004013)-New Trent IMP38B Airbender ClamShell Keyboard Case- - - Notes - - -Note 1: No angle adjustment: In portrait mode, iPad is held at 54 degrees from horizontal -- about right. In landscape mode it's more upright -- 65 degrees from horizontal -- maybe too vertical for most people. (Straight up = 90 degrees from horizontal.)Note 2: User Manual: \"\"To optimize battery life, of your iPad, make sure that the iPad Cover Lock/Unlock option in the settings menus is set to OFF. This will keep the iPad from being accidentally awoken by a key press during transit.\"\"\"", "This Targus keyboard case has many fantastic features, but they are rendered moot if you prefer to view your iPad in landscape mode: the viewing angle is too close to 90 degrees to make it easily seen if the iPad is at comfortable typing level.First, the good and the excellent:  I love the feel of the keyboard.  Although it's obviously smaller than a normal one, it feels big enough and responsive enough to make typing comfortable.  I also like (in theory) the design that allows you to rotate the iPad from landscape to portrait and back again on a pivot without rearranging the configuration of the stand.  The groove in the keyboard is deep enough to provide a stable base for the device.  Targus has added a couple of specialty keys that I wasn't sure at first were needed, but once I got used to them, I liked them, especially the one that locks/turns off the screen with a tap.  Cut, paste, search, and volume buttons are useful even if they aren't essential.  The elastic strap that keeps the cover closed is thick and tight, and it keeps the iPad in place and covers the rear camera hole to protect the lens.Now, the bad:  a single viewing angle wouldn't be bad if both orientations yielded the same, slightly upward facing view.  But they don't.  While the portrait orientation gives a nice, upward facing angle, the landscape mode looks almost as though it's facing the keyboard instead of the user.  (This is an optical illusion because the user is above it and looking down, but still.)  To me, that's inexcusable for an iPad design since many of us switch from watching video straight into, say, web searches or word processing that use a keyboard.  The other disadvantage of this keyboard case is its thickness and weight.  At its widest end, it is an inch thick.  According to my kitchen scale, it weighs 1 lb 3 oz -- almost as much as the iPad itself.  I could deal with the extra weight and thickness if I could use it in landscape modeI, but since I have to lean backward to get a good view, those specs just add more inconvenience.  Strangely, the keyboard on/off switch is located behind the propped up iPad, so if you forget to turn it on before you position the device, you have to either reach behind or lift up the iPad to get to it.According to the box, this keyboard case is designed for the new iPad; I don't know why the iPad 2 isn't also compatible since it has the same dimensions and exterior design.I cannot recommend this to anyone except those who do most of their iPad use in portrait orientation.  Yes, it's easier to work on documents in portrait, but it's a a pain to have a case that is not versatile enough to let me also watch a movie.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "I have been using this case and keyboard since May 17, 2012, so I've had about 3 full months for evaluation. I have used it with both the iPad 2nd Gen and now with the new iPad 3rd Gen 32 GB model. After extensive personal testing, I find that this case works very well for me.I love how thick the stain resistant padded exterior is and, though a bit on the heavier side for a case, I feel that this offers an added layer of protection against the hard wear and tear (including dropping) that transporting and constant use can cause. I really enjoy the 360 degree rotation that allows me to view the iPad in both portrait and landscape modes while sitting securely in the slotted area of the keyboard. I prefer the portrait mode because the viewing angle seems superior, but I'm certain that is wholly a personal predilection. You can't really use the keyboard very well unless you're on a flat surface as the device will slip out of the keyboard slot fairly easily.To tell you the truth, I wasn't that crazy about my iPad until I finally got this keyboard case. I can't say enough positive things about the QWERTY, low-profile Bluetooth keyboard. The keys are a good size and I have no difficulty with speedy typing. I also noticed that the typing experience is very quiet, unlike with some other users I've heard nearby with different keyboards. The only irritant to me is that I often hit the return key when I want to hit the apostrophe! I like all the special function keys too! The keyboard holds its charge for a long time, but the port to charge it can be accessed without opening the case as it has slots for ease of connecting. There is also an aperture for the camera and the speaker output.In addition, I really like the clip for holding my stylus and the soft touch interior. The only thing missing is a little pouch or slot on the inside to perhaps hold a business card or perhaps a screen cleaning cloth. Last but not least, I like the elastic band that comes along the outside to hold the two sides of the case together securely. It is not magnetic off/on, and I don't need that, but if you are looking for that feature, be advised.I would give this 4+ stars. My issues will always be that I will have to find a place to put the charging cords! It is not a small case, either, but I think that is more of a positive thing for me. I recommend it for its looks, ease and pleasure of use, and for its protection.", "\"I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate typing on smart phones and the IPAD.  My fingers are too big and it really is an exercise in frustration.  Well,this is exactly what the doctor ordered and it worked right out of the box.  The keyboard is not like a high quality PC keyboard or even quite as solid as a laptop keyboard, but it works really well and does the trick.  The keys have reasonable \"\"bounce\"\" and the blue tooth was effortless to set up (simply turn on your IPAD blue tooth in settings and after a short prompt you're on your way).  If you're not familiar, Targus is a decent quality brand.  The actually keyboard comes in a folder-like case and props for convenience while you're typing.  Big warning: this is for the latest generation IPAD and because Apple decided to be difficult, it won't fit older IPADs.  With this said, it's only the plastic case that holds the IPAD upright.  The blue tooth and keyboard will work with any blue tooth device including older IPADs.  You'll just need to prop up the IPAD or even just lie it flat on top.  This is hardly the fault of Targus and I still give the product two thumbs up (and the rest of the fingers on the keyboard!So if you're looking for a good wireless keyboard for a wireless portable blue device, this is a great choice.  It's already a hit in my household.\"", "Summary:  This self-contained keyboard case is a nice option for the those who need to type long emails or documents on the iPad.  Learn to use the shortcuts in the top row of keys.Pros:- Keyboard size is large enough for QWERTY typing of letters- Typing is responsive--no discernible delay between typing and the characters appearing on screen- iPad immediately recognizes when the keyboard is turned on.- Rechargeable battery has long life- Viewing angle in portrait mode is fine (note: there is only 1 viewing angle option)- Top row of shortcuts are very useful--reduce a lot of necessary screen touching.- Substantial/durable case that closes and stays closed nicelyCons:- Landscape mode is too upright for most- Some characters/punctuation has been shifted inward on the keyboard to save space (e.g. question mark, apostrophe, brackets).", "This is a great little keyboard with function keys that would almost make an iPad into a workable small laptop for productive work beyond the minimal browsing and light e-mail that many seem satisfied but those people really don't need a separate keyboard.There are some minor issues with the keyboard as other reviewers have noted. The problem of the keyboard indenting the glass I think isn't really an issue but I took the precautionary measure of putting a screen protector on, such asMediaDevil Magic Screen Protector: Matte Clear (Anti-Glare) edition - For Apple iPad 2 / 2nd Generation / the new iPad 3 / 3rd Generation (2 x Screen Protectors).The major issue I have with the Targus keybord is that there doesn't seem to be anyway to lower the angle of the screen. When using the iPad horizontally, the angle is close to 90 degrees... suboptimal for viewing, especially given the need to touch the screen frequently.The iPad has largely turned into an internet radio, web browser and handy calendar. I probably would have been much better off getting a MacBook Air, which is much more functional for the work I do. Of course, the iPad is easier to connect to the internet and the touch screen is nice. When they build those features into the Air, I'll be happy.I probably wouldn't be giving any keyboard 5 stars given my dissatisfaction with the iPad as a workhorse. However, the Targus keyboard... however nice in appearance, fails miserably because of the poor viewing angle.", "First off I've had other cases for the iPad so I'm able to compare this to the cases I've used in the past. The bluetooth keyboard linked up without a hitch to my iPad 3 within a few seconds, the keyboard is on the small side so people with bighands might find this a challenge to use. I love being able to turn the iPad within the case, it will work on end or on its side. The case with my iPad mounted is stable on a table no matter the placement of the screen. It folds up withoutthe keyboard touching the screen, this is a plus. A negative is that this case does NOT put the iPad to sleep when closed like many other cases, I'm sorry Targus missed the boat here as it's always nice to know you're saving battery powerif you forget to sleep the iPad before closing up. The case has a firm hold on the iPad once you snap it into place, not all cases have such a grip. I will add any updates as I spend more time using this good looking quality case from Targus.", "I have tried out a few cases now and this one is OK. I was able to pair the device without isuue and the rotating design actually works better on this case than the originalTargus Versavu. It's a little looser and moves easier. The main issues with this keyboard for me are the viewing angle and the hard to read keys. The viewing angle is very steep. Almost 90. That angle makes it unusable on your lap. Which is where most people use an ipad. It is easier to use at a table but if I'm going to do that I may as well get the laptop. The keys are so hard to see that I need full on light to see them. They are black keys with dim muted white translucent lettering. The black from the keys saps the strength of the white and the letters  just do not stand out. I had eye fatigue using this keyboard. If they would have used an opaque ink when printing the letters on the keys it would have worked much better. White keys with black lettering would have been the best option. I do not type like your supposed to. I'm a hunt and peck kind of typer so the minimal size of the keyboard did not affect me as much as it did for my wife and it's nice to have the directional arrow keys. (I find that finger magnifier built into the iPad iOS to be tedious)Obviously this is not a full sized keyboard and in reality can not be used as such. My wife can type well over 100 words a minute and she found it to be unusable. The home row is so compressed that the movements to any of the other keys is so minimal that she was hitting more than 1 letter at a time. The keys are so sensitive she was getting long strings of letters when pausing. If you come from the manual typing days and I know many people have, you will struggle with the sensitive keys the most.Depending on your needs there are some redeeming qualities to this case.The price is right. A case and a keyboard could easily cost over a hundred bucks. You get both here for under.The compact size is great if your traveling and don't want to lug around a separate keyboard.The swivel design is great!It is built very well. Quite sturdy.If all you need is a compact keyboard that travels well with the iPad then this case is a great option.If you still need to get a screen protector and are short on cash you should check out theCrazyOnDigital case with free screen protectorIt's a decent case for the cash but not my favorite.If you do not need a screen protector I would suggest theTargus Versavu for the New iPadIt's getting a bad rap for the magnetic on/off functionality but I have not seen this feature work flawlessly on any case. Even Apples. It's similar to this case with out the keyboard. I really like the rotating design in this case and use it all the time.In reality, I do not perceive the iPad to be the best solution when a lot of typing in needed. I can't foresee anyone actually choosing this device to type out 200 page essays. It just was never intended for that. But in an emergency or If you absolutely have a need for keyboard functionality I would suggest theApple Wireless Keyboardor theApple Keyboard with Numeric KeypadI received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? No", "This is a great case.  It's as compact as any other ipad case, but when you open it up, there's a built-in bluetooth keyboard.  Synching it with my ipad was a breeze, and it worked right away.  It can be a little bit jarring going from using a regular computer to using the ipad with the keyboard, though, just because the key bindings are different, but it's easy to get used to.  Like the other Targus Versavu cases, the ipad snaps right in (it fit my ipad 2 perfectly) and once in place, it can be rotated into portrait or landscape mode.  My only minor complaint is that, when the ipad is rotated into portrait mode, it gets a bit top heavy - I've clicked a button on the top of the screen and almost knocked it over, since there's nothing to hold it in place on the bottom.  Also, if you put the ipad into airplane mode, bluetooth is disabled and thus so is the keyboard which is sort of a pain once you get used to it and can't use it while you travel.  On the whole, though, this is a great case and the addition of the bluetooth keyboard doesn't add any noticeable weight or bulk.", "This was very nice, but not compatible with my 4th generation iPad. I was disappointed. In the meantime though, I've gotten quite good at using the iPad built in keyboard.", "Preliminary Review:  I'll be traveling with it soon and will add an addendum when I return.I really expected more from Targus.  The concept is good but the execution is not.  If I could rate the keyboard alone, it would get a 4-star rating - while the case would likely get a 1-star grade.As other reviewers have mentioned, the display sits at a good angle when in the portrait position but the landscape angle is almost vertical and almost useless for anything other than viewing slideshows or videos.  So, if you're typing e-mails or other documents in the portrait position, the combination of viewing angle and the nice keyboard are just great.  The picture on the packaging shows the display sitting at the same angle in portrait and landscape positions - wrong!  The next problem comes when you close the case.The plastic shell the iPad is locked into continues to swivel when the case is closed so the iPad WILL come in contact with the keyboard - AND - swiveling in the opposite direction allows the elastic closure band to press on the power / sleep switch.  In some cases, this could turn on your iPad when you don't want it to be on.  If Targus had added detents so the swivel mechanism would lock in the two primary positions, some of the operational issues would be resolved.  There is also no magnet to activate the iPad's magnetic switch that puts the iPad to sleep when you close the case - a real shortcoming.  My Snugg case and other covers have this feature.Bulk - This Case / iPad / Keyboard combination does not make for a slim package.  A Macbook Air would be a far more travel-worthy companion for the heavy e-mail and document-creating traveler.More when I return from travels . . .UPDATE - 8-31-12:  My opinion of this case has not changed after several trips with it.  I used the keyboard but left the iPad in my Snugg case.  Recommendation:  Look for something else.", "Overall, I really like this case. The first concern on any iPad case, in my opinion, is how well it secures and protects the iPad. The iPad snaps in snugly and securely, with ample access to every port and visibility of the full screen. Much better than the cases that use tabs that slip over each corner of the iPad. The keyboard side has two unobtrusive sides that are made of the padded felt so that the face of your iPad is protected from rubbing up against the keys when you close the case. Nice touch.The rotation feature is great. Feels solid and durable, but the viewing angle is best when it's in portrait mode. Speaking of viewing angles, you have one option if you want to use the keyboard, and one option if you don't.  It seems a little limiting at first, but you'll probably just end up using portrait mode for typing functions, and the landscape mode that covers the keyboard for anything wide-screen.The keyboard itself is good. The keyboard is quiet, and has more iPad-specific keys than my full-size bluetooth keyboard does (cut/copy/paste + dedicated media control buttons). Compared to that full-size keyboard, this one does feel a little cramped, but I love the convenience of having everything in one case.  It even has a pen-holder, which is perfect for my combination ink pen/stylus. If they added in a couple of slots for business cards along the back edge, this would be a perfect replacement to carrying a laptop + a portfolio on a business trip.I have only a few minor complaints. The elastic strap that keeps the case closed is a little stiff, making it harder than necessary to secure the case closed.  It'll probably loosen up with repeated use, though, so I'd rather have one that's too tight now and works correctly for the life of the product rather than one that will be too loose most of the time. The downside of the secure grip it has on the iPad is that it's not effortless to pull it out and use the iPad without the case. Finally, the case itself is a bit heavy.", "\"This polyurethane Targus Versavu Keyboard Case is beautiful, with imitation-leather exterior and suede-like \"\"soft touch\"\" interior.  A hard shell (also with imitation-leather exterior) holds the iPad firmly in place, yet the iPad can be easily removed.  The shell is attached at the circular hole shown in the product photos; the hole allows the Apple logo to show through.  The shell rotates (with the iPad inserted) a full 360 degrees, so that the stand and keyboard can be used when the iPad is oriented either horizontally or vertically.The lightweight keyboard is about the same size as the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook.  The flat, non-contoured keys are reasonably comfortable to use.  The keyboard is surrounded by a raised edge, to prevent scratches or damage to the iPad screen.  The keyboard must be charged independently (using the included USB cable, attached to your computer).  The keyboard will give a low-charge warning at 15% power, and shut down at 10% power.This case (with cutouts for buttons, switches, rear camera, and charger plug) fits my iPad 2 perfectly, and the Bluetooth keyboard connects with my iPad 2.  I didn't expect it to work, because the iPad 2 is equipped with Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR technology, while the iPad 3 is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 technology, and the product description says that the case requires an iPad 3.  The case does NOT have an automatic iPad Wake/Sleep switch that operates when you open the cover; however, the keyboard puts itself to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity.I like this case and all of its features, but it's not the \"\"perfect\"\" iPad 2 case.  It adds weight and bulk, and apparently--judging from other reviewers' statements--the manufacturer recommends against using the case for anything but display (no carrying the case around in a backpack, tote, or bag).  Because the keyboard works well, I rate it at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.\"", "Too bulky... One of the iPads selling points is it's slender, light size. This case takes that away. It's just too much like carrying a laptop around. Okay, but no thanks!", "This is a nice case and keyboard with bluetooth. I gace it as a present and it is now not being used as much as thought it would be. I am thinking of selling it if you want to buy...", "I had the same Targus case before this one except that it did not have the bluetooth keyboard built-in. I have used it for several months now and overall I really like it. If anything it was slightly large but for the ability to stand the iPad up at different angles, proved very useful and protective.This new case with keyboard is even thicker and heavier. That is one drawback. The other is that the viewing angle is a bit steep and not adjustable. I hope that as the leather wears in, that it will flex more and relax the iPad to a slightly less vertical angle.Overall I do like the keyboard and the function keys at the top that take you to the home screen, toggle the on-screen keyboard, music transport controls, instant photo slide show, and several other useful functions. I find the battery life of the keyboard to be excellent. You do have to charge it via small USB jack on side of keyboard. Overall 4 stars except for the slightly clunky size and viewing angles.", "I run a business from home and am often on the road. I stopped taking a laptop once the iPad came out since it was so small, lightweight, reliable, fast, and it did everything I needed it to do and more. I hesitated for a long time to get a Bluetooth keyboard because I didn't want to carry a separate component with me, but did end up eventually trying and on long trips usingMotorola Wireless Keyboard with Device Stand - Retail Packaging. The problem is sometimes I would forget it and end up using the iPad virtual keyboard which takes far longer than a real keyboard such as the Motorola and this one.I have most of the Targus cases thanks to Vine and find them to be very good, although my two favorite cases do not have the on/off magnet function on the iPad 3 like most other cases do. This being one of them. I am disappointed that it doesn't have the magnet, but it's not too difficult to just remember to turn it off. If you are very accustomed to having the magnet this case will be frustrating to you. One of my friends started using this same case and had to get rid of it because she couldn't deal with her iPad battery draining because she forgot to turn it off and didn't want to use the iPad auto-lock feature to place the iPad into standby.I love this case and have closed it with leaving the iPad on and the iPad screen does not come into contact with the keyboard. Nonetheless, a screen protector would be a wise idea if using this long term. The iPad snaps in easily and remains secured with all function buttons very easily accessible. The Bluetooth keyboard has an on/off button to save battery and give you the option of using the virtual keyboard instead. I had no trouble pairing the keyboard with the iPad.I love the cut, paste, search, play, volume up & down, mute, and other keyboard functions. I have a normal sized hand and had no trouble typing accurately, although it's obviously not a full sized keyboard so your functions will be limited and your typing speed slower than a desktop keyboard.I didn't find the case to be too bulky. If you NEED a keyboard this is the way to go. I love it and use it daily for emails, so much easier than the virtual keyboard that cannibalizes half the screen, and so much faster than the virtual keyboard.A note about the use of the keyboard in your lap & landscape vs. portrait. I did use this at a restaurant in landscape mode for a game, and had no trouble using it that way. I propped a spoon under the keyboard to improve the viewing angle. In general, I prefer portrait mode for emails (which for me is what the keyboard is for) so I don't mind that portrait is the better viewing mode. For people looking to buy this case that don't do a serious amount of emailing or other typing intensive work, this will be a burden (size, weight, bulk, price, etc) so consider your needs to determine if this is your best choice. I keep this and a couple of other cases on my nightstand so depending upon what I need to do that day determines which case I use.", "Targus makes some great problem-solvers for us mobile workers.Their products tend to be very practical, with aesthetics at best a 'meh' compared to a Belkin or Logitiech solution - but they do seem to understand mobile worker needs and get unique solutions to market quickly.I can't recommend this product - its more expensive and less usable than comparable solutions.The two main issues with this case are the landscape viewing angle (as others have mentioned, its nearly 90, making it unusable on a lap - but even if the angle was better the construction wouldn't be stable enough anyway) and the security of the ipad in the mount - mine keeps popping out.I'm not a fan of the case either, its too bulky, dont like the logo hole.That said, if you get the ipad seated properly and set up on a desk directly in front of you, the viewing angle is tolerable and the keyboard works extremely well for its size. I typed up an entire document on it on my desk today and it worked very well. But I need it to work on my lap as well.", "I admit to being a TARGUS fan, but this is really special.No matter what anyone says, you REALLY DO need to get a keyboard to make full, productive use of your iPad, and of course you need a case to protect it.  This solves that issue, with style and ease of use.  I have had more than a few admiring glances when using this, with people asking where to get one...I think this would be a perfect gift new to tablets, and perhaps to touch screens.  For example, many seniors will immediately get more use out of the iPad with the keyboard option enabled -it just makes things easier, and more familier.This is something that you will use daily! A perfect gift, perhaps for yourself. You deserve it!", "This case looks and works great. It provides good protection for your tablet and a nice keyboard too. It is a little thicker than some other cases, but it would seem to be a fair tradeoff for better protection.", "The item arrived warped, which did not help the first impression.  I found it to be too bulky.  I expected it to have some bulk, with it having a keyboard in it, but not nearly how much it added in weight to my ipad.  The keyboard was easy to set up and use.  I found it very convenient for use on the keyboard.  I did not like the way the ipad sits when it is upright in this case.  Found it very awkward.", "\"I test with the iPad2 32G and I can report that everything works just the same as with the iPad 3 (which I also briefly tested it on and found absolutely no differences).  Cut, paste, copy, and all of the music and photo controls are nice and work perfectly on both.  So iPad2 users, do go ahead and buy, but only if you prefer to do things mostly in portrait mode.As other reviewers have mentioned, this has a seriously vertical viewing angle when propped in the included \"\"trench\"\" in landscape mode, making it really odd to look at the screen.  Personally, I kept wanting to put it on the keyboard itself to view, and if they would only put some tiny ridges in the side of the keyboard, one could do this easily without it sliding.  I *think* that with increased use or with a heavy stylus in the back of the case for a while, this viewing angle will actually normalize, since it's a problem of the back not really touching the ground.  The way it \"\"stands\"\" now, though, is kind of off-putting and since I have a case I enjoy using with great viewing angles, I don't think this is the one for me.In all, I will be sticking with the combo of theBelkin Cinema Dot Folio with Stand for New Apple iPad 2 / 3rd Generation, HD, 1080P, WiFi, 4G LTE, AT & T, Verizon (Black/Grey)and throwing theIncase CL57575 Origami Stand Sleeve for Apple iPad and iPad 2, Blackwith theApple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION] in my bag when I need to type.  HOWEVER, considering that the wireless keyboard alone is almost the price of this case, you might want to think about putting up with the viewing angle issues and trying out this little case if you like a traditional keyboard.  The shortcut keys are nifty and at this price point, it feels far more expensive than it is.\"", "Overall, this keyboard case is excellent.  While it's primary function is to essentially make your ipad and a keyboard feel like one product (the ipad snaps into the case and then the case unfolds so that the keyboard almost looks like an extension of your ipad), it also provides a decent level of protection from everyday wear-and-tear.I have to admit that I always balk at the price of items like these, but if you can accept that anything like an ipad case with a built-in keyboard will cost way more than it should...this is a product I would generally recommend.  The keyboard behaves well, and if you're typing emails or notes or whatever, I think it really saves you a LOT of time compared to using the electronic keypad.  Maybe it's just my age (48), but I still like the feel of a real keyboard where I'm comfortable know my fingers have actually hit a key.It's not perfect, though.  The case unfolds and allows you to prop up your ipad so that coupled with the keyboard, it feels like a little notebook computer.  But you can only prop it at a couple of angles.  It allows minimum flexibility and if the light is hitting your ipad at an bad angle, your only option is to endure or to stop using the keyboard.  If you're sitting around in a less that perfect position (like laying on a couch)...it can be tough to get the ipad and keyboard to sit at a position ideal for you.  This is pretty minor, overall.  You can always fold the keyboard out of the way and just use the ipad on its own.  Save your heavy keyboard needs for when you more ideally situated at a desk or table.The case itself probably will get a bit beat up.  It protects the ipad, yes, but it is itself vulnerable to scratching and dings.  But if you really want or need a product like this...it will serve you well.  I cannot judge the usefulness of a keyboard for anyone else, but if you think it would be quite useful to you...the Targus is a good pick.", "\"On the whole, the Versavu Keyboard for iPad 3 is not a bad product - IF it cost $30 like many of the others on Amazon. Sadly, at over $80 this is just not an acceptable product, especially from a brand like Targus, who are normally behind some good quality gear.The concept is nice - a rotating case inside a leather pouch, with a Bluetooth rechargeable keyboard. Sadly, they missed many options to make this a better product - for starters, the elastic strap to lock the case shut is lousy - and on mine, already feels like the band is about to break. Secondly, it lacks sleep magnets to turn the iPad on/off when you open the case.The swivel is a decent idea, but in reality, it just means that the iPad is loose and swivels around a bit. Also, they added a stylus pocket, but with a pen in the pocket, the iPad can no longer rotate.The case is sold as \"\"for iPad 3rd generation\"\", but since nothing major changed between the iPad 2 and the 3, there is no reason to invest in a special iPad 3 case, and many of the $30 Keyboard cases on Amazon should work just fine.And finally, it lacks multiple angles - the iPad goes in at a far to high angle to be used efficiently. There are plenty of other cases that have more effort put into their design. Sadly, this is one of the first poorly designed products I've seen from Targus, and can only recommend against it.\"", "This is a great case - easy to use, sync with bluetooth is automatic (after it's initially turned on) and it is sturdy. The keyboard is pretty decent with nearly full size shift keys - and important feature for folks who are fast touch typists. Small shift keys often result in the pinky extending too far and deleting text - a real aggravation.The quality seems pretty decent and it has stood up well for several weeks on the road.The only issue is that there is only one angle for the device to be propped up but that's typical of this style case."], "Gamma": [0.03127479925751686, 0.03358523175120354, 0.03330684080719948,
