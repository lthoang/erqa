"], "reviews": ["What a refreshing surprise!  Every once in a while I run into a coffe I would go out of my way to have. This is one of those times.  There is no bitterness but a distinct desirable unique coffee flavor. If you want to taste coffee and not just blitz yourself with a caffeine high give this a shot.", "\"Brown Gold's 100% Ethiopian ground coffee has a very interesting blend of flavors, with a fruitiness to it, but mostly, what I get as an aftertaste, is similar the square of 100% cocoa I eat every day. It's nice hot, but even nicer I think cold. Makes a really great glass of iced coffee, and with the Spring and Summer months not far off, I will be enjoying my iced 100% Ethiopian by Brown Gold. Yum.This ground coffee is labeled \"\"Bold,\"\" and has a marvelous aroma, and one whiff will tell the buyer that this coffee is not for those that like the weak and watery stuff. I like my coffee strong, and make it in aPrimula Tempo Coffee Press 6 Cup - BlackSince I only have one cup a day, I like to make sure it's the real thing. And for the price, Brown Gold's 100% Ethiopian is a very good contender for the Real Thing.\"", "\"My husband and I tried this coffee after being used to fresh ground beans (this coffee is pre-ground.)  The first pot was a bit of a trial and ended up being too strong for us, however, I firmly believe it was user error and not the fault of the product.  When I made our second pot, I used a bit less, and it was delicious.  I actually hadn't told my husband I switched and he said, out of the blue, \"\"I don't know what you did differently, but the coffee was delicious this morning.\"\"  I would definitely purchase this product again.\"", "This certainly was a surprise, it has a nice bold taste that everyone noticed from the very first morning brew! Though no stronger than the most familiar coffee, the bold taste is interesting, the packaging nice and coffee from Ethiopia quite unique! The whole family enjoys this coffee.In our house, we use a different brand almost every day (just for variety) and this is always picked up on and it gets two thumbs up from me!The price is reasonable and I will certainly buy this product in the future.I have to say... this coffee could catch on and become a supermarket favorite!", "I wasn't all that impressed with this coffee. It was just okay, probably a little less flavorful than the cheap, grocery-store brand of coffee you can get from the store. The taste was almost bland with no real body, and it actually tasted a little stale, like it had been sitting around and lost flavor. On a good note, it was smooth and not too acidic. If you like standard corner restaurant coffee, then this will be fine, but otherwise I would skip it.", "This coffee has good flavor and a nice caffeine kick. It's not the best coffee I've ever had, but it's pretty good. I didn't notice the bitter flavor that some coffees have. The package does say that the coffee has citrus and green tea notes, but I can't taste any of that--perhaps I just don't have a discerning enough palate! Overall, I'm very happy with this coffee and would buy it in the future.", "I loved the flavor of this coffee. First I smelled it before it was made and it was rich with floral tones. I usually like weaker coffee but this one charmed me with a bitter after taste, no acid stomach after drinking it. This will definitely be one of my most favorite coffees. The price is the same as other well-known coffees but it will be so convenient to get it through Amazon.com.I highly recommend this coffee.", "This Ethiopian coffee was among the worst I have had in a long time. It seemed to be  both stale and had some kind of off almost moldy taste. The store brand I sometimes buy for $2.50 a can is better.", "I really enjoyed the smoothness and richness of this coffee.  My husband complained of a slight bitterness, but my palate couldn't detect those notes,  Overall, a decent coffee, but we won't be switching to this brand.", "I was very pleased to try this coffee. It fills your taste buds with a delicate floral sweetness, is aromatic and full of flavor. I happen to like it better than the average drips you can purchase at the coffee shop. Highly recommended and I am not even a coffee person!", "I love coffee and varieties of coffee, so I'm not locked in to any one specific kind. I like my coffee strong and Brown Gold definitely delivered there. It was stronger than the typical coffee that I buy, a plus. If you don't like strong, bold coffee, then you're probably better off getting something else. My biggest disappointment with this coffee was the overall flavor. It felt like the depth of flavor was just missing. It's strong, bitter, but one note and just left me wanting a bit more. Pricing isn't bad...pretty comparable to other middle of the road coffees.Overall, this Brown Gold isn't bad - I'd drink it again - I just wouldn't go out of my way to get it.", "\"As someone else already noted, reviewing coffee is very subjective.  So, in order to help you understand where I'm coming from:  I like my coffee strong, but I'm not a fan of Turkish style coffee.  I prefer Cappuccino over Cafe Latte.  And I love fair trade Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee.This stuff is NOT fair trade Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.  Labeling it simply \"\"Ethiopian\"\" is an easy tip off that the coffee isn't top-shelf, up to snuff.  But beyond the label:\"\"Brown Gold\"\" has seriously over roasted this coffee.  Yes, it makes for a strong smelling and very dark coffee, but over roasting also kills flavor and caffeine.  So, this stuff looks and smells bold, but it's bitter.  I don't know where they get all this chatter of floral nose, and citrus and green tea notes... the roasting process has destroyed any subtle flavors that were once there.For best results, make a strong pot of coffee (6 scoops to 4 or 5 cups of water) and then add water once it's done to suit your taste.This isn't horrible coffee.  It's good, just not great.\"", "As advertised, Brown Gold 100% Ethiopian has a unique floral aroma; a medium roast that has delicate notes of citrus and green tea. It is not for those who fill their brew with lots of sweeteners or cream, as this would destroy the point of the coffee. Full body, nice compliment to lighter fare.I tried this both as a single cup drip, and in a French Press and have to say I was very impressed. For a pre-ground coffee it managed to maintain some of the delicate flavors, and doesn't depend on a dark roasting to bring the flavors forward. Whole bean would probably maintain better, and give even more enjoyment.", "My wife is the coffee drinker in the family, not me. She liked the 100% Ethiopian coffee, and says it has a good, solid taste. Nothing spectacular about it, but no complaints either.", "Overall, the coffee is fine.  Not great, but better than others I've bought.  The label described a citrus flavor, and similar to any other coffee (or wine for that matter) I never really taste these descriptions.  However, even before seeing the citrus notes I kind of felt the coffee was a little too much on the acidic side. It made me wonder if citrus is code for acidic...Still, I enjoyed the coffee, more than some others that I currently have.  We finished the bag relatively quickly so that must say something.  I would be interested in trying another version of their single source coffee.", "Brown Gold; 100% Ethiopian coffee has a wonderful full-bodied taste in my opinion. I liked the idea and concept behind the what coffee being washed in cold press utilizing less water then the counterparts that are out there trying to make a world of difference in keeping our planet Green.I'm not a chemist or a coffee bean grower so I don't know if this is truly a green process but when I read everything about this company and their processing procedure it made sense to me. It didn't taste very good to me and it did have a wonderful taste. I am a person who likes a very strong tasting black coffee. No cream no sugar just straight up mug of coffee. I think the Being was in there and it did not have any adversarial side effects.I hope this review has been helpful and that you might give it a try. I do think the price was a little high but for special occasions it's nice to treat yourself with something you enjoy.Try this coffee you may like it if you don't then at least you An open mind for your purchase. Good luck!", "Brown gold is a solid morning coffee.  It has a rich, slightly earthy flavor and definitively gets the caffeine levels up to the operating minimums.  There are coffees I like better, but I won't turn my nose up at this one.", "I enjoy my coffee strong, similar to Starbucks coffee,  This coffee met my expectations.  I brewed it in my reusable k cup and found it to be a nice strong and bold flavor.  Brown Gold's Ethiopian blend makes an excellent choice for a daily coffee.", "I don't normally like coffee. I'm more of a tea drinker personally since I usually can't stand the taste of coffee.  Some time ago I had some Marley Brand Ethiopian coffee and I loved it!  It was one of the few coffees that I could stomach the taste of.  Unfortunately, it's also rather pricey, so I haven't had any more since.When I got the chance to try some Ethiopian coffee from a different brand I jumped at the chance!  I opened up the back once I'd gotten it and took a whiff.  It's got quite a pleasant smell to it!  I brewed myself a pot immediately and I really liked the taste.  It's got a bit less of that bitterness that you find in other coffees.  I tried brewing it weaker than recommended after that and I liked it even better.  Of course, anyone who actually likes the taste of coffee is going to want to brew this at regular strength, but it worked for me.  Anyway, this coffee is much better priced than the Marley brand, so if you like Ethiopian coffee you might as well give this a try!", "\"Right off the bat, I am a Devoted Coffee Drinker, probably I could be considered an addict!I just love it when Vine offers a product like this for us to try. Surely this is the finest and best way to get a good item like this great coffee the circulation and attention that it deserves, so that we may then \"\"safely\"\" order it and know we will be enjoying it.My personal favorite coffees are usually Sumatran, Kenyan, Ethiopian, Somalian, Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and Indonesian-Javanese grown beans. Occasionally, there is Kona, sometimes a Yukon blend. As most coffee lovers know, each of these are truly unique unto themselves, and each is always a welcome change that will bring a satisfied smile to your face...every time!This coffee is sure to please even the most demanding drinker. It is dark and rich, full-bodied with a mellow overtone to it. Smooth certainly would describe it also. It ranks right up there with the finest imported brands of beans.I grant it 5-stars easily--as it is that good. Would I order it regularly? You Bet! (and I will be ordering it frequently here....there is always something truly special when you get your mail, and it contains a pleasurable treat like this.)If you are a coffee drinker, I highly recommend this truly great Ethiopian to you.....you'll surely enjoy it!~operabruin\"", "I've had other Ethiopian coffee blends and somewhat know what to expect.  I was surprised that it didn't have the strong aroma when you first open the bag like other coffees do, but the coffee itself when brewed properly has a strong robust flavor.  Overall, it's an average coffee and I probably wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.", "I like all kinds of coffee -different roasts and preparation methods. I made this in French press and tried it black and with a little milk and sugar. This is a decent coffee. Nothing about it really stands out but I have nothing bad to say about it either. It is just a middle of the road coffee that wont wow coffee lovers but won't offend either. A 3.5 star product.", "The first time I made this coffee, I followed the directions--which calls for double the scoops I'm used to using--and it was way too strong for me. Once I made a more management pot of it, I enjoyed the unique, somewhat sweet flavor from the citrus and tea leaves, but it's not something I'd want to drink daily. It's not a bad coffee, but also not something that will be high on my coffee shopping list either.", "To be fair, this is the first bag of Ethopian I have had so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I typically prefer a dark bold roast, something like Major Dickason's or an 'Espresso' ground.  I prepared this in an instant coffee maker just as I do with any other brand.  Drink it black.  The flavor was a little on the weak side and the aftertaste was suprisingly bitter.  And not a good bitter.  It didn't really follow the weakness in the flavor well.  Might do better if you prepare it in a french press where you can control the brew time/amount of grounds better.", "I would have given this a negative review had I stopped drinking the coffee after my first swallow.  It had a hard to describe aroma but it wasn't like the typical strong fair trade coffee that I like to brew.  I persevered through my first cup.  It has a bitter taste and it lacked the bold coffee flavor that I like.  I believe the description of this item on the website says that it has a flowery or citrus flavor.  I did not taste these flavors.  I tasted a light bitter coffee.  Interestingly enough, I started to enjoy the bitter flavor and went on to finish that first pot.  This is not something I would typically buy.  It was definitely a good change of pace and I enjoy trying new coffees.", "Coffee and I have a long standing relationship. For years , I would drink only coffee made at home , I then tired of that and would stop at Speedway on the way to work. That got really expensive after a while , so I wanted to get back to the home prep.Wanting to try something different , I discovered this brew and have been very happy since. A very smooth , citrus-tinged blend , with a great aroma , this Brown Gold has made home prep rewarding again.", "I found this coffee to have medium acidity and relatively low bitterness, giving it a mellow flavor. The grind is a medium grind, coarse enough for percolators, but suitable for drip brewers. Coffee lovers who want a rich flavor but one that still has acidity and a little bite will enjoy this.", "When you buy coffee at $7.48/12 oz, you do not expect the world's very best coffee.  (The best will be at LEAST four times this price.)For its price, this is an excellent product.  It has a robust flavor, though I did not detect its advertised citrus/green tea undertones as I drank it -- however, about 15 minutes later there was a sort of green-tea-ish aftertaste on my palate.I cannot say I like it better than what I normally drink in that price range -- but here we are getting into individual quirks rather than quality of product.  When you buy this Brown Gold Ethiopian coffee, you are getting what you can expect for this price with a full-bodied flavor.", "This Ethiopian coffee is a really nice blend of coffee if you like a darker roast.  I gave the coffee four out of five stars for several reasons:The first is my own personal bias (which exists in whoever is reviewing the coffee).  I personally prefer the lighter South American Roasts and so my personal bent is towards those, however, I really liked this blend.  It was not overpowering in its taste, which normally would bother me.The second reason I only gave it four stars is because it did not blow away all the other coffees that I have had (again another preference and this is personal).  It was a good roast and I enjoyed it, but I did not find it alot better than any other coffee that I have had.If your a dark roast kind of person I think you will enjoy this roast, it is dark and strong, but not too strong so that it overpowers you.  It also provided me a great pick me up in the morning.  I liked this dark roast because it was a great balance of coffee taste without being overpoweringly strong.", "This coffee isn't going to blow your socks off, but then, it isn't going to deplete your bank account either.  It is a nice, everyday coffee.  The flavor is rich and smooth, somewhat bold without being overpowering.  The aroma is very nice.  It isn't for those who want a light roast but I think it will fit the bill for most coffee drinkers.  I didn't get that described green tea quality but then, maybe that is just my tastebuds.It comes already ground which means that you don't get to choose your own degree of grind and that it will go stale more quickly.  And while grinding your own beans is nice, this one works just fine in my drip-style coffee pot.  Of course, it is easier than grinding your own beans; there's a trade-off for everything.All in all, this is a coffee that is great for that everyday morning pot of coffee, something to go back to after the more exotic, and more expensive kinds have been tried.", "Note: this review is for the Brown Gold Ethiopian coffee, not any of the other varieties on this Amazon page.The title to this review characterizes my reaction after brewing some of this coffee and tasting it. There was essentially no coffee flavor to the stuff. Instead I had a nondescript hot brown beverage. Curious, I reopened the bag and took a sniff. Even with my nose thrust into the bag, bare inches away from the ground coffee, the aroma was faint and anemic. For comparison, I opened a bag of Peet's Coffee (Major Dickason's blend) I had nearby. The contrast was huge, with the Peet's smelling rich and strong and delicious, the way coffee is supposed to. And this in spite of the fact that my Peet's Coffee was whole beans rather than ground.I wonder if I got a bag that's been sitting on a back shelf in a warehouse for 8 or 10 years -- that's what it tastes and smells like.", "This is an amazing coffee!!!  I love a bold, strong coffee, but too many times that seems to mean that it has a bitter flavor.  This has no bitter flavor, it is just strong and smooth and wonderful. I don't have that discriminating of a palate, I cant tell you about its citrus and green tea notes, but I can tell you that if you like a strong, well-flavored coffee with no bitterness, you should definitely try this one."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.032237984240055084, 0.030151722952723503, 0.030112063512206078, 0.03629033640027046, 0.031503114849328995, 0.027455108240246773, 0.029927760362625122, 0.03305791690945625, 0.03447742015123367, 0.02906358614563942, 0.030816391110420227, 0.03026103414595127, 0.03263715282082558, 0.035479702055454254, 0.03452878072857857, 0.03405766934156418, 0.028922731056809425, 0.033010102808475494, 0.030675645917654037, 0.024434003978967667, 0.03358834609389305, 0.029065655544400215, 0.030196409672498703, 0.03093869239091873, 0.024896081537008286, 0.032094668596982956, 0.03384886309504509, 0.03434203192591667, 0.028930788859725, 0.02858266979455948, 0.030813179910182953, 0.03360239416360855]]}
