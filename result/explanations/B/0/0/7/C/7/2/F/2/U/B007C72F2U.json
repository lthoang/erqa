The religions themselves do not really mean anything.  In fact when you qualify to found a religion you can pick any religion and even rename one to make your own.  The real impact here is the political aspect.  Religon can really influence how other players treat you.  It adds a whole new dynamic to the game.Spies:  Sure there have been spies before but not really like this.  Spies have been completely overhauled and now are much more useful over the long term.  Like religion this adds another layer that will keep you busy.New Civs: What is a Civ expansion without new civs?  There are some fun ones in here.  Each has their own buildings and units.  You really can't complain about new civs.Is it worth the $30 price tag?The price is why this is a four and not a five star product.  It is a little expensive for an expansion pack that only makes a few adjustments.  However if you are a Civ fan this expansion will breathe new life into the game for you.", "I used to be a game addict. So deep in the video junk, the countdown to release could be a nail-biting, room-pacing, saliva-brewing torture.Beyond the Swordsuper expansion forSid Meier's Civilization IVwas my last bad game craving, my first Civ on Steam.Might be unfair to jump from there into *Gods and Kings*, the not-quite-as-super expansion for Civ 5. Espionage, religion, and advanced diplomacy were either part of Civ IV or added in BTS. They should have carried over to core Civ 5. Fortunately the latter gave as much as it took: hex-based tactics, Great Tile Improvements and Natural Wonders, culture purchases, and City States... given in principle. In execution Civ V was shaky, and execution is what gods and kings are about.--Installation and Performance--Amazon Vine sent me the DVD of the game. Like the core title it will load to Steam (see my Civ V reviews for benefits and hazards). No user key and no massive patch to keep me from jumping into the game. I installed G&K; on my custom Intel rig: an i5-2500 quad core with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM, all games running off a 1 TB 6 Gb/s hard drive. My video card is a Radeon HD 6800 series. I did not test this pack with integrated graphics.Civ V had been patched long before this expansion, allowing it to boot faster and run farther before texture popping. G&K; continues the boost and looks terrific in DX 11. On my custom giant map I can explore half the world and reach the Renaissance before I have to turn down graphic options due to tiles washing out. Saves, loads, and turns all move swiftly while the map is able to scroll without stuttering.A new problem arose. Sometimes the GUI console will flicker out of existence, disabling the commands and leaving me with a pretty but untouchable map. This usually happened when I was loading and reloading frequently. Also, the game flat-out froze and crashed on me twice. This remains a significant improvement over Civ IV BTS, which suffered hideous memory leaks and turn crashes. Better programming, or the intervention of Gods and Kings?--Religion--Between the two executives, Gods are the big addition.In Civ4, religions boosted science to reach religions. So long as you climbed the tech tree you could rack up holy cities and swamp the world in psalms. Piety also took part in Civics to influence strategy. Mostly, religion brought gold, science and culture bonuses--especially if you had more than one holy city. Otherwise the faiths had no difference beyond their names and icons.G&K; introduces a different competition where civilizations accumulate Faith: to found a pantheon, to generate Great Prophets, to found religions.  Only one Religion may be founded per civ, preventing the ever-expanding theocracy in the previous title. Pantheons and Religions are customized from a long list of first-come, first-serve beliefs. Each belief has a unique effect, so the motivation of the players is to beat each other out for tenants which best match their strategy.Right off the bat this creates more character.  Faith points accumulate and spend just like culture, so players can buy missionaries and Prophets to spread their rival vision. Not all Beliefs benefit overseas missions, so religion spamming is less useful. Rising costs also keeps missionaries from flooding the map. Because missionaries and prophets have the unique ability to enter closed borders in peace time, place an Inquisitor near your city to defend it against heresy. Finally, faith can be spent on other Great People with the appropriate Social Policy. Overall, I prefer G&K; religion to BTS because it creates a gameable distinction from science.--A Spy is Born--Partly because you can spend Faith on secular options, religion works into the late game. Otherwise it becomes unnoticed in the bustle of civilization growth. Enter the Espionage.Like missionaries, Civ4 could flood the map with agents. Spies in 5 are only granted to the player once per era beginning with the Renaissance. If killed, a new spy eventually spawns. Regardless of whether they succeed, Spies amount to lines of text in an Espionage window. This is informative, but your agent provocateurs should still be provocative units, bought with espionage points, and including a Great Spy. This keeps the mechanic consistent with Religion. Finally, a Spy could succeed the Scout unit in the mid-game. Alas, I must use missionaries to tresspass.Spy missions are also competitive. Your spooks steal or defend technology from rivals, uncover intrigue, or influence city states. Each course has a gathering effect on the campaign. Capping out at six spies, players will also have to juggle missions; you can't generate agents other than to advance the ages.--Truffles from Brussels!--Agents can deepen the city-state strategy. One of the most nettlesome uses of the spy is to rig elections or launch coups to win clients. Poor nations can vex rich nations this way, since spy missions cost time instead of coin. Financially impoverished players can also compete though the revamped City requests: they can generate culture, science or faith instead of bribes. Probably most important to me, many City State requests now have a time limit. Whether unable or unwilling to perform a mission, don't worry because it will simply be refreshed.City states matter more because they provide bigger bonuses, increasing the benefactor's growth and reducing their dependency on diplomacy. Early in the game, coming into contact with a Religious City can reverse the race for pantheons. The also-new Mercantile City helps my rivals keep books in the black and their feet in the race.Nevertheless, I could still collect alliances and use Patronage polices to score cheap Victories.--Call to Power--I won two games on Prince difficulty for this review. Both turned out differently, but also showed off differences from the core title.Right away the AI opponents are more powerful. Even with 22 civs rubbing elbows, many stayed close on my heels. I significantly outpaced the AI in Culture and Production. They usually built huge militaries, settled vast areas, and spread more religion. The A.I never lingered more than two ages behind, and usually hounded my technological heels no matter how much of a head I got from research boosts. Contrast this with the equivalent campaigns in BTS, where rivals smothered beneath my combined weight, their Medieval armies overshadowed by my Stealth Bombers.G&K; is also supposed to increase the heft of combat. World War I tanks, aircraft, and infantry are the big addition. Unfortunately, the AI seldom made use of the new naval unit type, vessels that can take cities from the sea. Because melee ships are faster and stronger than embarked units, they make swift coastal campaigns. Yet the computer kept fleets in deep water, reluctant to attack.Armies were more inconsistent, penetrating deep against ancient cities, only to freeze at the gates of a new colony. I watched a Persian Infantry unit, backed by two Machine Guns, allow itself to be bombarded to death by a 1 pop city. As tedious as it was inexplicable. And when it ended, the MGs picked up and left as quietly as they came.If peace is any compensation, the international diplomacy tightened up. Most civilizations are not as quick to condemn you as a warmonger or slow to make declarations of friendships. It is now possible to maintain partners well into the late game before degenerating into the usual storm of denouncements. Civilizations still have a chance to backstab each other; for the most part their motivations are as transparent as in BTS: such as border tensions, opposing social policies, and proselytizing. G&K; offers more opportunities to affect relations through embassies and espionage. BTS didn't make room to score brownie points.Still, Civ 5 Diplomacy suffers from an inability to pass international resolutions. And it continues to lack alliances, where member civs can collude to rally your friends against an enemy. Each would be an alternative form of joint action to the other. Another diplomatic absence are vassals and colonies, both of which added depth and neither of which is adequately replaced by Puppet Cities. I finally miss the random events of BTS and their impact on world society.--Test of Time--That's how the odd-numbered entries of the series go. It gives, it takes, it experiments with new ideas without being a big leap forward. So is this expansion jump worth the money?As my title indicates, the one missing executive was the businessman. No corporations. But business sense tells the player that what was new to predecessors should have been default in the successor. As in my review forCivilization V Game of the Year, I recommend that players who haven't made the big leap from Civ4 can wait until a bundle with Gods and Kings comes out. Those who do have Civ5 can simply wait for a holiday sale on Steam.I give kudos to the developers for several innovations and evolutions in this pack. It earns my four star approval... not my obsession. There are reasons why I'm not a game junkie anymore. Will Civ6 take the jade away and set my nerves on fire? Gods and kings only know.", "\"I wasn't overly impressed with Civ 5 when it first came out. I was so unimpressed, in fact, that for the last year or so I've ignored it and been playing Civ IV. There were a lot of things I didn't like about 5, like the lack of religion and espionage, the no-unit-stacking policy, the limited number of civs, the strangeness of the naval units and, frankly, I didn't get why everyone went so mad over the idea of the hex grid. I always found it rather annoying.Thankfully while the hex grids and no stacking remain, this expansion adds in more civilizations, more city-states (for them as likes those), more naval units, espionage and religion! And boy, let me tell you about the religion options. They are astounding. First off, you get to adopt a pantheon fairly early in the game, which adds some minor bonuses. But then, once you have a great prophet, you can found an actual religion. There's all the ones from IV, plus ones like Zoroastrianism and Sikhism, as well as Tengriism, which sent me to Wikipedia, since I'd never heard of it before (though my guess on what it might have been was correct. Hooray!).The diplomacy options have also expanded significantly. Now you can establish embassies in other countries, which gives you the location of their capitol and allows for other diplomatic niceties. You can also, if you are playing the Austrians, buy city-states, which is remarkably useful. There's also a large number of scenarios, including a steampunk one that I look forward to playing.Now like I said, not all the \"\"problems\"\" I have with the game are fixed. But that said, I find that I enjoy the game much, much more with these features added and it might, finally, be time for me to retire from Civ IV.\"", "I enjoy playing Civilization V and the Gods and Kings pack brings much more variety to the game. For starters it adds Religion and Espionage back into the game. It adds 9 new civilizations which makes the game more enjoyable to play. It can totally change the game and make it easier or more difficult depending on which civilization you choose to start with. It added a variety of new resources and technology along with 27 new units to fight with. You also get 13 new buildings and 9 new wonders.If you really enjoy playing Civilization V then I am sure that you will enjoy all the additions that are included in this pack.On the downside ever since I updated the software I have these thin lines running diagonally through my screen in some places where people or animals move around. I am not sure if this has anything to do with the Gods and Kings upgrade or if it's just a coincidence. I have tried adjusting the graphics settings but still no change. It doesn't keep me from playing the game but it can be rather annoying sometimes. Maybe eventually I will figure out the cause.", "Admittedly, this is the 1st Civilization game I've played so I can't say how it stacks up against the others but it's certainly not the 1st game of it's type that I've ever played. I got it a while back while looking for XCom. It came in a 3-pack bundle with Civ IV (haven't played that one yet) and XCom (uninstalled this tripe after about a week) for ~$20.Anywho, it's a great game, tons of fun and very easy to pick up and play which is something that can't be said for most games of this type.The graphics are excellent although when moving the camera around the map is SOMETIMES slow to render on my machine with high settings. IDK why because my machine is plenty powerful enough to run this game on high. I guess it's just one of those things. Not really a big deal but I have to look at large chunks of grey areas on the map for a few seconds before things start to show up properly.Some of the annoyances are:*AI opponents can act pretty irrationally. A good for instance would be when you're building your empire, minding your own business with your one small city when long about turn 10 or so Augustus Cesar appears on your screen denouncing you to the world for no apparent reason.*AI picks random religions that they never would have picked in the real world. For example, I have had Gandhi pick Christianity (an atrocious choice for Gandhi) and Catherine the Great pick Buddhism (Catherine the Great was Russian Orthodox). This happens even when they're the first players to get a choice.*Spies seems pretty much totally useless and as easy to detect as a spider in a birthday cake while the enemie's spies are devastatingly effective and seemingly totally immune to detection no matter how many measures you take to combat their presence.*The game chooses the unit it wants you to manage next and the camera automatically goes to that unit, interrupting whatever you were doing or wanted to do after you finished managing the previous unit. Even if you have multiple units in the same spot that have turns left, it will bounce wildy around the map, auto-choosing whatever random unit it wants you to manage. As best I can remember I found where to turn this off in the settings but also as best I can remember, it didn't work very well.*A lot of times after managing several units the A Unit Needs Orders button will still show, making you think there's something left to do before you end the turn but when you click on that button to see what it is it quickly changes to End Turn and ends the turn. This wouldn't be so bad if you weren't wanting to do something else before you ended the turn, say, change a city's settings or just look over and assess some things and sometimes it can be important that you do this before a turn ends.*Occasional crashes but only occasional. Nevertheless, save after every turn because sometimes a crash can really set you back.*For some reason, on my last game I was destined to take the time victory at 2050 but when advancing the game to my winning turn the game would lock up when clicking the End Turn button, making my victory inevitable but unattainable and no amount of going back and restarting from a previous save fixed it. I eventually gave up and started a new game, assuming that Ceasar and Gandhi had their spies rig the software so I couldn't win the game. Ceasar, especially, is a real crybaby!For the record, All of these (other than that last thing) are very minor. They don't detract from the game's immersion or playability to any degree and there's lot of mods that fix most of these issues. They're just there, that's all.Everything else about the game is great and I recommend it to anyone that likes this kind of stuff or even to those that don't if their reason for not liking them is their disproportionate complexity in comparison to other types of games.", "First of all, yes Gods and Kings does significantly improve the baseline civilization game. I really would not recommend spending any time on Civ V unless you also had the expansion pack.Secondly, it doesn't really fix the main problems with the game.The changes in the game amount to more ticking counters, not unlike your culture tree meter. Think of it like a cooldown in an RPG. That's essentially what this is. Multiple cooldowns before you get goodies.The cooldowns take a while, but are interesting. With some careful planning you can find a good synergy between your religion and your play style. Like, some religions are meant as a way for small empires to colonize other civilizations with their missionary units. The religion might give bonuses for every follower outside of your civilization. Or, the civilization might give you bonuses for cities within your civ. Or you might buy units with them. LIke culture bonuses, the more you buy improvements with religion, the more the next upgrade costs.Other changes make unusable civs actually usable. Ships can now capture cities. This is a pretty significant difference from the first, and it makes civs like England with +2 movement for naval vessels much more powerful. Furthermore...it stops the annoying cycle of barbarian tiramies shooting an ai unit over and over in a loop.The espionage system is kind of like the religion system. it's basically another cooldown for when you can steal technologies from other civs. Every civ gets a spy unit with the Renaissance age, and each subsequent age gets another spy.But there isn't much you can do with spies. In Civ 2, spies could sabotage production and bring down walls before invading armies.Here, they can only really steal technology.Sometimes the cooldown on that is like 53 turns.Furthermore, there isn't really any way to boost spy production. Every civ is pretty much equal in spies. The only thing you can do is construct buildings which make enemy spies take longer to steal tech.That's it. I usually end up stationing my first spy in my capital city and wait while he kills enemy spies to level up. Then I send him abroad to steal tech.So here you basically have another set of cool downs to mess with. Still, fundamental problems of the game are not fixed. AI doesn't seem any better. You still have endgame bloat.There also isn't a real sense of urgency ever in the game. In Civ 2 and Civ 3 there often was urgency, like for instance if an enemy civ constructed a launcher to Alpha Centauri and launched it. Then you have like 20 turns or so to take their capital or else you lose the game.That never happens here.Another example is Civ 3's Apoloptic (I spelled it wrong) palace. it basically allowed a diplomatic victory in medieval times. That made for urgent scrambles to where it was and capturing it.That doesn't happen here. Like in Civ 5, this expansion pretty much has you winning effectively like 66% of the way through a normal play through and then you choose how you want to win. There's no real scramble down a specific path because all of the victory paths (with the exception of conquest) lie deep towards the end of the tech tree. The UN is like the last wonder that can be constructed, so there isn't really much time spent going back and forth. It just comes at the end and you usually win within a few turns. The space race option is also near the end, just like the UN.Really this game should be considered basically a gardening simulation. you essentially cultivate a civilization and wait over several hours for it to blossom. There's no real simulation of factions within your civ, or of economic trade flows, or of changing climates resulting in famine, nothing at all. You don't see seasons change or the night. It's always summer.The thing is, there are better games out there and I've played them. A good one is King Arthur the Roleplaying game, which I found to be just as involved economically as civ while giving you a good sense of balancing different factions, and with stunning artwork to boot, and a great storyline. I've played Civ games since Civ 2, but no more. Paradox games are smarter and better balanced.", "\"I loved Civilization from the first game.  I even tried Call to Power, but couldn't do it.Civ 5 clearly simplified too much, I must assume they wanted to increase the pontential number of players, but I don't see how the regular Civ 5 could please anyone.So now the idea is to introduce again Religion and Espionage into the game and (hopefully) some added complexity to the game. It does succeed at that, but at a much smaller level than the previous success of Civilization IV.Religion was made into an interesting innovation; you basically tailor your religion to your strategy by choosing which benefits it confers.  For example you can receive benefits for having the religion spread into different civilizations, or simply by the number of cities (your or others) affected, or the ability to buy building with the new faith points.  Pretty neat, and since a particular benefit can be interesting there is a sort of a race if two civilizations want to pursue the same strategy.The downside is that once the religions are established, there is little gameplay with them.  So they change the game from the beginning to say... 500 AD.  By them mostly everyone will have  a religion picked out.  It was a fine addition, but it mostly changed the early game in a relatively minor way.Espionage is the big let down.  It begins in the Renaissance (it is as if the game knew religion would be mostly played out by then) and you get one spy to try to steal tech or influence city-states.  Far too little gameplay and involvement, the spy doesn't exist on the map and it all happens in the \"\"Espionage screen\"\".  It is a cheap add on that does nothing to the game and is absurdly limited.  You get one new spy per age, so you can't move resources into more spies because basically they have very little to actually do.The greatest success is actually naval combat.  Now you have long range and melee ships, and you can attack cities more effectively with a navy. Naval combat was drastically improved with this.The new civs are irrelevant to me.  I don't care about new luxury items.  The foreign policy is very mildly different for city states, but the original one was practically broken, so I see this more as a patch than an effective expansion of the game.So this expansion is ok, but not worth the price.  It improves mildly Civ5, but it still is incredibly inferior to Civ4 in every way but graphics.\"", "I was missing religion.  I can't say I ADORE the way that it was implemented (almost as if it was another resource) but I did enjoy it's return.  Also, there are a lot of complexities that flesh out Civ V.  I think all the Civ games have kind of had to wait for the expansion that made them a little more playable and Gods and Kings is the expansion for this generation of Civ.Somehow, though, the game runs significantly slower, even though most of the changes aren't something you would imagine would make the game run slower.  There are crashes, too.  Yes, they're fixable, but I'm a little tired of beta testing games for developers these days.  You'd think I could get a product that would work on my flawless machine, but so often I have to search for fixes, fixes, fixes.The civs are a little smarter, but not by much.  I do enjoy the way espionage changes the way you deal with your neighboring civs.  You can steal tech, find out if someone intends to attack you, conspire against other sims with the information you've discovered.  Still, you can not-really-win a war and be offered multiple cities for almost nothing.With G&K; Civ5 is richer, deeper, more enjoyable.  Still flawed, though.", "\"How could you not love anything \"\"Civilization\"\" (originally created by Sid Meier`s) this expansion greatly improves the over all game play of \"\"Sid Meier's Civilization V\"\" in so many ways. Another expansion \"\"Brave New World\"\"; is in the making and from what I saw will take this franchise to the next level. (I can`t wait)  So if you have \"\"Sid Meier's Civilization V\"\" you must get this expansion (you can`t play \"\"Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings\"\"  without it) I really recommend this add on and so will you!\"", "Civ IV is my favorite PC game of all time. I was sorely disappointed when Civ V came out, as it severely limits the gameplay options and removed many of the things that made Civ IV great (religion being one that I sorely missed). I kept reading that Gods & Kings brought back a lot of the things that were missing, and indeed it does. It's a great expansion. I still don't find myself as hopelessly addicted to this as I was to Civ IV, but it's much better than the core game. Highly recommended for anyone who tried Civ V and was disappointed.", "I'm still not a fan of Civ V, but this expansion basically completes the game. If you want to play Civ V without lots of missing features, it's a must-buy."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03315691649913788, 0.003641128307208419, 0.11423847824335098, 0.24167391657829285, 0.060851454734802246, 0.012542009353637695, 0.3681621849536896, 0.06486579775810242, 0.0149875832721591, 0.04057144373655319, 0.04530901834368706]]}
