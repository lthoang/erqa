I find it to be very well constructed, somewhat limited in space, comfortable to wear, and with a lot of pockets, but not very useful as a general purpose backpack.Design:The backpack is all black, with sturdy seams and material. Directly behind the straps is the main area for a laptop, which zips all the way down one side and only across the top due to the location (actually under the main shoulder straps). Continuing back, one finds the largest compartment containing two zippered mesh areas and a padded slot that will accommodate a 10 inch tablet. Moving towards the back of the pack is a smaller compartment with a large open area along with a single zipper compartment  and three pouch locations meant for cell phones (one with pen slots). At the very rear of the backpack is a very shallow area with a side zipper that is meant for boarding passes and other items that are not too thick. The straps have a velcro system that is designed to let you neatly contain any excess strap material when the straps are tightened. Other than a single piece of material on the straps that might be used to clip a cell phone, the exterior has no attachment points (such as would be used to hang something using a carabiner). Dimensions are 13.4 x 5.9 X 19.7 inches exterior and 15.2 x 1.7 x 10.5 inches interior.What I like:Because the pack is really only designed for the one use - laptop / tablet and accessories - it is very compact in depth and won't bulk up your back.The construction is very good, as one would expect from Case Logic. Almost all the seams fold inward; that is to say there are few exposed threads, which bodes well for longevity.Since the laptop is carried right next to the back, with the entire pack on one side and your body on the other, this pack provides good protection for the laptop.Mesh is used both where the backpack touches the back, and under the straps. This is meant to improve airflow and make it less hot to carry. I'm not sure it helps much, but it is a nice touch.All the compartments are near the top of the pack. This is an advantage when one is looking for an item, and it means that anything dropped into the main compartment won't fall out. However, it also means that one cannot unzip the pack wide open for easier packing.The interior tablet compartment is well sized and has some padding. I think it will protect my tablet well.The pack has a nice carrying handle on top for those times when you need to carry it, but don't want to put it on your back.What I don't like:The main compartment is meant for today's thinner laptops. The documentation says it will contain a Macbook Pro or up to 15.6\"\" PC laptops. I put my old Dell 8200 into it and it barely fit. I think it will suffice if you have a laptop that is fairly new, but definitely won't work for a 17\"\" model.This is designed as a single use backpack. That means it is really not suitable for a student, for example, because none of the compartments expand very well. If one is looking for just a laptop pack, this is fine, but it could have been designed for multiple use. For example, there is ample room in the pack for more compartments (if the sides unzipped fully).I like it when manufacturers try new things, but the \"\"strap management system\"\", which is a small piece of velcro that wraps around excess strap, is a bit overkill, simply because I often like to loosen the straps to put the pack on, and then tighten it up. With the pack on my back I'm hardly going to take the time to straighten up the excess straps!Conclusion:If you need a pack that is just for carrying your newer laptop, a tablet, and the accessories, this is the one to get. If you need to carry significantly more than this, another design may work better.\"", "\"This is a useful and utilitarian backpack.  There is a compartment for the laptop at the rear of the bag. It is separate from the rest of the bag and will hold the laptop safely between the main backpack compartment and the user.There is also a compartment for an IPad, Kindle, or similarly sized device.Overall this backpack has four compartments.  The laptop area, the pad area, the larger center area, then a smaller compartment that can be use phones, pens, or other small items.The backpack is sturdy and well made. The material is strong enough that it can withstand quite a bit of weight without worries of loose stitching.  In actuality, if used for a laptop, the backpack probably won't be weighted down with other items. However, there is room and capability to do so within reason.My 15\"\" laptop fit perfectly in the pocket, very safe and snug.  My son has a larger laptop and we tried using the backpack with his as well. Of course, it was too bit to fit in the laptop compartment AND have it zipped. But it did fit snugly in the compartment and, in a pinch, it could be carried there.  He was able to fit it into the main compartment of the backpack and there was plenty of room for it.  He then placed his cords and accessories in the compartment that was made for the laptop without compromising the safety of his machine.  This backpack has so much padding and is so sturdy that it would actually work for a slightly larger laptop.  The effect wouldn't be as streamline but it is safer than carrying it in a traditional backpack or without any protection at all.The fit is comfortable and, for being so padded, there isn't a noticeable weighted feeling when using the backpack.I am so impressed with this backpack that I will be buying my son one for himself.  Even at the list price, this is an excellent investment.  I am so impressed with the quality of the material and the stitching that my frugal self would pay full price without blinking an eye.This would be an excellent graduation gift for a high school student going off to college or for anyone of any age who needs to commute anywhere with a laptop.\"", "This is the second of these cases I've purchased.... this one for my boss who travels constantly.I love the way my Dell XPS 15z fits snugly into the pouch at the back of the case where it's best protected.  I carry my notebook with my daily, so this is used every day.  The pockets in this backpack are very well designed and can hold a LOT of materials.  I particularly love the fact that the central pocket is &#34;wider&#34; at the bottom and holds the charger for the notebook so that it doesn't impact other storage.  The number and location of pockets has been carefully planned to optimize the space while ensuring that the loaded backpack is comfortable to carry and doesn't become distended.  The material on the portion that fits next to your body is soft and breathable, which makes it comfortable to carry.My only complaint about the design would be the Velcro straps that are used to lengthen/shorten the carrying straps.  They work very well, but some of the rough Velcro is exposed; so several of my shirts now have pulls in them as a result.  However, this is not a big enough issue for me to keep from recommending the case highly... I've not found a better designed case at any price.", "\"This backpack is amazing--the multitude of pockets and types of pockets, the protective padding, and the comfortable design make this a great way to carry valuable electronics, among other things.There were two issues that almost made me give this 4 stars:1. I have the large Macbook Pro and it doesn't fit in the back panel that most protects a laptop. It WILL fit in the main body of the backpack, but because the padding on the bottom of that is somewhat thin (compared to that in the slot Meant for laptops), if you were to set the backpack down abruptly, it might jostle the device a little, plus if you're carrying other things in the main body, they would all bump against the laptop. Probably not a big deal, but these things are so expensive, so one gets protective.2. There is a Velcro thing on one of the adjustable straps that hang down (the straps that adjust for the portion that goes over the shoulder). The Velcro on one side exposes the \"\"hook\"\" part, and because there is no way to cover it, it can snag clothing. I'm not sure how the manufacturer allowed this to happen or if mine is just defective, but it's a huge problem if you have nice clothing. It can permanently ruin clothes. That is a pretty big problem for me. I'll probably end up having to cut it off or something, but that will cause the straps to unravel and get too long.Otherwise, this is an excellent product with plenty of space and tons of great storage.\"", "So much space on a non-bulky backpack, it's like magic. It's like a wormhole beware. XD", "This laptop backpack has quite a lot going for it, especially when it comes to the pockets and the streamline design of it.  It's exceptionally slim for a backpack, much more so than its competitors, which is both a good and bad thing.  Let me say it does look perfectly sophisticated, and I can see using this in a business situation where I only needed my laptop, Ipad, notebook, and writing tools.  However, I wouldn't recommend this for college.  I don't know about most people, but I walked a lot on campus, and ultimately had to carry at least two pretty thick books, and this backpack is not up to that particular task.  I could see carrying one slim textbook, but that's about it.  This is basically a straight up laptop backpack.That being said...it's pretty darn nice.  Completely black, slim design, no bulky compartments anywhere, and the zippers are even black and long/slim, which makes for a very stylish, but simple, backpack.  It has four zippered openings.  The first, and smallest is the very outer compartment that has a zipper sideways.  This is perfect for keys, cell phone, gum wrappers, etc.  The next compartment can house a smaller notebook, or book, and it has a zippered pouch at the top, plus three pockets, one with two pen holders.  These are perfect for your MP3 player, calculator, cell phone, etc.  The next to largest compartment has enough room to stick a regular sized notepad, book, etc. in it.  It also comes with two mesh zippered compartments, one at the top of each side of the opening, and it has one large pocket that easily fits an Ipad with cover.  Very nice touch.  The last zippered area is where the laptop goes.  Now this is the area that actually gave me pause.  The zipper happens to be under the straps.  This really makes it difficult for me to get my laptop in and out in a jiffy.  Add into the picture that the zipper does not open all the way, but only partially down one side, and it just made it a little more complicated.  I, personally, would have preferred the laptop zipper to not be underneath the straps, but it does give the backpack a better appearance as you don't honestly see the zipper from the front.  So it gives the illusion that there are only two zippered compartments. (I say two as you don't really see the zipper for the smallest area in the very front of it).There is also a mesh back to this, which helps vent air plus it adds a nice cushion for your laptop.  As a side note the underside of the straps are also mesh.  But I do have to say when I first put it on and toted it around; it was very tight on my shoulders.  And I'm a very small person.  I had to adjust the straps, but even then it still felt tighter than I would like.  There isn't a ton of cushion, but it does provide the necessary support to where I feel safe carrying it around.  I do recommend this for business use, and some campus life, but if you have to carry around a lot of supplies, then I wouldn't suggest it.", "This is a nice, sturdy backback. Perfect for students, business, and travel. I'd give it a 5, but there are a few things that I didn't like about it, so here's the breakdown:What I liked: It has a padded back and padded straps. The design of the straps fits comfortably. They curve just right for a good fit on the shoulders. Lots of pockets and zipper spaces. I liked the slide-in zuppered pocket on the front for travel because it's easy to get to a passport and ID in the airport. It's lightweight, so only the stuff you put in it adds to the bulk. I love the rubber grips on the zipper pulls, and the padded top handle too. Also, there is padding in the bottom where the laptop is supposed to rest (extra protection).What I didn't like: My 15.5 inch screen laptop just fit in the compartment designed for the laptop. However, this compartment is on the very back, under the straps, meaning that once I put the pack on, the stiffness of my huge laptop made it impossible to actually wear it comfortably. The thing stuck out at a weird angle, and despite the padding, it was just too stiff on my back. It would also put a lot of strain on the laptop and set up a possible situation where the screen could crack if I bent over with it on. However, once I put the laptop in the middle compartment (where other stuff is intended to go) it worked much better for me and felt more comfortable to wear. Also, I wished it had a water bottle pocket on it. I don't like to put a bottle inside where it can get stuff wet.I'll just use the laptop compartment for papers and files and put the laptop in the middle compartment. It fits well there and there's still room in the pockets for the cords and stuff. If you have a smaller laptop, iPad, or a netbook, you'll have no trouble with it.", "Great bag fits one laptop just fine in the back and a 10inch tablet in the pocket before it with great padding for it.Something to know though is, you may want to think about it because fitting it in with a case or a thicker type skin may have your laptop fit a little too tightly.Despite this though, this bag has a great variety of places of where to place extra things like a charger for you laptop, external hard drive, or USB(s).Be aware though because the size of the bag fits a 15 inch laptop just right means your bag could be bulging a little bit IF you a tech guru like myself and carry quite a number of tools with you, USB's, hard drive/ SSD, cords no dbout etc. You may want to choose another bag for your laptop but, has more space for it.", "\"I like:- general design is clean. Good fit for non fancy business use or just for school.- the internal mash pockets are pretty comfortable - easy access for your stuff- internal iPad/tablet padded pocket can fit a MacBook air 13\"\" snugly.- external laptop compartment is interesting and easy to use- the bag can easily fit 2 laptops- the zipper handles can support a lock- the bag is comfortable- the edges of the straps are folded in a way that don't let them dangle, looks less messy- good size: not too big and bulky and not too small and slim.I don't like:- the bag somehow looks a bit simple or cheap, hard to explain why.- there are no fast access pockets/compartments for stuff like: keys, phone, money, credit card. The external pocket seems to be a better fit for left handed: when I want to reach the pocket, I usually bring it to the front through my right shoulder (since I'm right handed), however the zipper for that external pocket is on the other side - making it hard to get thins out.So if you are a business traveler - I wouldn't recommend this bag, but if you are looking for a day to day bag for work, or for school - it's a nice looking, nicely sized, bi-sexual backpack.\"", "\"So, you have a huge laptop and an iPad or TouchPad?  Slam them both in this bag; there's spots just right for each.  Inside the largest compartment is a lined pouch designed to nestle your tablet without harming the screen.  A side-zipped small pouch is designed to allow quick access to plane tickets and passports, without hunting for the zipper pull.  All the zipper pulls are very rugged and durable.  My only nit-pick on this bag is there isn't a dedicated little pouch for a thumb-drive; there are three for pens, and by golly, I got my secure card USB to fit in the pen slot, but it was tight fit.  Another Case Logic product, Case Logic VNA-216, has a dedicated pouch, so I was surprised this didn't have one.  One nice feature is velcro straps to bind up the excess strap length on the shoulder straps, so you don't have loose ends to trip on.  Believe me, I've tripped on them before!Overall, a great bag.  I was able to fit an HP EliteBook 8560w 15.6\"\" laptop in there, but it is a snug fit.\"", "This is a very nice-looking, slim and comfortable backpack. I like the sleek black streamlined design, that can pass for almost any use from casual to semi-professional. It works great for carrying myMacBook Pro, along with a few books and papers.There's a padded laptop sleeve that keeps the laptop snug directly against the back. Then comes a larger compartment, that has room for things like books and various equipment, with two internal mesh pockets and a padded sleeve that fits an iPad nicely. Then there's a thinner compartment, with room for papers or a folder or a thin book, with pockets for things like pens and pencils, calculators, phones or mp3 players. Finally, there another outer pocket where you could keep a notebook or a dayplanner or the like.This is not a bulky and roomy backpack designed to function as a mobile locker, with room for everything and then some. Rather, it's designed for the student or casual professional who likes to travel light with only a laptop and a few other essential items.  It'd be ideal for the bicycle commuter, and it works great for someone like me, a teacher who needs to bring a computer back and forth from home to work, and almost always carries home and back just a book or two and a stack or two of papers to grade. It's well built, and nicely padded, without looking rugged. I like it quite a bit.", "\"In this age of technology, a laptop or tablet is almost necessary for many aspects our active lives.  Case Logic has outdone itself by introducing this sporty solution to carrying it with us, plus many of the other things we might need to have at our fingertips.This black, low-profile pack has four external zippered pouches to accommodate your many needs!  Starting with the basics, it sports:* A nice sized, well-padded zippered pouch for a 15.6\"\" for maximum protection and comfort.* A nice large zippered pouch to put notebooks and tablets (both electronic and the old fashioned kind).  This pouch also has a padded internal pouch for an e-reader or for the aforementioned e-tablet, and two more zippered mesh pouches for other odds and ends.  So many that hubby smuggled deep-fried mozzarella sticks from the school mess hall in mine - without my knowledge!* Another thinner zippered pouch that is ideal for notepads, legal pads, and other documents, another private zippered pouch inside that and other divided pouches for pens, pencils, cell phones, etcetera.* Finally, on the front of the backpack there is one more zippered pouch which is useful to put letters to be mailed, small note pads, or whatever might be wanted for quick access.The only thing that I would like to see added to this pack is a place to store the battery charger and cords in with the laptop.  There are other places that the charger could be stowed, but it would be more convenient to put the hardware all in one pouch.This is a nice pack that's big enough to take on the campus, and sleek enough to carry to the office, and the adjustable padded shoulder straps make it comfortable to carry, even over just one shoulder!\"", "\"This attractive-looking backpack is roomy, has comfortable adjustable shoulder straps and contains four compartments.  The compartment that sits closest to a backpacker's back is \"\"topped off\"\" by the shoulder straps (i.e., portions of the wide shoulder straps cover up part of the compartment's zippered top) and has room enough for a laptop with up to a 15.6 inch display (like my Asus laptop).  This compartment has very good padding, including the bottom, and has two zippers with big handles; one of the zippers opens all the way down to just four inches above the bottom, the other doesn't extend further than the shoulder -- a feature that I think gives the stored laptop a little bit of added protection by controlling the amount of space available for maneuvering the said laptop into and out of the backpack.To the front of this compartment is the roomier \"\"main\"\" compartment, which can also be used to store the above-mentioned laptop, but be aware that the bottom is not as well-padded as the previous compartment's bottom.  One \"\"wall\"\" of the main compartment comes with a good-sized zippered mesh pocket; the other \"\"wall\"\" contains two pockets: a small, zippered mesh pocket located at the top, and in the bottom is a padded pocket for storing an iPad or a similarly-sized tablet.  The main compartment has two zippers with big handles.Of the remaining two compartments, both of which are smaller than the previous two compartments, the bigger one has two zippers with big handles, a zippered pocket, and three smaller non-zippered pockets for pens and small devices, such as an iPod or a cell phone.The frontmost as well as the smallest compartment opens on the side, and its single zipper is tucked away from view.  Its dimensions are, roughly, 7.25 inches wide and 10 inches tall (so room enough for, say, a slim and medium-ish sized writing pad).The backpack has a nice styling and is well-constructed.  Overall, a very nice backpack.\"", "i really like Case Logic bags as of late. They're nicer than they once were and they sport a lot more storage space. This is good because a lot of backpack type computer totes no longer come with the space needed to pull off schooling and the myriad of books required along with that computer.First, this bag has a lot of pockets. The computer one is actually almost against the back, but it does not ride rough along the back - which is nice. It is also a thick one , really padded, and most of the bag is also padded. This means you can expect a bit more protection than some of the bags that only offer one layer of protection.The bag has four main areas, all told, with a smaller pocket in the front, an area with slots for different types of items - including my extra Ipod or E reader, a main area for books, and a place for the computer. In the third area it also has some mesh zippers to put stuff, and i like them more for cords because they're a lot larger than any needs for pencils/pens.a lot fits in this and it is one of my choices for moving around. I use a heavy case for protecting my stuff if i know I am going to be jostling anything around, but any time you need extra protection like in a school setting, this would be prefect. Case Logic has come a long ways - i like this a lot.", "Lots of pockets and seems to be built pretty well. It's super light! I have a 13&#34; MacBook Air, Apple USB SuperDrive, charging cords, display port, etc., a legal sized pad of paper, pens, and a bunch of other stuff in this thing and it's still so light I barely know it's on my back."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.27960115671157837, 0.02891477197408676, 0.0007487436523661017, 0.0016231524059548974, 0.22903716564178467, 0.00894537940621376, 0.021988170221447945, 0.022727809846401215, 0.0006695353658869863, 0.037206098437309265, 0.01092470996081829, 0.07611727714538574, 0.0009058649302460253, 0.004892606288194656, 0.2756975293159485]]}
