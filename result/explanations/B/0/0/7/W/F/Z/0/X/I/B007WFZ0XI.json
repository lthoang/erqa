"], "reviews": ["I hate winter for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that my hands get so dry that I get cracks at my fingertips. It&#8217;s annoying and painful, especially at night. I&#8217;ve tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that&#8217;s messy and it still doesn&#8217;t work well.This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I&#8217;ve tried.The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a &#8220;spritz&#8221; head. The latter is my only quibble &#8211; the spray head didn&#8217;t work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results &#8211; I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that&#8217;s more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it&#8217;s oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in &#8211; my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.I&#8217;m very impressed with this oil &#8211; it&#8217;s the only product I&#8217;ve ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It&#8217;s not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]", "Savanaahs Argan Oil is a quality product. The packaging is high quality, making it worthy of giving as a gift. There is an option to have a pump or dropper for dispensing. I choose to use the pump, but I think the dropper could be helpful to make sure you don't use too much. Don't expect a great smell from the oil. The smell was not my favorite, but it didn't last long. There are many benefits to using Argan oil for your skin, but my wife's preferred use was for her hair. She has wavy/curly hair and if she doesn't blow it dry it can look frizzy. With the Argan oil the frizzies are gone. The oil makes her curls look great. But, a word of caution, after using the Argan oil it doesn't look as good when she straightens her hair with a flat iron. Be very careful with the amount you use on your hair. A little goes a long way. My daughter has straight, thin hair and used some to try to help with split ends. One full pump was too much and left her hair looking greasy. Using the dropper and getting just one drop would have been better. To top it all off, it is nice to use a product that is Fair Trade and supports Women's Co-Operatives.", "I have to admit that I'd never heard of using argan oil for anything so when I was invited to test a sample I was intrigued and started looking up the many uses and purported benefits.This is some of what I found:&#34;In cosmetics, argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil, against juvenile acne and flaking of the skin as well as for nourishing the hair. This oil has also medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns ... Externally, argan oil is used ... for hair as brilliantine, to fortify and ... in the treatment of wrinkled or scaly dry skin.&#34; So while I can't say that these claims are correct, it's worth a try if you suffer at all from anything as little as dry skin to brittle hair.I've been using it on my daughter who has eczema on hands. Although we use it in conjunction with a prescribed lotion, I always layer it with the argan oil. The argon oil goes on as a really thin oil but quickly rubs in and with just a little bit of massage, penetrates deep into the skin to help regain lost moisture. And it seems to have helped. I like using in on my hands and elbows and occasionally in my hair.It doesn't have a strong smell, a little musky but not sweet. I like the eyedropper but it also comes with a spray attachment.", "I have nothing negative to say about this product.  The packaging is absolutely beautiful so if you're looking for a gift, this is a perfect option.  They provide you with both a sprayer and a dropper so that you can decide which to use.  I really appreciated that fact because all the other argan oils I have, only have a sprayer and I don't like to spray it.The oil itself has exactly the quality of all the other ones I had tried.  ALL argan oil has a slight scent, including this one.  I read reviews of this one where people were complaining about a scent.  I have 3 different bottles of argan oil from 3 different manufacturers sitting on my counter so I did a smell test.  They ALL smelled identical.  So I think the people complaining about the scent, just don't like the scent of argan oil.  You have to keep in mind that this is not a chemically processed product that has added scent to it.  It smells like the kennels of the argan tree, as it should.The oil is rich and nurturing.  I use it on my hair (only about 5-10 drops and I have a ton of hair, if you use too much, it'll weigh it down), as lotion for myself and my little 5 year old.  We have put aside all chemically laden lotions and only use argan oil. I even use it on my face over my wrinkles (but you have to make sure your skin is super clean before doing that) and I normally don't like to put anything on my skin because I break out easily.  This product has caused no breakouts for me.As you can tell from the review, I really like this product and I am a hard person to please.I received a sample for review.", "Argan Oil has many benefits . It is rich in natural antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and high levels of Vitamin E. It does not clog pores. It does reduce fine lines, treat stretch marks and helps to keep skin healthy and glowing. It is also good to mend our hair's split ends, and it moisturizers hair to keep it soft and healthy.Savanaah's Organic Argan Oil came beautifully packaged. A lovely box, and nestled inside was the 4 oz bottle of Argan oil with two dispensers. One for drops and one with a push down pump. The bottle is encased in it's own box, surrounded with fine shredded fine paper. This would make a lovely gift.I use the Argan oil at night. I use one or two drops on my face and massage it gently into my skin and lightly under my eyes. I also use it on my feet, the soles of and ankles. It keeps my skin smooth and moist, relieving the dry skin of winter. I also use it on my hands and massage some of the oil into my cuticles, keeping them moist. This is a wonderfully light oil with a mild nutty odor that completely disappears within a few minutes. This organic Argan oil is the best I have used.Recommended. prisrob 03-18-14", "\"Even though the bottle says \"\"fragrance-free\"\" I find the scent is natural and a little organic/nutty-smelling, but out of 4 argan oils I have used, this is the least offensive other than Josie Maran's. If you've ever tried Josie's, hers has virtually no odor but it's almost $100 for a 4 ounce bottle, a price I'm not willing to pay any longer. This brand by Savanaah's will be my new go-to argan oil. It takes only 2 small drops for my face, any more than that and it feels greasy. After it soaks in, my face feels and looks amazing; I have a glow like someone in her early 20's and I'm in my late 40's, with dry, sensitive skin. You can tell that Divine Organics/Savanaah's really cares in the way they package this--very suitable for gift-giving and that they care about the Earth (ethically sourced through Fair Trade & Organic Sustainable Farming & they support an Eco-Friendly Environment).This comes packaged with a dropper like you normally find with argan oil, but also a pump...I tossed the pump as it dispenses way too much oil at once.~~~~sample received for review~~~~\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.17523327469825745, 0.15816430747509003, 0.17231635749340057, 0.18154269456863403, 0.15019017457962036, 0.16255317628383636]]}
