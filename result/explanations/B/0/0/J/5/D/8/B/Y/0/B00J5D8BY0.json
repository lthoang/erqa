I was really surprised to see what a nice big pump this came in! I didn't realize before that it said that it was 2oz., because most of them are .5 or 1 ounce. It is a nice big bottle-the picture with the woman holding on her hand, that is really how big it is! I really like the subtle, refreshing scent, and all of the great things that is doing for my skin. I am pretty particular about the products I use, especially on my face. This was super attractive to me because not only is it FDA approved, but NOT tested on animals AND 100% PURE! Additionally, it was made in the US! For me, it was a no brainer, I had to try it. I am so glad that I have. This is giving my skin all the extra hydration it needs...especially living here in Florida, and during the summer!Excellent seller! Great communication and SUPER FAST shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime! Thanks for this magnificent product!! :)", "Can't get enough of this stuff. Feels amazing and light on my face and doesn't break my skin out! I will definitely be coming back for more of this stuff! Thank you for making a superior product!", "I like this serum. I use hyaluronic serum daily and have been receiving compliments. It makes a remarkable difference when added regularly to a skin care routine.  I apply it first then add my daily moisturizer over and then my makeup...all of which apply well over the hyaluronic acid serum. This serum helps my skin from drying out.  When it dries out during the day it causes the lines to be more pronounced. Beauty Be comes in a no spill pump bottle which also prolongs the life of the product, plus there is more in the bottle.  Its mad i the USA in an FDA approved facility.  It is a good product, a good value. good customer service.", "I have tried so many moisturizers out on the market and had not found something that really worked for me....until now.  This stuff is amazing!  I have noticed a huge difference from day one.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin looks and feels amazing.  I highly recommend.", "This Moisturizer is working great for me! I live in a very dry climate and it is hard to find a good moisturizer that is not oily. This product goes on smoothly, absorbers quickly and makes my skin feel fantastic. I have seen a reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles. I highly recommend this product!", "Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased. Girlfriend loves this moisturizer.", "This is a really great moisturizer.  It comes in a nice size pump bottle and looks very attractive.  The moisturizer goes on very light for easy coverage of the skin.  I am very happy with the results of this moisturizer.  I saw a major difference in my skin with the first application.  I noticed fine lines and the puffiness under my eyes have lessened.  It is also made in the USA, which is a bonus.  I highly recommend this product.", "Nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer. Gel consistency. Dispenses in a pump. Light weight. Applies easy and leaves face soft and smooth."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12069825083017349, 0.1255384236574173, 0.12361560016870499, 0.12723006308078766, 0.1261725276708603, 0.127171128988266, 0.1340637505054474, 0.11551027745008469]]}
