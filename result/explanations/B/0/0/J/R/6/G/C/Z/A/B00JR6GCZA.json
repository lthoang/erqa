Using this LG monitor in split screen mode easily replaces the need for two traditional smaller monitors.  In a word, it's exceptional.  Screen resolution is excellent for HD video as well as online gaming.  In addition, it has essentially done away with my need for a separate television as it features multiple HDMI ports so I can also hook up my DVD/Blu-Ray player.For a screen this size, the monitor is surprising light weight and easy to assemble.  Out of the box it took me about five minutes to attach the stand, plug it in to my PC, and start using the device.  The only assembly required is using a couple screws (provided) to connect the stand to the body of the monitor and snapping a plastic cover over the screw holes.One important issue to note is that this monitor does not include a VGA input port.  This will likely not be an issue for most people as newer computers using include an HDMI port, and a VGA port would likely be inadequate for such a large HD monitor.  Also, given the shape of the screen, expect two large black bars on the side when watching either wide screen or full screen programs.  This device is designed to be a computer monitor and not a standalone TV, so the shape is not such that it is filled by widescreen video.This is an excellent quality, easy-to-use product that is well worth the price as it can potentially take the place of two existing devices.  I had not used an LG monitor or television for several years based on some past issues.  However, this device has made me reassess that decision.  It is easily recommended.", "As I write this review I know that this item is not available yet for purchase on Amazon, and probably will get unhelpful votes, as I did receive this from Amazon vine and probably wouldn't have purchase this on my own without that. But with that being said here is my review:I am not really tech savvy, but we do have a need for monitors in my house. First off it was very easy to put together. Screws are provided to screw the base to the screen. There are two height selections to choose from, they are about an inch apart. The base is silver with a clear body that attaches to the screen. Very seamless, and lightweight.I decided to use this monitor in a less conventional way, and hook it up to the xbox 360 to play games, watch youtube videos, and amazon prime. The hook up is real easy. Haven't tried it yet, but would like to see with the split screen capabilities whether or not you can connect two xbox consoles and play them simultaneously.The screen is very wide, being 34inches, so it really changes the way you play xbox games.  Feels like you are actually seeing more of the game. But if it is too much for you, you can scale down the size of the screen. For the xbox menus it does stretch, but for the actual gaming it does not.  And the monitor being so crisp it great to watch movies from Amazon prime and youtube. I have never seen a display so crisp and clear like this monitor.", "This monitor is so big that I find it more uncomfortable work with than my slightly smaller monitor. The colors are great, and I had intended to use this split screen for work, but at split screen I don't like the final screen size either.I think this is a lot of money for this monitor as well. I have two other monitors that cost less than half of what this cost, and they work just as well with a more manageable screen size.I do tons of photo editing, video production, and web site development and actually prefer two separate monitors to using this as a split screen.Gamers on the other hand will fall in love with this monitor and find it very useful to get so much on their screen.Before you buy, I recommend you try to see if this will be a good choice for you.", "I am very impressed with this monitor.  I put it onto my computer with ease.  Then I decided I would use it as a TV in our bedroom to replace a very old one that we had.  It works great for that as well.  Very big screen, clear picture.  Very nice.", "I will get down to the nitty gritty in just a second, but I have to open this review by saying that this monitor is so stunning, so incredibly crisp, clear and vivid that I feel like I need better eyes just to take it all in. When I switch from this monitor to my Apple monitor I feel like I am switching from real life to a coloring book.With that out of the way, the UM95 LG monitor is a 60hz 3440x1440 monitor with a semi-matte display, two HDMI ports, Display port, 3 USB and 2 thunderbolt inputs so right away you can tell that this is a serious piece of electronics. Once you get it up and running, you find that that's only the tip of the iceberg.Besides the stunning display (I mean stunning - blacks are true black, colors pop off the screen and even teeeeenny tiny font and images look crisp and perfect) the wide format means that you really have some ample real estate for all of your programs. And even better, the monitor can handle two separate inputs, which means that you can run one computer through one input and a Blu-Ray player movie through another (for instance). It took a little bit of fiddling around, but I got the two input feature to work with minimal fuss.The monitor also includes software that allows you to split your screens automatically. That means that if you have a browser, Photoshop, a mail client and a second browser running, with just a click of a button the software will automatically divide your programs up into four equal parts of the screen (or thirds or halves or a range of combinations, including manual) so that you can see everything you need to see. I'm already finding the extra space so useful that I struggle when I have to go back to using a plain old single-width monitor.I was worried that the double width would make the screen difficult to view at the edges, but I think it is just the right width that you can take everything without moving your head and without having the screen split into two so that you can angle it better. As far as speed goes, the monitor is quick through Thunderbolt, no lag that I can see at all.The monitor claims to cover 99% of the SRGB spectrum and I have to say, I don't doubt it. When photo editing, I can see colors that I never knew were in the image and everything looks so full and lifelike that I doubt I can ever edit on a standard monitor again. I will just feel like I am missing details.The LED backlighting makes the screen look even and very vivid. When I plugged my Macbook Pro into the monitor, the desktop that I have been using for years suddenly looked more detailed and lifelike than it has ever looked before. Amazing. The pre-calibrated settings work great but a little toggle button on the bottom of the monitor gives you quick access to change whatever you need and get things just how you like them. My Macbook Pro had no trouble running this monitor - I tried both HDMI and Thunderbolt connects - and the resolution works with no problem (my laptop is 2011 model). My husband's PC couldn't handle the resolution so it just ended up having black bars on the two sides, so kind of a waste if your laptop can't manage to resolution, so check to make sure that it can.I have one minor complaint, but it isn't a big deal. When you use the built-in speakers to listen to music - which are incredibly good for built-ins, by the way - you can't use the volume keys on the Mac keyboard, nor can you use the dimming keys to make the monitor brighter in dark rooms. * EDIT - this is only the case when using HDMI input. If I use the Thunderbolt input, the volume (but not dimming) works from the keyboard input. You also must have the Thunderbolt cable if you want to use the USB ports for a laptop mouse and keyboard. Without the Thunderbolt, the USB ports don't work (took me a while to figure this out).Did I mention the display is amazing?", "This is, by far, the nicest monitor I've ever owned. It also happens to be incredibly user-friendly, too, which I appreciate. The ultra-wide screen (21:9 aspect ratio) can easily be split into four different viewing sections at the touch of a button. I love being able to view multiple documents, applications, etc., at the same time. The dual link-up feature is very convenient as well, allowing me to hook up my computer and iPhone to the monitor at the same time.Plus, the resolution on this monitor is nothing short of amazing. Like other reviewers have said, editing photos on this screen is such a different experience from editing photos on my laptop; the colors are more vibrant, and I can see so much more detail. I feel like I'm slumming it when I go back to just using my macbook (and I love my macbook).I can really see the impressiveness of the display quality, though, when my husband uses it for playing video games. I thought we had a nice TV before, but there is no contest with the color quality and level of detail in the LG screen. Hubs was absolutely blown away by the video quality, and I have a feeling this monitor is going to &#34;mysteriously&#34; find its way to a permanent spot in his game room very soon.Overall, the LG monitor is stunning and very user-friendly. Highly recommended!", "After my 28&#34; TN Panel monitor died last year, I have been searching for a replacement. Anything above a 24&#34; monitor that is designed specifically for computers is fairly rare, and fairly expensive. There are a few 27 and 28&#34; monitors, but pretty much anything else is going to be a TV monitor with a tuner that is designed for a home entertainment system. Although the price tag on the LG UM95 is very high, it is fairly reasonable when considering the screen size and panel type. Anyone who is considering a monitor of this price tag I expect will already know the difference between a TN and an IPS panel, the types of input connections they need, and what they will be using this for. You can certainly find much cheaper 32&#34; monitors than this, but you won't find a more beautiful IPS panel that you'll enjoy looking at even when it's off. At 17 pounds, this monitor is extremely light. Since I have mine mounted on anErgotron Wall Mount, it moves very easily and was simple to mount. My 4 year old GPU couldn't run the monitor at its highest settings, so I upgraded to aSapphire Radeon R9 290. I connected it via DisplayPort and had no issues at all with it. I first started up Arma III and jacked the settings up to ultra, including changing the aspect scale to 21:9 and the resolution to 3440 x 1440. I was expecting the screen to go black under the load and have to wait for the auto-revert to kick in, but I was blown away when the changes took affect and I was staring at a beautifully-rendered 3D landscape with a strong FPS counter in the corner. The other thing I noticed when I changed the resolution was how much more of the game was visible. I had roughly a 30% increase in actual viewable display, giving me a much bigger competitive advantage ovr other players. Of course, much of this is attributable to the power of the GPU I'm using, but even before I installed it I was able to get the full resolution through my 4 year old card (just not as responsive).I've been using the monitor for a month now and only have one complaint. The first is that the on button and on screen display controls are not as intuitive as I would like. Since the joystick is on the very bottom of the bezel, it is a little tricky to figure out. Even a month later I still sometimes have trouble trying to turn it off because I move the joystick the wrong way. Also sometimes the joystick on button is not as responsive and doesn't register a push because I haven't pressed hard enough. I feel this could have been designed a little better. Over the next six months, I expect this monitor to drop in price a bit, but if you have the money for it now and do a lot of gaming or photo work and sit close to your screen, this will be one of the most jaw-dropping upgrades you can make to your home system. It is definitely worth the price.", "The color reproduction on this monitor is *GORGEOUS*. My iMac which I was happy with up until now, looks like *garbage* compared to this monitor, hands down. I use this monitor for working on long gantt charts, timelines, and having lots and lots of documents open at once :)You are not going to be able to drive this monitor from any Mac with an Intel graphics chip as of June 2014, (mac mini, macbook air, etc). Devices that have AMD/Nvidia cards seem to be able to drive it at full resolution (at least over display port).Be careful when you unpack this guy, you're not supposed to put any pressure on the screen, grip it from the sides.", "I bought a 4K video card and connecred the monitor with a new 1.2 display port cable.I currently own several very expensive EIZO monitors in the $2k plus range. I mention that in that I know what a very fine monitor should look like.Right away I like the semi-matte finish rather than the very pretty high gloss finishes. The matte cost a little more but is very easy on one's eyes.This monitor is very sharp with stunning and accurate color. The characters are very well formed in their smallest size.The size is interesting and it will take a little time to make full use of it.Great value for the money!!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.009848848916590214, 0.0011798972263932228, 0.49779626727104187, 0.4293796718120575, 0.007408828474581242, 0.012927399016916752, 0.00949097704142332, 0.029552076011896133, 0.0024160444736480713]]}
