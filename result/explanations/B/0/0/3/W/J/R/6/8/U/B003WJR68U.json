Tons of features, unbelievable zoom range. I am also a die-hard Lumix P&S; user and Nikon pro gear shooter. I own the Lumix FX01, TZ3, ZS7, two TS2's and a TS3. The FZ100 is the only of my Lumixes that I have turned around and sold, and I sold it a week after I bought it.The Leica lenses embarrass all but the very highest-end Canon and Nikon P&S; cameras and bury lesser brands like Olympus and Pentax. I have owned a Canon G12 but sold it quickly because its handling was just too sluggish despite having very nice image quality. For DSLR money, I expect reasonable usability speed and the G12 was just frustratingly slow and the menu system was really inefficient. The FZ100 menu is familiar to most P&S; cameras and is a SUPER-easy transition for existing Lumix users.The zoom lens is, frankly, amazing! That range is just spectacular!Handling is quick. Much faster than the Canon G12.So why my really low rating??? Very simple: the sensor is AWFUL! Panasonic opted for this particular sensor because they aimed it at the video market. Well, it takes terrible photos. I'm sorry to say, but it's true. EVERY other Lumix I've owned takes better photos. Megapixels mean NOTHING when the sensor sucks. Colors lacked saturation and depth and images never seemed sharp. Some of this could possibly be because of the lens, but I find it hard to fault a Leica lens when these characteristics are typical of bad sensors, particularly tiny high-megapixel ones and this sensor was not designed for still images.That brings me to the reason I bought this camera; the high-speed video for super-slow-motion. Well, it's ridiculous. If you're not shooting in bright sunlight, and I mean this literally, BRIGHT sunlight, it won't work. To get the really high shutter speed you need for super-slo-mo, you need LOTS of light and/or really high ISO. And speaking of high ISO, the FZ100 has THE worst high ISO performance I've experienced in ANY camera. This is no exaggeration. Anything above ISO 400 is very unappealing and forget ISO 1600, it's downright ugly and wouldn't serve any purpose other than surveillance but ISO 1600 isn't enough for surveillance... Plus, the resolution for super-slow-mo is ridiculously low. Anything beyond crappy YouTube caliber is beyond reach. Even regular HD video is unimpressive. Poor color, saturation and clarity.This camera is chock full of features but it's all for nothing as no matter what you do, you will never get tight colorful saturated images or appealing video and you'll never get that super-slo-mo that made me buy this camera.Though I haven't used it, I'm willing to bet that the FZ40 is a MUCH better choice. It is essentially the SAME camera as the FZ100 but with different sensors and the FZ40 can't do super-slo-mo. But the FZ100, in real life, can't do it either anyway. And the FZ40 doesn't have a swivel screen. Also look into the newer FZ47 and FZ150 offerings. If you can live with a \"\"sane,\"\" and still impressive, zoom range, look into the Lumix ZS7. Very nice images for a P&S;, quite reasonably priced and MUCH smaller.The FZ100 is a huge disappointment from such a great camera company. My only disappointment from Lumix ever. :(\"", "The FZ100 has a CMOS sensor instead of a CCD sensor and is Panasonics 1st superzoom model out with it, in time they might perfect it. It takes nice Videos along with slow motion Video and has a great burst mode.  Most of us buy more Expensive Cameras for image Quality and not for extra features you may use 20% of the time unless you carry the operating  manual. This Camera produces some noisy  pictures ,and has dull colors . The viewfinder  during lowlight conditions has noise in it.  The firmware update being blamed is already on most new fz100s. (The FZ-35 or FZ40 Image Quality might make most happy). 6-9-11 Ive done more research and can say if you use it other then in IA auto it is possible to get better images, this Camera has a longer learning Curve then most. (If your a person that likes manual operating of a Camera its Probably a 4 Star for you). I take 1 star away for the chip in the battery that forces people to buy a Panasonic battery instead of a Generic for the battery meter to work.", "\"Where to begin... First, read Rolla \"\"Ken\"\" Gravett's extensive review here on the FZ100.  His review is way more detailed than mine will be. However I'll cover a few items that I really love about this camera as well as a couple with which I'm less thrilled.IMAGE FORMAT - I love that I can take photos in 16:9 format to match my HDTV and wide screen PC monitor sizes.  That's very cool.IMAGE QUALITY - I've compared shots taken from the same spot with my Nikon D40 and the FZ100, and frankly I don't see much difference.  I generally shoot outdoors on the FZ100 with a maximum ISO setting of 400, typically at ISO 100, and usually with a \"\"Moose's warm Polarizing filter\"\" left over from my Nikon days.  I also generally limit my pixel setting to 7.5 since I NEVER print anything larger than 11\"\" x 14\"\" and rightly or wrongly I feel 7.5 megapixels is plenty to give me a quality image.  So in short, I've been quite pleased by the image quality from this camera.  To each his/her own.  I see very little difference between the images from my several past Nikon's and Nikon lenses and the images from this camera.ZOOM LENS - The zoom capability with this lens is simply astonishing. I shot a photo of a friend's 37 foot Tayana yacht from a dock further down river.  In the widest angle setting I could barely pick out the distinctive cream color of the hull on his boat.  As I zoomed closer, more of the vessel came into view.  At maximum zoom I COULD NOT ONLY READ HIS Sea Gypsy NAME, I COULD ALSO CLEARLY READ \"\"San Francisco\"\" in small print beneath the name Sea Gypsy!  I read somewhere that the total zoom capability on this camera is the 35mm camera equivalent of from 25mm to over 1200mm!!!  Used on a tripod, or even a monopod at a sporting event, or for nature photography, wow!  Imagine the possibilities.  Using two heavy lenses on my Nikons my range was from 28mm to 200mm!HD VIDEO - I shot videos at a concert recently featuring the remarkably talented and beautiful Nicki Parrott.  These are available on YouTube.  They were shot handheld using available light only, and the on-camera built-in stereo microphone.  See what you think.  Look for the CACSJ series (here's one:  [...] I'm pretty happy with them.  By the way, shooting in the Motion JPEG mode while restricted to 720p and requiring a LOT more space on your SD card provides a MUCH brighter picture so I ALWAYS use MJPEG mode for available light indoor shots.  AVCHD may be okay outdoors, but forget using it in low light conditions.I bought an external Alzden stereo mic for the camera, and have yet to really test it in a crowded environment, but it works fine AS LONG AS you buy a 3.5mm to 2.5mm converter!!!  This is a MUST in order to use anyone's external mic other than Panasonic's very expensive offering.MAJOR GRIPES - There are three:1. Panasonic provides a camera that records video in High Definition, and then only provides a crappy COMPOSITE (\"\"RCA\"\" style red-white-yellow) cable to connect the FZ100 camera to a TV set.  Hello, Panasonic!  It's the 21st Century, not 1950.  This means you have to buy an extra cost HDMI cable if you want to view your HD videos on an HDTV set in High Definition!  AND for older HD sets that don't have HDMI input slots, there is NO HD COMPONENT cable available anywhere, including from Panasonic, that will fit the FZ100!  The Panasonic Component Cable available for prior model cameras and camcorders WILL NOT FIT THE FZ100!  Thanks a lot, Panasonic, for CHANGING the slot size on the FZ100.  Duh!  Since our 50\"\" Samsung HD DLP set will only accept COMPONENT cable for producing a signal in High Definition, that means I can't view my FZ100 HD videos in High Def on the Samsung because it doesn't accept HDMI cables.  VERY frustrating to record videos in HD and have to view them on my large screen DLP HD TV in \"\"LOW\"\" Definition only!2. Aftermarket batteries do not as of this writing let you know how much charge they have left in them, and some don't even work at all.  Therefore, stick to the EXPENSIVE Panasonic brand batteries for backup.  I paid $60 for mine, but they have come down in price a little by now, and they do run for a longgggg time before dying.3. The little red \"\"record video\"\" button is difficult to engage.  At a rehearsal of our little jazz trio last night I lost two videos because I thought I was recording after having pressed the red record button, but instead AFTER the set when I thought I was turning OFF the recording button I actually was only then turning it ON so I got some great shots of the ceiling, etc., but no music.  Be sure you see the little icon of a movie projector on the display screen before you assume you are recording videos!OVERALL - I LOVE this camera, in spite of the few accessories gripes.  The image quality is fine, the zoom range is incredible, it's small, but seems sturdily built, and once one starts becoming familiar with it's 240 page owner's manual, it is a powerful tool for any photographer.  And it shoots in RAW as well as JPG or RAW AND JPG for those who like to fool around working with RAW processing.  I highly recommend this camera.\"", "\"I've had a few days to play with the new DMC-FZ100, and for the most part, the results are good. Let me first say before anything, if you're expecting DSLR quality photographs with this or any other 'Super Zoom', it isn't going to happen. Since I already own the FZ35, most of the FZ100's features are familiar to me. The FZ100's best feature is its 25-600mm LEICA Lens. I also prefer its wider angle compared to the FZ35's 27mm. Panasonic's POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) does a great job up to about 18X zoom. When you're zooming at full length, don't expect miracles. It helps, but you'll still need a fairly steady hand and fairly high shutter speeds to get the best pics. Panasonic's iA mode does a very good job as usual, but still tends to sometimes use a higher ISO than necessary. I prefer \"\"P\"\" mode with a little manual tweaking of various settings. Most people will consider the FZ100's 3\"\" free-angle LCD a big improvement over the FZ35's fixed 2.7\"\" screen. I haven't played around much with the FZ100's video yet, but from what I've taken, it seems to be at least equal to the FZ35. All this leads to me to my biggest disappointment I have with the FZ100. Image quality just isn't as good as the FZ35 under any circumstances. It doesn't mean that the FZ100 isn't capable of taking 'good' pictures, just that my older FZ35 takes better pictures. I've tried just about every setting combination possible and the FZ35 still wins. I'm not overly surprised though, since they're cramming 14.1 MP into a small sensor. Too bad marketing dictates increasing MP count with every new camera. If the FZ100 was 10 MP, it would probably produce excellent images instead of just good.  With that being said, the FZ100's results still are good, and from what I've seen from the other 20+X Zoom cameras, it still beats them. If you're not expecting DSLR results, and aren't obsessed with \"\"pixel peeping\"\", than I recommend the DMC-FZ100. If you're thinking of upgrading from the FZ35 like I did, you'll have to ask yourself if the 24x wider zoom and other improvements are worth sacrificing some image quality.Pros:24X 25-600mm LEICA Lens3\"\" free-angle LCDPOWER O.I.S.

I'm not disappointed.  I made many of the adjustmentsto the settings as recommended and find that it takes excellent picture once these adjustments were made.  The imagequality is not up to a DSLR, but that shouldn't be expected.  It has some problems in low light and as long as I keepthe ISO below 400 and make the recommended adjustments based on the various reviews recommendations it takes great photos.The video works well also including the 1080i settings.  I've used the P setting with manual adjustments which are sufficientto allow for good photos.  I've used the RAW setting also, and used Photoshop Elements 8 to make jpgs also of excellent quality.I would like to have RAW support in the DxO software that is available to enable even better photos with this camera.  It ismuch lighter weight that a DSLR and thus is available for photography much more often.  It also shoots photos very quicklyand is always ready to shoot.  Learning to use the 24x zoom is taking some practice as I am not be able to follow a quicklymoving object very easily.", "\"I bought this camera because of the claim that it had high speed video and high quality HD video.  The video produced was terrible.  First in the HD video you get \"\"jello jiggles\"\" anytime you are panning or trying to follow action.  Second, the only speed offered in the high speed was 240 frames per second and at QVGA resolution.  I tried to use the camera to analyze a tennis serve. The pixalization was so extreme that you couldn't see the tennis ball hit the strings.  Terrible quality.I also checked the quality of the still shots.  I was amazed at how bad it was.  I took a picture of my daughter and when I cropped it I found that her hair was just a muddled mass of brown.  Found a reviewer online that pointed out the same problem with any fine detail.  It may offer 14 MP, but you can beat the IQ with 10 MP cameras from all the other vendors.  Oh, and the claimed 11 frames per second was just a claim.  Measured closer to 8 or 9.  Noted in one review that if you only used the RAW pictures you could get better quality.  Of course you have to then convert the RAW to JPG or TIFF if you want to post them or use them. Definitely not a feature, just a work around that takes a lot of work.  This also doesn't help with the poor video quality.The physical camera was great.  Wonderful handling, could take a filter, came with a hood, easy to use.  Too bad they didn't spend a little money on the Image Quality.I had bought a Casio Exlim EX-FH25Casio EX-FH25 10.1MP High Speed Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Zoom with CMOS Shift Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCDfirst, but it was defective and had to go back.  I thought I would just upgrade to the Panasonic instead trying another Casio.  The Casio had a range of high speed video options and it's resolution and IQ at 240 fps were very usable.  It also offered 120 fps and 60 fps as options (as well as a totally unusable 1,000 fps).  It only offered 720p HD video, but the quality was very good.Comparing pictures and videos taken with the two cameras, the Casio had superior IQ in all of my person samples.  The Casio didn't have some of the handling features of the Panasonic, but it is $100 cheaper. Much better choice if you want a camera to take action pictures.Amazon was great about taking the camera back.  No wonder I buy everything directly from Amazon.  I am going to wait until March when all the new 2011 cameras are available to try to find a camera that is good for action photography and video.\"", "\"Bought the fz40 and sent back.....Couple bucks more and got a much better camera! What did that other customer mean about \"\"Chip\"\"? Bought a 2million dollar bag and the camera fits very snug....You can also stuff charger and extra battery...Very small..... I would NOT put my camera in checked in luggage...So this is perfecto..\"", "\"I usually order from Amazon. I had originally pre-ordered this camera from Amazon, but canceled and ordered from J&R; - an Amazon seller where it was in stock.I have had my FZ100 for about 4 days now. I really haven't had a long enough period to become a real smooth operator yet. In the time that I have spent exploring a few of the many features, I have been quite impressed. I started out with using just the iA mode. Venturing out from there mostly in the \"\"P\"\" mode, I have explored:1. The optical zoom vs. extend optical zoom - amazing range/clarity2. Using with my neck mounted mini tripod - adds steadying effect for long zooms3. The macro mode - outstanding sharpness4. The multi-angle LCD and the viewfinder - adds flexibility5. Using face recognition - unique feature that works6. Stabilizer vs. no stabilizer - definitely works well7. Timer use to reduce shake in zoom shots - a 2 second lag allows firming of the camera before shot8. Using the burst mode - fast, fast, fast - having the choice of shots is very handy9. The travel destination option - unique, allows you to plan ahead (destination, days and local time)10. Using the auto bracket mode - gives you a range of exposures in the burst mode11. Using the HD AVCHD modes - both modes make outstanding videos (better than my ZS3)12. Setting  the maximum ISO settings - helps controls noise in low light13. Using the flash vs. no flash - flash is pretty powerful  (stronger than my ZS3)14. Manual focus mode - it works, with practice it will be quite handy15. The 3 custom settings - allow setting up 3 comprehensive camera modes for personal preference -- niceI have tried to get away from comparing the camera pixel to pixel image quality. I realize that this camera does not have the absolute best image, but it does take very good pictures! In low light the MOS sensor is not quite as good as the CCD sensor, but limiting the ISO and the use of the viewfinder or tripod does help to handle the noise.I have tried out four other cameras before buying the FZ100. The closest to my preferences was the Canon SX20, but to me it lacked many of the FZ100's useful features, it was slower and menu access was more difficult. The Lumix FZ-35 was also a fine camera, but was much slower and lacked features that I wanted.  Both the Nikon P100 and the Fuji HS10 seem to be fine cameras, but lacked refinement as compared to either the Panasonic or the Canon models.After working with a number of the available features in the FZ100, I have become very impressed with the seamless nature of this camera. To incorporate so many advanced features with convenient controls into the camera and still maintain its ease of use seems truly amazing to me. For my needs this camera was a great choice.Remember though, impressions tend to be subjective.My cams:  Lumix ZS3, Lumix FZ100, Lumix LZ10S(wife), Canon Optura 300\"", "For this level of camera it's blazing fast at everything it does.  The IQ of the MOS sensor has suffered a little over the CCD quality of the FZ35/40's. This is a tradeoff of having to allow for the faster needed processing of the MOS sensor for the 1920x1080 HD video. But if your not pixel peeping you probably won't see a difference.The overall colors of the FZ100 just jump out there compared to my FZ35. Sure you can PP to whatever but having those native colors in RAW is impressive.Also being able to shoot 2-10 fps burst singles with a full AF on each shot up to 5 fps, WHILE SHOOTING HD VIDEO is impressive.  The processing power in this little camera is blazing fast. I would say the FZ100 is at least 3 times faster at processing/write times versus my FZ35. I can shoot 10 shots with the FZ100 while the FZ35 is still writing the 3rd shot.  The AF is faster as well.  The whole camera is just way faster than the FZ35.  I don't own the new FZ40 so I can't say about it.When people are comparing the FZ35/40 versus the FZ100, I don't see too many mention the speed of the amazing FZ100.  Until you have owned both you really can't quantify the speed difference.  But once you actually physically compare, the FZ100 just leaps out with superior performance. IMHO, this extra processing/AF speed is a much overlooked attribute of the FZ100.For outright IQ of the singles there probably are a few cameras in this range which can top the FZ100, but for overall features and speed I don't think there is a better value than the FZ100.My FZ35 can slightly out resolve the FZ100, but the difference is much smaller than I had originally thought. The FZ100 is one camera that does reward the user for getting to know her. Even if you're totally a manual type, try the differene scene/function modes.  You might be suprised at how close they come to what you had intended with full manual adjustments.BTW, don't forget to check the firmware as Panasonic has issued version 1.2 for download.  Also be sure and try the included PhotoStudio software especially for the HD video.  I usually never even bother with these factory free programs but this time it gave a much smoother flow and truer colors than a couple $100 video programs I already own.Rather than be too redundant as to what others have already stated, I'll just say, BUY IT!!!kd", "Took awhile to get things set properly.  Recommend that digital zoom feature be turned off.  The viewfinder tends to give impression that image is great when it enlarged too much and finished picture looks bad.  Great images can be made with it off.  If subject is too far away, reducing picture size will enlarge it (bring it in closer) and still give satisfactory sharpness and detail.Initially, I did not like the camera, but after getting it set properly it has become my favorite.  This was purchased as a backup for my first one.  14MP gives great details, especially on macro shots and images at less than full zoom.", "I am a camera user who doesn't like to read manuals.  I don't know all the ins and outs of photography, lighting, lenses and camera lingo. I just need to take great pictures easily.  And this camera does that.  I take pictures of nature, of family and close-up shots of jewelry I make for my website.  This camera has excelled in all 3.  So if you need great pictures without a lot of knowledge needed, this is a great camera for you.  It might be great if you are a camera guru too! :-)", "\"I am updating this review constantly so check back every so often to see any additional updates or new material has been added to this review.

The comments area in general is packed with good information about tips for better shooting and products to buy to make the process better.  Check them out!First, let me tell you I have read every single review about this camera on the Amazon website.  I was torn between this camera and theCanon SX30IS 14.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 Inch Wide LCDand the newFujifilm FinePix HS20 16 MP Digital Camera with EXR BSI CMOS High Speed Sensor and Fujinon 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens.  I also looked at theFujifilm FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD, but didn't like it because after the picture was taken it takes 3-4 seconds to process before another picture can be taken.  I currently own the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 as well, and used it as a comparison camera with the DMC-FZ100.  I am still in the process of comparing photos of both cameras with the settings exactly the same, and so far the FZ100 wins.This camera has a an excellent 25mm Ultra Wide-Angle Lexica DC Vario-Elmarit lens w 24X optical zoom, high speed Venus Engine 3 core processor, full HD movie recording at 1920 X 1080 resolution at 60 frames per second, High Speed Video recording at 220 frames per second, the fastest level of burst shooting of any bridge camera at 2,5,11 (2, 5,and 11 fps at full 14mp resolution),40, and 60 fps,  shutter release lag of 0.008 seconds (WOW!), 14 mp resolution, and the camera's quick response makes it easier to capture sudden, spur-of-the-moment photo opportunities together with the Sonic Speed AF (auto focus). Thanks to newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology, with the Intelligent Zoom turned on, the DMC-FZ100 has a camera zoom range of 1 - 32X, or a 35mm camera equivalent of 25-780mm at maximum 14mp picture size!  No one makes a camera like this one!  No one even comes close!I have been in photography for many years.  I've done wedding photography and sold some of my photos on line and to some local shops.  I had a photography studio in my basement.  I currently use a Nikon D90 as a DSLR camera.  I enjoy the ease of taking a bridge camera with me instead of hauling the huge camera and bag full of lenses.  I use the Panasonic cameras strictly for taking photos for myself as the quality is not the same as with the Nikon D90. Don't get me wrong.  It takes a great picture!  But you just can't compare a bridge camera to a DSLR.  You can't compare the price either.  MY D90 cost me almost $1000 and the lenses are just as expensive.  Some cost way more than the camera body.  Have you bought a 25-780mm lens for a DSLR camera lately?  If they were available they would cost thousands of dollars!  That's the lens equivalent of the Panasonic DMC-FZ100 with I-Zoom ON!The Panasonic DMC-FZ100 is getting a lot of negative reviews about picture quality.  I decided to buy the camera anyway and see if it could be useful to me.  I liked the 35X zoom of the Canon SX30IS, but there are lots of negative reviews concerning its picture quality as well.  The Panasonic DMC-FZ100 has many qualities and features that puts it above the Canon, but the 35X really pulled on me.  I will explain the qualities of the FZ100 in a minute.  The new Fujifilm Finepix HS20 really caught my eye!  The main reason I decided against that camera is the zoom is manual and the price tag is much higher than the FZ100.  The zoom being manual makes any video jerky while it is being zoomed.  I looked at some of the videos taken with it on YouTube.  Just do a search on that site.The PDF manual for this camera can be downloaded from the Panasonic web site. Just do a search for it in Google.  I put the link for the PDF in the comments section in case you want to download it.I gave the camera an in depth checkout and came away totally pleased with it.  Let me tell you all the benefits and features of this great camera:What I like:It has threads for filters.  It takes a 52mm filter and they are readily available. Zeikos makes a 52mm polarizing filterZeikos ZE-CPL52 52mm Multi-Coated Circular Polarizer Filter.  I bought one for my FZ35 a while back.  I also bought a more expensive Hoya polarizing filter and cannot see any difference between the Zeikos filter and the Hoya filter.  Save your money and get the Zeikos.The lens hood is included and uses a slot instead of screwing on.  It is much faster to install or remove.Some of the above cameras charge extra for the lens hood.The camera takes JPG or Raw pictures or Both.In the Video Mode, single still pictures or burst pictures can be taken just by pressing down on the shutter release button while taking the video.  It takes a 3.5mp picture or pictures, up to 40 per video. To set up the burst mode just select it on top of the camera next to the main dial and set it up before taking the video.  Page 110 in the manual.In the Video Mode you can normally zoom to 24X. However if you select and turn on I-Zoom the camera will zoom to 32X.  I-Zoom gives you 1.3X the normal zoom.  The setting also gives you 32X in the Picture Mode (at 14mp picture size).  It makes the camera in both picture mode and video mode equivalent to a 35mm camera 25-780mm lens! The picture quality in video or photo is not diminished in this mode. It says it on page 58 and 145 in the manual.To turn I-Zoom on, just go to Menu, REC MENU, Page 3 (Change pages up by moving the zoom switch right, and down by moving the zoom switch left) , select I.R I.Resolution, then select I Zoom.  After that, when using the Video Mode, instead of zooming to 24X, the camera will zoom to 32X.  In the picture mode, the zoom goes from 24X in the 14mp Mode to 32X.  If you set the camera in the 10mp picture size, the zoom goes from 24X to 37.9X.  Now the camera is actually zooming in more than the Canon SX30IS!  The best part!  Using the I Zoom and Extended Optical Zoom does not degrade picture quality at all!  Go to the manual on page 58 and 145.  It tells you that right in the manual!I-Zoom = Multiplier of 1.3XExtended Optical Zoom with I-Zoom ON14mp = 32X10mp = 37.9X7mp = 45X5mp = 54X3mp = 67.4XI used the camera at 3mp (67.4X) with the Olympus 1.7 teleconverter to get a total zoom of 118X, and took a picture of the moon with just a monopod.  It filled the whole screen without cropping.  It can be seen at the web site listed in comments.  The picture looks great!  I will be taking another with a tripod when the moon is full, and will post it as well.The camera has a live Histogram which the FZ35 has as well.  To turn it on, go to MENU, SETUP, Page 3, HISTOGRAM, and turn it ON.The camera will take 5 quick flash shots!  To do that, just put the top main dial to SCN Mode, and select FLASH BURST, which is on the second row!  The FZ35 does that too.  While we are in the SCN Mode, in a dim setting like inside at night, select the CANDLE LIGHT Mode,  It really brightens up the picture!  Better yet, at night in tough lighting, select iA Mode (Intelligent Auto) with the camera main dial.  It does a great job in dim light, but you will sacrifice some noise!  Also note in SCN mode, go to the second page of the menu and select HS Mode for High Speed Video to take those fast action videos that you want to get great slow motion detail in.  The speed is 220 frames per second!460,000 pixel 3 inch LCD, which extends and swivels.  You can even take a picture of yourself and see what it is going to look like before you take the shot.  Just extend the screen and rotate it 180 degrees.DIFFERENT COLOR MODES = Page 132 of manualThe camera has several different color modes.STANDARD:  The standard settingDYNAMIC: The saturation and contrast are increased.NATURE: Brighter red, green and blue.  Enhanced beauty of nature.SMOOTH: The contrast is lowered for smoother and clearer color.VIBRANT :  Higher saturation and contrast than DYNAMIC.Makes the colors snap out at you!There are a couple of others.To Set the COLOR MODE go to P or A or S or M mode on the main dial, press MENU, then FILM MODE, then push the right button on the MENU SET switch to cycle through the various color modes. Once in a mode, scroll down and set the CONTRAST, SHARPNESS, SATURATION, and NOISE REDUCTION.  Once set, press the MENU button again to save it.By going to the FILM MODE (MENU, REC MODE, Page 1, FILM MODE)  you are able to customize your setting of CONTRAST, SHARPNESS, SATURATION, and NOISE REDUCTION and set it on a custom menu.  Just select your settings and continue scrolling down to Memory and set your custom menu there.It has a flash shoe, and uses Panasonic Flashes.  There are three to choose from but they can get real expensive!Panasonic DMW-FL360 External Flash (GN36) for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital Camera,Panasonic DMW-FL500 TTL External Flash for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital CameraAVCHD Video, either 1080i, or 720p, 60 frames per second, or Motion JPEG. The video in 1080 or 720 AVCHD can be processed and played in Windows 7 Media Player and does not skip or flicker.  The video is very clear and looks outstanding.  Also there is no time limit in these AVCHD modes in the camera.  It will take the video till the memory card is full.I have read on some reviews that the video is jumpy and simply not good.  This is because they are probably using older computers.  I had this problem with my old computer as well. It would not play HD at all and some of the higher settings of regular video would be jumpy and not good.  This is because your computer is just not fast enough to play HD video.  First of all, you need a HD video monitor.  You need a good fast graphics card and a fast computer.  If it doesn't play on your computer it is not the camera's fault. This camera has outstanding HD video.  It simply looks awesome!  Windows 7 Media Player works great with AVCHD movie files.Can use teleconverter lenses with adapterLens Adapter, which allows use of 55mm lenses.Olympus TCON-1.7x Telephoto Converter LensCan use External Mike if neededBURST MODEThe selector is on top of the camera, next to the Main Dial.It allows selection of 2 fps (frames per second), 5 fps, 11 fps, 40 fps, or 60 fps.  In 40 and 60 fps the camera uses an electronic shutter, not a mechanical one.  It uses a mechanical shutter on all speeds 11 fps and under.  At 40 fps, the picture size is 5M and at 60 fps the picture size is 3.5m.  The camera will take 5 fps pictures with continuous Auto Focus!I was able to take 15 pictures straight in just over a second at the picture size of 14mp in the 11 fps mode.  In the 40 and 60 fps mode the camera sounds like a high tech machine gun!  WOW!Picture QualityThere has been a lot written about the poor picture quality of this camera and I checked it out thoroughly.  First of all, I usually set the ISO to manual and set it to 100.  That is where you will always get the best picture.  I did the same for my FZ35.  If used in ISO Auto, I would set the limit to ISO 400.  These cameras are noisy if you let the ISO get up too high.  This camera is not any worse or better than the FZ35.  I took some pictures inside at night with available lighting.  The first pictures I took in the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode.  The pictures looked all right, but were noisy.  The second set of pictures I took was in Aperture Priority with the aperture set to maximum (f/2.8) and they look a lot cleaner with much less noise.  The ISO was set to 100. If you want the best possible pictures set the ISO low and use either P (Program) or A (Aperture) or S (Shutter)  or M (Manual) Modes.  It is the same with the FZ35.  No different there.I did a test.  I took one picture in the iA mode and the second in the A (Aperture) Mode, with the Aperture set to maximum , which was f/3.4 at zoom 3X.  The picture in Aperture Mode had a lot less noise.  I posted the pictures on line and the link to see them is in the comments section.The bottom line:  The FZ100 takes a great picture!  Just use one of the priority modes and keep your ISO low.  The pictures are in some ways better than the pictures I took with the FZ35.  The colors of the FZ100 look more accurate than the FZ35.  I compared these pictures pixel peeping like mad, blowing up the pictures a lot to see the difference.  I like the FZ100 pictures better.  Just look at the writing on top of the drill or the SKIL logo on the screwdriver.  Next to the SKIL logo is a trademark R.  Can't read it in the FZ35 picture.  Look at the drill bits.  They look way sharper in the FZ100 picture.  Check it out for yourself.  Don't believe what I say.  Make your own determination.  Go to the link in the comments section, which takes you to flickr, blow up the pictures to original size and judge for yourself.  The only way I could judge one camera's pictures over the other is to blow them way up.  At normal picture size there is no way you could pick one over the other .  There just isn't that much difference.  Some people are saying they can see the difference in quality.  I don't see it and fail to see how they could see any difference in quality between these two cameras at a normal picture display size with both cameras set up exactly the same way. The pictures are definitely more noisy in the iA mode even with the ISO set to 100.Check out other FZ100 pictures on the flickr website.  Just go there and do a search for the PANASONIC DMC-FZ100.  There are bunches of great photos.  Some of them are simply stunning! Some of the insect pictures are amazing!The camera has excellent stabilization.  I was able to take great clear (not blurry) hand held pictures of a sign, at about 100 yards away in my yard.  The camera set to 10mp and the zoom set at 37.9, and it was a late afternoon on a sunny day.If you use this camera to print 8X10 photos, there is really no need to set the picture size for any higher than 10mp.  As a matter of fact the camera says if you print 8 X 10, the recommended setting is 5mp.  I used to print excellent quality 8 X 10 and larger pictures with a 6mp DSLR camera.  In the camera at 14mp mode, it says that size is for prints 16 X 20 inches.  For 10mp the size is 11 X 14 inches.FLASHSet the flash to come on any time the flash is opened.  That way when you need or want a flash just press the flash button to open the flash .  A lot of times it is proper to use the flash even during the day to fill in shadows.  Go to MENU, REC MODE, MENU 4, FLASH, and select the one with only the flash icon.  (by the way, to change from one page to the next in MENU, just pull the zoom lever to the right.  Each time you pull it right it will advance one page.  To go down,  pull the zoom lever to the left).Turn on the Continuous AF Mode in the Motion Picture (video) Mode.  To do this, go to MENU, MOTION PICTURE, CONTINUOUS AF, and select ON.  That way it will focus as you zoom.I noticed the pictures reviewed on the LCD with flash look dim when viewed, but they look fine with my picture software.  I don't know why this happens.The Olympus TCON 1.7X converter works best when the camera is zoomed to 7X to the max of 37.9X in the 10mp mode.  You have to be zoomed to about 7X or more to stop the vignetting.WHAT I DON\"\"T LIKE:I don't like having to buy Panasonic Batteries at $60 a pop.  It ticks me off that they don't allow aftermarket batteries to be used.  I had that problem with my FZ35 as well till I downloaded and installed a earlier firmware version.  I did order one battery from Ebay from a Hong Kong dealer for cheap.  I will post if it works.I also don't like the REAR DIAL on the camera.  It seems cheap and doesn't work all that well.  It seems to turn hard and if you push on it a little bit it changes the mode on you.I like the camera bag,Case Logic SLCC-2 Deluxe Camcorder Case, Color: Black and Silver.  It is big enough to hold the camera, the lenses, the batteries, the charger and still room to spare.  The price is reasonable.Well, that's it.  Check out my pictures.  I will leave the link in the comments section.  I am overjoyed at this camera!  It is awesome!Update:  1-19-11 I took pictures with the FZ35 and the FZ100 today and posted them on flickr.  Its hard to pick a winner.  The color in the FZ100 photos looks better.  The higher zoomed pictures with the FZ100 really stand out.  Be advised I took those pictures hand held.  I probably should have used a tripod or monopod.  Check them out for yourself.  I left the link in the first comments section.  It is on the bottom of the first comment. I took a moon shot of the full moon and it is posted in the same place with the comparison pictures.Update 1-22-11.  Someone sent me an email and asked my why I chose the Panasonic over the Canon.  Here's why: I considered both cameras, but here is why I chose the Panasonic. The Canon zooms to 35X and that was important to me. The Panasonic zoomed to 24X, which was a downer. I use video a lot and didn't like that at all. In doing the research on the Panasonic camera I read about I-Zoom, which when turned on makes the zoom in video and 14mp picture mode go to 32X. That leveled the playing field for me for the Panasonic. The Canon does not take video in true HD mode. It only takes video in 1920 X 720 at 30 frames per second. The Panasonic takes true HD video in 1920 X 1080 at 60 frames per second.  Plus it has a high speed video mode in which it takes 220 frames per second.  Both cameras use the 14mp sensor, which degrades picture quality somewhat, so a draw there. The Panasonic uses a 460,000 pixel LCD and the Canon uses a 230,000 pixel LCD screen. The flash recycle time on the Canon is 10 seconds. On the Panasonic it is almost instant.  In fact you can put the camera in the flash burst mode and take 5 really quick flash shots.  The killer for me is the Panasonic takes up to 11 pictures per second in the 14mp picture mode and 5 pictures per second in full auto focus mode. The Canon is a deadbeat here. It takes 1.3 shots per second in the normal mode and 0.6 frames per second with auto focus on. Soooooo Slooooowwww! Another reason I didn't take the Canon is the picture mode goes from 14mp to the next size down, which is 7mp. What happened to 10mp?  The next picture size after that is 2mp.  So disappointing. Another thing, the Panasonic Aperture goes from f/2.8 to f/11 and the Canon is f/2.7 to f/8. All those reasons is why I chose the Panasonic over the Canon, and don't regret it one bit. The Panasonic is simply the better camera!Update 1-23-11.  I posted a full HD 1920 X 1080 video on YouTube showing the full 32X zoom with I-Zoom turned on.  The link is at the bottom of the first comment.Update 1-24-11.  I discovered something very important about the camera this morning.  I tried to take HD video inside and it seems the picture is always dark in the video mode.  I had the camera in Aperture Priority and had the f/ stop set at f/2.8.  I don't know if it makes any difference in video recording.  I tried setting the ISO to 1600 to make the video lighter, but it did not help.  Finally I got an idea.  I put the camera in iA (Intelligent Auto) mode and pushed the video record.  What a difference!!!!  WOW!!!!  Now the video is light and looks great inside in low light conditions!  So, if you plan on taking a video inside, put the main dial in iA first.  It makes a world of difference!  That is not in the manual by the way.  iA does introduce noise when the lighing is low, but I would rather have some noise in my video and be able to see the action than to have a clean picture that's too dark to watch.One note:  AVCHD HD Video (the video this camera uses) is downloadable directly to YouTube without any conversion.  That's nice to know.  Many other tips and comments are in the comments section of this review.You want to know why your pictures look crappy?  You are probably in iA Mode (Intelligent Auto).  Check the settings in iA mode on page 51 and 52 of the manual.  The ISO is preset (and not adjustable) to Intelligent ISO (The ISO sensitivity is adjusted according to the movement of the subject and the brightness), and the MAX ISO SENSITIVITY is preset (and not adjustable) to ISO 1600 (ISO 6400 if MOTION DEBLUR is set to ON!). It's no wonder your pictures are so crappy!  Red Eye removal is ON.  Zoom Mike is ON.  The High ISO Limit is why you are getting crappy pictures.  Get out of the iA mode and go to one of the priority (P, A, S, M) modes of the camera.  If you are new to photography or just don't want to mess with the camera, just set it in P (Program) mode.  The camera will select shutter speed and ISO for you.  Push the MENU button and set the ISO to AUTO if you wish, and set the ISO LIMIT to 400.  To get the best pictures set the ISO to 100 and not to AUTO.  Your pictures will look great and will not be noisy.  The best part is you will find yourself really liking this camera!  Use the iA mode when you need to take a shot and it was dark and nothing else that you tried worked or you didn't have time to experiment.  If you need the to take the shot quick set the camera to iA mode, especially in bad lighting.  The camera will take the shot.  It will be noisy but it will take the shot.Update 1-27-11  Posted 6 new comparison shots of the FZ35 and FZ100 camera.  The link is posted at the bottom of the first comment.Update 1-30-11  You can save a still picture while in the video playback mode.  To do that, play the video back and view it on the LCD.  Pause the video at the point that you want the picture (to pause, hit the top button on the MENU Set toggle switch).  Press the MENU button.  It asks you \"\"Save this image?\"\"  Press YES and you are there.  SO easy!  It saves the picture in the 2mp picture size on a HD or WVGA video. Page 159 in the manual.I just ordered a macro lensRaynox DCR 150 - Converterfor this camera.  When it comes in I will let you know how well it works.  Some of the photos taken in flickr with this lens are SIMPLY STUNNING!Update 1-31-11  I got the Raynox DCR-150 macro lens in today and all I can say is WOW!  It attaches directly to the camera lens.  The macro is way way way better and stronger than the macro that comes with the camera.  I have posted the link to some pictures I took with it at the bottom of the first comment.  HAPPY HAPPY!  This lens just knocks it out of the park!Update 2-1-11  Oh, one thing I forgot to tell you.  If you copy all the picture files on your SDHC card to your computer and want to get rid of them, never format the card in your computer. Formatting the card in your computer can corrupt the card and it will not work in your camera anymore.  Your computer uses NTFS format and your camera uses FAT32.  I have several articles that explain such and will post the links in the first comment area if anyone wants to see them.  Always format the SDHC card in the camera.  The quickest way to format the card is to go to MENU, scroll down to SETUP, go to PAGE 6 (just turn the zoom lever left two times to go to PAGE 6), scroll down to FORMAT, and push the right button on your MENU toggle switch and select YES to \"\"Delete All Data From the Memory Card\"\".I also recommend you back up your pictures to a different hard drive for safe keeping.  I use a USB hard drive that holds 1.5 Tera bites (1500 Mega Bites).  They are fairly inexpensive and can save your butt if your hard drive ever fails.  I know.  I lost 3000 pictures one time because the computer power supply crashed and took out both my computer hard drives. I had my pictures backed up on both drives.  It really hurt! If you go on a long extended trip it is worth it to back up your cards to a card drive.  A really good one is a Nexto DI NEXTO eXtreme3 500GB Digital Hi-Speed OTG Backup Storage.  Mine holds 500 mega bites.  I used it while on vacation in Vietnam for about 3 weeks.  I took over 7000 pictures and over 500 videos.  This brand of card reader is not cheap, but it is worth every penny.  It's really fast too.Update 2-3-11 I just got a new flash for the camera. It is a Vivitar DF-383. It works great with the FZ100 camera. It works in the TTL mode and shows camera aperture, ISO setting, F/stop, and zoom in mm. It can be used as a slave and has a power saving function. It is a powerful flash (Guide number (ISO 100) 45 meters/148 feet at 85mm position). It also shuts off when the camera is powered down. I posted some photos on Flickr from the flash.  The item was 25 feet away and was shot in Aperture Priority, ISO 100 at different zoom settings.  The link is at the bottom of the first comment.Update 2-9-11  A friend of mine just told me about a remote shutter release cable that you can hook up to the camera to take macro or telephoto shots without camera shake. It is so much easier than setting the timer to take the picture every time. He bought his on Ebay. Amazon has the Panasonic cord, but it is really expensive.  Panasonic DMW-RSL1 Remote Shutter Release. Here is a much cheaper alternative from Amazon. I will post the link to the product in the first comment.Update 2-13-11  This is a big time update!  I have found that taking HD video inside at night to be pretty disappointing with the FZ100.  I took some video in HD with my FZ35 and it looks good.  It is plenty bright enough.  The FZ100 if set in HD 1080 or 720 the video is really dark.  I tried setting the ISO higher. No help.  I tried just about everything without any success.  The only solution is to set the camera in iA mode.  The picture is much brighter, but full of noise.Well, I found a solution!  This makes it much better!  Set the camera RECORD MODE to MOTION JPG and REC QUALITY to HD and set the ISO to 400.  Wow what a difference!  It is soooooooo much better and brighter.  It is about the same as my FZ35.  The only problem with MOTION JPG is it will only record 8 minutes in this mode.  If you choose the WVGA mode instead of HD it will record for 20 minutes. It may not be the best solution but it will allow good videos in low light at night.Update 2-22-11.  I just read an article that says the NOISE REDUCTION is one reason the picture quality on the FZ100 is not as good.  It says to shut the Noise Reduction down.  Here is how you do that:Go to one of the shooting modes other than iA. Go to A priority for example. Push the Menu Set button. Select FILM MODE (top one on page 1).  Change your mode by pushing the button on the right of the menu set switch. I have mine on VIBRANT. Select whatever mode you want. Then move the highlighter down to Contrast (I use +1), SHARPNESS (I use +1), VIBRANT (I use +1) and NOISE REDUCTION (I use -2). Then push the menu set again and that's it. Turn the NOISE REDUCTION as low as it will go as it will screw up your picture quality.Update 2-24-11  This comment is going to be about the Vivitar Flash (external flash) on the FZ100. The FZ40 will never get pictures like the ones I am posting because it has no hot shoe and no external flash can be used. The pictures with the camera flash are the only pictures the FZ40 will ever get. Those who have the FZ100, get ready for a pleasant surprise. I took 6 photos. 3 with the camera flash and 3 with the Vivitar DF-383. The first set was at a zoom of 1X. The second set used a zoom of 24X at 30 feet, and the last set was zoomed at 37.9X, and about 38 feet away from the object. The camera was set to Aperture Priority and ISO 100. Feast your eyes on this:  Go to the bottom of the first comment for the link.Update 3-15-11.  I know this camera has gobs of zoom, but can you ever get enough?  I have the Olympus TCON 1.7X teleconverter.  Today I got the Raynox 2.2X teleconverter and did a comparison between the two.  If you are a birder or do long range photography you might want to check out this comparison.  The explanation and the link to Flickr is in the bottom of my first comment.Update 3-27-11.  I tried using the lens hood a couple of times and didn't like the way it fit.  It seemed the fit was loose.  After just reading another comment from another review, I tried the lens hood again.  This time I turned it a little harder and it clicked.  When it clicks it is going to stay put and will not come off.  The best part is you can mount the lens hood backwards on the camera.  Once again, make sure it clicks.  It will not come off by itself.  The lens hood in this way will always be with the camera, ready to use, but not in the way of adding filters or close up lenses or polarizing filters.Noise reduction.  This camera needs noise reduction software when taking shots with high ISO.  See my bottom of the 1st comment about that to see how great these programs work.Photo FlashIn taking a flash with the built in flash, the camera tends to go up in ISO instead of increasing the flash power which gives very bad picture full of noise. It is therefore important to lock the ISO sensitivity.  I would set the ISO to no more than 400, and preferably to 100 and increase the flash power, you see the pictures will be 100 times better. To increase the flash power, set the camera in Aperture Priority (any of the 4 main priorities), push the button above the MENU SET button. If you push it one time it goes to EXPOSURE, push it again and it goes to AUTO BRACKET, push it again and it goes to FLASH. Set the flash to anything from 0.1 to +2 for more power. It makes a big difference! Set it up that way and take a couple of shots and see for yourself. Go ahead, try it out on your camera right now. Take a shot at +1 and another at +2. Don't forget to set it back to its original position when done. Back to exposure. If the pictures look too dark, also increase the EXPOSURE.Update 4-21-11  A feature that I find invaluable about this camera is the ability to save a picture from a video shot with the camera.  What a great feature to have!  You shoot a video and find yourself wanting a snapshot of something in the video.  You can get that picture!  Just play the video back in the camera, and at the point or near the point where you want the snapshot, hit the pause button (the button on top of the MENU SET button).  Once paused, you can move forward or backwards by pushing the button to the right and to the left of the MENU SET button.  Once you are at the point where you want the picture, push the MENU SET button.  It will ask SAVE THIS IMAGE?  Highlight YES, and it is done.  I will save the picture at a small picture size of 2.0mp.Update 5-8-11.  Don't connect the camera to the computer and risk damaging it.  Pull your SDHC card out of the camera (it takes a whole 1/10 second to pull your card out of the camera, just open the door and push on it) and put it into the computer if your computer has a SDHC card reader. The software supplied with the camera will know you put the card into a reader and it will prompt you to download the files, both video and photo.  If your computer doesn't have a SDHC card reader, buy a good inexpensive USB card reader.  They are only around $15 or so.  It is much faster and safer and less hassle to pull your card out of the camera to download the files.  Just do it.Update 7/27/11.  This update is a game changer for this camera.  It is no longer as weak in dark places, and the inboard flash is enough\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.000139455747557804, 0.00013890980335418135, 0.0001497743505751714, 0.0006158000905998051, 0.005872185342013836, 0.0007525419932790101, 0.10215888917446136, 0.00021061829465907067, 0.00024502427550032735, 0.3944045603275299, 0.009606475941836834, 0.48570579290390015]]}
