In short, Ghost of Sparta delivers just what you'd expect. A fun ride, lots of killing, naked women and huge bosses. It excels in the few spots that Chains of Olympus faltered, and successfully brings the entire God of War package to the PSP.The first scene quickly cements Kratos' drive to once again rebel against Athena's words and unleash his fury. A violent vision  recalls a day long forgotten. The day that Deimos, Kratos' brother was snatched away while Kratos looked on, unable to help. Kratos' sole drive in Ghost of Sparta is to rectify that mistake and find Deimos.From the onset you're thrust into the action, controlling a miniaturized Kratos on board a sea faring ship crawling with blade wielding baddies determined to kill you. You slash your way through the hoards using Kratos' iconic Blades of Athena, chaining familiar and new gory combos on ground and in air. New to Kratos' moveset is a running tackle, followed by a barrage of punches. If done without interruption, you can mock your victim as Kratos brutally tears him apart. It isn't long before you face Ghost of Sparta's first boss, the gigantic and menacing Scylla in the first bout of a 2 round battle. Though not as epic as the Hydra or the Colossus, the Scylla serves as a great opening battle to Ghost of Sparta.True to the original format as directed by David Jaffe, Ghost of Sparta's combat is easy to grasp and violently satisfying. Newcomers will be chaining combos and decimating colossal mythic monsters in no time. The button commands are virtually unchanged, so for vets such as myself, getting into GOS was no sweat. The Blades of Athena control as fluidly as ever, allowing you to pull off brutal kills on foe after foe as easily as in any other God of War title. You're also given the new Arms of Sparta; a shield and a large spear useful for taking out distant enemies. Fans of the hit film 300 will be glad to know that GOS pays homage, and includes the famous This is Sparta frontal Kick as one of Kratos' devastating attacks. Unfortunately no, Kratos doesn't yell out \"\"For Sparta!\"\" Perhaps next time? There is one glaring problem that wasn't present in past titles. While fighting various foes at once, sometimes they will attack from out of view. They're there but not on screen, which makes it very difficult to time blocks and dodges, especially when you're fighting Wraiths that dig under ground and lunge at you. On higher difficulties, they can prove to be one hell of a frustrating enemy. Not just frustrating, but I want to throw my PSP at a wall frustrating. That'd kill them in one shot for sure, but then i'd be down a PSP. There will be plenty of battles in GOS that will have you seeing the \"\"You're Dead\"\" screen multiple times, (the guys carrying the blue orbs will give you migraines) but that's what makes it so much fun. It's difficult and damn near impossible in some sections toward the end, but for the most part it's manageable. Ready At Dawn did an excellent job of shrinking Kratos' psychotic rage and bringing it to the PSP, but we already knew of RAD's prowess didn't we? Ready At Dawn also created 2008`s God of War: Chains of Olympus and Daxter.Ghost of Sparta also answers the age old question of what happened to the City of Atlantis. Well, Kratos got really pissed off and sank it. No seriously, GOS takes place in Atlantis as it's sinking giving the player a remarkable view of an overflowing volcano, just before it destroys the city. Shortly thereafter we visit Kratos' home, Sparta, in what is one of the series' best moments in my opinion. Instead of running through Sparta, blades in hand and killing everything that moves, Kratos slowly strolls through, at one point stopping to satisfy a few dozen women's sexual urges (Seriously, the sex mini-game in GOS tops all the others. No kidding). A brief flashback gives us a glimpse of a young Kratos and his brother, Deimos dueling just before they're forcefully separated at the hands of the then God of War, Ares. Soon after punishing a dissenter, we're given full control once more and allowed to mow down everything in Kratos' path.Once you've completed the game at least 1 time on Normal mode or above, you will have access to the true God of War fan's challenge, God Mode. God Mode is an incredibly difficult setting recommended only for advanced players. Starting a new game will also give you the option to choose from a selection of alternate attires for Kratos, each of which raise certain abilities' powers or reward you with more orbs after a kill. Treasures are back as well. This time we have Challenge Of The Gods, where you must complete 5-8 challenges that Ares and Athena task you with. They seem simple, but are anything but. In one challenge you have to open 6 chests while being attacked by several enemies. Opening a single chest with a few remaining enemies is hard enough, 6 is just sadistic. The Gauntlet, where you must kill every single enemy is bloody fun as well. The 2nd mode in Treasures is the Combat Arena. In the Combat Arena, YOU get to decide who you fight, where you fight and the level of difficulty. These modes are GOS' way of increasing replayability, but  I didn't really play them all that often. They're fun for a short while, but I'd much rather stick to the main game. The next mode is the Temple of Zeus. In this mode you can use the orbs you acquire in the main game to buy unlockables. In addition to all of that, you can also view all the in-game cinematics, a couple of videos about Deimos and a gallery.Cons:The biggest issue with Ghost of Sparta is the occasional off camera enemy who can strike at anytime without giving you any notice.Pros:New additions to the combat make it even more fun.Beautiful GraphicsGreat storyGod of War: Ghost of Sparta is a satisfying ride through the violent world of Greek Mythology, and one that no God of War fan should pass up just because it's a PSP title. Everything you love about Kratos is here, and in spades. At some points Ghost of Sparta even exceeds it's console elders. The final scene is easily one of the best, and one of the saddest in the entire franchise.\"", "Well im a veteran god of war fan.... And this addition is no different..... The story line will suck you in, the controls are still basic which is a plus for me..... The reason why im giving this a perfect score cause its a perfect game, just perfect, the graphics are the best ive ever seen on a handlheld, period.... The overall game is great, a def by for veteran god of was fans", "I never thought I'd say this, but after playing Ghost of Sparta for the last 5 hours and completing it, I can honestly say I think this is the best God of War title yet in the whole series! It might sound crazy to even think about comparing it on the same level as it's home console predecesors, but it really does stack up and here's why.Gameplay:The gameplay in the game was phenomenal in every way. The enemies were tough and relentless, and the finishing moves were brutal. The new Magic was actually useful, while in the other titles I rarely used them in battle. The extra weapons (or weapon in GoS' case) is fun to use as well as refreshingly original in feel. The boss fights felt titanic, yet flowed well and offered very satisfying climaxes. Overall the gameplay was fluid and smooth, with no rough patches or annoyances to speak of.Graphics:Let's be honest, it's the PSP, there's only so much it can do. But for all it's limitations, Ready At Dawn has made good use of the PSP's graphics processor and must have done all they could to exhaust the framerate. It looks amazing for a PSP title, but it can in no way compare to it's PS3 brethren. That said, GoS is still sure to please with it's mix of scenic landscapes and brutal up-close finishing moves.Story:Now here's where this game truly shines. I've played a lot of PSP games and so far none of them have had any memorable storylines, until now. The story in GoS can only be described as cinematic. It plays and feels like you're watching a movie. A good movie with great acting and interesting characters. I tend to play games for short sustained periods of time, usually cause I lose interest in about an hour. But GoS compelled me to continue playing to see how Kratos' story would unfold. Without a doubt, GoS has the best storyline of any GoW game or any game in general I've played since Uncharted 2, and that's saying something.I enjoyed this game immensely, but the thing I loved the most when I finally finished it, was the fact that it showed that a good developer can make create an impacting gaming experience on any system, despite technical limitations. So there's no excuse for developers to make shoddy games just because they're on the Wii or the DS or the PSP. This game shows that a truly talented game designer can create an awe inspiring game on any platform. So here's to you Ready At Dawn, great job and keep up the good work!", "After playing Chains of Olympus and God of War 3 for the PS3 I found little value in playing this. It's the same hack and slash experience as before. I didn't notice any improvement in graphics but they were at least as good as in the previous game.", "Psp at its greatest . This game is amazing plays like the Ps2 god of war and looks just as good as Ps2 graphics . amazing Psp graphics and controllers are also great . Decent story that flows with the series . If you want it on the go this is a must but you can also get the HD version if your looking to play it on the console for PS3 .", "\"Honestly, I am not sure how to review this game. I'd like to review it upon its own merit, but its a prequel, so comparisons to the other games in the series (most notably Chains of Olympus) are inevitable. We are all PSP owners who most likely have played every game in the excellent series. I scoured the internet and looked up every written review of this game known to man as I desperately waited for my preordered copy to arrive. I was VERY surprised to see that some websites gave this game a 7 out of ten, and I dismissed these sites as the ones who just said \"\"its the same blades again.\"\" After finishing the game a mere 4 hours ago, I'll tell you why those scores are justified.To begin, the environments in this game suffer from the same problems as God of War 3 and Killzone 2. They are dull, grey, and dark for the most part. I played through the game just hoping, just waiting for a new environment to dazzle me, but it never really happened. Rocky cliffsides, deserted temples, and firey hell (hades has made an appearance in every game) are everything the environment has to offer. While I don't mind the dullness, its the cramped feel of the entire game that bothers me. I felt like instead of playing through different environments, I was playing from path to path. The problem is, this game was directed by a former lead level designer. I'd expect the level design to be the highlight of the game, but its one of the main problems. The game feels small, cramped and lifeless. There is no \"\"building in the distance you'll get to later.\"\" Its a myraid of pathways.As for the magic abilities and weapons, sadly I didn't like any of the new additions. Some if it has to do with the fact that you must press the d-pad to initiate an attack, which may be hard for a split second decision. All of the abilities seem underpowered and lack creativity. I found myself NEVER using magic. I was left with the blades. The same good old blades.....the same blades. In addition, you get a spear and shield combination, which is actually kinda cool. You can block while moving like a true Spartan warrior and throw your spear. Its fun to use against one or two enemies, but against 5 or 6, the blades are much more reliable. One again, I found myself never using the ability unless I was forced to throw my spear at an unreachable enemy or obstruction. The shield was only used in 2 instances against the natural environment. Long story short, this game has the worst magic abilities of any God of War, and the spear was used about as much by me as the spear in God of War 2 was. Almost never.Reguarding the enemies and boss battles, there was some creativity. A new ability giving you the power to ignite your blades is essential against some enemies and obstacles, thus offering a new level of strategy to the fight. Boss battles are few and far between. Of the few, the final battle is the most memorable (obviously), but mainly by default. The final 20 mins of the game are great, and since I was only at the 6 hour mark (10 hours were promised) I was beginning to feel like the story, as well as Kratos' emotions were about to show something completely new, but it all ended 15 minutes later. I won't spoil it, but the final battle brings something new to the series we have never seen, although it was oddly executed. If you know the original, intended ending to God of War 3 (Stig's ending).....then you get the idea. The battle itself was underwhelming as a FINAL battle, but the emotional changes Kratos revealed overshadowed it completely. The other boss battles were completely forgettable.While the series' story is no Metal Gear Solid, Kratos is an angry man on a quest to find his brother. After finding out why he is so angry, you see why he's so angry. Chains of Olympus really helped with that more than the console versions. This game, although it has been renowned for its great story in the reviews, is not much different from the console versions. Its simple and to the point. The bad thing about Ghost of Sparta is that there is little motivation to continue onward, besides knowing that Deimos is still alive. The story is almost too concise and to the point like God of War 2, but as opposed to God of War 2, there aren't tons of environments, boss fights, and cool abilities and magic to discover.The God of War series is absolutely legendary in the gaming world. Its practically synonymous with the Sony PlayStation as a company and is the leader of its genre. This title is a lukewarm effort by Ready At Dawn in my opinion, given their impressive track record. I finished the game in 6 hrs, 20 mins; roughly the same play time as Chains of Olympus for me. Part of me believes that this game was made to fill in a few quick plot holes before ending the series, and another part of me feels like its a final effort to revive the dying PSP. I have no doubt in my mind when I say that this is THE WORST in the series. Chains of Olympus is superior in almost EVERY conceivable way. Ru Weerasuriya should have remained the director after his flawless work on Chains of Olympus.This game is to God of War what Portable Ops was to Metal Gear Solid.I will not just drop 3 stars and leave. I want to be as honest and as helpful as possible. Yes, I see that the 5 other reviewers have 100% helpful reviews and realize that I'm sacrificing my 90% helpful score by going against the norm. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about the game. ANYTHING. Thank you for reading with an open mind and hearing me out.PSN: I-Am-theIRONMANUPDATE NOVEMBER 20th, 2010I finished the game in 3 days, 2 weeks ago. All the challenges, unlocked the vids, costume, EVERYTHING. There are NO incentives to playing the challenges or playing on a harder difficulty because you win nothing for either. If you are a fan like me, you'll play them for the entertainment. Unfortunately, the challenges are so easy its insulting. No need to look at youtube walkthroughs this time around lol, but WARNING: for some reason, whatever setting you have the difficulty on in the combat arena, it will be the difficulty of the challenges. Set combat arena to normal if you wanna breeze through them. The only difficult challenge is the one where you can't get hit once. Those spider things spray green goo at you and kill you instantly!Another disappointment is the lack of any type of Making of featurette. As a matter of fact, there is no videos of Ready At Dawn at all. The game directors live (with preorder) more than makes up for it though. Also, the videos that you purchase with the orbs in the temple of Zeus add NOTHING to the game. In fact, 2 of the 3 reiterate things that were already in the story! In short, those extra videos sucked.For the cheaters, if you want to get a million orbs in 15 minutes, go to the combat arena, select infinite magic and life, and choose 2 minotaurs and a cyclops to fight. Set their attack to off, and MAKE SURE YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE INFINITE LIFE AS WELL. When you get to the arena spam the attack you get from Thanatos' daughter. In 15 mins, if you continually hit the left directional button, you'll have a million orbs.\"", "The gameplay is what you would expect from any GoW game, which is a good thing in my book.The thing that won me over was the storyline.  Unlike GoW 2 and 3, Kratos is a likeable character in this game.  You really feel for him as he confronts his mother and searches for his long lost brother.  This game fills in all the gaps of GoW 2 and 3 and explains why he wants vengeance so badly.This is also easily the best looking game that has ever been on the PSP.  They are even better than the PS2 games.If you own a PSP and are a God of War fan, this is a no brainer and easily one of the best PSP games you can buy.", "I just got around to finishing this and it was stunning. Amazing jaw dropping graphics, great gameplay and overall amazing way to send off the PSP.Repetitive is it's only draw back. Highly recommended.", "I was somewhat disappointed by God of War 3.. but this my PSP game my friend is THE BEST!!!! So many scenes in the game had me going OHHHHHH !!!!!!!! GOOD stuff !! A+ !!!!! you won't regret this purchase.  I play it on the TV and maaaaaaan !!!", "First reason to buy a PSP wasGod of War Chains of Olympus. the second reason is this game. absolutely amazing and fun. picked it up for $20 here on amazon, beat it in 6 hours on easy...totally worth it. you pay $10 for a 2hr movie, so $20-$30 bucks for a 6hr game is totally worth it. awesome, true to franchise story, great game play. I loved every second of it. BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A PSP!", "It's incredible that they were able to fit an entire GOW game onto the PSP.  The story, music, sound, and gameplay are all top notch.  They fit the control scheme perfectly to the PSP.  The graphics match the PS2 GOW games.  This is definitely the best game I have played on the PSP so far.", "\"Well I pre-ordered this with the entertainment pack but I foolishly wrote a review for the entertainment pack before I finished the game, now I've finished the game and I don't want to rewrite my other review to include this bit about the game so I figure I'll just type one up on the games page it's self since I think that would be more helpful.This is the story of why Kratos went so ballistic between the games God of War and God of War 2 and caused Zeus to want to take him down a peg, however they don't actually get into that part, you play as a still very mortal Kratos with his regular, \"\"grr I'm so angry about something\"\" attitude and blades of Athena that he receives at the end of God of War. The story takes it's self a while to really get going and explain to you exactly what and why you're doing it but there's plenty of action and gameplay to keep you interested until the story starts to unfold.The graphics and gameplay in Ghost of Sparta just puts Chains of Olympus to shame in every way shape and form, this really is a beautiful little game that borrows a lot of mechanics and elements from GOW3 as opposed to the game it directly follows, GOW. I liked how they focused on the Blades as a primary weapon and only give you the secondary weapon, The Arms of Sparta, which consists of a Spartan shield and spear very similar to what you would see in the film \"\"300,\"\" but it doesn't replace the Blades and make you not want to use them but The Arms of Sparta offer a different style of play a more defensively minded offensive strategy but I felt that style slowed down the action too much and I just stuck to the Blades of Athena mostly. I can not tell you how much I miss the Icarus Wings in this game, I've gotten so used to them that Kratos just really feels like he's missing something in the games without them, but that's really just a pet peeve, I realize due to the constraints of the story they couldn't be included but something similar would have been nice. Borrowed from GOW3 are elements such as reusable locales, interaction in-game with huge NPC's (that's Non-Playable Character for anyone not in the know), an ability that is finite in use but infinitely reusable, like the bottom meter in GOW3 for the bow and other special items but in this game it just adds a fire element to the Blades and causes burn and explosive damage, takes a few secs to recharge but then he's all ready to slice and burn all over again. The magic attacks were hit and miss they had one REALLY useless magic and one REALLY useful one and the extra was just, well \"\"extra.\"\" The game it's self isn't very long I believe my final save was at 6 hours and 30 minutes but since they have the battle arena mode and challenges of the Gods it makes the makes the game really playable even after finishing the story mode and all the red orbs you collect can be used towards special rewards in yet another bonus section of the game called the Temple of Zeus.As for the story here's where I think the game suffers the most and I'll tell you why I think that.I like what all five directors involved with the GOW franchise so far have done to reinvent the super hero, because lets face facts Kratos is a superhero. We don't know much about him other then that when he shows up big things are going to happen and I think the game diminished that a bit by trying to make him a bit more human and forcing us to go along on the journey of self discovery and personal revelation with him. It doesn't really add anything to the characters ultimate pathos or shed any new light on him. Yes there's a few quickie, \"\"oh yeah this is where he got the scar on his eye,\"\" moments but other wise it just doesn't really say anything. Yes in the final moments of the game it explains why Kratos was so blood drunk at the beginning of GOW2 but other wise the story it's self is a throw away in the whole mythos of God of War. The addition of Kratos' brother Deimos into GOW lore was somewhat refreshing although it was kinda upsetting to see Deimos, a guy whose been in captivity since he was a small boy somehow over power and pummel Kratos similar to what Kratos did to Hercules in GOW3. I wish we could have gotten to know Deimos a bit better and I won't post any spoilers but you really only see him for the last 15 minutes of a six hour game, everything else is a flashback of when he and Kratos were children. That's another thing, I never needed to see Kratos as a skinny little boy it ruined a bit of the mystique about the character but I understand some people or maybe most people, are interested in where their heroes came from, I'm not.The stories to GOW have always been simple and straightforward with Kratos wanting to achieve a goal and then doing that and while this story eventually comes to that point it starts off very meandering and is probably the most wandering story in the entire franchise, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. One of my other favorite game franchises is the Metal Gear franchise and anyone familiar with that series knows exactly how contrived and juxtaposed a still captivating story can be. I just think such story telling techniques have no place in the GOW series.But anyways, if you're looking for bar-none one the best action platforming games available for your PSP this is the one.\""], "Gamma": [0.12980978190898895, 0.11718548834323883, 0.12805554270744324, 0.12526915967464447, 0.1250177025794983, 0.11882458627223969, 0.12687253952026367, 0.12896527349948883], "Beta": [[0.1431361436843872, 0.04004618898034096, 0.00649608438834548, 0.001914266380481422, 0.1254420280456543, 0.160140261054039, 0.0020133547950536013, 0.27187395095825195, 0.08030066639184952, 0.16139726340770721, 0.002189348917454481, 0.0050504449754953384], [0.13784438371658325, 0.050427235662937164, 0.011064399965107441, 0.004180049058049917, 0.12366999685764313, 0.17346692085266113, 0.004651025403290987, 0.23828504979610443, 0.08566717058420181, 0.15567442774772644, 0.005107346456497908, 0.009962065145373344], [0.14279599487781525, 0.04058697819709778, 0.006591533310711384, 0.0019229163881391287, 0.12522836029529572, 0.16100142896175385, 0.0020860780496150255, 0.2708950340747833, 0.08029630780220032, 0.16111941635608673, 0.002264276146888733, 0.005211731418967247], [0.14211414754390717, 0.04219241812825203, 0.007217113859951496, 0.002201416529715061, 0.1251208633184433, 0.1633131504058838, 0.0023988476023077965, 0.26531535387039185, 0.08130400627851486, 0.1603773832321167, 0.002609027549624443, 0.0058362470008432865], [0.14204171299934387, 0.042362529784440994, 0.007285921834409237, 0.002232576720416546, 0.1251075714826584, 0.16354386508464813, 0.0024334334302693605, 0.26473596692085266, 0.0814080685377121, 0.1602972000837326, 0.0026470439042896032, 0.0059041669592261314], [0.13937939703464508, 0.04778538644313812, 0.009702259674668312, 0.0034289706964045763, 0.12431494891643524, 0.17045611143112183, 0.0037911615800112486, 0.2467680722475052, 0.08441533893346786, 0.15735900402069092, 0.004150756169110537, 0.008448637090623379], [0.1425451934337616, 0.04111456871032715, 0.006803710013628006, 0.0020214354153722525, 0.1251903921365738, 0.1619102656841278, 0.0021988453809171915, 0.2688899338245392, 0.08064663410186768, 0.16085928678512573, 0.002388224471360445, 0.005431524012237787], [0.14298932254314423, 0.04010931774973869, 0.006412397138774395, 0.001845595077611506, 0.12524893879890442, 0.16029465198516846, 0.0019995139446109533, 0.27258041501045227, 0.07998619228601456, 0.16132885217666626, 0.002168974606320262, 0.005035778973251581]]}
