I can still type on the chat pad but I can't use the microphone through it.  When I plug the microphone directly into my controller it works about 10% of the time.  This thing is a pile of dog crap and i'm sick of buying CRAP!*12/26/2010*I received a replacement from amazon.  Effortless process as usual.  Thanks Amazon.  Now onto the product.  The headphones that come with this product is absolutely worthless.  Once I received my replacement, my mic stopped working properly after 1 week.  It is absolutely JUNK.  Chatpad works fine.", "OK, we all know how incredibly annoying it is to input any alpha-numeric character with just a standard controller (that's why you're reading this, right?). Here are my thoughts on the chatpad:PROS- It saves a lot of time when entering codes or sending messages.- Overall feedback is perfect. The physical and audible clicks feel just right.- It snaps right into the controller and does not need a separate power source.- The keys are backlit (only activated when typing) so you can use it in the dark.- It comes with a wired headset. Don't we all already have one of these that we're not using?- Has a headset jack so you can still plug one in (it covers the controller's jack).- It does not impact chargers that charge from top of the controller. Works fine with what I have,Xbox 360 Energizer Power & Play Charging System.CONS- If you have really big hands and like to wrap your fingers around the entire controller handles, you won't be able to anymore.- This adds a little bit of weight to the controller.- It drains the battery quicker; though nothing too noticeable for me since I don't message much.- It blocks chargers that charge from the bottom of the controller.OVERALL- Personally, I think this chatpad is worth the investment if you can afford it (or if you send a lot of messages). That said, at the cost of about $25, if I was a starving college kid like I was eons ago, I would probably suffer without it.", "I would like to mention two points I have not seen addressed in the review of this product from my Amazon peers.1. While gaming, the added chatpad not only adds extra weight to the controller, but if you have bigger hands like me, actually cramps up game play.  This is most noticeable in using the right thumb stick, particularly in movement that requires the thumbstick positioned directly to the left.  In this game play configuration, my thumb actually hits against the frame of the chatpad.  While this does not impede movement or game play significantly, it does not feel comfortable.  It detracted my experience enough that I only attach the chatpad when typing, which I am finding is actually less and less thanks to most of the voice activated features on the Xbox.2. Regarding the standard Xbox headset: while the chatpad does act as a pass-through for voice (there is a headset jack on the bottom of the chatpad), the microphone jack is sloppy and does provide a feedback static if bumped due to a poor connection.  This may be a defect on the unit I received, but when playing games, I find the chatpad actually decreases audio quality (both transmit and receive) and I end up having to disconnect it anyway.I write this because while the simple and obvious workaround is to disconnect the chatpad when not using it, the connection is less than simple to connect (requires a bit of force) and becomes a burden.", "typing with a controller is a pain so in that sense the chatpad is a improvement that makes it acceptably worth using even with the heft and clunkiness it adds.", "This is a perfect gift item for those who need a Chat/text pad for X360 controllers.  The Headset also makes a great backup if you have a wireless rechargeable one.  The items separately go for a total of $50.", "This chatpad works great! It's a good solution for texting quickly when chatting in facebook or menssenger and also to write Tuits! It's really usefull when playing, make so easy to keep a conversation without any interference with the game. Every gamer should have one!", "\"I have had my Xbox 360 for a couple years, but I never had invested in a chatpad. The live voice chat, I thought, made typing messages fairly rare.  But as I played more online co-op and versus games, the occasions come up when you want to thank another player for playing honorably, or finishing the campaign despite the late hour, or whatever. Picking letters using the joystick and screen is a fairly laborious process, so I bought the chatpad.At first, I thought it didn't work.  I had attached it to the controller, but the chatpad did not seem to work.  Make sure it \"\"Clicks\"\" on both sides of your controller.  The fit is very snug, and I do not think it was intended to come on and off regularly.  Once the chatpad was snapped into place properly, it worked brilliantly.The chatpad is a great add-on for your controller:1) the chatpad has an access point for the standard xbox 360 wired headset.2) the chatpad is very light and does not in any way interfere with the controller.3) the chatpad letters/numbers are backlit when you start typing.4) the chatpad works fine with theXbox 360 Black Play & Charge Kitand also works withXbox 360 Energizer Power and Play Charging System - Black. You do not have to remove the chatpad to charge your controller. NOTE: CHATPAD WILL HAVE TO BE REMOVED TO CHARGE YOUR CONTROLLER WITHXbox 360 Charge Base - Black5) the chatpad is compact with green shift and red shift which allows each key to function as 2 additional signs or symbols (great for creating names for aliens, elves, or other characters)I frequently use the chatpad eventhough I didn't think I would.  Generally speaking the chatpad is most useful for:1) leaving players a quick \"\"thank you\"\"2) entering the MS points redemption codes3) creating your bio/profile4) easily creating custom character names in various games.The xbox 360 chatpad is a surprisingly useful add-on.  I can't believe I used the xbox for so long without one. I can whole-heartedly recommend the chatpad to most xbox users and all xbox players who play online.\"", "The headset is the typical one you've probably seen before. The keyboard is the real gem here. It just feels great. The tactile click of the keys, the back-light, and the way it fits the controller so well make it a great purchase."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.09916805475950241, 0.09714861959218979, 0.17454689741134644, 0.06459593772888184, 0.13084638118743896, 0.036346934735774994, 0.13956651091575623, 0.136714369058609, 0.12106630206108093]]}
