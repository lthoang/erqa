In addition to Internet radio, it can access content on media servers, as well as content on an attached USB flash drive. It also supports a variety of encoding formats incl. MP3, WMA, and OGG.Setup was fairly straightforward - it detected available networks, and prompted for a passphrase. It then proceeded to process a firmware update without incident.What works well:############1/ Can handle a multitude of sources - Internet radio, network shares, USB drives, etc.2/ Supports wifi 802.11g as well as wired connections.3/ Decent output options - SPDIF, coax, analog RCA plugs, and headphone jack4/ Easy to setup and use5/ Aesthetically pleasing with nice clean lines6/ Presets can be stored into the remote's buttonsWhat doesn't work well:################1/ The LCD is the only user interface, which allows it to work as an independent unit. However, I found myself constantly wishing for a larger display.2/ Its user interface was very non intuitive and had a definite learning curve for me.All in all, once I had it configured just right with all my presets loaded, the annoyances became less important and I was able to enjoy its delivered audio without distraction.Happy Listening!", "Confession- we moved into our house about four years ago and we *still* haven't set up our stereo. Our computers, iPhones, and iPods have sort of made music very portable, so we didn't really feel a huge need for any sort of stereo/radio in our living room.However, a few months ago I started listening to Pandora radio on my iPhone and got hooked. For those who haven't tried it yet, it's basically a custom internet radio- you type in the name of bands, musicians, genres of music and Pandora creates a personal radio station for you based on your musical interests. They also have several stations programmed that you can choose from if you just want to pick a genre of music and go from there. It's better than satellite because not only is it customized to your tastes, but it's absolutely free (commercials are minimal- just a small spot every ten or fifteen songs.) I tried to figure out a way to get Pandora into the living room, on a *bigger* scale, but came up with nothing.Then the Grace Digital Tuner came along and it's the *perfect* solution.Even though we have no official &#34;stereo&#34; equipment, we simply plugged the tuner into out 40&#34; flat screen and instant home stereo! The tuner is very low profile and slid right over our TiVo. It's very attractive and lightweight.We're not big &#34;stereo/entertainment system&#34; people, but this tuner has us a bit giddy. I love how easy it is to use and how easy it was to access *my* Pandora settings (saved on the Pandora website and accessed wirelessly by the tuner) and get my personalized stations playing through the Tuner.The first thing we did after we unpacked it was plug it in to the wall and the TV (the tuner does come with a remote, a power cord and antenna, but you need to provide your own cords), and turned it on (power switch in back). Immediately it recognized our WiFi and presented us with a list of wireless networks. Entering a password was a little tedious, but once you get it in there, it remembers it.The tuner got online, updated both the firmware and software automatically. To access Pandora, we went into the &#34;settings&#34; of the Tuner, and the tuner registered itself over the internet, and displayed a code on the LCD display on the front of the unit. We went to the Grace website, set up an account, entered the code, and we were able to access our Pandora settings.We haven't tried setting up our satellite radio account with it yet, but with Pandora, I'm not sure we will even bother. We were able to access several internet radio stations and FM radio stations as well.The unit came with a power cord and antenna, but we needed a digital/audio cable or RCA audio cables to hook it up to our TV.Final word of recommendation:GET THE IPHONE APP FOR THE TUNER! It is available free from the iPhone app store (doesn't seem to work on the iPad though...). The app basically turns your iPhone into an advanced remote control for the tuner - scans the network for any receivers and recognizes them and lets you control several aspects of the tuner from your phone, including volume, station tuning, etc.. It pulls up information for the music playing, as well. However, you can't turn the unit on from the iPhone- when the tuner isn't on, it's not active on the network. Not sure if this would be the case if the tuner were plugged into our network.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a simple way to bring radio (internet, satellite, or otherwise) into their homes.", "I have the prior model to this one (4200?). Very similar features, just not as sleek but certainly the same awful, archaic interface....... UNLESS!!!!! one uses their Apple friendly Grace app on your iPhone/pad/pod!  Now life is good. The Grace app lets me do all the general daily functions with ease. Has been very stable over the last year or so I've had it on iPod and iPad. Probably have an Android one out there, too. Just sayin', there's a great workaround the lousy interface if you can use their app. Otherwise, great product. I'll be buying this model by years end.......guaranteed!", "\"The \"\"Grace Digital Wireless Hi-fi Internet Radio Tuner\"\" is one of the best tuners that I have ever seen.  The ease of setup and the multiple choices that you have for your listening pleasure (Internet Radio, Pandora, Live365, and others) was honestly quite astonishing to me.  With the WiFi I have in my house, I had 5 bars on everything and the radio comes in crystal clear.  And the channels!  There were so many of them that I had trouble selecting JUST one.  It also has a nice bright display that includes a clock (as well as an Alarm setting) and a headphone jack. As far as setup goes, it was as basic as plugging in power and then piping it into an output device (I used my old stereo since its already hooked into the speakers).  It's actually a quite attractive system (I guess I like the blue LED display), it is light (maybe too light when you are pushing the buttons on the front) and the profile is quite low - about as tall as your typical high end blu-ray player.However there is a BIG \"\"but\"\".  The User interface system that Grace uses is archaic.  It's been awhile, and I'm dating myself here, but I felt like I was programming the clock on my hi-fi that I got in 1980 (that still had an 8-track player in it BTW).  All the initial setup uses the Tuner's knob and the frame refresh rate makes the display constantly flash if you scroll faster than say 1 or 2 channels a second.  The display only shows a few stations/songs at a time and there is no way to fast forward or go back beyond the simply pushing the forward and back buttons over and over and over again - so you basically have none of the time-saving buttons that we have all come accustomed to in your basic $25 stereo or any car radio built in the last 10 years.  And just wait until you want to queue up more than 2 or 3 songs at a time - I think it took me about 2 or 3 minutes to setup music that then only played for maybe 10 min - a huge waste of time - because when you pick a song (or a radio station), the unit goes back to the top of the list for your next selection and NOT to the place where you last selected.  So like if I chose a station called \"\"Klassic Kristian\"\" music, scrolling all the way down from \"\"AAA AM\"\" (and going from A to K on the radio takes a LONG TIME), the next time I want to pick a station (mind you w/o turning the tuner off) it is back up at the top at \"\"AAA AM\"\".  As you can probably assertain for yourself, I have never gotten out of the \"\"A's\"\" on the internet radio because 1) there are so many stations and 2) it takes so long to scroll down.  Which means that I basically use about 10% of it's capability - a huge waste of this unit's vaste potential.  After you do the initial setup, there is no interface with the front of the unit - everything is on the remote - so God forbid if you lose that sucker.So the Pandora and internet radio are really, honestly God sends and this unit plays them with crystal clarity.  I really love the look of it and there is a vast potential that I have yet to even tap.  However, the interface system is so awful that I rarely bother.  I've had it setup in my house for 4 months and I think I've only used it half a dozen times and my kids don't even try - it just takes way too much time.  What a crying shame...********* UPDATE ***********You can download an Apple/Android app that allows your I-Pod/smartphone to act as an advanced remote.  Although I have not tried it, I got rid of the radio in frustration about 5 months after I got it, this would be a huge benefit!  Grace has obviously worked very hard to please their customers - read comments below.  I now wish I still had mine....  :-(\"", "Actually, this is the only digital radio I even own, and I don't think I'll need another one.  This tuner is super sweet.  However, it is a TUNER, and does not come with any internal speakers.  You will need to supply your own.It connects fast to my wireless network, and can even be plugged in via ethernet.  I had no problems connecting ever, and havent had any buffering problems, yet.You get a ton of stations along with Pandora, and Sirius XM (subscription needed).  You can also stream music from your computer, and via USB stick.  The display is basic, and the knob acts as a controller.  You select stations and options with it, and push the knob in to enter. There is a controller included, and I suggest using that to program stuff.  If you have an iPhone, download the Grace app for free and use that to save preset stations.  It is a lot easier using the iPhone to pick your stations.  The iPhone app will shut off the tuner, but will not turn it on.I currently have this connected to a Denon Soundbar, and the sound quality is excellent.  I give this a 5 star rating, and see no fault with the design or use based on it's price and features.I highly recommend this!", "First, let me say that I own a Logitech Squeezebox Touch, which has been discontinued.  I needed another source for internet music for another part of the house, so I bought the Grace tuner.  What a difference in the two devices.  The Grace tuner is slow to respond, lost wireless connectivity regularly, and has a scrolling readout that is practically useless.  I decided to do without internet radio in this room and use my smart TV to access Spotify and Pandora.  I get full information, including cover art, on the TV screen for whatever is playing.This went back to Amazon, whose return policy was fairly painless, as usual.", "I had never heard of Grace Digital Audio before I purchased this tuner.  There are not a lot of options if you are looking for a traditional component size internet digital tuner.  I was a little apprehensive but was swayed by the reviews here.  While the build quality is not up to the major manufacturers like Yamaha or Denon neither is the price.  I was looking for an internet radio tuner that fit into my home theater rack.  (I have shipped the tuner to Middle Atlantic for measurement and they now have it in their rack shelf database.)  This unit does everything I was looking for and much more.  The iPhone/iPod app is very well thought out and adds incredible value to owning this tuner.  So far the performance is phenomenal and I am listening to music and talk radio from all around the world.  Also having access to my digital library, Pandora and Live365 makes this my go to choice for our whole house audio system.  I can't praise the functionality of the GDI-IRDT200 highly enough.", "Wow!  What a sweet device this is for the even the not so techo-inclined.  Installation was a breeze as there were only 2 cables to hook-up: power, and RCA jacks.  I piped it into my receiver and hit the power button and bingo! it found my network over it's installed handy dandy wireless network adapter (G).  It prompted me for my password, which I entered (by turning the knob, which was kind of a pain) and it connected no problem.  You can also wire your connection through the network cable slot in the back, however, no network cable was included.After that, I chose internet radio and I had choices galore.  The real beauty of this device is how you can personalize it.  Got a Pandora account?  Pipe it through this baby with ease.  How about Live365?  You can do that too.  Want to search the internet radio via genre? No sweat.  Absolutely amazing I tell you.I created my Grace account, added stations online and podcasts and after unplugging the device and plugging back in (yah, they tell you to do that so it updates the streams), my customization was found on the device and away I went.Here is the absolute frosting on the cake...I'm now streaming all of my music from my laptop and external hard drive to this device!  Sort by genre, album, album artist, create a queue, you name it, this thing can do it.  This kills the Windows Media Center that never worked right with my 360.Who knew you could have so much fun with a radio??", "\"I recently assembled a sort of \"\"old skool\"\" stereo system: 2-channel integrated amp, CD player, nice but not too nice bookshelf speakers, and this doohickey.Prior to getting this I was playing my music collection through a portable flash player and through my phone. Both of those work and sound fine, but having your phone plugged into your stereo is pretty inconvenient. The portable flash player was better, but it could not stream Pandora or internet radio. I think if I had a TV hooked up near this stereo, I might have used a Roku instead, but since I want this stereo nice and simple (reliving my youth) I prefer this kind of device.It works fine and sounds great. The UI, as others have pointed out is atrocious. I'll also say that the user's guide is pretty bad, too. It looks like a very small company produces this unit, but you can tell that there are some serious enthusiasts there. The UI is somewhat made up for by the fact that you can control the device through an Android or iPhone app running on your phone or tablet. That UI is not great, either, but much better. And it's very natural to be using a tablet and then quickly switch apps to skip to the next song, etc.UPDATE 2/24/12After a week or so, this unit stopped connecting to my wireless network. It could see it, but just wouldn't connect. As an experiment I kept moving it closer and closer to my router. It would connect when it was about three feet away, but not further. I tried a factory reset and some other stuff, but it never worked again. I returned it for a new unit. The new one works so far.\"", "The Good:*Large variety of content from all around the globe for FREE(just pay for the box)*Surprisingly very durable for the box of such magnitude*Looks great:  blue LCD display and doesn't attract fingerprints like other devicesThe Bad:*Very bulky for today's world (about 16x10x2 inches dimensions and about 10 lbs in weight)*Difficult to setup in comparison to other similar devices*Some stations have a bad qualityThe Bottom Line:Grace Digital is a solid choice for the Internet radio if you don't mind putting up with the above quirks.  It looks nice if you put it under your TV because good luck putting this huge box elsewhere.  You will find yourself choosing some stations over others based on quality, which can be frustrating.  However if you can put up with that and don't mind paying a one-time cost for life(pay it and forget it) then this is the choice for you.  If space is an issue for you, you may look elsewhere.", "It is a very strong performer with lot of features. The team that came up the specs did a wonderful job. Tonnes and tonnes of features. WIFI, Radio, Alarm clock, DLNA music client, Windows network share, headphone output, digital SPDIF and Optical output etc etc. I can't find any thing lacking in terms of connectivity or features. Once I plugged and connected every thing it worked flawless, I didnt hear any noise or jitter. Played well with tough AKG headphones, digital output quality was fantastic. I didnt hear any difference between Audio CD and DLNA streamed media. I use a Bel canto DAC3 as external DAC. Features wise it is top notch. I dont think any one who buys this will miss any thing.  It found almost all the radio stations, lot of variety. It has support for high bit rate audio via digital output, in built DAC can only support 16 bit audio.Now comes the cons. All of them are related to the User Interface, Remotecontrol and LCD screen. The LCD screen is a pre-historic 4 frames/sec refresh screen. If you scroll faster it blinks and is hard to read. The menu system has lot of issues. Every time you hit return it goes back to the start the list. Let's say you have 1000 songs in your folder, you want to play the 500 and 501th song. In IPod you go scroll down choose the 500th song once it is over, you can just go down and choose the 501th song. Here it goes back to 1st, then you have to scroll down again to choose 501th. It get annoying when you want to put more than 10 songs in the queue. You have to scroll down 10 times.  The remote control is useless, all the initial configuration like WPA key etc has to be done via the knob. You can't do the initial configuration like setting up WPA via remote control, you have to use the dial and there is no easy way to do DEL or BACKSPACE. Every thing from setting time to WPA key has to be done via the front panel buttons and knobs. There is another annoying bug with media streaming, it skips the first 10 seconds.There is no pause, next, prev buttons on the front panel. You need to use the remote for that. For scrolling down(which you will do a lot). If not for the user interface annoyance, it will be a 5 start product. Unable to measure jitter as my sound card input didnt work, from what I could hear I sounded flawless. Iam not expecting great things from the inbuilt DAC, it is probably as good as cheap laptop DACs. Use a external DAC or your pre-amp DAC to get the best sound.I replaced the default wireless duck with a larger 5db antenna, it improved the range a lot. Now I see 5 bars all across on the other side of the house. It is a very strong performer, if you are willing to forgive some of the user interface annoyances.", "The product works well and looks nice.  Appearance may sound trivial, but I wanted something that blended well with my other high-end stereo equipment since it sits in the my living room.  This product blends in nicely.  It interfaced with my wifi easily (netgear) and I was able to transfer my Sirius/XM account with just a phone call to the company.  I had a Sirius box, but one it was unsightly and two it struggled to get the satellite feed in my house.  Streaming wireless works much better.  I have experienced two cons with this device.  First, like many reviewers have noted, the user interface is not very friendly.  You have to scroll through long menus and it all seems very 1990's.  I also find the organization counterintuitive and hard to navigate.  Secondly, the system loses my wifi periodically.  The signal is strong and I have a signal booster inches from this device.  I have lots of wifi devices and some home automation and this is the only device that loses the signal.I find myself using this mostly for Sirius and Internet radio.  I do not stream my music through it because it is still easier to connect my iPod to my receiver.  I have a lot of music and its much easier and quick to use the interface on my iPod to find particular songs.  I have given it four stars.  The clumsy interface is a detraction and probably should be upgraded in future models.  Recommended with some reservation.", "\"The Grace Digital Radio Tuner delivers on everything it promises. The casing and the LCD display are attractive and inconspicuous, making them blend into your existing home theater nicely. It is a great appliance for integrating your Pandora account into your home theater system, and it offers a vast variety of internet station listings that blow traditional FM radio away.However, while this device is fun and useful, it has several drawbacks.First is that the WiFi reception is weak and lacking in quality. Someone who values high-end home theater equipment is probably not going to be impressed with low bit rate audio coming out of their expensive speakers.The second drawback is that setting up the device to access your Pandora account is not very convenient and requires many steps and many references back to the instruction manual. Then, once it IS set up, the remote control for the device makes it extremely tedious to navigate through the menus and actually use Pandora. And while we're on the subject of the remote, it is not specific enough; it could use several more options and buttons to make it easier to access all of the features this device has to offer.Third, as this is obviously a device meant to access internet based-radio, you will have to deal with all the usual annoyances of internet radio. Enough said.Overall, i think it's a great appliance and i'm glad I have it, however it could use some fine tuning. Hopefully a \"\"2nd generation\"\" version will work all of these things out.\"", "This device is incredibly powerful.  Within 30 mins of having it out of the box, it was connected to our home wifi network, and I tracked down 4 radio stations I listen to when I drive through NY, Hartford and Boston respectively, and had them programmed into my stored stations.  Now I have them available streaming anytime.  Pretty cool.  It also connects to Pandora, which I'll make use of soon (that requires connecting via a web account on your PC.  And you can stream audio off of your pc as well via a shared directory with music files on your pc.So it is remarkably powerful for the price.  It can basically serve as the heart of a very flexible audio system in your home, as a single device.The interface is not all that easy to use though.  Basically you have a knob, a small display and a back button to try to browse through thousands of radio stations, for instance -- that's ineffective.  Once its set up with some stored favorites, you don't really have to go back to that, so the functionality after setup is good, and its very flexible.  But let's just say it isn't the UI that Apple would have put on it.  Other nits - trying to enter your wifi password with a knob is a bit of a pain.  Also, when I tried to connect the unit to my web account the website failed a couple times, but eventually got it.All of that said, for the price - impressive and functional!", "This Grace Digital wireless internet radio is truly an innovative device with some very good features and few drawbacks as well. Installation was fairly easy with a power cable and the RCA jacks. The receiver itself is light and nice looking. Once setup, it will ask you to create a Grace account and enter your password. I had no touble connecting to my wireless network with this. As for the stations, you have a lot of choices like Pandora, Sirius etc. The one thing I did not like about this is the user interface on this. The front panel could have been much better with more options to operate from it vs. the remote which can cause a lot of frustration at times. For now, it works very well as long as the internet connection is good, but for the price, it should have been near perfect.", "\"I was looking for a replacement for my Sirius \"\"Table Top\"\" radio which began having connection problems.  I needed something which had a line out jack.  I chose this radio after much shopping and comparing features of other Grace radios.  This model has an Ethernet jack in addition to wireless - a good feature to have if you have a flaky wireless network.Grace opened up a whole world of listening for me, rather than just listening to Sirius streaming.  So many stations and options.The good:Total time it took me to bring the box in from the car to listening to music: 30 minutes, without reading the manual.  That included removing my TTR1, hunting for an audio cable, entering my WEP password, entering my Sirius password, and entering my computer password to browse.  I have a Mac running Snow Leopard and Grace logged in without problems and was browsing my disk.  I registered the radio and added my free Pandora account.  It was playing for a while before I heard a commercial, so I upgraded my Pandora account to their paid service to never hear advertising again.The network settings allowed me to connect DHCP or modify the DNS, gateway, and IP address.  I tweaked the settings to set a static IP address on the network.  The audio seems better than the Sirius TTR1 as well.Digital optical output jack is available.The presets switch service as well as station.  I can easily switch between Sirius channel presets and Pandora presets.  The radio appears to keep playing the old station while it acquires the new one, decreasing dead air time.The bad:Bear in mind these are complicated beasts.  Performance relies on your Internet provider and the equipment you have installed.  I never expect every feature to work perfectly.My first gripe - no audio cable.  Yea, it's nice that they've included a digital output jack which I still don't have the equipment to use.  But, I needed to dig through my closet for a simple audio cable to hook it up.  If they could include batteries for the remote they could toss in a cheap set of RCA cables too.By default, the \"\"stay connected\"\" setting is on.  This doesn't work for me.  It works for a while, but overnight the radio cannot connect with this setting on.  I had to manually run through the settings every time until I turned it off.  The radio should be smart enough to re-connect if it looses its connection.  Meanwhile, I just tolerate the extra 5 seconds it takes to re-connect the wireless network, which is still much faster than the Sirius TTR1.The iPhone app is really bad for connecting to the radio, I'm guessing since I let the radio disconnect from the network and I'm using wireless.  It may be easier to control if I had it wired.  The iPhone app is essential for scrolling through all the local stations and browsing when you don't know what you're looking for... because,The interface.  ugg.  There is a backlight contrast setting, but unless I'm missing something not much in the way of controlling the brightness of the display or timeout.  I've just left it on default settings.The radio seems to designed for rack mounted systems, so it's much wider than it has to be.  There aren't enough buttons on the front panel.  I need a combination of the front panel, iPhone app, and the included remote to quickly access everything.Conclusion: I'm still rating it 5 stars despite its flaws because it does what I want it to do.  It plays music.  The audio sounds wonderful.  I have access to whole world of music with many options, such as browsing my Mac for music, using an SD card in the front panel jack, or acquiring signals off the air.I will be exploring with this radio for a long time.edit 2/24/2012 - opps.  After many hours of listening the radio couldn't find the wireless network.  The radio convinced itself that it was wired-only while I've never plugged a cable to the RJ45 jack.  A factory reset didn't resolve it.  I also needed to unplug it for a while, factory reset, then it found the network once but couldn't re-connect after a station update.  I was using a static IP over wireless.  I rebooted my router and set the radio for full DHCP on wireless-only.  Disabled the \"\"stay connected\"\" setting again.  Now it's working again.  I hope I don't have to do that too often.  Funny, but with a factory reset I did not have to re-enter my Sirius information - although I did register the radio.edit 3/16/2012 - opps again.  I had turned off the radio using the iPhone app remote.  Boy, that was a mistake.  When I turned it back on, it was able to log into the network but it would just sit and spin trying to connect to anything without timing out.  The solution was to unplug the radio for a minute.  Then it couldn't find the network and prompted me to use the existing WEP key or enter a new one.  I re-entered my key.  From there the radio worked just fine.I knocked my original 5-star review to 4-stars since Grace still does not report any firmware updates to address some of these connection problems.  Seems the thing to do when the radio gets \"\"weird\"\" is to unplug it for a minute.  Also, avoid using the iPhone app to power it off.  That caused bad things to happen.edit 3/26/2012 - I think we've hit bottom now.  After connecting for a week, the radio would display \"\"Internal Error 1074 690\"\" for about a minute, then restart.  I would try a \"\"Factory Reset\"\" and unplug it for a few minutes which might or might not get it connect.  At this point, I figure there's something unreasonably wrong with the radio and visited Grace Digital's website to ask for repair.  In the process of submitting a ticket I was offered a few choices to fix my problem before confirming the repair ticket.  One option is something called a \"\"Master Factory Reset.\"\"Master Factory Reset is apparently different than the Factory Reset which can be reached by navigating the menus.  The Master Factory Reset is accomplished by unplugging the radio, holding down the select button, then plugging the radio in while continuing to hold down the select button until a confirmation message is displayed.  This is quite tricky if you don't have long arms to reach both the plug and the select button at the same time.No problems connecting immediately following the reset.  And, I've noticed a few options which were really set to factory defaults when just the plain \"\"Factory Reset\"\" did not do it.  If it fails again I'm returning it.edit 4/8/2012 - Working perfectly.  It's been a struggle to have the radio work as designed.  Here are a few tips.  This radio prefers wired over wireless connection.  Do not download updated firmware if it's not broke.  Disable the \"\"Stay Connected\"\" setting in the network settings; those 20 seconds it will save you powering up will cost you a lot more time trying to re-connect when it fails.  Use the presets to save your favorite channels, which changes the source as well as the station.  That way you can easily switch between Pandora and Sirius with a single button press rather than a frustrating game of \"\"What button do I have to press now?\"\"edit 9/16/2012 - Wireless connection is useless.  Grace, if you're listening, fire the engineer who wrote your firmware because they know not what they do.  I needed to do a power-off, factory reset two more times, re-enter the WEP password, only to have it fail in just a few days.  As a hack, I'm now using aASUS 802.11b/g/n Portable Wireless Router (WL-330N)to give it a wireless connection through it's LAN jack and it's working as it should.The symptoms are it gives me an internal fault and says the jack is unplugged.  ya, it's unplugged.  It was wireless.  But, after it crashes, the wireless options just vanish from the menu and it wants a hard-line.  Fine.  Whatever.  I knocked off yet another star for poor firmware.edit 9/18/2013 - I was able to get more life out of the radio by connecting my wireless gateway to the RJ45 jack, thereby bypassing whatever bugs they had in the wireless software which kept corrupting memory.  Still no firmware update is available.But, I am finally weary of the dance.  Power up.  See the \"\"Could not connect\"\" error.  Press #1 on the presets.  Have it play for a few minutes then say \"\"Stream closed\"\" or stuck on \"\"Buffering.... 0%\"\" until I pressed the preset again or powered off and back on again.  I used the Grace iPhone app to cycle power on it from the other room to continue to listen.  Finally, ahhghgh.  I give up.I purchased the Sirius Tabletop Radio for half the price.  This is my second tabletop radio.  The first failed after several years of service.  The new radio connected and played flawlessly for hours until I powered it off.  Disadvantage: it only plays Sirius Radio.  Advantage:  I can play music by simply pressing the power button.Curse you, Grace Digital.  For such a wonderful design, your firmware is just awful and you are providing no updates.  I give up.\"", "\"This is my third product by Grace Digital, Allegro first one bought 8 years ago. I have Grace Allegro, Mondo and this Tuner. I liked all of them but now I have encountered an issue that I cannot overlook. Until I got this tuner I would usually stream stations of 128 to 160 kb, and they stream well with no issues. But when I got this tuner I started using high end headphones and found couple of stations with 256 and 320 kb quality. That is where the problem comes in. Constant buffering...At first I thought it was my WiFI, moved router closer, same room. WiFI quality is at 75% minimum, still buffering...Must mention I have Verizon 75MB internet connection. Try same station Micca EP350 G2 (http://www.amazon.com/Micca-EP350-G2-Network-HD-Audio/dp/B004GIZ61K/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) no problem at all, any station plays with no stuttering. So the conclusion the decoder cannot handle the stream at high bitrate ~256 and up. Shame, I wish Grace reads the reviews and if possible fix this with firmware, fix this issue.Update:Grace is one of those rare companies out there who still care about their reputation and their customers. I had exchanged emails with them before and every time they gave me a satisfactorily timely response. So in this case they responded to me explaining that there was a change in firmware at some point during production of this tuner that resolves the issue with high bit rate streams. Here is what they said:\"\"There are 3 internal product codes that we have for the Tuner and that looks like an old version, which when we sold it, did not support the higher bit rates. All new Tuners should not have an issue with higher bit rates and would have a product code of 663 or 514.\"\"Mine is Product Code 623. I thought that it might be an issue but what I didn't expect is for them to say we can replace it for you if you pay for shipping. This tuner is 4 years old and they still decide to support it and take care of an issue. Says something about the company, doesn't it? Grace is a great company.\"", "Eight Week Review.Love this tuner.  No problems at all.Moved it into my family room, as it is just too good to keep in the bedroom.Headphone jack is on the front of the tuner, which facilitates listening to the tuner with a straight jack (as opposed to an angled jack).My favorite station discovered with this tuner), is Vegas Baby.  Collection of outstanding music, with artists and titles shown on the screen.One point of comparison to the IPOD Touch.  On my Touch, with OOTunes app, I am able to go to a city, then go down to the exact station I want.  With this tuner, I can't readily do that, but scrolling to the country, and then the city, and the genre, is easy.  Gets me the type of music I want.  To get an exact station, I need to log in on the Grace website, type in the station, and make it a favorite.  Both the iPOD and this receiver do a great job.  My IPOD Touch was $ 300.  Both are excellent but different internet radios.  Apples to Oranges.  For home listening, the Grace tuner is a wonder.Four week review.At the 4 week mark, the tuner still performs flawlessly.I keep the tuner lights totally off at all times.  When you are actually tuning, they go on so you see what you are doing.  Otherwise, off.  Essential if you want a dark bedroom.  I found I was tuning wrong.  The round dial controls the sound, when you are listening to a station.  When you want to change the station, and click to go to the internet tuner, the same dial controls the tuning.  I was clicking the remote to find channels, which was tedious.Had a single problem.  Shut off the switch.  Turned it back on, the system rebooted and all was well.Overall assessment.  Still 5 stars.  Everyone will have an interent tuner, as they do a cellphone now. Incredible devices.Original review.A poorly written manual can greatly hamper a product's usefulness.  Unfortunately, so many product manuals are terrible. The manual is outstanding, and gets you online and fully functioning within minutes.  Another plus.  The manual is in print, not just online.I have read the two prior reviews, and rather than restate or agree with them, I'll provide additional information.First let me say that last year, I was researching internet radios, and based on a number of complaints, I opted to buy the Apple IPOD Touch - as my internet radio of choice.  Though the decision hasn't disappointed me, this new Grace product far surpasses my $300 IPOD Touch in ease of use, and reception.I elected to use this in my bedroom (night table), about 45 ft from my Linksys G router.  Reception is flawless, and in two days of heavy listening, not a single dropout has occurred.  The IPOD has had a number of dropouts, and I have to recycle the IPOD to resume playing. Conclusion.  The Grace has better Wi FI reception.While learning the product, my use of the remote did cause me to disconnect, but then going back to the station, the playing immediately resumed.  No problem or extra reset effort was involved.The tuner is infinitely easier to use than the IPOD Touch.  The format allows me to easily find categories I want.  The easiest way to add your favorite stations is to go to the Grace online site, type your station or call letters in (eg:  WBZ), and a list will appear showing that station by city.  Just click and it's now on your Grace tuner as a favorite.The clock and alarm clock work excellent.  Very easy to program.Speakers.  The tuner has no speakers.  Since I want this on my table, I wanted to connect my upgraded Dell Multimedia with subwoofer speakers. However, there is no jack on the tuner for this. I went to Walmart and bought a set of adapters.  One Y adapter hooked into the two RCA output jacks, and my speaker jack went into the single Y.  Plays great.  Also, there is a headphone jack on the front, but my IPOD headphone jack is too small.  You need a larger plus (standard earphones or adapter).Connected to my Pandora account.  Very easy.Cons and inconveniences:Both mornings, when I hit the remote on button, I received the message, Network unplugged.Also received several error codes.  I turned on the IPOD, and did have Wi Fi service functioning perfectly.I shut the main (total cutoff) switch located on the back of the receiver.  Waited 30 seconds and turned it on.  This caused the tuner to reboot and everything was fine.  However, if you set the alarm to radio, rather than buzzer, it won't go off, if the tuner thinks the Network is unplugged.I went to the Grace help forum, and the problem was addressed.  It said to go into settings, and enable wireless on during standby (meaning when it's off at night).Entering my Linksys WEP number at startup was a bit of a pain. You can't add the numbers by the remote, and have to turn the dial.  Easy to understand, but with my 20+ character WEP code, it was inconvenient.  Fortunately, this was the biggest inconvenience I encountered.The backlight was too bright to sleep.  Read the manual.  Go to settings, find backlight, lower or shut off backlight.Summary.  Though the tuner is very user friendly, there is still a good bit of learning involved.  Between the instruction manual and some trial and error, the learning is actually a pleasant experience.", "I had this unit for 5 days and returned it.  The rating I gave this unit of one star is not right, it should be  -5 stars.  This unit has some really bad designs, first is the menu system display.  The LCD display is weird, like nothing I have ever seen, and being an Electronics Engineer for 35 years I have seen and worked on many displays. The return timing of the display is too fast, It doesn't give you time to think and make a decision. The large selector knob on the right feels like it is broken, the detents are soft, I didn't know whether I was at a stop or in transition between stops. The labeling of the push buttons is odd, the only sensible button label was  &#34;Back&#34;.  The remote control was a joke, made like a cheap toy. The buttons on the remote were not sensitive enough, I had to press hard and multiple times to see the selection on the display. A minor annoyance is the unnecessarily bright red LED light on the left that illuminates when the unit is off, weird. However, all of these design screw-ups I could live with if the unit worked as advertised.  I could not deal with intermittent internet break-ups of streaming audio. I have to assume the company went really cheap on Buffer memory.  I am not about to pay more per month for faster internet so this unit would work properly.", "\"My main goal was to stream the output of my computer (PC) soundcard (using a DLNA server like Jamcast) or the output of foobar2000 player installed on my computer (using foo_upnp plugin) to the Hi-Fi system in the living room one floor down (wired connection using powerline adapters). I prefer to manage my playlists at the computer and just stream them to the living room HiFi system. Plus this allows me to use the DSP chain on my computer (e.g. cross-fading, replaygain volume adjustment, etc) and serve the final digital stream to my HiFi system. This is called a \"\"DLNA infinite stream\"\" because it's not streaming discrete files.My secondary goal was to use this device to play internet radio streams without involving a PC.I don't care about the quality of this thing's onboard DAC (I am connecting it to the receiver via S/PDIF), and don't care about navigating the individual songs stored on my PC or NAS using the device's interface (I can imagine it would be a pain to navigate a large music library using ANY device without a keyboard).My issues:-this device does NOT render DLNA \"\"infinite streams\"\" correctly. Which means if you are trying to stream something that is not a discrete file (e.g virtual soundcard mode of Jamcast, or Playback Stream Capture feature of Foobar2000 + foo_upnp) then you are out of luck.-this device also did NOT work with at least some 128kbps AAC streams from internet radio stations, such as those from SomaFM (a pretty popular source)-the online interface for managing your \"\"preset\"\" internet radio stations is slow and not as clean and easy to use as the one for Squeezebox Touch.In the end I got a working solution using my new Harman Kardon AVR 2650 receiver, which was able to stream both virtual soundcard mode of Jamcast and Playback Stream Capture feature of Foobar2000 + foo_upnp (both in LPCM). The DLNA Renderer feature of AVR 2650 seems much more reliable and solid. Although it lacks the impressive listing of accepted formats of the Grace Digital player (which are anyway half-truths at best as evidenced by the above issues), it streams LPCM and MP3 reliably. That is all I really need, since all the decoding of all audio formats happens on my computer, and the final stream is then sent to the receiver as LPCM. Although the receiver had its internet radio and podcast player interface also, I did not like it as much and instead ended up getting the Logitech Squeezebox Touch for easy access to internet radio and podcasts in the living room.\"", "Easy to setup.  Excellent internet radio selections.  I use it with the optical outputs to my home theatre system.  I use it with the ethernet connection so can't comment on the wifi (which it does have).  There is no stuttering or buffer problems that plagued early internet radio products.  Unlike other internet radio products, this one looks great amidst your hi fi components!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.001070030266419053, 0.09762974083423615, 0.043189454823732376, 0.0002696897427085787, 0.03696663677692413, 0.001823296071961522, 0.00015636396710760891, 0.1732816994190216, 0.03912775591015816, 0.054463569074869156, 0.012488076463341713, 0.06695079058408737, 0.10700356960296631, 0.02804526314139366, 0.19991523027420044, 0.0018710425356402993, 0.004145523998886347, 0.00015413205255754292, 0.0002086990134557709, 0.0009047628263942897, 0.13033460080623627]]}
