But we all had fun opening it and playing with it.  I told them I was having my first childhood not my second, since I was way too serious as a child and they didn't have cool toys like this.It comes in Try Me mode so it was barking and snuffling while we unwrapped it.  I wondered what the UPS man thought if he could hear all that going on in the box.One really great thing is that it was not as hard as usual to get unwrapped.  Those annoying fasteners that hold the toy to the box are made of string and not plastic, easy to unroll or cut.  Getting the leash handle out of the plastic was the only frustrating part.I would not stereotype this as a girl's toy and I ordered it to entertain my two grandsons (ages 5 and 1)when they are staying with us.  The one year old hasn't seen it, but I suspect that he will enjoy watching it.  The older grandson played with it and it kept his attention for about as long as any toy does.  He had no problem figuring out how the remote works.I have no idea of the durability.  It is not really cuddly because it is not soft.Over all I think it is a fun toy, but way too expensive in my opinion.", "This dog is life-like and is great toy for girls.  That being said, I tried this for my two boys.  I want them to get used to dogs (grandma and granpa have one), and to get used to following commands.  The functions of this toy are wonderful, but I don't see major educational value.  So far the older one likes to pet the dog and play with the controls on the leash.  The younger guy just tackles it.All in all it's a cute toy, but I would have passed if I didn't have a specific need for it (i.e. getting my boys used to a small dog).  On the other hand, my friends with young girls found a big benefit with this - msotly it wasn't another Barbie!", "The below review doesn't matter anymore because the dog has officially died after very little use.My 7-year old daughter and 3- year old son are really enjoying this toy. We have a real golden retreiver that they love to play with, so I was not sure how they would respond to this toy.  They seem to love it. They walk it and pat it and hold it.  The toy responds well to the controls.  It has wheels on its paws that roll, so it goes well on hard surfaces like wood & tile flooring. It also seems to spontaneously bark and cry and wag its tale. At this point, I can't say how durable it is or how long the batteries last. The leash attaches and can be taken off the dog's collar with the push of a button.  The kids may grow bored with it but for now they like it.  The main question is whether it is worth the cost--that is something for each consumer to weigh.", "My 12 year old daughter already has Squawkers McCaw, the FurReal parrot, so she jumped at the opportunity for the GoGO My Walkin' Pup.  The toy's name says it all.  While the parrot dances, repeats, and plays little games, this dog basically walks.  You can move it four different direction using it's leash.  Perhaps a good tool for getting little one's use to walking the family pet.  The dog pants, wags it's tail, and whimpers if you ignore it.  If you pet it, it responds.  It's not quite as exciting as the parrot, but it's a cute little dog without having to pick up its little messes.", "I didn't know what to expect from the walking toy dog!One of my grandkids is almost 2, and loves it. He has figured outthe remode and takes it for a little walk on the kitchen floor.It has wheels on the inside part of all each leg, where you can't see them.The fur covers them.One of the buttons on the remote has the dog turning to right, then another button goingto the left, and one walking straight. The leash and remode are made out of plastic. Hope it lasts for awhile!I would not consiter this a cuddlie doggy toy. Its kind of heavy, and seems tohave a type of cardboard/hard plastic body , the fur covers it pretty good.But the dog is very cute. The mouth is open with a pink tongh (sp?).There is a 3 way switch under the dog.1-  off.2-  on.3-  sleeping mode. All though in this mode if you walk by, touch the dog it moves abit, and pants.Two of my little dogs are afraid of it, but my medium size dog would love to play with it!We have found that we as adults are having fun playing with the dog.I'm not sure I would pay the price for this dog for the Children to play with. I think they would be bored with it in a short time. Maybe I'm thinking boys would get bored with this!That said, I think a little girl, about 3 or 4 yrs olds, would love this, could cumb the fur, and love to walk it up and down the street, or in the house. And have the dog sleep near by her, as her special pet toy.This comes with batteries.", "I have two daughters, age 9 and 2.  They are both animal lovers.  So when the Amazon box arrived murmuring barks and pants, it was with great anticipation that they awaited its opening.  I was happy too because that sound meant the toy came equipped with batteries (4 C cells).They were delighted when they saw the cute and fluffy GoGo dog.  They were even more tickled when I took her from the box and showed them what she could do.  GoGo does more than just bark and walk a few steps like her older cousins from decades ago.  This dog has sensors in its head and on both sides of its body which allow it to act and react like a live dog.  GoGo makes 18 different sounds and several motions such as tail wagging, head tilting, mouth movement etc.  It even responds to touch and can actually go for a walk with you on its provided leash, which is detachable.Your kids won't be cuddling with GoGo at bedtime though.  As cute and fluffy as GoGo appears, she's not a plush doll.  She's a mechanical dog.  One touch will tell you that.  It's legs have wheels of course so it can move along the floor or smooth ground.GoGo has an on/off switch as well as a sleep mode that engages after one minute of non-activity.  This is great because the 4 C cell batteries required for operation will last longer that way.  I think the weight of the C batteries also contribute weight stability to the toy.All in all, my kids thoroughly love GoGo and all her antics, although it may be a bit pricey for some at $60.", "\"I've observed one 4 year old and two 2 1/2 year olds playing with the FurReal GoGo My Walkin' Pup. One of the 2 1/2 year olds - my granddaughter - is shy around it (she seems to have a \"\"thing\"\" about small dogs, and she shied away form it as it was being unboxed, as it comes with batteries installed and in an active demo mode, and it yips and moves when being removed from the packaging it comes in; my granddaughter was less than thrilled about this, but I suppose I should note that the toy is recommended for ages 4 and up, though judging by the video available at Hasbro's page for this toy it would appear that they are trying to market it girls a bit older then 4). The other two children, the 2 1/2 year old boy and his 4 year old sister, have played with it on several occasions and have a lot of fun playing with when they play with it. They named it \"\"Max,\"\" make up stories about Max (at one point they rescued him from a sinking ship), walk Max, feed Max, and the 4 year old has used plastic bags to pick up Max's (imaginary) p**p. The 2 1/2 year old uses the remote but doesn't seem to know what he's doing, whereas his 4 year old sister is able to use it as well as I and her mom can.Both of the children who are not shy around Max seem to find it a plus that the remote leash can be removed as this enables them to, well, unleash Max (which I assume reinforces the fantasy that taking Max for walks is like taking an actual, biological, non-robotic \"\"Canis lupus familiaris\"\" for a walk), and hold Max on their laps and hug Max, etc.But the novelty seems to be wearing off each time the children in question have an opportunity to play with Max.The toy seems well made, durable, sturdily built; my guess is that it will last for years (e.g., long enough for my granddaughter to hopefully enjoy it after she turns 4) as long as it isn't subjected to abuse (dropped from a 2nd floor window, hosed down to \"\"wash Max,\"\" put into a bathtub or wading pool full of water, etc.). As I anticipated, the batteries wear down fairly quickly (I buy batteries for battery-eating toys and gadgets by the box from Amazon - Durcell Procell Alkaline Batteries are usually a good deal and seem to last as long as I expect non-premium priced disposable alkaline batteries to last).I knock a star off because of the observation (shared by me and two moms) that while the FurReal GoGo My Walkin' Pup is a nice toy, it is a novelty and as tends to be the case where novelties are concerned, the novelty eventually wears off. Also based on observation, this toy really is best suited to children 4 and older.\"", "FurReal GoGo My Walkin' Pup is a real fun electronic toy that I'm sure the youngsters will love.  The toy comes with the batteries that are needed so don't worry if about it after you purchase it.  The dog has a remote control leash (you connect it to the collar) and it barks, whines and wags it's tail like a real dog.  The only drawback is that the dog wont go backwards, so you'll have to either move it left or right if it gets stuck.  A control panel on the bottom of the dog allows you to turn it off, on or in demo mood.  The dog likes to be patted on it's head and it'll whine if left unattended.  I have to recommend this toy for youngster around 4 years old and up.  You can also groom the dog by brushing it's faux fur as well.  A neat toy that I'm sure the little ones will enjoy.", "\"GoGo looks very realistic and has a lovely face and soft fur. The barking sounds real also. GoGo barks when you pet her or come near. This is good and bad. It makes you feel like you've got a real pup in the house, but you'll definitely want to turn her off at night. The constant barking can wear on the nerves. Also you'll want to conserve the batteries. She works on 4 \"\"C\"\" batteries.The age recommendation on the front of the package says it's for kids age 4 and over. I can understand that. My toddler is only 2 and she can work the controls on the leash but she also tries to sit on the puppy occasionally. Even so, GoGo still works.GoGo is a nice alternative to actually having a real pet. She hasn't made a poop yet!\"", "I got this for my grandson, but because of the pink leash and collar, it is more for a girl. The dog is adorable. It barks, wags its tail and comes already equipped with batteries (gotta love a company that supplies the first set of batteries!). We had a great time with this little rascal. The legs move giving the impression that the dog is walking, when in fact, the dog runs on wheels cleaverly hidden under the fur of its stomach. The remote works well and there's no puddles to clean up at the end of the day. While the toy has limited entertainment value, I can see a child having a great time walking their new puppy. My only complaint is that it isn't very soft, so your child will probably not be sleeping with it. This is a perfect toy for a child who can't have a real pet or is not old enough for the responsibility of one. I love that it doesn't stare at me all through dinner, begging for a piece of my chicken.", "\"My daughter got this from Santa and she LOVES it....when it works. Becuase there is no automatic shut off, or sleep mode, if you do not shut it off, it will kill the batteries really fast....like a day or so! It takes 4 C batteries and we are off to the local \"\"wholesale\"\" club to buy a couple of boxes of C batteries, just to get a few days of use out of it. This is my biggest problem with this toy. My daughter is 5.5 years old and she doesn't mind the simplicity of the toy (though for the money, it's pretty basic), what upsets her is having a toy that doesn't work becuase she forgot to turn it off overnight. Granted, she will learn to shut it off sooner or later, but compared to her other toys and dolls, this things dies out SO much faster than anything she has. Even when she/we do remember to shut it off, it only gives you a few days of LIGHT use before the batteries are toast. Within 6 months, expect to pay as much on batteries as you (or Santa) paid for the toy. I almost wish it had an AC adapter (of course it would kill the functionality of the toy) or D batteries, or have lithium ions built in and let it recharge, or??? I guess we are lucky that it doesn't need triple A batteries! LOL. I think that the simplicity of the toy as well as the horrible battery life warrants a 2.5 star rating. Just to note, my sons remote control cars last for days of heavy use with 4 C batteries!\"", "Looks quite realistic, and was bigger than I thought it would be.I would advise caution about having this toy if you have a toddler in thehouse, we are still teaching my grandson how to be nice to real dogs and cats,and this toy makes that a little confusing since it looks real, but doesn'tnip or scratch like a real pet would.", "\"I looked on the product page before this arrived to see what kind of batteries it would need.  I didn't see any mention of this, so I was pleased it came with a set of batteries.  It does require 4 \"\"C\"\" batteries, if you want to have extras on hand.I was glad that my tester was here when this cute pup arrived.  My grandson is 3years, 1 month.  The recommended age begins at 4.  This is probably a pretty good recommendation.  While a younger child will be interested, there are things they just won't be able to do.  For example, for it to do a half-turn, you need to hold down the forward button at the same time as either the left turn button or the right turn button.  I also hope the leash controls are sturdy because it has been dropped several times as well as being used to drag the dog.This dog wasn't just built for walking using the remote control.  If you pet her on the head, she will make excited noises while moving her head up and down and wagging her tail.  There are even sensors on the sides.  This dog might even whine to beg you to pet a little longer!  If you stop playing for about a minute, the dog will go into \"\"daydreaming\"\" mode and won't move or make sounds.  Activate any sensor and it will wake up.  They recommend using the off position for the switch on the bottom to save on battery usage.  While on the subject of sensors, the dog will stop moving when you pick it up.  If it won't move forward, you should check to see if the \"\"pickup\"\" switch is turned on.  It's on the right rear wheel.I think my grandson is having a good time with this pup.  He just \"\"walked\"\" it until it's in front of my dog's food and told it to eat!  He's really into imaginary play and this will add to that.  He walks his dogs with his dad frequently.\"", "\"My kids find the GoGo Pup very entertaining.  They are quite young, and as such can't be left unattended with it, though they enjoy watching it walk and bark.  They want to pick it up and hug it, but it's not particularly plush or light.  It's definitely made for floor entertainment and that's it.  It comes with batters, and as it arrives on \"\"Try Me,\"\" mode, a setting that activates upon interaction but turns off when idle, the box shakes and rattles...  and barks.  The remote on the leash has buttons for the Pup to move forward, left and right.  As long as you stay on level floor it glides along fine.  It doesn't handle uneven surfaces well, which begs the question of just how well it would do on most streets, where it is pictured being used on its packaging.  Its turn radius isn't very precise, and it doesn't back up.  If you are using Pup in a tight area, you will have to pick it up and turn it around quite a lot.  Seems natural in theory, as dogs rarely back up.  But for a toy that rolls along, this seems to be an oversight in smooth function.  It also sheds terribly.My kids are young, younger than the recommended age for the toy, so they will not be playing with it unattended, or using the leash.  The leash disconnected at the collar, so the Pup can be played with solo and still enjoy its barking, frolicking antics.  It's fun.  I don't imagine it will entertain them for long, which makes me think the suggested age range on the package is more for safety reasons and not true developmental interest.\"", "\"GoGo is a re-release of a product that existed in 2003. The older version and this newer version don't have exactly the same features. One of the ways to tell the difference is that the 2010 version, which this review is about, has long ears.Aside from a \"\"remote control\"\" for manageable walking, GoGo (referred to as \"\"she\"\" in the manual) also has other features. In fact, even though this is the only feature mentioned in the manufacturer's write-up, the dog really doesn't need to be on the leash--it's detachable. Aside from a light sensor, there are sensors on the head, left side of the body, and right side of the body. When touched in these areas, the toy will respond, such as turning the head, barking (she's supposed to make 18 different noises, but the mouth does not move in conjunction with them), and wagging the tail. She'll also take a few \"\"steps\"\" on her own. When detached from the leash like this, though, GoGo isn't active nonstop, so I would most equate her to being a remote control (though tethered) \"\"car\"\" for girls.GoGo can be turned off when not in use; a welcome feature since she requires four C-sized batteries (the first are included with the dog). Unlike a real dog, though, this one will go into sleep mode after one minute of non-interaction. For some this may seem a little early, and may even be disappointing if it's expected that GoGo will \"\"live\"\" on her own.GoGo isn't snuggly--she's hard and stiff like a robot. Her exterior is a mix of cute and not-so-cute yet practical for movement. Each of GoGo's front legs is like half a cup (hollow) and swings front and back when the dog is \"\"walking.\"\" Under the dog, there are four wheels for movement. The \"\"fur\"\" on the ears is curly (the ears are temporarily tacked down for packing), short on the head, long on the body, and there is non-fur fabric on the belly, along with an on/off/try me switch. The collar on the dog is permanent, allowing for attachment of the leash. The leash cord is attractive and looks like the nylon cording of a genuine leash. The remote has the look (though not the function) of a retractable dog leash handle, with buttons for left, right, and forward.As mentioned before, GoGo is probably most useful if treated as a \"\"remote control\"\" product rather than an interactive robot. The exterior of the product packaging is all about being outdoors with the dog. The package interior design features GoGo on grass. The \"\"care guide\"\" (manual) is available for free on the manufacturer's website, and page three explains the types of surfaces that are not suitable for GoGo. Based upon this, the images on the product packaging, including grass, may not be suitable. While the idea is to walk the dog outdoors, this may prove impractical if following the manufacturer's guidelines. I recommend reading the manual first to see if your home and neighborhood have the types of surfaces that will safely accommodate GoGo. The reason this is important is because the dog moves on wheels, which pull up on things present on any surface she walks on. I have to regularly turn GoGo over to remove hair from the wheels.While GoGo can interact with users as a \"\"robot\"\" with sensors, I think she's mostly a good choice for a girl who wants a cute, furry alternative to a remote control car. The dog may even be a positive encouragement to get girls outdoors and exercising.\"", "Added to the review:  Dog broke 1 weeks after I had it.  No longer moves, troubleshooting/turning off/on didn't work.  It's DOA.I think the right age for this doggie is about 7 or younger.  It walks well indoors and outdoors, which is great. It also walks very slow so I don't need to worry about kids tripping or following it to dangerous places.  But that slow speed means that the older kids get bored easily waiting for the dog to actually get somewhere.It looks durable and the controller is easy to use.  The dog has some cute barking noises but, unlike the other furreal pets, this really isn't about interaction with a lap pet so much as being able to 'walk a dog' on their own.In all, I am pleased with the dog and my 7 year old loves it.  Just watch for uneven pavement, grass, etc - those trip up the dog and he falls over."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.058760933578014374, 0.06663157045841217, 0.06681911647319794, 0.06862211227416992, 0.07351011782884598, 0.05425059050321579, 0.06348549574613571, 0.05603658780455589, 0.05566500872373581, 0.06732092052698135, 0.06619850546121597, 0.06599216163158417, 0.05979251489043236, 0.05461741238832474, 0.06275127828121185, 0.05954567715525627]]}
