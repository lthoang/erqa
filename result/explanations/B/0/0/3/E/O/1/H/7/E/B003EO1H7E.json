I will NEVER buy this brand again. Buy Sandisk original", "This is a review of the Transcend 16GB USB Flash Drive.  It resembles the SanDisk Cruzer in size and attributes.  The USB connector slides in and out of the black casing.  The indicator light is lit when it is connected to the computer, and flashes when data is transferred to/from the unit.  There is an area to attach a neck cord (which I do not use), but does not come with one anyway.I transfer a lot of files from work to home, and between various computers at work.  The folders can reach 8GB and higher.  I am trying out various flash drives to see which ones I like.  I decided to give this one a try, especially since I got it for 20 dollars.I have a higher-end workstation PC the following specs:  Dell Precision 490, Quad-core Intel Xeon 5300, 4GB DDR2 fully buffered DIMM 667MHz ECC memory, Dual ATI FireGL V7200, WD Raptor 160 GB, WinXP Pro SP3.Using Flash Memory Tookit v2.0, I got fairly linear read/write speeds using various file sizes (1MB to 15MB).  The average write speed was 9.5 MB/s, and read speeds of 20.3 MB/s (19.3 - 20.7 MB/s range).  This is fast!!!  I posted the screen captures of these benchmarks here.Using real files with sizes from 3MB (JPEG), 150MB (avi), 400MB (psd), and 1024MB (VOB), the read and write speeds were slightly faster than benchmark speeds.  Average values were Read 22 MB/s and Write 14 MB/s.  That is impressively fast.  The 1GB file took about 60 seconds to copy this file onto the drive, and about 40 seconds to copy it from the thumb drive onto my computer.  This is 2x faster read BUT OVER 10x faster to write than the SanDisk Cruzer!!!  I then copied various folders (about 1GB total size) containing various file sizes, and it took two minutes to copy a folder onto the thumb drive, and 1 minute to copy from the thumb drive.  This translates to about a write speed of about 9 MB/s and read of about 18 MB/s.  Very impressive, indeed!  This unit blows away the SanDisk Cruzer in just about every way I can think of, even price!Overall, the Transcend Jetflash (16GB) is a great USB flash drive, and the low cost makes it one of the best affordable flash drives in speed, quality and price IMHO.  I gave my sister my SanDisk Cruzer.  I am now considering the 32 GB version.  I highly recommend this flash drive.", "\"Despite the \"\"optimal\"\" speed values advertised here, this is only about 10% faster than the SanDisk, meaning no more than about 4.4MB/s writes.  USB 2.0 as a standard is once again being misused.  You can easily do a search to see what a quality USB 2.0 device should be capable of, more along the lines of 10-30MB/s.As for the build quality, to me it seems the same as the SanDisk.  Size wise, this is about 1/4\"\" longer.  Also, it has no hole to attach a ring or string.From now on, I stick to USB 3.0, either brand, as drives sold at that standard perform much better even in a USB 2.0 slot.  For example, my Transcend 32GB Voyager will write at 25MB/s in a USB 2.0 slot.  It gets this speed because it uses a high-quality flash memory chip.By using the catch-all standard of USB 2.0, companies sell flash drives using the worst performing memory they can find, and then expect us to think we are getting a good deal.  Wrong:  We are getting lousy chips.My advice is spend a little more and get a larger capacity USB 3.0 drive that you can fill in less time than these smaller pieces of junk.  You actually pay about the same per GB, and, even on a USB 2.0 slot, end up getting 4 to 5 times faster performance.  On a USB 3.0 slot, your data will be flying.I'm sending this back because the \"\"optimal\"\" speeds listed above are misleading.  (You can't get any more optimal than my desktop or laptop computers, and they are only getting about half of what is advertised.)\"", "I'm not a power user, but I did need a good drive with a good amount of available storage for my day to day work.  My old drives had gotten flimsy and started having errors copying/reading data, so a new one was in order.I like this product and it seems to work very well in any device in which I use it.For me and my general use, it works fine.  I suspect these drives are becoming obsolete with so many other ways of moving data today (Dropbox, Google drive, ...wireless sharing...storage on phones, tablets, etc..), so really this might be the last USB drive I end up buying.", "What can you say about a USB thumb drive, except it runs pretty fast (I downloaded a speed tester and it tested OK), and I have not lost any data yet.  While I don't recommend that you try this, I washed this device with some jeans and it can out of the dryer still working!-rwg", "Works just as good as anyone I could buy in a store. i use it to store movies, as well as school work and projects.", "Price wise its good, but the product itself feels very cheap (well that's we paid for). Not very stable to use on tight spots but once you pass through that, so far so good for its use.", "It works fine and it was a good price.  The plastic housing is just very brittle.  It would probably crack if you squeezed on it hard enough.", "\"One of the complaints I see a lot about these high capacity jump drives is failure of the media, which will then not reformat, leaving a dead device.I've been using this regularly for three months now with no problem. I haven't really used a lot of these over the years, so I'm no expert on how \"\"fast\"\" they are supposed to save and read files. However, I haven't at any time felt like I was waiting too long for even large file transfers to complete.The unit has a convenient slide to protect or extrude the USB connector. When fully extruded, it locks into position so that you don't just push the USB connector back into the cover when you try to plug it into a computer. However, make sure that you aren't putting pressure on the slide button when trying to plug it in, or you can accidentally release it anyway.I'm happy with this device and feel no qualms about recommending it to other customers.\"", "It's an attractively priced USB flash drive which works fine, is decent quality, has good capacity, and is very convenient for transferring files and other typical uses.  What more do you want?  ;)Thumbs up!", "I have been using Transcend Flash memory cards for digital cameras and camcorders in the family for several years and all ordered thru Amazon with no problems and great prices. First time buyer on these but other reviews were very good. Wanted two for loading music to play in cars. Did not want one with a cap to lose. My, how prices have dropped in the last few years and memory grown! I got 8 Gigs for about $8 each. I loaded 400 of my favorite &#34;oldies&#34; songs on one and only used 1.2 Gigs. Looks like I can load about 2000 songs total. Got a second one for a son to do the same thing. He has yet to even getting close to filling his up with all his music. Mine fits perfect in the USB outlet in my center console. I had CD's stuck everywhere on my last vehicle that was 10 years old, had no USB, was in a wreck and totaled. New Mazda had the Aux and USB outlets. This JetFlash takes up virtually no space in the vehicle compared to all those CD's in door panels, console, glove box and just loose! Great deal for this old guy who loves his oldies and all in one very neat little package - How do they do that???  Been working flawlessly for me so far. Real good BANG FOR YOUR BUCKS!", "I've used these for over a year now. They're reliable but they're slow.If you need speed, there are better choices out there.", "I keep a good portion of my mp3s stored on one of these drives and I plug it into the back of my laptop dock so it's out of the way. I don't know how iTunes or Window Media Player handles playback from a portable flash drive, but the free open-source media player VLC does just fine. I like this approach because I can take the disk with me and use it in my car or on any of my computers. It's convenient and the drive is fast enough to allow seamless playback of nearly 15 gb of tunes and that's fast enough for me! I've got a bunch of different brands of flash drives and this one works as good as any. Plus, the asking price -- $13.00 with free shipping -- makes this a great value.Note: For the reviewers who have experienced a failed drive, remember to contact Transcend. They'll replace it for free because this model has a lifetime warranty.", "I ordered this one along with a 16GB version for a relative and myself. They work as they should and are quite nice. The flash drive is faster than my old PNY 4 GB, so that is always good. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the build quality. Compared to my PNY USB flash drive, this one is flimsy. I feel that if I accidentally drop this thing a few times, the plastic shell would break apart and all I would have left is the insides. I'm not saying that this will be the case if I actually drop so but this is how the build quality makes me feel. I'm trying to keep this review short so if you want a decent flash drive that is fast for a low price, Transcend is the way to go.", "luckily i copied my data and didn't move it completely...and luckily XboxLIVE has a recover profile option otherwise all my saves and other data would be completely gone. thumbs way down. unfortunately didn't see the other negative reviews before using this drive. junk.", "Despite the low price absolutely no problems, but be prepared for long write times when copying multi-gig files to this drive!", "Well, not a whole lot to say really.  I am not one of these guys that runs all kinds of speed tests etc. for these kinds of things.  I plugged it into my Macbook Pro, it saw it, copied files onto it trouble-free and moved them to another device.  Worked like a charm.  No complaints here.", "What can I say about this that hasn't already been said but buy as much storage as you can because as our lives move to more digital you're gonna need more storage.  Be sure to compare the Amazon frustration free packaging to the retail packaging because the prices vary a little. At the time of writing this review the price difference between the 8 GB and 16 GB was so small you should pay the extra for the 16 GB.All that being said the reason I like drives like this versus many of the other drives on the market is a don't have a stupid cap to lose. Most USB thumb drives have a little cap you slide on over the USB port and has most people will attest this will get lost eventually in your purse in your pants on the ground it will be gone never to be seen again leaving the USB connection exposed to the elements. But here like this slides its USB port into the key keeping a protected I highly recommend getting it because of that very feature.I hope you found this informative thanks for reading.", "Got this for my mother because she wanted something to save kids movies for my nephew and play them on her new Samsung TV, I was using another cheap Chinese drive which transfer rate was like 2mb per second and movies were stuttering while playing.This Transcend 32 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive is very fast and seems sturdy which is really good.Looks like it will last years without ever fail.I can't find any cons with this purchase, shipping was fast and came well protected in a padded envelope.Transcend 32 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive [Amazon Frustration Free Package] - TS32GJF500 (Black)", "Does the job it was intended for.  They have word limits on these reviews which for something like this is frustrating.  It works fine and the price was right.", "Great little storage device, and no cap to lose means I like the retractable idea!  I will undoubtedly order more!", "Nice size flash drive with dependability.  A bit slow but it more than makes up for it in other ways.  I lost the flash drive yesterday, or thought I did, and heard something in my dryer.  Surprisingly, the flash drive made it through washing and drying inside my jeans and still works.  A first for me.", "No issues with formatting or corruption - good, basic flash drive. Would buy again, good alternative for on the go memory needs.", "Bought this to replace a dead 8GB Sandisk Cruzer Micro. IT was only $6 from Amazon lightning deal. Excellent replacement for the Sandisk. Speeds are faster than the Sandisk,the design is the same, and it costs less. It also did not come with any software on the drive, unlike the Sandisk. I would definitely recommend this over the ubiquitous Sandisks cruzers.", "\"It's a 32 GB thumb drive and it works fine. But it feels cheap. Made of thin plastic, I can see how it could easily crack or shatter if mishandled. I wouldn't buy this as a \"\"carry along\"\" drive. Too flimsy. The purple color makes it look cheap as well...IMHO.\"", "I love this thumbdrive.  It works exactly as you expect, is very fast, and has a great value for its size and speed.Recommended", "The size comes in handy, but it is very slow.  After several tests, it yielded between 6-8 mb/s.  Large files, like movies take for-ev-er....  Otherwise ok.", "I needed a new 16GB flash drive and this was on sale for $21, so I bit.  The speed isn't the best, but it's decent and for the price, I can't complain.

So I could have gotten better read speeds if I got the Verbatim 16GB that I was looking at, it was also 50% higher in price.  So for a cheap drive, this works fine.  Also glad to not have to deal with caps.", "This unit became entirely inaccessible for input within a few weeks of usage and within another few weeks became inaccessible even to out-load - requiring a complete reformat to even function. Lost 100 hours of work.During that same period, plugged into the same USB Hub, my several SansDisk units of both micro and standard formats, continued to work flawlessly. So - I bought another SansDisk 32gB and opted for the Kingston 64gB this time.", "A good basic all-around USB drive.  I'm not really a fan of retractables but this one doesn't seem to have a hard time staying extended or seem too loose either.  I'm happy with this as I got it on the Black Friday sale.  Either way, if you find a good price, this is a good choice for this kind of product.  Hasn't failed me yet, highly recommended.", "It stores stuff in a flash, more portable than your favorite chapstick, and now you can carry all your favorite pictures and videos to distract all your coworkers.", "... This only comes up as a 15gb flash drive. It doesn't even say, 15gb free out of 16gb like some other drives do that have a bit of software on them. It kist says 15gb free out of 15gb. I bought this because a client I was working with wanted me to mail him some files that I wasn't able to send through the internet, and the total size of all of it comes to about 13gb. So it's plenty of room for that (although the transfer rate is deathly slow), but if you're already in a situation where you're trying to squeeze a lot of files onto the drive and pack it as full as possible, that 1gb of space that's advertised but not actually there, is going to make a huge difference.So this is useful for what I need it for. But if I was planning on owning this for a long time and using it to back up files or transfer things back and forth frequently, I would definitely pass and look for something else."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0005219705053605139, 6.519276212202385e-05, 7.110835576895624e-05, 0.026079518720507622, 0.08039075881242752, 0.0018735210178419948, 0.05928758159279823, 0.07458291202783585, 0.006496338173747063, 0.011388203129172325, 0.00021825182193424553, 0.0002944032312370837, 0.0010255977977067232, 0.08911199122667313, 0.0006713852635584772, 0.009820572100579739, 0.07042980194091797, 0.0008035280043259263, 0.0033753381576389074, 0.049663763493299484, 0.056191083043813705, 0.042511940002441406, 0.058585863560438156, 0.07589488476514816, 0.07884448766708374, 0.05278366804122925, 0.06325878202915192, 0.0004854823346249759, 0.00027585169300436974, 0.005968027748167515, 0.0690232515335083, 0.010005022399127483]]}
