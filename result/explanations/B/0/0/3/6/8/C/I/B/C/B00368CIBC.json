It was also the most powerful & reasonable card listed that did not have a fan. I was looking for a \"\"silent\"\" video card. I also wanted something to be able to migrate to the home theatre / TV PC environment.The interface has an HDMI & DVI connector on the board and the card will produce 7.1 sound through the HDMI connection. It will permit a connection to a TV simultaneously with a DVI monitor.This is a big jump from theATI Radeon HD 2400 Pro - Graphics adapter - Radeon HD 2400PRO - PCI Express x16 low profile - 128 MB DDR2 - DVI ( HDCP ) - TV outthat came with the system from Dell. I have had a great experience with theSapphire Radeon HD4550 512 MB DDR3 VGA/DVI/HDMI PCI-Express Video Card 100252HDMIon Windows XP. I expect to find the same satisfaction in future months with this, of course with increased performance. A move to migrate to Windows 7 gave me the impetus to move to a better video card.Except for serious gaming, this is a great all-around card providing all the functionality most people would normally need. Still, the Windows Experience Index performance tool jumped 1.8 in the Graphics and 2.0 in the Gaming Graphics categories with the upgrade to this card. I think that's quite an improvement.It was supposed to work Plug and Play in Windows 7. The Windows 7 Compatibility website said that \"\"This product installs automatically without extra software.\"\" Well, it did not. I simply loaded generic VGA drivers. So keep he disk ready to install & use the \"\"Download the Latest ATI Driver\"\" option.I later went and downloaded the full ATI Catalyst from the manufacturer.\"", "The card works and works well for what it's built to do. It's not the best or most awesome video card by far, it's nothing that will wow or impress you. But it works for what it's meant to do.", "This Video Card product is the poor man's answer to the GPU co-processing demands by Photoshop CS5/CS6. It works out of the box, I just needed to update the driver. With 1 GB of video RAM, this product allows me to process all the special effects for large Photos (in excess of 16 Mega Pixels) in Photoshop that demand a great amount of GPU co-processing to render. For example, Adobe's Pixel Bender effect is rendered in less than 10 seconds with this card. Connections are flexible with DVI, VGA and HDMI, all produce sharp fonts/characters on screen and exceptional color dynamics. No need for me to go up to the expensive nVIDIA Quadro (or equivalent) products. Highly recommended for its price and solid performance.", "I'm the owner of Tech Reviews and Help, and this product is great. This chip is currently in my computer and it works well. The only problem with it is you can't run super high end games on it, but you can do a lot of CAD and other work with it.This is a buy", "I ordered it along with the High-Speed HDMI Cable 9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters from Amazon, so I could easily stream from my computer to the TV with the HDMI.  Installed it into a Dell Dimension E510.  I read that XP sets aside the amount of memory that's on the card also on the RAM so I upgraded that first from 1GB to 4GB (3.6) The 305W power supply was plenty, although I do not use it for gaming, just photo editing and video streaming.  My audio is on Mother board and I did not have to jumper any cables and the audio came through the HDMI output without any issues.  I put Hotkey for setup between two different resolution settings as icons on the desk top so the kids can easily choose between TV and computer monitor with one click.  Love it just wish I had done this months ago.  HDMI cable was a tight fit as the connector pushed up against the VGA cable connector, but got it to fit.  No fan means no noise.  Remember any time you open up the computer is a good time to blow out all the dust which can act as a blanket on the components keeping them hot.Follow on post:I discovered that the video card hijacked the sound from the motherboard.  After much internet searching and attempts at getting my audio from motherboard back for the computer speakers and still have audio on the HDMI  to the TV I had to settle with toggling between the two using the sounds and audio device settings in control panel sound playback default device field and choosing between the two. A better mother board (non Dell) would have given me me more audio selection options, or a separate audio card may have given me the option to have audio for my speakers as well as the HDMI on the video card but it is not the fault of the card.  It keeps the 5 stars.", "For the price it does everything it needs to do This brand has outlasted my other ones by a year now", "All I needed was a video card with dual outputs to hook up HDMI from pc to tv and this card does that.  Audio is fed through the HDMI cable so now able to watch anything on my tv including internet streams. Get an ir remote so you can control media center. I already had the one that came with my video capture card.The windows 7 experience index went from 3.4 with the onboard video to 4.4 with this card.  Nothing to brag about but I get a great picture to my monitor and tv.Installation was a snap. Booted up at terrible resolution until I downloaded and installed the latest drivers using the CD. Been perfect ever since.  And no fan...quiet.", "I bought this because my new Dell 580S can with on-board graphics. I chose this card because of positive reviews, the no-fan design, and the fact that it works in half-height settings. The card, packaging, and instructions were all good, and converting it from full-height to half-height was easily accomplished with a small pair of pliers and a very small Philips-head screwdriver. Upon installing the card and the driver from the company's website (one of the options from the install CD) I found that the Windows Experience Index for graphics had increased from only 4.5 to 4.6. Also, several places on the desktop had a degraded font display: in some spots text was bloated and rough-edged, and in other places (especially web browsers) the text was wispy and hard to read, almost out of focus. No amount of tweaking of the Clear Type system or the Catalyst driver would fix it.", "I don't play games.. I use my computer for business, shopping and word processing.  This card is really excellent.  I use it with HDCP and my old eyes thank me very much for getting this card.  Good size.. doesn't have the fan, and the power demands are way down.  Go for it.", "\"This is a pretty good workhorse of a video card. I built my own box using aBIOSTAR A780L3G AMD 780L Socket AM3 Motherboard, anAMD Phenom II X2 555 CPU, and 8GB of DDR3 RAM. That motherboard, like a lot of other inexpensive motherboards, shares onboard RAM between the CPU and for video purposes. The HIS Radeon HD 5450 was my successful attempt to upgrade my box from this situation, and I am quite happy with the results. I now get all 8 GB or RAM for computing purposes, and video performance is hugely improved.Though this might not be the BEST card for gaming purposes, I've found it to be a huge improvement, and adequate for my needs. I was using the demo version ofMass Effect 3which was REALLY choppy and laggy when set to default graphics. After installing this card, I can play the Mass Effect 3 demo at 1024 x 768 with most standard settings and will buy the full game based on this.My daughter couldn't playPortal 2on her laptop, it runs perfectly on my home built box with this card. My older games (bought 2-3 years ago) have lower graphics requirements and they all work fine. My \"\"Windows Experience\"\" graphics diagnostic indicate about a 20 percent improvement in \"\"3D Business and Gaming Graphics\"\" performance (the Windows Aero performance index didn't change at all from 4.6 - I don't use Aero so that's no big deal for me).The only problem I'm having is getting the card to run with an obscure wireless HDMI broadcaster I own which goes from my PC to my flat screen TV. I want to use it as an extra monitor. I'm pretty sure I'll get that working, and in no way could blame this on the card. Though it doesn't say this can handle multiple monitors on the box, the included CD with drivers indicates this can handle a second monitor. But, as I stated, my needs are a bit odd here.An easy 5 out of 5 stars for an inexpensive generic video card that does what it says.\"", "I initially thought that the incessant flickering on my screen with Win7 was due to a failing Nvidia 512mb graphic card. So I bought this card to replace my Nvidia card. Installation was quite easy and was accomplished without any hitches.Card works like a charm although I did note that my Win Aero performance index fell by about 0.5 points all due to what it perceives is a less competent card. Since almost all of my work involves only business graphics and some photo editing high speed graphics is of almost no importance. I am very pleased with the purchase especially given the price.Turns out my graphics problem was not due to graphics card failure since even after installation of the Radeon card the flickering still persisted. Some serious research on the Internet revealed that a utility I was using to clean my registry and improve computer performance set some video parameters way to much on the high side and fouled up my video operation. Used a suggested fix to my registry and the problem disappeared.There are literally  hundreds of forum articles dealing with the flickering problems and I bet many of them are due to well intentioned but poorly executed registry fixes by these so called  performance utilities. Be forewarned.Bottom line is the Radeon card works as promised and is a great price for a 1 Gig video card.", "I receipt the graphic card today on 1/14/2011, I installed and it's working..even the case is ASUS but inside is HIS..Thanks amazon"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.006840809714049101, 0.1990983784198761, 0.00021573457343038172, 0.20321856439113617, 0.00020526812295429409, 0.1784602552652359, 0.12171304225921631, 0.023407360538840294, 0.06351077556610107, 0.005804246757179499, 0.00033596312277950346, 0.19718961417675018]]}
