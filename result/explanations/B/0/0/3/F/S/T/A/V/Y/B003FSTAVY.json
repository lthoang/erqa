I was thoroughly satisfied with this product. It has great features; it pushes my 2 passive 12\"\" speakers. It has a lot of settings. Good automatic setting for different sources so that you don't have to change the way the sound setting for each source. The number of HDMI's are a plus, even though I don't know if I would need all of those inputs in the future. The sound is great. That being said, you will need to line up your sound settings for each source. I was suprised when I learned that my receiver's remote worked so easily with my TV. It is a seamless transition when I rerouted the remote to the TV.I just want to take some time out to for those who were like me who were and hesitated on buying this product in reading some of the reviews and comments:First I want to address Cnet review of this product. I thought from the get go that their review of this system was kind of unfair. They're comparing a entry - level system to a mid - level system. The truth of the matter is that there is no comparison for this system. At this price range there is no (yea I said it) other system like this system. This receiver gives you competitive 1000 dollar receiver quality for a fraction of the cost. No I don't work for Onkyo. But, I'm telling you the truth. Now, I'm not saying that this is the best system for people who needs a professional receiver or looking for a powerful receiver for a house that is located in a remote area with hardly no neighbors. No, this isn't the best receiver Onkyo has. But, the difference between the those receivers Cnet described is marginal at best. Yeah, you'll notice a different if you turn the thing up sky high, but the fact of the matter is, if you get some good speakers and some 12\"\" subs (right now I have a 10\"\" sub. I'm about to get that Polk 505 active 12\"\" sub soon and those Moniter 70s for my front bi- amping), you should be ok.I want to address another comments. Some say, this receiver is too complex to set-up. Listen I don't care who you are, if you want a 7.2 surround sound, then you will have to have a receiver that has versitility. Especially, if you hook your sound up with a digital signal. Because the problem with hdmi signals is that when a program come through, they have many sources. Those sources needs to be configured so that the sound won't be distored. To me, my PS3 was harder to set-up then this system. But, you do need to look up some things in the manual. This is a high quality product, so one should expect for there to be a few settings to configure.This system does has its problems. One of note that I have to agree with other reviewer, there is a passthrough issue with this system. There is a lot of \"\"noise\"\" and artifacts when letting the receiver process the video data. There is a secret trick to over coming this: just press the VCR button simutaniously with the RETURN button on the receiver. Then keep pressing the RETURN button to configure a hard pass through. Now don't be confused, there is a passthrough in the video settings as well, but that passthrough still allows some processing by the receiver. I thought that was kind of stupid to have that setting in there. I would've been frustrated if I didn't learn about this option on the this site in the comments. And, even with that Hard Passthrough setting there is some molestation with the video, but you won't notice it after a while. And, some people eyes aren't that sensitive.Another problem that one may want to watch for is that if you get \"\"fat finger\"\" with the on-board receiver's buttons, the HDMI signal will stop working for a while. This happened to me. I had to swap my first receiver with a new one from Amazon (their trade in service is pretty good) and get a new one, only to find that the next day it work perfectly. So, I would say be careful on how you press those buttons on the receiver. I would advise that one should use the remote after setting the hard passthrough on or off.But, overall, this system is a 5 star system easily. The quality of sound and the system's versitility and configurations allows you to hear a wide range of different sounds and sound quality. The remote feature and you get the most basic of settings or you can really get into the dts stuff. All this system needs are some good quality speakers and the sound differences between the upper echelon of onkyo and pioneer are marginal and won't mean too much especailly if you live in a residential area or an apartment.\"", "I can't really compare this to other types of receivers since this is my first one, but this receiver is great! There are so many different audio and video options you can use which is what I wanted.-Audio-The quality of the audio is just excellent; I got the Onkyo SKS-HT540 7.1 channel speaker set for Christmas and they sound great! I use my monitor and ps3 (hdmi), and ps2 (currently analog, waiting for my optical cable to arrive) with this receiver and all everything sounds awesome.  I'm also impressed about is the music mode. On the reviews of my speaker system, some people said that these don't sound good while listening to music, which I agree with. BUT, with this music mode turned on, the music sounds great. I had never heard music sound so good until I listened to it with this setting on.-Video-Ok so I was a little disappointed with the video quality. The video processor in this receiver is designed to upscale standard definition (480i/p) to hd (720/1080 i/p). If the video is already in HD, the video quality looks worse, which was a major disappointment for me. Luckily, you can turn this off but pressing the VCR/DVR button, then the RETURN button, which I recommend you turn it off when viewing something already in HD. One cool thing is you can input other types of video sources (component or composite) and output to the HDMI out port. This is very important to me because my Monitor (I use it for everything) only has one HDMI input and 1 DVI input.If you are looking for a receiver with a lot of features and won't kill your pocket, this is the one you should get.", "Onkyo's HT-RC260 presents an entry-level 3D-capable receiver. In order to be compliant with 3D your receiver needs to support HDMI 1.4 specifications and this Onkyo does just that, complete with a whopping FIVE HDMI inputs, pretty incredible for a sub-$500 receiver. The specs are listed here on Amazon, so there isn't much need to go through them, but moving from a 130w/ch TX-SR805 to testing this HT-RC260 for review I was still easily able to push my full range Paradigm speaker system to reference levels. I don't have a 3D TV so I don't need to use HDMI 1.4 yet. I will keep the TX-SR805 as my main receiver as Super Audio CD is important to me and I use DSD>Analog conversion using the PCM1796 DAC's found in the TX-SR805 running DSD directly from a Pioneer 48AV SACD/DVD-A player. The HT-RC260 will accept DSD natively over HDMI but I have confirmed with Onkyo's tech support than even in DSD DIRECT mode there is a PCM conversion, so if you're a DSD purist you'll either want to use analog connections or choose one of the higher end models from Onkyo that does allow for DSD>Analog conversion over HDMI without a PCM decimation.This receiver is listed as a 7.2 receiver and features the new Dolby Pro-Logic IIz featuring additional front height channels and the Audyssey DSX for calibrating your front height channels into your 5.1 system. The .2 on the 7.2 refers to the receiver having two powered subwoofer pre-outs instead of one, very handy for those not wanting to use a splitter on their LFE output. The system doesn't however output left and right subwoofer frequencies as at the frequencies your subs in a decent home system will be outputting you will not be able to tell directionality anway...and you don't want to be sending 150Hz frequencies to your sub to begin with unless you want it to start sounding like a crappy Bose Acoustimass system!One other point of interest is that your 7.2 receiver can be set to add either front height channels or additional surround back channels; all 7.1 encoded blu-ray discs have surround back channels encoded, not front height channels. So what are you using front height channels for? My guess is as good as yours. Sony's SDDS cinema systems featuring 7.1 audio also used front height channels instead of rear surround channels and they've been some of the best sonic experiences I've ever had in the cinema - hearing The Fifth Element in SDDS 7.1 is the #1 aural experience of my life in a cinema. Perhaps at some point we might see front height channels, but I'm not sure if that's even in the specifications at the moment with the current blu-ray disc set-up. I don't have an extra pair of speakers, so my testing was all done in a 5.1 configuration.One thing I really liked seeing on this receiver is that there are only four composite inputs, so the HDMI inputs outnumber the composite inputs. Hey, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!! Gosh, does anyone really need the 10 composite inputs you can find on some of the higher end receivers over the last two years like the Denon 5308CI? It's ridiculous. I can understand maybe you have one or two devices at the most, nice to see Onkyo catching on.The TX-SR608 which is $100 more (MSRP $499 vs MSRP $599) gets you THX Select 2 Plus certification which may provide for more consistent output with all-channels driven, something not many real world sources will require your receiver to do anyway, and also adds in a PC serial port (15-pin) which I've never used on any of my equipment, and is SIRIUS ready. If these features aren't for you then you can't go wrong with this Onkyo.Kudos to Onkyo again for offering up a fully featured 3D receiver at a price that should be attractive to anyone. 5 STARS based on performance and feature set vs. price.", "Love the Onkyo Home Theater Receiver. It's set-up is easy, fairly easy, I should say, I'm not techy. The sound is amazing and love having everything all working through one receiver. It's amazing that you can hook your PC, TV and stereo all up together. Now you can really watch movies over the internet with this receiver and your TV. Love it.", "I bought this because I needed more HDMI ports and wanted a more current receiver.  I'm very satisifed and it works great with my Blu-Ray and XBOX 360.", "As someone who started collecting vinyl LP records in the 1960s, then audiocassettes in the 70s and 80s, VHS tapes in the 80s, then CDs in the 90s, and DVDs in the 00's, I have a large amount of content in the various media. The hardware needed to play this media includes not only turntable, tape deck, VCR, CD and DVD player, and cable box, but a computer with a high end sound card that provides access to a gigantic high quality online music collection called Rhapsody, and two streaming video devices, namely a Roku and an internet capable Blu-Ray player.  Plus of course we have a television and about 8 speakers that we want to connect to the receiver.  We also have an electronic keyboard that we like to play through the receiver.What I like about the Onkyo is that for a modest price, it combines good sound quality with connectivity that allows me to hook all these devices together.  I am not sure whether the Onkyo has better or worse connectivity than other home theater receivers. I suspect it is among the better ones.NOTE TO MANUFACTURER: While the connectivity capability is very good, it requires quite a bit of thought to make use of it, and I think the manufacturer should include some online video tutorials in addition to the written material, that would present examples of how to connect various inputs and outputs. It might be useful to allow users to upload video footage showing their solutions to various situations, and for the manufacturer to index them, and weed out the weak ones.", "\"This is my first receiver, and I'm no expert, but I love this unit!  I was needing an upgrade of my simple \"\"home theater system\"\" (old CRT TV, VCR, DVD player), and the sound was what needed the most help, as my TV often wouldn't get loud enough.  Paired with a new set ofPolk Audio Monitor 30 2-Way Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black), this is amazing, and I can't wait to add to it to get an even better surround effect.  The unit was simple enough to plug everything into and configure.  Worked without any tweaking, but fiddling with the menus for a few minutes did help optimize settings (bi-amping my speakers, choosing theater-dimensional sound (\"\"surround sound\"\" with only 2 speakers), using the included microphone to balance sound output for my home's listening location, etc).  Radio signals are excellent with the included antennas (have only tried FM so far though).  Definitely expandable as I add more at home.  I'd suggest having an HDTV before getting this though: my TV doesn't have an HDMI input, and the graphical menu system only works through that (forunately, can also tweak everything using the front panel display).  The included remote almost works universally... controls the receiver, my TV, and VCR (after punching in a few codes), but doesn't work with my Apex DVD player, so I still need two remotes handy.Great item... seems very well-featured for the price, and well-built.  Not too hard to use (ever for a newbie).  Very happy with it.***EDIT: 21 November 2012. I've had the unit less than two and a half years. While it's been working fine, the receiver just failed on me. The warranty is only good for two years, and the best the company can do for me since I'm past that is offer a small trade-in discount for a newer model. What failed is that sound is no longer passed through the receiver via HDMI inputs. A quick google search reveals that this is a VERY common problem with Onkyo receivers, affecting nearly every model they make. The failure is in the HDMI board, due to poor engineering. Due to the apparent frequency of problems, I won't be recommending Onkyo receivers anymore, especially since they didn't offer any me useful service options, and don't seem to stand behind their products.\"", "I've had the past couple of days to enjoy my new receiver.  It's what anyone would expect from an Onkyo.  One item to note regarding the price is that the msrp is actually 499 and not 549, so that decreases the overall savings.  The price of 349 is still great for what you are getting.  The RC260 is essentially a slightly stripped down version of the SR608 offering from Onkyo.  It lacks three items, the VGA 15-pin input, Sirius input and THX Select2 certification.  For those that don't require those three features, you can save some money by opting for the RC260.Unfortunately this unit because it's based off the SR608, it also has the 1080p video degradation because of the video processor that is built into the unit.  This is used to perform up-conversion of your non 1080p sources.  You can turn it off if you choose to, but you would lose the on screen display which is very useful.  However, you can still configure everything through the one line display on the unit itself.There are a total of 6 HDMI inputs, so there are plenty and I don't know if I will ever be able to consume them all.  It helps to have it when you need it though.It's audio/video processing options galore.", "Right out of the box this appears to be a well-designed, quality receiver. It will work best if you have updated, state of the art equipment. Unfortunately, I don't so we ran into a few glitches. If all your equipment is already connected via hdmi, the hookup will be easy. Because we had older equipment without hdmi connections, we struggled and found some frustration.For example, believe it or not, we still have a turntable. Even stranger, we still occasionally use it. There is no phono hookup on this receiver. I had to email Onkyo and ask how to hook up an old school turntable. It took more than a week to receive a reply. Finally, I received an answer--and an apology for the delay--and was told I needed a phono pre-amp. That will cost an extra $20 or so.Another thing you need to be aware of is the IPOD dock is sold separately. It appears in the product specifications that it's ready to go, but that is not the case.All in all, it's a nice unit at a great price. Just be aware that if you have outdated equipment you're in for some frustration.", "\"The world of home theater has come a long way in the last few years.  It wasn't too long ago that $350 would get you only a bare-bones receiver.  Now it will get you a unit that will cover most needs of a medium-sized setup.Your basic 5.1 is easily covered, as long as you have a powered subwoofer.  After that, there are two additional channels that may be put to work either as additional surrounds (your typical 7.1 configuration) or as height channels (new, but gaining popularity).  You can actually even have both: additional surrounds AND height, but you'll have to come up with another two channels of amplification for that.  All popular decoders are covered--the many flavors of Dolby and DTS--as well as a few additional modes that are unique to Onkyo.  These decoders are implemented well.I was also impressed with the 6 HDMI 1.4a inputs.  Onkyo is ahead of the curve on this, since most devices out there still are only 1.3.  The RC260 supports these older implementations well and provides support for 3D and for the interesting Audio Return Channel when it becomes more widely supported.  The inputs are all easily nameable for what you really have connected.  One important feature is that each input is configurable.  If the incoming audio is DTS, for example, the receiver will support it by default.  But in many cases, it may be only stereo.  What does it do then?  You can select the default decoder for that case, for each input individually.  So perhaps you'll set your cable input to use Prologic Theater, and your CD input to a music mode.  At the same time, you can elect to pass the video through unaffected, or to apply sharpening or upconversion. This is a very nice feature.Room calibration is an important feature that's not always understood by the innocent consumer.  Real rooms have all sorts of problems.  The placement of your seat, the relation between speakers and walls, and the size and shape of the room can make a good system sound bad.  A good receiver will have a way of compensating for this by measuring the room and the applying EQ (fancy term for tone controls) that corrects the problem.  Onkyo has done a very good job with this.  Simply place the provided microphone right about where your head would be and then plug it in to the front of the unit.  The onscreen display will automatically walk you through the process.  It only takes a few minutes, and the difference in sound is really striking.  I've dealt with this process with many different pieces of equipment, and I think Onkyo does as good a job of making it simple as can be done.The remote is a fairly typical programmable remote. You can provide codes (Onkyo walks you through suggested codes) to control most of the other devices in your system.  As you might expect this sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  It controls my Toshiba HD-DVD (yes, I actually have one) perfectly well, but is a few buttons short of controlling my satellite box.  On the other hand, I was able to program my DirectTV remote to control the mute and volume of the Onkyo, so most of my bases are covered.  Be prepared to spend an evening with a lapful of remotes, seeing what you can do.The manual is fair, but not outstanding.  There are a lot of undefined terms that only have meaning to experienced audio/video people.  And there are others that even I--with decades in the field--scratch my head over.  This raises an important issue.  It's easy to find complaints about the complexity of a unit like this.  That's true--there are features in here that were only recently restricted to professionally-installed systems.  Any person who's not confident about their knowledge would be advised to get schooled.  There must be \"\"Home Theater for Dummies\"\" or something like it.  Once you understand how this unit works, you will be quite happy with it.  A few nights of setting it up, and it will easily support whatever you throw at it.IMPORTANT UPDATE:  There appears to be a flaw in this product.  After a few weeks of operation, the 5 HDMI inputs on the rear of the unit failed suddenly.  The only video signal coming out was a blue screen.  The auxiliary HDMI on the front continued to work.  Amazon replaced the unit.  After a couple of months, this second unit has just failed in the same way.  It's clear there's some sort of problem--either a bad lot of parts or a design flaw.  I'll report back to this review when and if I get an answer directly from Onkyo.  I really like the sound and functionality of the unit, but I'm afraid that I must knock off a few stars until there's a satisfactory resolution.CLOSURE: After another couple of months, the HDMI board failed completely.  It was replaced under warranty, and has performed quite well since that time.  It appears that there was either a faulty lot of boards or the design has been corrected.  I'm happy with the warranty service and I'm happy with the receiver.\"", "I was pleased to get a chance to review this product as I already have an Onkyo receiver to compare this to.My other receiver is a Onkyo TX-SR705. I paid significantly more for it. When I look down the amplifier spec sheets they look almost identical. To look at the units they look almost identical with the 260 being 2 inches shallower. To me connectivity is now more about HDMI with the others being secondary. The 705 has 3 rear HDMI 1.3 inputs and 1 output and this was limiting me. The 260 has 5 rear and 1 front HDMI 1.4a inputs and 1 output which allows me to hook up everything I want at this time with 1 extra rear port. I have a PS3, XBOX360, PC, and Scientific Atlanta HD3800 cable box connected to the rear HDMI ports. The front HDMI input is really convenient allowing my wife to quickly connect her Kodak Playsport and play or review videos before messing with them on her PC. As far as the other ports the 260 has one less coax digital and component inputs, lacks the multi-channel inputs and surround pre-outs, and is totally missing any S-Video or phono connections. None of those missing ports are a problem for me.I run my system with a 5.1 speaker setup from Aperion Audio. Hooking everything up was a snap. I use banana plugs on my speaker wire so it was literally plug and play to replace my old receiver. Once everything was connected I turned the system on and made sure it seemed to be working. I turned it onto a TV channel with DD sound and let it run for a few hours without adjusting anything. Once I was satisfied that it seemed to be working properly I connected the Audyssey mic and ran the setup. The mic setup was painless using 3 test points and was over quickly. My 705 has Audyssey MultiEQ XT and it took forever to run through the complete setup so I was happy with the quicker setup but wondered how it would sound because it used fewer test points. Well I don't consider myself an audiophile but I can hear the difference in a DD vs DTS vs the new HD audio codecs and to me this new receiver sounds better than my slightly older and more expensive unit. I think dialog from the center and the sub sounds better on the new unit. I would recommend that you do the quick and dirty setup like I did with the mic and then spend some time and sit down with the manual and see if there is anything you want to change. Sitting there with the book to guide you through the menus will help you understand the settings and what your options are.As far as the whole video processing thing goes I don't see a degradation like some people say they see. I am using a Sony Bravia 60hz LCD TV with the receiver and I haven't noticed anything so far in the few weeks that I have been using the unit. Maybe 120Hz and up TV users experience it and 60Hz doesn't; I'm not sure but it looks OK to me and I haven't noticed anything strange. I set all the game consoles to through with game mode enabled and the cable box to custom which I think was the default.The remote is OK you just have to keep in mind that this is considered an entry level unit so taking that into account it is pretty good. It runs my TV and cable box lacking only a button or two. Setup was really easy, they actually put the codes in the receiver and tell you how to program it through the receivers on screen display, I thought that was pretty cool. It only uses codes and does not learn like the remote with my 705 does. It also lacks button illumination like the 705 remote had but I never used that anyway. I like the direction pad on the 260 remote over the joystick on the 705 remote.One thing that I wish was improved with both units is some way to easily upgrade the firmware. With things as complicated as these are sometimes problems get through and sometimes they could be corrected with a firmware update. This receiver lacks a USB port that could be used to easily upgrade the firmware. I am not sure if upgrading the firmware is possible with this unit but with the 705 I had there was a problem with certain DTS HD audio tracks. You could get a firmware updatee by sending or taking the unit to an authorized dealer. I don't have any of those around here so I got the firmware from a forum and had to burn it to a audio cd and set my PS3 to play it a certain way to a certain optical port after pressing certain buttons on the receiver and then hoping it worked. Well it worked but it was pretty crazy making it all happen. It could have all been avoided with a simple USB port and updates released via the Onkyo website.Overall I think that this is a great unit for the price and am impressed with how they have moved features and improvements down the line.", "\"This is my third receiver in 5 years.  My previous two were Yamaha receivers, one at about this price point and one about $200 more.  They will be my basis for comparison.PROSThe HUGE selling point to me on this receiver is the number of HDMI inputs and all of them are assignable through an on screen interface (as are the other inputs).  My 50\"\" Sony 1080p TV only had two HDMI inputs and I was having to use component input + optical audio for one of my devices.  Moving to this receiver now allows all of them to go through HDMI to the receiver and then a single HDMI to the TV, leaving one HDMI open on the TV. This also helped to clean up my mess of cables.I think the overall sound quality is very good from this device.  I have been very happy with the sound quality.The device is very slick looking. It is smaller than my Yamahas. It is also reasonably easy to use for everyday use once setup.I don't have a 3D TV, but apparently it requires the newer HDMI version which this receiver CAN handle.CONSThe real downside I've had with the device is that it has taken me quite a bit of tinkering to take care of a few issues.  This may be somewhat to be expected for a device with so many options, but it is the things that I've had to mess with that bother me:I don't know what I need to do to change it, but right now whenever the sound input type (Dolby Digital vs Dolby Stereo, etc) changes the receiver does a small clicking and the sound goes silent for a tiny little instant (maybe half a second).  It happens sometimes as I change channels and often happens if the show I'm watching goes to commercial and then again when it comes back from commercial.  My Yamahas did this when I changed input selection (switch from cable box to Blu Ray), but they didn't do it as often as this device.The video quality got worse when going through the device.  I had to figure out how to disable video processing and just let the signal pass through, because although this device has upconversion built-in, I saw a noticeable degradation in picture quality than when going straight from my devices to the TV. I'll assume this is due to my TV having a much better video signal processor than the A/V receiver. At any rate, you have to hold the VCR button and press the return button (both on the front of the receiver) a few times to toggle it off. Even now, I sometimes feel like things don't look as good as they used to when I had HDMI going straight to the TV.Secondly, the sync between sound and the lips on the TVs was very bad and I had to mess with the A/V sync to get it to be more acceptable.  I thought this was a little annoying since audio and video all travel on the same wire (HDMI).CONCLUSION:I know the CONS section looks big, but really this is a very good receiver. The sound quality is very good. My three year old Yamaha that cost closer to $600 seemed to have similar sound quality, but didn't have all the HDMI ports as this receiver. I just wish they wouldn't have thrown it what seems to be a pretty bad video processor. The bonus features like an iPod port / HD Radio connector are really nice. If I were in the market I would definitely consider this receiver as a very strong contender in this price range.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.01012642215937376, 0.004007631912827492, 0.0056052845902740955, 0.007742961402982473, 0.010489316657185555, 0.00048463288112543523, 0.00047729091602377594, 0.006085523404181004, 0.07377582043409348, 0.004128836560994387, 0.011556551791727543, 0.8655197620391846]]}
