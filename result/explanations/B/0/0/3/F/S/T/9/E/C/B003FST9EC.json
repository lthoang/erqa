All but the TV are enclosed in a cabinet with glass doors.  The 2 devices on the bottom shelf don't respond to remote commands as well as I'd like, causing me to have to point the remote at just the right angle for them to respond reliably.Using this IR extender caused the device that gave me the most trouble (my xbox) to respond to remote commands very well, but caused my Directv receiver (which had previously given me no trouble) to pretty much not work at all.I still give this 3 stars as I can imagine that if you have a set up with components in isolated cabinets things would work very well.  Just a caution that if the components can receive any signal from the remote directly, this IR Blaster system will not work well.", "\"The Logitech Harmony IR Extender System is great!  The only thing that I can add to the discussion is that the placement of the sensors (\"\"blasters\"\") is the key to effective use of the system.  They need to be well in front of the IR sensor of the device you wish to control.  If the sensor is too close then the IR sensor of the device (say your TV) will not pick up the relayed IR sensor.  I had to place the main blaster that I use to controlling my TV about 12 inches in front of the TV.  If it is too close or under the sensor I found that in my case it would not work well.  I like the extra length of the wires provided on the system - particularly for a spread out multimedia system.  It is nice to know that I can aim at one spot and now control everything in the room.  I give this system 5 stars.\"", "Product is attractive, and simple.  The main blaster unit appears to all I need to control 5 devices in a large cabinet, but having two additional blasters to plug in is a nice feature.  The long cable on the receiver sensor and the small plug on the end made is simple to drill some holes and string the cable unobtrusively.  One negative that isn't advertised with this unit, but is a major issue with other product's advertising and reviews is its sensitivity to plasma tv light interference.  The signal light goes crazy when the receiver sits 10&#34; below a wall mounted TV, and it takes multiple pushes of a remote button to get a good signal through.  Ended up mounting the receiver 12&#34; to the left of the plasma with a bookshelf wall protecting it from most of the noise (the IR sensor for the tv is on it's left, so this gives you one general area to aim to control all devices).", "I purchased this unit to extend the reach of my Logitech Harmony One Universal Remote Control, after unpacking the unit and making the required connections, I found it absolutely useless and has no value, it never work and never extend anything, it keeps blinking all the time even without using my remote controlI will make one phone call to Logitech support before getting rid of this garbage", "I bought one and love it! works very well, perfect for inside cabinets with multiple devices. Easy to use. After Logitech stopped selling them I hunted for three months to buy another for my father-in-law because his Radio Shack version is pure crap. If you can find one, buy it - you won't be disappointed.", "I have a couple of these and they work great for everything I have for them. I have about 8 devices behind closed doors on one and don't need multiple relays for each device like other systems. I have one relay in each &#34;space&#34; of the cabinet and the main receiver discreetly mounted to the top of my TV so it looks like a webcam. I have about 2-3 devices on each shelf and only 1 of the relays hooked up. I can use my regular remotes and all the basic functions from anywhere in my great room (56' long x 32' wide) and don't have any issues.", "Happy to say this is one the few products I've gotten that works EXACTLY as advertised !!You can set all of your components in closet or closed cabinet and still use with a universal remoteWe use the harmony1 remote, which is infra redThis is aHARDWIRED solution so you will have to keep ALL components in same roomIt does not convert the iR signal to RFSimple, quick, efficient and looks nice as wellinstalls in less than 10 minutes (after I put all components into a closet)Cord is thin and easy to 'hide' on baseboards or wherever works for youVERY HAPPY with this .........and it keeps away dust and kids spilling food/drink etc on themONLY POSSIBLE drawback is the wire to main receiver could be a foot or so longerIt is only around 9 ft", "This extender performed flawlessly once I found a configuration that worked without interference at the receiver end. Apparently, it is very sensitive to outside light (or something). The last thing I did was cover the receiver with a piece of black window screen, which so far, works. It took a lot of hours of frustrating troublshooting to find a configuration that worked. And that's the reason for the 4-star rating. If the screen modification fails, I'll update this review.", "I'm in the process of re configuring our living room and the home theater setup.  This will involve moving the receiver and other equipment into an adjacent room on the other side of the wall so my Logitech Harmony remote will no longer work so I bought this blaster.I just set it up this evening and it took all of about 2 minutes to have it working perfectly.  Basically I was able to place the receiver on top of the TV and the main blaster box in the AV cabinet.  Using no other boxes I can control all of my components just as if they were in the line of sight, perfect!  I'm currently controlling a Panasonic Blu-Ray player, a Roku box, Monoprice HDMI switch, Yamaha receiver and an old Radio Shack VCR.", "*Please rate this review if you find it helpful***Update: March 9th, 2013**I have had this unit for about a year now and it still works flawlessly!**Original Review:  May 11th, 2012**Why did i purchase?/What was i looking for?:In my home theatre, i wanted to hide all of my components (receiver, apple tv, xbox, cabe box, and blu ray players) out of sight to give my room a more stream lined look.  I looked around amazon and i wasn't really cable to find anything that looked promising.  I stumbled across this unit and decided to give it a try.In the package:1-AC Power Brick1-IR Receiver1-Hub with built in blaster (Where you connect all of the wires)2-IR Blasters (emit/repeat the IR signal)Setup:Setup is ridiculously easy! All that you have to do with plug the AC power into the wall and then attach the IR Blasters so that a signal can reach each component.  After that, attach the IR Receiver to a point that is visible to your remote (under your TV or on the ceiling) and then you're all set!  There is no programming required because this unit simply transfer IR signals.Impressions:I honestly was shocked on how easy this was to setup.  I don't even have to aim my remote at the IR Receiver for it to pick up the signal and transmit it to my devices.  As for worrying about these units being too large, the only component that you will see (the IR RECEIVER), it is about the size of two playing die.  I have asked a few friends and none of them have noticed the tiny box above my tv.  As for the time delay between direct IR signals to my devices and transmitting the signal through this system, the delay is negligible.  The only time i ever noticed a SMALL delay is occasionally when i scroll through my cable guide at high speeds.What remotes will work with this unit?:I want to clear something up, THIS UNIT IS **NOT** SOLELY DESIGNED FOR LOGITECH REMOTES!  My logitech harmony one remote broke and i replaced it with a URC-MX-450 and this IR system still works flawlessly.  So far, i have not encountered any remotes that are not compatible with this IR system.Overall:This is a must have unit for anyone.  Your wife will no longer complain about a 100 boxes crowding your tv area.  It works wonderfully and i will try to keep this for a long time!", "Have tried the cheaper kits...didn't work Well.This unit seems to work well.Giving it only 4 stars because:  #1 - Range from remote to the reciever could be longer  #2 - Price is a little high.", "This Logitech IR Extender system is pretty much a must-have for anyone who keeps their entertainment center components behind a cabinet.  It is easy to set up (though you may have to experiment slightly with the blaster locations).  Once properly set-up, it works exactly as described.  The only negative is that it's slightly more expensive than other IR blasters available (and you don't have to use a Harmony system with a Harmony remote).  Logitech is known to have excellent customer service, so it might be worth paying a little more to get this system.", "\"PROS:Sleek, non-RF solution (when compared to terk and similar products), reasonably good sensitivity, works very consistently (no dropped presses)CONS:Tends to become \"\"weaker\"\" as more mini-blasters are connected. Have to work a little for optimal placement of the receiverDetails:I have a projector screen that blocks the view to my blu-ray player and home theater receiver. I initially tried the TERK solution and had 2 issues with it. One was that it was spotty (and sometimes required a reset) and that it had to emit RF signals (which do make sense when you have to control equipment in another room).This solution on paper looked very good and coming from logitech increased my confidence quotient. When I initially installed it, I put it on the ground (on top of the box it came in to give it some elevation). It seemed to work reasonably well from different angles. I then added the first mini-blaster to operate my receiver and then I noticed that I strictly had to be facing my remote towards the logitech receiver.Subsequently, I moved the receiver on top of my projector screen (i had it tilted towards where my couch was). All of a sudden, I could hit my home theater receiver from almost any angle. It was amazing really. I now added the second mini-blaster to the unit and lost my angle significantly (not to a point where I was annoyed though). I now had to face the remote slightly up (not exactly pointing the IR receiver) and the side angles were mostly gone. Remove the third mini-blaster and the angles came back again. I am not really sure that this is a problem but is definitely not documented in any of their manuals.During the final install (concealing the IR receiver wire), I figured that the 8ft wire was not going to work. I got a 6ft stereo cable extension for about 5 bucks and it worked perfectly fine (logitech did mention this in their FAQ).In summary, if you take the time to test the position of your IR receiver (with all the mini-blasters connected), you will most probably not be disappointed.PS: Some basic rules still apply. Direct line-of-sight and blaster dont work. Make sure that you can fully conceal the receiving units from direct line of sight from the remote. Do not place the blasters so that they transmit to the same unit etc.\"", "After a meltdown of my entertainment system I am rebuilding it component by component.  A new DVR, A new sound system, CD/DVR . . . and a new remote extender.The components are in a closet roughly 12' feet away from the TV screen.  The cabling runs through the back of the shelving on the wall with the TV, then into the closet where the DVD/DVR et al are located.My former remote extender had a few problems that became more pronounced with the new components.  So it was replaced by the Logitech extender.At first it seemed like the new extender worked well.  But I noticed as I gave more commands, it seemed to become less reliable.  Mute would work at first, but after two or three cycles it wouldn't.  Ditto for channel changes: work for awhile, then fail.  Often one or more of the components would not turn off.I had selected the Logitech unit in part because I had a Logitech universal remote (Harmony 670).  The thought was they would work and play well together.That is now correct but it took a lot of testing, time on the telephone, chat sessions and emails to sort things out.___________________________________________________Update:  February 27, 2012The IR extender works!  It works very well.  This is why I am now a fan:The extender has three transmitters.  Two are called MiniBlaster.  The other is called Blaster.  The Blaster is a transmitter as well as a connection for the two MiniBlasters.  My components are in a closet, about 12 feet from the TV screen.  The cable from the IR receiver was not long enough to reach the closet so I used the two MiniBlasters in the closet.  One was placed just a few inches in front of the DVR and the Bose Media Center.The ability to control the system was very marginal.  After lengthy discussions with Logitech and Bose, it was finally determined that the Blaster (outside the closet) was a likely source of interference with the MiniBlasters within the closet.  I wrapped the Blaster in aluminum foil (to minimize its radiation) and the problems disappeared.  Apparently the Blaster and the MiniBlasters were cancelling each other on a random basis.Summary:  The IR extender works well . . . once you sort out potential interference problems.(And, while the new Logitech Harmony H1100 was probably not needed, it is really a slick device and we decided to keep it.)", "\"I have a flat panel LCD monitor on my mantel, along with some small speakers and an Apple TV.  To keep the mantel from looking cluttered, the rest of my system, including a TiVO HD and a disc player, are located in a small side table in a corner of my room, out of sight, and connected by a concealed 25' run of HDMI cable.  While this system looks great, the problem was that remote control of these far-removed boxes was kind of dodgy - some signals would bounce in correctly, many would be lost.The Logitech remote extender was trivially easy to install.  Plugged one end of the AC adapter into the power squid and other into the main \"\"blaster\"\" unit.  I put the blaster on top of the stacked disc player and Tivo, on the hidden shelf, and put the tiny IR receiver on top of the side table, where it's so unobtrusive you can hardly notice it.  Hey presto, everything works perfectly.  The receiver is so sensitive it detects the remote control from any place in the room, pointing in any direction.  And the blaster is (so far) perfectly responsive and reliable, with no signs (so far) of signal delay, interference or incompatibility.  This was worth its price twice over.\"", "\"\"\"Installation\"\" couldn't have been easier.  Had in working in a few minutes.  Does what it's supposed to do with no troubles.  Highly recommended, even for the techno-phobe.\"", "I am using this IR extender with various remotes and am very happy with the performance.  But my road to satisfaction had a bump I can help you avoid.  I, like most folks, like to test things out to see if they work before I invest much time in installation.  Installation is minimal in this case, just running some wires and making room to plug the device in on a pretty full UPS, but I wanted to test it out none the less.  So I plugged everything in, moved the receiver around the corner, pointed the stylish blaster at the devices (an ATT Uverse box, TV and DVD player) and .... nothing happened.  Added a mini blaster and ... I got very erratic transmission.  Moved them closer, farther away ... still awful performance.  I could see the lights responding on the blaster.  I read the instructions again, which are very brief because the product is so simple, and still could not figure it out.So, I called Logitech support, got escalated a level and then got an answer to my blunder.  I am now appropriately humbled.  I was pointing the shinny rounded edge toward the electronics.  It is the side with the wires coming out that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the devices to be controlled.  It makes total sense for when you install the blasters.  They were designed to sit on a shelf slightly in front of any equipment with their wires extending toward the back of the shelf.  But, when I was testing from in front of the equipment, I did not think to turn the blaster around so the side with all of the wires attached was pointing at the electronics.Once over this bump in the road I created, the product worked well with all of my remotes.  Of note, the IR receiver - the only part that sits out in the open - has a cord that is 8 feet in length and ends in what looks just like a 3.5mm audio jack.  That should cover most applications.  However, if additional length is needed, a headphone cord extender would fit - I just do not know of the signal would travel the additional length.", "\"TheLogitech Harmony IR Extender Systemis a good product that falls short of being a great product.  If you have a Harmony remote without radio frequency (RF) capability, you are likely familiar with the frustration of having your devices not respond sometimes.  Without a clear line of sight, your IR remote is just not going to work.  But this system attempts to tackle that challenge by allowing you to extend your IR signal to mini-blasters.  This works great for certain setups and not so great for others.  My main warning about this product is that you have to do a lot of trial and error before you find out how to set this up for yourself.  But as long as you know what you are getting into, this will work for a lot of setups.  It's also significantly cheaper than buying the top of the line RF remote, and for whatever reason some of the better remotes are only sold in IR models.This device is ideal for setups that involve controlling devices hidden from view in a cabinet.  While in theory it should allow you to extend the range from which you can control devices, in practical terms it doesn't work too well for trying to use your remote across a greater distance.PROS:++ The receiver, blaster and mini-blasters are sized right and work well when properly installed++ Cables are long enough to be used in larger entertainment centers and home theatres++ The units are attractive and moderately sized++ Works well with IR Harmony remotes++ Affordable relative to the cost of upgrading to an RF remoteCONS:-- Setup requires trial and error and must be tailored to your media center-- Devices that are not hidden or too close can suffer interference-- Troubleshooting can be time-consuming and is not well documented-- A limited number of blasters can be setup, meaning you can only have so many groups of devices-- Cables can create clutter when your entertainment center has no space for hiding themINSTALLATION AND SET UPSetup takes some time, though the actual installation isn't really complex.  There is a hidden element of planning and placement in order for this system to function and look nice at the same time.  The main receiver should be placed in a central location.  Then you can deploy the mini blasters for the hidden devices in your setup.  There are some challenges to confront in the install.1. The receiver has to be in a good central location for this to work.2. The blasters can't be too close to each other.  If each device is in an enclosed cabinet area, you will need a blaster for each one.  If you have 3 or 4 devices within one cabinet, you should only use 1 mini-blaster.3. The cables have to be routed and hidden to limit the clutter to your setup.  All of these cables really made me want to just bite the bullet and buy an RF remote.  But my IR remote has features that are expensive to find in RF remotes.The location of the blasters is the biggest challenge.  It only took about 40 minutes for me to setup the system to work with my media player, AV receiver, TV, and sound equipment.  But troubleshooting can take hours if you have blasters too close together or too far from your devices.  The trial an error aspect of this product is not well documented for all setups.FEATURESThis system does what it's supposed to.  It allows you to operate the devices you have hidden from view, and thus hidden from your IR signal.  It would have been great if extenders were provided to allow you to increase the range.  This was not a deal breaker, more like a \"\"nice to have.\"\"CONCLUSIONOnce it is setup this works like a charm.  You don't really have to do anything in terms of maintenance.  But placing the units in the right place and setting them up right takes some time.  The blasters themselves are nice and small, but all the wires can get messy.  If you pay a lot of attention to detail, be prepared to spend an afternoon toying with this.Only time will tell how durable this system is.  So far I am satisfied with it.  I recommend it with the reservations about installation.Enjoy.\"", "For those looking to hide away components this is a great device. It works exactly as it should, repeating IR signals from a receiver to several transmitters that can be placed near stored equipment. The design is sleek and unobtrusive. It does what its supposed to and looks nice as well, overall a great product.", "I've had these in use with my Harmony 900 remote for quite a while, so it's nice to see this released as a stand alone product. I hadn't put two and two together to realize that this product works with the Harmony 700 and Harmony One as well. Since I have the Harmony One as my bedroom remote, it's nice to have this add on. I went ahead and drilled holes in the back of my dresser drawers and put the cable box, DVD player, and receiver in there, and now the IR receiver grabs the signal and transmits it to the hidden component. No more components on top of the dresser!", "I bought this because I have a glass cabinet and sometimes the receiver and cable box don't catch the ir signal.  It works pretty good, I also have a boxes box and ir receiver didn't work very well with that but for the receiver and tivo worked wonders, can't point the remote in pretty much any direction now and it still works.Good product overall", "This system works very well for an IR repeater.  You just have to make sure that this will work for your setup.If you have a cabnet with your components in it that is under or beside the TV then this will work for you.  It does exactly what it says, you point at the TV it relays the signal to the components.  It works well too, I notice no interuption in signal at all.If you have your components in another room or behind the viewer, then it is just simply not the best option.  If this is your setup just get an RF remote, which will send a signal through any wall, in any direction to your components.The installation took less than an hour, it was pretty simple.", "It works pretty well when the conditions are right.  I had a Harmony 550, the Playstation 3 module and a 3D TV.  During the day when the sunlight would shine in the room the bluetooth performance would suffer.  Its like the extender would send commands to the Playstation module and cause a delay in the controller.  This would also prevent any changes from being made when the TV was in 3D mode.", "\"When I purchased a new TV and a large furniture-like stand with doors that covered all of my audio and video equipment, I thought I had finally and efficiently solved my equipment clutter problem. Everything was now out of sight, but I had to aim the remote just right in order to operate anything! Enter Logitech to save the day. I put the receiving unit on top of the TV (it measures 3/4\"\" high, 1-7/8\"\" wide, and 1\"\" deep) where it fits very discretely, like the third brake light at the top of a car's rear window. Now, the tricky part... does it work? The answer is a resounding yes. I am now back to lazily pointing the remote in the direction of the TV and Logitech does the rest. The most difficult part of the job was fishing the wires through the mass of other cables at the back of my system. There are two wires that must be fished. One is the power source for the unit, the other is for the receiving unit. The main module operates as both the power supply for the system, as well as the main signal relay unit (blaster). There are two other remote blasters (relay units) which, if used, would also require connection to the main power supply/blaster. I have an amp and a BD player on two different shelves in the center section of my TV cabinet, and only need the main blaster unit to operate them. I have found this extender system to work as well as advertised, and recommend it for situations where the amps, DVD players, CD changers, etc. are inconveniently located or are behind closed doors.\"", "\"It's called an \"\"extender\"\" but really it should be called a \"\"hider,\"\" or a \"\"now I can stick all those gadgets in a cabinet\"\" gadget.  That's what it's designed for - not to extend the reach of your remotes.  That said, this, er, extender is easy to use.By now you know it includes the receiver, a blaster and two \"\"mini-blasters\"\" (I can't help but picture that tiny guy from ThunderDome - the grubby guy riding the Master Blaster around.) There's no rule stating you have to use the mini-blasters.To simplify setup - if you have one shelf with multiple components (stacked or side-by-side) you only need the blaster.  If you have multiple shelves and there is a gap between the shelves that light can pass through, you probably only need the blaster.  If the shelves pretty much touch the doors when closed, then you probably need the blaster on one shelf, and a mini blaster on the other shelves.Each blaster shoots the IR signal left, right and up.  Putting the blaster on the bottom shelf MAY control the units two shelves higher IF the light can reach them.So - start with JUST the blaster on the bottom shelf, center. Close the doors.  Test all the components (of course your remote has to already be tested and working!)The components on the top shelf not working? Add a mini-blaster to the top shelf.  Make sure to point it in the correct direction.  Do the same for each shelf.If you start experiencing interference / erratic behavior, remove he mini-blaster you just added and move the other blaster around a bit - it may actually reach the components with a little repositioning.If you do have a gap between the doors and shelves, you can add a strip of aluminum, glossy white plastic, mirror, etc. to the edges of the cabinet interior to bounce the signal up.  This often helps with an IR signal and eliminates the need for another emitter.I wound up with the main blaster on the bottom shelf and mounted a mini-blaster to the inside of a door pointing up for the top two shelves. My cabinet is narrow and tall and has 4 shelves.  The main blaster handles the bottom two shelves, and the one mini-blaster handles the rest. The 2nd mini blaster is still in the box and will see use if I add another cabinet.If you use an old dresser, then you'd put the main blaster in one drawer, and a mini-blaster in each of the other drawers. This would then cover three drawers.\"", "This unit does not work from room to room. You put the receiver on top of the cabinet or piece of furniture and then run the IR blasters inside the cabinet. It also needs AC power to function. This is very nice for hiding your components. It has plenty of IR blasters to be able to control multiple components. I did have problems with my DIRECTV DVRs getting repeated signals and double commands.  I don't know if this is a problem with all DIRECTV setups or just mine. I wasn't able to get it working.", "\"This IR extender works great for controlling components that are behind cabinet doors or around corners. I tried this on a wall mounted TV, the cable box for which was around a corner on top of a bookshelf. Setup was easy, connecting the IR receiver to one of the mini blasters. In about 30 minutes it was up and running.Setup instructions are clear: simple drawings/diagrams are accompanied by basic written instructions. For those looking for a cosmetic solution to keeping you electronic components (DVD players, tuners, cable/TiVo/DVR boxes) out of sight but still controllable with their remotes, this IR extender should meet that need.Note that it only comes with a total of three \"\"blasters\"\" (one large and two small) but that should be more than enough to control multiple components in different areas, as long as the components are positioned relatively close to each other.\"", "\"This is just an IR extender, and doesn't have to be used with Harmony remotes.I don't have a Harmony, but it works just fine.I got it to be able to change the volume of my amplifier while in a different room in the house.

I have the IR receiver in the living room, and it repeats the signal in my cabinet for the amplifier.Simple.I'd give it 5 stars if it also worked with a battery. It has to be plugged in, and has yet another \"\"wall wort\"\" transformer to deal with.\"", "\"Installed in minutes and works great.
