"], "reviews": ["This box included a variety of snacks...pretzels, cookies, turkey sticks, mixed nuts, and sausage bites. All of them tasted good and seemed to be high quality. The only thing against it is that while all the food was good, none of it would make a good meal. If you are want to provide a friend or college student with an actual meal, this is not what you are looking for. All the things in it would be good for a side dish, or for a snack.", "My third child is in college, so for the third time we receive set of solicitations in the mail for final-exam-season care packages that we receive! Well, they always seem lacking in nutrition and very high price! Now this option allows me to send better quality food--protein, multi grain, dried fruit, nuts, see the list of foods--to my son, without paying the high prices or going through complicated ordering process. A great idea if you have college kids! I know my son's schedule can be so crazy right now and that he will appreciate the snacks!", "I think the key of this product is that it's a **care package**. This mix of products would be a fantastic surprise for a college student, or anyone, really. My favorite item was the pretzel crisps. Totally yummy!! The cookies & cashew crunch were pretty tasty. My daughter to the picnic meal on a school trip. She liked the turkey stick, but did not care for the fruit & nut mix and said the chocolate was too dark (bitter). No one in our house liked the cheese straws. The little beef thingies were pretty tasty.So, overall, I feel the product is over-packaged & over-priced for your regular, every-day snacking. I do think it would be a terrific gift. And it is a nice way to try some new products.", "I took this on a picnic with some friends and it was a hit.  All the items are nicely packaged, very tasty, and there is plenty of variety.  I think this product is well thought out, makes for a great care package, or just to have for snacks on a summer day with the family.", "This pack comes with delightful and tasty snacks, with a great variety. It includes carbs (pretzels and cookies), protein (beef sausage, turkey, and nuts), and dairy (cheese sticks). The set comes with one pack of each (except for cookies - you get two of those) so it's plenty of food for a picnic. I tried all of the snacks, and the only one I didn't care much for was the cheese sticks. They tasted like very light cookies with only a hint of cheese. I would have preferred real cheese sticks. Still, I think overall this is a great care package.", "With ten different foods, this picnic package contains both hits and misses.  I'm rating each item individually below.Aged Cheddar Cheese Straws, 5/5:  This was by far the best item in the box, and luckily it was also one of the biggest.  They are much more cheese than cracker, with cheddar cheese as the primary ingredient.  There is a bit of an edge to them, just like one would expect with decent aged cheddar.  The addition of pepper and paprika amplifies the bite and makes them perfect.  I loved them!Pretzel Crisps, 3/5:  These very flat pretzel crisps are perfect for dipping or holding pieces of cheese or other goodies.  Unfortunately, mine tasted very stale and weren't quite as crisp as I'd like in a pretzel.Cashew Crunch, 4/5:  I enjoyed these little cashew clusters, which were mixed up with a little sugar, salt, and sesame seeds.  They were maybe just a little plain for my tastes, but I always like a snack with some protein and iron in it.Sausage Bits, 2/5:  These miniature bits of beef sausage tasted great, but they didn't sit well with me.  I ended up with quite and upset stomach after eating just a few of them.Boxed Meal, 3/5:  The ready to eat meal contained a turkey stick, piece of chocolate, apricots pieces, barbecue potato chips, and a mix of almonds, cranberries and peanuts.  The turkey stick and barbecue potato chips weren't that great, but the chocolate, fruit, and nuts were all just fine.Chocolate Chip Cookies, 2/5:  How could they make chocolate chip cookies taste bad?  Apparently adding barley does the trick.  I enjoy barley in soups and casseroles, but it really doesn't belong in cookies.  I'll be sticking to the traditional wheat flour in my cookies in the future, since these cookies were the most disappointing item in the whole picnic package.", "This was a box full of the sort of treats to keep someone like a college freshman rolling during an establishment of dorm space, while providing them with enough to share with a roommate.There was a balanced mix of treats in this box: pretzel thins, cashew crunch, beef salami bites, little chocolate-chip cookies and other noshings that someone could easily work out of while figuring out where furnishings and accessories belonged in a new environment. Good, also, for exam time, when a plethora of treats would be welcome to see someone through drumming up a paper or cramming for a test. It includes a little all-inclusive lunch of chips, turkey stick,dark-chocolate wafer, and dried fruit to fill in the spaces if the commissary is closed.This was another item that was test-driven at work, and all the components found eager consumers. If someone gifted this box to me, I would be delighted. There's a lot packed into one concise box. Well-constructed and well-enjoyed.", "Those who think I'm kidding obviously haven't flown Coach in a while, and while you can usually purchase a somewhat similar snack/meal from your airline during the flight, it will almost certainly cost a lot more.Theoretically even cheaper would be assembling this snack/meal yourself because GoPicnic is for the most part simply repackaging food products manufactured by others, but of course in that case you will have to do all of the work!The first item I tried was the Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage Snack Bites 6 oz, and they were delicious!Next I triedMrs. May's Dry-Roasted Snack, Cashew Crunch, 5-Ounce Pouch, which I also enjoyed very much.The Snack Factory Original Pretzel Crisps, 6.0 oz Bag were a bit dry; they might work better with dip.Geraldine's Cheese Straws, Traditional, 4.5-Ounceweren't as good as I thought they'd be; frankly they tasted a little pasty.Finally the twoHome Free Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies, Organic, 1 ozbags were delicious!In the enclosedGoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Turkey Stick + Crunch, 3-Ounce BoxI first tried theOld Wisconsin Turkey Stick, Turkey Sausage Snack, 0.5 oz Stickand found it delicious.Next I ate thePopchips Barbeque Potato Chips, 0.4-Ounce Single Serve Bag, which I also loved.The exclusively GoPicnic distributed item, the Ginger Zip all natural fruit & nut mix 0.75 oz bag, wasn't bad.TheMariani Ultimate Apricots, 1-Ounce Unitwere pretty good.Finally, theTerra Nostra Organics Robust Dark 60% Chocolate Mini Square, 0.43 oz.made a tasty little dessert.Note: The meal box also has a Sudoku puzzle in the bottom.Now it is up to you.  You can buy this one, assemble your own, or try one of the other GoPicnic Care Packages or Ready-To-Eat Meals.", "\"I am actually at the tail end of a semester, and I really needed some snacking morsels. While my wife loves me, I don't think she is into care packages. However, I was able to obtain this myself.I don't think anything in this package is going to blow your mind, but for someone who wants a quick and easy snack while they're also digesting books at three in the morning, this really fits the bill. Everything fits well into the package, and it is indeed frustration free.My only qualms:1. The description says (at least twice) that no refrigeration is necessary. This is only half true. The beef sticks are clearly marked \"\"refrigerate after opening.\"\" If you're fine with filling your mouth full of sausage, then refrigeration might not be a problem for you. I enjoy savoring beef jerky, so my bag was popped into the fridge after i popped a few pieces in my mouth.2. The Amazon description of what's in the box is not accurate... but neither is the regular description (however, the picture that shows what is in the box is VERY accurate).Altogether, this is a good mix of salty and sweet snacks for folks who don't have time to make something nice for themselves while being crushed by the weight of the amount of coursework they need to finish by the end of their respective semesters...\"", "When I was in college I would have just loved to get this care package in the mail! It's full of fun treats that would be great while studying, and the selection is varied enough that most people would love to eat it all themselves or share the one or two things that weren't for them.I was particularly pleased to see the meat in his package, because protein is very important for keeping up one's energy, and the white carbs in many care packages are enough to put any student to sleep after munching. The cheese straws were also a welcome addition - even though they do have carbs, they are very tasty and fun to eat.The best thing is that everything's easily wrapped to take to class, on a hike, etc. I even split up the lunchbox contents (popchips, turkey stick, chocolate, dried apricots, interestingly flavored trail mix) and took them on the go on different days.The flat pretzel crisps were fun to serve to friends with the little beef sausages, and the cashew crunch was a universal hit.I'm also glad to note that this brand has gluten-free options, though this particular package isn't one of them. My mom eats gluten free and it can be hard to find snacks on the go when you have to eat that way.", "I thought almost everything in here was good. I have had these pre pak meals before. I like them for the most part. I have to say though calling them a meal is a stretch, it really is snacks, its pretty hard to get what feels like a full meal out of it. Still everything in here was good and not as processed as what you buy off your typical grocery store shelfs. In specific I really liked the cashew clusters. Overall a good snack pak, still a bit expensive for a pretty much a few days of snacks.", "This is something I really didn't know anything about and wasn't sure that I'd like it at all. I was pleasantly surprised! My favorites are the Beef Snack Bites and the Cheese Straws. The Beef Snack Bites are meaty without being greasy and/or salty, two attributes that normally turn me off a product like this. The Cheese Straws were flavorful and surprisingly  light. I'd eagerly buy either of these products without hesitation. The cookies were good, but nothing to write home about. The Pretzel Crisps were also quite tasty but a bit dry. I loved the Picnic Box. A great go-to lunch for hectic days when I don't have time to pack a lunch for work. The Cashew Crunch was also very good, but too sweet for me. Overall, this would be a great treat for a college student, or anyone who just needs a little pick-me-up. However I took 1 star off for the price. This is priced way too high to be a good value. If they lower the price about $10, I'd buy one every month!", "This is a great idea for a care package and comes prepackaged and shipping is great especially if you have amazon prime.  The food would be great for a single person or a clollege student.  I really loved the Pop chips, cheese straws, and the beef bites.  I would love to recieve this from someone.  My only problem is that it seems a bit pricey and the item are really small quantities of each food item. It would be cheaper to buy the items and send yourself but theis is really convenient.  Also the items that are included are not the healthiest out there but they are really tasty.", "I tried the GoPicnic Care Packages along with my family and it was okay. The beef snacks were good and smoky tasting similar to others I have tried included Hormel. Also, the portion on all the products was very appropriate. The cashew Crunch was good, but just in my personal opinion not sweet enough for me but my 15 year old daughter enjoyed it better then I did. The cheese straws were very good, and cheesy without being too greasy and salty, my 9 year and 12 year old enjoyed it just the same. The pretzel crisps are very good and light, and my only complaint is they were too salty, but I feel that is a personal preference. The turkey stick however are not good to me in texture or taste, and the barbecue chips were not that great either but my 12 year old daughter enjoyed them. To me, the texture on both was off. The apricots and the trail mix were great. And finally the cookies were very tasty, and reminded me of the better brands like Ms. Fields cookies or Nestle, which in my opinion are some of the best packaged cookies. There was a hint of something in the flavor I could not place that was different, but they were good and had a great crunch and the perfect amount of sweetness and my husband thought the same.Overall I was impressed with the product and the way it looked and was presented. At the same time,  I can totally envision bringing this on a plane or train - they are perfect for travel especially with a size family like mines ( 4 kids 2 adults)! Aside from that GoPicnic has a ton of different varieties and size packages that my family can choose from.", "\"The GoPicnic Anytime Care Package is a convenient box of snacks that is fun and filling. The pretzel chips, meat snacks, dried fruit, nuts and chocolate chip cookies are quite good and all of the individual packages within the box are large enough to share with a family of four. The only thing my family and I didn't like inside this care package were the \"\"Cheese Straws\"\" which were very dry and flavorless.Overall, with the exception of the Cheese Straws I would recommend this gift box of snacks without any hesitation. This is a simple way to relax with the family and have a nasty little picnic meal. It also makes a nice gift for a family member if you just don't know what to buy for them.\"", "\"Year's ago when my son was going to camp or was away at college, I assembled care packages of his favorite treats to eat.  Now GoPicnic Anytime has done it for me.  If only they had been around 10 or 15 years ago!  This delicious selection of scrumptious treats is perfect to send this summer when kids are at camp, a great idea to send when students are going through finals or mid-terms at school and a tasty gift idea for the bachelor or bachelorette who just never takes the time to have food in the house.  Personally, the pieces and parts can serve as the beginnings of a cocktail party, a healthy emergency meal to keep in the car (always eat before grocery shopping so you buy less!), to throw in a tote when you don't have time to pack a lunch, quick grab and go snacks on a busy day or \"\"emergency rations\"\" for the 3:00 slump at the office.Each of the components is healthy (well, maybe not so much the beef sticks)and incredibly tasty. All ingredients are of the highest quality and scrumptious treats.  The package contains a good selection of sweet and salty snacks that will make everyone happy.  I can't wait to try the other varieties of packages which look to be equally as wonderful.  These are a definite hit at our house.\"", "Let's start with the packaging.  The box this care package comes in is pretty tough so, I liked that.  I'm definitely keeping it for storage purposes or sending something that needs a little tlc.The cheese straws were only so so.  My mom tried them and said they didn't taste like anything to her and I tried them and they at first reminded me of cheese crackers but after a while the taste kind of went away.  The pretzel cripss are great.  They're crispy and crunchy and fun to dip in things.  The beef sticks weren't bad.  A bit on the greasy side, but edible, especially in smaller doses.  I ate them in small handfuls and they keep well in the fridge.  The cookies are fine, just that the package is so small you'll be tempted to eat both.  They're nothing special though, just pretty standard prepackaged crunchy cookies.My favorite item was the Cashew Crunch.  It tasted pretty good and had plenty of crunch.  Again, grabbing in smaller doses is good.  I could probably have eaten the whole package in one go if I didn't have some restraint.  The Go Picnic Ready-to-Eat meal wasn't bad.  The fruit was actually quite tasty and the popchips are flavorful while not being heavy.  Overall, the meal was pretty light, almost better as snacks throughout the day.  I didn't like the turkey stick though as it had a funny aftertaste.Overall though, this would be a great surprise for someone away from home, especially for someone in college, but otherwise there's nothing spectacular about the contents that couldn't be found in the store.", "\"I have to admit, when I requested this item I had every intention of using it as part of a family picnic outing. But, as the summer days have slipped by, it has become apparent that that is not going to happen this year. Plus, gradually the individual packages of the Care Package have gotten opened and sampled.So, I can't speak to whether this would actually be a good item for a picnic. I can say it a great item to use for late-night snack food. Most of the packages are re-sealable, so you don't have to go searching for a clip to close them, or another bag to store them in. Plus, there is a nice mix of unique items here. Enough that everyone in the family will like something. I liked the Old Wisconsin beef and the cheese sticks. My wife liked the Cashew Crunch. And the pretzel thins have been packed for the kids lunch. All good stuff.As a nice additional touch, one of the packages even has a game of Sudoku printed on it you can play while out on your \"\"picnic\"\".Overall, the GoPicnic Anytime Care Package is a cool idea. Not just for picnics, but for snacking anytime. It would be great for trips! (Hmm...maybe next time...)\"", "Hey, this is actually new to me, and at my age I rarely find myself saying that anymore! This Care Package is a box containing six great snacks - beef bites, pretzel chips, cheddar straws, a turkey snack box (actually a mini-care package in its own right), cookies and delicious cashew snacks. All of the products require no heating or refrigerating, come in resealable pouches, and contain no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup.What can I say? Each of the packages in this care package are very good, and add up to a really delicious selection. I have a son-in-law and two nephews in the military right now, and I do enjoy putting together care packages (snacks especially!) - well, the GoPicnic took that idea and ran with it. If you know someone who is far from home, and would like to send them a care package of great snacks that don't melt and are resealable, then order them a GoPicnic Anytime Care Package. They WILL thank you for it!I am excited about this product!", "\"We take quite a few road-trips, and I'm always packing snacks for the car, so I was happy to try this GoPicnic package (nice to leave the packing to someone else :>)Here's what I thought of the individual products:--Mini-chocolate chip cookies reminded me of that \"\"Famous\"\" brand. Very good, without being TOO sweet.--Beef sausage bites were delicious. My partner and I munched our way through the 6 oz bag in one sitting.--Cashew crunch, a little dry, but a true nutty flavor, and again, not TOO sweet.--Pretzel Crisps, VERY crunchy (we like that) and just the right amount of salt for us.--Cheddar cheese straws. A little dry, and not as crispy as expected, but a nice cheesy flavor.--Turkey stick & crunch ready to eat meal. Delicious chocolate, great barbecue flavor on the chips, moist dried apricots. The turkey sticks were the least tasty part of the \"\"meal\"\" but we enjoyed them overall.Now, for anyone wanting \"\"perfect nutrition\"\", or low-fat, low-salt, or anything else in the \"\"low\"\" category, these types of convenience foods are probably not for you.But if you're looking for great flavor and convenience that can't be beat, I think you'll enjoy this GoPicnic Care Package.\"", "We're always on the lookout for healthy snacks, and these came through--at least if you're an omnivore! The sausage bites and cheese straws were the favorites, but everything was excellent quality and not just the same old stuff in the store. Only downside was all that extra packaging--not particularly good for the environment, though the ingredients themselves weren't exactly local. Still, the snacks were good, and I was happy for the chance to try them!", "\"The product is named right: it is a care package.  It has a variety of nice snacks, enough variety that most people will find some they really like, and perhaps enjoy all.  The one I liked least was the sausages.  They tasted good, but left a greasy film in my mouth.  The potato puffs were nice, as were the cashew clusters.  The cheese crisp sticks were richer than I expected.  There are a lot things in the box, and they are mostly things I don't see in the store, so lots of new things to try and enjoy.The brand is \"\"GoPicnic\"\", but this is no picnic lunch, at least, it's not what I would want to have for a picnic.  I prefer fresh foods for real meals.  Since the package has a reasonably short-term expiration date, I would think they could put an orange or apple or two in there.A better approach to a care package is to buy things with the recipient in mind, selecting known favorites and a few things new to try.  With your own care package, you can add some fresh fruits too.But if you don't have the time to shop for it, package it, and mail it, this is a very reasonable substitute.\"", "\"The package(s) of chocolate chip cookies were pretty good. There were, I think, a couple of \"\"meat sticks\"\" of various types. Both were pretty average / adequate. The pretzel chips I didn't much care for, but then I don't much care for pretzels, generally (other than the big fluffy bready kind, as long as they're not overly salted). The cheese straws had a rather odd flavor, thought not bad per se, and seemed very \"\"fluffy.\"\" Somewhere between a long thin cracker and something jet-puffed like the fluffy Cheetos.What stood out for me, honestly, was the Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch. SO GOOD. Might have to see about picking some of those up on their own, they're that good. They're basically just cashews with exactly enough sugar to make them stick together even when cut into cubes and ever so lightly sweet. But not so much sugar as to leave your fingers or teeth sticky. Not entirely sure how they manage it. Almost wonder if they bake the sugar on. Regardless. Really good! I don't know if it's enough to recommend the entire box just for that.On the whole I found more to like in the package than not to like. As a care package for a starving college student, it might be well received. Though, whether the \"\"convenience\"\" merits the price is anyone's guess. One could probably put together one's own \"\"care package\"\" (with even healthier options) for a similar cost. But, on the other hand, for a \"\"no brainer\"\" snack package on a trip or an airplane flight or whatever, one could certainly pick this up and run with it. Maybe not the healthiest thing ever, but reasonably tasty on the whole and very easy to port around and dig into on a moment's notice.Will leave it up to the consumer whether to go with this or make your own care package. But even if you don't get this, you should try theMrs. May's Cashew Crunch, if you're into slightly sweet nut clusters. So good. In fact, now that I think about it, I almost want to go out and see if some local store has some. :) (Of the Cashew Crunch.)\"", "Care packages are fun to receive whether you are at camp, school, or in the military.  The GOPICNIC Care Package is easy to send.  It comes in a nice box that just fits everything.  I checked the expiration dates on each of the items in the box I received.  Mine arrived on April 25, 2011.  The earliest expiration date was June 29, 2011, which was the GOPICNIC ready to eat meal.  Other items had July, August and October for the expiration dates.  I would assume, the items in the box will be consumed soon after receiving, so these dates won't be a problem.  If you are getting this to have some emergency supplies on hand, that don't require refrigeration, the dates might be a bit soon.  It is nice that the items inside do not need to be refrigerated until the individual package is opened.If the person you are sending this to prefers healthy snacks, they might be a bit disappointed in the choices.  There are baked pretzel crisps, but they were pretty broken in my package - lots of crumbs.  The cashew crunch looks okay, although evaporated cane juice is listed as an ingredient.  The cheddar cheese straws get 100 of the 150 calories per serving from fat.  There are 2 140 calorie packages of mini chocolate chip cookies which says nut free and whole grain on the front of the package.  The ready to eat meal says it is gluten free with no artificial colors or flavors.  It contains a turkey snack stick, barbecue potato chips , dried apricots, a fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate.  The final item is a package of Old Wisconsin beef sausage snack bites.  Think Slim Jims in small pieces.  They are 120 calories per serving with 90 from fat.  Consider the person who will be consuming this when you are thinking about sending it to someone.  A vegetarian, healthy eater, calorie conscious person would not be the target audience.", "I enjoyed most of the snacks in this care package. Only one was disappointing, while one was very surprising. Here's the breakdown.Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage Snack Bites -- This was the only snack I didn't like. The taste wasn't outstanding. Everyone I offered some to thought it was a dog treat.Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps -- Big surprise here. I wasn't expecting much from thinly sliced pretzels. They were great and I kept reaching for more.Geraldine's Traditional Cheese Straws -- This snack was also very good. It tasted like a more expensive version of Pepperdige Farm goldfish.Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch -- This was my second-favorite snack in the package. Very tasty -- kind of like an expensive peanut brittle, but with a subtle sweetness and (obviously) cashews instead of peanuts.Home Free Chocolate Chip Cookies -- Good cookies, but nothing special. I enjoyed them, but they weren't memorable.GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch -- A nice convenient snack pack.Sweet Perry Orchards Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix -- Very good fruit mix. I liked this a lot too.Terra Nostra Organic Dark Chocolate -- Quality chocolate, but again, not too memorable.This is a great gift to send to someone. The variety is nice and the quality is high. Outside of the beef sausage snack bites, I enjoyed everything. The pretzel crisps and cashew crunch were excellent. The other snacks were varying degrees of good.", "\"When I first opened the GoPicnic Anytime Care Package, I instantly thought,\"\"I would have loved this when I was in college.\"\" Now, being 28, not so much....mostly because this is basically a box of carbs and fats. Although GoPicnic products seems to bill themselves as a provider of 'all natural' food products, they are nonetheless snacks, and snacks are not necessarily healthy, be they \"\"all natural\"\" or otherwise. That being said, all the products in the care package I received were fresh and overall, pretty tasty. The cheese straws were a little sharp and my young kids didn't care for them very much but I can't imagine a college kid turning their nose up at any of the foods in this box. Definitely a great item to send to a person knee deep in final exams. I wouldn't send this to anyone who is trying to lose weight though.\"", "Having had the gluten-free picnic box for myself, I wanted to try this one on my family.  About half of the items in it are gluten-free.  The overall description says that no refrigeration is necessary, however, if you don't eat it all in a sitting, some of the items do require refrigeration after opening.This box contains:* Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage Snack Bites* Geraldine's Traditional Cheese Straws* Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch* Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps* Home Free Chocolate Chip Cookies* GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch ready-to-eat meal (Old Wisconsin Turkey Snack Stick, Barbeque Popchips, Mariani Dried Apricots, Sweet Perry Orchards Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix, and Terra Nostra Organic Dark Chocolate)The sausages are gluten-free, as are the dried fruits, Popchips, Cashew Crunch, and Chocolate.  Those were all quite tasty, and my family seemed to enjoy the other treats.  The GoPicnic is fairly self-contained and travels well, though the rest arrives loose and will need packing into another container.  The GoPicnic provides a nice little box to sit your food in if you truly are snacking on the go.For convenience, this is a great little collection of treats.  The food is relatively healthy as quick, preserved snacks go, and it's tasty.  However, there is no way I would pay that much for this picnic box.  I'm more likely to track down individual items in it, buy them, and assemble my own goodies.", "\"If you're looking for a good selection of interesting snack foods to give as a gift or just to have on hand for days when you're too busy to eat right, the GoPicnic Care Package is a pretty good choice.Although different selections are available (Lunchtime Favorites, Energy Boost, Fun Foods, etc.), the \"\"Anytime\"\" box that I received through the Amazon Vine program contained six different treats:1) A 6-ounce resealable bag of Classic Pretzel Crisps,2) A 3-ounce Turkey Stick & Crunch Ready-to-Eat Meal,3) A 6-ounce pack of Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage,4) A 4.5-ounce box of Geraldine's Aged Cheddar Cheese Straws,5) A 5-ounce bag of Mrs. May's All-Natural Cashew Crunch, and6) Two 1-ounce bags of Home Free Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies.All items were securely packed in a sturdy cardboard box, made with 100% recycled fiber, and they fit so well inside that no bubble wrap, Styrofoam peanuts or other packing material was required. No one would confuse these items with \"\"healthy\"\" foods, but most of them were not too bad from an ingredients standpoint. For example, the Pretzel Crisps were made with only wheat flour, sugar, salt and malt syrup. The other items had their fair share of chemicals, emulsifiers, additives and flavorings, but probably no more so than most other prepared, packaged foods. You should be aware that these Care Packages have expiration dates--mine expired about two months from the date I received it, so you would not want to stockpile these packages in your fallout shelter.I won't try to describe how the items tasted, since taste is, of course, totally subjective. As a data point, however, you should know that my wife and I practically live on onions, garlic, hot chiles and spicy ethnic foods that we prepare using recipes from all over the world. We no longer bother to buy jalapenos, because they have been genetically \"\"dumbed down\"\" recently (\"\"tamed\"\" is the buzzword)--we have switched to the hotter serranos to sprinkle on virtually every meal. With that said, we found the foods in this Care Package to be pretty tasty and satisfying, with no obvious unpleasant, off-putting characteristics. And you certainly can't beat the convenience.As an alternative to Hickory Farms and Harry & David gift baskets, you should definitely keep the GoPicnic Care Package option in mind for kids away at school, for relatives serving in the military, for road trips or just for a change of pace from your usual culinary routine.\"", "\"Whether or not the GoPicnic Anytime Care Package will please depends entirely on how hungry and/or particular the recipient is.  So, if you're looking for a treat for a hungry, eat-whatever-comes-along, person this may be a real treat.  Otherwise, it may not.I found the quality and taste of the seven ready-to-eat foods to be inconsistent. Our package did not contain the \"\"Sheffa Zesty snack mix, Mariani dried cranberries and pineapple, Swiss Delicato chocolate with almonds\"\" mentioned in the ad, but it did have a few very tasty items:  Pretzel Crisps, Geraldine's Aged Cheddar Cheese Straws, and Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch.  The two small packs of Home Free Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies were voted not good enough to bother opening the second bag, and the Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage Snack Bites were a strange (for me) off-putting orange color.  I also found the sausage/cracker 'meal' to be less than appetising.  But it might bring joy to the hearts of stronger souls.All the items were ready-to-eat, no refrigeration or heating required, and there were no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup in the items we received.  But the sodium content should be noted by those watching their salt intake.Three Stars.
