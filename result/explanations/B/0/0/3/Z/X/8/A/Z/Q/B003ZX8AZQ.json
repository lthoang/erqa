The germins user interface is very user friendly and easy to navigate with little to no load time.  A large touch screen display makes it easy to read at just a glance.  Device follows real time location accurately with very little to no delay.  Lifetime map update is a great addition and definitely worth the buy for just that.", "I will start speaking on the ony negative I find on these. It is that the suction cup does not last very long. I am in the second one and it started falling from my windshield again. I guess I may have to buy a third one. In any case, the Garmin interface seems more intuitive to me than some of the other ones. It also never got `lost` in the same fashion I see other ones get. This your I bought the European maps for our trip to Spain and it worked as well there as it does in the US. The lifetime map updates are a convenience and you can never have enough of them these days with so much construction. Besides the suction cup, if I can find another point for improvement is in the updates themselves. We also have a TomTom and that one seems to have updates more frequently. I noticed the TomTom has construction zones close to home that the Garmin does not. Sure close to home I all familiar with those but it will make a lot of difference if you go to places you do not know. That's the reason for the 4 stars", "I've bought three of these now . ( lost the others ) they work great easy to use and read !! make sure ya get the ones with unlimited map updates though or you're paying a lot for them !!", "\"REVIEW UPDATE  26 Mar 2012Note:  I have updated this review several times, going from a negative first impression (2-stars), through an acceptance (3-stars), and now to an appreciation (4-stars).  There isn't an extensive user manual, but you can find out a lot by simply clicking through all the options.PRODUCT ACQUISITION DISCAIMERI got this unit as a free gift for signing on to automatic payments for a loan. There were other gifts I could have chosen, but only one GPS unit, and only this model.  This is a capable basic GPS model, but I would have opted for more features had I been shopping for myself.PRICEI got it for free, so I can't complain. The MSR price is $179, but this exact model sells in WalMart and Amazon.com for around $100, give or take $5 or $10 now and then. If I was shopping for myself for a stand-alone GPS unit, I think I would have spent a little more for a model with more features.  But for the average non-technical user, this unit will probably meet all their needs.For techno-savvy users, the real comparison, in my opinion, should be against more powerful units and smart phones. Most smart phones have very capable GPS capability.  So if you are in the market for a smart phone, check out its GPS capabilities - you might not need a stand-alone GPS - unless you are going to use it for aviation or marine purposes.MY EXPERIENCEI have owned multi-thousand dollar Trimble Surveying and Vehicle Tracking units. I am also familiar with GPS theory and how it works. To really make a comparison, you should know a little bit about the GPS system and how it works.HOW GPS WORKSGPS stands for Global Positioning System. It was created by the US Military for military applications. It is based on the accurate timing of some 24 special satellites orbiting around the earth. The receivers (the GPS units) on earth are passive receivers that interpret the signals from three or more satellites simultaneously.SELECTIVE AVAILABILITYThe GPS signal can render accurate 3-dimensional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude) as well as the velocity and direction a GPS receiver is traveling - anywhere on the globe. The locations can be very accurate if the full signal capability is accessed. But only the US Military has full access to that accuracy. In addition, the military has the capability to introduce deliberate error, called Selective Availability (SA), to deny the enemy accurate use. Only the US military GPS units can detect and correct for selective availability.DIFFERENRTIAL CORRECTIONCommercial use of the GPS started almost as soon as the GPS satellites started broadcasting. Commercial users almost immediately found a way to overcome the deliberate signal degradation encountered by non-military GPS units. Some commercial enterprises set a GPS unit over a precisely known location, and then compared that with what the GPS unit was reporting. The differences were calculated every second and applied to GPS units as much as a hundred miles away. This technique is known as Differential Correction. It not only corrected for deliberate signal error, but also for atmospheric errors. It can be applied real time, or post-data acquisition. It was so successful and useful that it became possible for GPS to be used in precision instrument approaches for aircraft. The FAA eventually set up its own differential correction system, which it calls WAAS (wide area augmentation system.)ACCURACYThe military has moved on with better equipment and different signals. The military turned off SA in 2000 under Bill Clinton. But the original GPS signal system was left in place and maintained for non-military use. The statistical average accuracy of GPS available for civilian use now, without differential correction, is about 20 meters (66 feet.) With differential correction, it is less than 10 feet. That is the statistical average error. Occasionally, you will detect greater error.THE GARMIN NUVI 1300LMThe Nuvi 1300 is an older model, introduced in 2009 at a considerably higher price. That is now five years ago as I write this review. Considerably better models have been developed, as well as model improvements. This unit is nicely priced at the bottom tier of Garmin offerings.The \"\"LM\"\" designation stands for \"\"Lifetime Maps,\"\" which includes up to four free map updates a year. \"\"Lifetime\"\" means the life of the free updates - not necessarily your life or the life of the unit.The Nuvi 1300LM does not have differential correction, so its reading can (will) be off by yards. I went out on my back patio and tapped the screen icon that said \"\"Where Am I\"\" and it said I was at a house a half a block away. But at least it was on the right street, and even the right side of the street. Despite this error, it is quite good enough for street navigation. And the velocity and direction you are traveling will be even more accurate. When I drive up to my home, the unit's announcer is right on, or, close enough.LOCATIONTap (TOOLS / WHERE AM I?) to show latitude, longitude, and altitude.  For general automobile use, you might not care about latitude and longitude, but if you are out in the boondocks somewhere, you could give that to rescuers to pinpoint your location.  This might also be very useful information for Google Earth on the Internet.In civilization, the nearest address and nearest intersection are more useful, which display in the next two boxes down on the location screen. You can save the location displayed and give it a name.  There are alo buttons for nearest hospitals, police stations, and fuel.ALTITUDEThe most problematic measurement available is altitude.  It matters a lot in aviation.  It is generally unimportant in automobiles.  You can toggle between Direction of Travel, Elevation, or Time of Day to display on the map.  To toggle between options, tap (VIEW MAP), then tap the direction block on the lower left screen and pick the option you want to display.SPEEDOn the lower right of the map is the speed display.  If you tap the speed block, a larger digital speed dial displays.  To the right is also displayed bearing (direction), and Elevation.  Cursor-ing down reveals some more trip details.SIGNAL ACQUISITIONThe Garman Nuvi 1300LM acquires its location in seconds - very rapidly. It must have a clear view of the sky to acquire a signal. You can't be indoors. In a vehicle, the best location is in the center and as far forward on your windshield as you can put it and still reach it comfortably. The location in the vehicle is restricted to the windshield because there is no provision for an external antenna.BATTERYThe Unit's location limitation also means that the unit will be in the sunlight much of the time. The unit is designed to shut off the charger if the sun is shining on it - to prevent the battery from overheating and blowing up or catching on fire. That means that much of the time in your vehicle, the charger won't work, and you are on the rather short 4-hour battery time.The lack of an external antenna option keeps the price low (relatively speaking), but reduces the unit's usability, especially for long trips. Unless you receive this model as a gift, do yourself a favor and look for a model that has an external antenna option.SCREENSunlight on the face of the unit makes the screen hard to read, you can increase the screen brightness (Tools/Settings/Display/Brightness) to compensate.  Increasing brightness reduces battery life. You could make a little screen visor to keep the face shaded, and then keep the brightness reduced with a longer battery life.ROUTE PLANNINGThis is a very simple unit. You can not do multi-stop route planning, or complex trip planning with multiple stops or waypoints, at least not directly. But you can enter all the stops for the trip as separate waypoints (favorite locations). You will have to choose the order they will be selected, and then choose them as a destination one at a time.  For most trips, this is sufficientFortunately, you don't have to input your starting point, only your destination. The unit knows where it is, as long as it is receiving a signal. All you have to do is tap \"\"Go To\"\" and select your waypoint (pre-stored as a favorite location). .WAYPOINTSYou can store up to 1000 locations (waypoints) as \"\"Favorites\"\" in advance. That will make the job of entering each leg easier. Waypoints can be Points of Interest that are already in the database, road/street intersections, points you pick off the unit's map, or addresses that you input and store. To store an Address waypoint, for example, follow these submenus: [WHERE TO? >> ADDRESS >> (input state, city, house number, street name) >> SAVE.Points of Interest in the database will already have a name, such a \"\"Sea World.\"\" But addresses you input will usually not have a name. They will show up in the Favorites list as the house number and street name you input. To enter a name for a favorite address, follow these submenus: [Where To? >> Favorites >> (pick the waypoint you stored) >> Edit >> (input the name) >> Done].Storing and naming waypoints (favorites) is fairly easy.  You can assign a name to any waypoint (favorite) you save.TRACKINGThis unit is not designed for serious automatic vehicle tracking. You can, however, enable the TRIP LOG (TOOLS/SETTINGS/MAP/(then tap the trip log block)/select SHOW/OK).  When set to SHOW, the Trip Log will show your actual path on the map as a dotted blue line.  However I have not found a way to recover location and time for trip stopsThis feature only works when the unit is on, and it can easily be disabled by your errant spouse or child.  If you want to play detective, your best bet is to give your errant one a smart phone that you have covertly subscribed to a tracking service.You can also track yourself manually by tapping TOOLS, then \"\"WHERE AM I?\"\", and storing the location as a waypoint (favorite), and giving it a name, such as T1, and subsequent points as T2, T3, ..., etc.This might be useful for trekking off road and storing the location of that neat waterfall or cave you discovered, or finding your way back on an unmarked trail. If you are going off-road, you want to set the mode to off-road, and store coordinates rather than addresses. The map, however, when you are off road, is useless to you, as it does not contain terrain features - and you can't use terrain maps with this model.EVALUATION - this model does the basics well -- that is it gets you from point A (where you are now) to Point B (where you want to go.) It is accurate enough for street navigation. The text to voice works well, and announces turns well in advance, coming up on them, and when you are there. For most people, it does everything you want it to - for automobile traffic.You can zoom out on the map and see where you have been. And you can review the trip log (dotted blue line) to see where you have been, and how efficiently you drove.This model is still being sold, even though later models are available with a few more bells & whistles.Would I recommend this to a friend? Depends on the friend, their budget, and their needs. For ordinary people wanting a little easy navigation help on a budget - Yes, definitely. For techno-savvy explorers wanting a do-all GPS -- No.  For people with a smart phone -- Maybe.\"", "\"We got this GPS earlier in the month.  It's our first GPS navigator, and we opted to go with Garmin because they usually are preferred by reviewers over TomTom and Magellan, the other dominant brands.  Previously, we had used the GPS system in our cell phone (Sprint) The cell phone GPS was crap--it was inaccurate, routed us terribly, and often couldn't find an address.The Garmin GPS is an obvious step up.  It's more accurate, and it is also easy to use.  Lifetime maps (quarterly updates) are nice, but I'm not sure that they are really worth that much.  We have had a road change in our neighborhood almost a year ago, and it's still not on the latest update.  In addition, it seems that 2 years is the reasonable expected life of a GPS navigator before it fails.  If the updates take years to become \"\"current\"\", then whatever comes from the factory may be as \"\"current\"\" as you are going to get.I haven't had any success at sending the GPS device a route planned with Microsoft's Streets & Trips, Google Maps, etc.  This is disappointing--when routing out a multiple destination trip even locally, its a LOT easier to do it on a computer than it is on the tiny GPS without a keyboard.  Theoretically, it should be possible with MS Streets & Trips--I'll have to do some more playing with it when I'm not in a hurry.  Even so, it would be nice if the device synched with one of the commonly available map software programs.For couples that navigate together--this can get tricky.  The Garmin 1300LM takes several minutes to boot up (we don't leave ours plugged in and turned on.)  It then takes several more minutes to locate the satellites from that cold start.  This can start the trip off in the wrong direction--by the time the GPS device is ready to go, we've driven a couple of miles.  If we'd already started driving before the GPS was turned on, it's even further.  For domestic tranquility, I suggest turning it on (whether or not you anticipate using it) several minutes before even getting into the car.Once the satellites are acquired after turning on, the device is very quick and accurate.  Even if it goes dormant, resuming functioning is much quicker than that initial start up acquisition of satellites.  So far, it hasn't gotten us lost and the option of an \"\"eco route\"\" is great in this day and age.  We haven't used it on our bicycles yet, but we've already learned that we need to manually choose the route with most programs--bicycling is more unique than driving, and most of us are a bit choosier about the neighborhoods we want to ride in to get to our destination in.  We also have a strong aversion to left hand turns on a multi-lane road, another quirk that GPS devices can't calculate for.We are pleased with our device, and anticipate it saving us time, gasoline, arguments and stress in the coming months.\"", "\"I had an old Garmin and was happy with it.  When my mother told me that she wanted to borrow my old Garmin, I told her okay.  Then she dropped it on the driveway and ran over it several times, over several days, before she realized it was even gone.  Still not sure how she missed the broken plastic all over the driveway, but whatever.  At least I had an excuse to upgrade.After countless hours of research and hospital worthy confusion, I decided to purchase this model because of the lifetime maps.  I'm still not sure why I chose this over the seemingly millions of other choices, other than it was on sale and I was tired of the \"\"what ifs\"\".  Now that I have it, I am happy with it.  It allows me to customize to my taste so that it isn't like all the others available. Looking back on it though, I do wish I got the one with handsfree bluetooth technology, but hey, another \"\"what if\"\".\"", "Bought this as a holiday gift. I was disappointed to find that it did NOT have Lane Assist as the Amazon page stated. It was one of the key features I was looking for in making my selection. Feel a bit ripped off.", "\"The Garmin Nuvi 1300LM is a good value.  I've only used it on one road trip and the features are pretty much as advertised.  It was easy to set up out of the box.  It required about 3 hours to reach full charge using an AC battery charger.  Once charged it was easy to connect to the Garmin website, download the client support application and run the process to update the software and maps.  The map update ran about 2.5 hours so, make sure your battery is charged before beginning the process.The device found the GPS signal easily from within our house.  The touch controls work well and it's easy to set up trips with multiple destinations.  The screen is reasonably viewable in bright sunlight conditions (one reason I selected this navigator).  The windshield mount is small and, in my Ford Escape, is easy to connect to the shift console keeping it in a darker area of the interior.My only complaint is that the 1300LM does not have an address book.  It saves last 50 routes as \"\"favorites\"\" but does not have a way to sort the entries in straight alpha format.  You can't sort by name.  You can assign categories to each favorite and restrict viewing to categories.  Not a big issue but not sure why the option is not there.\"", "I have never owned or used a GPS before. Out of curiosity I bought this one because it was on sale and the lifetime maps was a plus. It was very easy to setup and load the updated maps. I get four updates a year which is more than enough - I would buy a paper map every 3-4 years. The size is perfect, not bulky because it does sit on my dash. The color scheme is nice and the screen is very easy to see when driving. The auto change in the map color scheme is nice when it gets dark outside. I have used it on two long trips and even though I had been on those trips before, I followed the directions given by the GPS. It took me a different route each time but directions were dead on and it took about the same amount of driving time.The features are fine for me...remember, I'm a novice GPSer. I don't seem to want any more from what it already offers.", "\"A lifetime map is big to me (a map update costs around 69$ alone).  We have been using our 5-year old 3.5\"\" screen Garmin, the one that looks like the old CRT TV tube.  I can't count how many times we got lost with its outdated map.  We never updated it because the price of the map update is almost half the cost of a new GPS.  Now that the price of a GPS is even more affordable, I finally bought a new one.We are familiar with our old Garmin and thus decided that it would be a smoother transition if we stick with the brand.  I think so far it was a good decision.The 4.3\"\" screen size is just about the right size (although this is a very subjective call).  My brother-in-law decided to get the bigger 7\"\" screen.  It fell off twice already due to its weight.  It also blocks off more of the road in front of you.  The 3.5\"\" on the other hand is too miniscule especially for people who squint to look on their maps.It comes with a mounting base that you stick on top of the dashboard.  The GPS then stand on it with the included bracket and suction stand.  If you have multiple cars, it is nice to get one of those sandbag type mounts like theGarmin Portable Friction Mount.  That way you can grab it and transfer to the next car without any hassle.Pros:- Lifetime update for maps.  Every quarter you can obtain an updated map from Garmin site.- Small and light.- Customizable.  You can add different voices and car icons like Dora the Explorer, Spongebob, etc.  Dora is a hit.  Voices are around 5.99$ and downloadable.- Bluetooth capable for your Bluetooth cell phones.- Phone numbers.  Now it can display the phone number of a business if you select it from the map.  Nice if you are just about to go to a restaurant and want to reserve a table.Cons:- The interface can be better.  Once I start saving addresses, it takes a lot of steps to go back to the main screen to input a new one.- If you go louder than 70% volume, the audio becomes garbled.- It doesn't have a volume dial on the unit.  You will have to go back to the main screen to adjust.- The USB connection is located at the back instead of the side.  This creates some stress on the cable when plugged through the cigarette lighter.\"", "This technology really is amazing ,as other's have mention it takes a few seconds for the GPS nuvi to recalculate the route if you miss the exit !! exactly what happened to me a few days ago ,,!!! but no problem the GARMIN NUVI GPS recalculated my route and  got me back to my destination any way !!! ,,,Love the Garmin Nuvi 1300LM so far ,and with lifetime Map Updays How can you lose ????? ,,the only reason i did no give it 5 stars !! is that I have an older model ,,I saw a video of the most modern model 2595 L,and looks very impressive ..", "\"I replaced an older Garmin unit with this one and was, at first, very impressed with the features and screen functions. Before even using it, I registered the unit and updated the firmware and maps. Upon first use, the unit lost satellite reception three times on a relatively short trip. Thought it must be weather related or just the unit getting oriented. Every trip it did the same thing - the unit would lose satellite reception (using the suction cup on the window - so good visibility to sky and as many as 5 satellites were being received) and the unit would stop for anywhere between 3-10 minutes before it would find reception again. Called the Garmin tech rep who walked me through a reset, reloading firmware, etc. She instructed me that I'm supposed to bring the unit in the house every time I'm not in the car so it won't get cold or hot (get real!). Neither fix change a thing. It may be true that the unit \"\"warming up\"\" contributes to the problem, but I've used Garmin GPS units for over 10 years and rarely had a temperature related problem. Furthermore, the unit works fine when it's cold - the problem can occur any time after I'm starting to use it...randomly throughout the trip (as short as 3 miles) that the unit stops. Can't imagine what confusion this would cause traveling through a big, unfamiliar city. I'm sending the unit back. Amazon was great to work with. Garmin was not! Sorry, Garmin - your products have been \"\"my only GPS\"\" for all these years, but I think we're getting a divorce!A follow-up. I returned the unit (great service from Amazon) and gave Garmin another try with a less expensive unit. The Nuvi 255W was significantly less expensive and has been totally reliable - even when very cold. And to my surprise it features nearly all the same things the 1300 had except the lifetime maps. By the way - I've never taken the 255W in to put it to bed at night! (as suggested by the Garmin tech to correct the intermittent satellite problem with the 1300!)\"", "UPDATED 1/28Unit was returned.  Several times the route recalculated out of the blue.  I was in NYC just about to go through the Lincoln tunnel and the unit when blank (all white screen) and said 'recalculating' and had no guidance for about 30 seconds.  Needless to say I was mad.. I bought a GPS so I would not have to sweat the possibility of making a wrong turn and getting lost down some  back street...  and almost ended up in that same position WITH a gps!  It happened again two days later.  I am going to get the newer nuvi 40LM as a replacement and see how that goes.This is my first GPS.. I usually mooch a friends but for the $99 price it was time to buy one of my own.Unit came and I used the included the USB cable to connect to the laptop and create an account on [...] A quick firmware update and reboot, then I had to download two new maps (not sure why I had to get previous maps, but the version number were 2011.10 and 2011.30) and I was up to date.I like the fact that that I can use this when I walk my dogs in the bush, or take it out on my boat.  I can set a home location by lat/long and return to it either on bike, foot, boat or car.The [...] website is very cool.  Download a browser plugin and the site talks to the GPS to ensure up to date maps and firmware and also got the SN for registration.  Very nice and very slick.I am happy with the GPS... and if this one dies I would buy another.", "This Garmin nuvi 1300LM is very easy to use and accurate. The screen is very clear and the voice direction is loud enough. Registration process is quite involved due to a lot of updates but the current map download is a breeze. Satellite signal pickup is pretty fast. I would recommend it without reservation.", "Its nice not having to worry about where Im going ... generally speaking at least.  But the battery life in this is a joke.  Ive seriously used this about a dozen times since I got it over a year ago and the battery life is already down to about an hour.  That means I have about a 30 mile radius that I can drive without having to plug this thing in.  It has a pedestrian mode on it which I guess is cool if you have to walk about 2 or 3 miles away cause the battery life wont let you get much farther than that on foot.Ive also run into some problems (even though its been updated) where the gps tells me im arriving at my destination yet the destination is up the road another quarter mile and after another left hand turn.  To counteract that though you can save the gps coordinates of where you actually end up and label that the location... should you have to do that? no of course not... but this is the technology we have to work with.Lastly in order to set a location you either have to know the address or turn it on indoors and type it in and hit go then shut it off and go outside (it sets itself to indoor mode if it cant find satellites within a few min) and turn it back on and hit recently found addresses and then hit go again... or you can waste some paper and print out the address and take it to the car and type it in in the car... either way its a pain.  Would be better (since they make you register your gps on their website to get updates) if you could go to their site and put in the address and click send to my gps and have it sent to your gps so that when you get in the car and turn on the gps you just click an icon on the screen (maybe something saying sent from garmin or sent from the web or whatever) and click the address you just sent it and drive away.  Much faster and easier and saves me having to mess with turning it on and off and on and off.", "I had a three year old Garmin navigation system and decided that instead of spending $79 for lifetime map updates, I was better off spending $50 more to replace it with a new GPS with lifetime map updates. Unfortunately, I'm still finding that about a third of the places that I try to locate by name are still not in the system. They are not new businesses and should be available. It does better at tracking addresses.Also, the speaker is not as good as my old one.  It sounds scratchy and takes an effort to understand.  The old one was much clearer.  Maybe the upgraded models have better sound, but this model is not very good.Still, the price was good. I'm probably going to keep it.Six months later.  It still sounds scratchy but I've gotten use to it.

One of the most important features missing is the speed limit of the road you are on.  I work in the northern Virginia and DC area.  Speed limits on roads can switch from 55 to 35 in the blink of an eye.  The maps are also not as accurate as they should be.  There have been changes that Garmin has missed for at least two years now.I was driving in Maryland the other day, when it just quit and had to be rebooted.  This is not the place to have your GPS go out.

Before using any GPS you must connect to the internet and update the firmware, software and maps.  This is a time consuming process, but absolutely necessary.  Once I completed the process the 1300 has work as expected.  The initial satellite connection did take some time, but it seems to \"\"find\"\" the satellite much faster now.  The voice quality leaves a lot to be desired.  It sounds \"\"tinny\"\" and without any range - the speaker must be really cheap.  My old 255's have better voice quality.
