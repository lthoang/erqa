They are solidly built and offer fine image quality.The one caveat is that the price of these seems to fluctuate a lot. Keep an eye on it if you're considering them.My favorite pair in terms of features and overall quality are theVanguard 10x42 Mossy Oak Binocular with ED Glass (Camouflage), although those are more expensive than these.", "I'm no outdoors expert, and I've used maybe 3 whole different kinds of binoculars in my life, so I'm not going to be able to compare these to any other brands or styles...or list tons of information about these that isn't in the Product Description above. What I CAN tell you is that these Vanguard Spirit Ed binoculars are great and I haven't experienced any problems with them at all. Even when wearing glasses, comfort isn't an issue. The clarity and color appear to be perfect when properly adjusted to your needs, whereas some binoculars apparently make things darker than they are. People that I've lent these to say nothing but good things, and tend to use them for extended periods of time.Included with the binoculars are a carrying case, lens cleaning cloth and covers for the lenses. The binoculars fit in the case, but it's a snug fit. I guess this is better than having a loose fit so they don't move around too much when you're on the go.This is probably my shortest review ever since I have such little experience with binoculars. Most of the reviews on this page are 4 stars or higher, with none being below 3. This would make a great gift for any outdoorsman in your life.", "The Spirit ED 10X42 are very easy and fun to use, and make outdoor viewing very pleasurable for me. There is a lot of technology in these binoculars but one thing that is very apparent is that they do let a lot of light through. This is great at dusk and dawn, two tricky situations for binoculars but also in bright sun. They produce about as good an image as possible. I have gone bird watching with these now a few times. And the crisp, accurate image has been very much appreciated. They are easy to focus and a huge plus for me is that they are easy to use with glasses. You have an eye cup on each eye piece that goes down or out if you have glasses. In the out position it is no problem to get one 3D image with both eyes. Something I just plain struggle with using other binoculars.The straps are an interesting concept. First there are lens caps that fit snuggly at the end so don't have to worry about losing them. You also have eye caps that once you attach the strap you will not lose those either. The strap itself is very comfortable. And kind of unique system. The strap comes off of the bincoulars and can attach to the carrying case you can then have a shoulder or neck strap on the case. It does involve a couple of quick clicks. I actually find myself depening upon what I am doing sometimes just leaving the neck strap on the case and holding the binoculars. My only gripe is the case itself is really snug. Really snug. No room for even a pen and small pad of paper to take notes if you wanted. Just big enough for the binoculars and nothing more. Hardly something to mark down a star for.Great performing bincoluars. Easy to focus and use both eyes. Very accurate colors. Comfortable strap. Bit on the heavy side and snug case. Overall though a well-designed product that feels like it will last for years and years. Good investment for a high quality pair of binoculars hunters, birders, concert goers, etc. are sure to love.", "I have to admit up front that this is my first foray into high end binoculars. I'm an avid bird watcher and do own two other pair of binoculars that are not cheap, but definitely not the up to the quality of these. Nevertheless they made for a nice comparison to the Vanguards since I am very familiar with using my others.  Truthfully it took a while for me to see the vast difference in these in comparison.  At first I felt their quality was limited to their feel and workmanship, which is top of the line all the way.  But when I took them down to the coast here to view the seabirds and other wild life in the sanctuary nearby, I was truly amazed at their clarity, and superior color reproduction.  I had never realized how much my cheaper binoculars had failed to display the true colors I was looking at before using these.  The colors of the birds, scenery, truly everything near and far I looked at took on not only a new and fresh vibrancy, but also a clarity that I had never experienced in my other gear.  Superior as the performance of these babies was, admittedly it did take some time to get used to them as well.  One thing I noticed right off is the focusing on these is very precise.  While my cheaper gear seems to be in focus for a generous amount of time while turning the center knob, these Vanguards are much more sensitive.  You turn the center focus knob slowly, for whatever you're looking at will come into crystal clear appearance very quickly, and then pass into blurry.  It took a while to get used to it but once I did I liked the precise focus, as well as the color and clarity.  I truly was amazed at the color and overall performance of these as I compared them back and forth with my others for some time over a variety of distances and objects.  Once I got used to the focusing being so sensitive they were a true joy to use.  Also, these Vanguards have a nice roll out feature on the eyepieces to aid in eye fatigue.  My older ones rely on your holding the piece as close as you can before any darkness is seen peripherally.  It works fine as anyone who has used cheaper binoculars knows, but you have to be careful to hover them at a certain distance all the time.  These Vanguards use a twist out eye piece system which gives you about 3/4 of an inch clearance between your eyes and the actual eyepiece with accomplishes hooding your eyes over the lenses, which once again takes a little getting used too, but was also was found to be superior to me for viewing comfortably in a very short while.  Especially when viewing things outside on a sunny day, or with glare present.  (If you wear eyeglasses, you simply roll in the eyepieces and use the binoculars as you would a standard pair of binoculars...).  I very much found both the roll out eye piece system and precise focus feature to be superior once accustomed to it...In conclusion, not everyone needs or can afford such luxury binoculars as these for sure.  And as stated already, I am no expert in high end gear such as these either.  But what I do know is that in comparison to my other binoculars that are not cheap quality, these Vanguards stole the show in comfort, clarity, workmanship, and overall performance hands down.  If a really good pair of binoculars are  either a necessity or a preference for you, I sincerely believe the price for these are well worth it, and I highly recommend them...", "\"I had eye surgery and have an implant in my left eye, so finding the perfect *anything* is hard.I use these for birdwatching in ANY weather, these are WATERPROOF, and while I did not drop these into water I HAVE used them in rain, fog and snow; and can say these are GREAT binoculars!I really like the \"\"built in\"\" covers for the rear lenses, they are always attached on the outer edge lens, they simply flip down(or they can be totally removed if needed) The front cover is one piece and slips onto the strap if you want it to.The These binoculars are WONDERFUL.They have separate eye-cup settings that truly give you a custom fit. These gave incredibly crisp and focused views. They seem like they will fit just about anyone - the width is adjustable, I noticed I had a slight \"\"shadow\"\", but after I set the eye-cups they went away (Just as it explains in the setup), I then set the diopter, I was 100% it was crystal clear in both eyes, totally blended together! I can honestly say when these were adjusted to my eyes/face I can't remember when I have EVER seen so clear - never mind through binoculars!They come with a soft carrying case, a strap for the binocular and a cleaning lens. As far as the technical (ED lens and such); you can read about them in much more detail than I can offer here, all I know is that these work, they are lightweight, comfortable and really the best binoculars I have EVER had.While I am not 100% sure *how* the lens coatings work.. all I know is that they DO. The image is truly crisp, and clean.. period!IF I had to nit-pick, the instructions are woefully inadequate it is a 3-part drawing. To their defense they ARE written into 13 different languages; but there really is no \"\"how-to\"\" guide on care, setting up etc.I also would of liked a standard \"\"camera\"\" thread for a tripod. They do have accessories, you can purchase but I already have camera tripods and mono-pods and would rather use them.But like I said, if I *HAD TO* nit-pick there you go.. but don't let that deter your decision - these are truly great binoculars!Jim\"", "We have been upgrading our binocs for birding from old cheap stuff to nicer, medium-price range optics. We started a few months ago withNikon 7540 Monarch 3 - 8x42 Binocular (Black)so I had that to compare these to. Of course the Nikons are a different focal power (these are the 8x36), so I can't really comment on the weight difference, but the image viewed in the Vanguard is at least as good as or better than the Nikons (in brightness and sharpness). These also feel good in the hand and appear to be very well built; also, the neckstrap is made of very comfortable stretchy material.If you're in the market for quality optics in this price range I would recommend these binoculars.", "A very solid feeling and well built set of binoculars.  Once my eyes were adjusted, I could see objects in exceptional detail.  Everything seen was bright and crisp, the focus is easily adjusted and does not drift, and there is excellent light transmission on dim mornings and evenings.  Colors are not artificially manipulated (i.e. darkened) either.  It was incredibly easy to adjust the focus and fit to my eyes, even when wearing sunglasses.  They come with a nice eye cup relief to help prevent eye strain - a thoughtful feature to make these more user friendly.  The rubberized hand grip/feel is comfortable.  I didn't have to worry about my hands slipping and messing with the focus because of constantly readjusting my grip (a problem I've had with other binoculars in the past).The set is small and lightweight enough to pack when hiking, and binoculars are items I have eschewed packing because a really good pair is typically too expensive and/or too bulky to justify the additional weight I'd have to carry. I also appreciate that the optics are fog-proof. They come with a very nice neoprene neck strap and carry case. The lens cleaning cloth is a thoughtful addition.  These binoculars are well worth the cost, and I highly recommend them.  Great for outdoorsmen/women, wildlife watchers or sports fans.", "I admit to being a complete binocular novice. I really haven't used a pair since I was a kid using my dad's binoculars.  But I like what I see with these. It focuses easily and everything seems nice and crisp.  I think for an amateur like me that it's probably more binocular than I need.  Nevertheless it seems like an excellent set of binoculars and I really like them a lot.", "When I purchased these binoculars I was looking for a good replacement for my old B & L pair that had finally bitten the dust after many years of faithful service.  The Spirit Ed's arrived in the promised two days and I must say I was pleasantly impressed.  They were light, sturdy and just felt like quality in my hands.  One look through these and wow, the brightness made me realize what I have been missing while using my old pair.  Detail is incredible and since I'm an eyeglass wearer seeing the full field of view was critical.  After quick easy adjustments in the eye relief I was there.  Light, easy to grip, bright-covers and a great field of view and I don't need to remove my glasses to get it .  These are really nice!  If there is a negative I would like to see a shoulder support strap vs the neck strap included.  I've used these while hunting for about a month now and have learned to really appreciate the things I see now that I was missing before.  Love these binoculars!", "This is a nice compact set of quality binoculars.  When I say nice, I say nice value for the money... just like anything, you can choose to spend much more money for better.  In the price range of these binoculars, I think the value is strong.I am primarily comparing these to a different since binocular I have in a similar price range,Nikon 7294 Monarch ATB 8x42 Binocular, and find that Vanguard compares very well.  These are a 8x36 vs 8x42(Nikon), so they are smaller and more compact.  These are better for walking around with.For quality image I take a bit of a basic approach, does it work and can I see what I am looking at. I am impressed with the clarity and the amount of light the binoculars seem to pull in.  What is annoying (but not enough to dock a star) is the eye lens cover...  it seems just too easy to lose.Overall, these are solid binoculars that seem just as good in quality and optics as my Nikon binoculars.", "Ever since I left my previous pair at a football game, I've been on the hunt for a pair that provide great clarity and view while using my eyeglasses.The Vanguard Spirits fit the bill.  It's quite apparent they are definitely built with quality.  I found the field of view with my eyeglasses on to be great!  No narrow views and pain-in-the-butt maneuvering to see.  They are very, very clear and the compact size make them great to take along.I've used these at night, during the day, and even last night at a Lakers/Thunder game.  They're great.  It was easy to keep everyone in view.I highly recommend these to anyone with concerns about wearing eyeglasses while using binoculars.", "The Vanguard 8x36 Spirit ED Binocular is a very good quality binocular that works well for sporting events, nature watching, hiking, camping, backpacking or just to see objects in the distance. The eyecup is comfortable and works well even when wearing sunglasses. The binoculars are easy to use and adjust for a crystal clear view. Color, sharpness, and contrast are great. Works surprisingly well in low light conditions and seems to draw in ambient light to provide a good view. Additionally, these optics are waterproof and fog proof. The binoculars work great, seem well constructed, and are durable.What I do not like with the binoculars are the carrying bag and strap and the way that it is designed. The carrying bag and strap are designed to work together by attaching the neck strap to either the binoculars when in use or to the carry bag when transporting the binoculars. I would much prefer a separate carrying strap for the binoculars and the carry bag. Although it is easy to transfer the strap from the bag to the binoculars I do not find this system convenient. Also, the way the strap attaches to the binoculars makes adjusting the length difficult and not user friendly.Overall, the binoculars work great and deliver a great view. The case and strap, for me, are less than desirable. Despite the strap and case I would still recommend the Vanguard 8x36 Spirit ED Binocular.", "So I own several sets of ED Vanguard binoculars, and I might say these are the sharpest of the lot compared to my 10x and 10.5x ED. No fringing, minimum chromatic aberration, crystal-clear glass, and a very nice-feeling grippy rubber material to protect the binoculars against rain etc.Sure, the optics aren't as good as some Canon lenses I own for my cameras, but then the price difference really is apparent there so you can't complain!Overall, for 8x magnification glasses, these are great, compact, and a very reliable buy.5 stars out of 5."], "Gamma": [0.12506771087646484, 0.12506771087646484, 0.12506771087646484, 0.12506771087646484, 0.12506771087646484, 0.12452596426010132, 0.12506771087646484, 0.12506771087646484], "Beta": [[0.15526176989078522, 0.0002517806424293667, 0.0014415340265259147, 0.1163841113448143, 0.20324213802814484, 0.27764007449150085, 0.000286427210085094, 0.005742390174418688, 0.015237338840961456, 6.739576201653108e-05, 0.0006844642339274287, 0.021476997062563896, 0.2022836059331894], [0.15526176989078522, 0.0002517806424293667, 0.0014415340265259147, 0.1163841113448143, 0.20324213802814484, 0.27764007449150085, 0.000286427210085094, 0.005742390174418688, 0.015237338840961456, 6.739576201653108e-05, 0.0006844642339274287, 0.021476997062563896, 0.2022836059331894], [0.15526176989078522, 0.0002517806424293667, 0.0014415340265259147, 0.1163841113448143, 0.20324213802814484, 0.27764007449150085, 0.000286427210085094, 0.005742390174418688, 0.015237338840961456, 6.739576201653108e-05, 0.0006844642339274287, 0.021476997062563896, 0.2022836059331894], [0.15526176989078522, 0.000251781108090654, 0.0014415360055863857, 0.1163841038942337, 0.20324212312698364, 0.27764007449150085, 0.0002864277339540422, 0.005742396228015423, 0.015237333253026009, 6.739582750014961e-05, 0.0006844651652500033, 0.021476993337273598, 0.2022835910320282], [0.15526169538497925, 0.0002517871034797281, 0.0014415676705539227, 0.11638408899307251, 0.20324204862117767, 0.2776402235031128, 0.00028643442783504725, 0.005742508452385664, 0.015237283892929554, 6.739753007423133e-05, 0.0006844814633950591, 0.021476879715919495, 0.2022836059331894], [0.15526403486728668, 0.000251905235927552, 0.001441843924112618, 0.11639178544282913, 0.20323656499385834, 0.2776164710521698, 0.0002865825081244111, 0.005745020695030689, 0.015246567316353321, 6.744905113009736e-05, 0.0006846553878858685, 0.02148973010480404, 0.20227739214897156], [0.15526176989078522, 0.0002517806424293667, 0.0014415340265259147, 0.1163841113448143, 0.20324213802814484, 0.27764007449150085, 0.000286427210085094, 0.005742390174418688, 0.015237338840961456, 6.739576201653108e-05, 0.0006844642339274287, 0.021476997062563896, 0.2022836059331894], [0.15526176989078522, 0.0002517806424293667, 0.0014415340265259147, 0.1163841113448143, 0.20324213802814484, 0.27764007449150085, 0.000286427210085094, 0.005742390174418688, 0.015237338840961456, 6.739576201653108e-05, 0.0006844642339274287, 0.021476997062563896, 0.2022836059331894]]}
