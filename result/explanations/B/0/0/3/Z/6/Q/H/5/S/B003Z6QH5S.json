Given that, the Elocity was a deal.  It has a good chipset, decent build quality, and worked fine out of the box.  I thought I would love it more than my Nook Color eReader, but I don't.  In fact, I've barely used it since I bought it.The tablet is speedy enough, but it's plagued with a number of irritating issues.  The screen resolution is good enough for basic web browsing and game playing, but too poor to serve as an eBook reader... one of my main \"\"wants\"\".  The screen is not a multi-touch type display like the one on my smartphone, and only \"\"fakes\"\" multi-touch for the pinch and zoom feature.  The screen is otherwise decently responsive, except near the edges.After rooting the tablet, I had access to the Android Market, which was good.  I was even able to find a Honeycomb build for it and tried that out.  While I like Honeycomb itself and this tablet runs it well, the display hobbles the user interface enough that I have decided to dump the tablet.  I'm going to restore it to factory condition, box it up, and sell it here on Amazon as a used item.Battery life is also disappointing.  I can pull it off the charger in the morning, use it for a couple of hours during the day, then leave it out overnight.  When I turn it on the morning, the battery is low or even dead.  (This was true before and after rooting and Honeycombing it.)  I wouldn't want to rely on it for a long plane or automobile trip without some alternate charging method.If you want a somewhat inexpensive, snappy tablet, this isn't bad. If you want something to play media and games (assuming multi-touch isn't a concern for those games), it's probably decent enough.  But if you can spend a few more bucks, there are better tablets out there.  The Asus Eee Pad Transformer, for example, is a bit more expensive than the Elocity but infinitely better.  Its screen resolution is higher, its touch screen really is multi-touch, and it's just better all-around.  (Apple offers refurbished iPads that aren't much more, too.)\"", "I am posting this from my elocity a7 tablet. I will admit I bought one most out of curiosity, but now that I have I feel like I can't live without it.Thing to know before you buy it:1. put the dexter firmware on it... it will give you access to the android market  and gooogle applications. the original firmware is ok, but dexter's will givee you the full android experience.2. no true multi- touch which means the screen can only sense one tap at a time (at least with dexter's firmware)... this limitation has only in part affected my ability to play some games like emulators, which still possible using the control buttons: search and back. Plus, I don't like mobile type of games other than Angry birds which plays fine.3.  Get a microSD w/ a SD adapter so you can upgrade your firmware.Overall, for the price, the performance anb IO connector options... this a great device... very very happy with the purchase.", "\"I am a research freak. Before I buy anything, I put several hours and days into researching what I want....why? Because I don't have alot of money to spend and I want to get the best for my money. So I will try to leave the best review I can.First, I will talk about the cons;1. The speakers really are underpowered, but adequate enough for listening at home. (even if the kids are being loud) Just don't expect a home theater experience and you'll be fine. But for public use, you will want headphones. (which most people would want to keep everyone from listening and or watching your device. I mean seriously, how many times have you had several people around to watch a movie on your 7\"\" device?)2. The hard drive space only being 4gb. I like the micro sd slot, but only being able add 32gb will turn some people off. You can also add another 32gb with a thumbdrive, but who is going to walk around with a thumbdrive hanging out of the machine? For my purposes 36gb total space + 32gb more from thumbdrive is more than enough. But my wife is a pack rat and stores way too much music, movies and pictures. She is limited in this area. (250gb player would have been better if you want the heavier device with more moving parts. I don't like the actual hard drive units because the flash units are more dependable and faster, in my opinion.)Now for the positive;1. Video - very good, especially for a tablet. This is not for your livingroom. It is for portability purposes. It is very pleasing to watch. The darks are a little splotchy, but the vivid color makes up for it. Remember the price and the purpose for the tablet.2. The hardware - Awesome! Dual core, 1.2 ghz. 512mb ram. Very powerful. Makes multi-tasking easy. Internet is very fast. Flash support is outstanding. Multiple apps going at a time and still doesn't slow it down.3. Apps - between the two pre-installed and additional app sites found (amazon appstore, SlideMe) there are thousands of free apps. You won't miss the Android market. It can be found online somewhere for free and is very simple to install. The 4gb of onboard is plenty for your apps. My wife has literally hundreds..., yes HUNDREDS, and still has room left.4. This can be modded to have the Android Market if you wish. The directions are very simple to follow. I bought mine as a gift for my wife and let her decide to mod or not and she likes the factory software. I updated it for her, took 5 minutes, and she has been on it eversince.5. The multi-touch is fine the way it is. With the latest update, you can hardly tell the pinch and zoom is not authentic. It really is no big deal. Again I'll say .....$300.Much more I could say, but won't go there. Very nice for the price. If you are like me, good product for good price this is it. Great hardware. Great video. Great for apps. Great price. Plus, you can get android market if you have to have it.From a research nut case...........this is an outstanding product!\"", "Had this one day so far, but my impression is...I had another tablet before this (don't want to mention brand for fairness), but did not meet with my demands. The main reason I bought this tablet is that I'm a pro musician who sings nearly 400 songs. Since it's impossible to memorize all the lyrics, I use the tablet to play .AVI videos I created to show screens of the lyrics and chord symbols. There is also an .mp3 imbedded in every video. I found this tablet to play all files flawlessly, where the former tablet would at times freeze. This was very embarrassing performing in front of an audience.As for the side icons options (Home, Back, Volume, etc.), you can't see these in the dark. This is a problem so far with most tablets. A mystery to me. What I did, is to order tape that glows in the dark. I cut out similar looking icons and put them to the right of each icon on the tablet which you can't see in the dark, and now have resolved this problem. Update: Tape only glows bright for short time.Another mystery: Why all these tablets don't have user replaceable batteries is not logical, but, if you think of the extra revenue the manufacturer will make because of this, it makes sense to them. In other words, when the battery wears out, you will have to send the tablet to the manufacturer. You will pay for shipping, labor and a new battery. It will set you back $100 or more for sure. Ah, the American enterprise system....PROS: Fast, Bright, Well Built, HDMI Output, USB Input.CONS: 4gb Internal Storage, No Computer Hook-Up (must use micro SD card for all transfers), No Equalizer for Audio or Video, No Included HDMI Cable. Horrendous support!After several months usage, I must say this has the worst battery usage of anything I've every owned... Speakers went out after 10 months. Support said someone will get back to me within 48 hrs. I'm not holding my breath.", "I have an ipad and tried getting the elocity because it came with the tegra chip and nvidia graphics . When I got this the item looked nice and started playing with it . I noticed it doesnt have multitouch which is a big deal breaker for me. The lcd looks like cheap plastic and it doesn't support  full google marketplace or angry birds out of the box. I know this might be an ok product but it was released too late . I rather wait a few more months for a way better tablet than this one or if you want something right now , just spend the extra few buck and get a refurbished ipad from apple that are running for $400 at the apple store online and you can jailbreak them real fast and install thousands of apps free through cydia and also get 10 hrs battery life. my elocity is being return with a lot of velocity..... LOL.", "\"I'm going on my third day with this having previously tried an iPad (Too restrictive) and an Archos 101 (Died in 1 day.)So far this baby is working perfectly. I did install Dexter's mods to get the full Android market. The screen is very sensitive & the pinch to zoom works perfectly. You can't tell it's not true multi-touch.Internet performance is blazingly fast & all videos play without any choppiness or hesitation. The mail program was the easiest to set up I have ever used. Only thing I couldn't get to work was network printing. We have a wired network shared printer, so that may be the problem. If you don't have a newer wireless printer, I think you will be out of luck.The build quality is first rate. I am very pleased with the unit overall. The compact size makes it easy to carry in a large pocket or a small bag. Any negative developments & I will post an update later.PS: I noticed lots of reviews where people were having a hard time getting a case that fit. I got a \"\"Case Logic Cotton eBook Reader Sleeve\"\" that is a perfect fit. You have to like olive drab though. That is the only color it comes in. It's made from a nice soft cotton duck material.\"", "Just got the a7 today and think it is a great device. Even with the original firmware - the device is blazing fast, more below, no WiFi issues and the pinch and zoom is adequate. Firmware Update - Version 2.0121  of 12/24 further improves pinch and zoom - which we will apply tomorrow - and update our review once done. XDA have an Android Market ROM so the a7 can gain access to Market.Build quality is very sturdy - some have commented on its being plasticky - but it's a rubberized, non-slip plastic. Perfectly respectable.We are certain that XDA will do Honeycomb in due course.First off - we should say we are an Apple shop - iMacs, MacBook Airs, Minis and iPads - so when we say the a7 blows the iPad away on speed - we are not coming from an anti-Apple perspective. Quite the opposite. Example - loading cnn.com on the a7 fully rendered in about a half a second - the iPad 6 seconds.1080p playback is super fast and very smooth.Updated Review - 01/17Just applied new firmware rev Version 2.0121 and then Version 2.0124.Fixes all outstanding issues - improved pinch and zoom, better battery.Awesome tablet - almost twice the Quadrant benchmark score of the Archos A70.", "Purchased the unit from local store.The first unit had problem (got boot loop), and exchanged the second unit and it works.Good:very fast (2400-2500 Quadrant score), no hiccup at all with Angry Birdstakes 2 memory cards (microSD+USB)can use USB keyboard1280x800 screen(!!!), it's NOT 800x480 as advertisedBad:short battery (do you see my title?). It works up to 6 hours when watching video with wifi offrunning slingplayer needs some triesweak speakers (USB host doesn't have audio support)no Android market (but you can get hacked ROM from xda)Basically, if it had Android market, it's a best alternative from Galaxytab (wifi only).", "\"As a current iPad owner I was interested in getting a smaller 7-inch tablet and I was interested in getting the Android OS as well.  I realize comparisons between these two devices are fairly meaningless but I think there might be some cross shopping by some people.  If you're interested in a \"\"turn key\"\" setup that works right out of the box, this probably isn't for you.  The eLocity has many features that are essentially waiting to be used but aren't currently ready.  There's a docking port on the bottom, but there is no cable or connectivity to a PC yet.  There is a USB port but you can't connect to a PC at present either.  There is a SD port, but that functionality is not ready yet, etc.  Also, the stock ROM runs fine but there is no Android Marketplace so your choice of apps is limited.This might sound like a bunch of deal breakers but they're really not -- provided you're willing to tinker under the hood a bit.  If you visit the XDA developers forum, you can download a ROM that allows access to the Marketplace and offers a few other tweaks.  With that, the user experience is better as you can download a much wider variety of apps and that's what makes the device fun and useful.Otherwise here's my list of hits and misses:Hits: compact size fits the hands pretty well and is easy to carry; battery life gives a true 5 hours of heavy use; HW is pretty spectacular (dual core processor, Adobe Flash, expandable storage); fairly short learning curve; HDMI output; decent sound; new ROMs available about once per month; user community is making some pretty slick apps and many of them are free; easy email setup (supports Gmail, hotmail, and exchange); fast browsing on the web -- you can tell the HW is a step above all others.Misses: control buttons are essentially invisible in low light; no GPS so apps that use that function will either fail or not work properly; power cord is on the bottom which makes it awkward to hold when charging; no Marketplace unless you want to reflash using the XDA development ROM; some of the apps out there are simply resized \"\"phone apps\"\" like Apple has for the iPad but quite a few of them won't work properly on the tablet so beware.Bottom Line: The iPad is more polished and -- arguably -- easier to use but if you don't mind tinkering a little, the eLocity and it's superior HW work really well and should keep the device current for the rest of the year at least.  Assuming Android 3.0 gets released for the eLocity, that will probably make it even better as the HW can certainly handle it.  Looks like lots of room for growth for this tablet.*** be sure to get a micro SD card as you'll need it to reflash the machine should you decide to upgrade the ROM.  Might want to buy two cards since that's where the user supplied music, pictures, and video get stored and you'll have to erase it prior to an upgrade.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05066028609871864, 0.011339283548295498, 0.7127167582511902, 0.1376579850912094, 0.007620744872838259, 0.003350367769598961, 0.00042415509233251214, 0.06895222514867783, 0.007278253324329853]]}
