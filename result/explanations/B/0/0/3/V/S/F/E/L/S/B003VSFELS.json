"], "reviews": ["\"This is a rather large pack of organic unsweetened coconut chips.  They are moist, chewy, flavorful, and oh so delicious!  I've used the Nutiva brand of coconut oil and loved it, and I'm just as pleased with their coconut chips.  Now be aware, they're not \"\"chips\"\" like chocolate chips--they're more of a large shred or grate.I thought this would be perfect for my granola, but I must admit.  After opening and tasting the coconut, I've been snacking on it right out of the package, too!\"", "When I read dried coconut, I imagined something crispier and crunchier, but instead I found something chewy yet flavorful. I love Nutiva products, and though this wasn't exactly what I was expecting, it's quite good. I've used it in oatmeal, chia bowls, and to make my own coconut milk and it has worked perfectly in each of those uses.", "Previously, I've only used shredded coconut that I've bought from the bulk bins at the local grocery. Since I've been making more snack bars I thought I'd give these a try and see if they added a different dimension. When I opened the package first I tasted a few just to see how they tasted. It's like eating fresh coconut. These have so much more flavor than the usual shredded coconut and a nice texture too.If you are looking for a great alternative to oats in snack bars or granola I'd suggest giving these flakes a try. I've used them a couple of times now in different homemade snack bars and the texture is just like if I'd added oats, giving a nice little bit of crunch. The coconut flavor is not overpowering when mixed, so once you mix in other ingredients the final result takes on the flavor you want, with the coconut just adding texture.", "\"I am rather picky about my baking products and was hesitant to use this product but it has turned out to be perfect for baking.The \"\"flakes\"\" in this product are larger than most products and hold together when mixed into batter or with other ingredients (as in cooked oatmeal or other hot cereals).The flavor is excellent and having an UNSWEETENED product that tastes the way freshly processed coconut tastes is a great advantage.If you have a recipe that requires softer coconut - as in non-cooked puddings, you can retain the shape and texture by STEAMING the coconut for about 5 minutes before folding into the prepared pudding or a meringue.\"", "These are delicious!The chips are large enough that you can snack on them without flurrying your floor. They aren't snack chip/cracker large, but still a good snacking size and I'd, personally, rather have a handful of these tasty treats than other sweet snacks.Usually I use shredded coconut (Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)in my raw food creations and in smoothies (rehydrate it with coconut water or juice first and it blends smoother), but I consider it an ingredient.The Nutiva Coconut Chips could be used as an ingredient, but I surprised myself and went through an entire 1 pound bag just snacking (I put it in a glass jar on my counter and was going to put it away but never got around to it).The Let's Do Organic shreds are tasty and fresh, but the chips (and I don't know if it's the shape or the freshness or the source coconuts) are a bit crunchier than shreds (which are chewier)  but still have a wonderful coolness and a bit of creaminess to them when chewed.I will continue using the handy shreds (I have a case full!) for raw macaroons and dehydrated fruit rolls and I think the shreds are better for surface sprinkles on baked goods as texture-wise I think the chips might feel like an awkward addition, whereas the fine shreds offer flavor and texture that works well with similarly sized things like chocolate chips or crushed nuts (also, a slightly over-toasted shred won't wreck the flavor, but a big chip might).These chips were made for snacking!", "These large, unsweetened coconut flakes add great flavor to baked products.  I have successfully used them in cookies, muffins and granola.  I recently discovered that they are a great addition to my morning oatmeal.  I love the clean, unprocessed taste.  I'm a big fan of coconut, but not the cloyingly sweet type.  These are dry and have a pleasing texture.", "\"Don't be fooled by the word \"\"chips\"\" in the title, this is shaved, organic coconut....that is all the ingredients you have, no oil, no salt, no sugar, no preservatives, just coconut.  If you are used to store-bought coconut you sometimes bake with, this is not a sweet version.  This is the kind of coconut that is excellent used in granola, I always use some coconut in my homemade version and prefer non-sweetened, it is good in chocolate chip cookies, in oatmeal, stirred into yogurt or put into a fruit salad.  I did have to put the bag into a ziplock once I tried the product, which was a bit of a bummer, I always like it when I can just zip up the original bag, but that is a small thing.  This is a nice 1# size so you should get many uses out of your bag.Overall, a great organic alternative without all the extras.  I would definitely consider buying and would let my coconut loving friends know about this product!\"", "These meaty chips are a nice alternative to the typical grocery store shreds. Their size and lack of added sugar means they toast well and don't burn as easily, making them a great addition to homemade granola.The large, full pouches are a good value and don't have excessive packaging.", "\"My experience with coconut up to this point has been mainly with the use of coconut oil. I use it for cooking, baking, and even in my homemade haircare products. I was pretty excited to try these coconut chips. Despite the name, these are more large flakes than \"\"chips\"\". I tasted some right out of the bag and the flavor was  - it wasn't bitter, it was just a light flavor. Now, I am getting over the flu, so my taste buds could have been a little dull, it might have a stronger flavor that I couldn't taste fully. I will say these worked GREAT in some healthy breakfast muffins that I made. The flavor was slight, not overwhelming at all. Just to be honest, if you are used to the sweetened coconut flakes you find in the grocery store, you will probably be disappointed. But, if you are looking for good, quality coconut flakes for cooking and baking - this is it. I can see this working very well in a homemade trail mix. Since the bag is pretty large (1 pound) I am also going to try to make some coconut butter by placing it in the blender for 10 - 15 minutes. I will try to remember to update this review after I try it.For now I can with confidence recommend this for anyone looking for a good, mild tasting, organic coconut. Again, if you are used to the sweetened stuff you probably won't be real happy. It is large flakes, not \"\"chips\"\" (at least, not what a chip is in my mind). I will definitely purchase some once this bag runs out because it brought a new flavor to my muffins (a big deal since I eat these for breakfast everyday).\"", "Coconut is getting a lot of attention these days because of the healthy unique fats it contains.Coconut oil is the richest source of medium-chain fatty acids which are better for you than the long chain fatty acids.Google coconuts and coconut oil. There are many possible health benefits. The chips contain coconut fiber and the fat.I don't bake much so I am using these chips raw as a part of my after workout protein blended smoothies.I think Nutiva's coconut chips are of good quality. Basically all organic coconut chips should taste very similar sincethey haven't been extremely processed. I find these chips to be mild in flavor and I like them very much.There are other organic coconut chips slightly less expensive but I think you cannot go wrong with the Nutiva brand.The only thing that really would improve my experience is if the chips came in a resealable bag.I only use 1-2 tablespoons of it a day so it I had to transfer the chips to a resealable bag. I would use this product again.", "\"I'm not the first reviewer to point out that \"\"coconut chips\"\" isn't the phrasing I'd use in naming this product.  I expected something a bit more like, well, chocolate chips.  Not in cute little processed shapes, but I had a chunkier product in mind.  These are more like large flakes, or shavings.Chips also brings to mind potato chips, which was another thought I had about these... that they might be something good for just snacking on.  They aren't really big enough for that though.My biggest disappointment with these is that the package isn't resealable.  So I finally opened the bag, tasted a handful (mildly coconutty, nice texture) and popped the 1 pound bag into a ziploc.  That worksIt took me awhile to figure out just what to do with these.  What I've found is that they are really easy to add to sweet breads (banana, for instance) or to cookies or other baking. The obvious use is to use them in any recipe that calls for flaked coconut.  But I also tried replacing some of the chocolate chips in my oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and that is pretty yummy.  It certainly doesn't make the cookie a health food, but it does make it a bit less unhealthy.We also stir a tablespoon or so into a bowl of oatmeal, and occasionally just eat a handful as they are.  Since it isn't sweetened, or salted, it isn't addicting.  You can have just one handful.I like that.\"", "\"I must admit that when I saw the product name, \"\"Coconut Chips,\"\" I was thinking along the lines of coconut-flavored baking chips. Imagine my surprise, when I opened the package and saw that it was flakes of dried coconut, instead. But not to worry--I love coconut in any form.First I tried the flakes straight out of the bag. Yummy! What a terrific snack. They have way more flavor than the usual dehydrated shredded coconut--probably because the flakes are thicker and moister than most products. Then I mixed the flakes into a tropical fruit salad. I think it made the best batch ever--again, thanks to the thicker, more flavorful flakes. I sprinkled the flakes on my cereal and intend to include them in my next batch of home made granola or trail mix.I don't think it would be the best choice if you want to make macaroons or other cookies, as the flakes seem to absorb an unusual amount of liquid and may give your haystacks, bird nest cookies, etc. an odd texture. Coconut cream pie, pudding and candies would likely be out of this world--thanks to the fresh coconut taste.I recommend this product to anyone who loves coconut. Nutiva is a brand name you can trust; they make some of the best coconut oil on the market. Hopefully, they'll change the name to Coconut Flakes, instead of chips, so no one else gets confused.\"", "These coconut chips came just in time as I was drooling over a cookbook which had an amazing looking coconut bread recipe.  Once I opened the bag, the scent of coconut was very pleasant, and after sampling some pieces, it was clear these are very fresh and high quality coconut pieces worthy of throwing into your baked goods or for making a homemade granola (that's next on my list).  The texture was easy to chew once baked into the bread and not too overpowering in the coconut-y flavor.I agree with another reviewer that the bag really should be resealable, for such a large quantity of coconut chips, you may be holding onto the opened bag for a while.  I resealed mine with tape and threw it into refrigerator to extend the freshness.I've used Nutiva's coconut oil (organic, extra virgin) and it seems this is a quality brand which can be trusted to give you consistently good quality and great tasting natural products.", "\"Favorite dessert in this house is coconut pie, with banana cream coming in second.  What is so great about this product is that it does not add extra sweetness as the regular brands do, and the chips/shavings have a bit of \"\"chew\"\" which is actually good.  Just finished our second pie made with the product and it was second to none!  It's easy to add sweetness if you want, but when all of the ingredients you would normally use are loaded with it, well...you get the point.  Do recommend this because it is not loaded with extra sugar, it's naturally sweet, and it is an organic product.  Seems hard to find products like this in the supermarket, I'm so glad it is available here and easy to get....thanks!\"", "They are more like shavings and not chips, the coconut comes fresh in a vacuumed sealed bag so it is fresh and not dried out; it is all natural and not sweetened, and has a very light coconut flavor. Would make an impressive topping for coconut frosting, great for granola recipes; putting on top off fresh fruit, and using in many other recipes that call for coconut. Natural coconut is good for you the fat that is in it is the good fat, and since it is all natural it has less sugar which means less calories.", "What I Would Not Use This Product For: Baking. When I use coconut for baking, I prefer the sweetened kind. I would be disappointed with baked goods made with this kind of unsweetened coconut flake. What This Product Is Great For: sprinkling on top of cereal. It's delicious with wheat flakes in the morning, and it would also work in a trail mix.", "\"We've used other Nutiva products before, and always been well satisfied.  This product lived up to past experience.  I hesitate to knock it down to a 4-star rating, even though 5-star ratings are something we're cautious on giving, but there is one complaint (very minor): packaging.  It would really be nice if the package was a \"\"zip\"\" type package rather than just heat sealed.  Once it's opened, it has to be repackaged.  More and more companies are going to sealed \"\"zip\"\" type packaging where the edge of the bag is cut off first, opening up a \"\"zip\"\" closure inside.With that said, it's a great product by itself.  The chips taste fresh, and the flavor was excellent.  And at the current price for six of these one pound packages, it's an excellent buy, considering they're organic.  The photo is accurate, and the product labeling is as shown in the photo.\"", "I love coconut and these chips are just great.  Very fresh and pure.  They have a wonderful texture, taste and smell.  Not overly sweet, but have a pure coconut flavor.  I've enjoyed baking with them and just eating them plain.  They worked really well in coconut rice for texture and I also think they'd be really great in trail mix.  The price is quite good as well.  I'm very satisfied with these.", "\"As other reviewers have stated, these are not \"\"chips\"\" per se, but flakes. But, I found a perfect recipe to actually make these into a healthy snack (google Caramelized Coconut Chips, it is a recipe from theclothesmakethegirl dot com). My kids really enjoyed them, as did I.The best part about these flakes is the fact that they aren't sweetened in the bag, because then you can add them to savory recipes (stir fry, thai recipes, etc.) or sweet recipes (cookies, bars, etc).I had to take one star away for the packaging not being resealable. I ended up putting them into a gallon ziploc bag, cutting out the label and putting it in with the bag so I wouldn't lose it. Serving size is 2 TBs for 50 calories.These are a great addition to my pantry items, and I will be sure to order when this bag is used up. Hopefully they will change the packaging.\"", "This is unsweetened coconut, bite-size flakes that can be easily added to recipes.  I added some to fruit salad.  It would also work well in baking, granola bars and salads.  The coconut flakes were fresh, I like that there is no added sugar, and the one pound package helps make sure I'll have some on hand when coconut is needed.", "I am a big fan of Nutiva products, I've been buying their organic coconut oil for quite a while. It used to be hard to find a good coconut oil and Nutiva was one of the few. Now everybody seems to have a coconut oil out, including TJs and WF and the TJs one is very good but I still order Nutiva from Amazon for convenience. I also use Nutiva's organic hemp oil and hemp seeds (I make milk alternative from the hemp seeds.)So, I was very happy to be offered a bag of these organic coconut chips to review! I wish I'd gotten a six pack, but even one pound is quite a bit of coconut chips - enough to do a lot of fun experimenting with some still left over. These chips smell amazing before even opening the bag!I googled coconut chip recipes and came up with some delicious sounding granola and bars, but the best recipe I found was for coconut milk. Basically, you put a cup of coconut chips in a blender (I use a vitamix) with a cup of hot water. Blend it for a few minutes. Strain it through a nut milk bag (or a paint strainer bag, or cheesecloth in a colander but it's going to let a lot more sediment through) then put the pulp that is left back into the blender with another cup of hot water and strain that through the nut milk bag as well, combining the liquids. It should be about the equivalent of a can of coconut milk. You can adjust the amount of liquid/coconut to make it richer or weaker. One thing I didn't realize the first time I did this was SAVE THE PULP. You can put it in a dehydrator (or in a pan in the oven on 250, but it needs some supervision/stirring if you do it that way) and once it's dry you can put it in a food processor and make coconut flour out of it. This is fantastic because I was just about to order some coconut flour on amazon and now I've just made my own instead!Once I had my (most amazing I've ever had) coconut milk, I made the most amazing coconut curry with it. I usually make a similar curry using a young thai coconut, but this was much more fantastic tasting (although much higher fat as well, I'm sure):Coconut Curry with broccoli1 recipe of coconut milk as described above1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes (you could use a couple pounds of fresh tomatoes just leave out the water from the recipe and cook the sauce a bit longer)3 cloves garlic1 rounded T curry powder1 t. tumeric1/2 t. salt1 cup waterabout 4 cups of steamed broccoli or other veggies (I used leftover garlic broccoli from a chinese restaurant)Put the coconut milk you just made back in your blender. It should still be hot/warm. Add the sun dried tomatoes and garlic and blend a little bit to break up the tomatoes, then let sit for half an hour. Add the curry powder, tumeric and salt. and blend until smooth. Add 1 cup more of water and blend. Pour mixture into a saucepan and heat on medium. Add another cup of water if the mixture is too thick. Stir the broccoli into the sauce. If the broccoli was hot when you put it in, then you're done. Otherwise, reduce heat, cover and gently heat up the broccoli in the sauce. Cauliflower and potatoes are very good in this as well (like an Aloo Gobi).Serve over jasmine basmati brown rice or whatever your favorite rice is.Sorry, I'm not a recipe writing pro...but it's so delicious I wanted to share. I also made coconut/lime/cinnamon rice with it, and a creamy broccoli dal from the book Vegan Yum Yum, using coconut milk where the recipe calls for soy milk, but the curry was the best dish. Next I'm going to try making banana chocolate chip walnut muffins with the coconut flour and I am definitely going to be ordering six pounds of this when I run out.", "\"Think carefully about how much coconut you are purchasing here:  6 one-pound bags.  At $4.62 per bag, I feel this is a fair price for USDA organic coconut chips with no added sweetening or fillers.  However, this is still a lot of coconut.  I just repackaged a one-pound bag into almost four Ziploc sandwich bags because the bag is not resealable. However, a one-pound bag would be an ideal addition to a gift basket or a \"\"just because\"\" gift to a friend.  My package indicated that it was packed on July 10, 2012, and would be best before July 10, 2013.Two tablespoons are 50 calories, and I found that to be a satisfying snack, although to me there was not even a hint of natural sweetness in the coconut.  The Nutrition Facts list saturated fat at 4.5g, or 22 percent and trans fat at 0g.  This is a product of the Phillipines, and it is manufactured for Nutiva, located in Richmond, California.  The packaging directs one to their website for recipes.  Going there, I found that this is a relatively new product for Nutiva, and as a result, there were not many recipes.  I had better luck Googling \"\"recipes for coconut chips.\"\"February 5, 2013 update:  I used this coconut to make macaroons, using a very simple Betty Crocker recipe off the internet.  I put the chips into a processor to make the coconut more shredded, in keeping with with the recipe; the cookies are terrific.\"", "The lone ingredient is organic coconut chips. Chips must be the technical word for this size of flake. If you are interested in eating foods more in their natural state but uninterested in cracking your own coconuts, I'd say this is about the best you can get. These chips are delicious. The taste is light and buttery and mildly sweet.  I like them as a snack right out of the bag. They are a nice addition to my green smoothies and I look forward to trying them in grain-free pancakes.", "These are not chips per se, just inch wide and very thin coconut shavings. But they're perfect for snacking, and will fill you up fast without giving you empty calories. Coconut oil is incredibly healthy, especially when organic, and also just makes you feel good. I'm so glad coconut is finally getting its due as one of the most useful health foods out there, and this is a very easy way to get some of that great oil into you every day.These are perfect desk snacks; I just fill a jar with them and a tight lid keeps them fresh for weeks. I leave the rest in the fridge for later refills. You can snack on these all day and they'll give you a quick glycemic boost that lasts due to the good fats, and you won't get aft, as eating a lot of these takes a lot of time. Very chewy too.At six clams per pack they're a good deal for top quality coconut; we've tried every brand out there for our coconut oil, which we cook with and use as butter on toast, and Nutiva has been our pick for over five years. We buy the five gallon buckets online and save a ton of cash; the oil stays good for years. Plus Nutiva cares about its suppliers and is fair trade in general. We like giving them our money.Great company, great taste, great for you, not fattening...what more can you ask?Hey, how about a chocolate flavor!Well, don't tell, but sometimes I mix these up in a bowl with top notch dark chocolate baking chips. Not quite as non-fattening, but boy o boy, what a great taste! Give it a try and see what you think.", "This product is a bag of unsweetened, very finely shaved pieces of coconut. They don't have an overwhelming taste of coconut, but add well to different recipes -- I sprinkled them on fruit salad, in trail mix, and ate them plain. They're also good added to cold (or hot) oats.Coconut - and the nutrients/fats it contains - has a variety of health benefits, and are a good choice for anyone looking to improve their fat intake (with natural, saturated, healthy fat).As another reviewer noted, that this wasn't a re-sealable bag was disappointing. However, I used a binder clip and a second zip-loc to keep the chips fresh. I've been working on the bag about a month now, and they still taste as good as when I got them. The value for the product is phenomenal, and presuming they remain sealed, they'll keep for a very long time.", "\"If you're looking for a delicious, UNSWEETENED, coconut product with a lot of texture, this is the product for you.  I've found lots of great ways to incorporate these into a variety of foods.  They've found their way into waffles, banana pancakes, oatmeal, cookies, cakes, muffins, smoothies, yogurt parfaits, stir fry, etc.  They toast up nice and the large size gives them good \"\"presence\"\" in your recipes.The flavor is subtle, especially if you are used to the sweetened, moist coconut products.  I've come to really enjoy this product a lot and am glad I gave it a try.\"", "Nutiva is the only brand of Coconut products I buy.  They are not only delicious and fresh , they're Organic.I enjoyed the Nutiva Organic Coconut Chips in my Greek Yogurt this morning for breakfast.  They have a considerable amount of healthy fat that is needed to properly absorb  the fish oil and Ubiquinol supplements I take.  The coconut chips  are healthy and delicious by themselves and  also help deliver other healthy nutrients. Pretty darn great in my opinion.I will use these in holiday baking too.  Drizzled with dark chocolate, they make a perfect healthy snack.  I prefer the Coconut Chips to regular shredded coconut flakes.  I think the texture is more satisfying.  They take longer to chew and slow down my eating.Nutiva also has a great Coconut Manna product.  It's coconut oil with pieces of coconut mixed in.  Great texture.Thumbs Way UP for Nutiva Coconut Chips!", "\"No one would call these just \"\"paper\"\"--the phrase my children use for the coconut in their previous trail mixes.  Nutiva's pieces aren't thick but they are slightly wider offering a nicer crunch in your teeth than your typical grocery store coconut and the taste is mild and pure.  In addition to snacking on it, we both baked with it and toasted it to go on top of curried chicken.  Not often can you taste it in that dish and it was still very good.  I didn't miss the sweetness added to other brands at all.  For the added flavor, the better texture, and the peace of mind that it is organic, it wouldn't be worth going back to generic grocery store sweetened \"\"paper\"\" coconut.
