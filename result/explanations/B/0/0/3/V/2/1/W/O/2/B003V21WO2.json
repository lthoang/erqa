The temperature gauge helps you determine whether the temperature is right for your hair. The swivel base is a must to make sure the iron does not tangle with your hair. The 1 inch width is nice if you also want to use it to create curls and not just straighten your hair.Over a month of use it has performed well. It gives the best results on dry hair although I have used it on semi dry hair.", "I have one from Revlon.  It doesn't give me the kind of gloss that this from Remington does.  My hair frizzes up quickly with Revlon, while this one gives me subtle gloss after.  Also, it heats up very fast.  It's easy to hold and style at the same time.  As a hair straightener, this is a good one to have!", "I had no idea how ineffective my old flat iron was. The plates weren't sleek. It took forever to heat up and when it did the heat was uneven. It felt like a toy and had zero features.Not so with the S9500. This flat iron performs well and has features that I'm finding I won't live without again. For example, the S9500 produces an audible beep when the iron reaches the desired temperature. And you set the temperature precisely. In addition, the iron will automatically shut off after an hour, so you never have to worry when you leave the house.The plates of the iron are sleek and substantial. Hair effortlessly glides between them. In addition, the S9500 has a good ergonomic feel to it. Weight is balanced and it's easy to manipulate in order to achieve the results you want. Overall, I'm very pleased to have replaced my old stinker iron with this one.", "I have a few flat irons, this is my new favorite!After I wash and dry my hair, I have a lot to work with. It is super thick and very long. I have to flat iron it just to bring it down to a more smooth, manageable state.Compairing this to my previous favorite BedHead straightener, I find my hair looks so much better after using the Remington S9520. I would say they both heat up at about the same speed. The digital temperature controls work very nicely, and are uniquely subtle when the flat iron is turned off. When turned on, the numbers clearly show in the handle what the temperature is set at.My hair pulls though it very smoothly, without and pulling or snagging. The plates have a bit of give to them when pressing them together. I find this results in a softer, smoother result with my hair. With long hair and thick hair, these wide plates are much better to use over the 1 inch irons, as it would take all day to flat iron so much hair.If you looking for soft, smooth hair that keeps it's body, try this Remington.If your looking specifically for that super straight, Asian smooth hair style from an iron, then try a BedHead.", "So I tried this straightener on a rainy day when my hair wanted to look like a fuzzy mushroom. The straightener has a nice digital display of the temperature and of the fact that it's heating up. The temperature controls are real easy. It reached my heat selection very quickly and stayed consistent. I didn't have to worry about singeing my hair. And it got the job done! My hair went from thick and frizzy to sleek and straight with just a few quick passes. Much nicer than my old straightener.", "The Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch delivers fast heat-up, smooth results, and adjustable temperature, so you can control the heat of the plates according to your hair type and the ease with which your hair will straighten.This is definitely the prettiest straightening iron I've ever seen, with a black body and pearly-pink straightening plates that are beveled smoothly on the edges, so you can gently bend your ends either out or in (or straight) without getting that inconvenient crimp in the very end you can get with straight-cornered plates.  As for the smoothness of the plates, they made for a very slick trip down my hair-strands, without pulling or tugging even a little.I have very thick medium-textured wavy hair naturally, and I consulted the temperature chart included in the instructions and decided on using the 430-degree heat setting.  The iron goes up to 450.  This setting worked pretty well.  I had also just shampooed and dried my hair this morning, so there might have been some residual dampness when I flat-ironed with this product, which could account for some of the wave left in my hair.  I also treated it with a silicone-based heat-protector.  I was very pleased with the softness and silkiness that using this flat iron gave my hair, but if I were going for a pin-straight result, I'd be a little disappointed in that component of the results I got.  That's why I'm giving this four instead of five stars.  I LIKE it, and it's definitely going to be my go-to straightening iron from now on, when I choose to straighten my hair at home, but I don't LOVE it, in that I'm not inspired to use this product regularly to straighten my hair.That's not to say that in more patient or capable hands than mine, this flat iron wouldn't earn a five-star rating.  It's a very good product, and I think the slickness of the plates is a great feature to reduce drag on your hair while you're straightening, and that has to reduce the damage done by this kind of styling.  So if you're in the market for a new flat iron, this would be the one to get.", "I really liked this product.  I especially like the ability to control the heat settings.  It works relatively quickly at getting the job done.  In fairness, my use of the word 'relatively' is more due to the fact that my hair is now almost waist length so the narrow wand takes more time to cover all the hair. I have a wider wand straigtener that gives me more coverage but the heat control on this model is better.  Most people do not have hair as long as mine is right now so I think this would be ahighly effective choice.  Any important point is that the narrow wand is lighter and, therefore, easier to manage.", "\"Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inchwas probably one of the best products I've ever had the pleasure to test and try for Amazon!  It's small, sleek, and light. There are 3 temperature settings that are tailored to your type of curly hair: 300-340 deg. F. is for fine, wavy or damaged hair, followed by 360-400 deg. F. for normal easy-to-straighten hair, and finally 420-450 deg. F. for thick difficult-to-straighten hair.  I considered my hair fairly easy to straighten as it's wavy and not too frizzy or curly, so I tested this on the medium heat or second setting, which only took 4 seconds to reach. (It beeps when the desired temp is reached.)  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  With my old ceramic hair straightener, I would usually do my hair last (after doing makeup and dressing up) because sometimes the humidity in the bathroom eventually loosens the straightened hair, so I sometimes have a few stubborn ends that start curling by the time I'm done.  With this Remington, not only was it able to hold my style for the duration of my 'preparation' time, it also made my hair look naturally straight--as opposed to artificially straightened.  For those of you with really curly hair, you know what I mean!  With most straighteners (certainly on my old one), after I'm done my hair looks like it's a sheet; people I don't know can tell immediately I've straightened it because of the way it looks: unbendable or too straight that it looks like my hair was frozen in time or something.  This straightener does make your hair look like a sheet for a while, especially after you've done your whole head, but after a few minutes of cooling, it's a soft-looking sheet of hair that swings naturally when you turn your head---much like those beautiful Asian hair you see. I just loved it! Of course, this might be due to the \"\"pearl-infused\"\" ceramic plates that this Remington boasts about.  The plates are smooth and didn't snag my hair at all, but that may be because I was very careful not to snag my hair (you kinda develop techniques on how not to snag your hair on straighteners when you do it often enough).  The plates look and feel as hard as the ones on my old straightener, so I don't have an idea if the Remington's plates will really last longer than those without pearl in them.  I ran a small paper clip through one of the plates just to test Remington's claim that it doesn't scratch easily, and it didn't scratch at all.  (WARNING: This may void your warranty if you do this!  I just did it to test the manufacturer's claim.)  I don't know how much pressure I need to apply to get it to scratch, but I didn't want to press down too hard because I loved the plates' shiny color (pink), too.  The heat shuts off automatically after 1 hour of not using it, which I found a little too long for comfort, so after my first try to check if it did shut off automatically, I just pull out the cord after I'm done.  Speaking of the cord, it's reasonably long, not too long that you might trip on it, but not too short either that you have to keep pulling so you can see yourself in the mirror while you straighten your hair.  I like the hinge lock, which I use when I store it.  Very convenient, especially if you have thin drawers in the bathroom like I do!  It also comes in a beautiful grey box so it's perfect to give as a gift.  Overall, this Remington is probably the best hair straightener I've ever owned!\"", "I've had other remington products I've loved but this by far surpasses the good quality of even those and does a wonderful yet gentle job of straightening curly hair. I love the way the controls are designed... easily accessable but easier to not change the temperature of the flat iron on accident. I love this and Im hiding it from my relatives that want it lol", "I have Asian hair if you will. I barely need straightening, and when I do, I just lightly use these flat irons. This thing is great, no doubt about it. The adjustable temperature is great even though it is a standard in most flat irons these days. For the price though, it's a steal. However, the two plates are not too wide apart, hence sometimes you have to put your hair between them instead of the opposite.It also broke down on me after 6 months. Again, it is to be noted that I am just a light user.", "This little Godsend is ideal for when you are literally having a bad hair day and want to smooth it all over.  Remington has been a long established brand in hair restoration and this high-tech flat iron will gentle hair gone awry and is very easy to use.  You do get high caliber results and the digital controls on this product lock so you don't have to worry about overheating your hair.  Just be sure to follow the directions that come with this item and you will enjoy plenty of smooth hair sailing days.", "I have never straightened my hair before I got this... not because I don't need to (I have wavy hair that tends to frizz) but because I'm lazy about my hair.  But I figured I'd give it a shot when I was offered the straightener on Vine.First of all, even for a novice like me, it was very easy to work.  It was also convenient... it gets hot fast and has a cool swivel cord.  But best of all, it made my hair so sleek and pretty!  I kept looking at myself in the mirror!  And it didn't snag or snarl as I smoothed the plates down the strands.To me it seemed perfect, but since I had no basis for comparison I had my college-aged niece take it for a spin.  She said she liked it as much as her straightener which cost $100.  Cool.Am I still lazy about my hair?  You betcha.... a straightener can't fix that.  BUT I like the ease and result of this straightener enough that I will break it out for special occasion dressup-y events.", "There are two things I love about this flat iron. First is the super fast heat up time. I don't straighten my hair every morning, but when I do, it's generally a last second decision because I notice while I'm brushing my teeth that it's a bit out of sorts and needs a quick slick down. This flat iron has me deeply in love, because if I turn it on as I start brushing my teeth, it's giving me the all ready beep by the time I'm swishing out my mouthwash. The second thing that has me loving this flat iron over my old one is the side controls. At first, I thought they were a little awkwardly positioned, but I realized that while controls on the main part of the handle were a little easier to use, the side controls mean that I don't accidentally turn the iron off or change the heat settings while I'm using it, which happened quite often with my old flat iron.Ultimately, this won't replace a super expensive salon flat iron, but for all practical purposes, it works great for the price.", "One of the great things about this Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Plates is that it heats up really fast if you are in a hurry. There's no waiting for it to reach a high temperature to straighten your hair. Another great plus is that it doesn't pull out your hair. The plates glide effortless through your hair for top quality straightening. My old straightener pulled out a lot of hair when I pulled it down. This one does not do that. It glides and has wide plates.The quality of the product makes your hair perfectly straight in a short period of time. It's fast and easy and works very well, even on thick hair. My daughter has naturally curly hair that is very, very thick and this straightener worked great in record time, even with all of her hair.This straightener gets hotter than our old one. The plates heat up fast and they are super hot for the best results that are faster so you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying if you are burning your hair because this product works so quickly.The results of the hair straightener is that in the end, your hair looks naturally straight, it doesn't look like you spent a lot of time working on straightening your hair (which you don't anyway) but with our old straightener the results did not look as natural, there would be indents and such that didn't look one hundred percent natural. With this product we didn't have to contend with anything like that. We were very pleased with how fast and easy making our hair straight was with this product.This straightener does not burn your hair. We have used a straightener that you could actually smell as it straightened but the ceramic plates did not have any smell when it was being used. The plates are very smooth and get very hot fast and produces Top Results if you straighten your hair a lot, this is a great product and it would also make a fabulous gift.", "The Remington Straightener with pearl plates is a convenient tool for all with hair.  It is easy to set up and use, so even I was able to style my hair.I have never been very good with hair products or tools.  Everyone I know has amazing hair and they always say they did it with a straightener, so I thought I would give it a try.It is very pretty, pearl pink plates and a sleek black design makes it an attractive bathroom accessory.  You plug it in and turn it on and use a digital screen to adjust the temp.  It took just a couple of minutes to warm up and use.  The best feature is the cord actually swivels!!  So as you twist and turn the straightener, you are not caught in the cord.  The temp stayed hot throughout styling, but the plastic did not.  So it was easy to touch and manipulate.I still have not gotten the hang of curling my hair with this straightener, but I think I need some more practice.Very cute, good quality, and easy to use: recommended.", "\"I love the new Remington 1\"\" Flat Iron. I have several flat irons but I think that this one is my favorite. I love that it has a 15 second heat-up (my fastest one). I also really like the auto shut-off safety feature; turns off after an hour if you forget and leave it on.It heats up to 450 degrees but please try it at a lower temp first. I used my one old on the 450 degrees setting but this one got so much hotter than my old one that I fried a section of my hair at 450. Now I use the 380 degrees temp. This one also doesn't pull my hair. My hair will usually get stuck between the plates and the iron itself and get snagged and pulled but it hasn't happened once with this one.I think Remington has really worked on their design, the lock on this one seems to work better than previous versions. The heating plates are longer than most which covers more hair at a time.I really like this one.\"", "The hair straightener by Remington is very well made and feels of high quality.  It's nicely designed, feels good in your hands, one of the prettiest straighteners made and comes in an attractive packaging.  The straightener does work, but my wife has thin hair and it worked fine for her.  She got a smooth silky finish, but says that for thicker hair, it might not have produced the same result.  So, if you have thick hair, you might not like the results you will get with this product (just speculation on our part).  For thinner hair, it works just fine.  Just be sure to follow the instructions.  This product would be great as a gift, or for personal use.  Go for it.", "I was a little hesitant about trying this straightener, but I'm so glad I did. I've been using a very expensive Sedu for the last couple of years, and was pretty satisfied with the results, but when I decided to try this one, I was surprised at how well it works, especially for the price. This heats up much quicker then the Sedu straightener, which cuts my time in half. I think that's the most important thing to me. When I'm trying to hurry out the door, and I have to put an extra hour aside to do my hair, it get's aggravating. With this straightener, I was out the door in about 20 minutes. It does a great job with straightening my hair, I just hope it lasts a long time. I've already had to replace my Sedu straightener twice, and that gets pretty expensive.So even if I have to replace this one, it won't cost me as much. So far this works great, so I'll repost if it breaks down.", "\"I liked this product, but not as much as my other narrower Remington hair straightener (light turquoise color).  I thought the wider plates would be great, that it would take less time to straighten my hair, but that is not really the case.  I find it easier to control the narrower straightener - this 2\"\" plate straightener is kind of clunky and hard to orient on my hair.  However, I do like some features about this product and that is why I give it 4 stars.  It heats up really fast and softly beeps when it is ready.  It has a very cool blue digital display with easy to read numbers.  The placement of the control buttons on the side is an improvement vs. my narrower straightener - avoids the problem of inadvertently changing the setting while holding the straightener in use.  Overall, this product seemed to perform fine for straightening my hair, but maybe I need to use a higher temperature for better results.  I will keep using it and see if my technique improves.  It seems to be a good value for the price.Update 4/3/11Downgrading my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  I have used this several more times and it is really clunky, heavy and hard to use on my hair.  I am getting rid of it since it is not easy to use.\"", "When I first tried this straightener, my hair was shoulder length and thick without any layers.  My hair has a natural wave to it that can be coaxed into full curl with the right product, or straightened if I work in layers.  My barrel ceramic straightener did the job and easily gave me a little flip at the end of the hair.  The barrel straightener, however, is large and a bit clumsy.  It heats up a lot slower and the ceramic is already starting to wear off after about 2 years.In comparison, this Remington straightener is lighter and heats up amazingly fast.  The digital readout is nice and the swivel cord is a big bonus.  However, it just did not do a very good job.  First, the hinge lock didn't work at all.  The second and biggest problem is that the unit doesn't clamp down very tightly on the hair and, because the pearl ceramic plates are so slick, hair just falls right out of the straightener.  When it clamps it's uneven/crooked, coming together at the far end of the unit but staying about 1/4 inch apart at the base.  I could straighten my hair, but getting a little flip on the end or any body to the hair was impossible because the hair fell out immediately.I tried it about 3 times on my shoulder length, thick hair.  Then I got a haircut and my hair now is a couple inches above the shoulders in a very layered shag.  Because of the natural wave, it still needs straightening.  I had the stylist show me how she used her straightener, which was the exact same shape as this Remington.  What I noticed is that her straightener clamped really tightly across the entire unit without that 1/4 inch gap that's on one end of this Remington.  I came home determined to make the Remington work; ironically, it was actually worse now that my hair was shorter and thinner.  It seems that when my hair was thick, it stayed inside the straightener better.The design of this is really nice and I wish it worked better, because it looks like the ceramic will last longer than many other units.  But it just doesn't do the job, so I can't really recommend it.", "I have a much more expensive hair straightener that I bought at the recommendation of my hairdresser, but I wanted an extra one to have on hand in case mine broke.  I didn't want to be caught with half my hair straightened and half poofy while in a rush to get out the door!  I got this one, which I would definitely recommend.  It works just as well as the professional one I paid a lot more for at a salon supply center.  If I had had this one before, I would never have spent so much on the other.  This is quick to heat up, stays very hot and is comfortable to hold in your hand.  The ceramic part is wider than most I've used so I can use larger sections of hair at a time.  I don't have curly hair, so I can't comment on how well it would work for someone with unruly curls, but for my rather fine and fair hair, it works wonderfully to make my hair straighter and more sleek.  It exceeded my expectations and I'd buy one again for sure.", "\"I was just given the opportunity to try this flat iron. I am of mixed race heritage.I am African American and Irish American.My hair is very frizzy,very dry,thick,coarse,and curly.My hair is in it's natural state and not chemically straightened. The length is to my lower back.The iron comes in a nice package with a small instruction sheet.The cord is quite long and conveniently swivels.The iron is very light weight and easy to handle.The temperature control buttons and the power button are perfectly located.The temperature display is large and easy to read.The iron heats very quickly and beeps to let you know it has achieved the desired temperature.The plates are very smooth and a soft pink color.There is a sliding lock near the cord end of the barrel.I found it difficult to engage the lock.I tried this on freshly washed and air dried hair. This iron is very light weight and I felt that I could not press the plates tight around my hair.The barrel also becomes very hot and I could not put my hand on it to \"\"help\"\" my hair through. It glides very easily through my hair.I had to go over the pieces a few times to get them straight. Since the iron is light weight you can work swiftly and with practice complete your whole head quickly.Results wise it straightened my hair but I felt it left it dry and more crisp than I had wished.Also within 2 hours inside my house my hair started to revert (it felt puffier by the minute) I used no product so perhaps that may have made a difference.Overall, I think if you have just wavy or slightly frizzy hair it will probably produce fantastic results.If you have coarse,dry,crisp or damaged hair I don't this is going to transform your hair to shiny, soft and swingy hair.Great product if your realistic about your hair type and your expectations.\"", "This is a solidly-constructed straightener with wide ceramic plates that allow for easy use. Hairspray doesn't seem to stick very well to the plates, which makes keeping the straightener clean much easier. The automatic turn-off feature is great, as is the variety of temperatures available to control the amount of straightening that is achieved. My teenage daughter says that this is great! Recommended.", "This is not my first ceramic straightener, but it has quickly become my favorite.Pros:1) Heats up quickly - not as quickly as 15 s when it is left open, but still very fast2) Beeps when it is at temp3) Wide range of temperatures, adjustable in fairly small increments4) Stays cool to touch - I am able to hold it above the ceramic plates at 380, and it is not hot5) End is cool to touch - well protected from accidental scalp burns6) On/Off button must be depressed a couple seconds with firm pressure prevents accidentally turning it off - plus temp lock7) Wide ceramic plates - love them - my hair curls easily and beautifully over a comb leaving it super smooth (I use it withMoroccanoil, 3.4-Ounce BottleCons:1) The slide switch to lock it closed is *very* difficult to engage - I am almost convinced mine is defective, as it does not slide up all the way even once the iron is closed2) The thickness of the handle or length of the plates (or maybe a combo of the two) makes it difficult to get a good grip to clamp it closed when straightening forcing me to hold it above the plates - this would not work well if I had it at a higher temp settingBottom line: It lost a star for the handle lock, but otherwise I really love this straightener. I have wavy, very thick blonde hair - it straightens or adds better wave without over-drying and handles my thickness with ease. Because the plates are relatively thin - it is very easy to slide between the layers of my hair. Love it!Edit: Two years later, I am boosting this from a 4 to 5 star review because it still works after regular use, still heats up evenly, and and handle lock has now loosened. I am pleased with it's longevity and my stylist thinks my hair doesn't look like I use heat to straighten.", "\"This straightening iron does a great job. That's the most important thing, of course, but let's get into the details:PACKAGING - it's very well-designed packaging with pretty cherry blossoms, which makes it an attractive gift.SPEED - I saw that it claimed to heat up in 15 seconds, and I thought, \"\"Oh yeah? Let's count.\"\" So I counted to 15 and... sure enough... it was hot enough to use. It took about another 15 seconds before hitting the default temperature of 360, but I found that I didn't need it to get quite that hot to work.AESTHETICS - This is a really pretty little thing. The black and pearlized pink just look so sleek.EASE OF USE - It's very cool that the unit allows you to select an exact temperature, rather than guessing with a knob or up and down switches. It beeps to let you know when it's at the right temperature, and an electronic display shows you exactly the temperature you're using. The swiveling cord is a nice feature, too.GLIDING - The pearl-infused ceramic plates do make a difference. They glide effortlessly over hair, with no snags. The other thing I've never found with another straightening iron is that it makes no sound when you close the plates together-- I'm used to a \"\"thunk\"\" noise with my other irons. This one is so darn dainty.HOW LONG IT TAKES - I found that I had to spend about 3 minutes on my hair to get it pin straight after I blow-dried it. I have long wavy hair, medium thickness, that tends to frizz. I did have to go over a few areas two or three times, but still, 3 extra minutes isn't bad to have shiny, healthy-looking hair.WARRANTY - There's a 30-day money back guarantee, and a 4-year limited warranty for replacement.CAVEATS - A few things make me stumble a bit in the use and care guide-- one is that you're not supposed to wrap the cord around the unit. I'm not cool with that, because it's a long cord, and I don't have anywhere to store it. I'm not sure how else one is supposed to store a straightening iron... I always wind the cord around them, and because I have no other ideas for how to store this in my little bathroom cabinets, I will do so here, too. That voids the warranty.Also, the automatic turn-off is in 1 hour. One hour is a very long time. I'd like to see it shut off automatically in half that time, at most. Considering I can get it to heat right back up in 15 seconds, no one's going to get annoyed if it shuts down sooner.The other warning I wish wasn't true was that you're not to lock the unit while it's heating. As a safety precaution, I wish I could do that... I have a child, and I'd rather lock it every second I'm not actively using it.Also, I thought the hinge lock didn't work, but it turns out that you have to really \"\"force\"\" it. If you just stop when it clicks, it won't lock.BOTTOM LINE: Overall, this is a very well-made iron that I expect to use often.\"", "I love this straightener. I have an older style Remington straightener that has a couple issues, but this new style fixes all of the things that frustrated me about the older one. First off, you couldn't touch the end of the old straightener because it would burn your fingers off. This new style sorts that out by adding little extension pieces to each end.Secondly, the ceramic pieces are much higher quality and glide smoothly over hair. And third, the digital read-out is bright and clear and the straightener warms up fast. LOVE it!", "\"This is my second hair straightener. The first was a pricey ghd that is just 1\"\" which I chose because of the rounded barrel. My hair isn't curly, it has just a tiny amount of wave in it...just enough to ruin my hairstyle if I don't do anything to it. I'd heard you could curl hair using a small rounded barrel straightener, so that's what I wanted to do, but it turns out it's really hard to get a result that looks nice. So with this straightener, I only hoped to get something that would make my hair perfectly straight and smooth it out so it will be extra-shiny. It turns out it does do that very nicely, and with the right angle as you pull it through the end of your hair you can get a little bit of flip at the end, which looks quite nice. It also heats up very quickly and has turbo mode (although for my hair I probably never need/want to use turbo) and a nice feature is the LED display showing the temperature. I wasn't expecting that and I think it's great! The \"\"pearl infused\"\" stuff sounds kind of gimmicky to me, but I think this is going to be my new go-to styling aid.\"", "The Remington S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates straightens hair beautifully.

So a couple of years ago my husband gave me a CHI straightener which works great but died right before Christmas. With so many holiday parties coming up, I worried about trusting this much less expensive straightener, but I didn't have the funds to spring for a new CHI to replace my old one.This one really impressed me! It heats higher than my CHI (450F vs. 356F), which is something I appreciate since that means I don't have to run my hair through it as many times. It heats more quickly, too, which is important for those busy mornings. I love that it has an auto shut-off since busy mornings also mean I'm sometimes absent-minded about turning things off. My hair slips through it easily with no snag, and I don't feel like I have to clamp the plates tight with my hand. Although I haven't tried using it to produce curls (I'm not that talented), it gives the sleek look I want without damaging my hair.In short, I love this thing!", "I have a wardrobe of hair straighteners at this point, probably because I didn't want to spend the dough for a CHI the first time around.The Remington S9500 is a good straightener. It is lightweight, literally, which is always a plus in a hair implement. Combing and combing is just annoying when a hair device gets as heavy as a ton of bricks after awhile.Which brings us to my particular issue. These kind of implements get heavy for me because my hair is long and thick. It takes work and effort to drag anything through my hair, including a brush.The S9500 took time. A lot of time. The width isn't what I'd pick for my kind of hair, because it can take forever to get results when the straightener is so thin. The other issue is that it tends to get hot (not unusual for a low-end straightener.) So you have to be a big careful where you hold it, and if you rush it, the results aren't worth the effort.For someone with thinner hair, or shorter hair, it's a fine straightener (but you'll need some kind of hair polish afterward. Seems to make hair a bit dryer than other straighteners.)Good to keep on your list if money is an issue.", "As someone with hair that is never tame, I've used more than my fair share of hair styling products - including hair straighteners.By far this Remington wide plate straightener is the best!I love the degree display option so that you know the exact degree you're using on your hair.  That's my favorite feature.But this Remington straightener is so smooth on hair.  While it holds firm, sensitive heads like mine won't notice.Using it for several months now, I'll say that I'm having many more good hair days than usual. :)And since Remington is know for creating excellent, long-lasting products, I'm betting that I'll keep it around for a long time!", "I have thick and wavy hair with a mind of its own.  It takes a good straightener to bring any semblance of order to my hair.  This straightener actually managed to do the job.  There are lots of great features in this model.  The temperature can be adjusted hotter or cooler in twenty-degree increments.  I used it on the pre-set 380 and it worked just fine.  It heats up in a matter of seconds.  Within 20 seconds I was at full heat.  No more waiting 5-10 minutes for my hair appliances to heat up!  This model si thin, and relatively easy to manipulate.  I would like it if the plates closed a bit tighter, but that might just be me.  Best of all, this managed to straighten my hair with no need of products.  I really can't ask for more than that.  This straightener is an excellent value for the price."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.031321167945861816, 0.03311500698328018, 0.033310793340206146, 0.03045172058045864, 0.029583759605884552, 0.03188493847846985, 0.038135141134262085, 0.0319516696035862, 0.03624748811125755, 0.034461669623851776, 0.033840931951999664, 0.03174157440662384, 0.03389008343219757, 0.029591502621769905, 0.030293285846710205, 0.026336442679166794, 0.034620411694049835, 0.03302275389432907, 0.02568412385880947, 0.02981169894337654, 0.03491128236055374, 0.029390273615717888, 0.03394617140293121, 0.019336629658937454, 0.033735647797584534, 0.029438506811857224, 0.034740883857011795, 0.022714484483003616, 0.02485019527375698, 0.03213026374578476, 0.033746786415576935, 0.03176267817616463]]}
