In fact, when I was setting them up, I thought they were not working as it sounded like the sound was coming from my stereo speakers, but in fact it was coming from the cups.Unfortunately, my experience was marred by the horrible quality microphone. The mic is capped at 16khz, which is very low quality for vocals. While this may be fine for some programs, even in Skype/etc the quality is notable. For actual vocal recordings - commentaries, podcasts, etc - you can forget about it.Another thing to note is that if you record your voice using Adobe Audition, your playback and recording qualities have to be at the same level, meaning you not only have to record at 16khz, but you have to playback at 16khz too. Needless to say, this is a horrible experience.After discovering many wireless headsets have this problem - due to wireless bandwidth limits, sending/receiving high-quality audio and recording high-quality mic seems to be technologically impossible right now - I've decided to switch back to a wired headset.", "I was on the verge of returning this headset when anywhere from 10-15 minutes into a game the audio would cut out completely, even when hooked up directly via USB, and require a restart of the game to regain sound.In the end, the issue was traced down to the fact that my G13, G15 and G930 were on the same USB Bus. Moving the G930's to a different USB Bus, as in the front facing USB ports as opposed to the rear USB ports on the motherboard, resolved the issue.So the headset works great as long as the G13&G15; aren't on the same bus. I can move the keyboard to the front and the headphones to the rear, but not the same bus.It's an odd issue that Logitech needs to work out, I'm not the only one having this exact problem - the solution was posted on their forums where other members described my exact issue. So far Logitech has been claiming that it's an issue with Borderlands 2 or Guild Wars 2 or whatever. Logitech has always had a tough time putting out quality drivers and this is time is no different.So the software is iffy at best and thus the -2 stars.Hardware though is outstanding. I have no complaints about the sound quality, the comfort or the range of this headset. No it won't beat out a $300 pair of wired headphones when it comes to sound reporduction - but it shines as a gaming headset.Finally, before the comments saying my issues were caused by my hardware/software and not Logitech's poor drivers:The PC was built Friday, clean install of Win7, brand new Asus Sabertooth Z77, clean install of chipset drivers, Logitech drivers etc. The PC was as pristine as it gets with no odd non standard hardware or configuration. The issue only appears when G13, G15 and G930 are plugged into the same USB bus. If I use a different brand USB keyboard or leave the G13 unplugged, there are no issues. It seems that Logitech needs to test that all their fancy hardware plays well together.", "Like some of the other reviews on here I have ongoing crackling and popping audio problems. You can Google G930 Crackling to understand just how wide spread the problem is.I have tried numerous &#34;fixes&#34; from Steam forums, Logitech forums and even other more obscure sites with no luck. Uninstalling the software and running Windows default settings is actually more stable and reduces the distortion but it is still there. I'm surprised Logitech has allowed this issue to continue as it appears others have been reporting it since the headset went on sale.On the plus side, the headset is very comfortable and well built, now if they could just fix the audio it would be an instant 5 star review.", "The sound quality on these are fantastic (for music, movies, and pc games).  I have a number of headphones and only my older Sony headphones compete with the quality of sound (but they aren't wireless like these).  The range is great too...I can hear audio coming from my bedroom clearly in the kitchen (about 25-30 feet away).  I don't do a lot of online gaming, so I can't comment on the mic yet.I use these headphones in my bedroom with my computer, Roku (netflix, amazon on demand, etc), original xbox, and ps2.  Initially I was a bit disappointed that these don't work with my consoles, but then found a way to make them work.  You have to have a computer nearby.  I have my PS2, Roku, and Original XBox hooked into my television...then I connected a stereo RCA to 3.5 cable (Red and White) from my television audio output to my line in plug on my computer/sound card.  I use software (audio repeater or virtual audio cable..VAC) to map my line audio in to my G930's and it works like a champ!  Now I can watch movies and play games in bed without waking my wife.  So this same setup would work if I had my 360 or PS3 hooked up to this television.  The only downside of this method is that it outputs stereo sound rather than 7.1 that the G930's can play.The battery life is excellent.  I can fully charge them up overnight and they last a good 7-9 hours of play.  I never play more than a couple of hours at a time so one charge lasts several days for me.The only negatives I have is that the headphones makes a good bit of disruptive noise when you turn your head or adjust them and they are a tad heavy for long gaming sessions...otherwise comfortable.I would highly recommend these for anyone who plays pc games and/or doesn't mind quality stereo sound coming from their console games without the need for a long headphone wire.", "My first 'real headset' was my recent purchase of the Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset, which was a pretty good headset, but because of my set up I needed something a bit more ...wireless and USB based.So I looked up what headsets were nice and fitting of this and this Logitech headset came up, and it was also on sale for quite a sum off. I didn't really know what to expect given the reviews here, in amazon among some reviewers on youtube giving it mixed reviews depending on who you asked.Audio quality:I could leave it at &#34;When I started playing music, I took off my headset in frustration because I thought I set my audio to go to my headset when it turns out that it was infact coming from my headset&#34; but I won't. The audio quality is really nice, in both stereo and simulated surround sound 7.1 (it's simulated because no headset has  a set of 7 speakers in it, it just wouldn't really work would it? I've been playing Titanfall and it sounds great, much better than the previous headset.While I'm not an audiophile I can say the range of tone and bass is wider and deeper, it sounds like the sound is coming from a room with a set of speakers vs headphones.Mic quality:It's good, it's not going to be something you host a radioshow from but it's good enough.Other bits:The buttons function as they should, the mic when folded up mutes the audio and has a red LED to let you know if you've used the mute button. Functions as it should and have not had an issue.The base unit looks dumb, it's 2 wires wrapped around a wire binder of sorts with a USB stick just jutting straight up, however that said it keeps the wires tidy and has a good amount of cable to do the job so function over looks and it wins.I have a large head, very large head apparently as my hat fits on other peoples heads with room for several sets of fingers- and this thing fits no problem, it's comfy.I cannot comment on my ear size but the headset doesn't bother me even during decently long gaming sessions, if you need to take the headset off or give your ears a rest the cups will rest on your shoulders down so it's less like a neck brace and the mic folds up completing the comfortable feel.Battery life and range:I've only had it a week but I can say the batt life seems solid, I think one time I was surprised it was already dead but likely had to do with me using it most of the day and not realizing it. How so? Well I was listening to music while doing some work, then household chores 3-4 rooms away and not only was  there not any kind of disconnect issues but I was easily able to adjust the volume for when a louder song came on instead of having to run back to my room  to change a setting on my PC.Perhaps I'm easily impressed with this because I'm new to wireless headsets but I cannot deny the quality of sound, the comfort and the ease of use even when not sat at the computer. The headset is simply brilliant and if you want one for gaming, for music about the house, this thing will do the job and do it damn well.", "This wireless gaming headset comes with a USB adapter that pairs with the headset itself to provide wireless communication.  The headset, like most headsets, is not comfortable to wear, especially for an extended period of time.  For someone like me who sweats like a pig in the heat of gaming, it's really uncomfortable, actually.  But the sound quality totally surprised me -- for the first time playing games on my PC, I felt I *was* there.  Also, there was little lag, which is an important feature when battling in games. I have to admit I'm more of a cnosole gamer, and the discomfort of wearing this does make me stay away from it, but for the times when I play PC games, this is an invaluable accessory.", "I ONLY GOT THIS HEADPHONE TO WORK ONLY ONCE, AS I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT.  BUT WHEN I HAD IT WORKING IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE.  THESE GAMING HEADPHONE WORKS MAGIC WONDER AND THE SOFEWARE IS JUST SUPER.  I DID SOMETHING WRONG SO IT MY ERROR AS TO WHY ITS NOT WORKING RIGHT.  BUT AGAIN GREAT HEADPHONES!!!", "I bought this headset at Best Buy last month to replace my wireless stereo headphones from Creative.  Set up on Windows 7 64-bit was easy. You can auto-mux all your sounds to the headphone, or if you have multiple speakers, mux your ventrilio to your outside source, game to your headphones, etc.  G930 software is a bit basic, leaving you to decide how to advance calibrate presets for games.  The voice morphing software was a nice novelty to mess around with, but ultimately unecessary bloat.  I would have preferred better EQ presets.I tried these headphones on World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 for PC.  Easily the best sound out of the three is Battlefield.  The game had several different settings to try out, War Tapes being my favorite as it adds reverberation algorythm and extra bass for explosions.  You could actually hear the rustling of people's clothing while walking around in cut scenes.  Pretty amazing to hear the care their sound engineers put into the game.However, the reason why most people using gaming headphones are to hear the sound indicators.  For example, there are distinct sounds to hear in shooters like footsteps, or spell abilities being used like in Warcraft.  After fooling with the sound settings in the G930 software, I found bass/ sub capabilities were only apparent in the side (stereo) speakers.  When isolating the front and back portions of the surround sound, they were very tin-can sounding; even with the subwoofer option turned up.  It was apparent emphasis was placed on the stereo portion of gameplay, with little regard for establishing a good center-channel speaker.  When playing shooters, it was hard to distinguish front and back sounds, such as a person walking behind me versus the front.  There is also a slight sound delay from control inputs to actual sound production.  It wasn't enough to be noticable, but running sound through different sources indicated a slight delay in the headphones. After taking the black foam covering the speakers off, it was painfully obvious many of the issues with sound distinction came from the placement of the speakers inside of the headphone.  It appears some of the channels are simulated surround sound, not actual.  It goes to show, headphones are still no substitute to having a good traditional 5.1 surround set up.Still though the sound isolation, ease of use, wireless characteristics, and bass quality far outweight the G930 drawbacks.  The headphones come with a stereo-surround switch to adjust to stereo programs such as Ventrilio, Winamp and Youtube videos on-the-fly.  The volume knob is conveniently located next to the stereo-surround switch button, making adjustments a snap.  I still haven't found a use for the G-keys, though it is a nice novelty for those who need them.Provided you have a good sound card, you can source your PS3 / XBOX 360 sound through your computer (via optical in/out), letting you use these headphones for the systems. It can be a real money saver for those who are worried these can only be used via PC.  I've enjoyed these headphones thoroughly for casual gaming, and recommend these for anyone needing a better edge with game sound indicators without the standard 5.1 setup.", "Hey all,If you are like me (and apparently hundreds of people online) you have had these for a bit and suddenly they have started buzzing and/or cutting out randomly on you. Again if you are like me this has infuriated you. Luckily there is a solution that may work for you:-Either navigate through control panel or just search in the start menu for &#34;Power Options&#34;-Click &#34;change plan settings&#34; next to whatever plan you have selected-Click &#34;Change advanced power settings&#34;-Scroll down and expand the &#34;USB settings&#34;-Expand &#34;USB selective suspend setting&#34;-Change to &#34;Disabled&#34;Basically for whatever reason these headphones don't cause the USB port to stay on and it'll start drawing not enough power to charge and basically acting like it has DTs or something.Nice headphones, but I can't recommend them to basically anyone. Logitech's customer support team is horrendous and its a shame given how I used to love them.Between this and the G9 being discontinued I just don't know what happened with that company.", "Picked up this headset from Amazon.  First few hours were kind of bad since they had crackling during sound output.  Somehow this was fixed on its own though, as the problem disappeared.  Now it has amazing sound, no wires, and I couldn't ask for more.Got this for Vent gaming on TOR.  We'll see how it holds up to that.", "No problems here. No hiss, and the software equalizer is awesome. I use Raid Call for chat in my Rift game, and have had no problems with it. If anything, the set is a little warm after a few hours. I love how the microphone mutes when turned up, and the surround sound is totally terrific.I was going to buy a Turtle Beach wired, but have gone through many TB headsets as the wires break in a few months. These Logitech are wireless, and the USB dongle is nice and large. Just make certain there are no other metal or blocking things in the way. With my setup, only my wireless mouse sometimes gets blocked (usually by my legs as I game on the sofa.)I really like these headphones. I went ahead and spent the money for them and am very happy!", "So, I bought these on a whim, I was looking for a good wireless headset, emphasis on wireless. Bought these as I have plenty of other logitech products that I absolutely love. This headset did not meet the standards that their other devices put forth. I have owned plenty of logitech products, and currently own a C310, G110 and G500.Aside from 7.1 surround in headphones being a complete placebo, this also makes certain VOIP programs have an immense and distracting reverb effect, with and without the surround switch turned on on the headset. It is less noticeable when surround is on, but everyone still sounds like they are talking into a steel plate (look up plate reverb). Disabling all the speakers except for the main left and right speaker eliminates this issue, but causes another issue.Certain games will only play out of the right ear, if the game does not have a 7.1 output, OR because when not set to 7.1, the audio drivers, a la logitech gaming software, do not properly process the sound into 2 channel stereo.To put it plainly, a fix for one thing breaks something else. You can, more or less, only get one thing working well at a time. For gamers, we generally have a headset to use a VOIP program along side a game, and quite possibly along side either music or a movie as well. When I fixed on thing, it caused issues with something else. VLC was only coming out of one ear cup at one point, having set it to stereo mode or surround mode, caused it to either work with issues in my VOIP, or my VOIP was fine but VLC would not output correctly. This was attempted between computer restarts and program restarts, so the driver was not being toggled and bugged. I also had the same issues with guild wars 2, final fantasy 14, star trek online, and a couple other single player games. Guild wars 2 had a weird bug, as the music and combat SFX (weapon hits, shouts and pain hits) would be in stereo, but some voices, menu sfx (button push sounds) and all dialouge for cutscenes was coming out of the right ear only, when the fix for the overly reverberant VOIP was implimented.I want to point out, without this VOIP fix, the VOIP was practically useless as there would just be an ocean of broadband echo whenever someone would talk.I would GLADLY buy these again if logitech fixed the driver and gaming software issue, but as it stands, these are unuseable for gaming."], "Gamma":
