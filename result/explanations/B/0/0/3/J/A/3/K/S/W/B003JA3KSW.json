"], "reviews": ["I have been using Pantene for years. I was very happy to try this bottle of shampoo. My hair is naturally straight and fine. However, it still has a perm at the ends which leaves my hair frizzy and the texture medium.First thing you will notice about this shampoo is the smell, it smells great but all of Pantene products smell great to me. I use their mousse everyday along with other hair products and the smell is always pleasant. Unfortunately I did not get to try the conditioner that matches the shampoo and cannot locate it locally. Without using both together I am not sure my `results' are what both of the items together would produce.With that being said I did use it with another Pantene Conditioner,Pantene Pro-V Conditioner, Hydrating Curls, 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) (Pack of 2). With both of them combined I did notice my hair was a lot softer and also did not seem to frizz as easily. It was not the weather either, the weather lately has been hot and humid.Overall I did notice a change but no big difference than their other products I use. I will keep it in mind for the future though. For that I give it 4 stars.", "\"I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I'm always looking for shampoos that can straighten my hair so I don't have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I've found is Herbal Essences \"\"Dangerously Straight.\"\" However I'm always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner,Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6).Unfortunately, this shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower.With that in mind, you're probably wondering why I didn't give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in shampoos that are supposed to add body.So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this shampoo, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly.\"", "\"I have waist-length, naturally curly hair and have used Pantene's other shampoo and conditioning products in the past, so I was excited to try this new \"\"Medium-Thick Frizz-Control\"\" formula. My hair normally has a shine, bounce and natural highlights, so I expected this shampoo to enhance those qualities. Unfortunately, I found that the product made my hair dull and lifeless.I tried the shampoo a number of times, alternating hairstyles just to be sure, but found that it left my hair drier than normal and more prone to tangles--and even mats!! I never use anything in my hair besides leave-in conditioner and I tried the shampoo both with and without it. It's a shame--it seemed like it should've been a great product--and I really LIKE Pantene. I so wanted to like this product, but it just did not agree with my hair type.\"", "In order to truly test the usefulness of the product, I selected both theShampoo&Conditioner. This review assumes the use of both products.I'm not a one product type of girl. Right now, I'm alternating betweenBiolage by Matrix&Victoria's Secret So Sexy, depending on my mood. Both of these brands are considerably more expensive than Pantene products, so I was not expecting much from them.In order to fully review them, I committed myself to using only the Pantene products for two weeks. My first impression, from the scent of the product, was that it was a little too fragrant for my tastes. The strong fragrance, however, did not carry from the bottled product to my hair after washing. If anything, there wasn't ENOUGH fragrance that remained in my hair. To my surprise, I did find that my hair seemed thicker after a couple of weeks of use. I was pleased with the product and will continue to use it, although I still enjoy variety and will continue to use other products.", "I used this shampoo with Pantene Naturals Conditioner.  It left my hair feeling dry and was only minimally helpful against frizz.  I have long thick hair and have had better luck with Biolege products.", "I was excited to try this new shampoo because it's been very humid lately and my normally relatively smooth straight hair has been annoyingly frizzy. I was hoping to tame the light frizz without having to use any styling product, which I prefer to avoid so that my hair stays cleaner longer.I'm disappointed to report there is absolutely no difference between hair washed with this shampoo and hair washed with any other shampoo. If I didn't know better, I'd say my hair was actually frizzier.It gets 2 stars because it does get hair very clean (I had lots of gunk in my hair before washing from a failed hairdo experiment) and it smells nice.But don't expect ANY change in frizziness, even with very mildly frizzy hair.", "My hair tends to get frizzy no matter what time of year it is. In the Summer, it's the humidity that makes my hair frizz and I have a problem in the Winter as well. But I've found that Patene's Frizzy to Smooth Shampoo really does cut down the frizz that I get. It took a few shampoo's to really notice the difference but it definitely worked. It doesn't surprise me because I've found that Pantene always does make nice shampoo that does what it's supposed to. The smell is quite nice as well. It's a pleasant smell and it isn't overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone that has frizzy hair and is tired of dealing with it.", "\"Great product.  It works well on long hair and provide a pleasant scent, while it works to repair the frizziness.  It works best if you usePantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)after you use shampoo.  You get six os 12.6 oz bottles.  Bottle has a \"\"stand-up\"\" shape which is also convenient.\"", "\"First of all, you get a lot of lather from little shampoo, so the bottle should last for quite some time. The smell, for me, is a bit too fruity and I wish it had a more neutral scent. This shampoo is tauted as a product for frizz-control, so the most important aspect of it was whether or not my hair felt less frizzy after I used it. I have very thick hair and it's quite long right now so I wanted to see if this shampoo would buy me some time before my next haircut. The result: My hair feels clean and it does lie closer to my head, controling the \"\"bigness\"\" of it. I realize that others say that this didn't help their frizziness at all, but for me, the product did what it claims to do. Recommended.\"", "I have three teen girls who want to maintain great hair health and two have very long hair.  This shampoo has been a favorite among all of them. They are thrilled with the smooth hair results and I can attest to seeing less of the wild frizz they sometimes would have.  They like the scent and are happy with the appearance of their hair at the ends.  The biggest point I can make is that they wanted more when the bottle ran out.  So, I'd recommend this shampoo.", "Wow, I was really impressed with this new conditioner. It's got a great scent, & feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair. I typically have very thick & frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to conditioners, I thought I'd give this a shot & am glad I did. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the commercial. They advertise that you're supposed to wake up in the morning without the frizzy do. I kinda assumed this was BS from the get go & therefore am not being uber critical, but there you have the 4 stars. Another thing I'd like to add is normally when using conditioners my hair is very tangly after a shower, with this though no tangles at all.  In the end I'm very satisfied with my purchase & would definately buy this again.", "I suppose my hair matches the type targeted for this product, as it is thick. And with it being [self-]cut as short as it is, it can be prone to frizz (not that it bothers me). I just wanted to try the shampoo, okay!?After using this shampoo, my hair feels soft and smooth and my head doesn't look like a fuzzy coconut as it normally might when using some other shampoos without conditioning. The product tackles the problem of dry frizz incredibly well, and it lathers up nicely too.If you have a problem with dry, frizzy hair then I suggest you give this product a try. I think you'll like it.", "One of the first things you'll notice about this product--and all Pantene products--is that you only need to use a very small amount. In this case, just a small squeeze yields lots of suds. Your hair will feel clean and look healthy after shampooing, too.This is the only product I'll use on my hair. I've tried many other shampoos and conditioners over the years, but Pantene makes my hair look its best.One thing to keep in mind, though, is that most people will need to use a conditioner after shampooing. If I didn't, I'd never be able to comb through my wet hair.", "I have long hair and I like Pantene products. I don't really pay that much attention to which products I use but I thought that I would give this one a try when the opportunity presented itself. I am definitely satisfied with the results but I don't know if I will have any strong desire to go out of my way to purchase this shampoo again.This shampoo works fine. My hair isn't particularly frizzy by nature though I occasionally have issues because I am a water polo player. This shampoo seems to prevent problems though I am not sure if this was even a problem to begin with at this time.I recommend giving this shampoo a try if you have problems with frizziness. It's definitely worth a shot and you may see some results. I think I did.", "A fan of Pantene for a long time, I was used to hearing rumors of how 'bad' it was for your hair, etc.  However, this never wavered my love for the Pantene.  And this product, Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick hair solutions Frizzy to smooth shampoo just seals the deal.My hair is wavy -- often unmanageable.  I can style it and one hhour later the waves have come through and the frizz has set in.  With this shampoo, I noticed that with only two washings, the difference in the ability I had to style my hair and the style's shape to maintain, even in heat, went up considerably.  When I flat iron my hair, that style actually stays for longer than just mere blowdrying.The price of this shampoo is reasonable and had it been more expensive, I would pay it.  I liked it that much.Natalie S.", "\"I have been using this product along with the matching conditioner for the last several weeks.  My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner:1) The shampoo is runnier then the normal Pantene, so when you first use it, be careful because it's easy to run it over your hand and waste some of it.2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.3) My hair did stay more \"\"calm\"\" although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.4) I didn't find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.In conclusion - I'm not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn't find anything wrong with them.  I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  It's no miracle but it can help a bit.\"", "Two of the women in our house are blessed with curly, prone to frizzy hair.  I'm not the primary user of this shampoo, but it seems to be liked by our gals and doing the job!", "This tamed and smoothed my long, salt and pepper hair without making it feel flat and lifeless.  I am loving this shampoo.Sometimes conditioner can weigh my hair down, so I try not to use it that often.  I don't have to use any conditioner when I use this shampoo.  It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine, with beautiful body.  I also like that it smells fresh and clean, not like perfume.Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine.  I'm happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs!", "I have not always been a fan of Pantene products -- but this one changed my mind.  First:  it smells great - fresh, clean and not overly perfumed. Second: great bubbly, lather that rinsed cleanly. I have naturally curly hair, which tends to be dry.  This shampoo left my hair moisturized, but not weighted down.  I was impressed with how soft, managable my hair is and I think it tamed frizzies pretty well.", "\"This shampoo does not leave my hair perfectly \"\"frizz free,\"\" but it does seem to be a better start to the \"\"defrizzing\"\" ritual than others I have tried.  I was able to use it with its companion conditioner, and it does leave my hair smooth and soft.  Unfortunately, it does not leave it entirely frizz-free.  If I air-dry my hair, by the time it is dry, it does have noticeable fly aways.  If I finish the ritual with a \"\"defrizzing\"\" shine product or mousse, starting with this shampoo and conditioner does allow the shine products or mousse to do their jobs.  (On my hair, without the Pantene Solutions shampoo and conditioner, neither mousse nor a defrizz shiner can control my hair's frizz completely.)This is good shampoo, as one would expect from Pantene.  It is a little thicker than some of their other shampoos, and it does seem to help a bit in the frizz taming.  Don't count on this shampoo alone to solve your frizz problems, but it can be a good first step.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.029082685708999634, 0.04862062260508537, 0.052617285400629044, 0.04793127626180649, 0.05451926589012146, 0.0516277439892292, 0.05194244533777237, 0.053537607192993164, 0.05490972101688385, 0.050648681819438934, 0.04229474812746048, 0.055059581995010376, 0.05580804497003555, 0.054374851286411285, 0.046262457966804504, 0.031981710344552994, 0.052499786019325256, 0.04564822465181351, 0.05738493427634239, 0.06324829906225204]]}
