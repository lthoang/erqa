"], "reviews": ["I purchased Almond/Apricot and Almond/Coconut and they are both delicious!These bars are made mostly out of almonds and other nuts, held together by sweet syrup (not too sweet).Both have a hint of coconut flavor (Almond/Coconut has a slightly stronger coconut flavor). The apricot adds a bit of tang to the flavor, which I really enjoyed. I liked Almond/Apricot slightly better for this burst of tartness.Each bar is individually wrapped, long and slim, and easy to slip into a purse and bring along when you need a bit of pick-me-up on the go.I highly recommend these bars!I am attaching a photo with the wrapper off with one bite taken, so you can see the texture of the bar inside the wrapper.Ali Julia review", "I'm a fan of many Kind bars but have a favorite non chocolate variety. These are more sticky in texture and the ribbons of coconut create a chewier activity which makes them last longer than other varieties. I actually tend to eat half at a time, keeping the second half in the refrigerator where it becomes more firm. I'd imagine that if you don't like sticky or chewy foods, you won't care for these. I love them and don't look forward to the box nearing empty.", "If you are already a KIND bar lover, like me, then you will not be disappointed with this apple, cinnamon and pecan bar.  The apple flavor is noticeable, although the cinnamon is not so much, while the nuts are plentiful; and the bar itself is moist and crunchy with no gluten.  At 180 calories, this bar makes a perfect breakfast or lunch for me in watching my weight; they are satisfying and in my opinion one of the most tasty bars on the market.  Even if you just want a mid-morning or afternoon snack, this is a great choice.  At $14.44 per box, a bar is about $1.20, a better price than I can get them for in the grocery store.", "If you're gluten free because of celiac or gluten intolerance, Kind Bars *look* like they're great.  But they have a problem--they have a double-whammy of being both high fructose (most celiacs have acquired fructose intolerance) and having inulin.  Inulin is just bad news for sensitive tummies.  If that's you, eat these and you'll have a rumbly, painful tummy.It would be funny, but they taste so yummy.  Larabars are a lot less lethal and less expensive. (Larabars made without apples are mostly dates, which are o.k. in small quantities, for most people with celiac-disease related acquired fructose intolerance.)", "Kind Bars have become my go to snack once a day. I do not crave sweets when I have one . This combination of two flavors is just right.Each box has 18 bars including two flavors: Fruit & Nut Delight (9) and Almond & Apricot bars (9)This mini whole nut and fruit bars are made from ingredients you can see and pronounce Gluten-Free; Wheat-Free; Dairy-Free and a Good Source of Fiber.The most important part is that this bar tastes delicious!Recommended. prisrob 05-27-14", "I know, I shouldn't really be bragging about stuffing my face, but oh man are these good and satisfying.  I'm a nursing mom, and when I get hungry, watch out.  So that's why I had 3 of these today!These are absolutely my favorite for fighting that sudden rush of hunger.  I know they're still a snack food, but as snack foods go they are better than most, and they are delicious and satisfying.  As an aside, I do like that they fit neatly in a cupboard or pantry.  I hate that feeling of piles of snack food, and these are more modest than that.Almond & Coconut is the best flavor, by far.", "The cost of the items is very high.  Almost $1.60 for each bar.  In my opinion, this is excessive.However, these bars are fantastic and you can literally see all of the nuts (whole) that make the bar.  The exterior is slightly sweet, but is really balanced with the falvor and crunch of the nuts.  It is about the perfect size bar for my breakfast.I bought the one's in the yogurt since it gives the bar a creamy smooth flavor.I will continue to buy them since they're the best nut bar I've had."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.14793969690799713, 0.13495425879955292, 0.14876621961593628, 0.14458899199962616, 0.1289265900850296, 0.14268873631954193, 0.15213556587696075]]}
