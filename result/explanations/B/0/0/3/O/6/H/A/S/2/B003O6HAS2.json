It's highly scripted and it follows the story of a fairy tale where you are the sorcerer's apprentice on a quest to, of course, rescue the charming princess who... but we're not supposed to reveal the plot, right? It's probably Okay to note that the story is a lot closer to a Brothers Grimm tale than Tolkien's.I can reveal that you go through the story, page by page, chapter by chapter and, as you overcome increasingly difficult challenges, your sorcery skills grow. I've only covered the first 5 or 6 chapters so far and I'm looking forward to playing some more after I'm done spreading the word through this review :)GAMEPLAYSure, there's a story and sure there's adventure and exciting combat but a lot in Sorcery is about showcasing the Move controller which is why I thought this should have been a launch title.You would normally play standing up because there's a lot of wand waving, shaking and turning. You move in the world and initiate certain actions through the Nav controller and you cast spells, aim them and perform various other combat actions such as shield-bashing with the Move. It's hard to describe and it does involve learning new skills and it requires some coordination and good reflexes but you are learning things and tricks as you go and you have the opportunity to practice a lot on the weaker enemies before you fight the first really difficult boss.From time to time you do die but you simply get back to where you were before the last battle started. It sounds like too easy but combat is hard and you may end-up dying 5 minutes into the battle so if you manage to die a couple of times in a boss battle it CAN be painful.Like I said, the game is highly scripted and sometimes the dialogues that make sense the first time you engage into some specific melee don't the next time you face the exact same enemies - how many times can you be 'surprised' that a certain enemy is immune to a certain spell and then here your wise companion suggesting that maybe you should try something else?Oh, and there are several levels of difficulty. I'm surviving on the normal level but I can see how very challenging it would be to beat the game while playing in the hardest mode.OVERALL QUALITYThe graphics are so-so, not exactly impressive with most of the enemies looking like Macy's parade floats but they fight... not too well or too smart but their relative ineptitude is more than made up by their numbers. Or this seems to be the case so far.What makes the game fun is the original Move-based combat system. You get to use specific gestures to select your spell and specific moves to aim it including the equivalent of throwing curve balls. The Move-as-a-wand is also your key to opening doors, the stir when you make potions and the shield when you must deflect incoming missiles or bash back enemies that get too close. The Move interface is surprisingly good, precise and responsive.THE FUN FACTOR AND MY RATINGScripted as it is, the game has been very fun to play so far. My first 5-6 hours of playtime took me through several chapters. It's hard to tell how far from endgame I am now but I assume there must be at least a dozen hours or so left to play because there seems to be more powerful spells to learn, potions to make and tougher bosses left to defeat.I'm giving the game 5 stars in the 'fun' category but I am not going to rate it as a 5-star overall, mainly because of the poor graphics quality and the overscripted and almost dumbed-down story line but this is not why most of as are going to play this game. As bad as the graphics are, the active waving of wands is immersive enough to make Sorcery a fun little game to play.", "Sorcery is just a fun Move game.  I really enjoyed playing through the whole game and plan on playing again to collect all the chests.  It was just a lot of fun mixing spells together to create fire/lighting tornados.  The story was decent and the gameplay had some slow down issues, but it didn't distract from the overall experience.  Boss fights required some strategy on how to deal damage to them, but nothing to hard.  I was able to beat all the bosses first try on the medium difficulty setting.  Just needed several potions on a few of them.", "Clearly the game is not intended for hard core gamers who typically prefer God of War or Gears of War, but rather for a casual gamer or younger audience. I happen to be a hard core gamer and yet I still find I am quite enjoying this game based mostly on how it makes good use of the Move controller.Pros:- Good use of the Move controller- everything from casting spells to mixing potions.- Recognition of commands with the Move is pretty accurate most of the time.- The visuals are decent. The look of it is appropriate to the type of game it is.- Ability to combine elemental spells reminds me of the game, Magicka, which I enjoy considerably. Nice to have a gestural version of Magicka.- Ability to research different combinations of ingredients to yield different spells.- Ability to change difficult level during the game.- Game pacing is good. It knows your arms will be tired after an intense bout and so gives you a break.Cons:- Short game.- Camera control is annoying some times.- In practice the need to combine powers is minimal as soon as you get the lightning element.Younger gamers who are into casting magical spells like Harry Potter are likely to enjoy this game a lot.Players who enjoy a game on its own unique merits (in this case the use of the Move in well thought out ways) will likely enjoy this brief distraction also.Players who couldn't care less about ingenuity and just want to blast aliens like in Gears of War, should probably skip this title.", "Its so much fun ,they should have kept the art style this game had when it was first announced ...I don't like the motion comic presentation with added voice/acting these games are coming up with ,this game deserved to get the full blown treatment .when the move and navigation controllers are in your hands it works flawlessly . I love arching my wand shots .harry potter deadly occuracy only way cooler.", "This is hands-down the absolute best game I have played for the Move.  I know this because I not once had to fiddle with the controls or calibration while I played it.  It really does work well and makes you feel like a Sorcerer.  This is the game that makes the best use of the Move's capabilities as it was built specifically for the device.  Mending stairways and mixing potions worked really well.  The graphics are good, not great, but the world is very colorful and pops off the screen.  I also really enjoyed the story, as it is one that people of all ages will like.  The music is very good too, as it displays elements of Celtic themes.My only complaint is the slight lack of polish.  A level select feature and new game+ mode would have been nice to assist in getting trophies.  And it could have been a bit longer, but I myself do not mind short experiences as long as they are fun and immersive, as Sorcery is.I wouldn't quite say that this game by itself is worth buying the Move for, but you definitely should buy the device for this and other great games like Medieval Moves and Sports Champions.  If you already own the Move, this is an absolute must buy!", "Overall the controls and overall gameplay make this an enjoyable addon for the PS3 Move game library though it really is a little to short in the gameplay department for the price it's still a reasonable deal.  The graphics,voice cast,effects and storyline all fit nicely together and the game does make good use of the abilities of the Move control and remote. If you already have the Sports Champion game or Start The Party I say this is worth adding to your gaming lineup.", "\"Ok, finally a great game for the Move that I actually have fun with! I've been wanting this game for a while now, but it took so long to come out that I forgot about it. It was on sale on the PSN store so I picked it up. All I can say is that i haven't had this much fun in a long time with the move. The story is pretty good, and the game play is a lot better than I expected. Be warned your arm will get tired (I swapped arms, and not only was that interesting but fun), but that is a good thing right? I found myself standing while I was playing and walking like I was in the game. (I need the exercise) I luckily had the other Move remote, and that is the first time I actually used it for anything. I'm glad I had it, because it's much easier than trying to hold the regular controller in on hand. I played a hour straight and would have kept going if I didn't have to go to work. The only negative is sometimes it can be hard to hit a certain target, but I just think I have my camera in a bad spot. Regardless, it is actually very accurate. So if something is \"\"off\"\" if you do the exact same move it will go in the exact spot. I hope another sequel comes out. If your going to get this, please buy it new so we can have more games like this. It's only 10 bucks as I write this. I think anyone will enjoy this game.\"", "Beautiful PS3 game, I was looking for a nice game for the ps move bundle. My girlfriend and stepdaughter are from Argentine so they don't speak English, but this game has a Spanish version as well with it, its pretty cool and they got a lot of fun with it.", "If you are looking for a title that uses both the Move and navigation controller, then this is the one for you.  After playing this game you can fully realize the potential of the Move controller.  I would say that this title is probably the best Move title that I have played to date.GRAPHICSThe graphics won't be taking on a title like Crysis by any means but they are still pretty good.  The art design of the game is interesting and the array of characters and enemies I have encountered are unique.  Cutscene art is interesting and is done in a style that makes sense and works for this game.VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting isn't going to win a 'best of' award but it is pretty solid.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is unique, providing an experience that can be addictive at times.  The Move controller is used as a wand and the navigation controller is used to move your character around.  The Move button is used with specific move control gestures to change spells, and it works seamlessly.  This is the Harry Potter game people were looking for when Harry Potter was still relevant.  Better late than never.  There is also a potions mixing mini game so to speak.  Your permanent ability increases are handled by researching and discovering new potions to increase your overall health, mana, etc.  An interesting aspect to health potions is that you need to shake the bottles up with the Move controller and then tilt the controller to drink them.  Drinking the health potion is done in real time, which adds some excitement if your health is aleady low because you can still take damage while trying to drink the potion.  You can tell that the game developers put a lot of time into integrating as much Move motion controls into the game as possible.  The good thing about it is, they did it without forcing it.  Each move makes sense in the context of it's application in the game and the environment.The fighting in the game is enjoyable and satisfying.  Casting spells is fairly accurate although I have experienced the occasional errand cast.  Enemies are designed such that certain elemental types affect them more than others.  The developers made a deliberate effort to send enemies at you in groups that require you to switch spells often.  For example, shield bearing enemies are impervious to all spells as long as they still have their shield.  This requires you to cast an earth borrowing type of spell to hit them and make them drop their shield.  The earth spell doesn't do much damage, so your are then forced to switch back to your Arcane Bolt in order to damage them.  You can also combine a number of spells for increased damage.  For example, you can lay down a wall of fire to keep enemies at bay and then cast a whirlwind, which combines with the fire making a fiery tornado.  This tornado will suck enemies up into the funnel as they enter the tornado's path and do massive damage.One draw back is related to character movement.  I  have had issues with movement where my character gets temporarily stuck when trying to move.  It hasn't happened a lot, but when it does it can be annoying.STORYThe story is about a young apprentice wizard that, due to circumstances as the story unfolds, is reponsible for protecting a princess.  I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at hat.  There is more to the story than I expected for a Move title.  It's no Heavy Rain by any means in that department, but it also is no Super Mario Brothers either.  The story is enough to keep you interested without affecting the action and pacing of the game.There is an epicness that surrounds getting new spells that as the game progresses you get the real sense that you are becoming a more powerful wizard, even if physically you still look like a puny apprentice.SOUNDThe sound is pretty good in this game.  There is an orchestral score that adds ambience that is not obtrusive and pleasant to hear without becoming repetitive.SCORE/RATINGAs far as Move games are concerned, I would give this title 5 stars.  The game is shorter than I would like, but I think it demonstrates the Move better than any other title I have played to date.As for racking it up against other titles across all control types, I would give it 4 to 4.5 stars.  There are enough minor things that need improvement that I can't flat out give it a 5 star rating overall.  If they gave it another 6 months of polish the game might have earned 5 stars because it definitely is 5 stars in terms of fun.As a gamer I think the game is a buy.", "I played this for maybe two hours after I got it.  I envisioned this fine tuned wand like action and instead broke down into a flailing around hoping you might hit something before you die thing.I got to what I think is the first boss, and honestly got frustrated and quit playing and haven't picked it up since.  The boss fight relied on the skills you had learned over the intro part of the first quests and since I couldn't master a couple of them, i would just get my butt kicked as I ran around flailing the move controller.I haven't had time to pick it up again as I'm playing other games, I really wanted to like the game it has a great idea but the move/motion control part of it frustrated me a lot."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08536793291568756, 0.1079944595694542, 0.10372920334339142, 0.07494501769542694, 0.09352888911962509, 0.0256057046353817, 0.13786771893501282, 0.1201489269733429, 0.11763416230678558, 0.1331779509782791]]}
