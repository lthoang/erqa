If you read my Madden 11 review, you'll know lack of multi-hit tackles; suction, morphing, and tumbleweeds have been the Achilles heel of Madden games. I figured Madden 11 would be different, but it was not. After another Madden fiasco, I decided if another Madden game had these issues, I would not buy another Madden game, ever. Well, there is none of those issues on this newest version of Madden. For those, who have not played the demo, this is what Madden 12 is all about.....Build A Franchise: This feature is VERY deep. For example, the players now have hot and cold streaks. In addition, there is a free-agent bidding systems, which gives the player a certain time and a certain amount of money to sign the coveted free-agent. Also, the franchise mode has something, which is called hot and cold streaks for player performance.Custom Playbooks: For those, who wanted this feature, look no farther! This feature allows the player to edit an existing playbook or just create another one.Dynamic Player Performance: This could be the most interesting new feature on the game. This feature shows the affects of a player's tendencies in a game. For example, if the player has a trait, such a \"\"drops open passes\"\", they are not likely to be very consistent in catching the ball, ESPECIALLY in clutch time. This feature is more dynamic in Franchise mode because their tendencies can affect how they play, each week, instead of each game. Also, you can edit these traits to your liking, when choosing to edit a players ratings.Enhanced Tackling System/Gameplay: This is my favorite feature of the game. No more motion shifting, morphing or suction animations on a ball carrier. The tackles are collision based, which means the player now has to make physical contact with the ball carrier, in order to make a tackle. In addition, location is also important to make a sufficient tackle.The hits can be extremely hard because they are momentum based. With that being said, hits never felt so good on a game because there is FINALLY no motion shifting or morphing. You follow all the way through with a hit. If your defender does not have the momentum to make a hit, he may just make an arm tackle or he might not be able to make a successful tackle, at all. Once again, location is vital to making a sufficient tackle. The multi-hit tackles are great. Each defender, who engages ball carrier, can possibly get involved in a tackle. In addition, you'll see stolen tackles, as well. No more tumbleweed animations.Throwing on the defense can sometimes be a daunting task, especially above the Pro level. You must choose your throws very carefully. The better your QB's throwing power and accuracy, the better off you'll be. Don't worry! If you do choose to play on the All-Pro level, you will not experience the constant route jumping by defenders, which you can experience, if you have played the All-American level ofNCAA Football 12. On Madden 12, defenders will sometimes jump routes, especially if his awareness rating is higher.The blocking is excellent in the game. In fact, I would say the blocking on this game is the best of any Madden title on next-gen. With that being said, running on this game is a very rewarding experience. Unlike previous EA Sports titles, the AI of your players rarely misses an assignment. Players block and immediately look for a player to block. I have seen some very realistic DL/OL engagements, as well.Graphics/Visuals: Once again, Madden has set the bar for graphics and visuals. Player's faces and uniforms are increasingly detailed and vivid. Everything you see on a players' uniform can be seen in this game. In pre-game, you'll see all 32 team specific run-outs. Then, there is degradation of players uniforms, based on the surface of the field. That is not necessarily new, but it is in the game. I WOULD say the degradation is more detailed, though. You'll see scuffs on helmets, grass stains, and grass stains on the uniform. On replays, you'll see 3D grass. I love to see the grass or turf flying up, as player's cleats go against the surfaces. In addition, you'll see animations, which pertains to certain players. For example, if Clay Matthews makes a big play, he'll flex his muscles. The commentary is still not that great, though. The halftime show is STILL terrible. I don't know why it is so hard for EA Sports to create a real halftime show.Overall, Madden 12 is not perfect. However, it is a step in the right direction. If you have been disappointed in past versions of Madden games for next-gen, this is version should make up for the disappointment.\"", "I have played Madden for a long time... it seems to get better each year because of the graphics and gameplay. This game, to me, is better than Madden 2013. I like some of the features other reviews described but after a few games I put it up for a month, then play it a few more times and repeat.", "\"I don't want to write a long review. It actually isn't necessary. Madden 12 has most of the same game modes, and the online is littered with teenage trash-talkers and quitters. The game itself has attrocious load times and is extremely glitchy (one glitch is hilarious--finish a game and skip through the sequences, eventually you'll come to a screen where all the players are popping a squat and staring at each other). I've haven't owned mine long and my game has frozen three times. I hate that paranoid feeling of \"\"Did I save?\"\"It's sad, though, because they really don't need to do anything to make Madden better, since they own sole rights to producing honest to life NFL games. So until the license runs out we're going to get the same game every year until 2K can get back into the mix and force Madden to get better. And, to be honest, that's the only reason why I recommend this. If you want a football game this is really the only option, especially if you want to play with your favorite team. Beyond that, it really isn't a good game, for the problems stated above (long load times, glitchy, same boring modes, and not-so-fun online play).\"", "I have to tell you i did not like madden 11 but i love 12 i like the way they have the new menus and you can play a superbowl game of your choice and have fun NOW THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL MADDEN NFL 12", "WOW!  I had to start my review with that, after playing every madden for the past 20+ years, this really took a leap forward.  First off, smart defenses, no more cheezy screens for huge gains and leaving people wide open on defensive suck in plays, where QB is running all around the backfield to create openings down the field. Improved graphics and animations, but the best part is the running game!  Great blocks downfield and being able to actually run is awesome!  For the first time ever in a madden game, I find myself running more than passing.  The defenses have really smartened up, I find I am in alot of defensive games going into the second half with single digit scores.  Franchis mode has made some additions, however I havent dove into that yet(mainly online play).  All in all, this is the most challenging and realistic madden yet, and I recommend highly!  I hope this helps someone and watch out for my Redskins online.", "Not much has changed in Madden land.  Overall a pretty good football game, but I have run into a bit of freezing.  Online mode is fun, not too much lag.  The be an NFL Superstar mode is fun.  I've spent most of my time lately developing different position players and moving them up the ranks.  If you haven't bought Madden in a few years I would recommend it.", "No love. This madden is terrible. It's a completely different system from madden 10. Every pass is contested and it's very easy to throw interceptions and get sacked on all-pro. If u can master this game and it's new system, kudos to u but i just couldn't adjust. I am done with madden. Fun game to watch but playing it gives me headaches. even audibling out of plays have changed. If you have madden 11, u might be able to adjust faster, but do not buy this game if your last madden was ten. This game is overrated along ith 2k12.", "Let me start with a couple pieces of background...I love football, both college and pro. I have been buying and spending many, many hours playing both NCAA and Madden football for 8+ years. Now then...I didn't have much interest in buying Madden 12 due to basically getting the same game year after year. I've grown tired of spending $60 on a game that hasn't been worth $60 in about four years. The only reason I had bought the game the previous four years in a row was for updated rosters, new game modes, and slightly improved player model graphics. For some reason I thought this year would be better. Madden and EA sports are pros when it comes to getting the hype machine running at full steam!Here are some of the highs and lows I have noticed so far.Good-Graphics for players and stadiums are clean and crisp-Franchise and Superstar mode have enough new and improved tweaks to keep you busy-The bidding system is awesome!-Lots of realistic tackling animations-Not every single pass that hits the hands the defense is interceptedBad-Commentary, are you serious? This is beyond a major step back!!!-Loading screens froze on me several times, mostly in Superstar mode-Menus are unresponsive and sluggish at times-Linebackers will knock down every pass you throw that comes within eight yards of them-The intros for each team running onto the field, hard to believe how much they tried to hype that-Common sense?! I won a game today 21-14 and the player of the game was a Cornerback with 0 tackles, 0 interceptions, 0 touchdowns. Where is the common sense?You might be thinking, those things you complained about are not that big of a deal. These are just some of the things that have been annoying me about the game that should have easily been fixed by EA. Will we see DLC to fix any of these problems? NO, not while EA is the only game in town!Madden 12 does not completely live up to the hype. If this is the first Madden game you have ever played then you will probably love it. For the rest of us that have bought it every single year this is by far the most disposable installment in the games history. If you must get your 2012 football fix then I highly suggest buying NCAA 12 over Madden 12. Or simply wait six months and buy Madden 12 for $20-30. 3  stars...if you bought this game for strictly online play or Franchise mode then 4 stars.", "\"I hadn't played Madden since that abominationMadden NFL 2006came out. That game was the worst sports title I've ever played and being a 2K Sports fan, I was a little nervous about jumping back into a Madden game. I boughtMadden NFL 11recently and was sort of enjoying it but I noticed I was winning - a lot! And by a lot! This was after kicking the difficulty up. It felt really arcadey, almost like a NFL Blitz-simulator. Long story short, it just wasn't a football sim.Because of Black Friday, I was debating on picking this Madden up. It looked a little better in videos and I heard it fixed a lot of glitches from 11 while adding some new ones. After I patched the game, I can safely say this is a huge improvement from '11! I'm not even talking graphically, I mean the game actually plays a lot better. Instead of being in All-Star difficulty, I had to kick it down just to get a TD.The graphics/animations are a ton better that make the game look a lot more realistic. Seems like they're working a bit with Euphoria physics. But one thing hasn't changed: Commentary. It's awful. I'm really not certain why they still call this Madden since he's nowhere to be seen. But the guy doing it from 11 and 12 is \"\"teh suck\"\". It's programmed wrong too. Several times, I ran into delays from the commentary which just made the presentation feel cheap. For example, I'd kick a field goal from 40 yards, he would say I barely nailed the FG when in fact, I hit the pole and it bounced back. I wouldn't get the score unlike some of the garbage I've seen in '06.Personally, I haven't ran into any glitches outside of commentary.If you're wanting a decent football game, Madden 12 is it. It's got some goofy moments (all commentary related). It's still slightly arcadey in some areas (WR seem to have sticky hands when catching the ball a lot of times) but I'm having a blast with it. I'm already on my 8th game.\"", "I have not played Madden in a long time. I understood that because there may have been a lock-out this game had features not presented before..not sure what they meant by that ? Anyway like always they change things from what worked and what did'nt and still never keep the real good ones and Add most of what people ask for....I enjoy this game but like all sports games when you play at times its like you are pee-wee players and the CPU is the Pro's....then you have to in the middle of the game turn it off and wait and play later ( I guess that is true in most sports games, well the ones i played anyway) But over all, i like the game and they took out the speed boost sort of thing i noticed, and now unless your just plain fortunate you can get to the line and through a hole before the entire defense stands there waiting on you to get the ball. I also noticed far to many dropped passes on offense and especially on defense...balls in your hands but can not catch it. And the worse of all I see all the time when you light up the player to make the play he normally runs away from the opposing player ( example- would be )-> If he catches a long pass and my DB is close and I light him up to intercept or to make the tackle, when I light him up his first movement is away from the opposing player..and an immediate tug on the stick is needed and mostly that little shutter causes you to miss him and worse he always runs 3 times faster then you do...one of those moments you shut the game off in mid play to settle it down and you go back later and play and it does not happen as often.[ is that built in to drive you carzy or what ? a Madden joke maybe ?] Anyway in honesty, its fun to play and the graphics are great, the commentators are really boring and the same lines over and over well its madden I guess we can not expect anything more. I gave it 5 Stars for fun , but only 4 Stars for overall...simply because of those same nagging gliches that drive you crazy, especially when its a close game and its near the end and your winning by 3 or something and nothing you do stops his passing or running, and you can not tackle and or sack the QB even when you run over him and even with double coverage his guy always catches the ball and runs through your guys and runs 3 times faster then you can and when you light your man up he runs the opposite way and the CPU scores no matter what .....yelp...its normal Madden game .", "\"First, a disclaimer:  For those that have played Madden since the PS2 generation, I think the best two are...PS2:  Madden 2005 (and indeed, I think this is the best one period)PS3:  Madden 2010 (play 2012 and go back to 2010, the presentation is so much better)Which brings me to Madden NFL 2012.  I hestiated to buy this until my wife made the suggestions, who am I to argue?  I had heard things about the \"\"Dynamic Player Performance\"\" and all the other improvements, so I said what the heck?First, the good:- The game is looking great graphically.  They've nailed the stadiums (and indeed, a lot of the intros), the menus are sharp and easy to read, and overall it's more polished then other PS3 Maddens.- GameFlow returns but for someone like me who has played with the Steelers for many years, and knows their best plays, it's nice the conventional option was left.  I was up and running in no time even though it had been many months since I played Madden.- The online community/matchmaking process has been significantly improved and the trolls/cheaters that have plagued this game online for years is likely to be all but eliminated, so kudos for EA for finally getting this fixed.Now, the not-so-good:- I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this game, and let me tell you that they nailed one thing:  The announcing is HORRIBLE in this game.  A few examples:*I'm up 35-0 and they go \"\"The Ravens better do something on this drive because if they don't, man it's going to be a long day\"\".  You think?*TWO times I know i heard Gus Johnson refer to my offense as the DEFENSE...how in the WORLD does that get in a final product?You would think in 2011 they could get this right...but no.  It still sucks.- While the graphics are good, the actual game performance leaves somethings to be desired.  Clipping is rampant (not the football penalty), a couple times in my first game the crowd (cardboard and pixelated as it was) got in front of the players on a cutscene, they play the SAME cutscenes after a guy scores a TD, I mean I could go on and on but this stuff should be fixed by the 2012 game now.- The difficulty has some seriously wild swings that are either way too easy or ludiciously difficult.  Is it too much to ask to have a nice middle ground?- This might be the easiest set of sport game trophies to earn on the PS3.  I got SIX of them in my very first game!  And the only ones I see that are majorly difficult are the ones that require 100 yard returns for TD's.  Past games have had a lot more specific challenges and they had to be played in All Pro...these can be earned on any difficulty level.- It was tremendously easy in Madden 2005 to manage your Franchise (players, etc.) but this interface is way too clunky for its own good, even with all the details they added.  Sometimes simple presentation is MUCH better.- Why Madden went away from what they had in 2010 (i.e. the halftime show, etc.) is beyond me.  The lame excuse they have in its place (a couple random highlights) is a joke.  Oh, and I guess Gus Johnson couldn't be bothered to say the teams NAMES when he says what the score is at the end of every quarter!  I have NEVER seen that in all the years I've played Madden.And in the end, EA doesn't care.  They know there will be a significant part of the population that will pick it up just because it's the next game in the series.  Games like NHL 11 (and upcoming 12) have advanced and are now far superior to the NFL product, but of course Madden's going to sell like hotcakes so they don't care.So, if you're someone that likes the updated rosters, and can appreciate the few improvements they put in, go ahead and buy it again.  Just know what you'er getting.  I don't see this game drawing any new players into Madden who haven't played it before, and Madden's got a long road to climb back that we probably won't see until the PS4/next Xbox generation.\"", "I don't think I'm the only one that misses Visual Concepts/ Sega Sports 2K football. You can if you'd like, but I'm not feeding giant EA sports any more cash", "The gameplay could use some improvements but I really enjoyed the improvements to franchise mode and I love ultimate team.  EA did a good job of updating the rosters too.", "\"Each and every year I tell myself that I'm done with Madden. And what do I do? I get suckered in and buy it. But this is the last time, I traded it in, this is the first time I ever traded in a Madden game.I remember playing the franchise mode with every single NFL team, and having a blast. This game has consistently went downhill for years. The franchise mode sucks, plain and simple. I couldn't even make it through week 8, I just couldn't take it anymore. Don't get me started on online gameplay.....Reasons why Madden 12 sucks:1) Where is the half-time show with highlights during franchise mode? How do you have the audacity to call this 'real football' but you're too lazy to implement a half-time show, yeah that's real football.2) Why is the franchise mode interface so darn confusing? It's so much work to navigate around the franchise mode menu just to look at things like 'stats'. If I'm done viewing passing yards leaders and I want to look at rushing leaders, I have to exit out and go back in again, why? On NFL.com I don't have to do that.3) Why is it impossible to complete a pass to a WR running a deep post? Although Madden has tons and tons of passing plays, there are only a few that are actually worth running. It's impossible to complete a deep post in this game. It's either batted down or intercepted. If you have ever played Madden, you know what I'm talking about.4) Why do I get sacked EVERYTIME I play-action pass? This has been the case for the past few years, attempt a play action pass, and you'll get sacked 1 second after you finish the play fake.5) Why does just about every deep throw end in an interception, broken up, under throw, over throw, or thrown out of bounds? (notice that completed was not one of the choices) If I'm playing online and I see cover 0, I'm going deep to Megatron because it's man to man with no safety help. If I throw it 10 times to him, he catches 1, yeah, that's the way it happens in the NFL.....6) Why does everyone online use the exact same defense? If you've played online, chances are that you've ran into the infamous cover 0 defense. The best way to combat cover 0 is to throw it deep. Well, not in Madden 12. First of all, if you try to run a regular pass play against this cover 0, you're sacked. If you run, you're stuffed in the backfield. If you run a pitch outside, you may gain a couple of yards. If you throw it deep, like you should, you won't complete it (see #5)7) Why do I disconnect from the EA servers and get charged with a loss even though it's not my fault? This problem has plagued Madden online for years and continues with Madden 12. There is nothing more frustrating then being up 31-3 in the 4th quarter and BOOM, lost connection..charged with a loss.8) Why do I feel like Im on roller skates when playing defense? I usually play with a CB and it's hard as heck to cover WRs in this game. I understand momentum, but this is ridiculous. It's impossible to cover a WR man to man, even if you have Revis. If their WR makes a cut, your momentum takes you in the other direction as if you're on roller skates or something. Not fun playing as a defensive back....9)Why did everyone that gave this game 5 stars, only write 2 sentences about it? Go into detail like the 1 star reviewers do. I'm just saying...If this game is so great, give us something more than \"\"This is the best Madden on Earth\"\". Tell us why.10) When are we gonna wake up and realize this game will never change for the better as long as EA has exclusive rights to make it? I long for the days of 2K5, I'll leave it at that.I blame myself for this, I need to stop buying the game. Perhaps I've finally learned my lesson.\"", "\"Each and every August the video gaming public is treated to the new Madden football game for the year, and with just as much consistent frequency, the game is presented with a few tweaks, a few screw-ups, and a few totally useless add-ons.  Madden 2012 is no different, and for the most part the game works great with a few glaring mistakes.What works well for Madden 2012 is, thankfully, the actual gameplay.  EA always attempts to throw new gimmicks at us with each new installment, but thankfully a lot of the updating and improvements rests with the mechanics of the actual game experience.  The first noticeable attribute is the tackling and blocking.  Never has Madden been more realistic in this area with the players following all the way through with their blocks and tackling completely on the player with the ball.  The animations and movements are very fluid and realistic for the most part, and when you make a tackle on someone he will fall the way it feels like he should.  Gone are the clipping and magnet-like actions of tackling where a defender would somehow sidestep five guys with one breath and make an incredible tackle amidst a gang of six players.  This is something entirely new for the franchise, and though it took some getting used to, it definitely is a feature that is most welcome.Another facet of Madden that has been improved upon from last year are the receivers keeping both feet in bounds for the catch.  Last year's Madden did a fine job of correcting the age-old annoyance of players running out of bounds to make a catch, and this year Madden has made it even better and more realistic.Graphically, the game is marginally better than last year, but Madden 2011 looked great anyway, so the slight improvements really look polished.  The reflections in the helmets, the facial expressions, and the on field movements and footwork look very detailed and extremely realistic.  When Desean Jackson scored a touchdown against me and they showed his face close up, I was stunned at how accurate he looked.  Really good work.Most of the features from last year are still here such as the deep franchise mode and the option to use the Gameflow system or conventional play-calling.  For those who don't know, Gameflow is basically when the computer calls your plays for you.  This feature is useless to me as I only play Madden to be my own creative self, but thankfully it's just an option.Something that has marred all Madden games in the past is the ability of the computer to come back in the third quarter and slaughter your offense.  With old Madden's, the game would become possessed if you got a lead on the computer in the third quarter, and it would simply cheat in order to even up the score.  That doesn't happen with Madden 2012, and it's yet another cool attribute that has changed this year.  Another annoyance that is gone is the action of throwing ridiculous interceptions whilst getting sacked.  In Madden 2011, if you were in the process of getting sacked the ball would shoot into the air and, of course, into the arms of a waiting defender.  It would never go into your hands, always the defense.  Moreover, it was totally unrealistic.  In Madden 2012, when you get sacked, you get sacked.  No balls shooting into the air, and no CPU's taking advantage of weird developer placed glitches.Despite so many things that make Madden 2012 such a highly playable experience, there are some brand new issues that have made themselves evident, and it will really make you wonder if the Madden franchise will ever be able to get everything right.One of the maddening things this game franchise does, every single year, is spend far too much time making changes to peripheral things that no one cares about.  The kick meter, for instance.  Every single year the developers feel it's necessary to change the kicking meter in some way.  Why do this?  Are people really clamoring for a new kick meter each year?  This year's kick meter is the worst it's been for years, as well.  It starts off slow, then goes fast, then slows down again, with the gauge being this weird crescent-moon shaped orb which makes it slightly difficult to tell what the hell is going on.  The kicking meter was perfect two years ago.  A straight bar across, push the buttons, and you're golden.  Instead, the developers are obsessed with changing it, AGAIN.Madden 2012 is unique, though, for its introduction of some new and improved problems to go with the new improvements.  The first issue you'll run into is the clunky play-calling process.  In the past, when you selected a play, then changed your mind and went to a different formation, your previous entry would still be selected for you to more easily navigate.  This year, if you want to go backwards in the play-calling setup, it will take you back to the top of the play-calling system making it tedious and time-consuming to get back to where you were in the first place.  For instance, if you call the shotgun formation, then navigate halfway down the list to the \"\"spread\"\" execution, then change your mind and go back to the shotgun formation, it will take you to the top of the shotgun formation instead of leaving you at the \"\"spread\"\" execution.  Every single Madden in the past would take you right back to where you were before you called a play, but now you have to thumb through all the options a second time.  With the play clock moving, this can get really annoying.Another odd thing about the new Madden is waiting for the computer to take kicks.  When the CPU scores and comes in to make an extra point, a full ten seconds will crawl by before the CPU actually makes the kick.  Hurry up and kick already!  What's the holdup?Another pointless addition this year is the on-field intros to the players and such.  Yes, it makes it more realistic, but does anyone really care about this?  I find it hard to believe that many Madden players are jonesing for new intros and fanfare to their favorite video game football team.And, once again, the commentary is no less than awful.  It's intriguing to think of why EA can never seem to get this issue right, but the commentary is, as always, late, pointless, and completely ingratiating.  Chris Collinsworth's snarky delivery has always been amusing and entertaining, but Gus Johnson has got to go.  The guy is just terrible.  One of the typical things he'll say is \"\"he caught that for the first down, didn't he???\"\"  Uh, yeah, genius.  Are you watching the same game I am?  One of the most irritating things Johnson will do is get all excited about absolutely NOTHING AT ALL.  Yeah, yeah, I know that's his schtick, but gimme a break already.  He'll say things like, \"\"THIRD DOWN AMD SIX TO GOOOOOOOOO\"\" or just make sounds like a barn animal.  Wow, really?  You're gonna get excited about that?  Keeping my fingers crossed that EA will axe his completely useless behind.  More than that, though, the commentary is just late.  You'll throw an 80 yard touchdown bomb, but if Collinsworth and Johnson are busy rambling on about something completely irrelevant they will stop at nothing in order to finish their aimless diatribes.  The most exciting commentary you'll hear is when the CPU makes a great play.  This only proves that the CPU knows what it's going to do before you do, making it kind of tough to follow along with the commentary.Without question, the biggest annoyance with Madden 2012 is the superhuman ability of every opposing middle linebacker you will face throughout your season.  You will soon learn, after playing three or four games against the CPU, that you will not be playing against defenses, but playing against one single middle linebacker who will block every other pass, make every other tackle, and make amazing glimpses into the future and call each and every route your receiver runs.  You'll be amazed with what each MLB, regardless of skill level, is able to accomplish: jumping five feet in the air to make an interception, one-handed grabs, one-armed tackles, and just the general ability to suss out whatever it is you'll be doing.  I had called a slant play and the hot route was to the slot receiver.  The MLB slowly crept over to the slot guy, knowing he would be the hot route.  I called an audible to my running back, and all of a sudden the MLB crept over to the left to cover the route of the running back to the other side.  How would the MLB know this?  Quite simply, he wouldn't.  This is the single biggest drawback of the game this year in that, no matter what you call, you have to be ready to take on the MLB.  He will just omnipotently KNOW what you're up to.  What this indicates to me is that the computer obviously knows what you're calling and the code writers of the game have heaped all of the defensive challenges on one player.  That's all fine and dandy, but when you're taking on one player instead of an entire defense it gets very unrealistic.  It seems as if the developers have done this to make the game more of a challenge, and while this game is the most challenging it's been in quite some time, it makes these changes in trade of realism.  When you check the stats at the end of the game, the opposing MLB will have 30 tackles, an interception, and a sack.  Kind of ridiculous.When all is said and done, there is much to like about Madden 2012.  I would give this game three and half stars if I could, but I think three stars would be too harsh in light of Amazon's rating system.  What ultimately rings true about this game is that it can't decide where exactly it's going.  It's trying really hard to appeal to the hardcore Madden pros, like myself, by making it more challenging and less flashy.  At the same time, it really wants to woo new amateurish fans by including things like Gameflow and adding useless peripherals like extended team intros and highly annoying commentary that would only be helpful to an 8-year-old.  It's trying too hard to be something for everyone and cutting corners to get there.  Any Madden fan is going to see that Madden 2012 is a slight step backwards for the franchise despite some nice improvements.  One thing EA needs to learn is that you don't always have to make changes to something that already works.\"", "Madden NFL 12 is a great football to have. If you like the other Madden games..you will like Madden 12.", "I bought it because Toys R US was offering a $15 dollar off deal and the improvements seemed legit.I have been an above average supporter of madden. I own 04-07 for ps2. I bought 08 on ps3 and was disgusted by EAs lazy port and inferior visuals. Bought 09 because they fixed this for ps3 but stopped playing after awhile because it wasnt as much fun as it could be. By that year, I realized what a joke next gen madden had become. I quit buying them. I only played one game at Walmart. So I never bought 10 or 11 and from what is sounds like I didnt miss much. My complaints of next gen madden are similar to everyone elses. I hated the weird/slow run animations, terrible graphics, cheap AI, and generally boring experience. Well, I played the demo and all of these things were fixed and I was pretty happy and surprsied. The throws felt a lot snappier with a nice speed to them. The scrambling and running were a lot better looking with foot planting and a good sense of speed. So I bought the game and ultimately now feel dissapointed. Why?1. The single player gets boring. I dont know what it is. Its either too hard or too easy and every match feels the same no matter what team you are playing against. THis is probably due to the fact that only high profile players look like themselves. Everyone else mine was well be rosie o donnell because there not enough close. MLB the show runs laps around madden in this way and NBA 2k12 is better to.2. New team entrances are a joke. I can't believe EA hyped these up so much. They are the same every damn time and add nothing to the game. The camera angles also look like tv, but not because they are the same exact angles EVERY TIME.3. Franchise mode is improved, but almost ruined from the awkward menu system and the improvements are not as fun as they sound. Firstly, the menu works where there is normal menu so you click on something say rosters. Well, in older games (and every other game ever made) this goes to a seperate screen where it shows your options. Here, it opens another menu in the main menu! This dosnt sound so bad, but it becomes somehwat of a chore flipping through all the options which you will do a lot in franchise. You can press R2 and L2 to switch between the main menu items. If you just press down, it will automatically go through the sub menus. But even with R2 it just feels slow. Ok so awkward menus arent so bad. Well some of the improvements are just no fun like the 75 man roster. Really, this just makes more work for you. They make it sound great cuz you can have more players on your team in pre season. However, most of these players you have are suck players you would never want anyways. As the pre season goes on, you have to make a certain number of cuts each week. Its just a chore you have to do as you scroll through your roster cutting the fat out. The game teases you with this mode by giving players a potential rating. Hey they could be good!!! Well some players dont have this so you dont know what their potential is. However, they may have a good rating, but these fluctuate every cut week. All in all, the mode is made to keep extra players to find that diamond in the rough, but its so simplistic and left up to chance, its just not fun and becomes a franchise duty. After that I dont know about the franchise, I never tried the free agency bid because the game itself is not that much fun to play.4. The game is not that much fun to play....alone. But the online is downright frustrating at times. Be ready to deal with madden cheasers who call the same play over and over. Fast players are always the best and the game becomes  button mashing fest calling audibles to set up your defense to cover flats and slants.5. gameplay is weird. Throwing the ball is near impossible with average qbs. Ball never goes where you want it to. Its never high enough (jumping linebackers still present) and too many long throws go out of bounds. The running is improved but not amazing.I realized how much i didnt really like this game after renting nba 2k12. I know its an entirely different sport, but these are sport simulators and 2k12 (mlb the show) are just way ahead of madden. That is the truth. The graphics in madden are improved, but still not as good as 2k12 or the show (ps3 version also looks more washed out than xbox, another port). There is no such difference in the nba version for ps3. The comparisons between nfl 2k5 and madden are inevitable but warranted. NBA 2k12 was developed by the same publisher and design team as NFL 2k5 was. So just look at NBA 2k12 and image that in football form and how good it would be. Then, look at madden 12. You have your answer to how good this game is.P.S. I have this game a fun rating of three because it does have its moments especially if you could play with a friend. However, nfl 2k5 is still fun to play to and I also have that game. I ultimately regret buying this though despite the deal i got on it. Its just not that much fun after awhile when you realize where football games should be at this point."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07494868338108063, 0.0822426900267601, 0.07305920869112015, 0.08372224867343903, 0.04064891114830971, 0.05760589987039566, 0.0426165796816349, 0.04153868556022644, 0.009077680297195911, 0.06251967698335648, 0.06576625257730484, 0.0036609256640076637, 0.09358268976211548, 0.008865724317729473, 0.045873306691646576, 0.0789380818605423, 0.13533282279968262]]}
