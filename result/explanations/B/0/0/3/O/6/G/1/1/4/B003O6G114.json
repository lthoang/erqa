This charger is GOOD.This being said, there is BETTER. We got thePS3 Move Quad Charger. For about the same price or sometimes less the Quad will charge twice as many Move controllers (two Motion and two Navs) AND comes with 2 USB ports that you could use to charge 2 DualShocks or just about anything else that you would charge through a USB cable. Not to mention the great design.Knowing what I know, after experiencing them both, I'd be getting the Quad if I wanted a Move charger.", "I purchased this item along with the move bundle pack and must admit, it is a must have for any move owner. Since the new PS3 slim only has two USB ports, it is kind of hampered in what it can charge. This station is the best way and most convenient to charge the move controller(s) (if you have two) without having to leaving the console on. In my experience, it takes about 4 - 6 hours for initiall charge, then about 2 - 4 afterwars depending on how dead the controller is. Overall, it is a great item to have coupled with the navigation controller or move bundle. Definately worth, however, I should note that 3rd party developers are making charging stations that can charge up to 4 controllers at a time, so that might be something of interest for those who may have multiple controller (i.e a family).", "This a a great Product i am glad PS 3 done something to overcome the Wii stuff. This product works Great and is far beter then any other i have seen.", "Its Sony! This is the best charger for the move controllers and I love the small and beautiful design. Before buying this one I bought a 4 ports charger and its sucky compared to this one. Save money and just buy this one.", "This charger is great.  First of all, it looks really nice.  It has a nice glossy finish on the top with a really good shape to it.  As a charger, it does what it's supposed to without any problems.  After being let down by the terrible Nyko Wii Charger, I vowed to never buy third party accessories ever again.  Sure, the Nyko Move charger has 2 extra ports, but it most likely sacrifices quality in all facets compared to the official Sony Charger.", "This is just a must for the move, its great to just let your controllers charge without having to turn on the PS3.", "Now that I had gotten the PS3 Move motion controller and navigation controller the only problem I had was when the power died out on these two,  and while you can charge them through the usb port via the PS3 console I found that a little aggravating since if I'm not playing any games why should I have the PS3 on just to charge these two controllers.  Now with this separate charge station for the motion/navigation controller that problem is solved,  you can charge either the motion/navigation controllers or two motion controllers since they hook via the usb ports on the controllers and since their for the most part cylindrical there's no difference in their over all shape for any problems with the charge station. The charge is very well done giving a strong connection between the charge station and controllers so there is no worry of not getting a fully charged controller when it's over,  and yes while there are more charge stations coming out in the next month or so for $30.00 dollars and to keep you mind at ease I feel most people will find this a very good item to have for their PS3 move gaming console for now...", "While I haven't seen my move controllers go dead even after hours of use. This is nice to have because you can have your PS3 off and still have a way to charge controllers. very easy to use, nice long power cord. Simply plug it in, set it on a flat surface, and drop controllers in. The red light stops blinking once controller is charged. If you have the move, this is a $15 add-on that is worth it.", "Quick question! How easy is it to charge a Playstation Move Controller (either kind) without a docking station? Not easy, is it? It rolls around, falls on the floor, your dog eats it, then you have to clean up glowing poo in the back yard... ok, maybe not that last part, but you get the idea. And, while I had a dreamGEAR charging dock that had room for one Move Motion and one Move Navigation Controller, but since I had two Motion controllers, this posed a problem. Thus, I browsed around online and settled on the Sony Playstation Move Charging Station.ConstructionThe Sony Playstation Move Charging Station (henceforth referred to as the PMCS) is constructed from heavy-duty plastic and includes an A/C charger which plugs into the back of the unit. The two grooves have a contact at the bottom to charge the controller once it is seated within the unit.PerformanceThere is not really a lot to elaborate upon here. Simply put, the PMCS functions as it is designed to; plug it in, pop in your two controllers (note that the ports can charge both the Move Motion and Navigation controllers interchangeably), and anywhere from a half-hour to an hour later and you will have a charged (set of) controller(s) ready to go for a gaming session. With the flexibility to charge either controller in each port, you will always have whichever device that you use most often at hand!So, What's the Verdict?If you have more than one Sony Playstation Move Motion and/or Navigation Controllers, this charging dock becomes indispensable. It keeps your controllers upright and stored neatly, and can accommodate two of the same or one of each of the controllers for charging. The ultimate in simplicity, you just set the controllers in the grooves in the dock, ensure that the dock is plugged in and getting juice, and let it go! What more could you ask for?", "I've been using this charging station for 3+ years, it's a quality product from Sony.The power cord length is PERFECT. It measures at just over 8.5 feet long, and the charger doesn't need to be connected to the PS3, so you can place it wherever you like.You can chargePlaystation Move Motion ControllersorPlaystation Move Navigation Controllersin this charger.It shuts off when charging is complete, so the controllers can sit in the ports until you're ready to play.The only thing missing is an external USB port to charge up aPlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller.Highly recommended!", "Using the cord really place too much cords all over the place when I am not using the PS3.Soi got this place it ina nice spot it works great every time i finish using the contorllers jsut put it in the stationa and it starts charging no hassle. The red light flashes when cahrging when is not hte unit is then charged."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1429298222064972, 0.16766543686389923, 0.0769902914762497, 0.15025694668293, 0.09318046271800995, 0.02027413249015808, 0.0023393898736685514, 0.08065902441740036, 0.12757505476474762, 0.057295192033052444, 0.08083423227071762]]}
