In Little Big Planet 2, the most major changes are the new Creatinator, Controlinator, Grabinator, and the Sackbots.The Controlinator, in my opinon, is the best. It lets you control an object that you create. You use this a lot in the story. In the story, you use it for flying bees, controlling a hamster thing, controlling a dog, controlling a bunny and much more. Using this in community creations lets you almost do anything.The Creatinatior is my second favorite. It is a hat that lets you shoot stuff from a small cannon on the hat. You control this a similar way to the paintinator, but instead of paint, it shoots anything you want it to. You use this in the story by shooting cakes at monsters and walls.The Grabinator lets you pick things up. It is very simple. You pick things up and throw them around. In the story, you use this to pick up and throw bombs, jelly, cake, and other players. The story even has a basketball level, where you have to throw a ball into the hoop. Speaking of the basketball level, This brings me to my next subject.Versus Levels are very fun when you have two people, but they can be annoying or boring when you are alone, so this game is much better when you have a friend to play with.Sackbots are always fun, but it is hard to find a way, in my opinion, to use them in your own level.If you are interested in this game, get it the first chance you can, because this is a very good game.", "The first LBP was a unique and fantastic experience, this sequel surpasses an already great game and it is a goty nominee for this year.The collectors edition packing is great, the book containers are neat and the sackboy quality is pure awesome, everyone want to take him out of my room, it is lovely. The extra costumes are great great aswell, the whole package is worth the money.The user interface is great, the implementation of pins and trophy progress was a good desicion to make, definetly much better than the first game, visuals are little much better aswell.I have finished and aced all story campaing, Media Molecule did it again offering a bunch of expectacular levels with pretty unique ideas, but what steals the show is user generated content, some community levels are too professional, doesn't seems like if they were done by users.This sequel also maintains LBP bases, you can play up to 4 players locally or online (although I found many connection problems trying to play online compared to the first LBP), the new tools added to build things are out of your mind, this game is pure awesome and a MUST BUY for al PS3 GAMERS.PROS----+ Visuals+ Fun+ Presentation+ Soundtrack+ User generated content+ Story Campaing+ Multiplayer+ Infinite possibilities+ Backward compatibility with LBP1CONS----+ Some issues connection to others onlineIM EXTREMLLY PLEASED WITH THIS GAME!", "\"I am going to review this a little different than my normal reviews as if you owned LBP1 you pretty much know the gameplay, graphics, sound etc.  This review is going to be broken down into 2 parts.1. The Game itself2. The CE box edition____ THE GAME ____Okay Little Big Planet, if you have not played it before, is pretty much a platform'er w/ some adventure and wonderful creativity thrown into it.  The game is suitable for all ages and has almost infinite re-playability.  When you finish the campaign not only do you have item collecting to do but online user created levels, can create your own levels, dress up your pod, play mini games or redo the campaign with up to 4 people and have a blast just enjoying yourself.LBP2 made some changes to the formula which I think gave it a much stronger campaign.  While the levels early on can be a bit annoying or challenging (due to the grapple gun mechanics) the game as a whole is very polished and boasts a fantastic sound track, some really good and funny voice acting.  They implemented a more solid storyline this time and it gives each level a lot more meaning to it.  The new versus levels are a lot of fun also with friends.The online play is extremely fluid, hopping into random games or inviting friends is even easier than the first game.  If you loved Little Big Planet this game will easily bring a smile to your face once again.  If you loved to create levels in little big planet, LBP2 will blow your mind with what you can do.  You can recreate games like pac-man, asteroids, street fighter, even play a game of basketball; the versatility of this game is never ending.If you never played Little Big Planet but were very curious about it, this is definitely a title worth picking up.  Next to the Uncharted series, LBP is easily one of my top titles released on the PS3.9.7 / 10  ( 97% ... 5 stars ) for the game.  There are some minor bugs that aren't game breaking but can cause that happy smile to turn into a frown for a few moments but not enough to hurt this game.  I expect many of the little problems to be patched out within a few days as these are just your typical launch bugs____ COLLECTORS EDITION _____Now... I am going to review the collectors edition.  Essentially, is the CE worth +$20 ?  Lets review what you get with the CE first1. Book/Game ends (60%)** These actually are much better quality than I expected.  They do not feel like cardboard at all but I have a feeling they are probably heavy duty cardboard w/ plaster coating over it. They seem far to light for the material.  However, they do work quite well. I have tested it with a bunch of games and they hold just fine.  They also do a good job holding a bunch of books; though small books like paperbacks such as Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time  etc  Each end has small rubber/felt feet(4) on it and I think here is the problem with why people are having issues with them.  They dont' have enough \"\"grip\"\" to really hold these ends in place.  On a smooth surface like my polished PC desk they slide far to easy and a simple bump would cause it to lose its hold on the books.  Replacing the little felt feet with solid plastic/rubber would resolve the problem but overall, out of the box - these kinda-sorta work.2. 5 PSN avatars (50%)** What can I say, they are PSN premium avatars.  Nothing special honestly and they don't even look that good IMO3. Jax and Daxter exclusive costumes (100%)** These are exclusive to the CE.  The costumes look fantastic in 720p with high detail put into them.4. 11 DLC costumes (100%)** Who doesn't want more costumes!  Depending on pricing when the hit official DLC  it can be $6-$11 in savings (technically since you are paying $20 more for the CE)5. LBP2 game disk (100%)** Of course you get the game silly!  At least you better have a game in the box ^_^6. 7\"\" Plushie (collectible) (50%)** If you don't already own a sackboy / sackgirl plushie then this might be worth having as they do sell for anywhere from $10 - $30 depending on the quality. However they are all usually 10\"\" in size not 7\"\".  This is pretty much a smaller version of the standard plushie you find anywhere.  From the original pictures included of the box set when announced they showed a completely different , higher quality Sackboy plushie.  It was the first thing I noticed also was that this wasn't the advertised Plushie in fact it is all over the internet, in these reviews, my friends pointed it out also.  Is this a killer, not really as you still get a cute plushie!  Its just a bit of a let down as well as slightly misleading pictures/advertisingANYHOW as you can see , in my book  the CE scored 2  100's  2 50's and a 60  so doing some math that's 72%  (i'm not including #5 in the calculation for obvious reasons :) )72% is pretty low in my book for a CE box set. (C- aka.. BARELY passing)  With that said:*** The CE is a PASS.  Do not spend $20 on this unless you honestly want a 7\"\" plushie for the kids (or to add to a collection or something) and some bookends that sorta-kinda-maybe work half the time 0_o  the costumes are really nice though but I'm sure you can end up buying them as DLC later on. Save your money\"", "The game has changed a lot since the first one. Lots to do and create. It is the most fun game I've played in a while. The graphics shine and the frame rate does not drop a bit. A must have game for any LBP fan.The collectors edition on the other hand....a huge disappointment. It's only saving grace is the DLC, but that alone would not justify the higher price.Let me start with the sack boy figure, a total rip-off. What you see on the box is FAR from what you get. The sack boy colour is different, it is a chocolate brown; it's also stiff, not at all soft and flexible as the box art makes it look. The eyes are small and the zipper is painted on with a plastic handle. Poorly and cheaply made. This is a prime example of false advertising.The Bookends are made out of cartboard, glued and packed tight enough to give it a false sense of sturdiness. But they are cheap and couldn't hold more than a few games together, forget about actual books or games in tin cases. Again, a rip-off.The only good thing out of the package, besides the game itself, is the DLC offered. Lots of costumes and some avatars. So, if you want some all the DLC currently available, get the CE, but if not, save your money and buy only the DLC you want later on; the CE is good IMO, to get all the DLC now,  but don't expect much more than that. It was a huge let down for me, to the point that I will now think twice before I buy a CE of upcoming games.I was going to give a five star rating, because the game is good, but CE is too much of a let down.", "I'll save the actual review of the game and focus more on this special edition of the product.I have read that a lot of people were unhappy with the Game Ends, or Book Ends, or whatever you want to call them.  I am not one of those people.  Although they aren't quite as heavy as I anticipated them to be, they do the job that they are intended to do very well and look really cool doing it.  I really like that I've been able to take the few PS3 games that I've got and stash them all together on a shelf with these things.I also really like the included Sack Boy stuffed toy.  He looks great, just like Sack Boy in the game.  He's definitely the type of toy/figure that I love to have sitting on my video game shelf for display.The DLC that comes with this Collector's Edition is also really cool.Overall, I'm glad I got this version instead of the standard version.  It's got some cool swag in it, especially if you're a fan of the series.", "\"LBP 1 has been my son's favorite video game, even more than halo or mario kart.  It's the one thing we always go back to.  And it's the only reason I bought the PS3.  For that one game.  And I never felt ripped off, since it was worth it, the game is so enjoyable on so many levels, especially with a young child.  And it's still the only game I have for the PS3, until now.This one just takes it to the next level.I love the grapples.  So much more playability and complexity now.My 7 year old had an initial rough time mastering them, but is happy with them now.Graphics are ramped up, better views in many places, and the changed types of gameplay are just awesome.  I can't wait to see what kind of levels people end up making with this engine.  We only got about half way through the first game's levels, since we spent all our time online searching for fun things.Others have gone into great detail about the pros and cons for the collector's edition.  My .02 is that the sackboy is cool, but my mother already made my son a couple of foot tall sackboys, so the smaller, stiffer one in here wasn't something I planned on him glomming onto anyway.  I'm planning on hanging him from the rear view mirror of my smart car as my \"\"navigator\"\".The book ends are alright, but again, not very well made.  Like a very firm foam, about the consistency of balsa wood inside, covered by the colored paper with the designs printed on it.  But part of the charm of them is that they are very much like the game itself, the pod - kind of made to look like it was cardboard and such.As others have said, the DLC is where it was at.  I wanted the extras that will only come with this, since my son loves changing all the costumes he can.So for the extra $20 for the bookends, figure, and costumes and such, for me was well worth it.Now back to the game, and looking forward to all the hours of enjoyment it's going to bring both of us.\"", "I just got my CE and I have to say I'm more than pleased. I payed $18.47 more than the regular edition to get 11 costumes right out of the box, two very cool bookends that I will display, and a sackboy that *does* look like Sackboy. The bookends aren't pewter or something, they're made of a weighty fiber, however, and look very nice. I honestly love them.The Sackboy doesn't look 100% like Sackboy as you would think he would, but from reading half these reviews, I thought he was going to pop out of the box having sprouted a second head. It is a cool looking piece of memorobelia indeed. And you can't go wrong with all the costumes. Things like that cost anywhere from $1-$5 to DL on PSN for these types of games which would set you back almost the extra cost of this CE alone. Notably, the Sackboy by itself costs $19.99 to purchase, more than the extra cost.Bottomline is I think people expect way too much. Did you expect $100 bookends like the LOTR Golum ones you can buy from the Noble Collection? I mean cmon...You get what you payed for and $18.47 is not going to break the bank enough for me to complain. In my eyes, there isn't anything to complain about anyways. I think they did a fine job with this CE and it is well worth the little extra scratch. Now I'm off to play the game *bobs head from side to side*"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08256155252456665, 0.19010834395885468, 0.26455050706863403, 0.021967798471450806, 0.17297270894050598, 0.026922356337308884, 0.24091669917106628]]}
