I like the option of removing the piece off of the hood for extra lighting. Solid product. Buying a second one.", "I ordered this hood for my K-x 18-55mm kit lens, it fits well, easy to attach and detach.  I ordered new but when it arrived it didn't look new, oh well it's not glasses, only a couple of bucks, what can I say?", "I really hadn't thought much about these hoods but after buying a new lens where this type of hood was included, I had to get some for my other lenses. I had been using the collapsible rubber hood type and may continue to switch back and forth. I like that this one has the bayonet mount so it's easier to install and remove than the screw type.", "This lens hood does not fit the Pentax K-50 SMC DAL 18-55mm AL WR lens or the standard 18-55mm kit lens that comes with the K-50. The hood does not match up with the tabs on the lens. I could not twist lock into place.The one I need to get is the Pentax PH-RBC 52mm. This one is for the PH-RBA 52mm.I thought it was misleading when Amazon was recommending this lens hood with the K-50. Time for me to go on Ebay instead.", "It probably came off the same line as the official Pentax item, and sells at a fraction of the price. Came quickly (using Amazon Prime).This is a bayonet sytle hood and does not attach via the filter ring thread (that's a good thing). The bayonet style hoods do not interfere with mounted filters or a lens cap, and can be stored backwards on the lens for travel in most camera cases. The only improvement I could wish for is if the manufacturer had placed some white paint in the molded indexing mark. That would make attachment slightly faster.", "just wanted to write a quick review to let everyone know this indeed fits a Pentax K-x DSLR and is much cheaper than the official Pentax brand hood. Fits well, looks good, cheap!", "Use on my DAL 18-55mm pentax kit lens.  Works just fine for me.  Very cheap, very nice, do not hesitate to purchase", "I lost the hood for the Pentax K-7 18-55 WR kit lens on my second shoot, thought this might fit, but no. It is not as pretty at the original, but it would do just fine if it did. It lacks the index line that helps to line it up.", "Item as described. Nothing really to it, but it does the job well and for a fraction of the cost.", "It's kind of loose it does what it has to do but it easlsly  falls off I wish there where something that can be done to secure betterNEW UPDATEI WAS NOT PUTTING ON RIGHT YOU HAVE TO SREW ON  TIGHTLY  TILL IT IS PARELLE WITH LITTLE REMOVABLE WINDOW IT STAYS ON VERY SECURETRULY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS HOOD.", "It fit my camera as I expected it arrive on time for the purpose I need it for. the price is right"], "Gamma": [0.13618919253349304, 0.13618919253349304, 0.13618919253349304, 0.13618919253349304, 0.13619127869606018, 0.13632328808307648, 0.04653940349817276, 0.13618919253349304], "Beta": [[0.1953258067369461, 0.013115039095282555, 0.0030389325693249702, 0.20935745537281036, 0.006226232275366783, 6.746601138729602e-05, 0.0669914186000824, 0.0021568224765360355, 0.1892646998167038, 0.1883663684129715, 0.12608984112739563], [0.1953258067369461, 0.013115039095282555, 0.0030389325693249702, 0.20935745537281036, 0.006226232275366783, 6.746601138729602e-05, 0.0669914186000824, 0.0021568224765360355, 0.1892646998167038, 0.1883663684129715, 0.12608984112739563], [0.1953258067369461, 0.013115039095282555, 0.0030389325693249702, 0.20935745537281036, 0.006226232275366783, 6.746601138729602e-05, 0.0669914186000824, 0.0021568224765360355, 0.1892646998167038, 0.1883663684129715, 0.12608984112739563], [0.1953258067369461, 0.013115039095282555, 0.0030389325693249702, 0.20935745537281036, 0.006226232275366783, 6.746601138729602e-05, 0.0669914186000824, 0.0021568224765360355, 0.1892646998167038, 0.1883663684129715, 0.12608984112739563], [0.19532528519630432, 0.013116714544594288, 0.003039724426344037, 0.2093541920185089, 0.006225857883691788, 6.748786836396903e-05, 0.06699066609144211, 0.0021573761478066444, 0.18926498293876648, 0.18836617469787598, 0.12609152495861053], [0.19530850648880005, 0.013169392943382263, 0.0030631187837570906, 0.20925751328468323, 0.00621198071166873, 6.812530773459002e-05, 0.06696759909391403, 0.0021737527567893267, 0.18927708268165588, 0.1883605420589447, 0.12614241242408752], [0.1977255940437317, 0.010012094862759113, 0.003993825055658817, 0.21315783262252808, 0.009079431183636189, 9.35577554628253e-05, 0.06366685032844543, 0.002735289977863431, 0.184650719165802, 0.1894344538450241, 0.12545032799243927], [0.1953258067369461, 0.013115039095282555, 0.0030389325693249702, 0.20935745537281036, 0.006226232275366783, 6.746601138729602e-05, 0.0669914186000824, 0.0021568224765360355, 0.1892646998167038, 0.1883663684129715, 0.12608984112739563]]}
