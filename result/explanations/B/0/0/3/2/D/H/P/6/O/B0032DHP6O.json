After reading some of the less positive reviews, I  made sure to double check everything.  The set is attractively packaged in a compartmented, easy-to-pack leather-look roll that seems to be well constructed with no loose or faulty stitching.  The  brushes all feature a flat bottom so that they will stand and are firmly attached to the handles.  The three larger brushes have bristles made of mink hair and are very soft, while the smaller ones are made of badger hair.&#9654;&#65038; I paid particular attention to the larger brushes, checking them both before and after cleaning for shedding bristles.  The bristles all seemed firmly attached.  The large Kabuki brush is particularly nice.The manufacturer recommends that you wash your brushes before you use them for the first time.  While there are special makeup brush cleaners that you can buy, Shany recommends ordinary shampoo.  Many makeup artists also use conditioner when they clean with shampoo.&#9654;&#65038; Either lay your brushes on the counter with the bristles hanging over the sink so that the brush does not flatten during drying or lay them on a towel, turning several times to preserve the shape.  (You can also use a blow dryer.)Grandma's $0.02 - TheSHANY Studio Quality Cosmetic Brush Set, 7 Piece with Bagis a nice, well made set of basic cosmetic brushes.Recommended", "these brushes are awesome quality! you can't beat it!
