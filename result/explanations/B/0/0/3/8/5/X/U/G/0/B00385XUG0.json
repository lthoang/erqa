I wore out the fast forward button on the first after about 3 years.  I did some searching and could no find another reasonably priced remote that would allow custom programming of switching my amplifiers inputs along with device selection.  It is also easy to setup a multi-device power on/off button using the system control buttons.  Others allow having the volume control dedicated to the amplifier as this one does but they don't have the input switching.  The old remote is still fine except the worn out fast forward button.  We dvr extensively so the fast forward is used 4 or 5 times more often than any other button.", "Other reviewers commented on the difficulty of programming this remote, and I have to echo their comments.  The &#34;SET&#34; button is awkward and difficult to use.  If you don't do the programming exactly as described, and in the very specific time frame allowed, you have to start over again.I bought this for our guest bedroom where we have a DVD player, DirectTV and an older flat screen TV.  The older TV programmed after only six code attempts, and I had to walk through all but one of the codes for the Direct TV player.  Can't there be a manual that has codes by model #?  I know that should not be a major complaint, but it's a little annoying to 'test' eight codes before you find the right one.A word of caution:  While some reviewers note they use this for Roku, the newer Roku players are Bluetooth, not Infrared.  This device will not replace a Bluetooth device.", "This remote would be a 5 star if it worked properly.  The issue.....  Won't learn.  I am on my second remote and the learning function does not work properly.  I have a Yamaha receiver that I am trying to teach the new remote to use, but it only learns a few buttons and won't learn others.  The crazy thing is that the first remote learned different buttons than the second so something is up with the software.  The other issue is that this remote is far more difficult to put into learn mode than the earlier RM VL600. C'mon Sony........", "I love this remote. The layout is well thought out - for example, the volume keys fall right under your thumb when you hold the remote. I've programmed in most of the keys from these devices:&#34;AMP&#34;: Sherbourn PT-7030 preamp/processor&#34;BD&#34;:  Apple TV 2&#34;TV&#34;:  Panasonic PT-AE3000 projector&#34;DVR&#34;: X-Box (for Windows Media Center)You can program the volume keys to always go to the same device, which is really nice. I had to read the manual to figure out that some keys are not valid for some devices (e.g. you can't program the MENU key for a VCR).The IR output from this remote is STRONG! I also installed a Niles infrared repeater this weekend, and I can stand at least 15 feet away from the sensor before its LED stops blinking.PROS: great layout, well-written manual, strong IR signal, huge memory, learning mode works well.CONS: not backlit, and the device buttons could be a bit larger.", "While this programs ok, it wouldn't accept any programs for a PS3 (I use mine to watch blu rays mostly, as recent games like Madden have been a disappointment), and if it had a light it would be better. I'll be looking for a better multi control.", "WE have two VL600s and when we bought 3rd TV, assumed that we would get another. But now they sent us this one. If you have never had a 600 or 610, then you might love this. Great remote for the buck. But it is not nearly as easy to program as is the earlier remotes. More buttons and more steps to assign each. Took twice as long to set up. But once it is set up (recommend using the learning function to do it) then it is  a pretty slick remote which rivals those costing 3 times as much. Just dont lose the original remotes and keep the instructions handy. (which are pretty easy to read)", "* The feel of the buttons: Perfect...plus NO sounds or clicks when you press a button.* The remote is programmable (buttons can be taught new functions).* Works even with my Air Conditioners at home (through learning function).* Works flawlessly with Apple TV2 (through learning function programmed in BD appliance; does not program in DVD appliance).* Easy to explain to Parents, nannies, guests...much different than Logitech Harmony remotes (which are fantastic, but for the home-owner/technology-aficionado only).* Low cost to replace WHEN (not if) my daughters break it.=> Only real problem is you cannot copy one Sony remote and all programmed buttons to an another new Sony unit completely...you have to re-program the other remotes.  I have purchased a total of 3 units and simply did it patiently since it was worth it.", "\"I've used prior generations of this device for many years, with my most recent model being the RM-VL600. No one would ever accuse Sony of making any of them easy-to-program, but the RM-VLZ620 is virtually impossible. After spending at least 30 minutes attempting to get a single set of device commands programmed, I have three major complaints:The RM-VLZ620 refuses to even enter learning mode if it does not have brand new batteries in it. And they'd better be right-off-the-conveyor-belt new, too, as it is ridiculously strict about this. You won't know what's going on, because no part of the manual--not even the troubleshooting section--mentions it, but you'll select the button you want to program and the \"\"SET\"\" light will just turn off. No blinking sequence to look up or anything. Just silent failure.Entering programming mode is also an utterly bizarre incantation of button pushes and holds that take a really long time to perform. This matters a lot more than you'd think it would, because unlike all previous models, the RM-VLZ620 resets itself after every learning operation. If you forget to go back and re-select the device button before you select the next button you want to program, you'll exit learning mode altogether and be forced to repeat the aforementioned incantation to get back there. In practice, this happened to me about every other button, and by the time I managed to get it back into learning mode, I had forgotten which button I had left off on. This is just stupid.The RM-VLZ620 is hands-down the least effective \"\"learner\"\" in its family. It fails to read other remotes' signals constantly, forcing me to repeat the learning process over and over again before it actually succeeds in learning. My ancient RM-VL600 almost never fails to pick one up under identical conditions, and it's been dropped so many times it barely even stays together anymore.Once it does manage to tell you it succeeded in learning a command, it has significant problems actually re-transmitting them. A single, brief, completely normal button push more-often-than-not registers as three or more button pushes on the thing you're trying to control, and there appears to be nothing that can be done about this. Again, never had this problem with any previous generation.On to more nitpicky things, there's no \"\"Exit\"\" button anywhere. I can't find a single remote in my house that doesn't have an \"\"Exit\"\" button as they are usually quite necessary for navigating on screen menus. Instead, Sony gave us a \"\"Favorites\"\" button where \"\"Exit\"\" should go. I have no idea what the point of this is.Yeah, it's cheap, but my aging RM-VL600 was about twelve bucks, and it actually works.\"", "I don't know if I got a bad remote or what, but I couldn't get the learning function to work.  I tried for over an hour and tried putting new batteries (two sets) in the Sony remote and in the ones I was trying to get it to learn from.  My older &#34;All for One&#34; remote was able to learn from these so it wasn't a matter of incompatibility.  The batteries were bought this summer and good until 2023.  Gave it two stars because the codes worked for most remotes but I like to customize mine.  If learning is important to you I would try another model or different brand.", "\"I have been searching for the best affordable universal remote over the last few weeks and after trying out several other models that I didn't like, I settled on this one and am very happy. I even tried two different Logitech Harmony models, and while the setup was pretty cool, I just wasn't happy with the performance (delay/lag when pushing buttons, sending too many commands to devices, not to mention the terrible software).Here are a few cool features that I like from this remote:- Automatic input switching when you switch modes. For example, you can set it so that when you click the DVD button, it automatically switches the TV to the DVD input. This feature alone makes this remote awesome. It's like a simplified version of Harmony \"\"activities\"\", but it's more consistent and easier to use (which my wife appreciates).- You can set the inputs to use the volume from a specific device. For example, you can set the DVD player to use the TV's volume. Or you could set the TV and DVD player to use a receiver for controlling the volume. You could do this manually using the learning feature, but the volume button repeats like it should if you set it up using the built-in method. Plus you don't need the original remote, which is a plus if you've lost it or something.- Macros, which allow you to save a series of button presses in a specific order. This means you can have a single button that turns on the TV, turns on your DVD player, and switches to the DVD input. It's very much like Logitech Harmony activities, but at a much lower price. For comparison, the $30 Harmony allows one (yes ONE) macro/activity. This remote supports 16 of them.This remote also feels nice in hand, is very responsive, and has enough buttons that you can fit pretty much anything you might need on there.The only con for this remote is that the setup is a little more complicated than the other remotes that I tested. That said, you only have to set it up once, so if you set it up right the first time you shouldn't have to mess with it again. I'd rather have a slower initial setup and a better remote in the long run. I'd take a star off for this, but I honestly don't know how else they could have provided all the setup options they do without having be a little more complicated than other learning remotes.Bottom line: if you want a fully featured universal remote with lots of configuration options and you don't mind reading the manual to get it set up then you'll love this! Highly recommended!\"", "Had a pretty easy time setting up all of my devices. Worked with everything from an old TV and DVD player to a brand new LCD and blu-ray play. My only complaint is that some of the more important buttons that I use often are just as big as some of the buttons I never press. This is not a reason to not get it. Would get it again if I lost this one. Great buy and great price.", "This remote had no problem learning all the commands from my Windows Media Center remote. I have yet to see a universal remote that already knows the WMC commands so I needed a remote that can learn them. This one did the trick. It also balances well in your hand and feels pretty durable. I've had mine 2 years (since May 2010) and it looks good as new. I'm so happy with this unit that I bought 2 more for my other TVs. Other perks are that you can assign buttons to a sequence of commands so you could turn on your TV, amplifier, and DVD player with 1 button press. I also like that it uses AA batteries rather than shorter lived AAA ones. Even if you don't need the learning capabilities this is a great universal remote.", "Easily hands down the best universal remote I've ever owned, no question. We have two now. They are solid, easy to program, work well out of the box and seem to blast the signal all around the room. The equipment seems to work no matter where you point it.", "So this is a cool remote. It can control tons of devices, not just Sony. It does my Magnavox TV, Scientific Atlanta 8300 Explorer cable box from Cablevision and my LG DVD player. It does it all!", "the only potential downside is the lack of backlighting... which (for the price) doesn't strike me as a huge negative.  this thing works great for Sony devices and its surprisingly easy to program for all other devices.", "IMO, this is the best remote Sony ever made.  Ergonomic and fully programmable for around $20-25.I especially recommend this if you have several Sony components, although it is easy to program.", "Everyone should get an extra remote, even for new TVs, stereos, whatever. Why? Because it's always good to have the original remote to use if needed. I've used universal remotes for years now and they are invaluable. I found that my original remotes would wear out, malfunction and develop non-working buttons.Sony's universal learning remote is the best one I've used. Its learning ability is unsurpassed. You can teach each button any command you want. I like to teach each device select key keys(individual keys) some of the same commands to control the same functions on my TV. What I mean is, I will set the cable select key to operate my cable box and (using my TV remote) teach some of the keys to operate the specific functions of my TV that I know I will also want to control. What I found superior with the Sony remote is it does not limit the learned keys you can program. I tried GE, RCA, and URC learning remotes where all of these could only learn a limited number of commands and then would not accept any other learned commands. For example, the URC-WR7 is limited to a total of 80 learned commands. Also, this Sony remote has more teachable keys than any other remote I tried. For each device (component) button there are 50 teachable keys as well as 4 system control keys. Each system control key can learn up to 16 consecutive key commands.In functionality, I think this Sony remote is 5 stars. Very good IR range, precise operation and enough keys for most all operations. What is lacking is it's a bit difficult to teach (program) keys. You need to hold set until lit, press the round center button to hold set mode, then press 988 to enter key learning mode. Now, you choose (press) which device select button you want to teach keys, press the key you want to teach and then press the key on the (original) remote which you want to learn from. This wouldn't be so bad if you can just cycle through each key you want to teach except you must, again, first press the device select button every time to want to teach another key. Another (minor) negative is the keys layout...The number keys are on the bottom being a little difficult to hold the remote and press more than one key without it feeling like the remote may fall out of my hand.Overall, I think this is the best learning remote for a reasonable price. There are many pre-programmed devices (components) to choose although it may not be your perfect choice if you don't have your original remote. The URC remotes seem to have more pre-programmed choices but, if you want to fully teach your remote to your precise key commands, this is the remote to get.FYI: A few programming tips include not programming in direct fluorescent lighting or while a plasma TV is on. These may interfere with the IR signal. Also, you should try (test) programming a few keys at 1 inch versus 2 inches face-to-face distance to see which best accepts your key command(s) correctly. Another thing I figured out is you may have to press your original remote key fast or possibly hold it for a moment (especially for volume keys) to get the Sony remote to learn the key function the way you want it to operate.", "I bought this to operate all Sony products and while it will work the TV, it DOES NOT operate the Sony Home Theater or Blue-Ray Player. I am really surprised by this and consider this a complete waste of money. I have taken the batteries out and restored it but it still does not work anything but the TV. That is pretty bad I think since this is a Sony remote", "I have a Sony TV but recently purchased a Samsung Soundbar and didn't want an extra remote laying around.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this remote matched the layout of the remote that came with my Sony TV which I was already familiar with.  While this remote did not include the codes for my Samsung Soundbar, the learning function had me up and running in no time.PROs+ Solid build quality+ Triple IR Blaster: it is very frustrating trying to type a channel number and only having one or two of the numbers register.  The three beams from this remote ensure that every button press registers properly.+ Programmable volume controls: Even if the remote is in TV mode, you can program the volume buttons to always be controlled by another device (in my case, the &#34;AMP&#34; which is the Samsung Soundbar)+ Learning function: if you can't find the code (or don't have the patience to look them up), you can use the device's original remote to program the codes into this remote.CONs- Awkward programming: hold this button until it blinks, then continue holding it while pressing another button, then enter a 3 digit code, but before the light goes out, press this button... it seems a little overly complicated to program, but it is doable.- Some Sony keys seem off:  although this remote comes pre-programmed to operate Sony devices, I did notice some irregularities.  For example, the &#34;List&#34; button actually controls the Closed Captioning function of my Sony TV.", "Bought this to control our home theater.  I use it to control my Apple TV, Sony TV, Moxi DVR, Yamaha receiver and Panasonic Blu-Ray player.  For some (Sony TV) it was pretty straighforward, for others, I needed to have it learn functions from the original remote.  It replaces most functions, but not all.  I still need to pull out the original Yamaha remote to do some tasks, and when entering numbers for channels, it often double enters (press &#34;1&#34; and &#34;1&#34; for 11, but get 111).  After using it for about 3 months, my wife and son are still asking me how to watch a movie.", "\"I was looking for a simple Universal remote to consolidate the remotes for my girlfriends new TV, blu-ray, and old cable box.  A $75 Logitech Harmony was recommended to me, and while I like them I wanted something simpler and much less expensive, and likely much longer battery life than the Harmony (which needs to be recharged regularly).  This Sony 620 has done nicely.It's fairly easy to program, though my girlfriend couldn't have done it.  Once very nice feature is the \"\"input switching\"\", where you can assign a function to the device select keys that causes IR codes to be sent when the device is selected.  So I set it such that the TV switches inputs depending on whether \"\"cable box\"\" or \"\"BD\"\" are selected.Really the only problem I had was that her remote for the cable box had an \"\"On Demand\"\" button which there was no mapping for on the Sony.  I tried to \"\"learn\"\" it, but after a number of failed attempts I realized that the \"\"On Demand\"\" button was actually just a macro button that sent the IR commands for \"\"1\"\" and \"\"Select\"\", to cause it to go directly to channel 1, where the on demand channels are.PROs:Simple (once programmed) and inexpensive.Has reasonable features.Long battery life.CONs:Doesn't include batteries, luckily I remembered to buy them.  Many devices come with them.I found the manual sometimes awkward to use, phrases that were hard to follow.\"", "Seven years ago, I bought my first Sony universal remote control RM-VL600. It was a nice powerful remote, but lost its look in just a few months. Last week I finally got rid of it, and bought this new one. This one is much more comfortable and well balanced in hand. They have really put some thought into the design of this remote. There is even a thin soft plastic line infused around the edges which helps on grabbing the remote and hold it firmly in hand without worrying about accidental slips or drops.I only have one problem with this remote. I have yet to find a way to learn the menu key of my Comcast xFinity Cisco box. No matter how hard I try, it doesn't learn that specific key, and needless to say there is no predefined code for this device. However, I have had enough universal remotes over the years to understand that some IR sequences are not learnable. Another issue that you may have is that it doesn't have a backlit. It didn't bother me, but based on your preferences, it may be a deal breaker.I think this remote is a big step up from VL600. It is easy to hold, and feels comfy in hands. If you don't mind the lack of backlit nor the rare occasion of the remote not being able to learn special keys, then this will make a nice addition to your setup.", "If this remote had the colored buttons it would have been perfect for what I needed it for.  I have been getting Sony universal remotes for years now.  The main reasons are for the learning feature and the macros.  These are a must.  Sure you could put in a code for your device, but I like to use the learning function because I know it will work the way it should.  If you have more than a TV, then the macro buttons are a must.  It is nice to be able to push one button and have the TV, amp, and bluray player all come on at once.  And also have the volume buttons only control the amp!  I would spend a lot more money and get one that you just plug into your computer that would do all that for me, but if you are like me and have kids, you know how quickly it would be lost/broken/soiled.  This remote worked just fine for my needs.", "Would not learn my Windows Media Center remote commands, which is the whole purpose of a learning remote (i.e., learns everything).", "This remote is a very nice universal remote, not as flashy as a Harmony but at a much, much nicer price.  Does most everything but sometimes you have to use the learning function to teach it a key that it does not automatically give you for a given device.  It is a little complicated to set it up to do everything you want it to do but it is do-able.  I was not able to use the macro functions for my system because the input select function on my TV (LG) needs to have human interaction to select the right input (cannot be done automatically).  The rest of my devices respond great to the macro programs, I don't suppose any remote could do any better on my system.  If I had spent a lot for a remote and then discovered the problem with the TV I would have been disappointed, but for this price I can at least consolidate my remotes into one.", "Nobody does universal remotes like Sony. I had some doubts after reading negative reviews, but got it anyway because my AV receiver is Sony, and I'm very glad I did. I had no problem programming my 7 devices, and most functions I need work right out of the box, especially on the Motorola DVR cable box. I was surprised to see how little I had to manually program using the learning function, which works just as well as it did on my old Sony RM-VL900. The only drawback is - the last device selected in a system control sequence is not remembered, reverting back to the pre-sequence selection, but I can live with that. Highly recommended.", "This remote has worked for all my  electronics and not I can put most other remotes in a drawer and just use this one. I also had no trouble programming this remote. I like is so much I bought one for the bedroom.", "\"This remote is well made, the buttons respond well.  Good styling.  I have big hands so I find that I can manage all of the lower half buttons (VOL, MUTING, CHANNEL) with my thumb.  My sweetie who is petite, has small hands is able to make this remote work for her too.Runs on 2 \"\"AA\"\" alkaline batteries.Major Plus:  It has 8 extra \"\"wildcard\"\" user assignable function buttons.  4 are labeled A, B, C, D  4 are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4These are good for remotes that have custom / proprietary functions that don't fit into the normal remote layout pigeonhole.That's the basic review.  I can recommend this remote.MORE INVOLVED / EXTRA INFO (beyond the basic review):We have a Channel Master ATSC digital TV tuner that works well but the remote that came with it was so cheap that the buttons didn't respond until after 4 hard presses - a lot of aggravation.Enter the Sony RMVLZ620 Universal Remote Control.Channel Master isn't on the preprogrammed remotes vendor list (bummer) * * HOWEVER * * it is possible to \"\"teach\"\" this Sony remote the commands from pretty much ANY old remote by going through a sequence of keys and placing them 1 to 3 inches apart.  I was able to do this process successfully (copying the Channel Master codes for each key function) but it took me about 75 minutes and some patience.TIP IF YOU HAVE TO DO MANUAL PROGRAMMING:  The manual process for the Teaching button functions between remotes  is on Page 20.--> Pay particular attention to Step 4 of that process &lt;--- where they say \"\"Press the device select button for the device you want to control.\"\"My advice:  Yes, you do want to PRESS FIRMLY & HOLD DOWN whichever device select button you choose/intend for that step ( i.e. TV, Cable, VCR, BD, DVR, etc...)BUT.... ----> DO SO FOR an ENTIRE 2 SOLID SECONDS.  Then the button will light up like they show in the drawing.  It took me a bit of fiddling to figure out that this is not an immediate quick tap and go process.  You have to linger on that button until the device category button lights up.Over and out.__________________________________________________UPDATE 5/16/2014  Still going strong.The only VERY MINOR quirk I have noticed is... sometimes, when raising or lowering the volume on our Channel Master TV (ATSC receiver box), at the moment we press the up/down button, the audio cuts out for like 1/4 - 1/2 a second.  It has always done this from Day 1.  The volume rocker switch is NOT defected. It's not a big enough deal to worry about.  We still like the remote, its range, it's layout and response time for everything else.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1411886066198349, 0.0003308409941382706, 0.0005754305166192353, 0.00024288319400511682, 0.00487026060000062, 0.0007748276693746448, 0.007651960011571646, 0.02365502156317234, 0.12748344242572784, 0.0022137006744742393, 0.0005171052180230618, 0.02325117215514183, 0.03821880742907524, 0.020135600119829178, 0.004055751487612724, 0.04234975576400757, 0.057675573974847794, 0.15507648885250092, 0.005858733784407377, 6.765559373889118e-05, 0.05946778506040573, 0.0003517655422911048, 0.0040763686411082745, 0.1332273781299591, 0.04205308482050896, 0.0006571970880031586, 0.10326666384935379, 0.0007060788339003921]]}
