NCAA seems to have more bugs this year on release date then previously. For reasons explained in interviews with the game's developers available online, EA Sports doesn't have the ability currently to do a large scale beta on the game before its released. Its not until the game is released to 100,000+ users playing the game that these issues are showing up. Interviews with developers said in the choice between waiting to release a perfect game no matter how long it takes and releasing a game on the deadline date with full update support after, they choose the latter. And that is the same formula EA has used for their sports games for several years now, release it at the same time each year and then patching it afterwards.But EA Sports seemed to forget who is buying their game, mostly teenage boys, who have little patience to wait several weeks for a patch, nor care that EA Sports can't do a beta and its the reason they can't ship a more bug free game. Online forums are filled with unhappy customers who have returned the game almost immediately because of various issues. It doesn't help that it takes EA Sports a few weeks to release patches. That is because they don't fix 1 thing at a time, they usually fix/tweek 20 to 30 problems and then do a QA before release. Also, they don't give many details on when or if they are going to release an update, leading to customer frustration.If you have played the previous versions of NCAA, not much has changed in either the game play or features. They have tweaked the lighting and added some of the NCAA Pro Combat uniforms. The result is that while the game isn't the eye candy ofMadden NFL 11, it does look better then previous years.Online Franchise has probably changed the most. No longer does your team have a HQ page. Instead it has been replaced with the Dynasty Wire. The Dynasty Wire has story capsules of each dynasty member's game with a minimum of 4 photos of the game that are automatically uploaded to the online Dynasty web page. You can add up to 10 photos and 5 videos from each of your games to tell the story of that grid iron battle. Afterward you can go to the EA Online Dynasty website portal and add a story to each game's uploaded highlights. An editable headline and description is automatically generated and added added to the uploaded photos from each game. Every game from every season is available at the online website while in the game you can look back at the current season's game highlights and stories. Along with that, you can create a story using photos and videos from any of the previous games, including photos and videos from games from players that no longer are in the franchise. You can also post an update to Twitter or Facebook linking the webpage of your game's story and photos for all to see.Season Showdown is different now in that everyone is in it vs. last year where you had to sign up for it. The result is that people that don't care about the effects of negative sportsmanship points (from going for it on 4th, running up the score, etc) bring down the ranking of schools with fewer people playing who have chosen that team as their favorite.Overall, they have fixed most of the issues of the game since its been shipped. The one issue they are still working on is the lack of enough player progression each year. People complained last year that the way players progressed, over a few seasons, the number of A rated teams swelled unrealistically. This year they went too far the other way trying to fix last year's issue and the way the game was initially shipped, after a couple of seasons, there no longer were any A teams. They have put out a couple of fixes to work on that issue.  There is a new way other then patching to adjust certain aspects of the game called Tuning. While it can't do major fixes like a patch, its cool that they can tweak many aspects of the game faster now via the built in Tuning feature. Several Tuning adjustments have been released in an effort to perfect player progression.ProsGame Play is pretty solid, especially when compared to how Madden 11 was initially shippedThe new Online Franchise up-loadable game story and highlights feature brings realism to the game as well as the ability to look back at every game form every year.The game looks better then in previous years along with more realistic ESPN integration, its more like watching a real gameTeam entrance films show the rituals that some teams have before every gameEA Sports has made more of an effort to get team play books closer to realityOnline ESPN content, and during the season, weekly college games recaps by a couple of the game's producersExtensive website that allows you to do many non-game activities such as edit and create new storiesAlthough it may take a few weeks, EA Sports issues patches to fix the gameConsReleased with enough bugs to make many return the game (most are fixed now)Probably the worse rosters to ever ship with an NCAA game (thankfully, they are editable)EA Sports keeps its customers in the dark about updates on upcoming patches/tuningThe website is not perfect and I do not recommend it to do recruiting because often glitches in the website will end your call earlyNo updates to offline usersThere still are reports of people having problems with connecting to others for franchise games as well as commissioner's not being able to access their dynasty, but seem to mostly be fixed.You have to pay for extras, like the ability be the commissioner of more then 1 online dynasty, for everything, its a whooping $29.99!Overall, its the better playing game between Madden and NCAA this year. The environment of the game is more realistic then last year. Most issues are fixed via the patches and tuning. The bad rosters are fixable, websites like Operation Sports have user names of PS3 users with better rosters. If you enjoyed last year's NCAA and even Madden 10. you most likely will enjoy NCAA 11.", "So again this year I got NCAA Football the day it came out and again I wish I would have simply waited a month. When Madden comes out the price of NCAA always drops and there is nothing in this game that really makes the extra month of play time worth it. I've played a lot of games so far in both Road to Glory Mode and Dynasty mode and really there is nothing that special upgraded over last years installment.Road to Glory mode is my favorite mode right now because you can play entire games in less then an hour using 15 min Quarters. The scores are still outrageous if you do this but I always liked playing longer games.My biggest complaint is paying $60 bucks for a repackaged game from last year. You will notice small upgrades to the graphics and announcers comments but really is this worth full price? I guess that is really up to the eye of the beholder. I personally regret the purchase, I like NCAA better then Madden on the next gen systems but I really wish I had the patients to wait for the price to drop upon Madden's Release. If you are a huge NCAA fan this is of course a must buy but if you are a little tight on money go ahead and wait for a price drop. JUST REMEMBER ONE THING WHEN WAITING.EA has again stuck the online restrictions on this game to help kill the used game industry. Do not buy USED if you want to play a dynasty online you will have to pay more then the difference of buying a new version making the game actually cost more to buy used.", "\"First and foremost, let me state that I am a sport fanatic and that's not limited to college football.  Like 99.9% of sport games available, the yearly copy is simply a rehash of the previous year's game plus a few new gimmicks (EA is obviously the King of this).  I am not much a of Madden player, however, as I prefer its college counterpart because I find an enormous amount of fun in recruiting.  And it's in this field that EA seems to make players' lives difficult in the sense that they make it harder than it has to be.  This year, I can say with a clear conscience, recruiting has taken an ENORMOUS step in the right direction.Let me continue my review in the form of bullets, rather than paragraph form.PROS:-Recruiting now takes a mere 10 minutes per inquiry/pressing of a certain pitch, offering a scholarship, scheduling a visit, making a promise (which can now be done IN season), negatively recruit against another school, etc.  In years past, pressing a certain pitch could take way too many minutes from your 10 hours of recruiting time.-Recruiting takes on a game-show-like twist.  Recruits will now ask you about certain pitches rather than the other way around.  Once they pick a topic, you can either \"\"make a pitch\"\", \"\"ask them how they feel about it\"\", \"\"compare to another school\"\" (aka negative recruit), \"\"Change the topic\"\", \"\"make a promise\"\", \"\"schedule a visit\"\", or \"\"offer a scholarship\"\".  I don't know if this is considered a PRO, but it's a breath of fresh air for this central cog in the game.-You can change the \"\"recruiting difficulty\"\" if you don't want to keep saving and redoing certain weeks of your dynasty if a certain prospect keeps going to another school.  This is nice because sometimes I don't want to lose all the 4/5 stars to the SEC...-The \"\"Locomotion\"\" game play engine is a large step towards achieving game play comparable to the KING of football games, Madden.  In years past, the movements of the players were \"\"jerky\"\" (can't think of a better word), while this year this game offers a much more fluid football.  You'll know the difference once you pop the disk in your system. Personally, I'm pretty satisfied with the actual game play.  It runs smooth and tackles/catches all look exceedingly accurate.  The graphics are really beginning to utilize the full capacity of the PS3 system and I can only hope that EA builds on that rather than maintain it for the next few years.-Unique entrances for each team.  I think this is a gimmick on EA's part just to say they added something new to the game but for people who go to BCS conference schools (I'm an Oklahoma Sooner, myself), you will definitely enjoy this added feature.  You've got every thing from the Wolverines running under the \"\"M CLUB Supports You\"\" Banner, to the Clemson Tigers touching Howard's Rock before running into the stadium, etc.-Unique offenses.  College football is innately different from its pro-counterpart because of the unique offenses the majority of schools play.  This year, such offenses are highlighted.  From the triple-option at Georgia Tech, to the no-huddle at OU, to the Pistol-set at UCLA, etc. It certainly gets boring running the Pro-set for every team, doesn't it?-The entire interface of the game has been retooled and again, this is a huge breath of fresh air for loyal fans of the game who have to see the same things year in and year out.Cons:-The \"\"Pay-to-play\"\" recruiting features are STILL here and it's awfully annoying because they include the options among the other FREE features and I suppose sometimes I forget it's not free and end up clicking on it (sorry for the run on sentence).  They call them \"\"time-savers\"\" but paying on top of the $60 + tax you pay already?  At least with the Map add-ons for COD MW2, you play them every other game so you get the most use out of it.  The features EA makes you pay for are just side features that would surely enhance my satisfaction were they included.-At the end of the day, if your preference is for the most realistic football experience, you cannot look towards an NCAA game for it.  I know I said this had great game play, but it's obvious that EA saves the best for Madden, as millions of more people would prefer the NFL.  Which makes one wonder how good Madden 11 will be...-Same old commentary...... wish they would completely revamp that.-Each team still only has one unique (if at all) TD celebration.  It would be nice for each team to have multiple interpretations of their respective celebrations (i.e. V for Victory/USC, the Gator Chomp, etc.)-I've noticed that there is A LOT of lag when scrolling through options in dynasty mode.  I don't know if everyone else out there is going through the same problems.. my PS3 is not even a year old yet and it's the slim line one so I doubt its my system.-More to come??  After a few days of playing, I haven't seen anything else yet.  And I will update as I see them!THANKS FOR READING!\"", "\"I purchased this game and all was well for the first month.Out of the box it was probably the best NCAA game I can Remember since 2004-2005. Very consistant (No wicked rubberband EA is known for), fairly realistic and competitive on All American Difficulty. Well, EA Decided that this year they are going to do LTPs (Live tuning package)to \"\"fix\"\" parts of the game that they notice are out of tune.Well as this idea sounds good on paper As of Aug 11 patch 2 was released and well what this does is seemingly takes a great game and makes it a toss up between this and NCAA 2007 current gen (Consensus worst edition ever). Now pretty much the game cheats in order to make it a close game, if you are losing you will avg 20 yards per carry and catch every pass, If you are losing you will get the run stuffed and you will miss wide open passes. This is not rubberband ai this is more like a see-saw AI. It is not that it is harder it is much less enjoyable when I know that 1st down I need to run, then on second I need to call run and audible to play action to get 15 yards. The AI is still easy to exploit but the game is now soo broken you are limited to what plays you can pick. I would say wait to see if they fix the before you purchase it , because this game is not fun as it stands.  I will update this and give a better score if they fix this. If this is how they leave off I will be pretty much done with EA.\"", "\"The best football video game I've ever played was Madden 10, even though I've always LOVED playing the NCAA game as a big college football fan.After Madden 10 was released and I played it into submission, I thought I would never go back to NCAA. I thought the 09 and even 10 versions of NCAA fell flat and were bland.NCAA 11 fixes all of that. After only a short week of play, I've totally gone back to the NCAA bandwagon and this is the best NCAA game yet. The graphics, and particularly the animations are the best the series has seen. The gameplay is super solid as well, making it challenging but not cheap. You can chose any type of play style or playbook and play anyway you want and it all feels legit and smooth.The dynasty modes are slightly unchanged but have a new interface which I think is again the best yet.I'm playing the online dynasty with a group of friends for the first time, and being able to recruit online from your P.C. to your online dynasty is an amazingly fun and addicting obsession to help you kill time during a lunch break or during Chemistry 101.While I am debating owning both Madden and NCAA in the same year (Have heard great things on Madden, including the addition of Gus Johnson doing the announcing) I am not debating getting Madden as a replacement for NCAA for the first time in three years.Madden might have to wait its turn.(EDIT: After playing it more and more the shine is starting to wear off. It isn't nearly as good as Madden 10, in my opinion, though the setup of recruiting, both online and offline dynasties is FANTASTIC and the best yet. Very visual and easier to follow along with.That being said, I have a major problem with the passing because it is so uneven. Some routes take forever to develop and your line, no matter their skill and if it is max protection, just don't give you enough time to execute.And many times I've fired a bullet to my WR, and out of nowhere a DB, who is not even on the same side of the field or aware of the fact that I'm throwing it to A DIFFERENT receiver than he is responsible for somehow makes an amazing break on the ball and flies across the field to knock it down. BS.There are ways to make the game even and fair, but that way is NOT to make the AI be superman.If this just happened once in awhile I would be ok with it... but, sheesh, it happens once a series or more. Not acceptable.After playing the Madden 11 demo a few times Madden is much more legit and fair in terms of not having \"\"superman\"\" on the field.\"", "I love ncaa games. They added more excitement to football. Having the ability to run options with the quarterback and running back make the user more involved. These games require more skill than madden. In madden, you can get lucky by throwing he ball up and for some reason they'll catch it. This game is more realistic but the graphics are much worse.", "Now i am not a huge football fan on the consuls. im not really that great at them but i did pick up ncaa this year. the last ncaa game i had was 08 i think. the think i didnt like about ncaa from when i played in the past was that you could run the ball constintly and get yards like crazy and your players would really ever make amazing catched. this year it seems like it is ballenced. running isnt imposible but it is harder then it used to be. remember this is comming from a guy that aint played since ncaa 08. passing is better then it used to be. you big recievers will make big plays. but not always either. it has a college feel and i like that. ive played road to the glory about a season and a half and i enjoyed every moment of it. yes sometimes its kind of ennoying because i want the ball every play lol but thats not relistic. ive also played about 5 games in a dynisty. recruiting is fun with actually making phone calls and disscussing different topics with people you want to recruit. you have 10 hours a week you can spend calling recuits. in this time you are trying to persuay them to stay with your team if they are already looking at your school or trying to convince them to leave the number 1 school on there list and join you. overall this game is a great experience. it is fun and has a college feel to it.", "\"I'm going to subtitle this review of NCAA Football 2011 as \"\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\"\" because there is some of all three in this year's edition of EA Sports' venerable title.  Let's start with the good because most of the game is very good.  NCAA 11 looks better than ever, from the music to the pregame charge by the teams out onto the field.  You get the sense you are sitting down in front of your TV on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy the game.  The only things missing are a roast beef sandwich and your favorite drink.  Helping bring the in-game production together is the team of Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit calling the action and Erin Andrews issuing sideline reports.  No Lee Corso this year which is good or bad depending on how you feel about him.The action on the field is smooth and crisp.  The running system has been vastly improved with the new \"\"locomotion\"\" system.  By using the right stick your player can juke and twist defenders out of their jocks or lower his soldier to get the last few tough yards.  Blockers actually block, even twenty yards downfield and you can move to take advantage of their blocks.  Receivers now hug the sideline to make great catches as they fall out of bounds.  The Defenses seem to react better and often gang-tackle opposing ball carriers rather than just stand around.  You have so much control over your team, especially with defensive adjustments that it can be daunting.  Your secondary can press or play off, double-team, adjust to one side or another, blitz or spy...same goes for your linebackers.  There's so much you can do you'll find yourself still trying to make adjustments while the offense is snapping the ball!  On offense you have the usual selection of audibles, hot routes, players going in motion, etc...Dynasty mode is back and while the basic Dynasty is pretty much the same, you can now play your Dynasty online against a group of other players who you will compete against not only on the field but off the field as you recruit high school players.  You can access your online dynasty from your PC as well.  Dynasty modes give you the ability to create newspaper stories and highlights for your team.  Cosmetic stuff but it adds a nice sense of authenticity.Speaking of recruiting, if you are a recruiting geek like me you'll have almost as much fun with that aspect as you will with game action.  Each week you'll go through your list of prospects and select if you want to call them or not and choose how much time you with to spend on the phone with them, from 10 to 60 minutes.  You can than choose which subjects you want to discuss with him such as early playing time, pro potential, conference or coach prestige, academic prestige, athletic facilities, and many more.  You can compare your program to another program he is considering and if your program is ranked higher in that subject, you will raise his interest in your program and decrease it in the rival's program.  Very Cool!  You can also schedule recruiting visits to your campus and set the activities like visiting the press box, attending a pep rally, talking to professors, all designed to hopefully raise your prospect's interest and get the all-important commitment.  Honestly the recruiting system is one of the most attractive features of this year's game.Now we get to the bad...Nessler and Herbstreit are only ordinary and repeat the same lines over and over.  It's annoying to hear Herbstreit say he expected a \"\"closer game\"\" when a powerhouse has just destroyed a team they are supposed to destroy.  As usual, penalties are problematic...leaving penalties on their default settings will result in few if any penalties during a game.  But then I raised holding penalties from 50 to 60 and I ended up with a barrage of penalties.  There seems to be no middle ground.  There are far too many injuries.  Many of these are minor bumps which give you the option of playing or resting the injured player but don't expect to get through the season without a few major injuries.Road to Glory mode is back which allows you to create a high school player and have him grow and progress into the collegiate ranks.  However it uses the exact same Erin Andrews video segments from last year's NCAA Football 10 which is very disappointing.  I realize Ms. Andrews may have been a \"\"bit busy\"\" this past year but its cheap on EA's part.  The Road to Glory is frankly boring and should be dumped in next year's edition.On to the ugly part...There are some definite glitches in the game which EA has yet to address.  First, players are getting a \"\"download failure\"\" message at the start and end of games, evidently meaning that stats are not being saved to your record online.  I placed a call to EA tech support who was aware and working on the problem but as of two weeks now, no patch has been forthcoming.  Even worse is that there are major issues with player and recruit progress over many seasons.  By the time you are into your 5th or 6th season of Dynasty mode the best recruits are only getting overall ratings in the high 60s or low 70's.  They are not progressing much over their college careers either resulting in nearly every team getting low C's or D ratings for their teams.  This is a MAJOR issue with the game and needs to be addressed by EA promptly.One other gripe is that EA offers a package of recruiting reports, recruiting advisor and progression helpers that you can buy for $30 but seriously...you've already spent $60 on the game and the additional $30 seems a bit steep.Overall this is an outstanding game.  The in-game action is the best yet with fluid movements and realistic animations.  The presentation is top-notch and the recruiting system is a blast.  But a few nagging technical issues keep this from earning a top grade.UPDATE:  EA has fixed the download failure.\"", "As far as graphics are concerned, this game could be called art. It had so many details right that I sometimes felt like I was watching a real game, and I faltered every now and again because  of that. Still, there was a lot of the time that should have been devoted to giving the total game a push that was only given to the grapics, hurting a few areas.One thing I really got tired of were running draft boards. If I want to continually have to do this, I would play something more akin the Fantasy Football and ot Vidogame variations of the game. There was a lot of thime I felt like I could have done some other stuff - like play - and be happier. I also did not like trying to get a player because, sometimes, it was as if the game was mocking me. I'm all for the realism of experience but, god, this game doesn't come with a playcheck.I wanted my fair share.Other problems - defensive aubibles to keep up with offensive changes and the need to be able to recognize teams so quickly when the offensive attacks happen. sometimes I won't havet time to switch over to my strategy before the game takes its shot at me.cruelty.And I need more plays on offense. Yhe defense has som many formation but the offense - sometimes I have to make things because I can't find  a play I want. Peronally, designing the playbook is no good for me.These are my problems and why I rated this a 4 and not a 5. The game is great - beautifully so- and I had a hard time giving it a 4 at first. Had i not played enough to tire of the pretty and look at the dynamics I might have not faulted it enough. Still, this is a beautiful game."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.20289331674575806, 0.0856471061706543, 0.003420719411224127, 0.06613237410783768, 0.14126254618167877, 0.1856815218925476, 0.005514280870556831, 0.15915603935718536, 0.15029212832450867]]}
