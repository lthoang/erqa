The creamy cleaner inside it white and the gritty bits in it feel sharp & too big for the job.It's OK for tougher skin, like elbows, however I wouldn't ever use this on my face again. I just tried a very small patch, then never used it on the rest of my face. It's simply too harsh!It feels like sharp chunks of silica, like from those packets enclosed with products to keep things dry. It is sharper than sand!This was a disappointment. Jar look pretty cool, but it should be labeled for rough & calloused skin areas (if that?) The grit is simply too large & sharp. I'd be concerned about damaging my skin using this product on any sensitive areas.I figured if you have rough hands, elbows & perhaps those with tough skin & callouses, it *might* be OK for these areas, but cuts like small barnacles... feels much like scallop shell micro-slices if you've ever taken Pacific scallops bare-handed & your hands get those micro-cut that don't bleed? Not quite that deep, but extremely close in how it feels!Not going on my skin again!", "\"I had high hopes for the Hydroxatone Microdermabrasion product. I expected it to be creamier as the product information spoke of \"\"gentle exfoliation\"\" being good for the skin. The top of the product is very dry and the first 1/4 of the product has a fondant like texture. The bottom part is where it actually becomes soft and creamy. This tells me the product is very old and gave me pause about using it. It doesn't have any scent to speak of, which is something I like in facial products.I haven't used this because it seems so old and is not dated. If I decide to take a risk and test the bottom half of the product I will come back and add the details.\"", "I use this every other day in the shower. After using it for several weeks, I do notice that the skin feels clean and refreshed after the scrubbing treatment. The cream is more abrasive than my normal apricot scrub, but not irritating at all. There's no drying side effect. That said, I expected a more medicinal treatment than just the exfoliating effect that comes from a scrub. At 8x the price of the standard drug store scrub, I'm not sure it's worth it. 4 stars for effectiveness, 2 stars for price.", "After using this product my skin was smoother.  I don't think the micro beads did much in the way of deep cleansing, as I had expected it to.  I do not like the packaging--it is difficult to get some product out without getting it under nails, etc., which is annoying and wasteful.  Given the expense of this product and the fact that the results weren't exactly stellar, I won't be purchasing this one in the future.  I think there are more effective products available at a cheaper price.", "I have used other brands of microdermabrasion products and thought I would try this one.  I am truly disappointed.This came in an almost solid form and was stiff to use.  It didn't lather up well and was harder to remove with water.  The directions also stated that it should be used every other day and then skip a week.  This tells me it is way too harsh for me.", "\"This is a creamy cleanser with no apparent added color or scent (there is a faint chemical smell of the ingredients, but no obviously added perfume), which i prefer. the \"\"grit\"\" within the product is well-distributed and concentrated (there's a lot of it in the cream), so you can definitely feel the scrubbing effect.  I tried this with my rotating Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing brush the first time (see pics), and it was a bit strong in comparison to the much less \"\"scrubby\"\" -feeling Olay dermabrasion cream, which contains a lot less, and finer grit by comparison (and lighter cream base).  I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but using your fingers to rub this product on your face makes it less likely you'll have a ruddy glowing face like i did, immediately after cleansing. - nothing too bad-- the experience was definitely revitalizing, that's for sure! My skin felt very exfoliated, clean and soft.  I'd probably only use this once per week, if i use the Olay brush.The product does not lather, and is the consistency nearly of a light putty. It feels a bit greasy and heavy when you clean with it, but after rinsing, there is no greasy after-feel (don't try to wash off all the greasy-feeling part- it soaks into your skin when dry, like a light night cream), and my skin felt a bit tightened up, but soft.  If you're looking for a serious scrub, this is an pretty good product.  I discounted one star, because i'm not sure i love the greasy/taut cream feel.\"", "ustomer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program (What's this?)I am the biggest fan of exfoliation. It changes everything.Why is it needed?When we are young, our skin renews itself often so we have that glow of new skin, no wrinkles form, and there is constant regeneration.As we age, one of the reasons we age is that our bodies stop that constant renewal process and it slows to a crawl. Dead skin, in many layers, remains on our face, dryness comes, wrinkles form. The only way to prevent the inevitable is manual regeneration. And that is done via removing those dead layers. You shouldn't do this constantly as it takes about 4 weeks for a new layer to die and constant use will dry out your skin.For years I've used micordermabrasion both professionally and in-home use to keep my youthful glow and it's worked wonderfully.I have used dermaplaning, Nutrasonic, and my 2 favorite home microdermabrasion kits have been Olay and Mary Kay.So I was excited to try this new one.Unfortunately, it simply fell flat.As the goal is to scrape off your dead skin layer, this simply couldn't do that as there are very few dermabrasion beads in comparison to, oddly, a lotion base. The lotion-style base means the beads flow effortlessly across your skin rather than being able to scrub off the top layer. And the fact that it says to put this on a damp face means there simply is no friction whatsoever.Now don't get me wrong, there is good friction and bad friction. There are products that actually hurt your skin while claiming microdermabrasion, such as ones with ground apricot pits. I used to work, long ago, in cosmetic and food ingredient sales and the scientists who develop products. I got to see what ground apricot pits do to the skin under a microscope which was horrid, even though they were very finely ground, as compared to proper ingredients that remove skin without cutting.But this was on the other end of the spectrum...it moisturized more than it utilized any type of dead skin removal.I felt it benefited me as more of a lotion, with no microdermabrasion properties.While that's not a bad thing, it's not going to smooth out or prevent any wrinkles any more than another lotion would", "This is a great exfoliant.  It takes very little of the product to cover your whole face.  It's very thick and goes a long way.  The jar is not very big.  You don't get a lot of product but it does go a long way.  I use it two to three times per week.  It easily washes off and leaves your face feeling very smooth. At first I thought it needed more abrasion but it does have a nice scrubbing sensation.  Great product.", "Never having had the desire to go to a professional for microdermabrasion, I've tried a few affordable home treatments.  I still have to say my favorite is the Mary Kay set, but this one is not too far below that standard.  This has a good, fine grit to it (no giant pieces of mystery metal ripping into your skin) and a little really goes a long way.  I like the on/off instructions for use (this is not a daily treatment) and found it helped with exfoliation without shredding my skin.  I like how my skin feels and looks afterwards.", "Not having sensitive, yet dry skin, I've not had to worry about most products effecting my skin in a negative way.  This Hydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasion was pleasantly scented and delightfully soothing.  After lightly polishing my skin it felt revitalized, soft and a bit moisturized.  I still had to follow up with a heavy night cream as my skin is very dry.  Overall, I found this product to be worth the price point.", "According to the package insert, `Revitalizing Microdermabrasion restores the appearance of radiance and vitality and is designed to increase skin turnover for a more youthful-looking glow, polishes away dull, drab, flaky skin to reveal a refreshed and rejuvenated complexion, reduces the appearance of large pores, diminishes the appearance of age spots and hyperpigmentation, smoothes and refines the appearance of wrinkles.'For the general public information, this product is a very successful substance that when applied to the face and massaged in for 1 - 3 minutes every other day It does indeed live up to the promises.  The sensation of using this product is one of removing the dead skin and opening the underlying skin to accept moisturizers and replenishing creams that in the matter of 1 -2 weeks makes the skin not only feel fresh but also allows the cleansing of deep pores and restores a youthful glow.  It is a terrific product - when used specifically as directed. Grady Harp, January13", "Hydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasion is a definite winner. I used it before applying my makeup, and there was an absolutely noticeable difference in how my makeup went on. My skin appeared to be smoother and clearer, giving me a healthy look. I've used scrubs for years, including home-made scrubs whipped up in the kitchen. However, I have to say that this product is very effective without being irritating, and I will definitely use it again.", "I'm three weeks past first using this product and here's how it worked for me.I'm 37 with decent skin. I use a ton of sunscreen year round and have since I was 18. I have freckles and get blemishes, but otherwise my skin is decent. Before trying this product I had been fighting some dry patches of skin in the T-zone and nose bridges areas and I hope this would help end that.During the week of use, I enjoyed the feel. Not to gritty or harsh as some others have been. I mistakenly once used it on my lips (which were also dry)...do NOT do this. The recovery process is awful.During the recovery week, the dry patches did not return. However, as the 'new' skin' came in, it looked a little odd to me close up. But from a regular distance I thought my skin looked more even and 'brighter'.By the end of the recovery week and into this week everything has evened out and I'm still please with how my skin looks. Those dry patches are still gone and everything really has a much more even look to it, which is saying something because of all my freckles.Overall, I like this product. Would use it once a month or every 6weeks and probably more in the non-summer seasons too.", "\"The product I received to review was definitely NOT \"\"a gentle, luxurious exfoliating cream\"\" - it was more like a dried out mess that crumbled when you dug your finger in. Even getting your fingers wet and rubbing together (to try and turn it into a paste) didn't really work that well as it stayed pretty chunky. I guess it still kinda worked, but if I had actually paid for the item, I would have sent it back because I was expecting (and wanted) a cream. So YMMV on what you actually receive. If it was as stated, I am sure I would have liked it much, much more.\"", "I loved this scrub. I have sensitive, pigmented skin, and this left my skin feeling clean & polished without being irritated. I used this in the morning and had a nice glow all day. Another plus is that just a little of this goes a long way so while this costs a bit more than the drugstore stuff, a jar of this should last a while.", "Although the product description states that this product is safe for use on sensitive skin and other reviewers found it to be so, it left my skin a bit irritated after using it the recommended way (of massaging it into your skin for 1-3 minutes in a circular motion).  I've had the same problem with other types of scrubs in the past, and have found that using a product like this just once or twice a week and with a much softer hand is generally better.That being said, this worked wonderfully well at buffing away all my dry, flaky skin.  This time of year, my face tends to peel since I use Retin-A a few times a week at night.  This took care of all the dryness, and left my skin very soft and with a nice glow.It also rinses off easily, and feels nice to use.  Just be sure to go slowly and gently if your skin is sensitive.", "\"This Hydroxatone scrub does a nice job of cleansing and leaving my skin feeling fresh and exfoliated. It has a bare, but pleasant, scent to it. To call it microdermabrasion might be a bit of a stretch, but it does work as well as any other facial scrub I have tried.The jar that the product comes in is somewhat small (for the price), and I don't particularly like sticking my finger in the jar, preferring the types of products that come in a tube to avoid this. The consistency is pretty thick so this may be why it comes in a jar rather than a tube. It doesn't take a lot of product to get a good result, though, and it rinses very easily.While my face felt soft and clean, I'm not sure that it will provide better results than your average, much less expensive, drug store brand scrub. At least so far, I am not \"\"transformed\"\", but happy enough with glowing skin.\"", "I like this Hydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasion product better than any other similar  products that I have tried.  Most feel gritty or scratchy, even when gently rubbing them on the skin and leave my face feeling dry and tight.  Not this one. Although I can feel the polishing ingredients, they do not irritate the skin, and actually feel good on my face.  This product contains antioxidants and natural ingredients to brighten the skin.  It smells pleasant and made my face feel soft and not at all tight. I've used it twice a week for about a month now, and my skin looks and feels great.", "\"I have very fine fair skin that is typical of ginger headed people.  And it seems like everything I use on my skin causes a break-out.  But since I was trying another product by Hydroxatone, I thought I'd give thisHydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasiona try.I've been usingHydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complexfor a couple of weeks and have actually noticed the fine lines around my eyes were less noticeable.  And I have to tell you, I would NOT have believed it was possible for that to happen without expensive procedures in a plastic surgeons office.  But it's true, I can barely see them and it was my husband who noticed before I did, so I know it's not just wishful thinking :)On to this product.  I like to use exfoliating scrubs on my face once a week and I think it helps, my skin certainly feels smoother and looks so much healthier when I do.  But the stuff I buy is about $6 and has crushed up apricots or something in it, much different from this!  I wasn't sure I'd notice any difference at all.Firstly, I washed my face with a gentle soap and rinsed with lukewarm water.  Then I followed the directions on the box which said to use two fingers on each hand and rub in a circular motion (after wetting the fingers).  After covering you entire face, rise carefully with cool water and moisturize.I would love to have one of those little spinning brushes to really do this well, but even with my fingers I was very pleased at how smooth my skin felt, especially the areas that tended to have whiteheads and blackheads.  All of the \"\"winter bumps\"\" (some phenomenon that afflicts me every winter) have disappeared and my skin looks radiant.  Most importantly, I had zero breakouts or any sensitivities, not even a hint of one.The product has a very pleasant clean citrus-y smell, I really like how it smells.  The texture is like a combo of if white sugar and baking soda got married and had a baby - sort of a smooth but abrasive texture.  It also moisturizes at the same time.  It blends in very well but doesn't clump up to where you have the abrasive potion on some of your face and just water on the other parts, I really appreciated that the stuff stayed where I put it but rinsed off easily.The directions say to use it every other day for a week, then rest a week, then again every other day.  I've done this and feel very happy with how my skin looks.Important points:-no reactions-good smell-really pretty skin with even tone and texture-easy to use-no burning or itching during or after use-I'm a sensitive fair skinned redhead who looks like I've done \"\"something\"\" but noone is sure exactly what ;)\"", "\"I've heard the \"\"Hydroxatone\"\" radio commercials for years now and just ignored them. I've seen the product in my Ulta flyers and just never thought about trying them. When I saw this in Vine, I decided to try it and see what it's about. There are mixed reviews about this product line (mostly about order problems) so I was unsure about how this was going to go.First of all, this is not a SCRUB. If you take 'scrub' out of the equation, and see it for what it is (manual microexfoliating) you can truly compare apples to apples. Sure, initially the price tag seems kind of high, but have you ever tried Mary Kay's set? I did, and it just about ruined my face. Tortured, red, angry skin, that's what I got! Thank goodness I was a rep and got it for 50% off, that's all I'm saying.  I am a long time and faithful Clarisonic user, but in wintertime I just need a good physical exfoliator: and the Hydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasion is a NICE product!The jar is 1.7 ounces, and at first it's hard to fathom that this 'little amount' of product and the cost of it, have anything in common. But, you use about half a teaspoon for your whole face, and only a few times a week. When compared to the Mary Kay product, in both quality and price, this is MUCH better. I also feel it is superior to the Mary Kay product in performance. This is NOT an everyday 'scrub', this is an exfoliator that WILL remove a lot of dead skin buildup in just one use. I use Retin-A and that tends to give me dry skin buildup quickly, and in winter time the Clarisonic can't really keep up with it the way I like. I enjoyed how this Hydroxatone product felt on my face. The exfoliating beads were effective but not harsh. They did not dissolve as I used it. It didn't take much pressure to get results. The biggest bonus: I have Rosacea, and it did not inflame it at all! My skin did not feel tortured after using it. A big plus, no scent other than a faint citrus/orange aroma.*Simply dampen your face, dot on the cream (cheeks, chin, forehead) and massage gently. Rinse or wipe off with warm washcloth and moisturize! Enjoy the glow!When this jar is gone (it should last me months at this rate) I will DEFINITELY have it on my rebuy list. It's so rare for me to find a manual exfoliator that doesn't shred my skin or cause it to be inflamed with irritation.UPDATE: I am able to use this as a pre-peel scrub (24 hours before your peel) with 50% glycolic acid peel or TCA peel, with NO irritation. Highly recommend! If you are considering a Glycolic or TCA peel and not sure where to get reliable ones, drop me a line. I've read the mixed reviews on those products sold here and would be afraid to try them too. :--)\"", "I've been using this product, off an on, for several weeks.  When I first got it, I decided I would try to do a side by side comparison with a much less expensive facial scrub I have.  I used this product on one side of my face, and the other (a Nivea scrub) on the other.  I rubbed both products around on my face according to the instructions for this product.  After a few days, it did seem to me that the side of my face where this product was being used was a bit smoother.  Unfortunately, after a few more days, an area of my forehead where this product was being used seemed to be developing a significant seborrheic keratosis that this product seemed to be making worse.  (I had previously encountered a similar reaction to a prescription cream my dermatologist gave me.)  After discontinuing use of this product, that skin reaction subsided.  A couple of weeks later, I decided I would try to use this product again.  Within a few days, I was developing another obvious seborrheic keratosis.  Discontinuing the product again, the skin reaction subsided within a couple of days.Based on my limited experience, I'd say that someone with my background (51 year old with many childhood sunburns and thus, today, regular visits to a dermatologist to screen for skin cancer and to remove more benign skin growths) is not a good candidate for this product.  I think the chemicals in it that help abrade the dead skin cells end up revealing ugly but benign skin growths that would otherwise be somewhat masked by the outer skin layer.  If you're someone with skin that's in better condition to begin with, perhaps this would be a good exfoliating product for you.", "I don't have sensitive skin so I like exfoliators and microdermabrasion products that give me a good scrub.  I haven't found many that leave my face with a nicely polished feeling and slightly pink cheeks.  My favorite so far had beenderma e Microdermabrasion Scrub, 2 oz (56 g).  The beads in that scrub really let you know you're exfoliating.  This Hydroxatone product comes in at a close second for me.  It's a little gentler than the derma e scrub but if you don't wet your face before using it, it is an effective exfoliator and skin polisher. And if you want a gentler scrub, wet the face first.  So I like this.  Whether I choose to use this or my old faithful derma e product in future will come down to price.", "\"No scrub has ever left my face as smooth, soft, or bright as I would like but I also acknowledge the fact that my expectations may be way too high and unreasonable.  This microdermabrasion is as good as any other I've tried and maybe better.The jar that the product comes in is a very pretty bright blue but I really don't like sticking my finger (albeit clean) in  the jar.  Products in jars are not good for my \"\"ocd.\"\" There is no telltale fragrance which is a plus.  The consistency is thicker than other scrubs I've used which is probably why it comes in a jar rather than a tube.  I wet my fingers a bit to create a better consistency for massaging over my face.  It rinses really easily, actually, easier than others i've used.  My face felt very soft and it looked really glowing and bright after I used it.  It's a bit pricey and perhaps one can get equal results with a less expensive brand.\"", "This lightly scented, textured cleansing cream seems to be quite effective in revitalizing skin, and polishing the dead skin cells away. I have sensitive skin, and this cream left my skin feeling and looking clean, smoothed, polished, and glowing, without inflammation or tenderness. It also does not dry out my skin, which I sometimes experience with other products.", "I really liked this microdermabrasion cream. You don't need to use a lot with each application, so the jar should last a while.  When using it on my face, I could really feel the exfoliating effects.  After using it, my skin was extremely smooth.  It didn't leave my skin dry or red.  I've tried other exfoliating creams before but I found this one to work the best.", "\"I have to say, I am really impressed with this microdermabrasion cream.  Per the instructions I have been using every other day for a week, and then I will take a week off.  I have done this for a month and I can really tell a difference in the softness and tone of my skin.  I use a small dab on the index finger of each hand each time...and that is enough for my whole face and it has enough \"\"grit\"\" to it that you don't need to use anything else with it.  I follow this up with the Hydroxatone Deep Nighttime Moisturizer.  This is a fabulous combination, I highly recommend it.  The products are a little pricey but it doesn't take much of either one so if they last 6 to 9 months, I think it is worth it.\"", "\"I've tried a couple other \"\"microderm\"\" products and this one doesn't stack up to those.

It doesn't take a a lot of scrub to polish your face, which is good since this isn't a huge jar  (1.7 ounces, unlike what the description says at 1.8 ounces). The jar does flare out at the top, but this is an illusion. The container that holds the cream is actually tube shaped on the inside with no actual product in the flared part.
