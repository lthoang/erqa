One of them is still going strong years later. Sadly, the model I'm reviewing here hasn't lived up to the high quality of the past. The cord has broken just below the &#34;V&#34; part when the two wires come together. I treat my electronics gently too -- it's not like I was jogging with these and tugging on the cord all the time -- so I don't understand how it happened. I've owned these less than 3 months, so I'm disappointed. I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 only because they were pretty cheap.", "I bought the Ultimate Ears MetroFi 220vi Noise Isolating Earphones w/ Microphone in June of 2010.  I own the Palm Pixie phone and they did a great job for answering calls, listening to music, toggling between the two, forwarding tracks, pausing music.  The volume on my phone isn't great which limited the potential for both pair of Ultimate Ear buds.  In January, 2011 the 220vi's had an issue with the wire near the jack.  Logitech replaced the earphones no problem and sent me 500vi's.  They are improved.  The wire is flat, very cool, no tangling.  I dont have an iPhone but the controls for all the features are awesome, more streamlined and easier to control.  The ear-buds are smaller but don't seem to effect the sound. They come with more tips to fit your ear exactly.  I suggest getting these:http://www.amazon.com/Comply-Tx-400-Integrated-Wax-Guard-3-Pair/dp/B002OOWBWA/ref=pd_cp_e_1.  Really cancel out ambient noise and fit any ear well.  I tried the Bose ones and honestly its a toss up for me, I tried them out at an outlet and the sound seemed a little better with the bose's. But I got the 500vi's as a free replacement and dont have 130 buck to try them both out.", "These Ultimate Ears headsets by Logitech are obviously excellent sonically, and have some nice features. The flat-type cord stays untangled more easily, and the 4' foot length is great when you're holding your phone in your bag. This also works for Android tablets. And of course the headset has a remote so you can keep your phone in your bag or pocket and answer, adjust volume, etc. But there are several significant negatives. I don't use a carrying case, and most standard earbuds work fine for me, so the case and 5 sets of buds seem like overkill. But the biggest negative is the price. These are simply way overpriced, unless you have money to burn. I got these as a Vine reviewer, but I would never spend $79+ on headphones, I would rather save the money, and you can get a great set of earphones with all the same features for $20. If I lost these, or they broke or malfunctioned, because my phones take plenty of abuse in my pockets walking around and exercising, how would I replace them? They're too expensive. I would be interested how much a set of equivalent-quality phones would cost without the extra accessories, in simpler packaging. I would consider buying headsets in the ~$20 range, and if you are the 2% these might be great for you, but this is not a practical product for me.", "\"I own about 10 different pairs of noise canceling earphones from brands like Shure, Maximo iMetal, Philips, Zune Premium V2, Altec Lansing in the $30-$100 range. These UE headphones perform very nicely for their price range of about $50. The sound fidelity is great in the highs and lows, I like them perhaps a shade more than myPhilips SHE9800 In-Ear Headphones with Advanced Acousticsalthough I think theShure SE115-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Dynamic Microspeaker II (Black)are a shade better in the highs reproduction, but also more expensive.The flat no tangle cord is nice, and the length is adequate. The cord feels very sturdy unlike the cord which comes with their super expensive but super good Triple Fi 10 headphones. I also like that these earphones come with so many ear cushions plus comply foam tips that conform to your ears. If needed more replacements are available on Amazon.There is a 500 vi version with a mic for those who want to use it with a phone. The other models in their range are UE 200 which are cheaper with very nice fidelity although not as good as these. There is also a UE 700 version with a \"\"dual\"\" armature which creates very nice sound with separation.\"", "\"An admitted headphone junkie, I was psyched to see a new pair of iPhone-compatible headphones come to market.  I've always liked the sound of Ultimate Ears, but have had some issues with the build-quality of their cheaper models.  I've been using the Klipsch models s4i and s5i recently and have been very pleased (especially with the s5i), but was burned by their service department and wanted to try something else - if only for spite.These arrived in a sleek little injected foam filled box that said \"\"quality\"\" and made it exciting to try them out.  Before even putting them in I noticed a few things: they come packed with a pair of Comply Foam earpieces (actually even better than the ones you get direct from Comply as they're round), which I MUCH prefer to any silicone tips.  The cabling is flat, which reduces tangling.  The plug is L-shaped and very low-profile, and the earbuds themselves are very small and solid.The best thing about them though, was what I heard when I put them on... as I mentioned, I use some pretty decent headphones all the time.  Certainly, if price is your starting point, all my headphones should be comparable or better than these.  Well, the moment I turned on the tunes I was almost blown away.  The bass is outstanding and the sound incredibly rich and clear. I do prefer a little extra bass and these were standouts.  Of course you can pay more for clearer, better sound, but I want a pair of headphones with a remote for the iPhone, and frankly, my headphones take such a beating day-to-day, considering that I'm not using these for anything like studio work, anything much beyond $100 starts seeming like diminishing returns and possibly a complete waste.There are only a few issues I have with these, and they are all very minor.  I don't necessarily love the cabling.  It's nice that it doesn't tangle and seems very durable, but the cost is that they're a little stiff and transmit more noise than more supple cables.  Wearing the cables over your ears rather than hanging straight down helps a lot, as does using the clip.  Speaking of the clip, it works about as well (or poorly) as any clip that comes with headphones.  It constantly detaches from the cable, there seems to be no perfect placement, and I think I've lost it already.The other issue I have is with the remote.  It's a nice little remote hanging off the right earpiece's cable that barely adds any weight to that side.  The mic works great, and I love being able to FF, REW, pause, and answer calls with  it.  However, the buttons, while they work, are strangely designed and kind of awkward to differentiate with your fingers (which you have to do because of the location - you can't see them without taking the earpiece out).  The buttons are very flush and indented, it would be better to have a raised dimple rather than a recessed one.  I got used to it.  I would prefer to have the remote lower on the cable and the mic where it is.Lastly, there's no cable-pincher at the Y-junction.  In other words, there should be a little piece of plastic that slides up toward your chin to clamp the left and right cables together. It keeps the cable from moving around and makes the whole thing sturdier, which minimizes cable noise.  I would MUCH prefer that to a clip, but why not have both?PROS:Rich bass, clear sound (much better than average)Tangle-free, quality cablingL-shaped plugiPhone mic and remote (also works with other devices to varying degrees)included foam eartipssmall and sleek earbudsCONS:some cable noiseodd buttonsno Y-junction sliderOverall, these are fantastic headphones for the price, especially for iPhone users.\"", "Simply put these earphones live up to their hype!They are comfortable.Wire more substantial and tangle free.Blocks out residiual noise.SOUND QUALITY IS CRISPER!, CLEARER!, AND DEEPER!", "Wow, these earphones are a lot nicer than any other ones I've tried!First of all, there are 5 different sizes of silicone ear pieces, so you can get the best fit for your ears.  There is also a pair of foam ear pieces if you like that better than the silicone.And they really do cancel out background noise better than other headsets I've used, especially once I used the best size for my ear.It's really handy to have a switch on the cord that enables me to answer the phone, pause my music, or turn the volume up and down.  Of course, there is also a carrying case and a clip for your clothes, which is also nice.These are very convenient, and I'm glad to have them.", "I bought these for $29 and I really like them. They sound great and are well made. I can lay my head down with them in and it doesn't bother me. They are small but sound great. I would recommend them for the price. I have never paid much for headphones or earbuds.", "I am a fairly critical listener and dislike most in-ear headphones, a.k.a. earphones, with very few exceptions (e.g. Etymotic ER-4 series).  But my wife needed some better earphones and these fit the budget and requirements quite nicely.These earphones sound and look very good for most purposes, just not &#34;ultimate&#34; fidelity in spite of the name. Upgrade to the phones that came with cell phone, and/or cheap skull candy models.A success in terms of my purpose for purchasing. Nice as a gift for adults who appreciate understated packaging.", "These actually sound a bit better than the Apple In-Ears, much clearer basses.  But, the volume is lower, so much so that I have everything turned up to max almost all of the time.I've tried both the silicone buds and the foam ones, I like the feel of the silicone ones better but the sound blocking of the foam ones better.  Hard to tell if either will hold up in the short time I've owned these, and like Apple, it doesn't look like replacements are available, at least I don't see them listed on Amazon.I like that they're black, which is the main reason I requested them.  Wearing white earphones around where I live is an open invitation to muggers to grab your iAnything, and a microphone even makes it worse.  The microphone on this is pretty discrete.  Unlike the product page says, all of the functions of the phone seem to work with my iPhone 4s.Which leads me to my constant nag, at least when I'm wearing a jacket, the control is not up near your right ear as it is on other headphones, it is down after the 2 wires join and is covered up with a jacket or coat.  I keep having to unzip my coat every time I want to control my phone.  Doesn't anybody but Apple make products that just work without getting in my way?If I had to replace my earphones, for about the same price,  I'd buy the Apples if it was summer time and these if it were winter.", "I just got these in the mail yesterday, as my original ipod earbuds were failing miserably.  The sound, for the money, of these earphones is great!!  I'm very pleased with the bass response from these little guys.  I've only been using the foam forming, noise reducing, inserts.  I can see where they could become worn and easily come off the earbuds if you change them often.  I don't like the feel of the plastic buds, and they wouldn't stay in my ears for more than a few minutes.  If this set came with 2/3 more sets of the foamies, they couldn't go wrong.More to follow with after some use at the gym", "These Logitech Ultimate Ears earbiuds come nicely packaged and with a variety of tips. The default ones fit my ears fine, providing a tight but soft and comfortable seal.  Ambient room noise fades pretty much entirely.I tried these earbuds on an HTC Evo View Android tablet and a 4g iPod Touch, and compared them to stock Apple earbuds.  The Ultimate Ears have a nice rich sound that emphasizes midrange bass but covers highs and lows very well.  Bass guitar enthusiasts should love these.  By comparison the Apple earbuds have a somewhat higher volume on both my devices for some reason but they emphasize high frequencies much more.  The Apples really sound tinny compared to the Ultimate Ears.I did not have an Android phone at hand but on my Android tablet a single click of the control button paused and unpaused my Meredian music player app just fine.  Double clicking of some sort seems to either go back to the beginning of the song or to the next track.  Haven't totally figured it out yet.  On Android phones the button answers or hangs up calls.  On an iPod Touch single click pauses and double click goes to the next song.They also have a clip to attach the cord to your shirt and keep the controls close at hand, and a nice compact carrying case.For full rich sound that blocks background noise these Ultimate Ears earbuds do an excellent job.", "Overall, these seem to be very good earbuds.  Here are the things I liked and didn't like.Likes- I love the idea of a case.  My earbuds are either thrown in my purse, my gym bag, or in a drawer.  They get banged up, the rubber covers get lost, they are always tangled, etc.  Having a nice little case to put them in before they go into my purse/gym bag/drawer is fantastic!- They seem to cancel out noise pretty well and have an overall good sound.- The six sizes of covers should easily fit anyone's ear, even if you have very small/large ear canals or odd shaped ones.  Not to mention, it is nice to have backups if you forget your case and lose them in your purse/gym bag/drawer!  :)- I don't use the microphone, but that is a benefit none of my other earbuds have.  If you are a microphone user, having this option along with a high quality set of earbuds would be very nice.Dislikes- Price - Up until now, I have been using Skull Candy Inkd earbuds.  The sound quality is the same, the noise canceling is pretty much the same, and the rubber covers are identical (granted, there are only 3 vs the 6 here).  I can buy these for under $10 if I watch for a sale.  The Logitech ones are $80.  That is a BIG difference.  Obviously, if you used the microphone, the Skull Candy isn't going to work for you though.So, my final thoughts are that they are very good earbuds and if you need a microphone or have difficulties finding earbuds that are comfortable in your ears, definitely give the Logitech ones a shot.  If you are like me and don't use the microphone and don't have fit issues, there are much cheaper alternatives that are just as good.UPDATE:I have been using these for about six months in the gym and had to come back and update my review.  I hate them.  They don't do a good job of canceling noise at all.  I can have my music turned up and can still hear everyone talking around me, the noise from equiptment being used, etc.  Also, the ear buds don't stay in place and want to fall out of my ears.  I have the same size rubber things on them as I do on my other ear buds and those stay in perfectly.  With these, I'm constantly shoving them tighter in my ears and then when I take them out, sometimes the rubber part comes off and I have to dig it out of my ear canal which is somewhat scary.  The case I loved to protect them has also been a disappointment.  The back hinge broke after maybe 50 openings making it useless.  The only good thing I can say about them is that they don't tangle much.", "I love the good range of sound that is reproduced from these earphones.So good that I have a hard time differentiating them from  my balanced armature ones", "I have been using Ultimate ear headphones for about 10 years now, and they are among my favorites.However, I have noticed a steep drop in price (perhaps since taken over by Logitech?), but I also feel I have noticed a decline in quality...sadly. Not so much the quality of the sound, but the quality of the bud itself.I have. Ever had an UE fall apart on me, and my last 3 actually had the wires come off the earbuds, and one headset actually came apart. All ended up in the garbage, something that has never happened to any of my older sets.None the less, I am rating these 5 star, as I am an eternal optimist. Also, the price point was so low, they are almost disposable &#60;g&#62;. But also because the sound and feel of the UE 500vi is really good. So good, I am tempted to buy a backup pair for when these ultimately break.The first thing I did was change the ear buds to Complys. I think they sound so much better then any if the plastic ear pieces. I also took a couple days to break them in (played all kinds of music through them before wearing). I know some people think this is not really necessary, but as it doesn't hurt anything, and psychology is a big part of any experience, so I do it anyway.Verdict: terrific sound, great fit and an awesome set of of earphones that work great on my IPhone 5s", "One might think that sound is the most critical aspect of purchasing earphones, but fit is more important. Without a proper fit, the sound won't be good no matter how good the reproductive abilities of the earphone. In the fit department, the Logitech earphones are excellent for this price point. Included within the kit are five different sizes of silicon ear buds that slip on and off the earphones themselves. These are meant to be lodged into your ear canal but not be so slippery as to dislodge while you walk, jog, or sit absolutely still. I found that the smallest of the tips, the XXS size, fit perfectly. With these in place, however, reproduction of sound was only fair. The bass was lacking. Given the other reviews, I suspected this might be due to the silicon tips. I therefore switched to the also-included foam tips.Anyone who has used EAR earplugs or similar (the kind you squish, then put into your ear canal where it expands) will recognize the foam tips Logitech includes. This is the exact same type of material, so you squish the foam tips, place the earplugs into your ears where the tips expand again. These had a perfect fit, were comfortable, AND allowed for all the bass to come through. In comparison to the Apple iPhone earphones, the fit is ten times better. Sound is crisper and cleaner, though a bit softer in volume for a given output setting on the iPhone. The frequency response for the Apple earphones, frankly, isn't bad by comparison, but given that they don't fit in one's ears, you can never tell unless you keep your hands over your ears as well. These foam tips also do a superb job of blocking exterior noise. Not good for driving, but great if you're in a commercial airliner, subway, or other similar location. You can hear music without harming your ears while simultaneously not hearing as much of the external noise.The Logitech earphones include a small plastic case to prevent tangling. These earphones can also be used to talk on the phone and to adjust volume, answer/hang up, skip songs, and so forth. The switch is handy and the cord long enough to allow you to keep the phone in your pants pocket while still having full control of the phone. The cord is a bit long but comes with a clip that allows you to run the wire along your shirt or attached to your waistband. I've made several phone calls using the Logitech cord; those at the other end told me that my voice was clear and unhindered by background noise. Similarly, they sounded clear and crisp. The ability of the earphones to block out external noise is a real plus over the standard bluetooth one-ear set.I tested the functions with an iPhone 4 and found that all controls worked as described in the instructions.I'd like to see the product include a few more sets of the foam plugs in various sizes since they will probably wear out eventually as EARplugs do. The product could have better sound - there are certainly more expensive earphones that do - but at this price point, the sound quality present here is quite competitive.", "\"These earphones are comfortable and to be certain of that, several sizes of earbuds are included along with some foam tips.  One of the few negatives with these phones is the case that holds the ear cushions and adapters.  It is small and very slick, so that it was difficult for me to open.  The surface is so smooth your fingers slide off as you try to press the open button.The music has good balance, and is crisp and pleasant.  However, I  could not get \"\"excessive\"\" volume.  For me, as an adult, it was fine, but for a teen????  I think they would object strenuously to the inability to \"\"turn up the noise\"\".  The garment clip is a nice touch and the ease of switching between your audio source and a phone call is fantastic...absolutely the best feature.  The remote is part of the cable, easily located, and in an easy to use location.  It controls the sound source (phone vs music) as well as volume.I will experiment with the volume further.  It may be the audio source that was lacking, but I will watch for other reviews to see if that is a problem.\"", "These are the closest to an in-ear studio monitor that I've heard.  They reproduce sounds with surprising clarity.  With UE being a pioneer in dual armature and custom fitted IEMs this was no surprise, but these days this is getting harder and harder to find in a cheap headphone.  The gaudy style of Beats has recreated the industry standard into one where treble and mids come second to molar-loosening bass.  I saw some meathead in the gym the other day in red and purple spandex with matching red Beats headphones.  He thought he looked cool.  However the UE 500's sit unobtrusively in the ear canal and do not draw attention to the wearer.  The plastic housings felt cheap but save on weight, which keeps them in place better than metal or wood, especially when running.  The comply tips are surprisingly great, and have the best fit and sound isolation of any other material including gel and generic memory foam tips.", "I am a bit of a headphone fanatic, but I am not a rich headphone fanatic, so I have not been able to try the more expensive gear that is available in this category. I am also a listener of primarily classical music. So sound precision is very important to me. I gotta say that I love these headphones. The sound panorama is fantastic. I really feel like I'm at an actual concert. I noticed that other reviewers complained about the weak bass response of the headphones. That has not been the case for me. To the contrary, the bass response has been quite impressive, but not over-bearing. The whole soundstage is filled with pleasing energy.I also have the kind of ears that do not work with nearly all in ear phones. About 10% of people lack the ear structure that allows for the easy use of most such headphones, so fit is a crucial aspect for me. Again, these phones are really great. They come with many sizes of ear buds, but more importantly, they offer buds that can mold to the actual shape of your ears. These work great for me.Finally, they come with a small switch on the wire that allows me to transfer to incoming phone calls instantly, as well as to adjust volume levels without needed to take out my iPhone or iPod.Very strongly recommended.", "I opened up my Ultimate Ear 500 (UE 500) and gave them a try as soon as they showed up on the door. The first thing I had to do was swap out the ear cushions. Not a problem with 5 other pairs included to choose from. I settled on the black Comply type as they were the most comfortable.The carrying case is a bit iffy. It popped open on my carpet after a roughly 3 ft drop.Once they fit well, the first thing I noticed when using the UE 500 was the noise cancellation. It was noticeably better than my cheap headsets even without music, which is good but unsurprising.The tangle free cord is a fantastic addition, since every corded headset I've ever had has been a tangled mess. The length of this cord is a decent length for me, never being in that awkward too long or too short range, but thats not really an issue with most ear phones.All that is fine and well but the real reason for earphones is audio. The UE 500's provided fantastic sound quality. I found these little guys to do better than a wireless headset that was over twice as expensive.Over all, I'd recommend these as over anything else I've wasted my money on, with the only improvement being a microphone which is available from the 500vi model", "\"I am pretty impressed with these headphones. The sound is rich and they are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I have been running on my treadmill while wearing these headphones. I can notice when wearing them that the sound of the treadmill is cut down significantly. I am not 100% convinced that it is not due soley to the silicon buds and not some \"\"active\"\" electronic circuitry. Whatever it is, you can notice louder outside sounds cut down significantly.Pros:>> Nice cord length>> Pretty untangle-able cord (which is nice I tend to get them all wrapped up).>> Good sound response>> Adequate noise cancellation(did not try on a plane).Cons:&lt;&lt; Feels a bit fragile at times&lt;&lt; Bass response could be sharperOverall this is a very nice headset to replace the horrific ones from Apple.Thank you for reading my review.\"", "i generally listen to podcasts (and thus have no high demand for really good earbuds), but having loaded several hundred rock & metal albums onto my new Galaxy Note 3 recently, I wanted a more audiophilic experience, and when these went on sale for $25 i scooped up a pair. Love 'em.For serious listening at home I still rely on my Grados and an amp, but when i'm out and about and require some tunes these really fit the bill. :)", "These are very good earbuds, especially given the price. They give out great sound quality and well noise isolation. The noise isolation works perfect for me. However, it is only recommended if you own any i-product series such as ipod/iphone as the control buttons only work with Apple's i-product. Another minor issue is the carry case. It's hard to use and they barely fit in.The flat cord design is really cool as it is essentially impossible to tangle. The 4-foot cord is a bit long for me.The Jack is bent at 90 degree, which reduces the risk of the cord pulling out of the jack.All in all, this is a good product. It's comfortable to wear with decent noise reduction capability and nice sound quality. For this price, I highly recommend it if you are using i-product.", "These are by far the most expensive earphones I've tried, and they sure make a difference.  Either listening to music on my iPhone, or playing computer games, the audio quality is fantastic.  The sound is clear, the background (in the game) sounds come across as they should, and any ambient noise is greatly muffled, and unnoticeable while the iPhone or the computer is playing sound.  The six sets of differently-sized ear cushions are a very nice touch, and makes the set very comfortable on the ears.  I also like the flat audio cable; perhaps functionally they are no different than any other audio cables, but they look nice.  The integrated microphone works well.The set also comes with a plastic storage/carrying case with soft rubber inside.  All in all, a very nice set.", "Several months ago I invested in an Apple Iphone 4 because I was tired of lugging around a separate MP3 player for my music, a digital camera for taking photographs and a cell phone for calling friends and relatives while traveling.  I wanted a portable device that would be a combination of everything I needed.  I am quite happy with my Iphone 4, which has a beautiful, sleek design; it is solid black with a burgundy bumper case.  Unfortunately, the headset that came with it is white and clashes horribly with my Iphone 4.  I was very grateful for the Logitech Ultimate Ears 500vi Noise-Isolating Headset because its design is not only more complementary but it also functions remarkably better with my Iphone 4.What I love most about the Logitech headset is that it doesn't get tangled up into a big knot like ALL the other headsets I've owned.  The cord on the Logitech headset is flat.  I don't waste five to ten minutes trying to untangle it.  It's miraculous.  As I've stated earlier, it complements my black Iphone 4, making it appear more attractive and tasteful.  Also, it blocks out more noise than any other headset I've owned.  Its noise cancelling capability is remarkable.  The first time I put the ear buds into my ears I noticed a big difference.  I became nearly deaf.  I could barely hear any outside noises.  When I was wearing them inside my apartment, I couldn't hear my oven timer going off.  Fortunately, I was merely preheating the oven and not actually baking anything.  I can see why many might consider these headsets safety hazards when operating a vehicle.The Logitech headset came neatly packaged in a cardboard box that can be reused for storage.  See the photographs that I have posted on this website.  I hate opening plastic, clamshell packages that are worthless after they've been torn into and ripped apart.  At least I have a box that can be used for storing the documentation, extra ear bud cushions and protective hard case when they are not being used.  The user guide is very easy to read and understand.  I didn't need a magnifying glass like I did for so many other manuals that came with electronic devices.  The XS size soft ear cushions are the most comfortable fit for my ears.  I use the protective hard case for storing the white headset that came packaged with my Apple Iphone 4.I use my Apple Iphone 4 more for listening to music than I do for anything else.  The on-cord controls allow me to easily increase and decrease the volume of a particular song.  All of my songs are downloaded from Amazon.  Some are inexplicably louder than others.  Therefore, the volume adjuster is a necessity.  Pausing a song is also easy; this is essential for when I want to make a phone call.  If I am walking outdoors while listening to music and someone I know approaches me, I have to remove the ear buds in order to speak with them because the noise cancelling capability is very powerful.Using the on-cord controls to repeat a song, advance to the next song, and reverse to the previous one was more difficult initially.  Even today, it is still sporadic.  However, usage became easier as time progressed.  One must exercise patience.  It is best to attempt to repeat a song when it has barely finished instead of waiting until the next track is already playing.  The on-cord controls for the Logitech headset function about the same as the on-cord controls for the headset that came packaged with my Iphone 4.  However, as an extra bonus, the Logitech headset has an adjustable clip for attaching the cord to one's clothing and preventing the cord from dangling excessively.  The clip adds stability.Overall, I am pleased with my Logitech Ultimate Ears 500vi Noise-Isolating Headset.  This is the only one I use with my Iphone 4 because I want the best for it.  Consequently, I am very careful about protecting the headset from damage and loss.  Again, I'll say that what I like most about it is the cord's resistance to becoming tangled in a knot.  Untying a knotted cord can be frustrating, time consuming and dangerous, especially if one is driving down a busy interstate at sixty miles per hour.  I highly recommend it to anyone who seriously uses their Apple Iphone 4 for playing music and watching videos.Update on 11/4/11:  After using this product for nearly six months, I've discovered to my frustration that the silicone ear cushions come off too easily.  The small ones get inside my ears while the larger ones fall off onto my clothing and get lost inside my car or on the ground.  They get warped with continual usage; one of the black foam comfy tips actually ripped apart.  It is best, in my opinion, to buy ear buds that are one size fits all; therefore, one doesn't have to worry about losing the ear cushions.  Currently, I am using the headset that was provided with my Apple iPhone 4.Joseph B. Hoyos", "Let me state up front, I'm a huge Logitech fan. When buying products for my laptop or computer, I seek out this brand. Most of the time, their prices are competitive, but what has sold me is the quality. Logitech products last. So when I saw the Ultimate Ears 500 offered, this was a no-brainer.What grabbed me from the beginning was the sturdy, flat cable design. How smart to create such a shape that is less likely to not become tangled. There's a little bit of artwork, which might appeal to some. For me, I'm more into functionality--which brings me to the base.With my last purchase of earbuds, the only real complaint was the size of the base. It was too bulky. During exercise, I use my MP3. Whenever I wipe my face, I'll bump the base and the earbud will pop out. Logitech's Ultimate Ears has a sleek design that fits snug in the ear. It's not bulky and can withstand me wiping my face without disruption. Also, with this versatile design, you can wear them in two directions - straight down or securely over your ears while exercising. Either way is comfortable and stays secure throughout my workout.The UE 500 also comes with five pairs of soft (yet sturdy) silicone ear cushions with a bonus pair of noise-isolating foam cushion. The foam pair blocks out most outside noise. What surprised me is the silicone cushions blocked out more noise than my current pair--a considerable amount, in fact, but buyers should be warned about one thing. The foam cushions caused pressure on my eardrum, to the point I can't wear them. It could be my ears are sensitive, but I did want to add this info.Another accessory is the carrying case. Normally, I don't care for such a thing as my earbuds stay attached to my MP3, iPhone, or iTouch. Each device has its own set, but it's a great storage for the extra cushions.Now about compatibility. On my Sansa MP3, it works like a standard set of earbuds. For the iPhone 4 and the iTouch 4, the controls (volume/pause/mic) work perfectly. I also tried this product on a LG Rumor Touch with positive results. I love how the controls are close to the ear verses closer to the chest area. No more fumbling around trying to locate the dang thing.Bottom line is Logitech's Ultimate Ears 500 is a bit on the pricey side, but lives up to hype with high-quality speakers that deliver a full-body sound. The outside noise reduction is amazingly noticeable, but the foam can cause pressure to the eardrum. Excluding foam and sticking with the silicone, there's still a noticeable difference, more so than the others I've tried.", "Audio-wise, very clean and clear....very accurate frequency response...and durable.  Very convenient to have a microphone to answer my iPhone while listening to Pink Floyd.  There are very few headsets that are intra-aural that sound as good...and all are far more expensive.", "Since my Beats by Dr. Dre Tours just broke, wanted to compare the UE500's design compared to the Tours.pros:-protrudes from ear canal less so you can put you head down on the side if sleeping on airplane-smaller and less obtrusive-decent case, although barely large enough to fit the headphones-ear cushions stay on bettercons:-selection of ear cushions not as varied compared to Tours (although good selection of sizes)-antenna for FM radio doesn't work as well-flat cable seems a bit weak as well as strain reliefs-headphone jack is taller and protrudes more from the phone/mp3 playeroverall the design is better for the Tours although it's almost double the costOne other thing - the 500vi with the microphone does NOT work with a Samsung Focus S Windows Phone running Mango. Another reviewed noted that it does, but that is incorrect.", "\"Really liked this headset as it provides following:- An excellent sound quality over complete spectrum from highs to midtones to lows- Really super bass and crystal clear sound...you can really \"\"FEEL\"\" the music- Very good noise isolation, you can really feel the difference if you compare these headphones with others from similar price range- Somehow the sound never gets too loud, which is really good for your ears. You will inadvertently not get into habit of listening to too loud music and hence save potential damage to your ear drums- A small plastic carry box has solved the problem which resulted in damaging 3 of Apple headsets- Wire of these headsets is very thick and sturdy and hence less likely to get damaged in handling- 5 different sized earbuds will ensure that it fits almost everyone.I think one has to be careful since it seem that the suction creates some sort of vacuum inside your ears. Or maybe, I am over thinking here since they fit so well in my ears, unlike those Apple headsets.These are definitely expensive headsets, but worth the money, if you are a music lover and on the move.\"", "I got these because I have small ear canals and thought the several sizes of buds would mean there'd be one to fit me. But even the smallest ones make it feel like I have elephants in my ears, so my husband snatched them from me and has been using them since. He hides them from the kids. He loves them -- they block out all external noise and the flat cord means no tangles. He has not complained about a lack of bass response because he uses them mostly for listening to audiobooks or other speech.", "\"=====================The Pros=====================+ [6 Sizes of Ear Plugs]5 sizes of the plastic earbuds and 1 set of foam Comply buds.+ [Some Android Functionality]Though only officially stated to work with the iPhone/iPad/iPod, the center button of the controller does work on some Android phones. I have a Nexus One and can confirm all the functionality listed for iPhone also works with the N1 (Play/Pause, Answer/Hang-up, Skip)+ [Basic Protective Case]It's certainly nothing impressive, but the basic protective case is indeed a hard shell that will protect your earbuds...Though you've got to curl them up fairly snugly to fit into the case. Personally, I use Camel SNUS chewing tobacco tins. They only cost a few bucks, have a nice oval shape and solid protection.+ [Flat Cable]As advertised, the wires are flat (and look like black chinese noodles) and tangling is minimal.+ [Controls on Right-Side Earbud Wire]The mic is in the controller so, for one, that puts the mic closer to your mouth and a fringe benefit is that it's easy to quickly know which earbud is meant for the right ear (since the controller is on the right wire)+ [Great Sound]The bass could be stronger and the vocals can sometimes seem a bit \"\"tinny\"\", but overall these drivers produce rich, clear, detailed sound. I would attribute the sometimes tinny vocals with music to perhaps Logitech tuning these drivers to be more vocals oriented (these are also used for calls afterall).=====================The Cons=====================Other than the minor quips already stated with the pros, there's really nothing else I can offer in terms of cons.=====================Conclusion=====================As a comparison I also have the V-Moda Vibe Earbuds, as well as the Logitech Ultimate Ears TripleFi10. The TripleFi10 being the big-big-big Brother of these 500vi buds, it's not fair to compare the two, but I must admit the 500vi did quite well in comparison! As already stated in the pros section, the 500vi could be better in a couple of spots but overall gives a very respectable performance. The V-Moda was my everyday buds as I like their bass output (and the rather large and clunky TripleFi10s are more a once in a while use), but where the V-Moda excels in bass, they're rather weak in clarity and depth.All that said, these 500vi buds are my new everyday buds, with the bonus of also being a headset for my Nexus One and I have no problem recommending them\"", "I've auditioned quite a few in-ear headsets over the years with one purpose in mind:  to have a great sounding headset that I can workout with that is comfortable, lightweight and will also control my iPhone.  While exercising, if I want to change song tracks, adjust the volume, or answer a phone call, the last thing I want disrupting the workout is taking my iPhone out of my pocket.  The Ultimate Ears 500vi fulfills all of these requirements wonderfully.The sound quality of the 500vi is great.  The sound is smooth and evenly balanced throughout the highs, mids, and lows; there is no exaggeration of any one frequency.  The imaging is also really good for a lightweight single driver headset.  While the soundstage is not as good as my set of Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 (which has dual drivers), the 500vi does a good job at nearly a third of the price.  The 500vi is also good at noise-cancellation.  I've used them at some noisy locations, such as a loud Starbucks and the gym, and they really suppress the outside noise.Another feature that I found very useful is the cord design.  The flat cord helps to keep it from tangling which is common with many of the other in-ear headsets that I've tried.  The angled connector is also a nice feature since the phone now sits more comfortably in my pocket.  The cord is very light which helps keep the buds seated in my ears since there is less weight pulling them down.  There is also a shirt clip that helps keep the cord in place.Some reviews mentioned the on-cord controls being too small and flimsy; for me, the size of the controls is not a problem. The buttons seem well spaced out so I've never inadvertently pressed the wrong button because they were too close together.  The controller is light but it does feel sturdy.  I think if it were heavier, it may potentially cause the buds to dislodge from my ears.Some other features that I really liked about this set:Besides the 5 silicone ear cushions, it also comes with a pair of Comply foam tips;  these are really comfortable to use.The set also comes with a lightweight plastic carrying case which seems ideal for traveling.I'm very happy with The Ultimate Ears 500vi.  It is a great multifunctional headset at a good price."], "Gamma": [0.12499547004699707, 0.1250002533197403, 0.1250002533197403, 0.1250002533197403, 0.1250002533197403, 0.1250002533197403,
