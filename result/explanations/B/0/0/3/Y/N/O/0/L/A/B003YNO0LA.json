I love the white color and the sleek look of it.  It accommodates several phone jacks at the very end of it but one of the best traits is that it provides that last outlet with extra room for a larger box like head (ac adapter) like the ones you would plug in from a scanner or speakers.It has this warranty offer that I have never seen with any other and I love the fantastically long power cord which enabled me to go around the headboard of a queen bed and still have access to all the outlets. Never had one that could do that before and I didn't miss the struggle!", "I am using this as a power strip for a spare computer system (not my main workstation).  It works well as a power strip.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on how well this unit can protect against a power surge, because I will not risk damaging any of my computers on a simulated power surge, and we do not get too many lightning storms in San Francisco.  We occasionally get power outages, but we have not had since I've received this unit.I'll comment on the Pros and Cons of this strip.Pros:- Seven outlets allows for plugging a single PC + accessories (PC, monitor, speakers, printer, external HD, desktop lamp, and cell phone).  My cell phone charger occupies the bottom plug.  The only place I can put the plug without interfering with the other outlets.- Recessed power switch prevents me from accidentally stepping on (and switching off) the power strip.- $75K equipment warranty, in case electronic devices are damaged by surge or spike in power (ie. lightning).- Child-proof safety covers for plugs.  A definite plus if you have a little one.- Surge protection of up to 2000 Joules.  Everyone talks about lightning strikes to be the primary cause of power surges.  In fact, the cause of most common power surges are downed power lines, short circuits, tripped circuit breakers, and a sudden change in electricity usage.  This could be caused by the on/off cycle of a large appliance on the same power line, i.e. a refrigerator or a dryer.  Sometimes a nearby building or factory can also cause a power surge.  In most homes, a rating of 600 joules is sufficient.  For higher-end electronics, 2000 Joules is recommended.Cons:- A little longer and wider than most of my other power strips/surge protectors.- Power cord could be a bit longer than six feet.  At least 8 would be nice, 12 would be great.- I had problems with my fax machine plugged into the phone jack.  It could not send or receive data, although when I plugged the fax directly to the phone jack (using the same wire), it sends and receives fine so it is not a problem associated with the fax or the fax line.  It may simply be a problem with my specific unit, but a problem nonetheless.Overall, it is a decent power strip.  I will have to take Belkin's word on its surge protection feature (plus the $75K connected equipment warranty).  Coupled with the price (~$25), it makes for a decent budget surge protector.For higher-end electronics, I use a New High Quality Monster Power Hts1000mkiii 8 Outlet Hts 1000 Mkiii Powercenter Clean Power Stage 2 Digital LED (SURGE PROTECTORS/IUPS)power strip.", "Build quality is pretty good with a heavy-duty cord. The 8-feet cord is enough length for hard to reach spots. There's 1 input and 2 output slots for phone lines.  I am always in need of multiple-outlet surge protectors as my place is filled with many different computer/digital equipment and this product fits the bill.", "\"Despite having 5 surge protectors in active use in my office at the moment, I haven't actually been able to test this against a real power surge... nor am I likely to do so for purposes of a review. That said, here are some highlights:Pros:* Easy-to-read light tells you whether your power strip is grounded or not (first time I personally have ever seen that feature on a power strip)* Has a recessed on/off switch, so it's a little more difficult to bump on accident (although I still have to turn all my plugs at a 90 degree angle to the floor because my cats like to step on them, and this one does click on/off fairly easily)* Low-profile plug where the power strip plugs into the wall - helpful for tight spaces behind desks, and the cord juts out to the bottom/right at about 45 degrees, so you can actually use this in the top spot of a normal paired outlet without blocking the lower outletCons:* Only supports one large plug (and you can see from the picture the direction the rest of them have to be oriented). Honestly, this is a huge drawback for me since normally 1/2 to 1/3 of the plugs I use need a little extra space.Neutral:* Includes child-safety covers that aren't easy to open/close, but easy enough with the metal end of an plug* Includes one phone \"\"input\"\" and two \"\"output\"\" spots (although I use VOIP and a wireless phone, so it's a non-issue for me)* $75,000 for coverage to damaged equipment SOUNDS like a great thing, but ultimately is probably more marketing than anything else, because it has a ton of caveats, like:......... After damages, you have to ship the surge protector AND all damaged equipment to Belkin at your own expense......... The damaged equipment you ship in MUST be accompanied by a receipt showing what you paid for it (so if I've lost the receipt for my years-old Dell, and don't have a receipt at all for the machine that was a gift from my husband's office, I'm out of luck)......... ALL wires (even internet/modem) leading into equipment must pass through the surge protector......... Belkin may chose to repair instead of replace, and then you have to pay for cost of shipping to/from the repair center......... Doesn't cover damage due to _low_ voltage conditions (like brown-outs)......... They won't just give you $75K; they'll only give you \"\"fair market value of the damaged equipment OR original purchase price of the equipment, whichever is less\"\" (and not incidental costs like lost business while your machine was out of service)......... All damage claims must be made within 15 days from the date of the Occurrenceso the warranty isn't bad per se, but quite a hassle, and maybe not as impressive as you might originally assume.\"", "Belkin products have provided me with years of reliable, trouble-free operations and for this reason, nearly all of the 10+ surge protectors around my house are made by them. This product is made of ABS plastic and has a very thick heavy-duty cord like all the other Belkins. It sports an attractive streamlined bar shape and duo-toned grey/white coloring, but aside from the styling, it's pretty much like any ordinary surge protector. The LED is a pleasant green when on. The plug lies almost flush against the wall, making it easy to hide behind furniture.A few design considerations to think about: The slots are not spaced apart far enough if you plan on connecting bulky AC adapter bricks to it. Because of the vertical orientation, each adapter would overlap the one below it, except for the bottom slot, which is spaced further away. For normal 2 or 3 pronged plugs, the spacing is perfectly adequate. Secondly, this surge protector is slim, but overly long at 15 inches tall, considering it only has 7 outlets. Belkin could've shaved off a few inches from the top where the ON/OFF switch is by relocating that button to the side or making it horizontal. Lastly, I didn't really care for is the feel of the power switch. It has a springy give before it clicks (imagine a diving board). I prefer a very strong toggle.The back has 2 holes for mounting onto nail heads on a wall. Because of the orientation of the nail holes, it can only be mounted securely with the cord facing right.This is a very solidly-constructed surge protector, but consider the form factor if space is a concern. If you are looking for a different plug configuration and more space-saving design, I recommend the8 Outlet Compact Surge 2130J.", "I've been a Belkin consumer for years, and this is a very well-made, sturdy and reliable surge protector.While I'm not using it for any telephone application right now, when I get my fax machine up and running, I will use it in that application.Highly recommended.", "\"Gearing up for Fall storm season* I decided to pick up this surge protector to replace one \"\"the newest collegiate\"\" ran off with. (Our electronics obviously are not as important as his.) It is a perfectly nice cord, 7 outlets, one supporting a over-sized three prong, recessed on/off switch, ground light, low profile plug, child safety covers (I need an anti-theft device obviously), phone input, 2 outputs. Nice cord. That said, I am taking one star off because there is only one over-sized three prong outlet and it would have been nice to have one more at least.If, heaven forbid, we have another natural disaster involving power surges I will let you know if this saves our bacon.Recommended.*We have had some humdingers around here the past few years.\"", "I almost couldn't get this out of its box fast enough to put it to use in my workshop. For one it has a nice long heavy duty power cord and even though it has a grounded plugin, the prongs are at a 90 degree angle to the cord and the plug head is rotated 45 degrees so that it doesn't block the other outlet, and it hangs flat against the wall. For another it has 7 outlets instead of the usual 6 and they are spaced slightly farther apart than they usually are. Since I don't really have a use for the phone connections on it there isn't anything I can say about them. I'm putting this to use in my workshop and going to mount it at the back of my main workbench. I'll have to come back and add how it works out with the different power tools that I will use with it. But for now as I'm finishing the inside of my new workshop I've been using it with my skill saw and have the window unit air conditioner plugged into it along with the radio and I haven't had any problems with it yet.", "There are many brands of surge protectors and most are perfectly OK, they are but are essentially interchangeable. The Belkin is similar to many I have already. It does have a greater surge rating than most (2280 joules) and a longer cord than most (8 ft), but it does not stand out as being much better.  It is perfectly acceptable, but it is not clearly better than others. Hence 4 stars.", "\"This is a sturdy surge protector/power strip that is not going to break or come apart on you, and it does have some interesting features, but the design could be better.Cons:*Only one of the outlets is spaced far enough apart from the other outlets to accommodate an oversized plug.  For most of the things I need an outlet strip for, I could only use about four of the outlets.*The clamping voltage (the spike at which the protection will kick in and block a surge) is 500V (the lower the better).  This is the minimum requirement (maximum voltage spike) for the UL to allow a device to be called a surge protector (the other UL-defined levels are 330V and 400V).  If you have very sensitive and/or expensive equipment, you probably will want better protection.*The attached protective caps can be snapped out, rotated and slid over, and then snapped back in to block the holes.  I would not consider this to be adequate as a child safety feature due to the fact that it is very difficult to use (thus it likely to not be used consistently), and a kid with a bobby pin could probably still get it in there.  I guess it's better than nothing, and it would (if you go to the trouble of using it), as they suggest, help keep out debris in unused plugs.  But I've never really worried about that, anyway.Pros:*The on/off switch is recessed, making it far less likely that you'll accidentally trip it.*You can pass a phone line through the strip for protection, and it has two phone-line outlets.*The cord is heavy duty.*The back of the strip has slots for mounting it on screws (not included).*There is an indicator light to warn you if your wall outlet isn't properly grounded.  This shouldn't often be a problem, but I used to live in a 100-year-old house, where this would have been kind of handy.Overall, this product is just \"\"okay\"\" as both a power strip and as a surge protector.  For the price (currently $21), I would have expected it to be a little better.\"", "Like everyone else, every outlet in my home has a surge protector that has an added bonus of extra plugs with juice, ready to flow!  This latest one...well...it works like the rest.  And it comes with a telephone protection (yes, those RJ11 plugs.  Remember those?)  And it doubles as a telephone line splitter, free of charge!  (One input, 2 output jacks.)Overall, this strip is what you'd expect.  There are a bunch of plugs, one of which is slightly offset from the rest, ideally for the huge, overheating powerbrick you have to use for some obscure little piece of electronic.  If you have more than one of those, you may want to bump up to the next model, 'cause this guy will fit one of them - any more and you'll be covering up the remaining 6 plugs.As far as the rest of it goes - the cable is sturdy and long, and its own plug fortunately only covers one wall outlet.But how do you really know if this is a good surge protector or not?  Well, you test it out!  After spending weeks creating a hybrid of the infamous Tesla Coil that generated more voltage than a lightning strike, I focused the reticle on my wall jack and hoped for the best.  City-wide blackouts notwithstanding, the experiment was a success.  The power generated was sufficient: the surge protector itself was a molten pile of acrid plastic, but everything plugged into it was still functioning!  However, I would not recommend trying that at home.Would recommend...but not really any more or less than (name brand) competitors.  (The cheaper ones are cheaper for a reason - and they usually smell like an industrial fire from the moment you plug them in.)", "I appreciate the device warranty. I like the amount of surge protection enough to trust it with my laptops. But what I really love is the giant power button which saves me money.It's also made of solid, quality plastic, and has a pleasing matte finish. Love it.", "Its difficult to review a surge protector as its effectiveness cannot really be measured until you get a power surge.  Will your device survive?  Sorry folks, I cannot answer that question for you.  What I can answer is that this seems to be a well made surge protector.This surge protector features 7-outlets.  Has a grounded indicator light.  One input, and two output jacks for phone.Each outlet is oriented vertically, and evenly spaced with exception of the last outlet that has a tad bit more space for those space hogging plugs.  In my experience, due to the design of many plugs, many vertically oriented outlets are wasted.  Plugs take up too much space vertically.  If the outlets were horizontal, it would cut down on wasted outlets.The plug from this that goes into the wall is low profile that goes down from the wall outlet.  This is a good sign, as you can more easily place it behind furniture.The surge protector I received has an 8-foot cord, but Belkin also has a 4, 6, and 12 foot version to suit your needs.  The power button is recessed, which may reduce the risk of accidentally stepping on it and inadvertently shut off all your electronics.Overall, this surge protector isn't BAD, but aside from the ground indicator lights, and the different length of cords, it doesn't really set itself apart from any other surge protector I've purchased in the past 15 years.", "This seems to be a well built surge protector with a 12 ft heavy-duty 14 gauge 3-prone power cord. It comes with 1-in, 2-out RJ11 surge protected telephone output connectors.However, this unit only has a 2440 Joule energy rating (Amazon shows a typo of showing a 2000 Joule rating). The similar priced 12 outlet Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge protector has a 4320 Joule rating. Something which we should consider as this would be somewhat limited on the amount of equipment to plug into this box.", "the Belkin 7-Outlet Surge Protector with Telephone protection doesn't look much different than other surge protectors, and probably doesn't work any different than they do either.  And until we have a major lightning storm to test it on, I can't speak to its ability to protect my precioius electronics from an electrical surge.  But what I can speak to is ease of use and they hit the target here.  The outlets are all lined up in a neat little row, so the plugs don't all get in each other's way.  The cords are all sent off in the same direction, making them easier to tie together with little twisties if you like.  There are SEVEN, which is about the minimum I need in my office for the computer, printer, external drive, and multiple chargers.  And it will protect the phone too!  All in all, a great value.  Highly recommended.", "I am a musician and want only the best surge protectors for my expensive music gear. This baby does the job. It is sturdy, has a long power cord that is also sturdy, and even has jacks for phones if you use it for the office. Totally recommend this product for anyone who needs a great surge protector. Don't get me wrong, I haven't used it during a thunderstorm - I'm not stupid and I understand how lightening works. But for power surges that stupid electric companies have, I have no doubt that this protector will do the job and withstand them. It even has a light to tell you if your line is not grounded - way cool. So, go out and buy this - you won't be disappointed.", "The build quality is very good and the unit feels solid and should last. However, plug intervals are narrow so if you have plug-in power adapters such as those for routers, speakers, camera battery chargers, etc. this is not an ideal unit. If however you are feeding off computers, printers, and such this will work very well. There is also enough inter-plug space for the tiny cube power adapters that come with your iPhone. Note that the 8 feet power cord is long and might be what some require.", "I hadn't really stopped to consider whether a vertical orientation would matter, but it does. I have far too many oversized plugs, and this will not accomodate more than one, which means that if I want to use a second oversized plug, I have to block an extra outlet.I do like that it lights up to show that it's grounded, and that it seems to be heavy-duty and well made. I did have one power surge today and all is well.", "The Belkin Surge Protector 7 Outlet with Telephone Protection looks like most power outlet strips, but packs in a few great extra features.  The sliding covers are my favorite feature as I have a young child at home; and if you don't use them, they are completely unobtrusive.  The sliding covers are hard enough to slide that a child won't be able to, but easy enough to take just a second or two using one of the prongs of a power connector.  Other features include protection for your teleophone line, rear holes for wall mounting, extra space for the bottom-most outlet and led lights for power AND ground.Overall, this is a sturdy, tough outlet strip that will protect your gear with a peace-of-mind $75k guarantee on connected components and a lifetime limited warranty on the surge protector.  The weight and materials are all great and withstood some rough treatment from me, so it a bulky and heavy device compared to others.  The cord is quite thick, which could be a con for some people, but it also means it will take a lot of abuse too.  My only gripe is that the power switch at the top of the unit is quite easy for a toddler or pet to hit despite it being recessed into the device enough to prevent most adults from accidentally losing power.  I would have preferred more resistance on the switch or a sliding switch.", "For most people a Surge Protector is a necessary fixture for their electronic equipment.  Surge Protectors have been part of my life for quite a few years now and for the most part we pay little attention to them.  We expect them to work as designed and are never quite sure if they will.Here are the features which I found useful about this Surge Protector.1. It has a recessed on/off switch to help prevent accidentally activating the on/off switch.  Excellent feature.2. It has a LED indicator to let you know that the surge protector is working and a separate LED indicator to let you know that the protector is grounded.  Excellent feature.3. It has a low-profile wall outlet plug.  Good feature.4. There are accommodations for plugging in seven different pieces of equipment.  However only one is spaced far enough apart from the others to accommodate the larger plugs - for chargers, etc.  I think it would have been much better to have at least two large plug blocks.  Could be improved on the large block plugs.5. The phone outlets plugs are at the bottom of the protector and clearly marked for input/output.  I like the location and really like the way the outlets are clearly marked.6. The packaging says the protector offers 2,000 Joules of protection.  However I have no idea what that really means to my computer/monitor, etc.  Could be improved.7. There is a lifetime warranty and $75,000 connected equipment warranty.  Makes you feel secure.8. There is a safety feature which allows the inlet plugs to be closed to prevent anything (like staples, paperclips) from falling into the plug or small children sticking things into the plug.  Unfortunately the sliding parts are a bit difficult to slide.  Great feature but a little difficult to use.Surge Protectors have come a long way since the early models.  This one has a lot of great features.  There are some things which could be improved.  All in all, a real improvement.", "This is a quality surge protector with a really long, heavy duty cord.  Six of the seven outlets are spaced normally while the seventh outlet is spread out from the others to give you flexibility with what you plug into it.One thing to be aware of; this unit has a low-profile plug that runs the cord straight down from the outlet.  This means that if you plug this into the top power outlet, the cord will obstruct the outlet below.  If you have two of these, you can't plug them into the same outlet.  For this reason, I prefer the low-profile plugs that angle off at a 45 degree angle or have a swivel movement.The protector can also protect a phone line and includes a splitter capability (one plug input yields two plugs of output).", "This is a 7 outlet surge protector designed for home use.  This isn't your Grandma's surge protector.  It is streamlined and armed with features we all have felt were needed in a surge protector.First of all it has a 6 foot power cord.  The norm in the industry seems to be 3 feet max.  It has 7 outlets.  6 of them are spaced equally about 1/2 inch apart and the last one at the bottom is one inch away from the 6th one to accommodate those bulkier adapters.  While this is a nice feature I would have liked to see at least one other of the 6 outlets set apart to accommodate another of those bulkier adapters.  There are two indicator lights...one for Protected and one for Not Grounded.  The wall plug in is a low profile style so it can fit in tight spaces and behind furniture.  The outlets have sliding safety covers that keep dust and debris out of the unused outlets.  The unit also features a Phone-Line Protection which I guess is a bonus especially if you are running a fax line but not so much a necessity in today's world?  Another nice feature not usually found on surge protectors is the mounting holes on the back.  These allow you to easily mount the surge protector to a wall or baseboard.Belkin offers a Lifetime warranty and up to $75,000 Connected Equipment Warranty on this particular model which means if your equipment gets fried while plugged into the surge protector they will replace the equipment.  Reading the limitations and exclusions however makes one think that you will have a hard time proving your loss was due to the product itself.  They kind of cover their bases like most companies.Since I have only had it for 3 days I haven't had a chance to test it during any of our crazy Heartland America summer storms but will certainly let you know with an edit if it doesn't do its job during a surge of any kind.  In all, if I were to go to a store and compare all the different surge protection models I would easily choose this Belkin model over any others.", "The Advanced Surge Protector is a great replacement for ugly power strips with short cords, plugs that can't be used, and toggle power switches that are easily, accidentally turned off.Pros:Light and dark gray, sturdy power strip with a 6 foot cord and the following features:-7 outlets, including 1 special outlet for a large power adapter that would usually block another outlet-Large recessed power switch = no accidental shutdowns-Indicator lights: Surge Protection , Not grounded-Difficult to slide individual outlet safety covers - keeps kids, pets and dust out of unused outlets-Phone line protection for 1 input and 2 outputs-Low Profile plug that fits in tight spaces.-MountableCons:None observedBottom Line: Worth considering when getting or replacing power strip surge protectors.", "This Belkin surge protector is great. The long cord makes it stand apart from the average power strip because you can actually position it where you need it rather than having to position your electronics to reach the strip.PROS: Long cord, phone jack connections on the bottom; seven outlets instead of only six; indicator to show if outlet is grounded or not grounded; plug that goes into the wall is flat and cord is positioned diagonally so it stays clear of other outlet; quality build; nice aesthetic design.CONS: Outlets are vertical, so if you have a power supply on the plug, you lose some outlets (the last outlet is spaced lower than the others, but not enough to plug a power supply-connected outlet above it); on/off switch is big and a little too easy to accidentally toggle.Overall, four stars. The pros far outweigh the cons and the cons are common to many surge protectors. It lost one star from me because of the too-easy-to-toggle switch. By no means a deal-breaker since these are usually tucked far away from an accidental click.As a bonus, if you live in a house with older wiring, you can use the indicator on the strip to tell you if an outlet is properly grounded or not.", "Belkin BSV701-08-WM Belkin 7-Outlet Surge Protector with 8-Feet Cord  (3- pronge) is a fantastic product. Has weight and is by no means cheaply made. I only wish the outlets had more space between to maximize all outlets. Overall, a fair price at $21.00 with Amazon Prime shipping.", "I am pretty happy with this unit. The cord is plenty long, the unit is slim and looks nice, and it has worked perfectly so far.My favorite thing about it actually is the look. Most of my old outlets are, well, old, and a yellowing gray I absolutely hate (but they still work!). I guess I'll have to see how well the Belkin holds up its white color.The one annoyance is that, as you'll see by the product picture, the plugs all face each other. Good luck plugging in more than one electric piano, Apple computer, battery charger, or so forth. As far as outlet design, I use a squid (like thisPower Sentry) on my desktop, as unfortunately the Belkin can't accommodate everything I need it for. Also the outlet plug (the pronged part, not the cord) is about .5cm too large to fit between my desk and my wall.All in all it's a good unit, just make sure you know what you need it for.", "Pros:(1) The 12-foot cord is AWG (American Wire Gauge) 14, making it safer for heavier-draw appliances (the majority of extension cords are AWG 16 which I consider kinda risky).(2) The plug, which is molded to be flat behind furniture, is offset. This intelligent design prevents the flat plug from blocking the second outlet, which can happen with polarized three-prong plugs.(3) Has sliding safety covers for outlets for child safety and dust protection.(4) Offers surge protection (obviously), phone line protection and $75,000 connected equipment warranty.(5) Has recessed on/off toggle which can be convenient - I find it particularly so when shutting appliances down either for my absence or to eliminate phantom current draw.(6) Has mounting slots on back. You will need to find two screws whose heads fit.(7) Has lights indicating protection and/or improper grounding.(8) Is very attractive with dark gray cord and side trim; very light gray face.Cons: NONE", "My first impression on opening the box was that this power strip is a lot bigger than it looks in the illustration.  Construction is fairly robust, and the power cable is really hefty (also a bit longer than I'm used to seeing on these things). The slide-over socket covers are nice if you've got rug rats crawling around your feet.But the good points are all undone by the orientation of the sockets.  If you look closely at the illustration, you can see the connectors run parallel with one another.  Nearly all of my electronics seem to have wall warts (I'm not crazy about that fact, but that's the way it is).  On this Belkin unit, at least two positions will be taken by each wall wart, meaning this is really a 3 or 4-outlet strip. Rotating the plug orientation by 90 degrees (and perhaps eliminating one plug) would have made a huge practical difference in the usability of this unit.If all of your electronics have internal power supplies, this might be a good choice.  But if you're a wall-wart kind of person, you should probably look elsewhere.", "What can you say about surge protectors? It works! I've always bought Belkin back up batteries for my computers as I live in an area with frequent brown outs, so I know the quality is good. Everything is good, except for the plugs are oriented in a way that I don't think I can get all my large plugs on there. If they were rotated so that the ground prong was off to the side, I think I could put small and large on their but it looks like this one can only take one large and the rest small. Luckily, where I'm using it is not a problem. In my office it would be a problem as almost all my plugs there are pretty large.So, quality good but with a drawback....", "Belkin is a brand that I have trust and the one that I've turned to when  purchasing surge protectors over the past several years.  This particular surge protector offers the Belkin quality that I have come to expect and has a few features that I particularly appreciate, including:- Recessed power on/off button so that I don't accidentally turn it off (or my little ones aren't irresistibly tempted to turn it off)- It has a long cord (12 feet)- Seven outlets, though only one accommodates and adapter (this just means that when you use the others for an adapter, you lose the use of one or two outlets)- Lifetime warranty and $75,000 warranty for any connected equipment- A safety feature which includes tiny covers over the holes of the outlets when they aren't being used this is a childproof feature in that it prevents children from sticking anything into an open hole (you just slide them to open the hole, but this isn't something a toddler can really do -it's a little difficult to slide them)", "This is a good looking power strip with many beneficial functions and some drawbacks as well. Build quality is great and colors are pleasing to the eye. Surge protection and warranty are satisfactory as well.Beneficial functions:1) Built-in sliding covers exist for individual socket. This provides protection for (and from) unused sockets.2) 7 sockets compared to usual 6 sockets on most similar power strips.3) 2 sockets are spaced so that plug-in adapters (phone, charger, etc.) can be used without blocking other outlets on the strip.4) Phone line protection.5) Toggle switch and light indicators6) Very long cable. In my case, this is somewhat a disadvantage because I need only 3' cable.Drawbacks:1) Bigger in size2) Recommended for use only in home office or in kitchen. Not recommended for home entertainment systems", "I got this power strip/surge protector to use when traveling. I have found that, when traveling abroad it is usually easier to use one power adapter and plug all your equipment into it. This way, I can charge my camera batteries, kindle, I-pad, my husband&#8217;s shaver, etc. all at the same time.On non-American flagged ships or river cruisers there is usually only one American plug and it&#8217;s usually inconveniently hidden under the desk or night table or behind the bed. If you travel with your own outlets, you only have to connect it once and from there on; you just have your plugs within easy reach and can charge and re-charge your peripherals. With an 8-foot cord there is enough leeway to power your C-PAP during the night. So, for my purposes, this slim and fairly light weight unit works perfectly well.(Note: be sure to pack it in your carry-on baggage. A surge protector tends to look a bit suspicious in checked baggage and your bag will be opened.)The fact that this model suits my purposes doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s particularly well designed for general use since the plugs are fairly close together. Only the bottom plug allows a little bit more room for a large plug (like a camera battery charger). You have to carefully plan how you&#8217;re going to organize the order of the plugs and almost have to skip every other plug if they are anything other than ordinary two-prong plugs. Five at the same time is the best I&#8217;ve been able to pull off.The unit has child-proofing covers built in as well as phone jacks. While these features are of no particular interest to me, they might be to others.So far, I have not had a power outage or had occasion to notice any variation in power that would allow me to verify the &#8220;surge protection&#8221; feature but I tend to trust it since I have several other Belkin surge protectors that have never failed me."], "Gamma": [0.022571014240384102, 0.9548578858375549, 0.022571014240384102], "Beta": [[8.017100481083617e-05, 0.04833664000034332, 0.0001700303255347535, 0.2733684182167053, 0.00016213070193771273, 0.04736964777112007, 0.0001784177584340796, 0.0001204648579005152, 0.0009248070418834686, 0.011037750169634819, 0.0027236510068178177, 0.249714657664299, 0.0002745033707469702, 0.010037163272500038, 0.0007987639401108027, 0.00014149492199067026, 0.04331374168395996, 0.19782419502735138, 6.550178659381345e-05, 0.04594791680574417, 6.953212869120762e-05, 0.00014415608893614262, 0.026070645079016685, 0.00019881916523445398, 0.004354910925030708, 0.035423122346401215, 0.0002111499779857695, 9.615531598683447e-05, 0.000508218421600759, 6.347809539875016e-05, 0.00020372180733829737, 6.600312190130353e-05], [2.038538696069736e-05, 0.041685450822114944, 4.3227613787166774e-05, 0.27386474609375, 4.1223971493309364e-05, 0.04108218848705292, 0.0002845269627869129, 3.064034171984531e-05, 0.00025533948792144656, 0.003825909225270152, 0.003250668989494443, 0.26357027888298035, 0.0004505503748077899, 0.01216098666191101, 0.0011311635607853532, 3.5988949093734846e-05, 0.04628220573067665, 0.18501734733581543, 0.00011248580267420039, 0.057343706488609314, 1.7803968148655258e-05, 3.666881821118295e-05, 0.03053540550172329, 0.0002796565240714699, 0.007318907883018255, 0.03031912073493004, 5.36861116415821e-05, 0.00014811652363277972, 0.0007060444331727922, 1.6156845958903432e-05, 6.25573520665057e-05, 1.6850350220920518e-05], [8.017100481083617e-05, 0.04833664000034332, 0.0001700303255347535, 0.2733684182167053, 0.00016213070193771273, 0.04736964777112007, 0.0001784177584340796, 0.0001204648579005152, 0.0009248070418834686, 0.011037750169634819, 0.0027236510068178177, 0.249714657664299, 0.0002745033707469702, 0.010037163272500038, 0.0007987639401108027, 0.00014149492199067026, 0.04331374168395996, 0.19782419502735138, 6.550178659381345e-05, 0.04594791680574417, 6.953212869120762e-05, 0.00014415608893614262, 0.026070645079016685, 0.00019881916523445398, 0.004354910925030708, 0.035423122346401215, 0.0002111499779857695, 9.615531598683447e-05, 0.000508218421600759, 6.347809539875016e-05, 0.00020372180733829737, 6.600312190130353e-05]]}
