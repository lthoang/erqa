"], "reviews": ["I've been using this for 5 1/2 weeks now and I can't say that there has been much difference. I have definitely noticed a pleasant tightness and softness of my face when I touch my skin. That's good, but I've had four or five minor blemishes which isn't normal for me and on my left cheek where I sometimes have redness using this kit has actually made the redness a bit more pronounced, not taken it away. I haven't noticed any change in the eye area. I should note that I'm 30 and have good, youthful skin, no lines or wrinkles to start off with.I tend to use more environmentally and healthy beauty products such as cosmetics without parabens, ect. I didn't like that I get a definite smell of like motor oil or something from a garage when I use the gel serum. I thought it might just be me so I had my husband sniff it and he smelled the same thing. I do like that the moisturizer has spf 30 in it and it is very moisturizing. But I can't say that I would get this again.", "\"Now in my early 40s, I am lucky enough to have no major problems with wrinkles so far, although of course, some aging is beginning to show.  However, I was mainly interested in this Starter System for the inclusion of an Eye product.  I struggle with dark under eye circles, and according to the box, the eye cream included in this kit is \"\"clinically proven\"\" to produce \"\"noticeable improvement\"\" in reducing puffiness and dark circles by the end of one week; by the end of four weeks, these results are supposed to increase to \"\"significantly noticeable.\"\"So, I began using this system about a month prior to my 42nd birthday.  There are three total products:  1) a serum, which is supposed to be applied over the face, neck, and entire eye area, 2) an activating cream, also designed to be applied over the entire face and neck, and 3) an eye activating cream, designed to be used around the entire eye area.  The instructions did not specify exactly when to apply the products, but because the activating cream was labeled \"\"Day\"\" and contained SPF, I choose to use this regimen in the A.M. only.Here were my initial impressions:The serum comes out of the tube a medium gray color, which seems a bit odd at first, but it does disappear into the skin.  It has a silky feel but seems to be easily absorbed.  The activating cream has a light, pleasant scent (it fades fairly quickly for those who don't like scented items); the cream itself is fairly rich, but again, it is absorbed quickly.  The eye cream, on the other other hand, is significantly thinner, which was unexpected (I would have thought it would be the other way around).  I preferred the pumps of the two creams to the serum's tube.WHAT I LIKED:All three products seemed to absorb into my skin well, and they didn't leave my oily-prone skin feeling greasy (although I used the products during the spring; it may have been different in the summer).  Similarly, I didn't seem to break out any more often than normal while using this system.  My skin generally felt fairly smooth and looked decent in appearance for the duration that I sampled this kit, although I did get some dryness around my mouth towards the end of the month.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:First, I began running out of the serum before the other two products.  I emailed the Neutrogena web site, and they replied to say that I could continue using the other two products alone and still see \"\"some effects.\"\"  But this leads to my second complaint:  I didn't see ANY noticeable effects!  Yes, my skin generally felt soft, but no more so than from using any good moisturizer.  I certainly would not say that I saw improved skin tone/minimized signs of discoloration or improvement in fine lines/wrinkles, both of which are supposedly \"\"clinically proven\"\" to be \"\"noticeable results\"\" after just one week (and should have been even more pronounced after a full month).  Similarly, I can't say that I saw any of the other claimed benefits of this system, such as lifting the look of sagging skin and improving the look of facial contours/and definition.So, in the end, the BEST that I can say about this Starter Kit is that it seemed to act as a decent moisturizer during the time I used it (about a month, which is how long the products lasted).  But there is no way I can recommend paying this much for a set of three products that promises so much more; there are certainly better and less expensive moisturizers out there.\"", "\"This is going to be a relatively short review because there's not a lot to say about it.  The short of it is that there was no visible improvement other than what near-term improvement that you're going to see using any sort of lotion on your skin.I gave it 3 stars for \"\"the benefit of the doubt\"\".  But I personally wouldn't buy the stuff.  Doesn't seem to do much, if anything.  Of course, according to the manufacturer, something like 91% apparently noticed improvement, so if that's true, I'm obviously in the minority,\"", "I have been using the Neutrogena Clinical eye lifting wrinkle treatment system for about 6 weeks. Honestly, I can't really say that I can tell a difference in my skin but I have already been using the Olay ProX series and before that I have been using the Olay Regenerist line for awhile so I don't really think I would see much of a difference.The Neutrogena kit contains a gel serum that is gray but goes on clear and like other serums, makes your skin feel like silk. The kit also contains an activating cream with a spf30 and the only active ingredients listed are regular ones that are in sunscreen so I'm not sure if the activating cream is anything more than sunscreen (I thought the exact same thing about the Olay ProX moisturizer.) The final product in the kit is an eye activating cream. You only need the tiniest bit around the eyes but mine always plops out a bunch and I feel like I'm wasting it but I just go ahead and put it on my face all over.Neutrogena claims that even after one use, your skin feels softer and smoother. The serum does make your skin feel silky but so does other serums. If you haven't included one in your facial routine, I highly recommend one. Olay Regenerist has the #1 moisturizer, #1 night cream, and #1 serum. I use these myself regularly.Overall, I like the Neutrogena Clinical. It feels nice on and I would probably purchase in the future. I'm just not sure these pricier wrinkle creams do much more for my wrinkles than less expensive ones but I like how they make my skin feel and I want to do all I can do for my skin.", "and thought I'd get this for my wife to try.  Of course there was no hidden agenda or meaning behind me giving this to her, but for brief second, it was kind of awkward when I told her I got her some wrinkle cream... :)Needless to say, we laughed it off and in the end she was pleasantly surprised with the results.  So coming from her, she is very happy and recommends it to you!", "When I first got the product I was taken aback by how large the packaging was, and then how small the actual product was. More than a month later and I still have product to use! I was really surprised. It doesn't take much to see results and this system is a pretty good value.The serums are really easy to use. Its not a complicated process and I only had to read the instructions once. The texture is velvety and leaves my skin feeling really great all day long. I like that it has SPF built in, that eliminates adding another product to my morning routine. This wears nicely under makeup and doesn't interfere with makeup application, simply wait 5 minutes while you brush your teeth and then go right ahead and apply makeup.My skin really does feel firmer and somewhat lifted. I noticed a healthy glow after a few days of use. I will be adding this product to my long term morning routine, I have been really happy with the results.", "I'm still young enough that I definitely have no need to run out to the store for StriVectin, but at the same time I cycle long distances and the sun and wind take their toll. Genetically, I have dark under eye circles coupled with very thin skin there that drives me up a wall. I use MAC eye cream, which contains caffeine. However the price tab for that teeny tiny tube is hard to swallow. So, this at first glance seems like a great alternative.Pros:1) Sun block - granted it's only SPF 152) Softens skin3) Eye cream works comparably well to my MAC cream4) Price5) I like the holder - it's unobtrusive but neatCons:1) I broke out! I never get pimples EVER - however, three weeks in and my skin was blotchy and I had pimples on my forehead and cheeks. I stopped for two days and my normal color returned, resumed...the blotching returned too. So, I had to stop using the face cream for this reason (eye cream okay, so it is definitely the face activating cream)2) It smells like perfume - I'm pretty scent sensitive, I hate it3) The whole apply one first then apply an activating cream gets old4) You have to use very little or the grey cream seems to pill up under make-up5) Instructions are shoddy - can I use it with primer?I do think it has worked remarkably well for tightening the skin under my eyes and reducing the appearance of dark circles. However, I don't think it did anything on my face (before the blotching); it may not have been long enough. I do not think it sat under my make-up well either. It just didn't absorb well. I was using Ole Henriksen truth serum and Ulta primer which felt light and sat well under make-up. I feel like this is heavy no matter how thing I try and spread it, and makes my make-up gummy and less attractive. Granted, to be fair, I have very light skin with some freckling.I did actually buy a new tube of the eye cream (Neutrogena has a rebate too, through 4/30/10). I plan on using it daily and saving the MAC cream for the weekends/special occasions.Bottom line: 4.5 stars for the eye cream, 2 stars for the face cream, Approx -.5 stars for having the two-step process. Some tightening and reduction of under eye circles with the eye cream. No improvement or tightening noted with the face cream - actually seemed to make forehead worry lines and laugh lines worse under make-up. Developed a sensitivity to the face cream (possibly due to the perfume?). I recommend the eye cream, and for that reason, the starter set might be a good initial purchase to see how it works for you.", "As far as removing wrinkles, maybe not, but this new Neutrogena Wrinkle Treatment System is pretty good stuff.  I have been only using it a couple of weeks now and I already feel a less defined look of line around my mouth and eyes.I use this everyday and it makes my face so soft and silky.  Watch it when putting on the eye cream though.  I accidently got some in my eyes and my eyes watered a bit the next day but that was it.  I am a fan of anything that helps my skin and makes me feel good!  This does that.", "I spent several weeks trying this product.  I gave it two stars because, while I do not think it met the hype - it is an ok skin cream.  Today, I went back to my all natural skin cream and the red areas on my face caused by this product are already going away.I have sensitive skin, so perhaps someone else might find it a better moisture system than I did.  It left my skin feeling slightly greasy and attracted more dust, pollen, etc.I'm happily paying twice the amount for something more natural.", "\"I liked the product in that it didn't cause an allergic reaction, and the ion serum gel did make my skin feel cleaner. The lotion was nice, and I like that it has the spf 30. It's one way for me to follow my doctor's recommendation that I wear sunblock daily. However, I never noticed any difference in the lines I have (\"\"crows feet\"\" and lines between my eyebrows). I'm not one to be fussed about wrinkles anyway so perhaps that could affect my impression of how well the product works or not.So would I buy it? Probably not, since wrinkle treatment is not a priority for me. But I would definitely look for and buy Neutrogena facial lotion with the spf sunblock. Skin cancer issues run in my family so I'm interested in lotion that protects my skin and does not cause an allergic reaction.\"", "Having tried some of the most expensive skin care brands available, I have come to the conclusion that Neutrogena offers the most for the money, and compares quite favorably to skin care products that cost four or five times more.  Though this is an expensive set for Neutrogena, itis a great collection.  The first step has an incredible texture - it is a grey cream that goes on your skin totally dry, leaving it feeling supple yet not greasy at all. Follow that up with the face or eye cream that has a creamy texture, but still leaves you feeling clean.  My one big complaint, the sizes are quite small.  You will like the feeling and use it up in no time.", "Saw this item and thought I'd give it a try.  Being around 40 now my skin doesn't seem to be as elastic as it once was and I certainly have wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as my forehead.  When I first opened the gel I was a bit surprised by its gray color, but it did go on smooth and made my skin seem soft.  I used it as suggested for 1 month, and while I could tell that I had it on and my skin felt soft to the touch I did not see a noticeable reduction in fine lines or wrinkles that the product claims to help with. I wouldn't recommend this product as a wrinkle treatment.", "\"I'm giving this four stars because even after a week I can see that the crow's feet under my eyes are tightening up. However, some of the cons tend to balance this out:Pro*Although it's pricey, they pretty much swear you will see results in a month, so it's not a huge investment financially or timewise to see if it works for you.*The creams smell like expensive salon products, so you'll feel/smell pampered at your bathroom sink.*My skin definitely looks brighter to me. Having said that, my 7-year-old asked me yesterday if it was hand cream. When I explained what the product was for and asked if I looked any younger, she could not stop laughing and yelled \"\"No!\"\" So, out of the mouths of babes. You probably won't get any miracles out of this.*Psychologically, I think if you're going to spend time dabbing goo on your face each and every day, you're probably going to take care of yourself in other ways: flossing, going to the gym, etc. So in general, it may prompt you to engage in self-care.*One of the tubes contains sunblock (I believe---see \"\"con\"\" comment regarding lack of info. on the tubes), so you automatically get that benefit (although it's hard to believe there could be enough protection from such a small dab of cream).*There's a cute little plastic holder to store your tubes in and they don't take up much room.Con*It's expensive and the bottles are miniscule. They are meant to last a month (I can't verify if they do, but I have been skipping my neck, because I suspect they do not). This means that if you were to keep buying the program, you'd be shelling out close to half a grand a year. By comparison, my eighty-year-old aunties don't look a day over sixty, and they've never used anything but Noxema. So you may be able to achieve the same results for a lot less.*One of the creams is grey. It does not feel natural to spread grey goo on your face. Also, it has a weird plastic feel, almost like a face mask product. This all  brings me to the next point:*As another reviewer noted, this is not an organic product. So if this is important to you, keep looking. Basically, you're putting chemicals on your skin, which does not appeal to me over the long-term.*There aren't many instructions on the tubes (because they're so small), so unless you memorize the \"\"instructions\"\" on the box, you're pretty much on your own. It seems to me the box called this a \"\"starter kit,\"\" which implies that we should be moving on to something else after a month, or maybe a set of larger tubes, but my DH threw out the box, so again, no more info.Bottom line: If you are interested, try it. One month won't break the bank. However, although I like it, I suspect I'll be moving on when the tubes run out, based on cost if nothing else.\"", "Wow what a wonderful product.....  Self Magazine turned me on to this incredible product when it listed it as a way to kick-start the production of collagen.  The copper and zinc in the cream-duo prompt cell signaling.  The product also features Tetrol-E to lift and firm skin.  I saw immediate results.  The cream also has a fascinating texture. Almost like a dewy powder.  It rolls onto my skin and absorbs immediately.  I prefer facial creams that do not have a scent and this one meets theh bill.", "This isn't a cheap system and the quantities included are minuscule and will probably last a month or so. Didn't really notice any extra skin firmness or diminished wrinkles and I stopped using it fairly quickly since I developed some redness and irritation.", "The first time I tried this product, I noticed immediately that I could feel the eye cream working.  No, it didn't wipe out all my wrinkles (ok I dont have any yet) but I can feel why this product would work - I could feel the cream tightening up the skin under my eyes.  It was a very strange  sensation.The entire package consists of three items  - the base serum, which goes on so silky smooth it's hard to believe it is a cream.  It is very light, and you only use a tiny bit.  It starts out a light grey color but the color does not show up on your skin.  Over the serum you add the face lotion and under-eye cream.  You can use this under your makeup just fine.My only gripe is the cost, but I notice that similar products on the shelves today cost just as much.  I trust the Neutrogena brand name and they tend to make products that are good for sensitive skin.  I have a lot of skin allergies but I didnt' have any problems  with it.", "\"Since my own skin is picture perfect and virtually impossible to improve, Mrs. Spudman agreed to try the Neutrogena Clinical Lifting System on her own face. I was an interested observer, photographer, and interviewer. At the beginning of the trial I took six close up photographs of the subject's face to compare to her face after treatment.Some thoughts of the volunteer subject:\"\"The product felt luxurious going on and seemed to make my face look smoother immediately after application.Using three separate tubes is too much bother considering the final results.\"\"\"\"I don't like doing the Neutrogena treatment at night because some nights I'm just too tired and not in the mood.\"\" A true statement.\"\"The first tube and the second tube felt good on the skin. Unfortunately by the next morning the effects were gone\"\"Invariably one tube is going to run out before the others. This happened to \"\"us.\"\"After a little over three weeks, I took follow up photographs of the same face on the same subject and compared the second set of pictures to the first set. I also compared the first set of photographs to the actual face post treatment.Our conclusion - Very little if any difference or improvement was perceived after studying the photographs and the subjects face. We won't be buying this product unless it goes on sale for half price. Then maybe.\"", "After using this product for about three weeks, I have noticed a difference around my aging eyes and smile line.  It might just be psychological, but I do feel a firmness in both places.  The cream has a light and attactive scent that will not compete with other products in your normal routine, though I do recommend waiting a couple minutes from application to putting on any foundation to avoid mixing the two products.  There is also sunscreen in the product, eliminating the need to add more products to your routine.The tubes are pretty small, but a little goes a long way."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05714374780654907, 0.0558503121137619, 0.05613507330417633, 0.04382668063044548, 0.058857884258031845, 0.057183798402547836, 0.0542718879878521, 0.055016662925481796, 0.05457548424601555, 0.05580399930477142, 0.059137169271707535, 0.05704457312822342, 0.060877636075019836, 0.054849136620759964, 0.05636686086654663, 0.05600544065237045, 0.052199751138687134, 0.0548538863658905]]}
