"], "reviews": ["As soon as I got this package I cooked it up because I was looking forward to eating something cheesey.  This is not that something!  It tastes fine as a speghetti but there is NO cheese flavor to it.  I ended up eating half a serving and discarding the rest because it did not meet my expectations...........of having a cheese flavor, yet alone a three cheese flavor.  If I wasn't expecting 'cheese', I would have given this product 5 stars but it disapointed me.  It cooked up easily after 10 minutes in boiling water and really tasted fine but I will not be buying this tortellini again.  It's made from white flower which is bad for diabetics and hyperglycemics.  The package I got really tasted fresh and had great texture but it did not satisfy my expectations of it from the name and description.  Try it yourself, it may be just what you are looking for.", "The fact that these tortellini need no refrigeration make them an essen tial staple in my pantry.  They are so easy to prepare and the result. Is delicious.  My only caveat is that in my house, they only fed 3 adults rather than 4!!", "The tortellini are smaller than I thought they would be or that I'm used to but after cooking and eating, I really didn't mind. The tortellini actually have a good amount of flavor by themselves and I tried various quick and easy preparations - all of which I was very happy with.Sausage (or any ground meat), ready made pasta sauce. The flavor of the tortellini can get overpowered from this preparation but I enjoyed it for a lighter preparation using a tomato based sauce over a cream sauce.Grated Parmigiano Reggiano, prosciutto/pancetta/bacon, lots of black pepper, some truffle oil. - Really amps up the flavor in a simple way, more about quality ingredients to beef up the fact that it isn't the best quality of pasta but the dish still tasted really good. If you add an egg, you can make a variation of a carbonara, which I did as well. Both were good.It makes a really solid and versatile pantry item when you don't feel like making an arduous meal or ordering in and a different option from the average pasta and sauce norms.", "I love having Barilla  Tortellini in my pantry for those busy nights when I need a easy supper or addition to meal. Make sure you cook this Torellini for the full time and double check in the cheese is cooked through. I just add a tablespoon on butter , toss & serve.  The pricing was better than in our local store.", "\"Barilla Three Cheese Tortellini is a great dinner.  This pasta is not frozen or refrigerated.  It can stay in your pantry, so I think it is quite convenient.  It seems to be about the same price as the frozen or refrigerated, but when it is on sale.  And with Amazon's subscribe and save, you can save a little more and have it delivered to your door (even more convenience!).About 6 servings are in each bag, at 230 calories a serving.  In each serving there is 7g of fat, 2g saturated fat, 45mg of cholesterol, 390 mg of sodium, 33g of total carbohydrates, 3g dietary fiber, 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.  Please note this product contains wheat, eggs, and milk.The taste is quite good.  The three cheeses are Swiss Emmenthal, Ricotta, and Grana Padano. I think the Grana Padano gives it a nice texture, while the Emmenthal and Ricotta keep it light.  It is OK plain, but I always prefer sauce.  For this sampling, I took the bag's recommendation: \"\"Tortellini is perfect when paired simply with melted butter or extra virgin olive oil, topped by a generous sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.\"\"  I melted 2 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup of oil and seasoned it with parsley and grated parmesan.  And I added one tablespoon of minced garlic for a very garlicky punch.  It gave the pasta a nice coating without saturating the noodles and making it soggy.  It was delicious.  And the sauce was super easy.  I could see how marinara could be good with these tortellini, but again I did not try it.  Plus sauce is really a matter of taste, so you should try what you like best.Preparation is very easy, too.  The longest part of the prep was boiling the water.  Once that was done, 10 minutes of boiling the tortellini is all there is left to do.  Toss the drained with your prepared sauce and serve.  It is a delicious!\"", "I love this product.  When you work long hours you don't want to spend a lot of time cooking at the end of the day.  This just takes minutes, and it's ready.  The nice thing is that you can store it in the cupboard to have handy for a quick meal.  I seasoned mine with butter, olive oil, and then sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top, and it turned out very tasty.  A nice convenient change of pace when you're in the mood for pasta.", "Sent as a gift they were highly appreciated, and since I did not partake in tasting this Barilla Three Cheese Tortellini , I can only attest to what the grateful recipient stated: Tasty! 4 Stars.", "\"The Barilla Three Cheese Tortellini is a great item to have a couple of bags on the pantry shelf for when you are in a rush and need to fix a meal. The package serves four and is very easy to make...place in 3-4 quarts of boiling water for 10-11 minutes and \"\"Voila\"\" a delicious side dish or add a grilled chicken breast and a salad and you have a whole meal in under 20 minutes. I just added butter and parmesan cheese to the cooked tortellini. The sauce does not come with this product so the choice of toppings is up to you. Being a family of 2 we had lots left over and I froze them for another meal. They freeze nicely and tasted just as good as the first time around when thawed.\"", "We eat a lot of pasta in our house and I am always glad to find quick meals that aren't just spaghetti noodles and a jar of Ragu.  I found this bagged pasta to be pretty good and I liked it with Bertolli Alfredo sauce.  It was enough for two adults and a child with some garlic bread.  I read on here a lot of people served it with chicken so if you have maybe four people or are really hungry that would be a good idea. I would buy this before I would get one of the refrigerated pastas just due to the convenience of keeping it on hand in the cabinet.", "I would not recommend this pasta.  The taste was ok, if a little bland.  However, the texture was very unpleasant.  The pasta itself got soft very fast, but the cheese filling inside remained in an unpleasant powder form.  I tried cooking it a little longer, thinking that the cheese might melt or start to dissolve or something, but it never happened.  I ended up eating slightly overcooked noodles, each of which was filled with a little ball of powdered cheese.  The cheese was gritty and tasted too strong.I like the idea of a cheese-stuffed pasta that you can store in the cupboard, but if this is the end result, I'm not interested.", "I love cheese tortellini, and for some reason it seems so much easier to make it from a bag of dry pasta than from a package of frozen. You do have to let it simmer for the recommended 10-11 minutes, or the water and oil might not soak all the way in and the cheese mix can be a little dry. Cooked properly, though, this pasta is absolutely delicious, either with just a little drizzle of olive oil, with pesto sauce or with marinara.", "The tortellini tastes great.  However, this product is definitely more trouble to fix than the Barilla or Hormel microwaveable packages.  It has to be boiled in a large pot of water.  I really prefer the much easier to use pasta packages that can just be put through a microwave for a few minutes.  I won't be buying this again.  However, I will continue to buy the Hormel and Barilla microwaveable dishes.  Those are really great.", "These were very easy and quick to make and tasted decent enough.  Nice when you want to make a quick meal.", "The Barilla Three Cheese Tortellini is a cheese filled pasta that is shelf-stable, without refrigeration, for about three months (check the package for expiration date.) This is an excellent item for the modern pantry. Very easy to prepare: Bring a pot of water to boil, add a little olive oil and salt, drop in the pasta. Let the water return to a boil, stirring occasionally, wait 10 minutes and test. Drain and serve. Pair this with a creamy white sauce and you're set to go. A note about servings: As a side dish, you can make four servings. However, as a pasta meal, two adults with good appetites can easily polish off the package. This tortellini is easy to prepare and very tasty. It contains ricotta, Emmentaler (Swiss) and Grana Padano (a relative of Parmesan.)", "\"My family and I love pasta, especially filled pasta! I cooked this just as the package said. Served it with our usual sauce and all three of us had the same reaction. It had a \"\"package\"\" taste to it and the pasta was \"\"rubbery\"\". We all really wanted to like it but, we just didn't.\"", "I like Barilla's products, and I usually purchase angel hair pasta or ditalini pasta, but I thought I would try their tortellini also, and I was not disappointed. Recommended when you just want to whip up something quick and satisfying. Very cheesy and nourishing.", "Word of warning here, make sure you read the instructions!  No, it's not hard to make (boil water and wait 10 or so minutes) but my tester didn't read anything and realized very quickly these balloon to roughly twice the size of what you see in the package (which, by the way, is almost always the case with dried pasta).The cheese mix in the middle is just enough to add a good flavor without being overwhelming but do keep in mind these are tortellini and not ravioli so the end result in much smaller (about the size of a penny).Those looking for a quick meal can add just butter or go whole hog (no pun intended) and add sausage or meatballs along with a nice marinara sauce (may be too cheesy to add a white cheese sauce on top).Overall, makes a good inexpensive and quick family meal.", "If I am going to have carbs this would not be a choice. Very bland on its own. I made it with olive oil,garlic,and parm regg cheese. Nothing special. Then I made it with my red sauce and all I could taste was my sauce. I usually like Barilla products.", "This three cheese tortellini from Barilla is super-easy to make.  Just bring water to a boil and dump in the dried pasta; ten minutes later, the pasta is ready.  The taste is decent enough--it's very light on the cheese flavor.  It's not as good as fresh or even refrigerated tortellini, but is good for a dry pasta.  For me, the convenience factor makes up for the fact that it isn't quite as flavorful.  One downside is that they kind of clumped together after I drained the water and when I tried to separate them using a fork, a few fell apart.  As for serving size, the front of the package says serves four, but the nutrition facts says six.  I found that if it was a light meal, four people was the serving size.", "Does this dried tortellini compare with fresh or even frozen?  No, of course not, how could it?But for what it is, its a lightning quick meal that was very pleasing to my wife and me.All we did was boil the noodles the recommended amount, combine with a can of garlic cheese marinara sauce and dinner is served!  The whole thing took 15 minutes from package to plate.  And you get plenty too!  We didn't even eat half of it, so I'm sure a family of four would be very satisfied.It tastes good for what it is, the cheese flavor could be a little stronger, but again, its not gonna compare with fresh tortellini.Overall, this is a good tasting, super fast, low cost dish.  Nothing to complain about there.", "This product takes little preparation.  Just bring it to a boil and cook for about ten minutes, drain and serve.  It is bland and needs some additional ingredients to make it more tasty.  Marinara sauce and grated parmesan cheese are just the thing to make it taste better.  The package says it will feed four but those would be rather small servings.", "If you like tortellini, this stuff is GOOD! It's fairly easy to prepare and the package also gives suggestions on various ways you could serve it.  One suggestion I would like to give to the company that makes it.....have the package resealable.  Not everyone needs family-sized portions.", "I have made Barilla's tortellini a number of times over the years, my family loves it!  I actually like it more now, they have improved the filling so that it cooks up smooth inside (it used to have dry flaky spots inside when I first started using it years ago.).I have made pasta dishes, pasta salad, soups, and even cooked it in my slow cooker, all with delicious results.  I am guaranteed clean plates from my kids when I use this, even if I include the ever-feared broccoli!My one and only frustration with this product is that there is no whole wheat/grain option.  Because this pasta is white, I do not make it as often as I would if I could choose whole grains for better nutrition.  Please, Barilla, consider making tortellini part of your Plus lineup!", "Very happy with Barilla Three Cheese Tortellini. Easy to prepare and on the table quickly. A good change from regular pasta. The first time I made it as a side dish with chicken. You don't need the whole bag for 2 people. I made that mistake. 12 oz. is a lot of tortellini.Was just as good at lunch the next day with a little butter and garlic. Already placed an order for more.", "This review is uncharacteristically brief for me. Most of my reviews run to about 500 words or so, plus or minus 50. This one is far shorter. It's not that I didn't like the Barilla Tortellini that I got through the Amazon Vine program. I liked it a lot. Rather, it's just that I can't come up with 500 meaningful words to write about a basic pasta product.What can I say? The tortellini cook up nicely in about 10 minutes or so in a pot of boiling water, just as the package directions say. Even without adding olive oil to the water, they don't stick together at all. Drain them in a colander, spoon some onto a plate and enjoy a quick, simple and tasty lunch or light dinner portion. You can top them with your favorite type of marinara sauce, and/or sprinkle on some grated aged Parmigiano-Reggiano (use the real thing, NOT the horrible stuff in the green shaker can). I spiced mine up with a generous dash of Penzey's Italian Herbs, lots of freshly ground black pepper and finely chopped Serrano chilis. Taste is highly subjective, of course, but to me the Barilla Tortellini were fine, with a good filling-to-dough ratio, a pleasant texture and a complex flavor hinting at the three varieties of cheese they contain.Our usual go-to tortellini isLa Piana, from Italy, mainly because it's readily available and cheap at our local World Market. Barilla is a very acceptable substitute, and I wouldn't hesitate to stock up on whichever brand is cheaper. In my opinion, price is the only discriminant between them."], "Gamma": [0.07862935960292816, 0.07932459563016891, 0.08061881363391876, 0.07746347039937973, 0.07298398017883301, 0.07375726848840714,
