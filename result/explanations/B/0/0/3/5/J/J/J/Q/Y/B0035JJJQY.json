Once the software is loaded, the unit basically plugs in and downloads.  So far it is also pretty tough, and maintains a decent battery life (a charge is good for around 8 hours of play back).  Still its two biggest features (at least as far as I am concerned) are its bearable price point, and the fact that it's Audible enabled.  However, the radio feature did not work for me at all.  And expect to replace the earbuds because mine fell apart within a week.", "What I like about this device is that it doesn't try to do too much. It focuses on audio and does that reasonably well.What works?- pleasant sound- stellar battery life- adequate display size and clarity- support for a fairly broad range of audio formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, etc.)- very compact unit and well constructed ... it should take reasonable abuse even as a workout device.- intuitive operation ... it's easy to get started with using it.- decent feature set ... audio player and FM radio work well.What doesn't work?- the display resolution is not quite sufficient for video or photographs.- I couldn't get used to the accompanying SongBird software.In conclusion, this is a reasonable option for an audio device.I'd heartily recommend it over the Philips GoGear Cam, which tries to do too much and falls flat.Happy Listening!", "\"The Philips GoGear Vibe is a no frills MP3 player with finicky software.  The player itself works fine, and if you're comfortable dragging and dropping your files onto the player, then you should be fine.In design and construction the GoGear is surprisingly nice for a player of this caliber.  The rear of the player is made of metal and the buttons have a nice tactile feel.  On the front is a set of directional buttons to skip between items and navigate the menus, with a play/pause button in the center.  There are also back and menu buttons on the front of the player.  The bottom has the sliding power/control lock button and the USB and headphone jack.  On top of the player are the volume controls.  Construction quality is high and the player feels nice in the hand.  The included headphones are nothing special, and are similar to what you'd get with an iPod.  Also, included is a short USB cable to charge and sync it.  The only part of the GoGear that belies its value pricing is the low-resolution screen.  It works fine, but if you've ever used an iPhone4 you'll be staring at the pixels on the GoGear's screen.The GoGear has a lot of built in functionality.  In addition to music it can display photos and videos, but that is of limited and value with the 1.5\"\" screen.  The other features, the FM radio and built in voice recorder, are of more value.Using the player is very straightforward and the menus and setting are easy to figure out.  You can create up to three playlists on the fly.  There are a couple of sound options to enhance the music (such as Full Sound which deepens the bass and creates a surround impression), and even a custom equalizer option.  A nice feature is that when you lock the controls the volume buttons still function.  Sound quality is good.  I didn't notice any difference between the GoGear and my iPhone4 when using the included headphones on both.  With Full Sound on the music is rich and detailed.  Unless you're a serious audiophile I doubt you'll be disappointed.So far, so good, but the included Song Bird software is seriously frustrating.  I installed it on a machine running Windows 7 Professional and it said it was not designed for this operating system and some features may be disabled.  Thus, when it prompted me to choose the types of files I'd like the player to be able to play, it wouldn't let me select anything, so I just closed out that screen.  The software itself looks a lot like an older version of iTunes, but it's not nearly as intuitive.  My preferred method for getting songs onto the GoGear was to just drag and drop them into the music folder on the GoGear's directory instead.  I lost album artwork that way though.  Lastly, I'd like to mention that the drag and drop method works on a Mac as well.Battery life is exceptional, not only playback time, but also standby time.All in all...if you don't mind dragging and dropping and want a simple, value-priced MP3 player the Philips is a good way to go.P.S.: Feel free to leave a comment if you have a question and I'll do my best to answer it.\"", "\"The GoGear Vibe is a decent MP3 player.  Obviously it is not going to push the iPod out of the market, but it does have a place.  If you do not want to have to use iTunes to manage (sometimes mismanage) your music, the Vibe offers the straight forward approach of being able to simply drag and drop music files onto the device.It does come with software by Phillips named Songbird, but to me that defeats the point of this player, which is to provide good quality listening without the fuss and muss of the iTunes experience.  Songbird installs OK but it is not overly user-friendly.  You need an internet connection to install Songbird.  The installation prompt is on the Vibe but it downloads the installer from Philips' website.  It installed OK for me on Windows 7 and XP (SP3).As for the Vibe itself:The device ships with earbuds and a USB cable to charge the Vibe and transfer files, as well as a Quick Start guide.  The device has a User Manual and FAQ loaded on it. It is packaged in a molded plastic package.  I tend to find these annoying, as you have to try and cut it open somewhere, while avoiding hitting any of the package contents.  It wasn't the worst package of this type I've handled, but it was still annoying.The device is simple to charge.  Simply plug it in with the USB cable.  It takes an hour or two its first time out to charge.  The controls are intuitive for anyone who has used a joystick/iPod type device before.The player's 8GB of space provide enough storage to keep a decent size music library, as well as any photos or small videos if you like.  The Vibe is very small, at about 2.5\"\" x 1.7\"\" and less than \"\" thick.  The color display is 1.5\"\".  Like any other LCD device it can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.  The case is metal and feels pretty solid.Sound quality of the device is excellent.  I own three different iPod models, various earbud/phones, and some high end speaker units, and I have to say, the reproduction of detail and clarity on the Vibe is incredible, especially at this price point.  The included earbuds are not that good.  They are the old style which have a fixed size ear piece rather than various size ear adapters.  This means you can never quite get the earbuds in your ear, which is when you can appreciate the fullness of the sound.  But when you position the earbuds right, you can hear that the Vibe has awesome sound.  Bottom line: if you buy the Vibe, factor in the need to immediately use earbuds other than the included pair.  To me, I find that no different than I do for an iPod, where Apple also ships mediocre earbuds.By the way, the Vibe also includes a built in FM radio.  The quality is decent, depending of course on the signal quality where you are located.As far as other features, battery life is excellent and you can play music for a long time on one charge.  Phillips advertises 24 hours of audio playback, and I've gotten a bit more than that on a singe charge.  The vibe also includes a built in microphone so you can record in MP3 format.  The mic quality is average for this type of device, as in it'll record voices, etc. but don't expect hi-def playback.All in all, I think this is an excellent quality music player.  The sound is just as good as the iPod, in fact I find it better, and I don't have to use iTunes. Which to me is a huge plus.\"", "For me, it's (mostly)all about the sound. And the Philips unit, while not, perhaps, as good as the Sansa Clip+ (which is generally accepted as one of the better sounding units on the market), is excellent.However - to get that good sound, you'll have to ditch the included earbuds, which are lousy. Of course, most included earbuds are not what I'd use, so that's not such a big deal. I swapped them out for a series of buds I have in varying qualities, and I have to say I'm impressed.The problems crop up once you do anything but listen to music. The display is poor - low resolution makes album art or photo viewing an exercise in frustration. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. The navigation, however, is fine.The included Songbird software is simply not to my liking, which isn't a big deal at all - or so I though. The problem is that without installing it, not only can you not install firmware updates to the player, you can't even see if they're available. Nowhere was I able to find out what the correct, current firmware version is - and I think that's rotten. I don't want Songbird, but I should be able to update my player.Bottom line: if you're looking for a simple and inexpensive 8GB audio player, it's not a terrible choice - but I honestly don't see where it fits in the market. For less money you can pick up a Clip+ that has a memory card (or Slot Radio) slot. Since the display on this isn't worth anything to me, I'd personally go for the smaller, better sounding, and more flexible Clip+.If I really wanted a nice screen, I'd just up the funds and go for a Sony or one of the other Sansas. And both the Sansas and Sonys have better warranties.So, good for what it is (and I forgot to mention it appears to be built well, with a metal body), but I just don't really have much of a use for what it is, with better choices on either sides of its price point.", "Philips GoGear Vibe 8 GB MP3 Player is a reasonably priced MP3 player from Philips Electronics. Small and with a good deal of memory, this MP3 player offers enough of the basic features to satisfy casual MP3 users' needs.Let's talk about the good points first. This MP3 player is a good value and it has a long battery life. A full charge can last the better part of a day so it is ready when you need it. The compact size and durable construction are also plusses with this MP3 player. It takes up very little space and the metal construction is made to last. I like the menu navigation as well and found it very intuitive.Most important to an MP3 player is sound quality and in this area, my feelings are mixed. My MP3 player experience is limited, so I have little to which I can compare. But based on other MP3 players, the sound quality with this Phillips device is a little below average. I was also very disappointed with the Full Sound option. This is supposed to improve the sound quality, but I could barely tell any difference. It has a little too much bass for my tastes, but others might find it acceptable.Probably my greatest complaint with this Philips MP3 player is the included ear buds. They are the type that hugs the ear, but they do not contain a foam cushion and thus are not very comfortable or very good at blocking outside noise. The good thing, of course, is that an accessory like this can be replaced, which I recommend doing if you purchase this product.MP3 players are nice and Philips GoGear Vibe 8 GB MP3 Player is a good MP3 player, especially for the price. There are certainly better MP3 players out there, but this is a good one for beginners or those with basic needs. I'm torn with my overall rating because of the division between the pros and cons. So, I will award this device with a middle rating of three stars and a modest recommendation.", "I also own the Philips GoGear 8 gb camera/MP3 player.  While it does more than this unit, it also has a cheaper feel to it.The setup and sound quality of this device are fine.  Battery life is good.  Build quality is above average.I didn't much care for the supplied ear buds, which I thought were of poor quality.  Product interface is not bad.  Songbird (Philip's proprietary software is poor, in my opinion).Still, it's not a bad product nor is it especially good.  I'd rate it somewhere between 3 & 4 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.", "I didn't use the GoGear Vibe with Songbird, as I have a Mac it was easier to load mp3 and jpg files directly to the unit instead of bothering to learn a new software or boot up the Windows machine. While other reviewers have had durability problems with the GoGear I've been using it for about a month without any problems. The battery life is decent, the size is nice. I wouldn't feel comfortable tossing this in my jeans pocket like I do an iPod, the case doesn't feel durable enough for that. I think sitting on the unit would kill it. Primarily I'm using it as an mp3 player for the car. Plugged into the car's sound system the Vibe delivers an acceptable sound quality and is easy to conceal. The control system isn't intuitive, but once learned is easy to remember. I like the ability to limit the volume output, for when I loan it to the kids. It's an upgrade from theSanDisk Sansa Shaker 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue)they've been using. The quick start guide is useless - read the pdf manual preinstalled on the unit. Overall, there's nothing exciting about this mp3 player but as a basic unit to use in the car it gets the job done. I think if you're choosing between this and anApple iPod shuffle 2 GB Silver (4th Generation) NEWEST MODELthe ability to choose songs visually, via the screen, might be an advantage, but it doesn't offer more than theApple iPod nano 8 GB Graphite (6th Generation) NEWEST MODEL. On the other hand, it's a lot cheaper. I will update my review when (if) the unit fails. It seems to have been an issue for several owners.", "\"The very first portable MP3 players were introduced in 1998 but didn't really catch on en masse until Apple released the iPod in late 2001.  Apple chose to use their own audio compression (AAC), which had better sound quality than MP3.  Apple's iPods are ubiquitous now with portable music players but believe it or not, there are other music players that offer features equal to those of or better than the iPod.  Philips offers the GoGear ViBE as an alternative to the iPod nano by appealing to one very important consideration: value.PROS:- Very good value- Good user interface- Good sound quality- Good battery life- Supports MP3, WMA, and FLAC formats- Firmware upgradeable- Decent FM receptionCONS:- FullSound \"\"feature\"\" is a gimmick- Songbird application is weak- Cannot update firmware without Songbird- Terrible 90-day warranty- Earbuds are awfulBack in 1998, I bought the Diamond Rio PMP300, which is often incorrectly credited with being the first MP3 player ever made (it was the 2nd), for about $200.  It only had 32MB of space and used a parallel port cable to transfer music.  I had been using l3enc, a command line encoder, a few years earlier to compress my CDs and listen to them on my PC.  Having a portable was a godsend.  Fast forward 12 years and wowie zowie!  I myself have never owned an Apple iPod.  I never found it to do anything much better than the plethora of other music players available and was typically far more expensive while relying on proprietary cables.  The Philips GoGear ViBE is one of those other players that does just about everything an iPod can do at an MSRP Steve Jobs would fire an Apple employee for even suggesting.SOUND QUALITYI personally found the sound quality of the GoGear ViBE to be very good.  Its signal-to-noise ratio is very good compared to that of other high quality music players.  I did an A-B comparison with aSanDisk Sansa CLIP+ player.  The CLIP+ is considered by many audiophiles to have one of the best audio chips in a portable music player so it made an ideal measuring stick for the ViBE.  I used several FLAC files as well as Lame VBR extreme files for my comparison.  I also used anEtymotic hf5audiophile earphone and tossed the terrible included earbuds.  I have to honestly say that the differences were very subtle.  While I personally still preferred the SanDisk's sound quality overall, the Philips GoGear was no slouch.  However, the FullSound feature really is a gimmick.  It's essentially just another EQ preset to me and it really boosted the lows but caused undesirable distortion in the mids and highs.  You are better off using the included 5 band equalizer and setting your own custom setting or leaving it flat, which is my preference.  If lazy, you can also select one of several presets available as well.  I also really liked the volume limit feature because it will help me keep it at safe level for my kids when they use it.USABILITY/SCREENI found the interface of the ViBE to be very easy to use and the sceen was easy to read.  The navigation controls are on the front of the player.  It simulates a typical d-pad style layout though the directional buttons took a few tries to get used to.  Additionally, there are two buttons just below the screen.  One of those buttons is a return button while the other provides options depending on which feature of the player you are currently using.  The volume up/down buttons are on the top of the player and aren't as easy to press.  I probably would've preferred a volume dial at that location.  There are no buttons on either side of the player.  The bottom of the player has the USB and headphone ports along with the power/lock switch and mic.  I found no issues with the headphone port as reported by another reviewer.  My earphones and the included earbuds plugged in firmly and stayed in.  Twisting the connector around in the jack did not cause any static whatsoever.  The 1.5\"\" screen is easy to read and you have 3 color-based theme choices.  Though the demo video and photos looked pretty nice and could double as a photo/video viewer in a pinch, it is really too small for regular use and more trouble than it's worth, especially for video.  One thing I didn't like too much about the screen was how it uses album art as the background while playing songs.  Some album art didn't make great backgrounds because it sometimes made the text (song title, album, artist, time, etc.) difficult to read.FM TUNERI rarely have had good luck with FM tuners that were built-in to my devices so I was pleasantly surprised when the GoGear ViBE actually got good reception.  It pulled in stations better than my SanDisk Sansa CLIP+.  It also supports RDS, which can display information like the station ID, song title, and artists.  You're allowed 20 presets and the autotune feature worked pretty well and it scanned all the frequencies before selecting the 20 strongest.CHARGING/BATTERY LIFEThe battery life indicator was at 2 out of 4 bars when I first turned it on.  I plugged it into my PC using the 6 inch or so mini-USB cable and it took another couple of hours to reach a full charge.  I actually preferred the small USB cable because I happen to have a box full of longer mini-USB cables from a variety of other devices I own including digital cameras and Blackberries.  Unfortunately, you are limited to charging only via a powered USB port from a computer as no AC adapter is included.  This could be a problem if you decide to travel with the GoGear ViBE without a laptop but there are a lot of universal USB chargers available these days.  I myself can just take my old Blackberry charger along, should the need arise.  The rated battery life is 24 hours of audio but that is probably with all the battery saving features set at aggressive levels.  It's also likely that certain audio codecs like FLAC will also drain more power.  If I can get 75% of the rated life (18hrs) then I'll be very happy.  One neat battery save feature is to have the screen shut off after a period of time but you can choose to display the date and time.  I've only seen this work with the music player.  In FM mode, the screen just blanks out.AUDIOBOOKI'm not an experienced audiobook listener, but decided to getDan Brown's The Lost Symbolsince I hadn't gotten to reading the physical book.  After ripping the discs, I loaded them onto the GoGear ViBE and Dan Brown showed up as an artist and The Lost Symbol as an album.  I selected play all and it began playing the files in order.  I paused the audio and turned the player off and turned it back on to find that the player had remembered the point I had paused it.  I may have found myself a new way of catching up on my reading :)SOFTWARE/FIRMWAREThe GoGear ViBE comes with a custom copy of Songbird.  I tried to install it on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit computer and it gave me an error message that some features may not work correctly in my version of Windows.  Come on Philips.  There is no reason not to have full 32-bit and 64-bit support.  It installed fine however, and I was able to add my music to the player and use it to transfer music to the GoGear ViBE.  Firmware updates are performed from within the customized version of Songbird as well.  I downloaded a more current version of Songbird but the non-customized version did not have the option for updating the firmware and there is no way I know of to update it without using the included version.  Boo Philips!  The firmware version on my player was v1.33 and when I checked for updates, was told that was the most current.  I don't care for Songbird so I chose to use Winamp.  The only problem with using Winamp was that it copied the music into the root directory of the player rather than straight into the \"\"Music\"\" folder.CONCLUSIONThe Philips GoGear ViBE 8GB MP3 Player is a very good player with lots of good and useful features.  I found the sound quality to be good and the player very easy to use.  It's unfortunate that Philips only provides an anemic 90-day warranty, but at least the build quality appears solid.  It is a good value.  If you don't need the large screen for viewing album art, photos and video, I highly recommend the SanDisk Sansa CLIP+ instead because of better overall sound, smaller size, and expansion capabilities.  The GoGear ViBE is not the cheapest 8GB MP3 player you can buy, but it certainly offers a very appealing feature set for the money and I have no qualms about recommending it.\"", "\"I absolutely love this thing, in case you didn't get that from the title. lolThe *flexibility* and functionality of this device is amazing. You can plug this on your PC as either a USB mass storage device or a portable media player (there is a setting in the options that allows you to switch between the two). The former allows you to access the MP3 player as a standard flash drive and drag and drop your songs without using any software. The latter, on the other hand, allows you to use the device like the inferior iPod (where you need to use a media organizer like Windows Media Player synchronize music). Personally I prefer the former, but it's good that you have a choice. Buttons are easy to press and placed in a logical layout.Additionally, you can use the player to listen to music WHILE it's charging (when connected to a PC it asks you whether you want to \"\"Charge and Listen\"\" or \"\"Charge and Transfer media\"\"). Of course unlike the iPod, it comes with a standard mini-USB plug. Any standard mini-USB cable will work. No need to buy overpriced proprietary accessories.Another nice thing about the system software is that it allows you to browse your music by using the directory view. Perfect if you have your music organized in folders on your PC. All you gotta do is drag and drop your whole My Music folder to your player, and find your songs just as you would on your PC. Of course you can customize your own playlists if you want.I read some complaints about audio quality. Personally I think the audio quality is perfect. However, you MUST turn off Fullsound in the audio settings (as it's enabled by default). With FullSound on audio was muffled and bass was too high. With FullSound off voices are clear and bass is at a normal level. Also, I don't use any of the equalizer settings. With both FullSound and Equalizers off I can't tell a difference between this and my other portable audio players. Definitely no complaints in the audio department. Loud, clear, and noise free. And again, if you like deep bass, you can have it.I just love this kind of flexibility. Highly recommended IMO. This one is much, MUCH better than the horrible iPod Shuffle.\"", "\"Chances are, if you're looking for something like an mp3 player and didn't already jump on the Apple/iWhatever bandwagon, you're comparing some lesser known mp3 players.  My intent here is to not fully describe everything that this Philips GoGear Vibe can do, but to compare it to the competition.  Hint:  it's not as good.First, let's start with ripping it out of the box.  It comes with a dead battery, but no big deal - plug it in and charge it up!  And a couple hours later..?  The battery is charged, I unplug it from the USB cable, and the thing is completely frozen.  Jamming the tip of a pocketknife blade into the \"\"reset\"\" button at the bottom resolved it...yay, but not a good first impression.  I suppose that explains why the reset button is so prominent.Sure, that was just a fluke.  But the design of the actual thing, which is probably one of the biggest differences between it and all the other mp3 player competitions...is bad.  On the bottom of the device, you get a On/Off/Hold switch, conveniently located right NEXT to where the headphone plugs in, so if you want to use that switch, you have to navigate around the headphones.  Nearby is the mic...and the reset button...and the USB plug.The case, while is stated as \"\"sleek aluminum,\"\" feels like plastic.  Looks like it, too.On the TOP of the device are two more buttons, these used for volume control.  Why they needed those buttons at all is beyond me, since the \"\"up\"\" and \"\"down\"\" buttons on the front of the device don't do anything when music is playing - seems to have a couple extra buttons.  There's also a little round dot on the top that looks like it might have been put there to do something, but I think they just plugged it up with more plastic.  The horrendous instructions, which don't actually contain WORDS, foreign or otherwise, are completely and utterly useless.And while I see on the product description something called \"\"folder view,\"\" I haven't been able to find it.  I can play my music by genre, artist, album, and playlist, but not by folder, which is a huge deal-breaker for me.  I don't want to make sure all my mp3's metadata is in synch with how I store them.Sound quality, once you throw away the headphones that the device comes with is average.  Sansa does much better in the audio quality category.  And while I'm on the topic of Sansa - instead of buying this Philips mp3s player, I'd recommend buying theSanDisk Sansa Fuze 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black).  (It comes in 4GB and 8GB, and also can accept a micro SD card for more storage, and doesn't suffer from the above issues.)Overall, an average mp3 player with below-average ergonomic design.  The screen quality is nice and responsive, while the sound quality, menu navigation, and pretty much everything is a whimpering \"\"ehhh.\"\"  Yes, mp3 players are commodities now, but this company decided to slap their name on one without offering anything new, special, or better than the competition.\"", "The sound is excellent.  It is a sleek and small MP3.  It was hard to read the instruction booklet as it was not printed well, but after figuring it out, it works quite well.  It also came with multiple adapters.  It recharges quickly too.  This is a nice product.", "There are a lot of mp3 players out there now, and they all play mp3s. So does this one.The relevant questions that manufacturers should be considering are:1) Battery life. This is the number one issue. Storage is cheap, especially toward the lower end, like this product. I don't need a 16 gb player with a 4 hour battery life. I'd rather have an 8 gb one with a 16 hour battery life. This is an 8 gb with something in the range of a 6 hour battery life. I am not impressed, but it can get the job done.2) Interface. This is a fail at this mark. The interface is harder to use than most of the products that I've used. This is especially true physically, as the headphone jack is on the BOTTOM of the unit. Unless you're hanging this around your neck...what were they thinking??? Also, it tends to lock up a bit when I finish charging. Not cool.3) Software. As these become cheaper, this becomes more important. But I don't want a million bells and whistles. If possible, I'd rather have NO software at all and not have to have a special program to install songs on my mp3 player. If it could interact with Windows Media Player or iTunes, that would be ideal. But to have a crappy program that takes up hundreds of megabytes on my computer? That just makes me angry.In brief, I'd never give this as a gift. If you're on a tight budget, and need something low-end and cheap, this might work for you. Otherwise, I'd look into something else. Really suboptimal in several crucial ways. (Seriously??? Headphone jack on the bottom of the unit??? Epic engineer fail! Facepalm!)", "*** SOFTWARESongbird is Philips' version of iTunes, it asks if you want to update Songbird, import your iTunes songs, and update the firmware on the GoGear Vibe.The motivation is good, but the execution is lousy...the supplied songbird softare is a total disaster, period. They should have provided another way of creating playlist instead of using the songbird.I am not using the songbird software. It's easier to navigate between folders with window explorer. However, without using songbird, I won't be able to install firmware updates to the player....actually, I can not even see if new firmware is available.This is the key reason I rate this product 3 stars.*** BUILDIt appears to be built well, with a metal body.*** MENUThe provided quick start instructions were not useful.

Fitted with a 1.5\"\" color LCD screen, this 8GB player also offers up 20 preset FM stations with RDS. It also allows for downloads of digital books via Audible.com software. After almost three weeks of continuous use, these are my thoughts about this product.After downloading the very proprietary Phillips Songbird Windows based software and getting error messages,  I was finally able to charge the unit via USB cable to my pc.  Once the software worked, getting updates was easy. FYI: Firmware updates cannot be downloaded without Songbird. Acceptable formats include, MP3, WAV, WMA, FLAC, and APE. The volume controls are standard stuff with the exception of the customizable volume limit. Not bad. The Super Scroll feature was okay. The keypad lock was iffy. On a full charge, battery life was good up to about 18 hours.The customizable equalizer isn't all that. The sound enhancement feature is non existent. Its a given that the included headset is nothing more than a throw away. After plugging in my Klipsch, the overall quality of sound wasn't that bad. Smart Shuffle is okay. Music playback alone gets 4 Stars. The guys in the factory actually did a good job with the equalizer presets. Surprisingly the majority of my FM stations came in better then expected. Five were actually crystal clear.I didn't try Audiobooks. The built in microphone and voice recording features were not that bad. The grocery list didn't miss a beat. Video playback (MJPEG) was extremely slow. For me, its not exactly something I would go to anyway. Like everyone else in the player business, Phillips doesn't put a lot into the packaging. Owners get a USB cable, a cheesy head set, and a quick start guide. Warranty wise, the company only backs this product with a bare bones 90 day guarantee.For price conscious shoppers, the Phillips Vibe 8GB Mp3 Player may fill the void. The sound quality is not that bad. Storage wise, we're talking about 1800 songs. Overall battery life is rather good too. The LCD screen offers average display. The only negatives I have with this product is the on and off again proprietary software, restrictive firmware, the cheesy headset, and the lousy 90 day warranty. Those hits alone keeps this Mp3 player from gaining more then 3 stars.\"", "\"The Philips GoGear Vibe is not setting out to compete with Apple's MP3 syndicate.  The GoGear Vibe is priced below even a current 2gb iPod Shuffle and is made from cheaper components than what Apple uses.  However, the GoGear shines where it matters the most - performance.The GoGear Vibe produces decent sound as much as most MP3 players out there, decent enough to warrant an upgrade from the included earbuds.  You'll only be let down if you are listening with some audiophile $100+ pair of headphones.  This little beauty can pump out some serious volume too, more than the iPods I've had.  The screen feels like cheap plastic, but it looks pretty good, being high enough resolution to give lifelike picture quality, but definitely short of a retinal display.The aesthetics of the unit are fine, the shell is slate colored, brushed metal.  The button on the front feels cheap, but looks fine.  The screen is a cheap plastic but looks nice and glossy.  The size is just a tad bigger than I'd want given the tiny 1.5\"\" screen, but it is light and small enough for any practical use.Feature-wise, the drag and drop folder arrangement makes it easy to plug the GoGear Vibe into your usb port, transfer some files and get going.  I elected not to bother with the included software you are prompted to install.  There are a ton of supported audio file types including .flac.  Yet, many of the videos I tried were not supported - mostly .avi  I also was not able to play .flac audio through the USB input on my car, though the mp3's all worked.  This is due to some copyright anti-piracy red tape.Overall, I really liked the Philips GoGear Vibe and would recommend it to anyone looking for an MP3 player that has the functionality of a higher end player, but not the price.  The 2.5\"\" screen 16gb capacity GoGear Aria might be a better choice for those looking to get the most out of their video collection.\"", "The GoGear is a nicely sized MP3 player. It comes with standard earbuds that have the wide earpiece (not in-ear-canal buds) and has a video screen capability. It is equivalent to the Sansa Fuze, a tad smaller and similar in price. But it has a fatal flaw, hence the 2 star review.The Fuze need not worry about the GoGear, however. The GoGear has a nice deep bass sound but it's very flat and lacking in depth. I used the same headphones (Klipsch) and the GoGear had heavier bass but less depth and richness of sound.The video screen is bright, a bit smaller, I think, than the Fuze but very pretty. It is the nicest feature of the GoGear. You can really watch a show on this tiny 1.5 x 1.5 inch screen.The controls consist of an up-down-left-right rocker with a start-pause button in the middle, a small on-off button underneath (a sliding toggle) and 2 volume buttons (up down) on top. The controls are small and not easy to remember compared to the Fuze (rocker wheel and on-off on the side) but the Fuze's on off-sliding toggle is a bit hard to manipulate and I wore off the small raised blip that allows your fingernail to grab and push it. In this respect, the GoGear is better.The included earphones are useless to people with smaller ears; I couldn't even get them on, and they come with hard rubber coating, not foam. Not comfy. You'll need real earbuds.NOW-- Here's the worst thing, the killer. The plug of the headphones doesn't fit flush into the headphone socket. The plug of not one but three headsets that I tried failed to fit the socket, leaving about a 1/8th inch of plug not inserted into the player. In addition, the plug is loose, and if you jostle it, the connection is lost--no sound. You've GOT to be kidding me?! The manufacturer couldn't tell this is the wrong size for a standard mini-plug???? I tried the headset that CAME with the unit, and it's the same thing, as mini-plugs are a standard size. Oh boy oh boy. That's a big NO. This unit should never have seen the light of day.", "This is definitely not the best MP3 player in this price range.  There are a few flaws that cause this player to be a poor choice.1. The earbuds are horrible.  Unless you already have a better pair of earbuds, there is no reason to purchase this product because you'll find yourself wanting better earbuds.  The sound is too flat.2. After you fast forward through ANY video, including those pre-installed on the player for tutorials and samples, the sound crackles terribly.  And once the crackling begins, the only way to get rid of it is to rewind slightly (which doesn't always fix the problem) or to restart the video entirely.3. The fonts and graphics are all sort of primitive looking.  I feel like I am using a player based on the Commodore 64 OS.4. The Phillips Songbird software (think iTunes) is ok, especially because it is a LOT faster than iTunes is, but you cannot adjust the equalizer on a per song basis.  So if you've spent time adjusting the volume and equalizer settings on your favorite music in iTunes, that data is useless when you import your iTunes library.  Granted, this is a limitation of the Songbird software on the PC and doesn't have much to do with the player itself... but it just adds to the disappointment.It should be noted that I updated to the latest firmware on the player and all of these problems still exist, even though the release notes state that performance was improved.I cannot recommend this product.", "\"Recently, in the midst of the mid-summer doldrums, I decided to \"\"live a little,\"\" as the saying goes. Even though the GoGear Vibe does not officially support Mac OS X, I threw all caution to the wind and ordered one up. So how did my impulsive and gutsy move work out?Well, it *is* possible to drag-copy MP3 and .jpg files to the Vibe, using the Finder, when the Vibe is connected to a USB port using the supplied cable. The Vibe shows up on the Mac desktop as a USB drive. AAC music files (the format used by the iTunes Store), unfortunately, do not play on the Vibe. I also was not able to get any of my video files to play. The screen is so small, though, that I don't really care.The Vibe isn't a bad media player. It has acceptable sound quality and the user interface is reasonably intuitive. There are a couple of significant design flaws: the headphone jack and the volume control buttons are located on opposite ends of the device and there isn't any visual indication of progress or time remaining when the Vibe is charging. Both of these flaws detract from the overall usability.I think the Vibe is best suited for people who want an inexpensive media player for, say, their children or to use in situations where one might not want to carry a valuable device. I use mine when I go to baseball games on public transit--I can listen to music on the way to and from the ballpark and listen to the play-by-play on the radio during the game. For daily use, however, I prefer another player I own that has a better physical design and a more convenient interface.Bottom line: three stars, due to the two design flaws discussed above.\"", "This a standard mp3 player. nothing special just standard plug in and then drag and drop your files. I wanted to get this as a backup mp3 player for my runs and it serves well as this purpose. i have a touch screen ipod nano, so i used that as a comparison when using this player, and this is what i found:pros:-really easy to use, you don't have to look at any manuals to know how it works-good battery lifecons:-the screen pixel image quality is worse than my first cell phone in 1999-the sound quality, while using the same headphones that i use on the nano, was lower and sounded muffled-the fm radio was crackly and not clear compared to the nano in the same areaconclusion:this is a good no-frills mp3 player. holds a lot of gigs for the price, and i would pretty happy with it if i didn't have a nano to compare it to. (I got the nano as a gift right after i got this player) Bottom line: just due to price, i would get this over a nano, but if you want solid features, get a nano.", "\"Please read the top-rated reviews of this item by \"\"techdad review\"\" and  by \"\"Gattech.\"\" Those reviews hit the high points of this current generation Vibe. I just wanted to note that the Vibe lacks a couple of important features that a competitor, the Sansa Clip+, offers - the ability to take an expansion memory card (the easy to find microSD cards used in cellphones and cameras), and the ability to use a very high quality compression codec, OGG Vorbis.I own the last generation Vibe (which Gattech says sounds better than this newer one) and just bought a Clip+. Since the new Clip+ I bought is noted for exceptional sound quality at ANY portable price level, and supports OGG Vorbis, I decided to take a gamble and re-encode my CD collection in OGG Vorbis instead of using my lossless (WMA Lossless) files (neither player, the Vibe or the Clip+, support WMA Lossless or Apple Lossless, only the open source FLAC - not that this is a bad thing, and since my files were lossless, converting them wasn't the no-no it is with compressed files - although I chose to re-rip).I discovered that the combination of the Clip+, decent earphones (Klipsch S2's), and Ogg Vorbis resulted in a terrific listening experience - close to CD quality - and my 45 gb of lossless files (approximately 100 gb of CD's) were only 7.2 gb of Vorbis compressed files at the \"\"CD quality\"\" setting in the Rhythm Box music player I used to rip them (160kbps, 5 on a scale of 1-10 in Ogg Vorbis). Definitely better than the old Vibe with 128 kbps WMA encoded files, close to lossless quality, and significantly reduced compressed file size.So to summarize - both the Vibe and Clip+ support lossless FLAC, but only the Clip+ supports OGG Vorbis much higher quality compressed files. I was worried I would have to trade quality for portability (file size) but OGG Vorbis really helped me out.Here is the Clip+ Amazon product link:SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)I recommend the Clip+ in the 2gb edition with at least an 8gb microSD card, which will set you back under thirteen dollars at my time of purchase:Kingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4/8GBThe reason for this is that I just drag my Music folder from the computer directly onto the external memory card housed in its adapter, not plugged into the Clip+. This is the simplest, cleanest way to load music files. Then I pop the 8gb microSD chip into the Clip+ and the Clip+ integrates the music files into its filing system. The 2gb reserved in the Clip+ is actually only 1.5 gb after accounting for Clip+'s internal requirements and uses. I let the Clip+ keep that space for recording voice memos and FM broadcasts and storing audiobooks if I ever get any. Of course if you have a larger music collection to carry around, get the 8gb edition and a larger microSD card! That's the beauty of having three units to choose from (2-4-8gb) plus a memory slot.If the Clip+ gets damaged, or it's battery finally dies, I can just move the memory card to another one. Or into a different device.I had to sing some of these praises of the Clip+ instead of criticizing the Vibe for lacking these features, because the Vibe looks a lot better and has a real video screen. For some users those are the most important points! But if you love the best quality music, also check out the Clip+!\"", "This is an 8 gig of solid state mp3 player, plenty enough if you just have a casual music collection. A bulk compared to other players.  Once you plug it to your PC, it will ask you to load its own Songbird software.  I like to organize my music in playlists so I chose to install the program.  It surprised me that it has the capability to import all my Itunes playlists.  The software is also a more simplistic version of Itunes although less powerful and has less features.  The very first time I played it (with just 1 folder of songs), it stopped in the middle of a song. I pressed all the buttons including reset but completely unresponsive.  I plugged it back via USB and it starts again.  When I loaded all my playlists, which filled up 90% of the memory, all hell broke loose.As a summary of my experience with this player, see the pros and cons below:Whats in the box:MP3 player, earphones, short USB cable.Pros:- Sturdy construction, solidly clad in aluminum.- I did not find the plug on the supplied earphone as a problem - snug fit. If it was, it is now fixed.- Sound quality is great. You can even set the equalizer customized manually.- Nice FM radio- Audio recordingCons:- FREEZES all the time.  Very frustrating, the hair pulling kind.  If you have playlists with more than 100 songs, there is a lag about 10 seconds to switch form one playlist to another.  If you have 500 songs, how about waiting for three minutes in between? And while it is frozen, you cannot change the volume, go back to previous menus, etc.- Songbird is slow.  Too slow at times.- One of the bigger playlists imported from Itunes came out empty.- Sharp edges- Buttons are stiff.  I either need to hold it with two hands, or put my forefinger and support the top to keep it from falling when I am pressing the down button.- On/off button is in awkward position.  It is being blocked by the earphone plug.", "\"The Good:* Good sound quality* Intuitive navigation and controls* Songbird media management softwareThe Bad:* Small screen makes for poor video and picture experience* Stock earbuds are uncomfortable* No expandable storageOverall:Setup:  Philips has taken an approach that is meant to save cost in including the Songbird software on the device itself.  This is a good choice because it both saves the one time use CD and the hassle of having to download the software.  However, once installed on your PC it would be a good idea to delete it from the player so that it will not take up space for your media.  While you do not have to install the software, it does make upgrading the firmware on the Vibe a cinch.  For media management you can always use WMP if that floats your boat instead.  Songbird borrows heavily from iTunes for its design, and it is a fully functional media management program.  Once you connect the Vibe for its initial charge and upgrade the firmware, you can load media.Music Transfer:  Songbird presents a drag and drop transfer capability that is similar to using Windows Explorer.  Once Songbird recognizes your Vibe, you can drag music by artist, album, song, or playlist on the \"\"Music\"\" area on your Vibe.  During transfer you will see a spinning circle until it is complete.  I find this method more intuitive than WMP's \"\"Transfer List\"\" for syncing.  That always seemed like a clunky intermediate step that shouldn't be necessary.Video Transfer:  This works much the same way as music transfer.  I did find that some of my videos would not transfer to the device.  It seems that Songbird will not let you transfer videos with a resolution higher than the Vibe's 320 x 240 resolution.  It's nice that it prevents you from transferring unplayable videos, but it would be nice to give the user feedback rather than make them guess.Music Playback:  While I have sound quality listed as a positive for the Vibe there is a catch.  The first thing that you will need to do is throw the earbuds that come with it in the trash.  I have taken to the in-ear style earbuds, but the Vibe ships with earbuds that rest outside your ear.  To me this style is horribly uncomfortable, and you lose so much of the sound.So I popped in my V-Moda Vibe (purely coincidence in name) earbuds that I had as a spare set.  Once doing this I put the Vibe through its paces with a variety of music.  For rock I went with Guns `N Roses' Chinese Democracy and Alice in Chains' Black Gives Way to Blue.  The Vibe doesn't quite match the Creative Zen X-Fi in capturing sound detail, but it is not bad.  The dialog at the beginning of Chinese Democracy was audible but at a much lower level.  For rap I tried the Beastie Boys' Hot Sauce Committee, Part 2 and K'Naan's Troubadour.  The bass was ample without being muddy or overbearing.  Rounding things out I went with Melody Gardot's My One And Only Thrill, Dido's Life For Rent, and Johnny Cash's American II: Unchained.  Across all of these styles I was pleased with the Vibe's playback.  Rather than using the Equalizer settings and having to change between genres I turned on the \"\"FullSound\"\" feature.  I expect that this will be adequate for most users.  True audiophiles will be looking for a higher class device.Display:  With a mere 1.5\"\" screen video playback and picture viewing is more or less a lost cause.  Videos were very grainy, and the storage is better used on music.  The display is adequate for album art and close-up pictures.  However I would still use the space for what the player does best and load up on music.Navigation:  The Vibe has a pretty standard tree navigation structure with up/down and left/right arrows.  The play/pause button serves as the \"\"select\"\" button.  It is fairly intuitive.Radio:  The FM radio tuner on the Vibe works as expected.  This can be handy at the gym as some places broadcast the TV audio over a radio frequency rather than connecting the cardio machines with a headphone jack.Voice Recording:  While I don't have a regular need for a voice recorder, I tested out this feature on the Vibe, and it does a good job.  It will record up to 4 minutes at a time which should be adequate for most quick reminders.Value:  The two main competitors to the Philips GoGear Vibe are the Sandisk Sansa Fuze+ and the Creative Zen Mozaic EZ300 - both in comparable 8 GB the Vibe has the smallest screen at 1.5 \"\" vs. 1.8\"\" and 2.4\"\" respectively.  The Fuze+ also has a microSD card expansion slot.  It really comes down to how important videos and microSD are to you.  All things being equal you are probably safe making a price based decision.Overall:  The Philips GoGear Vibe is a solid mp3 music player.  It is easy to use, and it comes with a solid media manager application in Songbird.  There may be better choices if you need video or more than 8 GB of storage.  Please feel free to ask questions if there is something that I have not covered.\"", "I have 7 Philips Vibe so I decide to order another one. I was wrong to assume that because I have such positive experiences with the older Vibe that I can expect similar performance from this newer Vibe.I was wrong!Bad layout, slow response, bad design, and bad battery life make this one of the worst MP3 player I have ever had.", "Updated:  4-6-2014........I continue to use this almost daily for over 3 years and it still plays flawlessly. I have never had an issue with it, the battery has held up well and will still run a week or so of use per charge. I do not know if this is even still in production, but if it is and you need one........it is well worth it.------------------------------------------------------Updated:  I have now used this player for a couple of weeks and have no issues at all with it. I have read some of the other reviews with various complaints, but mine has worked flawlessly. I charged the battery when I first got it and had to charge it last night for the first time since, and it was not completely depleted then. This is after using it almost nightly for 2 - 4 hours each. It has started right up every time and plays great. Again, it is on a par with any other unit I have and I have no reservations about recommending it to others. I may have to buy a couple as gifts down the road.----------------------------------------------------I have only used this player a couple of days, but so far I am well pleased. The sound is good (comparable to any other MP3 player I have) and the quality of construction seems to be excellent.  The Full Sound that some have commented negatively on simply seems to be the bass boost as found on some other units. I turned mine off, but it seemed to be no better or worse than other units.The FM radio plays very well. I have other units that also have the FM capability, but this unit seems to do a better job of it.The unit is very intuitive to use and functions well. I have had no issues of any sort so far. The battery seems to have a reasonably long life.......18 to 24 hours is better than most other units I have ever used.As for the software.....I just drag and drop using my windows.  Works fine and as for the reviewer making comments about having only 3 playlists......I don't know.  I usually don't create many playlists and all the songs are available as songs, groups, albums or you can go into the folders menu and play the album from there. I have had no issues with being able to access any songs I have on the unit.I have roughly 3G of music on mine and it does very well with everything.As for the on/off buttom of the bottom next to the phone jack......just use your fingernail to slide the switch. Works fine with no problems. And the comment about the phone jacks being loose, not going in completely, etc....I have no experienced this. Mine plug in fully and have no static issues at all.The unit is definitely worth the price and works well......as good as any other.I have Cobys, RCAs, Sansas, Sylvanias and some others. This is equal to any of them.Buy it, enjoy it and have a good day.", "\"I was really worried when I read all the negative reviews for this little mp3 player, but as it turns out I'm very satisfied with mine.Here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:- Great Sound (As a matter of personal preference, I keep the \"\"Full sound\"\" setting on because it offers a good level of bass--I haven't found any equalizer settings better than the default either)- AMAZING FM radio - My old mp3 player also had an fm radio function but it was horrible and couldn't even pick up local stations clearly.  The GoGear gets incredible reception.  It clearly picks up more stations than my car radio.  This is my favorite function.- Easy menu/navigation - There's a choice of folder view or just \"\"music\"\" view.  The folder view lets you select from music folders you may keep your files in.  The music section just combines all mp3 files together in one big mess.  I prefer the folder view because I like to easily find full albums or my foldered audio books, however I like shuffling randomly through my entire collection when running/working out with the music view.  Additionally the next, back, menu, volume buttons are all easy to navigate through and not confusing at all.- Nice size - It's about the same size as the number pad on my keyboard, and very light weight.  The screen is tiny, but still shows artwork clearly and vibrantly.  Though I would never watch a serious video on such a tiny screen, the sample video that came with looks shockingly vivid so that I would imagine music videos or even silly youtube sensations would look perfectly satisfactory.  The metal shell feels sturdy and strong enough to survive severe drops.- Battery life - it takes a little longer than I'd like to charge up via usb, but it must be because there's so much juice to hold.  A fully charged battery could easily last a week of heavy use, and probably a month of occasional listening.- plays .flac file songs - I rip all my CDs in .flac format because lossless is best and I was very pleased to see the Vibe played them all perfectly.  Granted I typically convert my flacs into lower quality mp3s so I can fit in more music, but it's nice to know I don't HAVE to.- Price - for 8gb this is very affordableAnd for my con list..- Sound quality - I stand by that the sound is great, especially for such cheap mp3 player, but it isn't going to blow your mind.  Certainly it's good enough, for working out, walking around, jogging, etc, but if you're looking for an mp3 player with bose-like magic (yes, they exist) this probably isn't your best bet.- Charging - there's no option for wall outlet charging, so if you can't get to a USB before the battery runs out.. well, you're just out of luck.Overall, obviously the pros outweigh the cons.  Unless you are a serious audiophile and refuse to listen to anything that's not perfection or don't like charging via usb, there's really nothing to hate about the product.  I didn't have any of the other problems other customers claimed to have (not connecting to computer, headphone plug wrong size, sticking files, short battery life, etc) so I would have to assume Philips became aware of those issues and promptly fixed them.\"", "1. The packaging.It comes in a really annoying blister pack. They try to help you with perforations but you need scissors (as indicated on the packaging).2. The ThicknessWhen you take it out of the package you realize it's a lot thicker than what the packages lead you to believe. Only a portion of it is in front of the paper inside, leading you to believe it's thin.Now this led me to believe it's designed to trick grandparents to buy this for their grandchildren who really wanted iPods.3. Windows RequiredI don't have a Windows computer and never will.4. QualityLow quality plastic, low res display. cheapo headphones.If you are not even going to compete in the market why bother putting out a product? Sounds kinda ok though if you manually want to manage files on it.", "This Philips MP3 player is the best I've used. I've had Creative, Rio, and SanDisk MP3 players in the past. GoGear Vibe is easy to use, buttons are convenient to press even while I'm moving, 8GB is plenty of space for my needs, the sound is of good quality, the display is clear and easy to read, the charged battery lasts a long time, and loading music is a snap.It's nice that it has a regular USB connection instead of a proprietary cable. If the cable that came with it is not handy, I can easily find a cable that will work to add to or change my music. And of course I like that it will charge from the computer rather than a separate cable like some of my older players. Loading music from the computer is intuitive and easy to navigate. Navigating through options on the player itself was fairly simple to figure out at first and now it is second nature for me. My only problem is the volume controls. There are two small buttons at the top for higher and lower volume and they can be difficult to press. I suppose that is preferable though to having a dial or protruding buttons that can easily be moved and give me a sudden roar of sound.I don't use the radio much, but when I have it gets good reception. There is room for 20 preset stations, although I could probably fill only half of that at best. Likewise, I do not have much need for the microphone and recording, but I tried it. Using it is straight-forward and the result is a clear recording.I found that the headphones provided were uncomfortable. They hurt the front part of my ear. I generally do not like earbud headphones, so I swapped them with my old vertical over-the-head set. Now I couldn't be happier with the ease of use and performance of this MP3 player.", "I requested this item through the Vine program and chose to give it 2 stars based on my observations. The MP3 player feels sturdy. The buttons to change songs are easy to press which is a positive and a bit of a negative. Thankfully, as noted already, there is a lock button to prevent accidental surfing. The earbuds are just your stock cheapie fare, I advise getting something different. The shell for this MP3 player is nice looking, but a little sharp on the bottom.I plugged mine into the computer and something quickly flashed on the screen, though I could not tell what it was. I left it to charge and after I tried to turn it on, nothing. Tried to reset and still nothing. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the item any further for sound, software or usage. I believe a couple other reviewers have noted issues as well. I also believe the value just is not here, either. So my conclusion is 2 stars. Maybe I'm a little sour over the clamshell case and the overzealous extraction needed to wrest this thing from its prison.We have 2 basic Coby MP3 players and while you have to LOL cause they are cheap, they have been very reliable for us through daily usage for 1-4 hours a day of working out.", "I now own two of these players (1 is a 4 GB and my new one is an 8 GB). I have noticed a slight improvement in quality of the product in my opinion. When comparing it to my 2 year old 4 GB player, the new one seems to feel more solid and more sturdy. The audio jack is way tighter than my older one and the buttons are crisp and tight.Same interface, easy-to-use, and it was built to play music. I also should mention that it does play FLAC files as well.The only thing I have issues yet (and could never get it to work) is to play video files on it as it appears to be kind of complex, which is why of the 4/5 stars. Other than that, it is a solid product.Now that I own two of these players, I have no issues with them. Great deal!", "\"Summary: Does what it's supposed to but I'd probably consider other options...I had to do a reset within the first hour of playing.  It just started clicking and wouldn't respond to anything.  I thought it was bricked until I saw the \"\"Reset\"\" pinhole - didn't lose any music but not confidence inspiring.Background - I've had a Nike PSA/Play, Ipod Nano, Sandisk Sansa e250, Rio Forge prior to this.  I use them primarily for exercising and only occasionally for listening to podcasts or music in the car or at my office (through exterrnal speakers or aux in)The clamshell packaging and lack of accessories pretty much says it all - this is a product which primarily competes on price.  It's a solid little brick, certainly larger by more than half than the equivalent Ipod Nano, but of course the price is almost a third.  What I found a bit odd is that there is a \"\"plug\"\" on top which suggests there was a button there that was deleted, also there was plenty of stuff laser etched on the back but the serial number and model number are on a sticker on the back - it just gives me the feeling that this is a \"\"Label Engineered\"\" product rather than something that Philips really spent a lot of time and energy on.Other folks said they had to install Songbird.  I haven't though I guess I'm trying to decide whether I want to (so I can do the firmware update)  That's one reason I disliked the Ipod - I typically just want to dump an album or a few songs to the player, rather than have to let it update for me.The earbuds were standard OEM quality which is to say they are thoroughly mediocre but since I use these for exercising the headphones I use areSony MDR-AS35W Sports Headphones Lightweight with Powerful Bassor else hook up with an Aux in or external speakers so not a big deal. FM reception not as good as my Rio Forge or my Sandisk Sansa e250, both of which have expansion capability.The power button is also the lock button - you'll definitely want to lock it as I found it often repeated or skipped songs while I was running or when I had it in a pocket.I haven't tried to convert any videos - it comes with a small demo video which is decent quality on the tiny screen, but I can't see myself watching a movie on this when my phone plays movies with a larger screen and a lot more convenience.  If you're really sensitive to price, as an alternative I'd consider either theCoby 1.8 Inch Video MP3 Player with FM, 8 GB Flash Memory MP620-8GBLK (Black).  On the other hand if you want something nicer for just a little more I'd consider the or theSanDisk Sansa Clip+ 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)which has a built in clip and appears to be at least 30% smaller.  Another option is theSanDisk Sansa Fuze 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)but that's a little more.Likes: Color screen, ability to \"\"drag and drop\"\" music, video capability, lanyard slot - ideal for running or keeping it secureDislikes: No expansion slot, FM reception is marginal, no clip\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05912003666162491, 0.008687100373208523, 0.001128046540543437, 0.0020373358856886625, 7.240092236315832e-05, 0.03256343677639961, 0.00533658592030406, 0.012223094701766968, 0.0032434132881462574, 0.0431160144507885, 0.009301652200520039, 0.14369788765907288, 0.02087661251425743, 0.0009448225027881563, 0.006425917148590088, 0.005729100666940212, 0.0016902039060369134, 0.06939951330423355, 0.0077721369452774525, 0.07813279330730438, 0.026562608778476715, 0.12637722492218018, 0.0004912266740575433, 0.15435385704040527, 0.0011804088717326522, 0.001011647516861558, 0.0056491126306355, 0.15357406437397003, 0.00618402985855937, 0.009491556324064732, 0.0011082154233008623, 0.0025178862269967794]]}
