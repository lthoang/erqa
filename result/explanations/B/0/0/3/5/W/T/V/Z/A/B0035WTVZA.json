I had read all the specs and seen the pics of the camera, and wanted to find out if it was all style and no substance, or if there really was a heart inside the beast. The shop owners opened the box for me to inspect, attached the screen protector, strap and lens cap string, and I took it for a spin before I even left the shop.Before I say anything more, I'd better let you know my digital camera background. I've been using them ever since they first came out about 10 years ago. Sony DSC-30, Kyocera SL300 (world's first 3.3 fps limited only by size of memory card), Nikon S4, Canon 350D, Nikon s10, Nikon P90, Pentax k-x. In addition, I have always used mobile phones with cameras- xcute (world's first 3 mpxl mobile phone camera), SE k810, k850, Motorola ZN5, Samsung Innov8, SE Satio. So i've used a wide range of digital cameras.Initial feeling:1. Camera felt lighter than I expected, even with the 4 AA batteries in place.2. Solid plastic, yet at the same time a little hollow.3. Great grip- right side hand grip is deep and rubberised for gripping.4. Thankfully the lens cap has a string attaching it to the shoulder strap- no chance of losing it or wondering where to put the cap when you take it off.5. Lots of buttons at the back. Going to have to refer to the manual quite a bit.6. The \"\"chrome\"\" ring on the bottom right feels a bit cheap. Though I guess use of plastic helps reduce the weight.7. It's amazing how friendly store people can be once you buy something from them. I was dripping sweat- hot day, so they gave me a cup of water :)8. The screen is beautiful. I can't say it enough. It's very clear and bright, even with screen protector on.9. The lens has an INCREDIBLE zoom range- 24mm to 720mm (35mm format) and feels very smooth when you manually zoom.10. Zooming ring has good grip, but the pattern isn't attractive.11. Shop owner told me the lens is 58mm diameter- that's good because I can use my IR and UV filters.12. Electronic view finder is ok, but I find for \"\"bridge\"\" cameras they tend to be small in size. Only the dslr's have eyepieces which are a good size which is comfortable for your eye. Ignoring the size, the EVF quality is good, and you may have read about the sensor next to it, which activates the EVF when you bring your eye to it. So the 3 inch LCD screen turns off and the EVF turns on when you bring your eye to the EVF.What about the photos?13. Really good. I've taken about 100 photos so far, mostly at night. You have to be quite steady, even with the shake reduction function on (there are 4 options for shake reduction!!!), especially at the maximum zoom. But if you are, then the photo is very very good and sharp. Not quite as sharp as the Pentax k-x, which is known for it's low light performance, but it's pretty damn good. It's certainly good enough for me. Colours seem accurate and bright. Focusing in good light was pretty fast. Focusing in low level light was slower. In poor light it might even hunt for 2-4 seconds and flash a focusing light. It takes about 1 to 3 seconds to save a photo, so it's not high speed unless you use that function.14. The focusing is active. That is on auto, it will focus on faces, and even if those people are moving around, you can see the focus square remain glued to their face. My friends had to move side to side pretty fast for the HS-10 to lose the lock.There are so many fancy functions on this camera that I have really only just scratched the surface of what this baby can do. But I'm very glad to say there is substance in the HS-10. If you are in the market for a bridge camera, the HS-10 should definitely be on your shopping list.Added 15th April 2010.----------------------Despite the overcast and rainy conditions which plague me whereever I go, I've taken another 120 odd photos during the  periods of \"\"only\"\" cloudiness and intermittant sunshine.15. The photos are 24mm and at 720mm have differing sharpness. Colour is good for both though.At 24mm, you can see the whole photo, but you quickly see grainy outlines when you try to zoom in.At 720mm, the photo remains surprisingly sharp when you enlarge or zoom in on the photo. Not quite the same sharpness as my Pentax k-x, but much better than I expected.16. I've always had high zoom cameras and each time I buy up, I get surprised by how much closer I can get to a subject. This time though, I noticed something new. Usually, if I take a photo at the widest angle and then one at max zoom, you can see how much closer you can zoom in because you can usually see the surroundings around the object to compare with.This time however, you can zoom in on something that looks like a little dot in the 24mm photo and it's so close that you literally can't tell it's a zoomed up photo because it looks like a totally different photo.eg: I was on an overhead walkway and took a 24mm photo of the road. A traffic light was about 400 metres ahead. I zoomed in and I got a clear photo of the back of 2 cars and the licence plates. You'd think I had been standing just 5 metres away with a normal camera it was so good.In another example, I took a 24mm pic of an outside wall of a very colourful shopping centre. It's about 6 storeys high, so ground floor shop windows look like dots. When I zoomed to 720mm through the window, I got a very clear photo of the inside of the shop, with no reference to the outside of the building wall at all.This zoom is POWERFUL.I have no idea what the next generation of zoom lenses will allow us to do when they go to, say 850mm, 1000mm plus!17. f stops seems pretty good.I can take close ups of flowers and have both foreground and background nicely out of focus.18. Do keep a steady hand. Brace yourself against a pole or solid object if you can. It really helps in taking a sharp photo. It has good image stabilisation, but it's not a miracle worker.Thanks again all for reading :)Update 1st May 2010-------------------19. I've taken a few more photos and can say the following. The daytime photos are good. Not quite as good as my Pentax kx, but good. Sharpness, colour, detail are all more than acceptable. The lens is great for portraits, and the zoom speaks for itself. The tiltable screen makes the camera much more versatile than a fixed screen camera too.20. There are two areas that I find the camera disappointing.The first is the time needed to save each photo- 2 to 3 seconds. It's pretty slow. In comparison, my Pentax kx is just take the photo and instant save. Granted, most non dslr cameras are also non instant picture saving, but it seems even slower than my Nikon s10 and Kyocera sl300r, or even my Motorola ZN5 mobile phone.The second is photo viewing software. Firstly, it's not so easy to view multiple photos because it enlarges the picture you have the cursor on, so it covers the photos next to it. Secondly, as has already be noted by some disappointed reviewers, deleting a photo takes you right back to the end. If you've got hundreds or thousands of photos, that's a real irritant. It's true that holding down a direction on the chrome ring will very very quickly flick through the photos to get you back to where you were, but it's a real hassle.At least on the other hand, when you connect to the computer, there is only 1 folder for the photos, unlike my nikons, which have numerous folders \"\"100dscn\"\", 200dscn\"\" etc.21. Finally, I've taken a few videos and I've found the HD vids all look smooth on the camera LCD, but very jerky, kind of frame by frame, when i play on my computer. I don't have this problem if I record in 640 x 480 (320?) format though. It's probably my computer being old, but I wonder if anyone else has this problem?Thanks again for reading :)Edit 19th April 2011--------------------I ended up selling my HS10 last year for two main reasons. Writing times were too slow, and the software for reviewing photos was poor. I mean- deleting a photo and taking you to the very end again is pretty bad when you've got hundreds or thousands of photos on your card.But the reason I'm adding a bit here is that I've been following the reviews of the Fujifilm HS20, which was released recently. It seems to have taken care of most of the problems I mentioned- quicker writing speed, and viewing and deletion of photos, and added a new problem instead- overheating of some part of the camera, which causes the camera to cease working. I can say that for all the hundreds of photos I took with the HS10, I never had overheating for a problem.Such a pity that Fujifilm can't get such a fantastic camera right.\"", "\"Let me preface my review by saying that I really wanted to like this camera.But my final conclusion, as someone who enjoys amateur photography and does event photography on occasion, is that the Fujifilm FinePix HS10 is a sub-par camera on every level.This camera is one of those in-between products; a product that can not find its true idenity and is thus stuck in limbo of bad product mixes. Fujifilm FinePix HS10 is neither a point-and-shoot nor is it an SLR. It's manufacturers wanted to accomplish both and, as is sadly often the case, wound up accomplishing neither.As compared to any point-and-shoot on the market, Fujifilm FinePix HS10 is perhaps a more comprehensive product. Yet, the retail price far exceeds almost all other point-and-shoot cameras on the market (Nikon Coolpix P6000 13.5MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoomis an exception).A lot has been mentioned about the impressive 30 meters wide lens on the Fujifilm Finepix HS10. Admittedly, that is what attracted me to this camera as well. Still, what good is a long distance lens if it takes blurry shots at any distance?As compared to the Canon and Nikon low-end DSLRs, well, I think it's not fair to Canon and Nikon to do that. It's not unreasonable to purchase any of the Canon Rebel cameras or Nikon D30/D40 series for a little over $100 on top of the price of the Fujifilm Finepix HS10. Yet, buying those cameras guarantees quality and performance and longevity that I haven't seen in my experience with Fujifilm Finepix HS10.After several sessions that were spent studying all the possibilities of the settings - trust me, this is not your average, \"\"Figure it out on your own sans manual\"\" electronic device, I decided that I was ready to use this camera as my primary camera for a photoshoot.To that end, I had taken the camera, and the Fujifilm 4GB SDHC card that came with the camera, on a photoshoot of my niece. Out of about 20 pictures, I was able to capture only one without noise - the camera's shutter-speed is simply not quick enough to reflect the movement of children (or even the most subdued animals, such as my dog).Half-way through the photoshoot, with the camera being about two months old, the camera showed the screen of death. I received an \"\"unable to read card\"\" message. This was frustrating and disappointing - I was able to restore the lost pictures off the memory card with my computer software, but I am reluctant to ever trust my Fujifilm Finepix HS10 again. The worst thing for a photographer is to go somewhere and to have something go wrong with the equipment.Even if I found this camera's manual sufficient in explaining all the settings, even if I found the camera's lack of clarity and stability not intrinsic to the basic quality of a good camera, even if I found the fact that the camera does not improve my good picture ratio but diminishes it, I'd still be unable to recommend this camera based on its loss of fidelity and stability when it came time to deliver pictures during a photoshoot.\"", "I have been trying this camera out for about 5 days now and overall I ma satisfied with it. There was a lot of hype and high expectations for weeks prior to its release and it meets some expectations and in my opinion does not quite meet others but that could be my lack of expertise and the need for more practice.It is a nice sized camera, weight proportionate with many neat features, some I am still sorting through but generally,the quality of the photos are very good and the 1080 HD video extremely good.  As it seems with most digital cameras the better the light, the better the quality of the photos and video.The manual zoom is nice and works well though it seems to be jerky (maybe it will smooth out with time. The 30X optical is very good and I have uploaded several photo's some of which are close up's of a Green jay which came very well. The night scene which I uploaded disappointed me but since uploading it, I have adjusted it with Photo-shop Elements and it came out fairly decent. it is worth saying that the noise on that pic' appears to be fairly low.The video and still have plenty of battery life auto setting has worked fairly well for me as has many of the other settings, others I  need more time to experiment with and will add a later update.Battery life seems to be pretty good, I have taken about 150 photos and maybe 25 minutes of video with the Alkaline batteries that came with it.The build quality is reasonable, I have seen better (and I have seen worse!) but I think it should last me quite a while.It did come with software though I have not used it.My main reason for wanting this camera is to be able to take quality pictures of my friends & family, of wildlife and a few sports events thus the need for a long zoom and this camera will do what I need.Low light capability is not quite up to my expectations (yet), and I find the zoom a bit jerky but overall it appears to be a good camera that, in my opinion is a bit overpriced and I expect this camera to be selling for less than the list price within a few months (I have already seen it on marked down on one site but still preferred to buy from amazon). I also suspect that Fuji will bring out a firmware update fairly soon to address a few issues I have seen on forums.I always say that the most important thing a camera should do is take great photos, and it pretty much satisfies me in that area. The video and a few other features make it worthwhile to me.If you are thinking of buying this camera, it get my approval but check out some forums to see if it suits you (there are some really good expert opinions and uploaded pic's that should help most folks with their decision.UPDATE 9-4-2010 Still happy with the camera, I wanted to post a note about a comment a reviewer posted in his review that he is using a Vivitar 2800 D accessory flash, well I immediately went onto ebay and found a used one as a buy-it-now for $16.00. I ordered it and have been trying it out. It is a really nice flash that was a bargain for the price. It's important to note that the reviewer says it must be the  2800 D and NOT the 2800 (minus the D) because he says that model has a different voltage.I just wanted to let everyone know that if you need a decent flash that is an absolute bargain, give the 2800 D a shot, it woks very well!", "\"I know I'm going to sound like I flippantly gave this camera review a \"\"5\"\" for every category, but honestly if you can fall in love with a camera...I did. I have had a Canon Rebel (with several lens and expensive flash) for about 5 years now, but this camera makes me want to sell my Canon because it doesn't even begin to compare. This camera screams THE FUTURE of cameras...it does everything I wish my Canon did, including record HD video! The more I explored this cameras qualities the more I drooled. I can't say enough about the features, quality and ease of use. It's taken me years to learn how to use my camera more professionally and not just shoot in automatic, but this camera has the best of both worlds---it's got super options, but is easy enough for your technically challenged friends to use.PROS:-Easy to set up-Extremely lightweight (compared to my Canon Rebel)-Can attach a external flash-Zooms from 24-720mm (you can literally be right up on an object vs 6 inches away, and you can clearly capture objects far away in the distance)-Huge view screen-You can take the pictures by using the view screen (like a point n shoot camera) unlike most professional cameras I've used-You can adjust the aperture while actually seeing how it will effect the object you are shooting without having to do test shots-Menus are easy to navigate-I didn't even read the manual and was able to figure out all the features-Helpful hints that pop up (great for someone unfamiliar with camera terms)-You can shoot Panoramic shots (180 degrees)-You can switch easily from pictures to HD video (with a 4G card in I can record 30 minutes)-Uploading photos was just as simple as my Canon-Picture quality amazingThis is the perfect camera who wants to shoot higher quality pictures, but is afraid of all the scary adjusting required by other non-point and shoot cameras.CONS:-Can't buy other lens to attach...however who needs to? It's ranging of adjustment is so great you literally save money here by never needing to buy any other attachments!\"", "\"I majored in art in college with my areas of emphasis being photography and pottery. It was at that time that I fell in love with the Nikon brand and learned about how they finely grind their lenses for greater clarity even if you enlarge your photos to poster size...where other cameras would fail. Since then, I have never carried any other brand and said I never would.I was able to try out this camera from Amazon's Vine program so I will start by saying I would have never picked it or tried it any other way. I will put myself down by saying I was very much a camera snob, without realizing it...stuck on one brand.At first my bias was evident. Used to Nikon cameras I was not happy that I didn't immediately know how to work this one and there was no manual to help me. In all honesty, that's still a negative for me. It's not that it's hard to use by any means...even someone who never used a camera before will figure it out...but knowing how to navigate it really would be faster if a manual CAME with it.  I printed out the manual and it took up a notebook binder. Kind of bizarre but it also does a lot. Much of the information you may never need.The first thing I was impressed with was how lightweight is was. Half the weight of my other cameras and when I travel that really is a BIG bonus.But that doesn't matter if all you do with it doesn't come out wonderful. I have been using the camera a month now non-stop prior to writing my review of it. I am amazed that it came with a lens that can focus so well upclose without it being an \"\"upgrade lens\"\" which I've always had to do with my Nikons.  There is a bird's nest that is above my stereo speaker on my porch. I knew there were baby birds in it because I could look down through the slats from my upstairs porch but I really couldn't see them well. I also didn't want to get close to the nest and scare the mamma bird...so I stood in my back doorway, probably 12 feet from this nest, and I took a close up of not only the nest, but the babies too. And I mean so close up that I can see the insides of their mouths and every tiny feather. What I couldn't see at all with my naked eye no matter how I tried, was pretty amazing when I pulled that photo up on my computer screen (I will repost the photo here shortly).Here's why:It automatically \"\"read\"\" that I was focusing on the nest, and just as a professional would do if they manaully adjusted the f-stop, the background behind it was softer. A 7 year old child, therefore, could snap a photo and take some amazingly professional shots with this---automaticaly. The baby birds were sharp and clear...I gag when I say this but I kinda think it turned out better than with my top-of-the-line Nikon. And this is WAY cheaper. I don't WANT to like it more. But I swear to you my photos were crisp and clear and with perfect lighting and focus.True test: I have a one of the professional photo printers that prints out poster size prints. This is when you see the clarity, any fuzz, etc.It rocked...sharp, clear images. I was shocked. Great lens, great focus.The video was equally as easy to use and turned out with excellent clarity and I own both the Mino and the the Ultra camcorders to compare it to (my reviews of those are on Amazon.)  To now be able to combine both video and still images on this camera when I couldn't before just made me fall in love. If you compare this to the top hand-held camcorders it's almost like you are buying a camera and getting the camcorder free. It not only has stereo sound rather than mono--most of them have mono--but it also, much to my surprise has 3x image stabilization which some of the top models don't have...so it automatically makes your videos less shaky, more professional.Do I think it should come with a manual so that you don't have to print one out? Heck yes. At least of some basics. Is it simple for anyone once you glance over the main points of the manual? Yes.But that's not as important as what you wind up with. I am sorry Nikon, but I keep grabbing this one. Lighter, incredible results, great zoom, simple, with a camcorder. Dreamworthy. And it even seemed better in low light and comes with a greater zoom lens that adjusts automatically from regular to mega zoom. And I couldn't have been more biased going in.\"", "So far this camera takes excellent basic still shots indoors and outdoors. It recognizes faces and landscapes and makes adjustments.  The manual zoom is impressive and easy to use and focus.  The software allows for easy upload to the computer and applications like facebook or creative memories.  The camera handles easily and is lightweight.I was immediately disappointed with the poor start up guide and the lack of a hard copy user's guide that would explain all of the bells and whistles that make this camera appealing. I would think for the cost Fuji can afford to provide a hard copy in English that describes everything, because one thing this camera does not seem to be is intuitive for less advanced photographers.I have to spend much more time with the manual (once I print it off) and learn the techniques and ways to shoot action shots and panaromas.  The menu and many buttons are not clear in their function.  Unfortunately, the time I've spent with the online manual has not been real clear either.I think this camera has almost an infinite number of uses and options that justify its cost; however, learning how to use them promises to be a challenge.The camera uses 4 AA batteries. An A/C adapter is an optional and separate purchase. 2 commentators below write positive things about the batteries and battery life.", "\"I really wanted to like this camera, it has SO MANY excellent features in it.  But I am going to return it.The superzoom lens goes from 24mm to 720mm, has a nice manual rubber ring for fine control, and so the camera should be IDEAL for sports and stadium or large auditorium live action shots, right?  WRONG.The single biggest problem with this camera is that there is this HUGE DELAY between the time that you press the \"\"shoot\"\" button, and when it actually acquires the photo.  Usually, you can count to 2 seconds before the thing fires off.  You lose the image in the viewfinder during this time, and so if you are trying to track something, you have no way to tell where your subject is located while the camera struggles to take the shot.  I shot lots of poorly framed photos as a result.  I've played with the settings, and tried everything, tried to shut off all sorts of modes that might be slowing it down (e.g., the continuous image stabilization, the continuous autofocus, etc.).  Nothing helps.Then there is the saving of the image files.  Other reviews have mentioned the 5-6 second saves in RAW mode.  Well, even in JPEG only mode, it takes on average about 2 seconds to save (this seems to be faster if the image is brightly lit, for some reason).So, typically, if you are trying to shoot a series of live action shots, there will be a delay of at least 4 seconds between shots.  This makes the camera virtually unusable for anything other than posed portrait shots, or photos of inanimate objects.Now, there is a mode for shooting a series of 6 shots at a rate of 3fps to 10fps.  This works pretty good if you just want to capture a very predictable, easily framed moment in time lasting no more than 2 seconds.  You then have to wait 10 seconds or so afterwards while the photos are saved, so this mode is useless for extended actions.  I did use this mode to take photos of my daughter pole vaulting, an action event which fits the bill.But, what if you just want to shoot shots every 1 or 2 seconds or so continuously, like, when your daughter is walking across the graduation podium to accept her diploma?  At the rate that the Fuji HS10 was capable of shooting, the only way I could guarantee that moment would be captured was with the 1080p video, which is the equivalent of a 2M photo.  The video did not stay focused while tracking during this long distance shot, which was unfortunate.I upgraded my SDHC card to a very expensive Sandisk Class 10 16GB card rated at 30Mb/s.  I should have save my money.  This did nothing for the save speed on this camera.  When I called Fuji tech support to complain about this camera, the guy could only say \"\"Well that's just the way it's designed\"\".  He said that the save speed was only 5Mb/sec.  HA!  So much for getting anything more than a Class 4 SDHC card for this camera.The 1080p (1920x1080) video is a nice feature (although the auto-focus does not work very well as you track somebody).  It is one of the many reasons to get this camera.  Other terrific things built into this camera include:  the panorama feature, the rapid shot series, the high ISO 6400 feature (autofocus does struggle at low light), the many photo action modes, the maneuverable LCD (I actually ended up using the viewfinder a lot more - the long zoom shots are much more stable with the camera pressed against your cheek).I like the AA battery aspect of this camera (only Canon and Kodak seems to still use AA batteries on their cameras), as bitter past lessons have taught me that proprietary lithium batteries are never charged or available when you want them.  I use the Sanyo Eneloops, which are the best NiMH batteries ever, and had no problems with battery life (people who posted reviews stating otherwise need to stop using alkaline batteries, which drain RAPIDLY on digicams, and use these Eneloops instead - other NimH batteries just don't compare to these).But ultimately, despite all the bells and whistles, when I looked back upon this extensive 20 day experience travelling and shooting away with this camera (took it to Stockholm, Reno, Houston, and Los Angeles, taking hundreds of photos and videos), the most frustrating aspect of using this camera was the SLOW CYCLE TIMES.  Electronics are supposedly getting FASTER all the time.  Slow cycle times were a huge complaint with the older digicams, so we should not have to revisit this unpleasant aspect of digicam history.My old Sony DSC-W7 shoots faster than this brick!  Seriously, this little Sony camera has a cycle rate of between 1.5 and 2 seconds between shots, which is 2-3 times better than the Fuji HS10, and the 7M photos it puts out are terrific.  The Fuji HS10 is also slower than the Fuji S2000, which I had reviewed earlier.I suspect that Fuji made a commercial decision to scrimp on putting in faster electronics for this camera, in order to keep it at a certain price point.  And the upgrade to the larger Megapixels (a sexy selling point - whereas taking photos really fast is not a sexy selling point), plus the addition of the many \"\"auto\"\" features without faster electronics was what slowed this camera down, compared to older superzoom cameras in its line, such as the Fuji S2000.  The 5 Mb/sec save speed does not begin to compare with the 14 Mb/sec save speed of the Nikon Coolpix P100.  The P100 also has a 2.5 fps continuous mode at full 10M size which can run for 37 shots (67 continuous shots at 2.5 fps if the photos are scaled back to 5M).In summary, although the camera has a lot of terrific features, it is just too slow for the most common things that I want to use it for, which is to take sequential spontaneous pictures of people at long distance (e.g., sports photography, special event photography in a stadium/auditorium, general tourist street photography).  I could use a lot fewer megapixels on a superzoom camera;  I can't deal with a slow camera.\"", "The pictures from this camera are great, the telephoto takes awesome closeups and it looks like you were standing right up close when it was taken. I tried some night time pictures, the room was very dark, I only knew where the dog was because I could just slightly pick out some white from her fur and I knew where to look. I used the camera with flash to take a picture and it was wonderful, the color was good the lighting was good, no red eye. I just briefly tried the movie setting and it takes a decent movie but I still prefer my regular movie camera for that. The panoramic pictures works great and is easy to use. Closeup pictures of flowers and things (macro) turn out nearly flawless.There are a lot of buttons and dials on this which can be confusing especially since they don't give a regular manual. This is one big flaw that loses a star. For the price of this camera it should have a large manual instead of the poor starter version and then having to refer to the computer for questions. I find this time consuming and frustrating than to have a written manual. This camera has many functions, some I haven't figured out yet and the manual should be printed simply to make it easier to refer to.The lag time between pictures is much too long and this in itself greatly disappoints me. A camera of this quality should take much quicker pictures. I have an old kodak easy share that can be forced to take quicker focused pictures than this camera.I would recommend a good quality rechargeable AA batteries or lithium for this camera. The battery usage isn't too bad but the lithium will be more dependable and last longer.Overall the quality of pictures is very good, if you don't mind the lag time between the pictures then I would recommend this camera, otherwise it might be better to look around a little more.", "\"People Like the HS10--------------------First off, this camera can be a fun camera to use and that's probably one reason why some people like this camera. I liked this camera initially but as time wore on there were just too many snags that ultimately gave me reason to return it.The Deal Breaker: False Battery Status--------------------------------------The first one everyone will be familiar with is the false low-battery status message that this camera displays. Although freshly charged batteries were used, in less than an hour and fifty shots later, the camera shut itself down. The batteries were discharged prior to charging as per instructions, the battery selector was set to \"\"N\"\" for NiMh, and the rating of the batteries was 2000mah. Other HS10 users have been able to take 500 shots or more with this power rating so it isn't necessarily connected to higher mah ratings.Firmware 1.03--------------The problem for this bug was fixed in firmware version 1.02 but my camera was shipped with version 1.03. Yes, there is a newer version. But apparently, the old bug has resurfaced with 1.03 and the battery problem is alive and well. And no, you cannot downgrade back to 1.02 if you get a camera shipped with 1.03.As mentioned before new battery performance (NiMh) is only 50 shots and less than an hour of shooting time before the camera shuts down (at least on my HS10). This is the real deal breaker for me. I called Fuji USA and the techs were in total denial about this issue. \"\"We never heard of a HS10 battery problem,\"\" was their response. At that point, they lost all credibility with me as well as my respect for their customer support. I'm not sure if all newly shipped HS10s exhibit this problem, but mine did. Be sure to take this into consideration if you are contemplating the purchase of the HS10.The HS10: The Good and the Bad---------------------------------As far as all around performance, it has a nice range of in-camera effects, fair low-light shooting capabilities, and of course, the 28-720mm monster zoom lens. Its auto focus isn't always spot on when in macro mode, contrasty scenes and in the shade; the percentage of properly focused images was only 1 in 20 when shooting flowers in the garden with average zoom using the auto focus. The noise from images above ISO 400 can be a bit much and the overall picture quality is about par for the course. The viewfinder imgae is totally insufficient in size and my guess is that Fuji forgot to add the proper diopter lens to it to magnify the display properly. This renders the viewfinder virtually useless because it is small...really, really small.The Big Picture----------------The HS10 offers some interesting features for a certain demographic, and if you fall into the category of photographers that has primarily used point and shoot cameras, the HS10 offers you an interesting bag of tricks. There are bells and whistles on this camera and this may give you a certain amount of entertainment for a time.The slow motion video feature is virtually useless if you are planning to use the highest 1000fps setting because the frame size is only an inch or so in width (Fuji conveniently leaves this info out on their advertisements). Low light performance for outdoor shooting or overcast conditions will require bumping up the ISO to at least 800, but this is also where lots of noise starts to show up in photos. If the scene you are shooting is busy or you're zooming in, the auto focus won't be able to select the proper lock-on. For 4x6 prints, vacation shots, or informal picture taking, the HS10 may suit your needs while giving you the look of using a DSLR.Conclusion------------If you are seeking a camera that has a respectable battery life, good low-light capabilities, good auto focus, and good image quality, you may want to hedge your bets by looking at other models. Don't let the siren call of a 30x zoom lens lull you into its spell because it's the overall performance of a camera that matters.Perhaps the next iteration of the HS10 will solve many of the problems you have read about. But until then, make sure you do your homework by checking out as many reviews on this camera as possible as well as user experiences posted on the Internet.I was well aware of all the issues revolving around the HS10 but hoped against hope that they weren't all valid. In my particular case, and sadly, many of the concerns proved to be true. (Yes, I read the whole camera manual so no user error here. ;D) It's very possible that there are quality control issues surrounding the HS10 and it may just be a matter of getting one of the good ones. In any event, a throw of the dice is a little disconcerting in order to get a unit that works.Final Thoughts: FujiFilm USA------------------------------Fuji USA proved to me that they do not care about its customers when they have issues with their products; specifically speaking, the HS10. With this sort of support, or lack thereof, it made it apparent that FujiFilm will not back up its products once you purchase them. This is unfortunate because brand loyalty is destroyed and this will eventually hurt sales. As far as FujiFilm cameras, I won't be back.\"", "\"I am not an expert and I use mostly auto, SRauto, adv1 and adv2 mode. After testing it few days and compare it with my Samsung i6 compact camera (yes, it is cheap and old), here is what I found initially. The raw mode produces excellent outdoor image but poor indoor image (I guess it needs a lot of light and steady hands). The jpg is below average for outdoor and is very below average for indoor; its jpg processing adds a lot of noise!!! I took the indoor pictures with windows open in day light and with flash on. All jpg pictures are soft (very soft). It should not happen to a company with so much experience in camera. It is like a Ferrari car with a bad driver. However, its macro mode is excellent. When zooming to max. (even to a small object), the result is above average too. My Samsung drops its IQ a lot when it zooms to its optical max.I contacted Fujifilm and they told me that Samsung camera is able to set ISO down to 50 for my pictures and with less exposure time comparing with the same pictures I took with HS10. Since HS10 used longer exposure time, my hands were not steady enough to prevent shaking. This is why all my indoor pictures are soft. Samsung i6 has a slightly bigger sensor too. Usually, only the expensive cameras use bigger sensor.He told me to use the \"\"P\"\" mode and adjust the focus and sharpness. I experimented a few settings and now the pictures IQ are closer to the Samsung (still has more noise than Samsung). Here is my setting:= Mode: P= ISO: 100 (I wish I can set it to 50)= Sharpness: Hard= Tone: Soft (it reduces half of the noise)= Color: Hard (color is too light even at \"\"hard\"\", need to change white balance)= WB Fine Tune: +1 (R) , +2 (B)= When zooming to far object, I always set it to macro mode (not super macro)= Focus: Center. Always focus subject at center of the frame, press half of the button, compose the picture, then press the button fully.= Face detection: It works most of the time, but not all the time. I prefer not to use this feature. I use the above technique to focus a person's face before composing the picture.It means that I can't use most of the features on this camera (like the auto, SRauto, SP1, SP2, and adv) with good result for now.But I still decided to keep HS10 because of the following reasons:0) Use AA battery! No more special charger! But I do have a 15 minutes quick charger for my 2000mAh NiMH AA batteries. I will carry one extra set with me all the time. If I don't buy HS10, I would buy Canon SX20IS, it uses AA batteries too with hot shoes.1) To get a manual zoom len with this wide angle and zoom range, I need to pay for a real DSLR camera. And I need to carry two or three lens!! Too cumbersome for me now.2) It would cost much more to do item 1 above. Not wise to do at this economy with less job security.3) Once I tried the HS10 manual zoom len, I fell in love with it. It brings me back my old memory before the invention of digital camera. I used to own the 35mm cameras with manual zoom lens many years ago. It is harder to do a smooth zoom with video, but I don't take video that much with a camera.4) The pictures IQ with the above \"\"P\"\" mode setting are \"\"closer\"\" to my Samsung i6 now. HS10 still has more noise but I can reduce it with software, printer, or printer driver. Also hope the future firmware can \"\"fix\"\" it.5) Raw pictures are very nice if you don't mind the 15MB size.6) Write time is fast now for jpg pictures after I do the following:- turned off red eye removal- say \"\"No\"\" to all save org. image items- say \"\"No\"\" to Image display option- only take 2 to 4 mega pixel pictures. I only print 4x6 pictures, I don't need more than 2 mega pixel. 4+ mega pixel picture is just wasting disk space and take more time to write.- also using a class 10 SDHC card (only $19.95 from Amazon with 5 items gift!)7) Hot shoe! There are not many cameras in this price range with hot shoe. It is needed for taking group pictures! And I don't like those slave flash, they don't always work.Someone said the \"\"raw+jpg\"\" mode gives better JPG pictures, but it is taking too long to write 15MB raw files and I hate to waste space.I am also using the \"\"Zeikos ZE-FLK58 58mm Multi-Coated 3 Piece Filter Kit (UV-CPL-FLD)\"\" with HS10. Only $7.99 from Amazon !! All glasses. I don't see any difference in picture IQ when using the UV filter. No issue with focusing too. This is important to protect the big zoom lens. The CPL filter also works well.Now I just need an external flash for this camera. Any good suggestion to match this camera ?Thanks for those who replied me in the comment page. I posted the reply from Fujifilm in the comment page too.Keep shooting .....\"", "The HS10 is a good bang for your buck. It is a nice top end point and shoot camera that has many features. If you are looking for a all in one this is a great camera. Very nice picture quality in low light setting, great all around camera that can handle most needs.", "First of all if this camera didn't come with an impressive zoom range and a manual type zoom I would have given it 2 stars.  The IQ tradeoff for a 30x zoom range is evident in this camera.  The .jpg images at all ISO's are full of noise and lack clarity when compared to other cameras in this range.  The resoluton reminds me of a 5mp camera of 3-5 years ago.  What is strange even at base ISO is there is plenty of noise left along with evidence of massive noise reduction as well.  The well know water color affect as it's known.  Of course with PP and/or RAW some of this can be mitigated but the lack of pure resoluton cannot be forgiven.  The lighting conditions for my outside tests was very good and I used indoor lighting for low light testing.  So any negative results I don't believe were cause by less than adequate lighting conditions.When compared to other cameras in this class the auto focus was accurate but of average speed in good light and actually quite slow in low light.  And of course it slowed even more at maximum zoom.  There also seemed to have a little more shutter lag than I'm used to when the image stabiliztion was set on #2 for shutter IS only.  The lag improved a little while in #1 IS, continuous, but the lag was still not nearly as crisp/quick as say a Panasonic FZ35 or super quick s100fs.  For a camera of this price range and at this developement stage in cameras I found this shutter lag to be quite lacking.  Maybe the sensor based IS over lens IS was the cause of this, I don't know but it was disconcerning.I did find the metering to be rather consistent and the white balance accurate.  I did not try all the Fuji color modes and many fuctions as it became evident early on I had no intention of keeping this camera.The video in 1920x1080 HD was jerky at times and wavy in others.  However the resolution and colors were great.  Lowering down to the 1280x720 fixed the problems of 1080 HD.  I was using an Adata class 6 Turbo series with a 22mb/s read and 10mb/s write. Maybe this isn't fast enough for the full 1080 HD.I found the build quality to be excellent and the zoom tight and responsive.  The zoom ring was a little stiff but that's normal for a new camera.  Actually much better this way than too loose when new.  And of course the zoom range is magnificent but for this 30x range the IQ has suffered.  The IQ also appeared to be better at the long end.Overall this is an average camera with below averge IQ and above average zoom capabilites.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  But, alas I returned for a refund after using for 3 days.  The other cameras I used as comparison for testing were the Canon SX10 IS and the Panasonic FZ35.  I also own a Fuji s100fs but it's so far ahead of the HS10 it's not worth mentioning.I encourage everyone to view foilage and trees in all pictures at 100% to really see the lack of resolution and the amount of noise smearing being used. Even if you don't normally view or print that large it's imperative to view these to see what I'm seeing and others as well. A quality $500 camera should not show this amount of watercolor affect at ISO 100-200.  Just viewing downsized images and then believing everything is fine is not telling the whole story.Added 4-12-10 from my comments section:1:  To put it short and sweet the s100fs has more resolution, focuses faster, less shutter lag and processes the files much faster than the HS10. The optics are just better on the s100fs as well. With the s100fs you can take pictures one right after the other in RAW normal shooting mode, whereas there is always a lag write time of 4-5 seconds for every shot in the HS10. Since I only shoot RAW and sometimes require quick refocusing and shooting this time delay from the HS10 was one of the deal breakers. The amount of chroma noise in the HS10 shots is also atrocious. Sure on the well exposed shots you have to view it at 100% to see it but it's there in abundance. The firmware has tried very hard to remove the noise and actually created the smearing look called watercolor. Look at the foilage and trees of any shot at 100% and mostly it's just a smeared blob.Even the best shots from the HS10 don't have the crispy punch like the average s100fs ones do. I'm sure in due time many will compose side by side examples with all types but from my 27 years Photography experience and owning over 50 digital cameras in the last 9 years it doesn't take me long to decide on a camera.Bottom line when a camera has poor resoluton, is slow processing and slow functioning I don't want it.2:  Look at any or all photos at 100% to really examine. Some call this pixel peeping but that's what I require. Most of the ones on DPR are downsized 1-2mp pics. The ones which are full sized the noise, attempted noise removal and lack of resolution are readily apparent. If you can't see it you're not looking. Any $200 camera can make a nice 8x10 downsized image and that's what most people are looking at and say WOW those are great. I expect a $500 camera to expose a relatively noise free and high resolution pic at base ISO and viewed at 100%. Otherwise it's useless to me.kd", "My wife bought this for me, after I bought her a Canon T2i.The reason for the purchase, is because we have an old Finepix S9000 and we wanted a new camera with good video capability.Compared to the T2i, the HS10 video quality seems to be superior. The autofocus feature while recording video is very quiet and does a great job of staying in focus, in pretty much any situation that we found.The worst part of this camera is the manual focus capability, or lack thereof. All of the complaints are correct, regarding the focus ring. It is garbage. Also, the manual focus capability in general seems to not even work, so I gave up on even trying.The AS (Anti Shake) features are sub-par to the T2i. I have tried every setting available and have not yet found an AS setting that actually works. In fact, the camera is so sensitive at times, that even the steadiest hand takes a few blurry photos.The HS10 photo quality is pretty good, in general. However, it falls far behind the Canon T2i.The HS10 lens is the second-best, non-removable lens that I have used. The old S9000 had a much better lens, but the HS10 lens zoom capability is the best on any camera out of the box. The HS10 lens quality in general is inferior to the old S9000. The engineering on the HS10 lens is so tight, that zooming in a smooth motion is impossible.The feature pack built into this camera is fantastic, for the novice to mid user level.If you buy this camera, I recommend tinkering with it for a couple weeks before judging it.", "\"I have always been a point and shoot person with my 8.0 megapixel camera that required very little setting. When I received the HS-10 I was completely impressed right from opening the box. The cameral is light weight and very rugged in appearance and feel. It operates on 4 AA batteries. You can use alkaline, NIMH or Lithium with adjustments for each. I have been using the Alkaline supplied batteries and so far the camera has been working well. I will most likely install Lithiums next. Without making any adjustments, my first set of pictures were out of this world. HD clarity and the perfect lighting. The zoom option 30x is very good with minimal if any distortion at the full 30x. I have not yet played with the videio option; however, I will update my review once i have mastered it! The camera comes with a basic operating manual; however, you need to use the supplied CD to review the 150+ page manual. I wish they had came out with a print version as the PDF is hard to follow and take noted on. The 3\"\" lcd screen is very clear (HD) and easy to see in bright sunlight, unlike other cameras. The zoom feacture is manual. There is no lever or button that will do it automatically, at least that I can find thus far.  At this point I would recommend this camera for the beginner as well as advanced user. More to come as I play with the camera!\"", "I just bought my Fuji Finepix HS10 less than a week ago while on a trip to Vegas. I added a few filters (UV and a circular polarizer). When initially testing shots, they were very clear, all the way through the fully extended 720 mm. After adding the filters, I was having an impossible time getting anything but muddled shots at the fully extended range, though it worked fine when bringing the lens back to around 500 mm. No matter what settings I tried, hand held nor tripod mounted, I could NOT get anything but junk at 720 mm. I was in very close contact with FUJI support on this, and they were very responsive, suggesting alternative settings, etc.  Nothing worked. I then thought about the additional filters and could THAT be the cause of the problem. I took off both the UV and circular polarizer ... PROBLEM TOTALLY SOLVED! I had beautiful/clear pics at 720 mm, and hand held was no problem whatsoever. I then added the UV filter (BOWER), still clear as a bell. Adding the circular polarizer (BOWER) brought the problem back immediately. Turning the cp filter had no effect, still lousy ... really lousy ... results at 720 mm. Those of us who bought this thing wanted that 30X range, and not having it caused me intense frustration at first. I have read the reviews here, and apparently more than one person has gone through this. TAKE THE CP FILTER OFF! That should bring you the camera you thought you were buying in the first place.Now: the BRAND of CP FILTER might also be the culprit here, I don't know. Perhaps a better grade cp filter might be the answer if you want to employ a cp filter ...I did not rate the various sub-categories here since I have not used the camera enough to comment with any experience. The same applies to my giving the camera a four, not five, star rating ... not enough use. Since solving my 30X problem, I will run this beast through its paces again, feeling a heck of a lot better now that I know it's not a defect in the camera.BTW:  FUJI has just come out with an update to the firmware, you can find it at:  [...]Regards,  Mike McCaffrey", "\"After researching the \"\"super zoom\"\", non-DSLR cameras I felt that some of this camera's features outweighed the areas where it might not have been the best in its class. Probably the three major advantages to me are the ability to zoom via the zoom ring (rather than buttons), the long zoom range with 24mm (equiv) wide-angle and the ability to shoot RAW format. As far as I could tell image quality should be very acceptable for my uses and the versatility is quite amazing (as it is with most other cameras in its class). The trade-off is a larger and heavier camera than others in its class. This is not necessarily bad as it makes for a very comfortable camera to hold and use.The major issues I have encountered so far are: the small viewfinder image and unshielded viewfinder make the viewfinder very difficult to see and use in bright sunlight, it's minimum aperture of only F8 in all modes except manual and then of only F11, and Fuji's RAW format is not yet recognized by most viewers and photo-editing software.As I become acquainted with my new, DSLR replacement I believe the advantages will offset the less-than satisfactory viewfinder (especially compared to my old DSLR camera) and the limited, minimum apertures. Hopefully I will not regret the loss of my DSLR too much.\"", "Let me clarify. I love this camera, but I wish that it would allow more than 29 minutes of HD footage to be recorded. I have a 32gb class 10 SD card installed, and that is more than enough room to record several hours of 1080p HD footage, but the camera limits it to 29 minute sessions at a time. Apart from that, this is a DSLR killer!", "One of the touted big features of the camera is its ability to do photos in the raw format. It can produce raw files, but they can only be used and edited with the clunky program that comes with the camera. None of the Adobe programs recognize the raw files. The Fuji program was nasty to install (numerous error messages). Every time I fired it up, there were two error messages saying it could not connect to the internet to look for upgrades; despite there always being a strong Internet connection. The program wanted to fire up every time I connected anything to the computer. I finally removed it and had to do a system restore because of things it messed up. If Adobe comes up with a plug-in for the raw files, I am not sure I will use the raw because the camera takes about 5 seconds to store each raw photo.Apart from the raw problems, it is quite a nifty gadget. The manual is only available as a PDF file on a CD. If you want to learn all the nifty features, I recommend printing out the manual. My only other gripe is the lack of any way to connect a cable release.", "Four and a half starsJust got my HS10 yesterday and what surprised me literally first is that it looks and feels like a dslr. The camera isn't big at all and is light. All this with an excellent and very potent lens.Having had many dslr and p/s cameras I was able go through the menu even without reading the manual (Fuji doesn't include the full hard copy of the manual except as a pdf file on the disk--my major complaint about the camera!).The camera is light and easy to use, responsive and simple. Actually, a joy to use and manipulate. Upon further using the camera zoom, the overhead flash does stick out slightly to encumber the use of focusing on the zoom ring. A person with small hands probably won't have much of a problem, but those with larger hands may find it annoying. But you get past that once you see how nice and accurate the zoom is. The lens is sharp all the way through focus without any fringing (all glass in the lens according to Fuji).I shot in raw and there was a short time lag of 2-3 seconds per shot. I haven't tried it in rapid/continuous shooting yet to see if it can fire off a few raw shots (yes, the camera will shot 6 consecutive shots!).The lcd screen is nice and large and colorful. The view finder while nice that it has an automatic sensor that detects your eye, the image quality there is average. I understand that both lcd and view finder only show 97% of the picture which makes you scratch your head. But nothing too bad. The diopter to the viewfinder sharpened nicely according to your vision.As I shot the images in raw, what struck me was how beautiful and rich the shots were. Some pictures even had me applauding. The zoom is fantastic and to be able to go from wide to full zoom in just a snap is wonderful.  I've had dslrs and been lazy about changing lens. The convenience of an all-in-one lens is great. Camera image stabilization works nicely. I did notice that on aperture priority it only goes as far as f8, but in manual you can get f11. Another oddity.I would say that the HS10 is a mini dslr or dslr-like. The nay-sayers and nit pickers you see on the reviews here are being unfair, because they want some great Nikon/Canon dslr which in the end costs big bucks but for $500 with this kind of zoom, CMOS sensor, and many more features (panorama stitch mode, etc.) that the normal dslr doesn't carry, you can't go wrong.Later as I processed my raw photos I was truly impressed with the dslr quality of the images.  The Fuji/silky software is slow but hopefully there will be something out better soon.  Also, a firmware update by Fuji will easily enhance the camera's few foibles.  (I forgot to mention that after first getting the camera and seeing the excellent results I then put on a tinted filter which affected the color saturation.  I then purchased a clear lens filter and all the robust Fuji color is back.  CLEAR FILTER IS THE WAY TO GO!)I do recommend this camera in its class as a high end bridge camera or mini-dslr! More positives than negatives!Read the positive photoblog review on the camera.Also check out the many photos I've included here on Amazon.Good luck to all.  I'll try write later after I've gone through all the features.Third day out shooting I figured out the trick for when the camera doesn't want to focus, you must also set the camera in macro mode and that helps solidify the shot.  The camera sees a close up and thinks its a macro so you must also set the camera to macro!As of April 27, Fuji has a released a firmware update for the HS10!  Go to the Fuji website to update your camera performance.  Good luck.A second firmware update has been issued for the HS10 on May 24, 2010.From my trying it seems that spotmetering allows for the best exposure and shot making.  Without a doubt spotmetering is needed when at full zoom for distant shots to differentiate your subject lighting.", "\"This is truly a lovely camera, the fit and finish, at first look, appear flawless- no rough edges, the seams are almost undetectable, whatever the opposite of \"\"shoddy\"\" is, I'll call it that. The silver pieces- chromed plastic maybe- seem a little bit delicate, in contrast to the body. The buttons and dials relevant to shooting are laid out in an ergonomically correct fashion that they can almost all be easily operated with one hand.A very easy to view LCD screen- 2-3/8 X 1-3/4 pulls out on a n angle bracket where it can tip up fully 90 and downward about 45 The viewfinder has a diopter control for individual adjustment, always nice- but what was a pleasant surprise was how putting your eye up to the viewfinder shuts off the LCD> Nice touch. I prefer to shoot with a VF, so this could mean significant savings of battery life.The memory card door- for the SD chip, is likewise smooth and functions well, as does the chip eject mechanism. As do most all of the other controls. Design-wise, there is a lot to like.Functionally?It's not that I do not like this camera, I will say straightaway that I do, very much. For what it is it is well designed and executed.What I do not like is the pattern of thought which believes a camera of this much complexity and control and possessing features few people will ever learn, let alone use with any success, is somehow a good idea.But I am thinking that my basic premise, perhaps unwise for a reviewer of digital cameras, is that they are inherently dishonest. I just now tried to capture the stunning effects of the light after a dramatic late spring thunderstorm, and it looked like crap. No matter what setting I chose. I have no doubt that even the simplest point-and-shoot film camera would have succeeded. I don't get it.This is my first \"\"real\"\" DSC, so while I should not dwell on my learning curve, I believe it is important to comment accordingly as no doubt some of you reading this may also be first-time shoppers.I have a lot of habits from using a Nikon SLR for many years, and they were of little use in transitioning to this camera. I realize SLR's for years have always been right-hand prejudiced, but it was still possible to carry one comfortably in either hand. The Fuji demands, but the shape of the right side, it must be swung right handed.As I have examined cameras in stores, I was always baffled by the selector dial- what could all those settings be for? And buttons? The Fuji has eighteen. My old Nikon FM2 has one. The shutter. And only five controls. I can't add up all the functions of the Fuji, but here's the descriptions given when you rotate the selector knob. I will not delve into the descriptions, if you really want to know, you'll have to print out and study the 145 page manual like I did:AUTO: Automatic mode setting according to shooting conditionsSR AUTO: Scene Recognition Auto- selects optimum camera settings for certain modesADV: this is a programmable setting which takes you into a sub-menu where the following choices, and  are yours: Motion RemoverMulti-Motion CapturePro Low-LightSP1: Scene Position: \"\"Choose a scene suited to the subject or shooting conditions and let the camera do the rest\"\" So then you have a sub-menu containing 16 choices- i.e \"\"Beach\"\", \"\"Fireworks\"\", \"\"Party\"\", \"\"Sunset\"\", \"\"Night\"\"- so, what to do if you are going to a party at the beach that goes til after dark and then they have fireworks? Change it for each event? What if you get it wrong? Sheesh.SP2: Same as SP2. At least it makes choosing the wrong scene half as likely. As long as you remember to switch, And can remember how they were set up..Panorama: Take ultra-wide panoramic image by sweeping the camera. (The resulting image is of questionable value, except perhaps onscreen.)C: Custom. Shooting mode with user settingM: Manual mode with the shutter speed and apertureA: Aperture Priority Automatic: mode with user setting the apertureS: Shutter Priority AE: Automatic mode with user setting the shutter speedP- Program AE: Automatic Mode with programmed settingGot it? OK, RTFM if you really want to know, then play. I really question the value of so many presettables- a friend of mine with a different brand but similar controls admits he has to refresh his memory if he goes too long between uses. Or has used another brand in the meantime.Seems to me, all you really need is full auto or full manual. A walk down any grocery store aisle will show you immediately how much people like choices, this must be the logic to this trend of design. The more features they build in, relevant or not, the more they can charge. I would think at this point to compare photographers to guitarists- unlikely, I know, but hear me out:  using a ton of bitchin' effects may fool people into thinking you're a decent player, but if you truly are, you only need three knobs. Part- no, most all of being a good photographer is knowing what *is* a great shot, not what device makes one for you.I find the flash assembly, while elegant in appearance and nearly mechanically perfect, also fully blocks the top of the focus ring and half of the zoom. I am to the point where using these two controls is instinctive, and having to compensate for this protuberance is irritating to the extreme. When shooting video, it would take a lot of practice to pull off decently smooth zooms.  And no, I do not wish to \"\"get used to it\"\" or defer to the automatic modes, but I probably will. Not to mention, the zoom ring has a decidedly binding feel as the elements pop out. When using the video setting, the zoom is nearly completely worthless. And not to mention, the illumination provided by the flash seems inadequate at best. Equally strange, if the camera is set to \"\"silent\"\" mode, the forced flash setting is unavailable. I had to disable the sounds all manually before I was able to use it in this manner. Might be a glitch, it makes no sense.As for the flash itself, the delay between shots is simply unacceptable. Fifteen seconds or so. With my very cheap Vivitar flash and my trusty SLR I could pop a shot off every 4 seconds. Not like this is a real life need to be scenario, but with a camera that pretends to be state-of-the-art it just seems absurd. And, not only that: the built-in flash has to be erected before the external can fire. My Vivitar blocks it from full extension, so I cannot really say if it would have helped. The built-in flash is supposed to be adjustable, but I have not found the procedure for that yet.I am tempted to pick up a hot-shoe adapter to see if this can be improved by an external device.For that matter, one of the most important aspects of a digital camera is how fast it gets up to speed. As I mentioned, I can't yet compare the Fuji to others, except my ancient Sony- and I always felt it was really slow to start and shoot. This camera actually takes almost twice as long. Time between shots is slow, I realize this may be due on part to battery condition, and while I am using brand-new Energizer Lithium's, until I put more powerful cells in there I will have to temper this judgment. As far as battery life, I am still on that set, but the ones that were provided with the camera went flat before I was halfway through familiarizing myself with the manual.As far as the choice of AA cells instead of a dedicated pack: my earlier experience with the little Sony finally convinced me I would avoid it again if I could. It seems like a good idea at first to be able to pick up batteries anywhere should an emergency strike, but it seems a dedicated fully charged spare or two should be all one needs. I find even the best rechargeable AA's are often inadequate, and certainly degrade over time. Lithiums cells average $2-3 each, and unless they can power this camera through several full days of shooting, I hate the idea of shelling out twelve bucks every few weeks.The video function, we have yet to talk about. Unlike everything else on this camera, it is operated by a single button and seems fairly straightforward. But no, once again there are still countless choices to be made, frame rate, aspect ratio, high speed, low speed, not to mention almost equally as many playback and in-camera editing capabilities.Image quality? Sometimes excellent, sometimes acceptable. Due to the wide range of choices to the user, I have not found the perfect settings for all the test shots I have made, but over 300 in widely differing conditions I still haven't found the sweet setting.I have not been able to comment on the included software, it seems every device manufacturer included a photo transfer and editing application, some good, some not so. For the most part I stick with what I know- manual transfer and Photoshop. Images may be transferred by removing and reading the SD card, or with the included mini-USB cable. You cannot remove the images from the camera if you use the cable, which I found unusual. There is also a mini HDMI port for direct viewing to a TV. Viewing the images in the camera offers nearly as many choices as do the shooting menus.I am not sure if I could recommend this camera or not, it would take a lot more experience with the variables to confidently say \"\"you'll learn to love it..\"\" To one more familiar with this type of shooting and design I may seem a bit harsh, although I suspect the  self-satisfying wealth of \"\"features\"\" are more the norm these days. There are so many choices for any shot one might make, how could you ever remember which worked best? I cannot say that Fuji is alone in promoting this consumerist-driven orgy of tech, but I can say this: If I could find a simpler digital that delivered consistently good images without so much homework I would probably choose that one.\"", "First off, I'm neither a photography hobbyist or Professional.  And I'm not going to pretend to be one.  This camera is great at taking very nice pictures with minimal fuss.  If all you're interested in is turning the camera on and shooting, this is the camera for you.What I like:1) The zoom is manual, and is easier to set it right where you want then a motorized zoom.  There is no digital zoom, which is just as well.  You can digital zoom on your computer later.  My two other cameras have digital zoom tied to the motorized zoom controller.  I frequently accidentally get into digital zoom mode on those while shooting.  It's a real annoyance.2) The lens is high quality, and I can find no discoloration or distortion anywhere when using it.  But then, a Pro might.3) The screen and viewfinder display high quality images.4) The built in flash works pretty well.  The camera attempts to control the brightness of the flash, and does a decent job.  I have a similar Camera by Canon, and the built in flash is just too over-powering.What I don't like:1) The screen is hard to see outside during the day.  The brightness adjustment helps some, but not enough.2) The viewfinder has no rubber hood, and is also difficult to use out in the Sun.  I've had to use my left hand to shade the Sun, which makes the camera unstable trying to hold and shoot with only one hand.3) The playback button is placed in such a way that it's easy to touch it while shooting and inadvertently switch to playback as you're taking a photo.  But this is happening less and less as my mind learns to avoid it.4) No printed manual.  I hate PDF manuals.My opinion is that this camera really gives a lot of bang for the buck.  You can just set it to auto and take nice photos, or you can tinker with every adjustment to your heart's content.  The real selling point of this camera (IMHO) is the lens.  It does the work of 2 or 3 lenses on a DSLR, and it does it very well.At the top of this page I posted two photos.  They are of a Pelican, one at wide angle and one at full 30X zoom.  They give a good demonstration of the lens.", "I've recommended this camera to a half dozen people since I got it. What I needed from a camera was on that I could get good pictures of birds with while out hiking with my family. With the 30x zoom of this camera, no problem. I can zoom in on birds without scaring or startling them. It's compact enough that it fits into aLowepro Adventura 140 Camera Casefor me to carry while I'm out.It's well built and feels substantial, the auto-focus works fairly quickly or has for me so far.I'm using high capacity NiMH rechargeable batteries with it, and the battery life has been fairly good. I keep an extra charged set on hand when out taking pictures.I also needed a camera that would take good close up shots of beadwork and other crafts. This focuses in very well close up to everything I've tried it on so far.What I wanted was a camera I could grow into. One that I could use straight out of the box for the things above, and still could use to learn more about photography with. I got that too. I'm slowly learning a lot more about photography by switching modes from auto-focus to being able to adjust just one thing at a time and practicing. It is hybrid enough that it can be used in auto-focus mode by people used to point and shoots with a lot more capability than a standard point and shoots and still has enough very real features to let you learn all those neat photography tricks people do with DSLRs.I have small hands, and so far that hasn't been a problem. There is a full manual available, I'm not sure if it's on the cd that came with the camera since I downloaded it from the Fujifilm site before getting my camera. It uses standard sd card memory, so with a card reader you can just pull pictures off very easily.Just a fantastic camera.", "I've been on the fence for the last eight months considering this review and this camera and I've been seriously been putting it through its paces the whole time though. There's a lot of reviews that talk about more detailed specifics if you're looking for a critique on every aspect of this camera, but I'll spare you and just focus on what I found to be most important.First, this is an incredible piece of equipment in the totality of the package. The pictures that it takes - if you know what you're doing and you spend some time experimenting with this camera and messing with the settings, are very nice and impressive. The range of presets are quite elaborate but honestly meant to satiate the consumer and not the professional. If you know what you're doing, you'll likely steer clear of them and use manual, but they're good for using them on the fly and if you have little experience. This is an easy camera to master.The video it takes is also quite good and stands up quite well on its own as it is HD. However, because of the fixed lens and the lack of control of the video, you cannot compare the video quality to what you might get from a higher end Canon or a Canon in the same price bracket. I'm not comparing this to a higher end camera myself, but the maker had intended this camera, with on board video to be at least a runner-up, if not a competitor to the new trend of hand held cameras being able to support video.One of the most attractive qualities about this camera though is the Zoom lens. The ability of a fixed lens being able to do what this camera does, maintain a sharp image and handle stability is really impressive. The size of the camera and the compact stubby nature seems to lend this device to be used if you're going to try and conceal yourself if you catch my meaning. With a 30 times zooom, I can't see what else something like that would be used for. It's very effective and delivers solid images from a very long distance. I've added two pics in the images above which were taken almost simultaneously. All I did was zoom out.However ...The biggest downfall of this though, and I'm surprised no one has really touched on it, is the battery life. For the record, the Manufacturer decided to use four regular AA batteries as a power source instead of a standard OEM style battery like Canon or Nikon typically use. I researched this to see if these was a new trend in camera development and sad to say - it just isn't. I couldn't believe the amount of power consumption this camera eats up with as many batteries as it requires to operate. But the reality is, at the end of the day - this isn't really a camera - It's a computer dressed up as a camera and that's going to require a lot of power.Typically, I can get about 450-600 shots from an OEM battery with my Canon 20D and about 325-375 from the battery in my Canon Powershot. With this, and 4 AA batteries, I was able to only manage just under 250 single shots. I usually take an extra battery or two in my camera bag if I think I'm going to take that many, and I often do. In this case, even just doing headshots, I'm forced to carry around a 20 pack of batteries and that's an added cost and a bit of a pain. With video, I consistently was getting around 35-38 minutes of footage before having to change out. I have nothing to compare that to in that price range, so it's just something to consider.I found the poor energy conservation with this device a real achilles heel and if I was on the fence about buying this camera, I probably wouldn't as I don't think that the tech and ability of this camera warrant such a sacrifice. Also, Fuji will probably release a newer version of this camera, if they already haven't, that has better battery capability or even an OEM battery.I was perplexed at who made the decision to go with AA's on this and I just can't wrap my head around it. Even using the more expensive, longer lasting AA's, I still wasn't satisfied because the benefit doesn't outwiegh the cost - at least not yet. I'd say back to the drawing board with the battery power on this one.If the power issue doesn't bother you, you'll likely love the results you get from this and be nominally happy with the onboard HD video....", "\"I haven't had the camera for very long, but I've taken about 200 photos with it and I have to say that I'm really impressed with the image quality. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good \"\"bridge\"\" camera. I just hope it lasts as I'm getting tired of returning things on Amazon!\"", "The instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired.Jpegs are superb. RAW images show considerable distortion if you process them in anything other than the RAW File Converter application that is supposed to be supplied on the CD that comes with the camera, but wasn't. At least it wasn't if you're looking for the Mac version. I had to find and download the thing on my own. While it corrects the lens distortion, in all other respects, it is a mediocre RAW processor. The camera itself is really slow in saving RAW images. Ultimately, I decided to shoot 90% jpegs, and for the 10% RAW images I shoot, I process them initially through Fuji's RAW File Converter into 16 bit TIFFs, saving with the default settings (except maybe White Balance) and open those TIFFs in Adobe Camera Raw prior to running them through Photoshop if necessary.That being said, the camera is reasonably light and sturdy. Auto focus is excellent, which is good, because the manual focus ring is clunky at best. All of the settings you are likely to need quick access to are accessible from buttons on the back or top of the camera. This is really nice. The lens is exceptional (after software correction) for a camera in this or any other price range. The manual zoom is a zillion times better than any motorized zoom out there. Very easy to use. Auto exposure resists the urge to overexpose the highlights as most inexpensive cameras do. This makes the two full auto modes pretty useful. But switching to shutter or aperture priority (or full manual) is trivial. Lens stabilization is just flat unbelievable. Very sharp images even when handheld and zoomed all the way out with decent light. Most of the special features that they push in the advertising and that you don't find on other cameras are pretty clunky and useless, but as a lightweight camera to take on long hikes through difficult terrain (which is mostly what I do) I find this to be an excellent alternative to a DSLR with a bunch of difficult to cary lenses.Overall, I'm finding this a very flexible and easy to use camera for my needs. Image quality is surprisingly good. I'm much happier with this camera than I expected to be, and I expected to be pretty happy.", "I preordered this months before its release - tons of PR yet no sample images until the last minute. Now we know why - the JPG quality is mush - the resolving power of that 30X lens is no better than my panasonic FZ35 at 18X.So, I like the lens, but I HATE the EVF, the long shot-to-shot times, the very long burst photo write times. The camera is just very slow, period.To set up the much-celebrated 7-shots a second burst shots, it requires no less than 7 clicks to get this far, and the burst is over in less than one second. You do not choose the time, only the # shots in that second. If you need to cover a 5 second event, you are out of luck. As a action shooter, this camera is not a good choice.The video is nice, but you will wince when trying to manually zoom that lens while filming! Jerky at best.Finally, the batteries will drive you nuts.Do what I did and avoid this entire generation - go out and buy a superzoom like the FZ-35. It isn't 30X, but it is more fun.I may buy the HS-20, but wish I had avoided the HS10."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[6.194939487613738e-05, 0.0007776744896546006, 0.0013620855752378702, 0.13747671246528625, 0.0047314586117863655, 0.009970084764063358, 6.155822484288365e-05, 0.07652445882558823, 0.0006133177084848285, 0.004297870676964521, 0.1455487310886383, 0.0006037650746293366, 9.717306238599122e-05, 0.11398966610431671, 0.006474809255450964, 0.00021778773225378245, 0.0030837245285511017, 0.006894629914313555, 0.029378172010183334, 0.007668128702789545, 0.00011172435188200325, 0.0035720248706638813, 0.20681658387184143, 0.1572396457195282, 0.08118370920419693, 0.001242645550519228]]}
