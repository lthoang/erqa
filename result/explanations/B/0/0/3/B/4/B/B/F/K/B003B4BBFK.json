The design is pretty 'tinny', kind of cheap feeling, and the middle mouse wheel and button are pretty low quality feeling, but for the price you can't beat it.", "Nice mouse for the price. I needed a new one after the Microsoft one I had died after just a couple months. I've always had luck with Logitech items so decided to give this one a spin.", "I am very particular about my mice. This particular mouse's shape I find pleases me.", "This works perfect and is very low priced.  I couldn't find a USB mouse at the store.  They are all wireless and require batteries that run out.  This mouse works perfectly and never needs batteries.  And is half the cost of a wireless mouse.", "This inexpensive mouse is just the ticket. Experienced puter people use a basic mouse so it can do its simple mousey job. No frills needed. Yet, it IS a three-button mouse. The scroll wheel is the third.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT1. The optical sensor works on just about any surface I have tried it on, as I use it for my laptop.2. Handsome, sleek, understated appearance3. 1000 dpi; adequate for serious gaming.4. Comfortable to use for hours.5. The buttons are neither over-sensitive nor under-sensitive...just right.6. The scroll wheel is very responsive and quiet. A reviewer here said the wheel is loud when used...nonsense.7. Plug and Play: Insert the USB plug into the puter, the icon says it is installing drivers, wait a minute...ready to go.8. Designed for ambidextrous use.9. Made by Logitech means quality build.10. The $11.00 price is right.WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT IT1. The very long cord...unnecessarily long. Why would anyone EVER need a six-foot long mouse cord? So I have coiled the sucker using one of those black electrical twist ties to manage the long, thin, black snakelike mouse tail. Sorry, for this blunder it loses a star, otherwise it earns 4.5 stars.SUMMARYLogitech almost got everything right here...both function and price. Thanks Logitech. But please, just weasel chisel us on cord length. Recommended.I hope this was helpful to you. If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.________________________________________________________________________________________________________MY BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com", "Great for medium-sized hands - at an unbeatable price.  A quality product.  The increased resolution (from 800 to 1,000 dpi) is noticeably smoother, especially in starting from a stop for some reason.I LOVE it.", "These worked great and I got them for backups when the wireless mice go dead and I do not have a battery.Shipping was quick and will do again!", "So far Logitech always provides a simple, economical solution for me..I stay with Logitech mice, and so far so good.", "This particular mouse, small in size and easy to manipulate. Logitech consistently offers quality  products for a reasonable cost. Bravo!", "The Good:It's inexpensive, not cheapGood laser tracking on a variety of surfacesLasts forever in a daily use office environmentIt has a cordThe Bad:If you need a 1200 dpi mouse for gaming, this is not itIf you need more than L/M/R+scroll, this is not the mouse to getIt has a cord", "This is a simple mouse that works great.  We use them at our business for replacements.  I will buy more when we need them.", "I decided I wanted a cheap little mouse to use with my chromebook and this fit the criteria. I wouldn't use it for my desktop as it's not a particularly nice mouse, but it's cheap and it works and that's all I really wanted.", "I got this for my mother, to go with her new laptop. On the plus side, it is ideal for the sort of user she is: short periods of use and no need for fancy features. That is, this is a basic, no frills mouse that does what a mouse needs to do. I elected to go with the corded version so my mother would not need to replace batteries or deal with the occasional connection issues that arise with such mice.If you are a heavy mouse user or a serious gamer, this is not the mouse for you. But, if you are looking for an adequate mouse for basic use, this is a decent mouse at a great price.", "Plugged this right into my new Acer tablet and it fired right up without a lot of installation hassle...strictly plug and play...can't beat it and will probably buy a couple more for other portables.", "I don't remember if I wrote a review for this, I probably did, and I probably wrote a good review tooSince then I had to buy a second mouse because the first mouse was having issues. The left click would be stuck, and die sometimes. The red light on the bottom would go on and off. Then the left button was also stuck.The second time, it would just double click and you know what's strange? My cursor was moving for NO REASON. I watched the arrow move slowly, back and forth. So TWO issues going on with the same mouse.This mouse only works for a year or less. I was thinking of just buying the same mouse again but you know what, I am not going to bother. I will just get the same problem again. I am not the only one having the same issues either.When it does work, it's perfectly fine and affordable. But twice I've had problems with this SAME mouse. It does not last long either. I swear it lasts only a year or so. I guess I do get my money's worth...", "My computer positioning does not allow a direct view of the mouse and so remote mice are not an option for me.  This wired mouse works quite well and the long cord allows it to be snaked under and around obstacles.  Unlike remote mice, the tracking is smooth and not jerky.The price was very good and it functions as advertised.I would recommend this mouse to others with MHz and line-of-sight issues.", "It worked as well as any other mouse and it was nicely shaped in my hand but after a few months my computer is completely on and off with recognizing it. I like the USB. Compared to my USB drive, which is oddly fat, it takes a normal amount of room which is always something to consider. I didn't treat it that well, though, so it was partially my fault.", "I have tried a number of cordless products.  I have come back to this model.  It works well and is comfortable to use.  Best of all...no batteries needed!", "I don't demand a lot from mice. Just the basics: moving the pointer, a scroll wheel, 3 buttons (pressing the wheel is the third button) and operation on almost any color surface. This mouse does it all perfectly and reliably.The symmetric design makes this a good choice for use with either hand.Update: Feb 6, 2014The Logitech M100 is a inexpensive but dependable, well made and basic wired mouse. Mine is still going strong after years of use. I appreciate the simplicity while it does everything I need quite well.", "Not really much more to  say than the title. My old mouse I was using with my MacBookPro quit. I bought a Belkin replacement which was junk (I'll leave a review on that as well). Then I went for the good ol' Logitech mouse. It's big, but that's fine. At least it works well.", "I live and eat at my computer for several hours per day.  Cleaning the track ball was a recurring task.  I haven't had to clean any of the 4 Logitechs that I have (one for each computer).  You do need to have a surface for the optical pickup to read."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.014638693071901798, 0.019921865314245224, 0.10177360475063324, 0.011328698135912418, 6.226086406968534e-05, 0.004133855924010277, 0.08421456068754196, 0.07737687975168228, 0.001987315248697996, 0.008797840215265751, 0.10921239852905273, 0.04866679385304451, 0.12195540964603424, 0.03771763667464256, 0.02382718212902546, 0.05556788295507431, 0.04744108021259308, 0.0930400863289833, 0.013398888520896435, 0.006969815120100975, 0.11796722561120987]]}
