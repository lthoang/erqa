It has a strange heft to it that makes you think its not going to work, but it does.", "The product arrived on time. I wanted to cut my standard sim card to a Macro sim card size for my nexus 4. I placed my sim card on the right place and tried to cut the sim.. Amazing, the handle bent and sim cutter became useless!! Fortunately the sim card did not break but left impressions on it and I used scissors to get the job done, I had  watched a lot of videos on the this product before using it so I believe it was not my mistake, but I had used this for the first time..", "i've used this punch countless times and it's still going strong.  very well made like a good stapler.as other reviews say, the included adapters are useless.  not docking any stars because the punch is well made.", "\"Decided to purchase a new unlocked GSM phone very soon that requires a micro sim card. And I hated having to change from the tried and true standard MINI Sims to the Micro Sims, however, the micro sim cards are becoming more and more \"\"standard\"\" sim card on the newer phones these days. Yet now I have some superb phones with MINI (standard) sim slots. What to do? The answers are simple: Get the cutter and several adapters (get only good quality adapters, I found the ones here are just SO SO for me but since the cutter is so so perfect, I still give it 5 stars).*******Very important information for you to know about MINI (Standard) Sim Cards:--There are TWO kinds of Standard Sim cards out there in every brand:1) The newer style of sim--the best kind to cut. Why? Because the gold foil area is smaller and there is blank space on the edge of the card so when it is cut, you STILL have ALL the gold foil area and the new MICRO sim will work.2) The OLDER style of sim--The worst type to try to cut. Why? Because the gold foil are is much larger than the new Sims and the gold foil area totally covers one of the edges you will cut (I know as I tried this)! So when it is cut, some of the FOIL part is cut and then the new MICRO card may not work. What to do if you have that kind. Before you ruin the sim, take it to your phone store AT&T;, T-Mobile, etc and tell them you need to have your sim data transferred from the old MINI sim to a Micro sim. This is not that uncommon and it should not be a problem.STEPS for cutting the card to Micro and placing the MICRO into an adapter:1) Get a good quality cutter to turn in an existing activated MINI card into a \"\"new\"\" MICRO Card!2) Then learn how to insert the MICRO Sim into the \"\"Adapter\"\".Before I even attempted doing this, I already had some older type of MINI SIM cards (non actvitated, just for testing out phones, etc). So I practiced and I cut with this cutter per instructions (firmly pressing down in one fast swoop). Presto! Perect cut! Now I have a \"\"practice\"\" MICRO sim card and placed it into the adapter. (I am picky about adapters, so I had already had some others on had that I like better with the ones included in this package).3) Now that I cut out the \"\"new\"\" MICRO sims (I did this with AT&T;, T-Mobile, Simple Mobile) and tried them all out in my favorite adapters and placed them in my Samsung Galaxy S2 and a couple of standard sim slots in other phones).4) Putting the Micro into the Adapter: Line up the MICRO into the center and gently press down with your thumb. If you listen, you should hear a very low \"\"click\"\" I kept gently pressing to make sure the micro was totally in.When inserting the ADAPTER/Micro into an older phone:Be sure to touch just the outer edges of the Adapter (Do not press the center micro as it will fall out). Start from the end of the adapter and quickly push it in. Don't worry if the first \"\"practice\"\" time or two, the inside micro card pops out. I had to \"\"practice\"\" several times and realized that if I only touch the edges of the adapter and NEVER the micro sim, and then press down fast, all went perfectly. Some older phones are easier to place an adapter sim set into then others. And it gets better with time. Also, I have plenty of extra adapters so that with time, I can still use my older phones in an emergency if I have to. On to the MICRO Sims, on to the future!\"", "I use this recently to cut a SIM card from a Galaxy Note to fit into my iPhone 4, the cutter worked great!  I aligned the gold so I could see it and once I was sure I just squeezed hard and it popped out.  I did have to sand the sides a little bit to make it smooth and fit in the iPhone 4 tray fine, but that was easy with a piece of sand paper (do not sand too hard, these SIM cards are very weak and a little sanding goes a long way).I needed to switch back to my Galaxy Note for a moment, and put the Mico SIM in the adapter and slid it into the Galaxy Note, it worked and I could use the Note, but when I was done and needed to switch back to the iPhone 4 (just needed to activate the Galaxy Note on a network), I pulled the card out and it would not come out!  I finally was able to get tweezers to grab the plastic (which is a tad fat compared to a regular SIM card) and got the adapter and Micro SIM out of the Galaxy Note, but it pulled up on of the connectors!!!  Luckily the connector was not damaged and I was able to push it down (you can still see that it is higher than the rest), I put in a deactivated SIM card and the Galaxy Note still worked, but this was too close!  I threw the adapters in the trash!In the end this SIM Cutter worked great and was a great price, I would not try to bother with the adapters, unless your phone uses an old Nokia like tray (where you lift a grate and lay the SIM on it and than the grate snaps in place), if your phone has a slide in SIM, I would not even try!!!  I would still recommend this for the SIM cutter but not the converters!!!!", "\"Looks like it does not match the chip on my SIM-card - the chip border is out of the cut \"\"window\"\".\"", "This is one of those 'nice to have' devices provided you use it more than twice in a year. It's well-made and does what it's designed to do.", "Cutter worked great the first time but all the subsequent cuts had rough edges which had to be shaved off. The included SIM adapters are of very bad quality and won't keep your micro-sim snapped in. If you only intend to use this once then you're all set but if you get this to snap all your family's SIMs then better look elsewhere.", "It worked just as advertised.A little nervous when I pushed down and heard the crunch.But plugged it into my new Galaxy Note 3 and it worked correctly.", "I needed to repair the clips on some of my network cables. Instead of buying and running new wires in my basement I bought this crimper and some connectors. If your new at this like I was, just go to you-tube and watch a few videos on how to put the connectors on your cables. With a little practice, I was a pro. The price of this tool was very low so I was worried it would be of poor quality, but it was nice and heavy and did a great job of crimping the connectors.", "It did 95% of the work but I would expect a tool like this to do the job 100% and not leave me having to clean up the edges before I can use the card.The two adapters that come with the card were of no use putting the SIM back into a Nokia handset. I wound up using the remnant of the original SIM to put the card back into a full size SIM slot.", "I bought my mother theNokia Lumia 520here on Amazon when it was a Gold Box deal as a phone upgrade for Christmas.  I didn't feel like going into the AT&T; store and dealing with data plans or anything like that so I bought thisSIM Card Cutterso I could cut down her regular SIM into a micro SIM to fit the new phone.  This cutter actually worked perfectly.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and looked through the window instead of using the guide.  The cut was perfect and fit in the new phone like a glove.  The two SIM adapters included in this package aren't that bad.  If you don't remove your SIM from your phone too often, you won't have a problem using them.  They fit and work well for moving the SIM back to the old phone, in case of emergencies.", "The Mico SIM Cutter is of high quality and works very easily.  But, having cut two SIMs for my iPhone 4S, the finished product (the reduced size SIM) is a little tight for the iPhone SIM tray.  It works, but you have to push it in, as compared to the SIM that comes with the iPhone 4.", "I bought my cutter from the Marketplace seller Platinum Galaxy, and got the item as-pictured.Cutting the SIM was a total breeze. Seriously, you'd have to try to screw up your SIM with this tool, in order to wind up with something you couldn't use.The included adapters were razor thin, but still just a touch too thick for my Galaxy Nexus. However, the full-sized SIM that I popped with the tool was all I needed, as far as adapters go.", "First off, this is a handy tool. You don't have to be an engineer to figure it out, but you do have to do one thing: Line up the sim card with the hole. Ensure you don't cut the gold back or your sim will be done. Get that right, and you're good to go! My sim from my iPhone 3G cut down perfectly to fit in my new 4S. The adapters are nice, but you have to kind of wiggle it into the sim slot.", "I bought this mainly for the sim cutter. Absolutely no complaints where that is concerned, just pop in your sim, press down HARD and swift and voila - neat micro sim. The only reason I didn't rate higher is that I didn't receive the sim adaptors in my package, so unable to comment on those. Supplier was very helpful however, great customer service in that they offered to ship a replacement immediately or give a refund. I only needed the cutter actually so not a big deal for me.", "Converted my prepay T Mobile card to iPhone 4, without any problems.  Easy to use, and it comes with sim holders in case you want to go back (to the precut size).", "I bought this to cut a T-Mobile sim card for an iPhone. I only used it once, but it did the job perfectly. Very easy to use and beats trying to cut the sim card with a pr of scissors", "I got it very cheap when they first released the iphone 4 with the mini sim. I used it to cut at least 20 sim cards (all the family used it) especially when the samsung S3 was also released with the mini Sim card. It still working just fine. The adapters coming with it are very thick though! but you can still use the cut part again for original size SIM.", "By far this is the worst you can get, the seller send me a cutter with no brand although the web page and the picture says Noosy, also the cutter was  a used one and came with damaged package,and missing an adapter. Stay a way from this seller.", "\"Amazon's customer service is awesome.  The actual product is not.Amazon's website advertised this product as a \"\"by Noosy\"\" brand SIM cutter with 2 SIM adapters.What I received was a low quality, generic cutter in a half-torn plastic bag with a stapled opening -- and missing the 2 SIM adapters.  I'm not so sure I'd trust using something of such low quality to cut a sim that will go into my expensive iPad or iPhone.Luckily for me, Amazon refunded me the purchase price for the actual vendor's error.\"", "I do not recommend using the adapters as they are like a hair's-thickness thicker than a standard SIM card.Rather I used the original SIM card as the adapter. What I mean is When I cut out my Micro SIM from the Original SIM, I used the Original SIM as the adapter to fit the Micro SIM. And It still works! :DBuild Quality of the Cutter is excellent, though it cut off a little bit of the Gold plating off the Edge of the core of the SIM card. This did not affect performance, at least I did not notice any.I bought this compared to other competitors as this product was fulfilled by Amazon and based on previous buyers of this product."], "Gamma": [0.3333333432674408, 0.3333333432674408, 0.3333333432674408], "Beta": [[0.13204185664653778, 0.08591191470623016, 0.005802076309919357, 0.0016509899869561195, 0.002484953496605158, 0.12225533276796341, 0.07201972603797913, 0.004589723888784647, 0.11370105296373367, 0.012483182363212109, 0.14314690232276917, 0.0001893627631943673, 0.00024167055380530655, 0.0007529098656959832, 0.0030010344926267862, 0.0034650268498808146, 0.09367042034864426, 0.10593757778406143, 0.006355689838528633, 0.08933869749307632, 0.0007872805581428111, 0.00017267452494706959], [0.13204185664653778, 0.08591191470623016, 0.005802076309919357, 0.0016509899869561195, 0.002484953496605158, 0.12225533276796341, 0.07201972603797913, 0.004589723888784647, 0.11370105296373367, 0.012483182363212109, 0.14314690232276917, 0.0001893627631943673, 0.00024167055380530655, 0.0007529098656959832, 0.0030010344926267862, 0.0034650268498808146, 0.09367042034864426, 0.10593757778406143, 0.006355689838528633, 0.08933869749307632, 0.0007872805581428111, 0.00017267452494706959], [0.1320418417453766, 0.08591192960739136, 0.005802076775580645, 0.0016509905690327287, 0.002484953263774514, 0.12225531041622162, 0.07201973348855972, 0.004589724820107222, 0.11370103806257248, 0.012483182363212109, 0.14314688742160797, 0.00018936274864245206, 0.0002416707284282893, 0.0007529097492806613, 0.003001035423949361, 0.003465027781203389, 0.09367043524980545, 0.10593756288290024, 0.00635569030418992, 0.08933868259191513, 0.0007872809073887765, 0.00017267461225856096]]}
