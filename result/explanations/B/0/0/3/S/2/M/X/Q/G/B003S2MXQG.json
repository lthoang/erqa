I have never heard of the Warhammer universe, so its setting is very novel to me- this is a sci-fi, intergalactic romp. But what makes it odd is that your enemies consist of an orc horde, summoning fantasy worlds to mind, particularly The Lord of the Rings. Where this game really shines is in the fun of pure, melee combat- cutting loose against the vast quantities of orcs that are bent upon your destruction. This reminded me strongly of \"\"The Return of the King\"\" for Xbox and PS2, a game that I loved and played several times through.Developer THQ did a great job with nailing the camera and character movement, creating a tight experience. Combat against your orc foes (the bulk of the game) is fast, visceral, and fun, with a well balanced mix of melee and ranged weapons. It must also be mentioned that the intro/tutorial/first level is masterfully executed, as you drop into the midst of a battle upon a ship.A cover system (I can't believe that's missing) and some sort of leveling process would have been welcome additions. The graphics aren't quite up to snuff with the indsutry's darlings of 3rd person games (Uncharted and Gears), but they are very competent, particularly with regard to how many enemies converge on the screen at one time. All in all, this is a fun, easy to pick up game that's very enjoyable in short bursts.\"", "Space Marine is about as simplistic as current generation games get. As Captain Titus (Mark Strong, the narrator of Who Do You Think You Are?) all you really do is go forward and shoot/duel, and it's a long game with nothing much sustain the many miles of bad road. For a 3rd person shooter it's basic stuff. Set on a distant planet filled with Orks it is your duty to wipe them all out. The levels/chapters are very slow, with huge, cavernous empty spaces and bombed-out buildings that offer no interaction other than occasionally opening a door or elevator. Half of each chapter will involve you doing nothing but moving forward.If it were not for the Warhammer brand name this game would be the very definition of shovelware. I played it right to the end, unlocking 34% of the trophies, but to get the platinum you'd literally have to spend over 100 hours playing this game. Quite frankly, I don't want to know anybody who commits that amount of time to a video game, or indoor activities in general.Graphics BSound BGameplay CLasting Appeal C-", "\"This happens to be the first game I've owned of the Warhammer 40k franchise, so when it comes to the lore, I am pretty much in the dark.  I know War40k is an RTS game and Table-Top game, but it seems that Warhammer40k has come a long way, now spreading out into the action/shooter genre.  Does this Space Marine have what it takes to survive the battle?  Well let's find out!GAMEPLAYWarhammer40k: Space Marines (War40k from this point on), is a game that hits you with action the moment you start it up.  There is very little in the way of downtime besides occasional dialog segments, or transitions into new areas.  Right off the bat you will be fighting through masses of Orks to reach your object, picking up a variety of weapons along the way(gun and melee) as well as upgrades for these weapons.The gameplay is very simplistic in War40k, almost too simple at times.  You have the ability for ranged attacks using guns, and up close melee attacks with a variety of weapons that you can find throughout the campaign.  When enemies get to close you can switch on the fly to your melee weapon of choice and start hacking away.  Mix in your \"\"stun\"\" attack occasionally to initiate a variety of stun moves(single target, or AoE).  When an enemy is stunned you can initiate a fatality move which produces plenty of blood, a nice death kill animation, as well as granting you health.  An interesting, and refreshing way to regenerate your health I think.Not all is good with this setup though.  While the gameplay is fun, there is little variety to it.  Within 3-4 hours you will begin to notice that despite a change of melee weapon or switching between guns; you really don't have as much freedom as one might think.  Combat is repetitive, though satisfying.  Another problem is the lack of a cover system.  Taking heavy fire?  Only thing you can do is walk behind cover and stand there until it is clear to strafe out.  If anything the lack of a cover system  hurts the shooting element of the game since intense firefights turn into scrambles to walk behind a box that is as tall as you. Overall the gameplay is enjoyable yet repetitive, but not repetitive enough to turn you off to the game.GRAPHICSGraphically this game looks alright.  There isn't much in the way of impressive visuals, other than those nice gory fatality moves, but it doesn't really impact the game at all.  No frame rate problems or oddities, though it was funny seeing mobs occasionally explode and instantly vanish upon death, rather than a corpse dropping to the ground for a second or two.  I'm sure this was done because of the vast # of orks that show up on the screen sometimes.  Overall the game is not all that graphically impressive but it does enough to make the trip enjoyable.SOUND/STORYVoice acting I found to be pretty good.  There was clearly some good effort put into the voices of the characters and logs you find, plus the Orks sound really awesome I think.  They remind me a little of the Lord of the Rings Uruk Hai sometimes.  Weapon effects sound satisfying and have a good punch to them.  As for the storyline, it is honestly hard for me to truly comment on.  Being my first Warhammer40k title, it feels like being tossed into season 5 of a 10 season Drama on TV.  After a while you pick up the gist of things yet still feel a bit confused.  The story flushes out well, and deals with your character, Captain Titus, leading an assault to prevent an Ork invasion from stealing a Battle Titan.REPLAY/LENGTHWar40k will be at least a good 8-10 hour adventure.  The game is broken up into 17 chapters spread out amongst 5 parts.  Throw in hidden logs, multiplayer and Co-Op(see below) fans of the genre and gameplay style will have plenty to keep themselves occupied with.** CO-OP will be added about a month after launch and will be free to those who purchase the game (activate their MP pass). From the looks of it, the Co-Op being given out is going to be similar to a horde mode for up to 5 players.OVERALL 82% (8.2 / B-)War40k is a good game.  It isn't a great game, nor does it try to be a great game.  It does exactly what it was intending to do, and that is bring the Warhammer40k universe into a new genre of game.  For a first crack at a shooter/hack and slash action game; Relic did a pretty good job I think.  While all the elements included in War40k are not 5 star material, they come together nicely making for an enjoyable game that even a noob to the Warhammer franchise (like myself) will have no major problems figuring out what is going on.Despite some repetitive gameplay; a simple yet fun Multi-player element and the addition of some form of Co-Op, free of charge, help boost War40k into being a game that is worth the purchase if you are a fan of the genre or gameplay style.  Repetitive gameplay aside, it can be a lot of fun tearing up waves of orks!  4 stars!**NOTE: Co-Op will be included in an update slated for October 25th.  It will contain 2 maps..  4 player Co-Op... where you will battle against Ork's or Chaos.**NOTE: 9/22 Patch released to resolve MP problems for PS3 users.  Matchmaking and lag problems have been resolved (finally!)\"", "\"OK, so, I purchased this game \"\"USED\"\", and must admit, for the $25.00 I paid.....It's WELL WORTH the money spent! Having a blast playing the game! I'm gonna just jump right in with the review:PROS:> Cool game, extreme blood & gore, halfway decent fighting platform.> Very nice graphics (easily a 7 out of 10)> Challenging, but, not insanely hard.> Tons of cool weapons to pick from, ammo is easy to find> God/Extreme Mode: Which lasts for around 15-20 seconds when you use L3 & R3 buttons> Overall: A lot of fun to play!CONS:There's not that many, really...I know it looks like I'm writing a lot of complaints, but, I'm kind just being a bit nit-picky....> One of my major complaints is the camera angles during fighting sequences....pretty annoying! Not horrible, but, could have / should have been done differently, in my opinion.> Orcs have an EXTREMELY LIMITED vocabulary! They basically only say 2 things... \"\"Kill the Space Marine\"\", and \"\"Space Marine\"\"....OK, and maybe a moan or groan when they die.....BUT....TWO PHRASES???? COME ON???? REALLY!!!! THAT really gets annoying!!! Especially when you have to kill literally THOUSANDS of Orcs throughout this game, and you hear the SAME 2 phrases OVER & OVER & OVER AGAIN!!!  Jeeesh!!!  Would it have been so hard for HAVOC to be a bit more creative on the Orc dialogue??? Just 2 more dumb phrases would have been much better, and easier on the ears!> Overall Gameplay: Now, this is the weird thing.....Even playing on EASY mode, you might find yourself throwing the controller a few times. While it's not an extremely hard game to play or master (overall), I must warn you, there are some parts of the game that are just pure insanity. And this is even on the EASY MODE! You'll find yourself dying like 12 times just trying to get past one part, while sailing through other areas in 5 minutes flat?????....makes no sense...but...whatever??? Some parts of the EASY MODE actually feel like you're playing on HARD MODE...> And this brings me to the final Complaint: \"\"Health\"\"......The health meter is OK, but my gripe is if you're in a huge fight, taking on 30 Orcs at a time, you need to do a Finishing Move to gain health...OK, no big deal.... but, while you're right smack in the middle of doing a finishing move to gain more health, you'll die, because 80 more Orcs are slammin' you all at the same time.....Kind of annoying, but, I can deal with it.Overall, it's a really fun game, with tons of gore, a bit challenging, but, the limited vocabulary of the Orcs gets a bit old, really fast.  :)  BUT, if you can grab yourself a \"\"used\"\" game, it's really checking out. Hours of fun!\"", "game isn't horrible, but isn't really fun either.  Maybe I just am not a huge Warhammer fan, but i thought i could still enjoy it just for the ...you know...giant chainsaw swords and guns and what not.  Just, isn't fun, its hard to say anything more than that.  Single player is...just completely boring story line, land on planet, kill orcs....no memorable characters, no dialogue or anything in the story worth repeating.  Online is death match.  ......yep.", "This is a game about blowing stuff away and bringing the hammer down (literaly!).Unfortunately that is about it. Shoot orcs, smash orcs, shoot orcs, and so on.On normal setting you can probably breeze through this game in a few days easy.But what kept me going is the feeling of basically being a walking tank. The weapons are huge, most/all the ammo blows up on impact.Orcs have huge heads so you can feel like a pro with all the headshots. LOLThe Fun:-Jetpack and Giant Hammer = Tons of Fun-Jetpack orcs trying to get on your ship, shoot em off!The Tiring:After about the 97th wave of orcs of foot...Slow walking... but I guess I should not complain, that armor looks waaaaay heavy.Bottom line, if you can get this for cheap and are a fan of Warhammer 40k it will be a fun ride.", "For fans of tabletop gaming, this game was probably a sort of triumph. Several concepts from the Warhammer franchise have filtered into popular culture but with this game, it becomes more evident where they originated.My ONLY complaint (and it's a big one) is that while this game plays like Xbox's &#34;Gears of War&#34;, it lacks cooperative play. That's a huge drawback in this instance that holds me back from a full five-stars.", "I bought this game last fall but just played it. Lots of Fun! MP was ok as well. This is a rip-roaring game. Heh, I see the price has really dropped. Anyway, I had a really good time with this game. Although there is no shotgun-type 1-hit gun, there is a lot of melee. I also like taking a shot with my gun when in melee. Fury, the power up attack, is very cool.Well, no need to review the whole game. I just wanted to say this is worth playing. I had a good time playing this game."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.054063521325588226, 0.21364355087280273, 0.31005963683128357, 0.013634530827403069, 0.030181553214788437, 0.01637052744626999, 0.18590132892131805, 0.1761452853679657]]}
