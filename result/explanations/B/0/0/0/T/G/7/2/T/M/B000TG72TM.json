I like the fact that the story has you playing different forces around the globe. The ending is very intense as well. Then, I realized that I really wanted to see what all the fuss was with the online play. I got one word for it......addictive. Online will just keep you playing over and over. Plus, it always gives you something to play for. For example, every kill that you get, there is a points system. As the points accumulate, you move up in rank. Not to mention, you get upgrades on weapons and weapons accessories. Now, in every match, you'll get killed. It's inevitable, but the point is to get as many kills as you can. Think you're good? You are not even as good as you think you are until you play online. You playing against the best all around the world. Still, it's all good fun. This game won game of the year. It definitely deserved.", "This game definitely lives up to all the hype.  My only complaint is that it is too short for the single campaign.  The game is definitely a must buy.  The levels are just well thought out and puts you in the middle of the action.", "COD 4 is agreat game. It's single player is awesome, well story. Gameplay is great also.Graphics are great, but still UNCHARTED looks a lot better.", "I usually keep my reviews short and sweet so I will do the same here.  If you like FPS games you simply MUST pick up COD4.  The visuals are stunning on PS3 and the gameplay is superb.  This plays and looks every bit as good as the 360 version, in fact I personally think it looks better on PS3.  Multiplayer online is super cool with all kinds of neat perks and level ups that really add enjoyment to the game.  So if you enjoy this type of game then I highly recommend you pick this up.", "\"Based on the other reviews you might think that this game is either great or horrible. I think it's actually a fun game to play and experience.The Single Player:The story is fun to play, yes it's missing that co-op option, but it's an interesting story that jumps from person to person's viewpoint with a couple of fun little encounters along the way.There is some leeway in playing (it is linear but you can stray a little from the parameters) but you have to remember some of the aspects are disturbing. Namely, sometimes you HAVE to hit a certain spot for the next part to advance (or automatically save). In other cases this certain spot will trigger the stop of the flow of endless enemies. This can be annoying because you have limited ammo and have to reach that \"\"checkpoint\"\" to stop the flow.The story can be completed in about two nights on \"\"Regular\"\"/Normal difficulty if you're like me and don't play straight through. So fairly short, but some fun missions to go back and try on \"\"Arcade.\"\" With the AC-130 Gunship and Ghillie suit missions being my personal faves.The Multiplayer:This may very well be the reason to get the game.I say this because of the many variants/options that can be exercised. The PERK system is a neat addition, allowing for you to customize the type of soldier you're sending out there.It may take a few games to unlock the other modes of gameplay, but once you do, you'll have plenty of options to pick from (not just Team Deathmatch and Free for All). The rank also unlocks weapons, perks, and challenges. The challenges allow for you to gain additional points (experience needed for rank) and are also fun to try and obtain. So many kills with a certain weapon, headshots w/ that weapon, etc. etc.It's true that the game does look good and plays well. Sometimes in multiplayer the connection is lost, but that is very rare. The Lobby for matchmaking can be frustrating at times trying to find an online game to join, but with a little patience it usually comes up with no problem and you're off in no time. (Update: with a recent update/patch to the game seems the wait time is even decreased for matchmaking)The Multiplayer portion is definitely the meat of this game. A shame that there aren't more maps, but the ones that they do have are pretty fun. A person can spend a LOT of time online.Try messing around with the \"\"Create a Class\"\" option, and set up a couple different profiles for you to pick from during an online game. This is where the choice of weapons and perks really comes in handy.For instance if you've unlocked the \"\"Dead Silence\"\" perk, you can couple that with a silencer on your weapon and the enemy won't see or hear you coming (until the UAV is enabled, but you can use the UAV Jamming perk to block it if you wish).Another really nice perk I'll mention-- just as another example-- is the \"\"Sleight of Hand\"\" for faster reloading times. This REALLY comes in handy for the LMGs that have a long reload time. But basically, customize your class the way you'd like. There are a lot of options once you've unlocked enough of the ranks to be able to utilize all the different weapons, weapon customizations, and perks.\"", "Well when I first got this game I went into it with high hopes and expectations due to the good things I had heard about the game. I simply was not in any way disappointed, the campaign mode and the online mode combine to make an excellent gaming experience.The campaign mode although short, is nothing short of un-eventful. From start to finish the game is non-stop action and intensity, the AI seems to be spot on this year with the enemy recognising your fire and acting accordingly. The story itself is quite an intense and thrilling setting which seems to fit in perfectly with the current feel of todays conflict.The online mode, now theres something to scream about, people will have you believe that peer to peer connections are a bad thing but I simply don't see the problem. Sure there are times when a host would simply end a game and admittedly it would become annoying, when you get into the gameplay however you simply come to forget about the lagging or problems that may appear on the rare occasions. The whole XP points in the gameplay that allow you to unlock extra weapons and perks are an extra initiative to have you enjoy the game further as you continuously play to complete your challenges and reach the next level. This rewards system would have some people complain as it is seen as unfair to the new players of the online game as they have a significant disadvantage. This I have to disagree with, if you're a new player to the game and there are a ton of people who have all the perks and all the best weapons this gives you a better learning curve as you become educated in how the game works and how to defeat those who have better guns than you.This is genuinely an extremely good game and one that should be a part of every PS3 owners game collection.", "\"COD4 - the latest and arguably best installment of the Call Of Duty series, is a proper game of two halves.ControlsCOD4 is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and if you've played something like Drake's Fortune, the controls are sufficiently similar that it becomes a zero-learning-curve game. (Note - Drake's Fortune uses third-person camera - yuk. COD4 is first-person - ie. you look through your own eyes).GraphicsThe graphics in COD4 are good. Very good. Not brilliant, but a massive step up from the previous titles. The environments are detailed but the maps are relatively small. There is good texture mapping and use of colour and the global shadowing system is adequate. There are some problems though. There is a lot of aliasing on thin lines - power lines, cables - stuff like that. Aliasing is the stair-step effect (jaggies) that you get when a graphics system is unable to smooth out the differences in extreme contrast. For a console as power as a PS3, this shouldn't be a problem but it is. COD4 also suffers a lot of popup - where items pop in to view very late or change level of detail very late. This is particularly noticable on the Ambush map in multiplayer mode. The bricks and debris on the ground pops in in front of you almost in a wave as you run. Sandbags pop to their highest right in front of you and the burned out tanks in the middle of the map pop into high detail as you approach them. To start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. Again - a PS3 shouldn't have this problem but COD4 is a multi-platform game so maybe they just coded to the lowest common denominator and didn't bother to tweak it for the PS3.Smoke and particle effects are nice, but very processor-intensive. If someone pops a smoke grenade and you run through the smoke cloud, be prepared for very low framerates - it really bogs down. You'll see the same three or four textures used on smoke billowing through the smoke effects too so if you're waiting it out for the smoke to clear, you'll think \"\"hey - deja vu - I just saw that exact same smoke.\"\"There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.Occasionally you'll find faults in the graphics engine that make you wonder if the game didn't QA properly. On the Pipeline map for example, you can hop on to one of the oil tank rail cars and see through the oil tank. Sometimes when you die you'll fall out of the map or be able to see the inside of your character's head. The game runs at 60Hz for the most part, and in 720p it looks pretty good (but it's not full HD). There are places where it'll bring the PS3 to its knees though with the number of characters and effects all being drawn at once. Multiplayer mode on the Shipment and WetWork maps are good examples. You'll be lucky to ever see 60 frames per second on those maps.Motion capture is good but not brilliant. All the requisite moves are there for all the characters but there are some noticable pops and bangs in between their set pieces. If you're in the thick of the action, you don't notice it so much but if you're spectating a multiplayer game, or observing enemies through a scope in the single player game, you'll often see a glitch in the motion capture between crouching and standing up. There's a definite pop as the characters go from slow, hunched-down crawl to normal walking when standing up. There are other issues here and there but the crouch-to-stand-up problem is the one that immediately springs to mind.SoundThe audio on COD4 is also pretty good. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. It's so seamless in COD4 that I've come to rely on it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. There's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without silencers, but I suppose only a gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right. There's a couple of mis-steps here too though - the Mini Uzi sounds like a child's toy for example. The voice talent is varied but too many of the English characters sound like Dick Van Dyke doing cockney. Come on - this is the 21st century - couldn't they get English people to do the English accents?Single playerSingle player mode is a good intro to COD4. The maps are varied and the missions are split between US and UK troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works.Enemy AI is so-so in COD4. There are some neat new tricks compared to other run-and-gun games but ultimately you'll be able to out-think the AI pretty quickly. You need to; there are no health packs in this game. You have overall health and that's it. If you get badly shot up, you can hide and recover, but in a full on smackdown with enemy troops, there's no time to hide so it becomes a question of speed, skill and luck to stay alive.As I said above, the maps are quite small and confined This is good because it means at no point during gameplay do you ever come across a loading screen unless you change maps or missions. It's bad because you can run from one side of the map to the other in about 30 seconds on the largest map which means there's not a lot of free-roaming capability. The game itself is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes.The weapons choice is wide and varied and there's an option to throw grenades back if one lands close to you and you have quick reactions. Invariably when I try this though, it goes off in my face and that's the end of that. Each weapon has iron sights or laser / scope / dot sights. Some of the aiming positions are counterintuitive though. The MP44 and M14 assualt rifles have the distinct look of shooting diagonally instead of straight. I've never quite got used to this and if I end up with one of these things, the enemy automatically has an advantage over me.Without a doubt, the best single player mission is where you find yourself at the weapons controls of a C130 gunship. This entire level is played through an infrared sensor channel. You're orbiting a village and your task is to keep your troops on the ground safe from enemy attack. Your troops are marked with infrared beacons, so they all pulse or flash in the sensor view. You have three different guns at your disposal from rapid-fire machine gun to what-the-hell-was-that cannon. I think if you play COD4 through to the end, you'll eventually only ever re-play this level in single player mode.OnlineOnline gameplay is where COD4 really shines in terms of fun factor. Unlike days of old where inexperienced players would drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who could snipe them through glitches in the map, COD4 has a load balancing system. As a newbie, you have zero experience points so you get put in games with other people way down the scale. This means you get a chance to learn the maps and figure out how best to play without the frustration of instantly dying because you re-spawned near someone who has a zillion hours of game time under their belt.The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one. As your experience increases, you get put in maps with other players with similar levels of experience. In this way it leads you into the all-guns-blazing experts-only matches quite gently.There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. COD4 does support headsets chat, but until the first patch came out, there was no way to mute other players, which meant you were treated to levels of swearing that you probably had no idea existed in civilised society. Fortunately, now you can mute the players with Tourette's which makes it a lot more enjoyable. The problem is that a lot of people assume that because they've got an open mic and a captive audience, it gives them the right to behave like a total goon.There are issues with the online play though. You'll often come across a situation where you are clearly shooting someone else but your hits aren't having any effect. When you die, the replay cam will show you the same gunfight from your opponents point of view and there will appear to be an obvious disconnect between when you thought you were shooting, and when the game considered you to be shooting from the other player's perspective. I call it bullet lag. More often than not it clears itself, but occasionally the online match will just become impossible to play because of it and you have no choice but to exit and join another game.The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a \"\"host ended session\"\" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. A lot of games use distributed online mode, meaning all the machines track the progress of the host in case it goes down. If it does, another player's machine becomes the host, seamlessly, and gameplay continues. GTA4 and Racedriver Grid both use this technique to great effect. For it to be missing from COD4 is criminal.One thing that I'm still not quite used to in COD4 is bullet penetration. Get a sufficiently powerful weapon and a suitably thin wall and you can shoot other players through the wall. A lot of the time it's guesswork, but there are enough graphical glitches that you'll often be able to see another player's knees, elbows or backside poking through the back of a building when they think they're hiding. This is good if you're the attacker, but bad if you're the victim - you can often think you're suitably out-of-sight only to have someone fill your back with lead from the other side of the wall.Three stars or four?Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. The PS3 is still a relatively new platform and the developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of it. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely.COD4 is a three-star or four-star game but it's hard to choose which. In the end I went with four stars because of the fun factor. It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the graphical and server glitches, has a high X-factor. It's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like (are you listening Konami?), but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD4 has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.5 stars for fun. 4 overall.\"", "I am loving this game.  I spent nearly all day playing it recently, and I believe that was time well spent.  This is perhaps the best war game I've ever played and it certainly ranks right up there with one of the best games ever.  The graphics definitely are something to behold.  That being said, I still think Gears of War's graphics are slightly better (slightly).  The gameplay more than makes up for that.  It is constantly insane and raucous.  I played it on normal difficulty and it still challenged me at nearly every turn.  The variety of missions is so satisfying.  I've never been bored with this game for one second.  However, I have been frustrated several times (especially at the end, which is where things get really challenging).  I can't really think of anything that's bad about this game.  I've not had any framerate issues to speak of.  The sound is crisp and clear.  It's totally engaging in every way.  This game really shows what the PS3 can do.", "If you like Call of Duty multiplayer AVOID THIS GAME.  Unfortunately the multiplayer for Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2 and World at War are completely ruined by hackers. if you're looking just to play the single player or play private multiplayer then your fine, but if you're thinking of playing online be ready for a huge disappointment.Personally I feel Activision should not sell the map packs online because of the hackers personally I spent $40 for the map packs for games that are unplayable. The hackers have infinite health God mode unlimited ammo it's ridiculous. For example I give you this... when you start a game but there's instantly kill streaks attacking you because of course they have unlimited kill streaks at the beginning of the game. And you want to be careful playing with hackers because you never know what they could do to your account.It's really unfortunate because I love the call of duty series and the multiplayer games are unplayable so save your money please.Thanks for reading!PS Please like this post so it can float to the top.", "\"I have 3 genres that I typically tend to avoid when a new game hits the market. Fighters, racers and first-person shooters. Err, rather I should say FPS that deal with the topic of war since others like Bioshock, Half-Life or Halo are perfectly fine for me but redoing World War II events over and over again have begun to bore me over the years. It's quite an accomplishment we even won that war since the amount of Nazis I've killed over the years (and respawning ones at that) gets quite repetitive and same-y. In comes \"\"Modern Warfare\"\" which not only brings acting as a soldier away from past year and into a more contemporary setting but it also brings some things that completely enrich the experience and make it way more memorable than other FPS (which is ironic since the next installment is again going back to WWII...ugh). While there's problems that completely aggravated me at times, it's still an intense and fun shooter.Story: Instead of Nazis, we're dealing with Middle Eastern and Russian terrorists and the threat of nuclear weapons. You play as a United States Marine and a British SAS as you uncover the plot of who's behind it all and trying to stop any plans they might have. While typically avoiding the storylines in FPS' and just concerned myself with shooting some bad guys, this plot was quite riveting and indeed many moments in the game such as a sinking ship, helicopter crashing towards you or one shocking moment in one storyline, the plot may not be the most indepth but it's still quite awesome.Graphics: The graphics in most FPS' tended to look fairly flat with grass looking more like flat 2D stuff akin to Paper Mario, Modern Warfare is immensely detailed and there's many scenes where there is just so much going on that it completely sucks you in and explosions, air strikes and the like are very impressive. Even small things like the trail a bullet leaves after a sniper hit or the smoke left by a grenade is well done.Sound/Music: But anyone who knows war movies knows it's all about the sound and the mix brings the intensity needed tenfold and in the most thrilling and action-packed parts, the sound here will give your stereo hookup a great workout. The voice acting is also good and even though there's no familiar VA's, the marine chatter and battle comments don't become grating like hearing a soldier cheering that \"\"he got one\"\" for the 100th time.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty much similar to most FPS from reloading, gun exchanging to grenades and lobbing thrown ones back to using turrets but its more refined and I never felt annoyed because my character did something that my hand didn't do. Other than that it's very straightforward from there on in and there's no real sudden curveballs. One thing that did bug me was finding the enemies is still the old \"\"whatever direction the red arrow points to\"\" only after you're shot so you have to turn to find out where it is but since enemies are so intent on killing you, you'd probably end up dead before you got a shot off though there is some luck.That was the major problem I had with this game: the difficulty and frustration that frequently set in during missions. I can't count how many times I had to repeat a section because of how fast I died and well enemy AI is great and no longer just charge at you firing randomly, they're still a bit TOO good and enemies from 200 yards away can get a better shot off than I can. While I wouldn't say the game isn't fun for what it is, there's times where I felt like punching something because of how hard it was to do a simple objective.With a short single player but a robust and popular online multiplayer available, Call of Duty IV is a great ride on any system (despite my own gripes about the difficulty).\"", "This game is awesome first played this game when it first came out and said this is a good game and years later purchased a xbox 360 and got it on the 360 I loved it Then I traded my xbox for a ps3 and got it on ps3 and still loved it. This game is One of the best wars games I have ever play not too cheesy to where you can call it a kids game but not to Realistic to where you get mad and dont't won't to play it. The charcters on this game are awesome and I think this game proves that Gaming companys are really out to make war games that can be played and enjoyed by people. First off I have to say say the campaign is a bit short even on vetran beet it on vetran in about 10 hours. Besides the fact of being a bit short The missions are awesome the guns are realistic The charcters really make you get attached to them and The enemys really make you want to kill them. Second off the Multiplay is pretty good would be better if I had playstation Network but it is still good.The maps on multiplayer are a bit small in my oponion but thats ok it just makes it easiers to find people. I would reccomend if playing Multiplay play on hardcore mode it dosen't show the others players on the minimap. That is if you like a challenge but if you don't like a challenge just play it on the regular mode. Next Arcade Mode I really hate arcade mode because it sees how fast you can beat the missions. When I play games I like to play at my own pace and not some timer. That is why I am glad the newer call of duty games have special ops.  That is the only Negative part of this game it is not bad enough for me to give this any thing but 5 stars.  I would reccomend this to any body who does not want to pay over $25 bucks for a good war game. Thank you for reading this review hope you found it helpful.", "\"Great game.  Really puts you into the action and situations that are so different and suspensful.  Now for the downside...1.  Started at 9pm and finish the game in 2am.  And I was taking my time.2.  Once you notice that the challenges are easily overcome by the... don't want to spoil it, but here's a hint.  Just run to the finish line.Upside to this is...No stupid alien world.(Nothing against that theme or Halo) I wanted a game with some modern stuff and they finally give it in this.  But like \"\"Black\"\" its done before you get tire and your eyes plead for you to sleep.That's all.Really wanted more out of the game, but just going to rent it.  Unless you want something like(really not like but close to something similar) Halo, this is it for now.(LISTENING SONY COME ON!!!)  Not a fanboy, but love the system.\"", "You can get information on CoD4 anywhere, so I won't prattle on about the game's graphics/gameplay/etc. The multiplayer is phenomenal - it's the first game since Counterstrike that I feel like I could play for days, months, and years on end. You gain experience and unlock new features almost every match, so the motivation and reward system outclass any other shooter. This game is as great as everyone says it is.", "First, I think the PS3 console is amazing especially when you purchase the Sony HDMI cable. The only negative comment about PS3 is that they should have included the cable.  Now for the game:I bought the game due to its $20 off after Xmas sell at Gamestop.Pros:  Excellent graphics, beyond ROM.  Challenging and long lasting if played at the Hard level.  I always start at the hard level so I can appreciate the gameplay.Con:  Too much action.  Sometimes I was frustrated with shooting my own team mates and the enemy is far and distant. Unlike ROM  your adversary is apparent and visual.  Its still fun, so with time I'll adjust.", "\"The Good:- Graphics: I thought Ghost Recon was the best looking game on PS3, then Call of Duty 4 came out. WOW! This game looks incredible. Every detail is painstakingly thought out; from the blades of grass to the bricks on the building, the way this game looks totally immerses you. Crank the sound up and it's like you're there.- Sound: Stunning surround sound via Dolby Digital. Sit tight, and you'll hear the enemy approaching with pinpoint accuracy. Great music/score too; fits perfectly with the game. Music intensifies as the mission progresses... perfect.- Gameplay: Perfect. This gameplay should be a model for every first person shooter. Single player game is far too short, but the online modes more than make up for this.- Weapon Selection: lots of choices from a variety of firearm categories. It's all here.- Online Layout/Concept: tons of game styles, and an excellent point/reward system. It's simple and easy to use. The points system gets you hooked fast, as your performance get you perks, such as new weapons or \"\"power ups\"\" such as improved bullet damage or invisibility on the radar. Overall, this online mode rivals Resistance: Fall of Man as the best on PS3.The Bad:- Online Mode connection issues. First I'll note that typically my online connection is great. Resistance: Fall of Man works perfectly. Call of Duty on the other hand... sometimes it takes 10 minutes to connect to a game. It's seems the Free-for-All mode takes the longest. You try connect, wait a few minutes, nothing... then exit and try again. It's very frustrating!!! Whatever system they're using for the online mode doesn't work so well. If it wasn't for this problem and the short single player mode, the game would be a perfect 10 in my book.\"", "I've always been a fan of the Call to Duty games, they offer great action and gameplay with good graphics. Call of Duty 4 continues that tradition with fantastic graphics, especially on the PS3, great action and very good game play. The graphics and action in this game just pull you right in, the game feels and looks very realistic. The on-line game play is very good as well.If you like the other Call of Duty games, you will love this one. If you like other FPS type games then give this a try, you won't be disapointed.", "First of all I am not a fan of FPS (it makes me dizzy, sick and nauseous and I think the game play is overrated since all you do is look and shoot)The reason why this game deserves special attention is the game plays well and the graphics are stunning.  Other than that, it's pretty much like any FPS you've played ever since Doom (IMO FPS hasn't changed too much from Doom)  There is a learning curve for those who have never played FPS or have not been playing for a while (I kinda wish it would aim like how it is on the PC or Wii), however you will get used to the controls.  As far as game length, it can take a good 10-15 hours.Recommended for fans of FPS.  Please note that this game is intended for ages 17+.  For those not into FPS I would consider this a rental.Note: Only reason I bought this was there was a special on amazon and this was selling for $44.99, of course you won't see that price again for a while.", "i noticed that several people gave this game 1 or 2 stars, it really doesn't deserve that. its one of the greatest games outhere. graphicalwise its the best, no doubt. the rain & lighting, , & the sound overall effects are awesome. the framerate is sweet, & the open-world feeling is perfect. its as  horrific as being inside a war, specially at the beginning on campaing mode when you experience being the president...driven all the way to your execution deathpole, while being filmed on tv AND THEN BEING SHOT!!!! REMEMBER!! your'e in first person view, so its even more disturbing!!! first time i see this on a war game...thats creepy, too realistic for a videogame, it really takes you to the horror and makes you appreciatte what our soldiers go thru in the middle east. this is not a rambo or commando like videogame ,where you always prevail, in this game, the enemy dont give a rat's a#*  who you are. they will team on you, hunt you down, and give you a bulletbath. the way its supposed to be. real fighting.why i dont give this a 5???????- the impact of the bullets are too arcade: they really dont go with the realism of the game, i though i was playing, typing of the dead or something. i shot the enemy many times and no extra blood, no nothing, they just blink a little bit....( that sucks)..- on single campaign, you almost dont have to anything ( just run): yup, the team does all the fighting for you, its almost like they dont let you or they don't want you to take a piece of the pie, always hogging over your targets like ( NO, MAN THATS MY TARGET, GET LOST , YOU SUCK!!!!!) that type of thing..its annoying, and it really makes you wanna go back to the rambolike games, where you kill everything that moves..( oh some ducks in the air, let me shoot em and get some health & the spread gun!!!!) ;)- too short for single campaign: it is what it is, too short. a little 5-7 extra hours on campaing would have been great..if you skip or ignore all of this -, then the game is perfect.", "As practically every reviewer has noted, the graphics of this game reaches a new level. It is not only better than any console game I have ever seen, it is better than any arcade game I have ever seen. The sound effects rivals that of THX movies. It is clear the creators have spent a lot of time refining the details of this game.The action can be intense. It simulates the modern assymetric moderm warfare where one's enemy can attack from all sides and without warning. In almost all cases, the main character is attacked from more than one vantage point, so teamwork is more essential than in the previous versions.Also, you will end up killing a lot of German Shepards (they are more deadlier than the gun holding enemy!), which I am sure has promopted lot of emails to Activision.Two most enjoyable sequences are the camouflage scene and the last jeep chasing scene. The camouflage scenes allows the main character to infiltrate the enemy as a sniper where avoiding detection is as crucial as marksmanship. The Jeep chasing scene unfolds like a car chase scene in an action film, except you get to be the main character. It is very impressive.The length of the game is short, but it only leaves a lot wanting because the game is so enjoyable.", "This is a great game. It is so good that many call it the Game of the Year of 2007. I have been playing FPS games since the mid 90's and this is among the top 3 best FPS games I have ever played. It has a short but incredibly breathtaking single-player experience backed-up by a very deep multi-player. I recommend this to anyone.", "OMG. The weapons, the graphics, the voice acting, the story, the gameplay. This game is nothing short of astounding. It takes a lot for me to say a perfect 10 about anything, but for what COD4 sets out to be, it succeeds on every level. Amazing!! Play this game, then play it again.", "\"Well, I have to agree with the other reviewer Mr. Liam Craig here....While I DO like this game, the graphics are quite nice, and it's a fun game for a while, but the overall game play is a bit one-sided and unrealistic, and the term \"\"one sided\"\" being in favor of the enemies. It does feature some realism, like cars blowing up while you're trying to hide behind them (nice touch), but, you find yourself sometimes going up against TONS of bad guys with literally no end in sight. I mean, shooting at 90 bad guys in one room is a bit of a reach, and they just keep coming!!! Same with some of the other levels. I found some areas incredibly hard, while other areas, were very easy. Sometimes you're killed and you don't even know why, who did it, or where it came from!!!There is one area where you have to reach a helicopter at the \"\"LZ\"\", and you have 3 minutes to do so.....Well, that's all fine and dandy, and you even have air support to do it.....EVEN BETTER! Well, what I found totally stupid was, when you call for air support, tons of bombs are being dropped right on TOP of the bad guys, yet, 79 bad guys are still running around!!! COME OOOOOOOONNNN!!!!!! Are you kidding me?????? Or the bombs miss the bad guys entirely, and hit YOU!!! And this entire review was based on the EASIEST SETTING!Now, as much as I found some of the bits of this game V-E-R-Y unrealistic, I suppose it's got it's \"\"fun factor\"\", and it did have some great moments, but, I still find myself going back to my old favorites: Sniper Elite, and the SOCOM series I, II, 3 & 4 for my military gaming fun. They're still better and (to me) they offer more realism than this game offers!PROS: I love that you can use walls, cars, buildings, for cover, shooting through wood crates & thin metal walls to kill a person (which is very realistic), the ability to throw grenades back to the bad guys, the weapons are quite realistic, sniping is fun...etc...CONS: Many areas could have been improved on. Way too many bad guys in many areas, certain sections were just way too hard, yet, others were quite easy. If you set a game on \"\"Easy\"\" or \"\"Hard\"\" it should be the same throughout the entire game. Not INCREDIBLY hard, and easy at the same time.Now, I can not review the online game play, since I do not use any of my PS systems for online play, (I just don't have the time) heheI would however, like to see a new PS3 version of SOCOM (please!) and bring back the \"\"blood\"\", please!!!!!! I guess until that happens, I'll keep playing my original SOCOM games for my military game addiction.....I guess I really love the slow, stealthiness, that you need in SOCOM, to complete missions. Maybe, this game is a bit too fast paced for me? Who knows....Again, this was a fun & decent game, worth the money, great graphics, some areas were awesome, some areas were realistic, and some were definitely NOT! Really good game overall, but on the easiest setting, this game should not have been this hard to beat. However, even with all the things I did not like about it, I do feel that it was worth the money, and it's still a fun game to play, but I feel that it could have been improved upon a bit more before it was released.Just my .02c worth!\"", "This game will probably have so many ports in the future for changing the FPS genre. maybe even to the PS Vita. This game brought me into FPS games. come to think of its the only online game i'd give a 10 to. mw2 online was a 9 for me. get this game if you love nonstop fun online gaming with great no scope action", "I've played this game over 300 hours and am still playing it now.  I just went through story mode at Veteran difficulty and I have a new-found respect for real Marines.  This is the best First Person Shooter (FPS) game ever made.  The graphics are ultra-realistic.  The gameplay is smooth (except for a few minor areas) in both story mode and online play.  My main complaint is that you can't mute other online players -- so you have to listen to little Timmy ordering dinner from Pizza Hut.  Nevertheless, in comparison with anything from EA/Ubisoft, this is 10 times better.  Drake's fortune was fun but there's no online play.  If you only buy one game, this is the one.  I'd buy a PS3 just to play this game.  BTW: I have the PC version too but I can't master the controls.  If you get a modded PS3 controller, you get a big advantage.", "Its 2013 and its still a fun game to play.. minus some of the hacked games i run into from time to time, but still fun to play with friends", "It's been awhile since i've been so completely happy with a 1st person shooter game... and thanks to COD4 i can be happy again!Campaign Mode: I'm a descent gamer, maybe a little above average, but i found that COD4 is no joke. Run and gun does not work so well. Precise aiming and patience is a must. I really dont recall how long it took me to beat the game, but... it wasn't that long at all. The story was great though, sniper stage was great, and so was being an aerial gunner in the aerial gunner stage.Online Play: Is great. For the most part i didn't have any big issues. lots of challenges to complete. The maps are nicely laid out and the modes are fun as well.Graphics: AWESOME, AWESOME.... AND... AWESOME!Replay value: Great.I've always liked Halo.. and Halo 3 is a good game... but it doesn't seem to exist anymore in my living room...Call of Duty 4 is the only First Person Shooter in my mind right now =)", "\"Everything you have read about this game is true. It is simply an experience that you will NOT forget. The intensity, the gameplay, all come together in an immersive experience that no other FPS has offered in a VERY long time. The only other title that comes close is Half-Life 2, but this game takes it up another notch. BOTH the campaign mode AND online multiplayer are superb!This game is a \"\"MUST-PLAY\"\" if you have any interest at all in FPS titles. Do yourself a favor and pick this up NOW!!!\"", "This is where it all started.  This took the FPS genre to a whole new level.  Not only did this game leave behind the standard WWII setting, it added some amazing features as well.  Loadout customizations, leveling systems, several game modes not normally seen in FPS games.  The list goes on and on.  Some of the maps quite frankly suck, but overall this game is great.CONS: quicksniping online.  Basically people cheating using a glitch involved with snipers.  very frustrating.There are a few gems in the multiplayer maps, but most of them are average at best.", "Call of Duty 4 is going to leave alot of shellshocked gamers(I can hear the grenades tinking around me still).  It delivers a flawless Single Player FPS campaign experience throughout.  The enemies are ferocious if a little predictable in where they pop up.  The challenge really comes in when you notch the difficulty up and take off aim assist, as you have to spot them on your own without the minor lock on the game offers.  An experience that is both numbing and actually strongly anti war and nukes COD4 feels like a very real visceral military amusement park ride that offers a great variety of scenarios and environments.  Not that the content is taken lightly for the most part there is a strong sense of the absolute madness of war that exceeds that of past WWII COD titles.  Straightforward menus a robust online multiplayer experience and an arcade mode that allows you to shoot for the whole campaign or best your scores one level at a time, and a few unlockable cheats will keep you coming back as the main game is worth playing through on Regular and Hardened mode repeatedly.  Strongly produced and envisioned this is bang for gaming dollar in every sense of the word, just stay low and use your grenades as this is one of the deadliest firefights in VG history so far.", "I guess I'll add my two cents on this game though most has already been said. I just got this game about a week ago and let me just say that the difference between COD 3 and COD 4 is like the difference between 8 tracks and CD's. I love this game. Like many have said the campaign mode is way too short but is very good. The battles are intense and VERY immersing. You really feel enveloped in the battle. Bullets flying every which way, grenades, RPGs, attack dogs, shouts from your team mates, it's pure chaos and it's wonderful. I've found out one thing while playing this game, I would suck as a combat soldier. I'm not much for online combat so I can't comment on that part. What I really liked about playing this game was the frequent checkpoints. If you get killed you don't have to start way back like so many games. I'm very happy I bought this game.Great graphics and sound effects (my neighbor must really hate me now). Get it on sale if you can like i did, $60 is a lot for a game with such a short campaign mode. My only comment to any developers that might be reading this is; It's a Blu Ray disc for Pete's sake, USE IT !!! More maps please !!!", "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare may well be the game of the year, it is one of the most fun I had in a game for a while, especially for a first person shooter. Resistance: Fall of Man, Rainbow Six Vegas and Call of Duty 3 are the only first person hooter games I got and that all are good in there own way. Call of Duty easily beats all of them out of the competition. Call of Duty completely delivers in almost every category that a game is based on. The graphics are the best (But a lil better on 360), The sound is immersive that you would think you were actually on the battlefield if you were blind/. The presentation is great, its like you are actually in the game sometimes.There are a lot of people complaining about the single player campaign, that it is too short, and I'm very sad to report that it is pretty short. But even though it is short, the replay value is great even after you beat the game. First is obviously the online play, it is one of the deepest online mechanics, from customizing your own class to customizing your weapons the online play will keep you playing long into the end of next year. Plus once you beat the game, there is an arcade mode in which you play the campaign only this time there is a point system and you earn points from killing enemies. There is also split screen with 4 players which was absent from Call of Duty 3 for the PS3 last year which annoyed the f*** outta me. But even so there is very little things wrong with this game and 10x better than call of duty 3 so pick it up cuz this is one of the best games for the PS3 this year.PROS-Gameplay - tight PS3 controls (can't wait till Dualshock 3)-Graphics - one of the realest graphics I have ever seen-Sound - Call of duty has always been famous for its authentic sound and this one's no different-Campaign - short but one of the best campaigns of all time in my opinion-Online (Multiplayer) - FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!-Replay Value - VERY VERY HIGHCONS-Campaign a lil short-No CO-OPTHE BEST PS3 GAME RIGHT NOW", "I've had this game for two days now and have managed to get pretty far into the single player story mode and played several online matches - and I'm happy to say this is one of the best FPS games I've ever played. Call of Duty has always provided an intense single player mode taking the perspective of differing soldiers - in this case a Marine Sergeant and a British SAS commando. Straight from the beginning the action is top-notch, you'll soon learn that charging the enemy will lead to your death. Sound tactics and methodical movements are key. I own the PS3 version and where other ports have failed on the PS3, Call of Duty 4 shines as an example of what a good developer can accomplish on Sony's system. No dips in framerate, gorgeous graphics and perhaps best of all, surround sound that truly kicks butt! Two very minor gripes about this game would be the short single player outing - around 8 hours from what I'm reading and some of the online matching can take longer than other games to connect. However, giving credit to the quality of the game I will definitely be playing the 'story mode' more than once and hopefully a future patch will speed up the online play. Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of shooters or anyone looking for a 'AAA' PS3 title."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.025830397382378578, 0.05741007253527641, 0.04340141639113426, 0.02931329607963562, 0.01725192368030548, 0.02522561512887478, 0.004063466098159552, 0.02402389608323574, 0.04196753352880478, 0.015316027216613293, 0.09441469609737396, 0.03371623530983925, 0.00579448789358139, 0.0009999757166951895, 0.037706658244132996, 0.06162664294242859, 0.02259867452085018, 0.0030297404155135155, 0.04554005712270737, 0.02987505868077278, 0.02576659619808197, 0.024433143436908722, 0.07307206094264984, 0.0010094958124682307, 0.06131606549024582, 0.023385638371109962, 0.052002597600221634, 0.07187969982624054, 0.03384838625788689, 0.0043343836441636086, 0.0068014985881745815, 0.0030445479787886143]]}
