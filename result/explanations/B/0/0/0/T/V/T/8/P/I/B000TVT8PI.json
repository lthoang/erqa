Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level.First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get three memory card slots which are hidden behing a plastic door...so as to not diminish the appearance of the PS3. Also they included four USB outlets. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review.I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use.The PS3 also has a photo viewer. You can download photos by two different means. One is by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is. Next you can download the pictures with a memory card. This operation is rather simple and downloads are quick. Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. It allows you to view your pictures on a blank canvas as they fall onto the blank canvas. Slide shows are best when you set them to your music.Next is the music player. You can dowload songs by two different means. One being memory card and the other cd. Songs download much quicker via memory card than cd. Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well. You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures. It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there.I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Bluray player. Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier.  The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture.  For many of the new movies it is almost difficult to notice a difference in a DVD picture and Blu-ray picture.Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. For any PS2 owner it also carries your virtual memory card with all your game data. As far as the games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football are deficent on the PS3 compared  to XBox 360 counterparts. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this holiday season and beyond. I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360.Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. Which is obviously not very unique. The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. It did not work for me then. Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play.There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners.  Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University.  The program runs when your PS3 is idle.  What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases.  A beneficial plus to the PS3.  I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems.  Secondly I want to talk about HOME.  No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available early 2008.  This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players.  I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential.2008 will be an exciting year for PS3 owners.  The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games.  The PS3 will have over a half dozen superb games releasing next year.  Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy are just the beginning.  If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3.In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $500 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, memory card readers, HDMI, and of course the game playing.I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.", "\"I was fortunate to pick up yesterday the now-discontinued 80 GB PS3. I'm pretty happy with the purchase, although there are some bad points to the new playstation. Still, let's begin with the good:1) Solid construction - the machine itself is pretty damn solid. I think it weighs 10-12 pounds or so. I like the jet-black reflective color, although it looks like it hides a turn-table or something.2) Backward compatibility - this has been beaten in the ground, but its worth mentioning. The current 40 GB model lacks backward compatibility. It's a stupid move by Sony on my part, as this feature is worth the extra bucks spent (although not worth the exhorbitant rates charged by some of the private sellers hosted by Amazon.3) Wireless controller - man, I hate the fact that the Wii controller uses batteries. So many batteries. Wouldn't it be much simpler to have a wireless controller charge an internal battery off of the machine itself? Voila. The PS3 gets this one right.4) Multiple use - Blu-ray is poised to dominate the home entertainment market in the next few years. If you don't believe me, just look at the recent jump in Sony's stock prices. It is very nice to get a Blu-ray player on this machine. Of course, there is a downside to this, which I'll elaborate on later, but I'm happy to have the technology. You can also load photos, music, etc. on the machine, but this is less interesting to me.5) Great graphics - Stellar stuff. The graphical potential of this machine is almost unchartable. If it can just get off the ground (and I think it finally is, despite the buffoonery of the Sony execs), watch out. The PS3 will REALLY shine in this department.Now, the bad:1) Lack of software - Sony has been monumentally stupid in its wooing of 3rd party platformers, and it shows. The dearth of games on the system is unacceptable. Hope is on the horizon, but man, lots of good games have been lost to X-Box 360.2) Devotion to Blu-ray - it is my opinion that Sony is banking on the PS3 to be a Blu-ray delivery device, rather than a gaming machine. If you look at the \"\"evolution\"\" of the system, we've seen deletions of backward compatibility in every iteration of the system, and now it is completely gone. My opinion is that SOny thinks they can get away with this, since people will (supposedly) buy the system for its Blu-Ray player. It's a shortsighted vision - as the Wii has proven, gamers want machines...that play games. Sure, the extras are great, but I didn't buy the PS3 for its Blu-Ray.3) Ridiculously large - did this machine REALLY need to look like it houses a turntable? It looks like something out of the 70s, with a jet-black finish.4) Dearth of games - did I mention this already? Well, it bears repeating.Sony will rise high with this machine, as it is a good one. They won't dominate the market anymore, which is also good, as it should cleanse the execs of the arrogance that has surrounded this system (Nintendo ran into this problem in the mid-t0-late 90s, with their 64DD debacle, as well as their loss of market share from the N64). All in all, I expect this machine to do well in the long run, as Sony realizes just how arrogant it has been in all of this. Until then, tread water.Addendum: Don't buy a $750 80 GB machine. The backward compatibility isn't worth it. There are still some of these machines in stores (check places like Sears and Kmart, where no one seems to shop anymore), but in the end, I would just get a 40 GB machine and hold onto my PS2, rather than pay these ridiculous gougers the prices they seek.\"", "I purchased the 80 gig playstation 3 and I'm very satisfied on the graphics output and the sixaxis controller. I'm glad there coming out with the Dualshock 3 and more games, the only downfall is the system doesnt have many addicting games yet. I'm a playstation fan and I know they'll get more soon. The system won't disapoint you. You won't have to buy those expensive playstation 2 memory cards because 80 gig memory built in. I loved the web browser you can watch movies, videos, and music on it too! Great if you don't have a PC to do it with. the system comes with a cord to charge the controller unlike the wii and 360 which you have to buy rechargable kits for. The blueray player is nice I don't have a HD TV to get the output of it all but its a step up for when I get one. All in all its a 9.5/10 sony will improve and this system is a great start for a new gen of gaming", "\"The PS3 initially got some slack due to a large price point and lack of exclusives. In reality the price point was not big compared to the XBox 360. It's kind of like comparing a stripped down car where you add tons of options (360) to a car that just comes with everything from the get go (PS3). The fact that Sony includes a hard drive and Blu-ray player in every system makes the lowest end system more expensive than the lowest end 360. What's easy to miss is that making these components optional on the 360 means:1. You can't play games on the 360 HD-DVD drive, you're limited to DVD9.2. Developers can't rely on the 360 having a hard drive which impacts performance.3. Buying a next-gen console without a hard drive is not a good idea. Many of the funnest games are downloadable and the other games often have bugs, issues or upgrades that can only be downloaded if you have a hard drive.So what are we looking at for a comparable 360? It's something in the neighborhood of $700. Figure:1. $350 for pro edition, $450 for the Elite (with the Pro you may get lucky and get one with an HDMI, not all of them have it but it's the same \"\"edition\"\", buyer beware.)2. $100 for wireless adapter.3. $179 for HD-DVD drive.4. $30 for quick charge kit5. Most likely a few bucks for rechargable batteries.Total: $659-$759 for the full 360, $499 for the 80GB PS3, and $399 for the 40GB PS3. All PS3s have Blu-ray, Hard Drives, and are equal systems. They differ in quantity of USB ports, memory card readers, hard drive size and the 40GB lacks PS2 compatibility. As you can see, $399 vs. $659 is really no comparison, the 360 is far more expensive with options included.Obviously there are some variations but that 20GB hard drive for the 360 gets used up fast and upgrading is _really_ expensive. The PS3 on the other hand accepts any laptop hard drive, has a backup/restore utility which makes keeping your downloads a sinch and is ultimately cheaper and more flexible.So what about the other issue, exclusive games? Sony has more skilled 1st party developers than any other console maker. Here's a few things for the PS3 that should get you excited:1. Ratchet & Clank - Steller reviews, could be game of the year.2. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune - Imagine Tomb Raider meets Gears of War. Incredible looking game.3. Haze - All the features of Halo with much more innovation and better graphics.4. Little Big Planet - Impossible to explain but the ultimate family experience. This could be the next \"\"Mario\"\". One thing to mention, it's open ended, physics based and supports user generated content. Next year's \"\"game of the year\"\".5. Resistance Fall of Man - Excellent FPS.6. Gran Turismo 5 - In cockpit views of all cars, incredible graphics, online with 16 racers, improved physics. Going to be big.7. Blu-ray - Winning the hi-def war by 2:1. If you don't what this is, start looking into it.8. Media capabilities - Wireless media sharing on your home nextwork. View all kinds of hi-def content, music service in the near future. Some folks even listen to sattelite radio on their PS3.9. Internet browser - May seem like no big deal but I use it all the time. It's a browser in your living room, very convient.10. Reliable - Even if your a 360 fan, what are you going to play while your 306 is in the shop. The XBox 360 has an incredible failure rate. The PS3 is the best on the market. Gamepro recently did a poll. 30% of readers didn't own a 360, 30% had no failures and 40% had it failed. Of the 40%, half had multiple failures.11. Rock Band with wireless - 360 version will ship with wired guitars.12. Unreal Tournament 3 - The 360 version will come out much later.13. Infamous - Super hero FPS game14. Heavenly Sword - Incredible graphics, sound and acting. A bit too short of a game but they may release downloadable content for it.15. Warhawk - Massively underated game. Imagine Gears of War quality graphics in an online 32 player, 3rd person shooter. Weapons, tanks, etc... but best of all are the flying Warhawks. Very addicting, lot's of fun.16. 1080P upscaling DVD player17. HDMI 1.3, first component to support the new standard.18. Better controllers including Dual Shock 3 which has both tilt sensitivity and rumble.19. Home - 3D Online community, awesome features with your own space and shared spaces.20. Super Star Dust/Everyday Shooter - The best classic dual stick shooters on consoles today. Move over geometry wars...21. Folklore - Great mystery/action game. Think of it as an adult pokimon because you fight by collecting monsters.22. Bungie's future PS3 title? Bungie (the makers of Halo 3) have split from Microsoft. Who knows what's in store.23. Most of the best 360 games are on the PC as well...24. Oh and Metal Gear Solid 4 of course, it's going to be huge.So to summarize, I've tried to make a compelling argument as to why the PS3 is a great console and a great buy. I think the 360 is also a great buy given you know exactly what you're doing. Overall however, I think the PS3 is the top console and will amaze anyone who gets one.Good luck!\"", "This system is incredible.  By now you either love it or hate it, so I won't go into details.  But here's a word of warning on the 80 GB model.  The backwards compatibility is very much reduced from the 60 GB model.  This is because the 80 GB lacks the hardware that previous models use to play PS1 and PS2 games (Emotion Engine).  Now, games from old systems run on emulation software.  While this works with some titles, others don't work right at all.  Sony promises to release patches with future system updates, but they've also said their priority will be with developing PS3 games and not spending time and energy on PS1 and 2.So if backwards compatibility is a big selling point for you, get the 60 GB model instead (while they're still around...remember they've been discontinued).  Also noteworthy is that hard drives on the 60 GB model are fully upgradable with any HDD drive on the market.Let me restate this, however.  The PlayStation 3 really IS the greatest console of this generation.  It's power and capabilities are just downright colossal.", "Well. the PS3 falls understandably short. it's not that great of a system. the thing I didn't like about the PS3 is there isn't enough games! where is METAL GEAR AND ALL THE OTHERS? the PS3 as you know didn't outsold the Xbox360! not even close and the Wii beat the competition with insane ratings. I have played the PS3 and it falls short. cretin capabilities and cretin features are missing. not that great of a product. plus the price range is steep. however, if the PS3 want's to stand out. they need to work on better ideas plus. I didn't get hurt getting the Wii either!", "This System is Cool And It Has Good Graphics. Great Games Are Coming Out! Definitely Get RESIDENT EVIL 5Get this console cause i had the 360 and after a week i got the red rings!", "Since loads of people have already given excellent reviews of the Playstation 3 console, I won't bore you with any rehashing.  Instead, I'll address this Motorstorm Pack, as it compares with other various versions of PS3's you can buy.By now, the 60G model is pretty much out of stock, so I won't consider that as an option.  And for a game console, I'm not going to recommend buying it used, either.What you're left then are the following choices:1. Barebones 40G model, which sells for about 400, and comes with one controller, Spiderman 3 movie and the 5 free blue ray movies (ends in Feb 2008).2. 40G model (Item 1 above) bundled with various games and/or accessories, with corresponding price additions.3. Barebones 80G model (this item), which comes with one controller, Motorstorm game (MotorStorm, and the same 5 free blue ray movie deal.4. 80G model (Item 3 above) bundled with various games and/or accessories, with corresponding price additions.To compare the 40G and 80G model, you're paying a hundred more to get more hard drive space, PS2 emulation, WIFI, more slots, and the Motorstorm game versus the Spidey movie.  Motorstorm is actually a very good game, while most of you already have the regular version Spidey DVD, so the Motorstorm advantage is notable.  You may be thinking that saving a hundred by getting the 40G is worthwhile, but let's not kid yourself.  By the end of the year, you'll have spent a grand on your Playstation console and game purchases, so a hundred is not that significant.  Also, these features that you pass up by getting the 40G are not easy to add on separately.  Based on this, I'd recommend against Options 1 and 2.The only remaining comparisons then are between Options 3 and 4.  Option 4, the bundle option, often claims that you save money by including these other games and accessories, but one thing they DON'T mention is that these savings would be realized ONLY if you were paying full price for those games and accessories!  Most games are sold on sale on day of release, and the price only goes down.  Similarly, both the Sixaxis controller and DVD remote (which is only a convenience, since the bluetooth Sixaxis controller does operate as a remote) are often sold on sale.  Therefore, unless you really anticipate to buy the exact games and accessories that come with a bundle, and can only find them at MSRP, I'd suggesting buying the Motorstorm Pack instead of buying it in a bundle.Overall, of course, is that the Playstation 3 is definitely highly recommended!  So whatever your decision, go buy the PS3!", "The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a great console and with every firmware update Sony adds new features and modifies others making the overall console better and better. There are many people questioning the console wondering why it costs so much and is it worth it. Each and every feature grants its users functionality, entertainment, and experiences that is beyond what is expected from PlayStation Branded product. There are many thing that make the PS3 a must have console and here are some of the reasons why.The online function for the PS3 is made using Sony's idea of keeping it a free user based network. Even though it is limited currently you can send messages to other users keep a buddy list, browse the internet using Sony's own internet browser, download music, movies, game demos, arcade games and more. Sony is currently working on a social networking game, if you will, called Home that will be accessible both on your PC though a standard webpage similar to MySpace and the PlayStation 3 to enter the virtual world of Home.There are a good amount of games available for purchase at retail or for download off the PlayStation Network Store. Prices for downloads range from 3.99 to 39.99. There are also PS1 games that can be played on both the PS3 and the PSP, if you own one, available for download. There are even specialized media available for download like custom Cross-media Bar themes, backgrounds, and game trailers. After major media events Sony will release mostly all content shown for their consoles.If you want to make yourself feel good you can use the Folding@Home feature that helps the medical branch of Stanford University study protein stains from diseases in hope of finding a cure from everything ranging from the common cold or AIDs, cancer, and herpes. Recently thanks to the PlayStation 3's contribution a new protein was discovered that folds at the speed of one nano-second.The price for the PS3 might seem to be a bit pricy but with the features and amount of games available it does justify spending 399 (40GB model) or 499 (80GB model/bundle) bucks but just to farther clarify the reasons to purchase this great piece of hardware here is some more features and explanations on the console's price point and functionality.The reason for the price currently being so high is because of the Blu-ray Disc drive installed in the console. You might be wondering why Sony would jam their format into a gaming console. It's for two reasons for this. They are making it so that you can watch movies High-Resolution all the way up to 1080p, and make it so that game developers have enough space to make a huge game without having to worry about discs changing or being limited by the amount of space.So what can Blu-ray Disc do that rival High-Definition (HD) format HD-DVD or standard DVD's can't? HD-DVD has mostly everything Blu-ray Disc does but doesn't offer nearly as much space which can cause movie studios to limit the amount of HD content or special features on the disc. Blu-ray Disc also has a new feature available called Blu-ray Java which will allow the menus to look even better and enable HD picture in picture if a studio feels imposed to include the feature. Another key detail is that 6/8 Hollywood studios and most hardware manufacturers support Blu-ray Disc.Some people might consider the 40GB a rip-off because it currently can't play PS2 games, has 2 USB ports, and has no card readers. If playing PS2 games is that important to you, either purchase a PS2 when it gets its price drop winter 2007 or buy the 80GB model. PS2 games aren't going to be made as much as current generation games now so truly there is no real worry and Sony should be working on remaking their software anyways so the ability to play PS2 games should be brought back.Another great feature is the internal Wi-Fi Adapter. This allows you to not have to either buy an external Wi-Fi adapter to make your gaming console have wireless internet and saves money on Ethernet Cables.The HDMI port built in to the console is rated to run HDMI 1.3. It supports 7.1 lossless-audio which is currently the best audio quality available, and it also supports up to a 1440p resolution so once TVs manage to obtain the Ultra-High-Definition levels the PS3 will be able to at least play some of its smaller PlayStation Network Store downloadable games at that resolution.Now finally the key advantage, the Cell Broadband Engine, the heart of the console. This processor is designed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. The Cell is currently the most powerful processor to date, and basic desktop processors are expected to take another 4 or 5 years to match its power. The Cell has been rated to be 12 - 15 times faster than Intel's Core 2 Quad-Extreme.There's a good amount of titles released and going to be released this Holiday season. Each of the titles bring something to each of their specific genre making it so that if you're a fan of the genre it's a must buy. Here's a list of some of the major titles out and coming out. I'll do some quick reviews on these games as to show how much I personally enjoy the ones released and have played. All reviews out of 10.Folklore9/10Uncharted: Drake's FortuneEye of Judgement7/10Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction10/10SingStarWarHawk Bundle with Bluetooth Headset8/10Heavenly SwordThere's also a few PSN titles that are must haves, including one that is a bowling game with motion controls.

When i first saw the ps3 i knew i wanted it, but at the time i didnt have enough money to get it. I didn't want an xbox because i hate the design of the controller and the rrd issues. and i thought a wii was probably to kiddish for me. At anypoint, for the 2 yrs that i had it i loved it, but it broke on me earlier this year. YLOD issue.  which is a huge problem from some of the blogs online. i read that quite a few people are having problems with this issue in the older models. what i dont understand is why sony only warranted there product for 1 year. im guesing that they knew there were some flaws in quite a few of them. im very dissapointed with that. Luckily though, i did get an added warranty with my product since it did cost me 500 at the time (bought it from walmart). needless to say, walmart warranty plans suck. i sent it in 3 times because of ylod issue and it came back twice with other problems. still waiting on refund or another ps3. If you ever do decide to get one. make sure you have an extra warranty and dont buy from walmart because there warranty service is a joke.", "First a little background - I bought the Playstation 3 80gb with MotorStorm about 3 months ago. I really wanted to use the system for a while before submitting a review.First I've got to say that the PS3 has an elegant design. It's sleek and best of all quiet. You won't hear fans or anything like that. That trend continues when you power on the system. The user interface involves a series of simple icons that let you do everything from watching a Blu-Ray movie to surfing the internet to playing your games. The interface is very Spartan, but dig down and you have quite a few options for advanced users including several options for home theaters.Now to the important bits: Gaming. Simply put the exclusive titles on the PS3 are phenomenal, ports of games that appeared on other consoles - not so much. I've noticed that this is something that's starting to change more and more, however, it's something that everyone should be aware of.Graphically the power of the PS3 really shines on games like Resistance: Fall of Mankind and Heavenly Sword. There are many, many others - Ratchet and Clank, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Warhawk and on and on.On the control front, if you've used a Playstation before you're going to be right at home with the SIXAXIS controller. Its strange using the tilt functionality at first and some games don't support the feature, but when implemented well by the developer it really adds to the game. Plus rumble support is finally returning to Playstation with the new Dual Shock 3 controller!Online support is fantastic and growing every week. The absolute best thing about PS3 games is that online gaming is completely free. No fees for 'silver' or 'gold' accounts or anything like that; everyone is ready to go right out of the box as long as you have a broadband internet connection.So after 3 months I've acquired a small collection of AAA titles and I'm enjoying the system. I would highly recommend to anyone!EDIT:9 Months Later: After a solid 9 months of use I'm still loving my Playstation 3. I've built up a solid library of single player and multiplayer games, taken my PS3 online, use the media server option to stream music from my PC, watch Blu-ray movies and have made friends online.First, major improvements have been made to the Playstation Network Store (PSN). The entire store is much easier to navigate and to find games, demos, themes, wallpaperes, etc.Great titles have been released including Call of Duty 4, Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4 (that's a lot of 4's!!). I'm also happy to say that the previous problem of porting games from the other console to the PS3 has improved as well. Developers are starting to understand the machine more and really adopt their games to the PS3.With the adoption of Blu-ray as the definitive next-generation optical media format the PS3 is also a fantastic BD movie player with an ever expanding library of movies.Sony continues to provide great support by releasing firmware updates that improves functionality, and adds new features.Games like Call of Duty 4, Metal Gear Online, Warhawk, Battlefield Bad Company have thriving online communities and best of all - it's completely free!The multiplayer aspect of the PS3 is also solid with games like High Velocity Bowling and Rock Band. The use of the SIXAXIS of DualShock 3 controllers is has grown more integrated into games. For example in High Velocity Bowling you hold the controller simulating a bowling ball and actually got through the motion of a swing. Great fun as a party game with friends!Anyway I will continue to make updates as I see necessary. So far I am extremely pleased with my PS3.", "I am very pleased with my purchase to say the leaste, the ps3 is my fav system now I have ever owned, and i have owened alot, it is the greatest console on the market my friends do yourself a favor, BUY IT!!! and motorstorm is terrific offroad mayham, crashes are stunning gameplay and grahics amazing... the game keeps you on the edge.", "Great value if you love MotorStorm. 20 GB more is awesome.
