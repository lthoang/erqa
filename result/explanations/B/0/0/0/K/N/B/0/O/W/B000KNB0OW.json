"], "reviews": ["\"Chewy, tasty, fabulous.  I love steel cut oats and these are great.  I cook them on delay in my rice cooker so they are ready when I wake up in the morning.  I use the \"\"white rice\"\" setting.  I fill the pot with recommended water and oats, add some cream (YES YES YES) and set the timer to have them ready.  The cream really makes them great.  My girlfriend adds maple syrup--but I try to watch simple sugars like that.  However you take them, these are great.\"", "I switched to steel-cut oats upon learning why they're considered even healthier than rolled oats.  Steel-cut oats, also called Irish oats, are regarded as having a lower glycemic index.  That makes it a slower-burning energy food causing a lower insulin boost.  The oat taste comes out more and not surprisingly is nuttier.  Whole grain foods often have a slight nutty taste.The downside compared to rolled oats is that Country Choice takes longer to prepare.  One way to cut down on cooking time is to pre-soak the oats. Once you get used preparing these oats, you can tell when they're ready by how much they've expanded.Other good features of Country Choice include the fact that it's organic and the incredible value.  You get 6 well-sealed containers.  That's 180 ounces, or 11.25 pounds - a lot for the price.", "These oats are great.  A super price and they are organic to boot!  Taste every bit as good as the higher priced brands organic oats. Give them a try.", "\"Thanks to a tip from a friend we recently bought a Zojirushi rice cooker which also has a \"\"Porridge\"\" setting. Wow, are these oats ever delicious when cooked that way. We will never go back to rolled oats and it is terrific to have such an easy way to make them perfectly. As much as I love this product, I don't love Amazon's price. I just bought two 30 oz containers of this exact product at our local Trader Joe's for only $2.29 each.\"", "The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth and is significantly less expensive than the imported brands as a bonus.These oats are of such high quality that I admit to sometimes eating them uncooked with milk and a few raisins or dried tart cherries.  (Yes, it gives the old jaws a bit of a workout.)I also eat these steel cut oats for dessert by preparing them just like rice pudding:  oats, water, raisins, milk, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in that order of quantity, cooked slowly according to the directions on the label but not overcooked, to retain chewiness.  To make it even better, I top it with sour cream or whipped cream when serving.  Delicious and absolutely outrageously rich in healthy fiber:  4g per 1/4 cup of dry oats.The quality is superb; always very fresh, fairly uniform, free of foreign objects with a very pure oat taste.I also like that the paper container takes less toll on the environment to manufacture and ship than a metal container and is also easily recycled.Highly recommended.", "It is packaged well for shipping. It has at least one year freshness date from what I could see. It looks to be a high quality product. It tastes ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! It was fun to eat I know that much because I really liked the texture of the cooked oats. I am very happy with it. Great product. I am soaking mine overnight and then cooking it in the microwave in the morning. It works really good and is delicious but you do have to watch it while it is cooking in the microwave.", "I'm a long time fan of McCann's oatmeal and a new fan of Country Choice (CC). The McCann's is cut larger so is a more chewier product. For those converting to steel cut oats, the finer cut of CC might make the transition easier. I could not tell a flavor difference between the two. Also for one serving I use one cup of boiling water w/ 1/3 cup of oatmeal. Here's my comparison based on Trader Joe's pricing:McCann $4.99/28 oz., metal can, non-organicCountry Choice $2.99/30 oz., cardboard canister, organicSurprisingly the CC has 5G of protein vs. 4G for McCann and 4G of fiber vs. 3G for McCann based on  c. dry of each. Clearly CC is the best value, particularly since it is organic and made in the USA. BUT when Amazon has the coupon code deal, it's more of a coin toss and personal preference.", "These oats rock! I eat them every morning and stay full for many hours.  They taste very good and beat the leading non-organic brands out there.  These are great made with milk, a tad of sea salt, and a little sweetener.  Love them!"], "Gamma": [0.5261245965957642, 0.4738754332065582], "Beta": [[0.1555543690919876, 0.1391475796699524, 0.12589982151985168, 0.10408161580562592, 0.11164514720439911, 0.1302720606327057, 0.10608687251806259, 0.1273125857114792], [0.1597403585910797, 0.1439373940229416, 0.12671467661857605, 0.09568286687135696, 0.11406210064888, 0.13330022990703583, 0.09873538464307785, 0.1278270035982132]]}
