Is it multiplayer "], "reviews": ["\"When GTA 3 was released,it was a revolution in video gaming.Go anywhere,do anything,interact in pretty much anyway you want.All of the extras being unlocked,and straying from the norm of the video game hero (doing moraly right things) was also a breatkthrough.I played through and enjoyed GTA 3 and Vice City,and quite frankly,that's enough for me.I didn't care much for San Andreas because I felt Rockstar made it too ghetto storyline wise.Sure there is some cool stuff added here and there,but in the end this is just the same thing over and over.Liberty City Stories is a pretty cool game,but to me personaly,I just can't get excited over this series anymore.I find it hard to get psyched over finding those 100 secret packages yet again.One of the major kisses of death to the GTA series was how they changed the firefighter,vigilante,and paramedic missons.In GTA 3,all you had to was meet 50,60 goals (can't remember the exact number,it's been so long) BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE IN ORDER WITH A STUPID TIME LIMIT!!! Of course Rockstar cuts us a break with the taxi cab missons,but THAT \"\"reward\"\" is far from \"\"rewarding\"\".Lastly,the radio station is there,but again,it's just not unique anymore.Also all the little verbal stabs and insults become annoying;one ad boasts \"\"become a cop and beat people whether they're getting on your nerves,or you're just drunk!\"\" Also the stale Lazzlo is back yet again,and one of hisquips is \"\"I just don't get as good of ratings as self-righteous rednecks\"\" Ha ha ha hee hee ho hum blah.Ah yes,and the story!You guessed it! It's pretty much the same.In a nutshell,gangster/thug/criminal comes into town and wants to place himself high on the dark underworld ladder.Kill, destroy do whatever to achieve this.That's fine and all,but so very unoriginal by now.Oh,and the hookers are back too and they're just as willing as ever.Yes,you can sleep with them for lack of a better term.-YAWN-I guess I'm just getting too old for this leisure now and it's time to start hanging this hobby up;these games are quickly losing their luster.If anything else,I'll stick with the classics and cherish those fond memories.\"", "\"...for fourteen bucks (the price for a new game in a certain chain electronics store), but this is a mediocre outing from a company that seems to be resting on its laurels.Firstly,the graphics are awful. I read the FF:Origins theory, which is plausible, but more likely, Rockstar released a shoddy product in this regard because they knew people would buy it. Heck, the product description boasts \"\"amazing visuals\"\"; the only thing amazing here is how lame said visuals are.Another problem is control. As usual, your controls while driving are stellar, with different vehicles giving very different feels, but while walking, aiming, or shooting, it is very frustrating. The lock-on can be almost useless at times (the game rarely locks on the opponent you wish), making free aim absolutely vital, but unfortunately, those controls are bad as well. Add the utter darkness present in most of the game, and you have a very frustrating experience.The story? It's OK, I suppose, but tiresome. Yada yada yada, climb your way up the ranks, etc.; you can pretty much tell exactly what's going to happen. Not that story has ever been terribly important in these games, but this time around, it feels particularly lazy.However, it is still fun, despite the frustrations. As usual, getting yourself into and out of scrapes with the local law enforcement is incredibly entertaining, and you'll be tangling with cops and rival gangs early on in this one. Hence, I gave 4 stars for fun...However, Rockstar need to get on the ball. This engine is incredibly tired - it's time for the company to show some of that ingenuity that made Rockstar a force to be reckoned with. This franchise is beginning to suffer from what I would call \"\"Dynasty Warriors\"\" syndrome - with a devoted fan base, they know that anything they put out will sell like hotcakes...\"", "This game was like the same as part3, but just some new stuff, i gottan board of this game. GTA is has the same stuff just beating up people, shotting, stealing cars, and the police chaseing after you thats real old and boring, so this game was just the same nonsense.", "This game reminds me of GTA3 in the graphics department.  But that's not really a bad thing.  If you enjoyed the GTA titles so far, then you will enjoy this one as well.  Last night I got the second island of the game's storyline.  So far it's been pretty enjoyable other than the way too often foul dialog.  So far, there are motorcycles, mopeds, choppertype motorcycles, cars, trucks, and now I found some boats to cruise around in as well as some sports cars.  I am hoping to be able to fly helicopters as well...assuming they are later in the game.  The in-game music barely cuts it though.  Just cruising around the islands are still enjoyable.  All in all, I recommend this title to those of a mature audience only...not for the kids due to language, violence, and sexual content.", "This game is way more like vice city than san andreas, so anyone expecting to see a character who has to eat, go to the gym and etc, will be disappointed.San Andreas was a revolution in the history of all gaming, this is a solid game too, but minus the revolution. You get all the fun of vice city basically, which means cop bribing, law breaking, pedestrian harming havoc.The sad fact is you can not climb, swim or fly and there is no jetpack! D'oh!The graphics are poor and the storyline is not as good as I would hope but remember this is a psp port! It is also only 20 bucks, so give it a try, if you liked vice city a lot, then you will like this one.", "The GTA series suffers the same misfortune as the Tony Hawk games, in that its sequals are too similar. In other words, once you have played one, you have played them all.However, GTA is still among the top video games of all time. It created a video game hype not seen since Mortal Kombats hayday, and many tried to copy GTA's success. The success was a double edge sword. GTA had to respond to the immitators with improved sequals, but they also lost many fans with too many sequals.If your not too jaded by the sequals and you liked the original GTA 3, then buy Libery City stories. It contains many of the improved features, such as changing clothes, jumping out of moving cars, etc. The story mode is very good. The graphics are also very good. Many have complained that the graphics are bad, but they actually look slighty better then the original GTA 3. Another complaint is that the game is too easy, which isnt true. The game has a very moderate level of difficulty (not too frustrating and not too easy). The swearing is toned down from SA and Vice city, but you do hear the occasional F-bomb.graphics=4 (GTA standards)control=5fun=4.5replayability=4.5Finally, when I purchased the game, the sales associate told me that this game would not have the free roaming sandbox capability, that it would be mission only. That is not true. This is a full game just like the previous GTAs'.", "I was under the impression this game was made strictly for the PSP system, so I was caught off guard when I saw it for the PS2 at the local Blockbuster.  The gameplay reflects GTA III; no climbing, swimming, eating, working out, etc.  The city itself is the same one from GTA III.  The graphics also feel dated, but the gameplay is still enjoyable.  This is more of a filler game until the next all-new Grand Theft title hits the shelves sometime this Christmas I presume.  At 20 bucks though, you can't go wrong.", "\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories for the PS2 is a great value. It's like an enhanced version of GTA 3 for $20. It's like GTA 3 but includes a couple more radio stations, motorcycles, more guns, and your character talks. It includes most of the things you expect from a GTA game: free-roaming, carjacking, side missions, fun storyline missions, cops, and many more things. But this game lacks some things found in the newer games (Vice City and San Andreas) like buying property, recruiting gang members, pedal bikes, the ability to rob stores, dating, and some other things. One thing I liked better in GTA 3 than in this game is in GTA 3, your character is a new guy trying to make it and earn respect. In this game, your guy is cocky and can get annoying in some cut-scenes because he thinks he's \"\"all-that,\"\" even in the first missions. Still for $20, it's a great game, especially if you do not own a PSP. The graphics aren't that great, but are still decent. And at least the loads times are fast. I recommend this game for someone new to GTA games or a big GTA fan. Remember, you do lack somethings in this game, so some people might prefer getting Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which is also $20 each at this time. A note to parents that this game does have blood, swearing, and violence, but it's nowhere near as bad as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I teens or even \"\"tweens\"\" should be able to handle this game.\"", "Rockstar figured out an excellent way to hold over GTA fans until the next big re-imagining of the now-classic series.  They've gone back and souped up the older games and offered a new experience of old favorites.GTA: LCS re-does GTA III by returning to the crime-ridden toilet of Liberty City in 1998.  This time you're Tony Cipriani (sadly not voiced by Michael Madsen), working for Don Salvatore Leone (yes, Frank Vincent) and going through the usual mayhem, insanity, and blood-drenched violence on the streets.This is a straight port of the PS2 game from 2005, and it comes off very well.  If this makes sense, the game does seem more 'squished' into the frame than earlier proper titles (III and Vice City), but presumably this is because they lifted it off a tiny screen and fitted it to the PS2.  The graphics are better--smoother, tighter, brighter, and less subject to those whacky effects of things disappearing and fading when you've been playing the game 72 straight hours.The missions are definitely easier, perhaps on purpose.  This is a game of pure fun---all the familiar Liberty City locales and characters and antics, just enhanced.  Motorcycles appear (even with a story on why they weren't around in III), the guns are better, the cops are still insane, there are the usual gangs to whack, more cars, and more radio.  This gets an impressive radio soundtrack, even keeping in theme with previous and future games.  This is a very intricately scripted game series with a ton of continuity points.  Players may not appreciate these things as they ram police barricades, cripple bystanders, run down firemen with blood-slicked tires, bomb intersections, blow up helicoptors, chop off heads, torch people alive, burst heads with sniper shots, and beat people to death in front of others.Excellent game, an absolute-no-brainer for GTA fans, some may even prefer this over earlier titles.  All the greatness of III, and then some.  Followed by Vice City Stories, a similar concept and treatment.", "This is a tie for the worst gta game. the other being gta 3. i think its just liberty city i hate", "I thought this game was pretty cool.I thought the missions were really fun,and I loved the storyline too.I would say this is better than GTA 3,but Vice City will always be my favorite.If you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto and you've never played this one before,it's worth checking out."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.057992465794086456, 0.226980522274971, 0.10605217516422272, 0.1070614829659462, 0.15234266221523285, 0.004661879036575556, 0.06363324820995331, 0.0014841044321656227, 0.0025212529581040144, 0.13568852841854095, 0.1415817141532898]]}
