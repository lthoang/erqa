I like this one a lot, though.I got introduced to multi-component learning remotes decades ago when Drew Kaplan (remember DAK?!) was selling the old BSR LRC-1.  I was able to program almost everything on that remote and drew a few copies of the keypad that I kept on my computer along with a description of what each button did in each of its 6 states.  When the contacts started to get iffy, I looked for a replacement but found that that they cost in excess of $100 and didn't seem to have the same functions as my LRC-1. When some of the buttons started failing entirely, I took another look and was surprised at how the marketplace had evolved.  Cheapskate that I am, I decided to give this Sony unit a try and I'm glad I did.The RM-VL600 allows up to 8 devices to be programed.  I don't use them all, yet.  It has a very nice feature whereby when you choose a particular unit from the top rows of buttons, it sends out a power on signal in addition to choosing the rest of the remote's function. This gives immediate positive feedback that the right unit has been chosen and saves an extra Power button push.I have not tried to map every function from every remote into the RM-VL600.  Some of the original remotes are so confusing that I can't follow all of their functions without a manual. However, common sense says that it will be necessary to compromise if the RM-VL600 has fewer buttons that the original.Right now, I've got the RM-VL600 set up to control my television and stereo components (all Sony) and I use it alongside the remote for my DVD recorder (which has many more--and complex--buttons than the RM-VL600). Writing this review is making me rethink whether I can transfer enough functionality to go it alone with the RM-VL600, but I don't see any obvious maps (in the sense of labels) for erase and TV Guide functions.  Also, the DVD recorder's buttons work many levels deep.The bottom line is that this is an EXCELLENT learning remote for basic to moderate needs.  It may not work in all situations, but NO learning remote will.  That's what reviews and returns are for.(There is one Gotcha.  At least there was one for me and it was mentioned by another reviewer.  The TV/video button is a small dot at the very top of the unit.  I searched for days looking for the TV/video button before concluding there was none, until one day it magically appeared!)", "Nice big buttons with clearly readable labels, and very easy to program the 'learning' function. It already had the codes for my Samsung TV and Panasonic DVD, and I quickly 'taught' it the codes for my Roku netflix player box.As others have said, teaching is very easy:1. Hold down the SET button until the LED turns on.2. Press the button for the device you're programming (e.g. VCR, Tape, etc.)3. Press the button you want to program.4. Point the other remote at the Sony remote and press the same button.5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've programmed all the buttons.6. Press SET to finish.My only complaints are very minor - no backlight, and there's no 'Delete' button which would be useful for my DVD recorder, but programmed the unused Sleep button to do the same - just will have to remember which one it is.I also am unable to get it to perfectly learn the volume up/down buttons for my Olevia TV - if I held down the original buttons when programming, then I found that a single press would bump volume several steps, so instead I re-learned with just tapping the original buttons. That fixed the problem with the volume changing too much, but now if I want to change volume by more than one step, I have to keep tapping the buttons; holding them down doesn't do anything. Once again though, not a huge deal (especially considering that Olevia TVs are notorious for not being supported by universal remotes).P.S. This remote is actually available in two color schemes - the silver one shown at Amazon, and also a black one with mostly blue buttons. I saw both at my local Fry's.Tip: I programmed basic TV functions (power, channel, volume, source select) into all the other unused devices on the remote (VCR, tape, amp, etc.) - this way I can operate the TV even if I forget to press the TV button first.", "This is an excellent alternative to more expensive remotes. From what I can tell you mostly miss out on the LCD screen. However this remote does everything I expected it to and was easy to set up.I have a PS3, sound system, HDTV, and cable box. I use to have the cable box remote, TV remote, and sound system remotes around when viewing. I now just have the Sony and my PS3 remote/controller (both are too specialized to replace).First off I had no codes for any of my components. The Sony lets you search through codes and when you get to the right one you choose that. Beyond that though what was very useful was the smart way you can map individual controls to the Sony from any of your remotes. Just press and hold a key on the Sony then choose the key on the Sony you want to map to. The Sony starts blinking. Face it toward your other remote so the tops of both are facing one another. Press the key on your existing remote you want to map and wallah that key on the Sony now does the same thing. This was super easy to do but does require some 'brute force' and gets repetitive.In an hour or so I was able to get all the features I wanted from all 3 remotes mapped to the Sony. And each device on the Sony (8 devices to choose from) when you select that device the mapped keys work for whatever you choose for that device. The * key on cable I might have set up for return to last channel watched. The * key on TV I might have set for switch between inputs.All in all, well worth the money and small amount of time it takes to get it working the way you want.", "It simply does its job! I use to fumble with too many controllers for my home theatre. Then I dropped my regular tv remote into my icetea drink and I had to look for a new remote. I am glad that I did the research and found all the great reviews on this remote. I completely agree with the rest of the great reviews. And for the price, you can't beat it!Positives:1. Does what it says it does. It was easy to setup and everything is working fine.2. The price is great and can't be beat with all its features.3. It looks nice. There are way too many ugly looking remotes out there. This is one of the better looking remotes around.", "I like this remote almost as much as my Universal Remote mx-500. For the Price you cant beat it and I haven't met a signal that this Remote cant learn it is very easy to use and looks great.", "This thing is great.  Programs to any device imaginable. Clear buttons.  Good size and weight.  I ordered a 2nd one to have as a backup since we like it so much.", "\"You can't beat this learning remote for less than $20! I won't repeat the other reviews except to say that it works well for me, and has plenty of memory to learn new IR for every button in every mode.At this price, I bought a few of them and now every room has ONE remote, and they all work the same.Good show!UPDATE: In retrospect, the output is somewhat weak compared with the original remote controls. Also, it tends to repeat learned remote commands - like if you program \"\"fast forward\"\", unless you press the FF button really quick when programming it may go forward twice into \"\"really fast forward\"\" mode. Also learned keys, such as a volume control, can't be held down to repeat - they fire once per click. A previous remote I had worked more smoothly than this.At this point I would downgrade my rating to a \"\"3\"\".\"", "I got this remote to work with 2dvd players,TV,Cablebox,Ipod music player, even a digital controlled heater, this remote will learn pretty much any IR command. It takes a little time to map every button from your previous remotes(if you want to do that) to a button on this remote, but that happens with most universal remotes. The buttons are big and respond well and there are enough buttons to control all the important functions of most devices. One negative the remote doesn't glow but that does tend to eat batteries on other remotes anyway. I bought a few universal learning remotes before mostly from Radioshack, in the $10-30 range and this is the best in terms of overall options and price/performance. Many universal remotes won't even learn many IR commands, but this one had no problems with the learning feature.", "This unit will cause you fits.  It does not work on most of the codes given and will end up in a box in your garage.  If you have a system with many different manufactures, get a Harmony - not this.  It is glossy cheap plastic.  Is this really the best Sony can do these days?", "\"I guess the easiest way is to break this review up into pros and cons.PROS1.  Easily learns any signal from any infrared device.  I can even control my portable heater and fans with this remote.  Works with all my electronics, including my Comcast DVR.2.  Has GREAT range, works like an RF remote since you can point the remote in any direction and the signal registers.  Some of my old remotes had to be pointed directly at the device, this remote has great range.CONS1.  It is obvious Sony just used an old design they had leftover from some old remotes and decided to use the case as a universal remote.  The instruction manual is dated 2006 so you know it is at least four years old.  The remote feels like a 2 X 4 piece of wood, very uncomfortable.2. This remote is huge!  I am 6'3\"\" with very large hands and I can hardly hold this thing.  I laughed when I first opened the box since I couldn't believe how big it was.  Looks way bigger than the picture.  The cheap looking black and blue colors looks like a design from 1991.3.  Predefined buttons didn't work at all, not even for Sony products since again this remote was probably created back in 1990.  You can get the buttons to work if you manually program them all though.4.  I was mad to see that my local Walmart has a $19 dollar Philips remote that has the same features and is normal sized with comfortable looking curves.  I wish I would have tried that one instead.5.  The little menu/guide/exit buttons feel like pimples.  I feel if I rub them hard enough they may pop off the remote.6.  Like someone else has mentioned, it would have been great if there were two more buttons above the rewind/play to serve as skip buttons, perhaps even page up and page down buttons above the volume and channel buttons would have been great too.7. All of the buttons feel alike besides the big volume and channel buttons.  I am the type of person who memorizes the placement of the buttons and feels for them, but this remote has flat buttons so they all feel alike.  I never noticed how well my Comcast remote is designed since all of the buttons have their own shape.  The reason I bought this remote was ONLY because I kept accidentally hitting that ON DEMAND button on my Comcast remote.  I even called Comcast to see if there were remotes without that button, and I even tried prying the remote apart to remove the on demand button, but those failed so I wanted to try this remote to see if I could replace it.So yeah it can control all of your infrared devices, but it is really big, ugly, and feels like a piece of wood.  I do use it for my stereo and DVD player, only for simple up/down volume controls and skip functions.  I should design my own remote, cheap with slick curves.  Oh I just did a search and found the universal learning remote that is made my Philips here on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Philips-SRU5107-27-Universal-Control/dp/B0026L7B8K/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1263806014&sr;=1-14I would recommend trying that remote as it looks more up to date, more comfortable, normal sized, and most of the common functions we use in this decade.\"", "\"I purchased looking at good reviews. I was easily able to program it for my Samsung 52\"\" LCD (A550). The problem is VOLUME Buttons. Even though I keep Volume UP/Down button pressed, the TV respond only one button press and than nothing happens(This is not the case with Samsung supplied remote). Its very annoying to press volume keys multiple times to get to desired level.It has been end of 3 days since I received this remote, but still NO SUCCESS in searching code for my Philips Home Theater System (Model# HTS3555/37B). I hope I will be able to program that remote too as the original remote is really bad. Thus, when it works its fantastic but sometimes, you struggle with codes like me. I still find the older ALL-In-One Model better than this.\"", "This is a very-well designed universal remote.  It is very easy to program, compared to others I've tried.I recommend photocopying pictures of each original remote and multiple photocopies of this one and use them in pairs to show mapping from old to new.Sony is good about telling you which keys are programmed automatically so you don't have to guess.I like this feature:  when you press a key, it lights up the device key so you know that you're sending to the right device.There are 4 keys at the bottom that can be used to do a number of keypresses.  Nice!Don't let the picture of the remote scare you off.  It really looks much nicer in person.I am using this with a Sony TV (set up by default to work great), a Bose sound system (can be programmed to work with any or all devices!), a DVR (a bit of a challenge because it's unknown to Sony), and a Microsoft remote receiver used for Windows Media Center.  This is going to make things so much easier than trying to use 4 different remote controls (especially the huge Bose remote).Highly recommended.", "The inexpensive RM-VL600 is an excellent substitute for up to 8 remotes. Unlike most low-cost universal remotes, which either don't have a learning feature or have such a small amount of memory that you can only teach them a few keys, the RM-VL600 offers ample storage.The setup procedure is simple and clearly explained step-by-step in the manual. By default, the volume and mute buttons send commands to your TV if a video device is selected and to your amp if an audio device is selected, but you can very easily set it to always use the TV's or the amp's controls if you put all your audio through the TV or the receiver (if you have a home theatre setup).If you're looking for a capable but inexpensive universal remote, don't look any further. If you need RF capability, consider adding theNext Generation Remote Control Extenderwhich works very well in this remote.Highly recommended.", "I try to keep my remote costs down and have stuck to those less than $15 until now.  I got tired of always having one device that didn't work or lost features because the remote didn't support it.  I spent a little more on this Sony 8-Device Universal Learning Remote because of the learning feature.  It did not let me down.  I was able to connect my DVD, VCR, TV, Home Theater and yes, even my ceiling fan to this remote!  The features that did not automatically set up with the device code, I was able to program in using the learning feature and old remote.  The only feature I wish this had was an All-Off button.  For the money, though, I think my fingers can take the pressure.", "I purchased the remote several months ago at around $18, but price went up at the time of writing this review. Excellent product. It replaced 5 other remotes I have. It is a good deal even at $50 for such a quality product.", "This is easily the cheapest fully programmable remote you're likely to find out there, but there are some tradeoffs. It's not very comfortable to hold, the buttons are in weird places, and Sony still doesn't think people need a full set of DVD playback controls for some reason (there's no difference between track forward, fast forward and frame forward in their minds). But if you're like me and don't want to shell out $200 for some backlit Logitech LCD nightmare just to change channels, it'll definitely do the trick.", "I had no idea how good this remote is until I tried to upgrade this. I had this for few years now and this is my first learning remote. I tried lots of models including Harmony remote and nothing comes close to this in terms of value and functionality. There are lots of learning remotes but most of them have very limited memory. This is a true learning remote with every button has ability to learn. Macros work very well and battery life was excellent. I have found a gem in my first try and I am so happy.", "\"This is the easiest remote control that I have ever programmed. It replaced 6 remotes that I was using and programming it is effortless.The list of codes was missing two devices that I needed to use a remote to operate, but the \"\"learning\"\" function makes it very easy and effective to program to replace these remotes. It is really a smooth operation to program each key on the Sony to control each key from the old remote. You can set any key to control any function--very easily!It also has \"\"macro\"\" operation buttons which you can program to execute several keystrokes at a time-like turn on the TV, switch the video signal, turn on the DVD, and finally turn on the sound system to watch a movie--all in one keystroke!! Fantastic gizmo.Now, all I have to do is have one unit to control everything and it works flawlessly. My only regret is that I did not get one sooner!Amazon shipped lightning fast!! Ordered on Thursday afternoon and it arrived before noon on Friday--all with free shipping. I love Amazon!\"", "\"I bought this remote in attempt to replace several remotes and simplify watching TV.  My setup includes a Sony TV, Sony VCR, Sony DVD player, Dish TR40 digital TV converter box, Samsung DTB-H260F HDTV tuner, and a Channel Master antenna rotater. I didn't think I'd ever find a remote that would handle all of these components. This remote is up to the task.The Sony items were a no-brainer. The remote operated these items out of the box.  The digital converter box and HDTV tuner were a little more difficult. Codes are provided, but none seemed to work for me. However, since the remote can learn from other remotes, I was able to program pretty much all of the functions into the Sony remote. I used the same process for the antenna rotater.Not all was perfect with this remote. I wanted to program a macro to make it play a VCR tape. To do this, I had to switch my TV input to VHS. My Sony TV has several inputs, and requires three clicks of the \"\"TV/Video\"\" button to get it from it's usual input to the one I use for the VCR. No matter what I did, the macro would only switch the input twice, equal to pressing the TV/Video button twice. If it had done this correctly I would have given it five stars.I still haven't found out if there is a memory limit to how many functions you can teach the remote or how many macros it will run, unlike a one for all remote I also own.One feature I do like is where you can program a button such as \"\"TV\"\" to do more than one operation by holding it down two seconds. I made it so that when you do this it turns the TV on as well as turns the HDTV tuner on. Very handy, especially when you are telling someone unfamiliar with your set-up how to watch TV. \"\"Just hold the TV button down for two seconds, then operate as normal...\"\"\"", "We somehow lost the remote for our Sony DAV home theater system.  Rather paying $90 for a replacement remote, I thought I could get away with a Sony universal remote. Even though there are 5 or so codes for Sony DAV systems, none of them worked all that well; i.e., we get limited functionality.  I am not that impressed with a Sony remote that does not do a good job with their own products.  While I am generally a Sony fan, this did not meet expectations.", "This worked well enough, at the time it was a cheap solution to our problem of the Tivo remote not having codes to our TV and not wanting to use 2 remotes. Over time it became more and more frustrating to use it, as it would just default to TV when I wanted to use Tivo. Explaining the buttons to company was a train wreck as I had to just pick a button and go with it during setup.I've since switched to another remote, but for a couple of years this thing was good.", "I love this remote! I can use it alone instead of fumbling with 3 or 4 remotes for various components. The learning feature is great! Just point the OEM remote at this one and press a few buttons and, presto, this remote learns the function from the OEM remote.It also has buttons you can program to send multiple commands. For example, I have one programmed to turn on the TV and cable box and then set the channel to the one we watch the most. Fantastic! Then I can press the same button and turn off both the TV and the cable box. Icing on the cake.I haven't figured out how to use this remote to program the cable box (DVR) to record programs, but I will try to figure it out when I get some time. My wife usually is the one setting the DVR anyway and she just uses the cable box remote.", "I'm pleased with this remote -- it replaces Sony's top-of-the-line computer-programmable unit that I could no longer use because Sony refuses to update it to work with Vista.So far as I can tell, this unit does everything it's supposed to do. If I had to quibble, I'd say that the transport buttons (play, stop pause, etc.) are too small.", "Don't know why they stopped making these. If they still do I don't see in stores around my area. Had to order this one online. Use to be able to get this at Walmart down the street. This remote is the best one in the house. And it is the cheapest with 8 devices you can program any way you want it. I think is better than a lot of remotes I see that are much more expensive with the displays on them.", "I bought his product for a friend..his JVC Stereo Remote Control just stopped working/this SONY Universal Remote operates all his Products/except a New Toshiba VCR/DVD Player Combo..or his Comcast Cable Box../its very easy to Program..and if the batteries are REMOVED--your SETTINGS remain installed/the styling is very handsome..and the price is surprising.", "\"Update 1/5/09I find that I prefer this remote to any others, even the one that came with my cable box (which I no longer use). The range is better than the original remote as well. I am VERY happy with my purchase.First a little history:I have a couple of TV's whose remotes have not been able to survive my children's abuse. Also, I got tired of switching from one remote to turn on the TV, another to play/watch DVD, then my cable, etc.. I saw so many good reviews on this that I bought two, figuring I could return them if I was not happy.The Bad:Okay, so I don't really have anything bad to report. You need to read the instructions and all will be made clear. Also, you need a little patience, not much, but a little.The Good:So, once I read the instructions (I have never used a learning remote before) I was just amazed! At first I was a bit upset because it did not control all of the functions I wanted.....well, a bit more reading (yes, I'm one of those guys) and voila, I was programming the remote with ease and within 5 minutes had ALL of the functions from my cable remote added to this one. I am so thrilled with this remote, I highly recommend it. I really thought I was getting something that would have freed up one control, I never really believed I would only have to use one remote for everything.....well, I believe now.At first you might find that the code you enter does not completely control the machine as the original remote. No problem, just a couple of buttons, and a few seconds and you can manually \"\"teach\"\" the remote. I have not enountered ANY problems yet (I still have a couple of other things to program, so if I find any, I will let you know). There was no code for my Philips HD/DVR, so this is the one I will have to set up manually. Sure it's a PITA, sure some might knock it down to 4 stars, but when you see how many codes there actually are (and yes there are some Philips codes), then you will see why I did not knock it down. I figure I am just unlucky enough to have bought a DVR that there is no code for. No problem, I suspect I can \"\"teach\"\" my new remote every function within an hour.....I just need to find an extra hour.If you have read this far and did not buy at least one of these, you are doing yourself an injustice. I can't imagine how much better a more expensive remote would be, but frankly, I have everything I need in this one.\"", "A friend of mine bought a similar remote for less with a few less features. I really liked the simple yet flexible learning functions and ordered what I thought was the same one. I really like this RM-VL600 guy.My theory on buying electronics is, buy Sony. Sony makes everything I need in the way of electronics. Buying one brand has its advantages, generally everything works well together with the other electronic items. With better and better remotes that is not as much a problem as in the past. There are certain annoyances or imperfections to many of the products they produce. On the whole Sony still receives an 'A' grade for giving us more than any other electronics manufacturer.I have a couple of the RM-AV3100s, and these require you to read the manual extensively. 99 percent of the population does not read the manual cover to cover, and then writes bad reviews of products they haven't bothered to spend the time to read the manual. The manual for this remote is very short and to the point. I was able to program everything to about six different products from cable box to older Sony ES receivers. My RM-AV3100 could not do the volume function on an STR-DA90es, which irked me. It worked better than the original remote. This unit also has a FLAT bottom. Yes, that is important, because when you set it down on something like a couch or table, it won't flip over like other dead fish remotes. It doesn't force you to always pick it up for operation like round bottomed remotes.A tip about programming remotes, generally using codes is a waste of time. Use the learning function, takes longer, but everything that you need will be there for you, and in the place that suits you if you don't like the preprogrammed slots. Codes always seem to miss important buttons or not all functions.The only negative I will hand out to this remote, the learn and erase functions are a little hit and miss. After you program one component, take the time to double check the learning or erase functions that you have performed. My RM-AV3100 will tell me if I've made a mistake with some beeping noises and flashing LCD. The RM-VL600 won't tell you much with it's dumb flashing red light, so check your work. I always hit the wrong button periodically too.Another great feature, buying it on Amazon, if it doesn't work, return it for a no hassle. Good luck with that at Joe's Electron World or Best Buy after the magical 30 days.Once you have this set up, it will be your buddy. Buttons are layed out very well. Can be manipulated like a champ in the dark in no time. I have not replaced the batteries in the first two months either. A minor item to mention, I noticed a couple of the buttons, enter and recall, are losing some of their printing. Shouldn't happen. Hey, I use it a lot! No, I'm not returning it either.Final point, a big one, I think I'm going to buy another one for the kitchen, at AMAZON. By the way, what's up with people writing reviews on Amazon for lousy products and service they received at some other joint. Why go there in the first place? OK, I like Costco too. Can someone please explain that to me. I don't want to hear about some refurbished junk hoisted on some unsuspecting consumer at Mom's Electronics and the subsequent sob story about no returns, AND a slammed review on Amazon for a good product.", "I purchased this to replace a remote that died on my Sony tv.  What a difference in quality from the tv's original remote!  This remote is so responsive that it works without even pointing it at the televison.  The buttons are round and large enough that you don't accidentally hit the wrong selection.  I'm ordering another one!", "\"The remote control on my 5-yr. old Sony TV quit.  Just quit . . . wouldn't change channels, control volume, anything!  Rather than buying a new TV, I started searching for a new remote control.There are a lot more expensive remotes out there, but this is an inexpensive solution as long as your expectations aren't unusually high.  It synched perfectly and instantly with my TV and has all the functions of the original except there is no backlight, which I do miss.There is a code for a Panasonic DVR, but it doesn't work with mine, probably because mine is an older model with a hard drive.  It's not so important to me since I prefer using the separate remote, so I haven't pursued the \"\"searching\"\" method and can't comment on the effectiveness of that.I've had universal remotes in the past where some functions would only work with certain models or makes, but I haven't found that to be true with this one.  Even the sleep timer works perfectly!All in all, it's an excellent buy and I consider the money well spent.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the lack of a backlight and the DVR code not working.\"", "\"I've only had this remote for a few days and haven't even finished setting it up.Since I have a Sony TV and VCR (remember those?), the codes were already preset. I've also programmed in my Yamaha receiver and Toshiba DVD player using the supplied codes. I need to \"\"teach\"\" it a few more things to make it entirely useful, but that's been pretty easy so far.The only \"\"problem\"\" that I've run into is that there is no code for my cable box which is a Pioneer digital model. That's where the beauty of the \"\"learning\"\" feature comes in. I've partially programmed it already, but still need to complete the process.It's only getting 4 stars instead of 5 because the manual stinks. Why do companies make good products but fail to provide good instruction manuals to make them truly easy to use? I was able to figure it all out eventually, but it took a lot more time than it should have.I really couldn't see spending a couple hundred dollars for some fancy remote when this one does what I need for a lot less. All in all, this seems to be a very good value.Edited to add: I just bought a second remote for use in another room. This is really easy to \"\"teach\"\" once you get the hang of it.\"", "I replaced three remotes with this one.  I had a quasi-universal remote but it didn't perform all the functions so I didn't use it as a universal.  There are two big advantages with this one.First, the learning function.  While the presets copied about 80% of the functions, there were many that didn't copy.  The learning worked like a breeze.  Also, you can eliminate preset functions on the universal remote and replace them with ones you used from the old remote.Second, the system buttons along the bottom allow you to complete multiple functions with one button.  This was a function I didn't recognize as such in the description.  For example, I can turn on the DVD and TV, and switch the TV to the DVD line with a push of the button.  The only function I couldn't duplicate was opening the disc tray.Great device and a good price.", "\"I have a Panasonic VCR.  The Panasonic codes will not allow the changing of channels by using the numbers (you can by the up/down buttons only) and will not program the VCR.  It is easy to \"\"teach\"\" if you have the old remote.  I did program the number buttons so they are usable. I guess I could spend many hours and figure out how to program the remote for VCR recording.  Since Panasonic is a major brand I would have expected this functionality out of the box.The remote is large.  Bigger than I expected. It is larger then Harmony remotes.I am using it with a Sony flat screen.  Most of the controls are there however I needed to have it \"\"learn\"\" the wide screen adjustment.For the money (I paid $5 more at BB)it serves it's purpose.  If all you need is a TV remote control get something smaller.I purchased a GE remote at Target for less and it does program a sony vcr (yes, I live in the dark ages).\""], "Gamma": [0.12597794830799103, 0.2913406789302826, 0.2913406789302826, 0.2913406789302826], "Beta": [[0.0030831515323370695, 0.0011455767089501023, 0.00030917959520593286, 0.045027248561382294, 0.05110068991780281, 0.015615501441061497, 0.00032997416565194726, 0.0013894571457058191, 0.01719737984240055, 0.06462376564741135, 6.78199139656499e-05, 0.08554109930992126, 0.07076761871576309, 9.860965656116605e-05, 0.000601098989136517, 0.04715287312865257, 0.0019785729236900806, 0.07482468336820602, 6.266481068450958e-05, 0.05592074617743492, 0.05367037653923035, 0.0037007827777415514, 0.0585920512676239, 0.03970305621623993, 0.04318101331591606, 0.0651390478014946, 0.00023177383991423994, 0.06655050069093704, 2.498824687791057e-05, 0.018938491120934486, 0.049992453306913376, 0.06343773752450943], [0.002974890172481537, 0.001988615607842803, 0.0002159493596991524, 0.04840756207704544, 0.05503562092781067, 0.014269774779677391, 0.0007659042021259665, 0.001914787688292563, 0.020112019032239914, 0.0665547177195549, 6.341242260532454e-05, 0.08589909970760345, 0.07074720412492752, 0.0001317551505053416, 0.0004947773413732648, 0.05094059929251671, 0.0015861174324527383, 0.07553035765886307, 9.823137224884704e-05, 0.0590420737862587, 0.05763724446296692, 0.0033834725618362427, 0.05992158502340317, 0.04281702637672424, 0.047160979360342026, 0.04340020567178726, 0.00015369636821560562, 0.06835472583770752, 2.044061511696782e-05, 0.01677156612277031, 0.03704050928354263, 0.06656509637832642], [0.002974890172481537, 0.001988615607842803, 0.0002159493596991524, 0.04840756207704544, 0.05503562092781067, 0.014269771985709667, 0.000765904551371932, 0.0019147881539538503, 0.020112022757530212, 0.0665547177195549, 6.341242260532454e-05, 0.08589909970760345, 0.07074720412492752, 0.0001317551505053416, 0.0004947771085426211, 0.05094059929251671, 0.0015861174324527383, 0.07553035765886307, 9.823142318055034e-05, 0.0590420737862587, 0.05763724446296692, 0.003383471630513668, 0.05992158502340317, 0.04281702637672424, 0.047160979360342026, 0.04340020567178726, 0.00015369636821560562, 0.06835472583770752, 2.044061511696782e-05, 0.01677156612277031, 0.03704050928354263, 0.06656509637832642], [0.002974890172481537, 0.001988615607842803, 0.0002159493596991524, 0.04840756207704544, 0.05503562092781067, 0.014269774779677391, 0.0007659042021259665, 0.001914787688292563, 0.020112019032239914, 0.0665547177195549, 6.341242260532454e-05, 0.08589909970760345, 0.07074720412492752, 0.0001317551505053416, 0.0004947773413732648, 0.05094059929251671, 0.0015861174324527383, 0.07553035765886307, 9.823137224884704e-05, 0.0590420737862587, 0.05763724446296692, 0.0033834725618362427, 0.05992158502340317, 0.04281702637672424, 0.047160979360342026, 0.04340020567178726, 0.00015369636821560562, 0.06835472583770752, 2.044061511696782e-05, 0.01677156612277031, 0.03704050928354263, 0.06656509637832642]]}
