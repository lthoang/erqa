I was looking for a nice tea pot and strainer combo. I figured I'd give it a shot for the price. I was in for a surprise. What a joy to the eye, soul, and palate.Now, if you are looking for a large, sturdy tea pot - keep looking. This is a very delicate, small, 16 oz pot. I didn't get a strainer. No big deal. I don't need another one. What I did get for this tiny price is the most remarkable visual and sensory experience that lifts my soul after a long, hard, stressful day at work. From the moment I opened the Amazon box and saw the lovely bamboo box, I was sold. Then when I opened the box and found the tea in a mini bamboo box, I was very pleased. How beautiful is this presentation!When the tea blooms in the pot, it is a beautiful site to see. The small tea pot then makes sense. The size and rounded body are the perfect showcase for this unusual product. Besides, it is the perfect fit for my large glass latte cup. I've had no problem pouring the tea, and my lid fits perfectly. It is delicate, so I am extra careful.I've had no problem with the tea blooming using boiling water. I temper it with a metal spoon as a pour it into the pot. I don't want to chance cracking the tea pot. The tea tastes delicate and delicious. I get 3 pots from each bloom. I like my tea strong, so I brew it longer than recommended, but it never gets bitter. The second pot tastes best to me, but the 3rd pot is still excellent. And the colors of the brewed tea are beautiful also. They seems to glimmer with multiple hues. Don't ask me how or why.I will be reordering this tea! You can't put a price on the relaxation I get from this experience. As a matter of fact, I'll be ordering a second gift set for myself - my boyfriend and I are fighting over who gets to keep the bamboo box! Besides, if this pot breaks, I want a back up.", "I purchased two of these sets as gifts.  One is going to my sister-in-law who loves tea, but who also is an artist that I think will really be in awe by this set.The care in the packaging of this item was the first thing to impress me. It came in the standard Amazon box, then another cardboard box, then wrapped in a heavy tissue paper and finally the set itself.Once I carefully got through all of the above, I found a very nice bamboo box with a picture of what was inside.  I decided I needed to peek in so that I could see for myself. The box has button like clasps on the side to keep it closed and when opened the teapot is snuggled in with a box of tea surrounded crinkly brown paper.As I said in my review title, I cannot rate the tea that comes with this set, which is why I only give it 4 stars.  Although if you look at the flowering tea sold separately from Numi here on Amazon you can see that it received an average 4 star review.Numi Tea Petite Bouquet Sampler Flowering Tea, 4 Count Sampler (Pack of 12)", "I have treated myself to this beautiful gift set several times now and I can't say enough good about Numi's fine product.  Everything is perfect, from the exquisite tea flowers which are a delight to the eye as well as the palate, to the high quality glass teapot which does not spill when pouring, to the charming packaging which I find very reusable. The Numi company is truly wonderful and their fine teas are consistently the best I've ever tasted.  I will continue to gift myself and also the other lovers of fine tea on my gift list with this extraordinary Numi gift set.  You can't go wrong with Amazon's price as well.", "I can't say enough good stuff about this product.  It is so cute and comes in a nice little bamboo box/chest.  The blooming tea is a cool product and it tastes good too!", "Bought this for a gift, so I haven't seen it fully.  I can't judge the taste.  The box is a lot more fragile then I thought it would be.  In fact, a bottom piece was broken...no time to send it back, so I just glued it. It's a very nice looking gift though.", "Wow, no wonder you can't get this anymore.  They probably can't make them fast enough.  This is such an unusual gift set.  The pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item.  The teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Makes you want to drink tea all day.  The box that it comes in (as well as the individual tea box) is reuseable and so pretty.  I hope that this item is offered for sale again soon, as I would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts...and maybe one for myself!!!", "The packaging was great, came sealed inside a cardboard box which can easily be gift-wrapped. Although I was planning to give this one as a gift, I felt the need to open it and take a look.  Shouldn't have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine.  With my first dinner guests after delivery, I boiled water, opened the bamboo box, removed the glass pot, selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile, and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea.  Oh my Godness, what a sight!  I didn't say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom!  We agreed that it looked like a monster at first, and after laughing amongst ourselves, I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups.  Yummy.  Poured a second pot, then a third.  Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely.  We came to the computer and ordered three more sets.  I know I'll be ordering more, too, with extra boxes of the flowering teas.  Every part of this set was wonderful, from the packaging and delivery, bamboo boxes, little glass teapot, and tasty teas.  It's a real nice value and very presentable gift. Amazon's prices can't be beat on these!", "I wish I could give this 6 stars. It is the best gift ever. The whole package is a hit, the teas are gorgeous, and they taste good.  I want one for me!", "Bought 2 of these for gifts, ended up keeping one for myself. The teapot is fragile, be careful when using and cleaning, or it will easily break. It does showcase the flowering action of the various teas nicely.The variety in this package is nice, bound to be some in here that everyone will like, and probably a few ya won't. But it's a decent price point to sample and find the ones you do like, then buy more of those teas.Some flower and transform quite spectacularly, others not so much. And pretty much all the teas are subtle in their flavors.This make a great gift, and as mentioned before, a great way to sample a few different flavors to see what you will like.", "Based on the mostly positive reviews, I purchased it. Well, believe the negative reviews. The cheap (think dollar store) glass teapot WITHOUT strainer holds 18 ounces. Since I just received this yesterday, I only used one flower which failed to bloom and the tea flavor was not impressive. The concept is unique, but way too pricey for what you get. As for the bamboo box, it is pretty but not really sufficiently sturdy to store anything except very light weight items.", "\"I saw a set similar to this at a brick and mortar store during the Christmas season.  When I went back to get it, I discovered that the store was sold out and had no plans to re-stock it.  I was delighted to find it listed at Amazon.com!  I've tasted each of the teas included in the sample and found that I liked some but not others.  I wish there were more explicit instructions regarding specific teas such as the \"\"pearls\"\".  I found that they were a difficult challenge and I didn't care for the taste very much.  I like the Dragon Lily with the apricot flavor and would like to order more of that flavor but it is not in stock at this time.  Ordering more of the sampler, without the teapot, is a bit pricey.  I wish there were more options for those of us on limited budgets.\"", "I've waited a long time to get this set as it was very expensive when it first came out. It was well worth the wait, actually would've been well worth the cash had I spent it earlier. Amazon has a really low price on this.The clear glass teapot holds about 16oz when full. Each tea flower will make 3 pots. The 3rd pot of tea is as good as the first, the 4th is weak.The tea itself is excellent. Some of the best I've tasted and I'm very particular about the tea I drink. I've been enjoying the variety that came with the pot - haven't found one I've disliked yet and it is fun trying them all.Since you will get about 6 cups of tea with each tea flower - they are all beautiful, I put the teapot on the table while the tea steeps so every can enjoy it. You will want to drink this with family or friends.The whole set comes packaged nicely in a bamboo box that looks handmade. The box is pretty enough to be re-used for something else. The variety of tea is in a smaller bamboo box.If you are looking for Christmas gifts, this would be an awesome one.", "This is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity.  The pot brews about 3 cups of tea.  I don't drink the tea often - I prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special.The dragon lily tasted wonderful, but the flower was really ugly.  However, I did buy a box of this tea and when I brewed it, the flower was more colorful and appealing.  I was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups.  Although I admit that the last three cups didn't have as strong a flavor.Starlight rose was disappointing.  The flower never changed appearace, just got bigger.  The flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty.Flower Jewel was a lovely bloom and the jasmine smell is wonderful, but the taste was weak.Lavender Dream is similar to Dragon Lily.Emerald Sun's flower didn't change.  Flavor was okay, but nothing special.Jade Fortune was nothing special.  The bloom looked like a sea urchin - kind of interesting.  There was no real scent to it, and there was nothing special about the taste.  It was stronger with the second pot, which was unusual, but the tea wasn't tasty enough to brew the third pot.Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long, thin leaves.  The scent is heavenly.  The taste is not quite as dramatic, but still good.  I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot).Black Beauty looked like a sea urchin, and had a mild flavor and aroma.  It brewed 3 nice pots of tea, but was nothing special.Midnight Peony's flower remained the same.  The flavor was like a light black tea.So, the winning tea is definitely Dragon Lily - I highly recommend it!", "\"This is an interesting item and a great conversation piece. The bamboo box and packaging has a handmade feel about it; the box itself is something you can leave on a table or counter. The teapot seems a bit fragile and seems to be made of an extremely cheap glass, and I often wonder if it could crack during use.The teas are acceptable, if not extremely flavorable. Unlike tea bags or loose teas, you really can't steep these teas to your desired strength. This can be a problem if you like really strong tea.  The \"\"flowers\"\" themselves, although they can be reused 2 or 3 times according to the instructions, are really only \"\"single use\"\". They are difficult to dry, and subsequent pots of tea are weaker than the first.  In general, I thought the teas were bitter.I'd recommend this for a tea enthusiast, but only as a novelty. It's not an extremely high-quality item. It's good, though, if you want to experiment with different teas in a unique way.\""], "Gamma": [0.03147696703672409, 0.03346458077430725, 0.03408951312303543, 0.03453216701745987,
