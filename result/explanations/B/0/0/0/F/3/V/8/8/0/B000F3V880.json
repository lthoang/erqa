"], "reviews": ["I tried convection oven cooking my organic, skinless chicken breast with this sauce.  I even basted a few times during cooking.  All the ingredients sound soooo scrumptious but I was sorely disappointed at the end result.  I could taste the mango flavor really nicely but the number one flavor was SUGAR!!  The meat was just so sweet tasting!!  I couldn't taste any ginger and there was NOT a hint of habanero.  As a matter of fact, I had to add a ton of black pepper just to try to spice the chicken up in order to force myself to eat it.  It turned out ghastly!!  I've tried cooking these same chicken breasts with several other varieties of sauces and found the dijon honey mustard to actually be the best flavor but since I love all the ingredients in this sauce, I was so sure it would be the perfect compliment........ but NO!  Maybe the description hype raised my expectations too high but I am glad I had the opportunity to try just one bottle through this vine program.  I will not be buying this product again!!  If you like your chicken SWEET, this is the product for you!", "Me HONEY and me make boolooloop soon... :)And it just happens that Mango puree is the main ingredient in the Habanero sauce, followed closely by Honey - so think REAL SWEET. And apple sauce, ginger, some vinegar, sugar, spices and, of course, Habanero peppers. No preservatives whatsoever.I don't know why, I expected a super-hot mixture, something likely to burn a hole in my stomach if swallowed but, as it happens to be the case with the other Fischer & Wieser sauce I sampled, theFischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6), this one too is a well-balanced - it means NOT HOT - concoction that discretely but effectively enhances the taste of whatever it may be added to. My uses so far, and the Habanero met and exceeded expectations: an Egyptian omelette (don't ask how or why), lamb chops, salmon.When used as directed, the Habanero sauce will tilt any dinner toward the mysterious, the flavorful, the exotic.P.S. - it's a 5-star ONLY if you don't mind 'sweet' in a hot sauce.", "\"This is a great addition to Fischer & Wieser's lineup of excellent sauces.  As some other reviewers have noted, these sauces are on the sweet side and are not as spicy as the names seem to imply, especially this one, with habanero peppers.  Spicy is such a subjective measurement, though, that I almost feel it's not fair to assess it on that:  One person's \"\"not very spicy\"\" is another person's three-alarm mouth-fire.  For me, sweet and a little spicy is a great combination, and I find this sauce delicious.  It's a great touch for grilled meats, in particular, and works as both a glaze and as a dipping sauce, depending on what you're making.  I particularly liked it with chicken and with pork, and I'm looking forward to trying it on some grilled fish as soon as I drop enough hints, and tempt her often enough with this sauce, to get my sister (whose husband is both a grill master AND a fisherman) to invite me over.  In the meantime, I'll be looking forward to trying it out in more and different ways at my own house.  Highly recommended!\"", "\"Fischer & Wieser's Sweet Heat Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is a tasty treat for many occasions and uses. Are you a veggie fanatic? Dip your carrot sticks and other crudit&eacute;s in this unique sauce, and for those who count calories, 50 calories a tablespoon is a good trade for the flavor it adds to your meal. Try it mixed with a cabbage and beef stir fry over soba or udon noodles. Add it to a creamy salad dressing. Mix it with sour cream for a dip. It's absolutely superb with fish and poultry.This is gourmet stuff, and very subtle. The \"\"heat\"\" is more of an aftertaste that tingles the palate, and the most salient flavor for me is the ginger. For anyone who has ever used duck sauce or cranberry sauce with chicken or turkey, try this new tangy sweetness to perk up the taste buds. It is also \"\"All Natural,\"\" and has no preservatives added.I always fear excessive salt in any kind of processed or prepared food , and was pleasantly surprised to find I had nothing to worry about. It has 35 mg of sodium per tablespoon  (a teaspoon of table salt has 2,325 mg) so this lovely sauce is acceptable for just about any diet. It does have 13 g of sugars (sugar and honey) which is not that much compared to other sauces of this kind, and this delectable sauce is well worth it!\"", "We made a mango pork last night with this sauce complete with fresh chopped up mango salsa for garnish. All three of us (including someone that used to be on the Food Network) that tried this dish found the Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce a little too sweet for our tastes. We felt the sugary nature of the sauce overwhelmed the flavours of both the ginger and the Habanero. A little more salt and spice and a little less sugar would have created a better blend.That's not to say that the sauce is bad. We sampled the sauce before we marinated the pork in it and the flavour was better than. Perhaps cooking with the sauce emphasizes the sugar. Considering the flavours contained in the sauce, this would make sense.I think this sauce would go better with poultry - perhaps for chicken wings or even a nice broasted hen. I don't think it would work with waterfowl or game animals though. Maybe with a few additional tweaks it could work with a duck breast.In all, this probably isn't a sauce we'll actively purchase. We'll try the remaining bottle with some wings (as mentioned earlier), and I'd happily take a look at the other varieties offered by Fisher and Wieser, but this was a definite one-off.", "\"I am generally a fan of spicy, savory sauces over sweet sauces, but the sweet-and-hot combo of this sauce sounded interesting. And it was! While not perfect, this Mango Ginger Habanero sauce has potential.As a blend of flavors, the mango, ginger, and pepper work well. It's a very Caribbean sauce and would favor that cuisine--it went great with a rotisserie chicken and some pork roast, for example, but not great as a sandwich sauce on a hamburger or a dipping sauce for fries.However ... I can't help but think that this sauce could be even BETTER with a little rebalancing.  While it's good, it's just a little *too* sweet, while not being *hot* enough.  When I see the word \"\"habanero\"\" I expect that sauce to bring the heat!  Here, the heat is sort of like an afterthought, something that chases the sweet after you've swallowed. In order to get serious heat I had to use more sauce than I commonly do, but then the sweet became way too much (can you say \"\"candied ginger\"\"?).A little less sweet, and a little more hot, and this could be a sauce I would buy regularly.\"", "Habanero, ginger and mango - oh my!  My three favorite flavors on earth.  Mango trees of all kinds grow in my back yard.  I don't think there is a more flavorful fruit than mango; kind of like a peach but sweeter.  Ginger is a unique plant with a zesty fresh aroma and taste.  Habanero peppers are extremely hot peppers with a unique aftertaste that stays with you.  When you blend all three of these flavors you get a delightful taste that can top or cook well with shrimp, chicken and beef.  The only problem with Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sause is that is watered down a bit.  That's my only complaint.  Perhaps the Mango is the culprit as it is full of water.  If there was a way to concentrate the flavors more then I would give the product 5 stars.  Otherwise the product is unique and will be enjoyed by all those who are adventurous and like exotic flavors.", "\"I only wish this sauce came in larger containers! (The bottles are enough for a meal or two for a family, but it would be great to have a gallon size for parties!)Sauce is sweet, like ripe mangoes, and has a slight after-kick of habenero.The ginger seems to be blended into the sauce and doesn't stand out, nor does the habenero really, at least not at first.We used it on everything from frozen burritos to chicken to beef, and it seems it would make an incredible jerky sauce for beef, venison or turkey.I even like it plain by itself, it IS \"\"that good!\"\"I hope they never change this one! They've got a winner! Very natural as well!\"", "I love their Raspberyy Chipotle sauce and this Mango Ginger was great too. Great to spice up your lunches and dinners and for when special guests come over. It's not a health food exactly so enjoy in moderation.", "I love hot food. I LOVE hot food. But the combination of ginger, mango and habanero simply didn't sound all that promising. So, I opened the bottle with hesitancy, and tasted...and was pleasantly surprised.Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce was very good. It's taste went very well with a number of different types of foods. It was very good on a cheeseburger, and even went well as a dipping sauce for chicken. I wouldn't turn this sauce down.With that said, there is room for improvement. It is a little too sweet, preventing some of the subtle tastes of the sauce to shine. A bit of heat would have been welcomed as well. The taste of habanero was virtually non-existent.", "We have really enjoyed this sauce and will purchase it again! The flavor obviously works great on chicken, or for dipping chicken nuggets, but we have also used it on eggs, beef, hot dogs, and my husband even used it on salad one night. It has a slightly sweet taste, lots of ginger taste and then an unexpected afterbite of habanero.If you don't like ginger, I'd stay away from this, since the ginger comes through very strong, but since we like ginger, it's a winner for us.", "When I first saw the word Habanero in the title of this sauce I was expecting my taste buds to be assaulted by the flavor of those little peppers. However, when I actually tried it (brushed over grilled chicken) I was met with a tangy flavor that did not overpower me at all but enhanced the flavor of the chicken.I will readily admit that I am a picky eater and hesitate to try anything new, but after trying this I am glad I did. Now, more seasoned 'adventerous eaters around me tried this as well and also agreed that it had a good mix of flavoring and was not overpowering, nor was it underwhelming either.All in all a solid addition to spice things up over the summer grill.", "\"When I saw the word Habanero I instantly thought, \"\" Oh, no this is gonna be hot.\"\" But while it had an underlying warmth to it, I ( with my pallid Pennsylvania raised palate) didn't think it was spicy hot. I worried also that it would be a little too mango-y, since I'm not that big of a fruit eater. It was delicate and sweet but not nearly overwhelming.It was just a nice sweet sauce to brighten up the chicken we ate. It had the consistency of jam when it first came from the bottle but as it warmed up it thinned out a bit. I'll definitely try using it on lamb or something soon. Maybe fish.\"", "If you like something that brings the heat when you eat, then you'll love this mango ginger habanero sauce.  It's not like Fischer & Wieser's raspberry chipotle that probably rates about a 2 or maybe 3 on the spiciness scale (and it's heat is slow building).The habanero sauce, however, is quite hot, with only a hint of sweetness.  I'd say that if Louisiana Hot Sauce or Tabasco sauce rates an 8 or 9 on the spiciness scale, then this Habanero sause rates about a 6.  And, the Habanero sauce heat starts right away.I hope this was helpful!", "I made shish kabobs last night on the grill using the Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce...delicious!  Bacon-wrapped chicken, steak, shrimp, fish, bell pepper, onion, pineapple, and squash with some cayenne pepper sprinkled over it (I LOVE IT SPICY) all basted with the Habanero Sauce.  Put the shish kabobs on a bed of rice, serve with ice cold beer and it's a party!  Cheers!", "\"I am a big fan of Fischer & Wieser sauces.  They are not inexpensive, but they are worth the price.  The sauces tend to contain natural ingredients as opposed to fillers and preservatives.  Like most of their other products, this sauce is absolutely delicious!  I would consider it a marinating sauce for meat and poultry, more so than a spread, although you can certainly use it as, or incorporate it in, dip.Unlike other reviewers, I found the Mango Ginger Habanero hotter than it was sweet.  I've had only one bottle so perhaps I happened to \"\"get a hot one\"\" but the sauce was definitely on the hot side.  I found it hotter than the Raspberry Chipotle (I have both in my kitchen at this time).I am juding the hotness based on the type of sauce this is, which is a blend of flavors.  As far as being a \"\"hot sauce\"\", like a tobasco, this sauce is nothing of the sort and much milder than that.Several of the F&W; sauces combine sweet and spicy flavors. The F&W; Raspberry Chipotle is probably better suited as a spread, served with cream cheese or alone, on crackers.  That sauce tends to be fruitier with a nice bite.The Mango Ginger Habanero sauce, on the other hand, is best suited for marinating grilled foods.  It is somewhat fruity but mostly \"\"bite\"\".  The sauce is not too hot, but just right. It is nice and spicy, with a blend of sweetness ending in some heat from the Habanero chili.  That is why I would suggest using it as a seasoning for the grill as opposed to dip.I also want to note that I did not detect the taste or scent of ginger, which to me is a plus, because I'm not a huge ginger fan.  Apparently Fischer & Wieser managed to put just the right amount of ginger in this sauce.Thus far I have tried the sauce on grilled steak, chicken and shrimp.  It is just delicious.  I am adding it as a staple to my pantry.\"", "This sweet sauce is just like described, a sweet heat. I really have never had anything like it, and it really goes well with many different foods, I have been using it on wings and grilled chicken but would imagine it even would be very good on sliced white turkey meat, lol. The cool thing is that it is not overbearingly sweet or hot so don't let the fact it has habaneros in it scare you. I usually limit my hot sauce to Louisiana types and this seems less hot to me then they do. I could see this being used wherever you would normally use a glaze. Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised.", "\"I'll start by saying that I do like heat - so there are very few things that are too hot for me.  This sauce, despite the kick of the habanero,is definitely not too hot.  The sweetness of the mango and honey balances the heat nicely, so that even my kids (who don't like heat) are enjoying what I've made so far.  There's also a definite tang of ginger - I love ginger so I love that, but if you're not a ginger-phile you should be aware that the ginger taste is definitely noticeable.I've so far used this sauce as a marinade for flank steak (to die for), a seasoning for ground beef that I made into burgers (subtle but nicely different), a coating/glaze for \"\"bbq\"\" chicken legs (delicious and different), and a dipping sauce for shrimp (strong, sweet and tangy).  My husband and I loved the sauce in all these forms; my kids liked the first 3 but they found it too strong a taste for a dipping sauce and did not enjoy dipping the shrimp into it.I loved this stuff and will buy it again - but I love habaneros, mangoes, and ginger.  if you're tentative about any of those flavors, this may not be the sauce for you.\"", "What is there to say about a sauce, other than how it tastes. I know my palette, as does everyone. My immediate impression was how smooth it was, even though I initially coughed on the heat. After all it was first thing in the morning, and I needed to save the spicy stuff until later in the day. I'm a fan of ginger, especially since I read a book aboutPerfect Weight: The Complete Mind/Body Program for Achieving and Maintaining Your Ideal Weight (Perfect Health Library)and Deepak Chopra suggested eating some ginger and sipping hot water as a good contributor to weight loss. Beyond that I am accustomed to using it when making ginger chicken, with honey and a touch of cinnamon. Ginger and sweetness were made for one another.Let's talk about hot; Habaneros run the gamut of the exceptionally hot range, all the way from mild hot, to emergency room hot. A little goes a long way, and they are fortunately one of the most flavorful. This sauce is just the right blend, and I am not just saying that. After having my first taste, my mouth was prepped for some more. It has a mildly hot flavor that is tempered by the sweetness in such a way that you want to have more.As a matter of fact, the flavor is powerful enough that you don't need to use much, but satisfying enough that it leaves you with a desire to have more. You can't make a mistake of using a little too much. The mango is not pronounced enough to be a concern. It is present just enough to add some depth to the ginger flavor, giving it a very light hint of fruitiness, making it a more complex flavor; one that makes you wonder exactly what is in it. I can see dinner guests upon first tasting the chicken asking, this sauce, what is in it? You would almost swear that it has a hint of orange, but that is not listed in the ingredients. It is begging for orange though, so much so that I wouldn't hesitate to add an orange slice as a garnishment. The ingredients on the bottle are mango puree, sugar, honey, apple cider, vinegar, ginger, habanero peppers, and spices.This is definitely in the favorite sauce and spice category. I think it would be a wonderful alternative to the standard sauce used in chicken wings. This has all the same pizzazz but a whole new range of flavors; definitely an attention getter, yet very satisfying. You can tell I am fantasizing about the different dishes, especially meat entrees it can be used with. I can already taste the flavor of how it would go with steak.If I had to get critical of it, I couldn't. They blended just the right heat level of habanero to bring in all of the flavor, while satisfying the heat enthusiast, and the mild heat enthusiast all in one sauce, thanks to the sweetness offsetting the fire in a way that shields you from the burn, and keeps your tongue alive to enjoy the subtle blend of spices. Overall the flavor is outstanding, but then again, I am a fan of ginger with sweet, and the mango exposure is a treat, mixed with the honey.You may think that I am on something loving this sauce this much, that is until you try it. It really is an incredible blend. My hat's off to Fischer and Wieser for bringing it all together. Highly recommended.", "\"Wow, I'm impressed at some of the gourmets reviewing this product.  I'm more of a peanut butter sandwich and fried chicken kinda guy, but when I got the chance to review this I must admit it sounded tasty.  That's odd, since I'm no fan of mangos or ginger (other than the occasional ginger ale), but it seemed worth trying.This is a dipping sauce or \"\"finishing\"\" sauce, aka glaze.  We tried it as a marinade anyway when grilling steaks, and that didn't produce much; we like grilling with garlic and bacon, and that is much tastier than this product used as a marinade.  Failed experiment.A couple of days later I reheated one of the steaks and used as a dipping sauce, a la A-1 steak sauce.  Much better results.  I see other reviewers complaining about this product being too sweet, and truly a little goes a long way in that department.  The label refers to itself as \"\"sweet heat,\"\" and it's definitely more sweet than hot.  Not bad, but not great either.Overall I'd recommend you pick up a single bottle and try it on your own before ordering a six-pack.  Probably would be better as a poultry glaze.  We'll try that later.  (Footnote a couple of weeks later; works quite well as poultry dipping sauce and glaze; also makes a tasty condiment for smoked turkey on a roll, though a bit runny for the purpose.)\"", "This is a pretty daring mix of Mango, Ginger and fiery Habaneros. The latter is probably the hottest of all Chili's but in this blend the heat level is tolerable and well balanced with the taste of Ginger & Mango.I found the taste more interesting every time I tried it, it definitely grew on me.We tried it as a dip and then  found it worked as a great side to my favorite Indian (style) curries such as Madras, Vindaloo and Biryani's.Mango Chutney is a great side with curries and this works a treat too!My family of four had a generally favorable  opinion, only my 12 year old daughter said it did not appeal to her.I finished of the remaining sauce with Tortilla Chips while watching a movie and still wanted more!If you want something that will give your taste buds a nice surprising tingle, give it a try. it gets my approval!", "I didn't know what to expect from Fischer and Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce. I suspected I wouldn't like it, but I spread this on some chicken and I was won over. Not too sweet and not too strong, it has a nice even taste that adds to the flavor of the food it adorns. I also tried it on rice and it's just as good, maybe even a little better, than the more traditional soy sauce.Reoommended.Brian W. Fairbanks", "When I saw this contained habanero, I was concerned, as I am sensitive to hot peppers (I can't even eat a jalapeno). I used this as a dipping sauce with some grilled chicken, and enjoyed the zing it added. The Mango, ginger and habanero balanced each other, with the pepper adding just a touch of heat that was subdued by the other flavors.Although my favorite grilling sauces tend to be ginger and teriyaki variations, this was a nice change.", "In marked contrast to their famed Raspberry Chipotle sauce, this Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is more subtly flavored, but also sweet, with just a slight tingle on the tongue to let a person know that there are some habanero peppers in there.  So, if you don't like sauces that bring the heat, and are concerned about the fiery reputation of habanero peppers, don't worry, this sauce won't burn.  The ingredients are very simple: Mango puree, sugar, honey, apple cider vinegar, ginger, habanero peppers and spices. The allergy information notes that the sauce is made in a plant that processes peanuts, tree nuts, milk, soy and anchovy.  I used this sauce as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets and egg rolls and it was absolutely wonderful.  Sweet, subtle, with just the merest hint of heat, it's a sauce that just about everyone can enjoy!", "I've only tried 2 of Fischer & Wieser's sauces so far, but they were both excellent and I'd love to try some more.  Thus far, my favorite is their Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, which absolutely rocks.Their Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is also quite good, but not quite up to the standard of the aforementioned Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, in my opinion.  I can easily taste plenty of mango, ginger and of course the habanero pepper.  Slightly unfortunately, I find that the strongest flavor is that of apple sauce and indeed apple cider is the fourth ingredient listed.  I'm not sure why the apple taste is so pronounced, but it is, to my palate anyway.Another negative is that this sauce is extremely sweet and contains 50 calories per tablespoon.  I did mention that it is good stuff, so you'll probably eat plenty and thus the calories will add up a bit.  I wish that they'd cut back on the sugar a touch, as I found it a bit too sweet and somewhat jelly-like.  I live in southern California and am used to spicy foods, so I found the heat to be about right.  In fact, I might even turn up the heat a bit meaning that it's probably a good compromise for most buyers.But I gave it 4 stars because it's quite tasty.  My sense is that it would go great with shrimp, very well with chicken, and I might even try it on a steak.  In fact, I might give it a shot on ice cream just for kicks.  It is a quality product made with natural ingredients and the odds are strong that you will like it a lot.", "This sauce has just the right amount of spiciness and sweetness. The 'habanero' in the title had me a little worried that it might be too hot, but not at all. Also, the ginger flavor is subtle and not too strong. This is great for pork, chicken, or beef, and I consider it to be an all-purpose and interesting alternative to barbecue sauce.", "The flavor of the mango was excellent and I would have given this sauce 5 stars for that but I had to dock it two stars for the following reasons:1) Overly sweetened (probably good as an ice-cream topping though)2) Not spicey enough for something labeled 'ginger-habanero'We had some with leg of lamb and it went fairly well, but would have been better with less sugar and more zest. If your taste runs to sweet sauces which are not very spicey then add back stars as appropriate!", "\"This is an excellent all-round product that can be adapted to many dishes as well as being used straight out of the bottle as a dipping sauce or as a finishing glaze.The flavors are clean and there are no wierd aftertastes from artificial flavorings.  The mango used is the fragrant green and red Central and South American Mango rather than the intensely sweet South Asian Mango.  The sauce is semi-thick and seems to contain a lot of fruit.  There are no arificial ingredients listed on the label.The predominant taste is a sweet honey, then the clean fragrant mango, then a mild hint of Habanero follows.  It is not hot as you would expect from a Habanero sauce. It would be too mild for a hot sauce afficiando, but still too spicy for a novice.  Out of 10 (1 being not hot & 10 being sucicide) this would rank a 2 staright out of the bottle, as the sweetness takes the edge off.  If this sauce were to be used in cooking (heat from cooking increases the hotness of chillies) then this would move up to a 3.5We used this sauce as a glaze over pork kebabs, as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken strips, and to make a sauce base for sauteed shrimp. The flank steak overpowered the clean taste of the sauce and so we added garlic, a half teaspoon of soy sauce and fresh chillies to \"\"beef up\"\" the sauce. This gave it a slightly Hawaiian twist.Overall a very versatile sauce than can be easily diluted/strengthened and used in many dishes.  It is worth a try and would make a nice BBQ hostess gift.UPDATE Sept 27, 2009:Over the past few months this has become one of my favourite glazes to use on grilled food.  It has been fantastic on skewered shrimp, scallops, chicken breast and even on a turkey burgers and turkey meatloaf. My vegetarian friends love this on their grilled veggie burgers and tofu.\"", "I have mainly used this product to marinade chicken breasts; we have used it for grilling three times so far this spring/summer.  The flavor is fantastic.  My husband is the grilling king, but even he gives some credit to the sauce, the chicken breasts have been so tender and juicy.The sauce is sweet with a little heat.  None of the flavors are overpowering and the combination is surprisingly superb.  The combination of sweet Mango), heat (Habanero) and the little kick of spice (Ginger) is perfect, you don't need to add any other seasonings to your meat.  I have been sticking chicken breasts in a Ziploc freezer bag and then coating them with the sauce, we marinade for at least four hours in the refrigerator, turning the bag every now and again to make sure they are evenly coated.  Then my husband has been putting them on the charcoal grill cooking them using the indirect method.  They truly are succulent.  When the chicken breasts come off the grill I brush them again with a very light coat of the sauce over me and my husbands' chicken breasts.  My son finds the sauce a tad too spicy for him with the extra coating, but perfect without it.We have had one jar and have used it for approximately 12 breasts.  I have also used a little to go over cream cheese on a cracker; delicious.  It is a unique flavored sauce andI can't wait to try it on some grilled fish this summer.  This is new favorite in our house and something we will keep on hand.Cherise Everhard, June 2009", "Aside from saving time spent making my own sauce, one test for justifying buying a sauce like Fischer & Wieser's Ginger Habanero Sauce is how well it works for different kinds of food.I first tried the bacon wrapped grilled shrimp with lime recipe provided on the company's website. It's a fairly easy to do recipe, though I suggest indirect heat, as the fat in bacon can lead to the bacon burning, if not catching on fire. I happened have to some Turkey bacon on had as well, which did better since it has almost no fat in it. The sweet and hot flavors of the sauce did well with the shrimp, bacon and lime. The Habanero is actually quite mild in this sauce, it builds somewhat, but compared to other hotter sauces, I found it never overpower.For a second test, I tried it on a grilled turkey pepper burger. It also went well, providing some zing for an otherwise subtle flavor.Overall the combination of Mango Ginger Habenero will do well with Caribbean dishes, especially those that feature seafood, but will do well on poultry, pork, and beef as well.", "At first I wasn't very impressed with this stuff. The first time I used it was on some nice thick pork chops on the grill. It didn't work very well for that and only added a little sweetness to them. Tried it on some chicken breasts on the grill and got the same results, just a slight sweet flavor.When used as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets or breaded chicken breast strips it worked a lot better. For this it has a pretty good sweet-n-hot flavor. It also works pretty good to add some kick to Hamburger Helper. And you know how that stuff needs all the help it can get.Over all this is a fairly good sauce for when you want something a little different.", "\"I ran out of sauce several days ago, so I've been ANXIOUSLY awaiting the arrival of this one. It came today, and I couldn't wait to partake. The sweetness, the lucious ginger smell, and the bit of \"\"sneaky heat\"\" really works for me.
