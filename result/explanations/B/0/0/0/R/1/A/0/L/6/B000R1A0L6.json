However, if you are looking at this game to have a deep and engaging story mode... then you may want to look for a different game. The story mode, at least to me, was very flat and uninteresting.I think the appeal of this game will be in two areas.1 - Hard core Godzilla fans will no doubt love the inclusion of all the different monsters and unlockables. Personally, being only a casual Goddzilla fan, many of those things are no doubt lost on me. I only recognize a handful of monsters so that draw for me is lessened.2 - the multi-player aspect has the feel of being a blast. Up to four people can have an all out brawl, or destroy as many buildings as you can. Kind of akin to the old Rampage video game.One thing that frustrated me was the length of the battles. Most \"\"traditional\"\" fighters have a minute to a minute and a half length on 'rounds'. Not so here. You can easily hit the five minute mark for one battle, which at times, makes you lose interest in the battle and the game.While there are some fun aspects to the game, the controls (especially later in the game) become hampering and frustrating. As a multi player it is fun, as a single player... not so much. I don't think I would pay full price for it, probably best to hold off until you see it in the bargin bin.\"", "This game has excellent graphics. The multiplayer option is nice. Just about any Godzilla movie monster you can think of is in here somewhere waiting to be played. The sounds are exactly from the movies. There are a ton of things right about this game, and only a few things wrong.The controls are a little slow. As with most Wii games, you have a little learning curve about how to shake the controller for grab, twist for throw, etc. This doesn't take a long time, but you can miss a few really needed kills in the process. Also, it seems like every single foe you fight can move faster than you. While this does make the game more challenging, it's a little bit frustrating to begin with. And it will take you a long time to be able to purchase any of the really good characters (like Jet Jaguar). And finally, not every mission is spelled out clearly enough for you to know its objective. Yes, when a giant monster is stomping about you can tell what to kill, but there are a few spots in a timed mission where you'll lose precious seconds trying to find your goals.Despite the few quirks of the game, I really enjoyed it. It's definitely more fun to play this in multiplayer mode (you don't have to fight each other the whole time...you can team up against other monsters), and it gets better as you unlock more monsters. And you can destroy EVERYTHING in your zone! Imagine crushing London, or Sydney, or Tokyo (all with recognizable landmarks). Definitely the best Godzilla game to come out in a long time.", "\"Godzilla Unleashed is a bit uneven. While the game is fun in the fashion of \"\"Mortal Combat\"\" and the old arcade game \"\"Rampage\"\" it isn't something that I would classify as a must have.The combat in \"\"Godzilla Unleashed\"\" is a bit of a challenge. This is one game where the Wii remote only works marginally. It could be that I haven't put enough hours into the game to have it mastered, but it seems that I am able to do the correct move about 50% of the time.The story line... maybe I am too old (32) but I had no idea what the point is to the game. The only thing that I could figure out is that there are good monsters and bad monsters. At times the good monsters will help you at other times they will attack you. I think if I understood the plot a little better than game would be more enjoyable.My wife has concerns that the game is too violent and should rated stricter than \"\"T\"\", but \"\"Godzilla Unleashed\"\" does not show any blood nor does it use realistic types of weapons so I feel that the \"\"T' is probably correct.One area that would make the game much more enjoyable is if you were up against friends. Again, this would make the game more like \"\"Mortal Combat\"\" and less like Godzilla, but it could turn into a fun party game. If you happen to be a big fan of \"\"Godzilla\"\" games my guess is that you could follow the storyline and the game would be loads of fun!\"", "I love fighting games.  MKA on the WII was awesome and in my view the best version of the game with the most fighters.  Once again I belive Wii has the best version of this great game.  Anyone growing up in the NES era would have given anything for an awesome game like this.  All we got was the horrid Godzilla and Godzilla II and more horrid games to follow.  Finally after all this time we have Godzilla DAM on GC and this gem on wii.  The monsters and arena's are awesome, the moves are great, the controls are quite good, the destruction is second to none, the graphics are spot on and the action is great.  The is a very enjoyable game on all fronts for any Godzilla or fighting game fan.  Forget MK vs DC garbage games and get this one.", "For a Godzilla game, I'd have to say by look alone that this is the best Godzilla that has been released as of now. Too bad that it has some flaws that really drag the score down. One thing about the game is that some of the levels, maybe all, can be beaten without even fighting the monster but just by breaking all of the crystals. I had to fight sometimes because the monsters wouldn't get out of my way, but other than that, breaking the crystals was fine. That's another thing, the controls are confusing! Even using the tutorial, I can't remember all of those different things I'm supposed to do with my Wii remote to do most of those cool moves. So, I either just get lucky by pressing a lot of buttons or just press A and B a lot. The camera is pretty bad at times as well.Overall, the look of the game is beautiful and there is finally an actually storyline this time instead of just at the beginning and end like the previous two games! So that's a plus. I'd say that you will like the game if you are a fan of the Big G, but maybe not so much if you aren't", "This game isn't bad but it isn't the best either. At first, it was great, then it became difficult. Later on in the game, the controls became difficult to use, the remaining unlock-able monsters became very hard to get and it took me hours to complete a certain task. The game is fun but very frustrating and time consuming at the same time. It is a big step up from the last Godzilla game :Godzilla: Save the Earthand is a lot better than theDS Edition. In All, I thinkGodzilla UnleashedforPlayStation 2is the better edition of the game.", "A new multi-person brawling game featuring the famous series of giant monsters, Godzilla Unleashed for the Nintendo Wii tries to use the Wii remote and motion-sensing features to make a game worthy of the giant atomic lizard and his compatriots.The game's story and gameplay revolve around crystals being dropped on the Earth that cause massive disasters in cities, and furthermore upset the various monsters around the globe. The major population centers become warzones as giant monsters duke it out amidst their ruins. The major storyline piece of note is that there are four factions; the friendlier you are to them, the less likely their members will attack you during a battle. The Earth Defenders don't care much about humans, but really hate the crystals and want to protect the Earth itself, so one must destroy the crystals to earn their favor (and not, if possible, use their power). Their members include Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan. The GDF (Global Defense Force) is dedicated to protecting humanity, and thus to get their favor you shouldn't destroy buildings and stomp on vehicles whenever possible. GDF robots include Kiryu, MOGUERA, and Jet Jaguar. The Aliens are invaders who want to use the crystals to take over the earth, and so destroying the crystals angers them. Among their ranks are King Ghidorah, Megalon, and Mechagodzilla. Finally, the Mutants want to wreak as much havoc as possible. Their preference is destruction, and so causing as much destruction as possible in cities will get you on their good side.  The mutants include Destoroyah, Titanosaurus, and Obsidius. In total, there are 24 characters, many of which have to be unlocked with points earned through playing the story mode. There is also a multiplayer mode where up to four people can battle it out on whatever stage they wish.The gameplay is a free-roam fighting game with a 3d field. Players can kick, punch, charge energy, or use their powers. Low-power attacks are made by hitting A and B on the Wii Remote (for punches and kicks). High powered attacks are made by swinging the remote while you press A or B (or both, for the most powerful attack). Using the C button on the nunchuk fires your special weapon - for example, Godzilla's atomic breath. C and Z together charge up your energy to use the special weapon. Shaking the nunchuk upwards jumps; shaking both the remote and the nunchuk downwards picks things up. Targeting seems to be automatic in most cases, though you can nudge yourself towards or away from a specific enemy if you want. Besides other monsters, the military is also heavily involved; they'll usually shoot at whichever player is the strongest with a variety of laser weapons and missiles (they can also be customized in the multiplayer mode). For the most part the game plays well, except the combination of moving the remote and pressing a button for the heavy attacks is a little awkward. The characters tend to also be a little slow because of their size, which means reflexes aren't high on the list of player requirements.The graphics are decent for a game that is also on the PS2. It's hard to tell if the Wii version is improved at all, but for the most part they're pretty good. The sound mostly consists of the trademark noises associated with each monster (including Godzilla's famous roar) and the military frantically trying to fire upon the different monsters; nothing too dramatic, really, but about all you can expect from such a game.As a whole, this game delivers what it promised pretty well. There's a wide variety of monsters and playing fields available and it definitely feels like a Godzilla game should. Apart from some minor issues with the semi-dated graphics and Wii controls, this game is pretty good.8/10.", "Atari has proven themselves adept at making Godzilla games as Destroy All Monsters proved.  The unlockable and combat elements of the older title make it my sons favorite game to this day.  What this game Godzilla Unleashed adds is a story mode (with voice over and cutscenes) as well as faction meters to the gameplay, making the combinations of monster on monster mayhem endless.  The graphics are updated and look good enough(Wii).Ultimately all of the extra trimmings besides the new monsters don't add up to much but the extra options, play modes, and reward system don't hinder the game either.  The fun starts when you finally reach Tokyo in story mode and you see what the game has up its sleeve, depending on which monster you are playing as and which scenario you have picked from the occasionally branching story you will encounter new challenges and new monsters which you decide how and where to battle.  The controls for me after a very frustrating 1st session became second nature and I prefer them over the PS2 versions which handle nicely as well.  Bottome line here is you know whether this game strikes your anvil or not and the real decision is which system to buy it for, if you can get used to the Wii controls I think you will find them more responsive and smoother(eventually).  My 7 year old still prefers Melee with its old GCN controls, but I'll take the chaotic story mode of Unleased w/ Wii controls as it becomes much more rewarding as you progress.  The fun is somewhat dampened by the need to unlock your favorite monsters for the  multiplayer brawls but the single player romp is well made and worth playing through with multiple monsters anyway.

There are four factions - Earth Defenders, The GDF (Global Defense Force), the Aliens, and the Mutants.  The storyline itself is simple - basically all you need to know is that the four factions are occupying the same planet, and they are TIRED of each other's presence.  The cut scenes are so painfully 1995 that I rarely let one play all the way through - I just couldn't take the hokey dialogue and campy soundtrack that long.  That said, I suppose the soundtrack and dialogue could be rather entertaining in an \"\"ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US\"\" sort of way.The graphics are nothing to write home about - they wouldn't give a PS2's graphic chipset much trouble.  The Wii is capable of quite a bit more, I should think.  But the objects are recognizable and the fact that most of the landscape is destructible helps.  The monsters themselves are fairly well-rendered, and their attacks and power surges look pretty good.  The thing is, I thought the old Mortal Kombat for the PS2 looked much better - more detailed characters, more spectacular attacks, etc.The gameplay itself is decent, but not outstanding.  The Wii controls are utilized to an extent - shaking the nunchuck upward jumps; shaking the nunchuck and remote downward together picks up objects; swinging the remote while pressing attack buttons modifies the attack.  But the uses made of the Wii controls lack the intuitive, natural motion that many Wii games have been able to achieve.  The advantage of the Wii control system in the first place is that controlling games becomes more of a natural motion instead of memorizing button presses.  This game merely substitutes controller motions for button presses, a move that isn't much more satisfying than using, say, a PS2 or Gamecube controller.  Instead of making this game an innovative use of the Wii platform, it reduces it to a glorified button-masher ala Mike Tyson Punchout for NES.The storyline is rather easy to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the gameplay is the multiplayer, where four players can battle it out.  This makes the repeat playing value significantly higher, but when copies of the old Super Smash Brothers Melee are lying around, Godzilla Unleashed is likely to be neglected.Bottom line: a decent game, but unless you're a big fan of the Godzilla movies and games of the past, I would wait for a bargain-bin price on this one.\"", "I was pretty excited about getting Godzilla unleashed and while it is maringally fun it didn't live up to expectations.  My son and I were able to finish the game with unexpected ease and in little time.  Yes, you never want a game where the game play is monotonously tedious but you also don't want to finish in a couple of hours after paying $50 or $60 either.The game basically combines elements of the old Rampage video game as well as fighting games and tosses in some rather weak story features.  The story involves aliens causing disasters and monsters to raise havoc by dropping somce crystals all over the earth.  It's somewhat confusing at first on just what you are supposed to do in story mode.  Are you supposed to destroy buildings?  Destroy the Crystals?  fight with other monsters?  We got the hang of it fairly quickly but it was a bit dicey at first.  You get Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan, and there are villains such as Destroyah, Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, etc...By earning points in the story mode you unlock other playable monsters and playable city settings.  You get only three settings to start with.I wasn't all the crazy about the story mode.  I liked some of the other modes where you can battle against another monster in a one-on-one battle, or tou have a destruction mode where you battle to see who can earn the most points by destroying the city before the timer runs out.The controls I though were a bit too loose.  I'ts not easy pulling off some of the more complicated moves and thus you end up doing just a lot of kicking and punching which gets boring after awhile.  The various special powers like Godzilla's atomic breath are cool but I found it a bit hard to aim the blast with the Wii controllers.The graphics and sounds are one of the better parts of the game.  The graphics are sharp and the monsters a rendered perfectly and sound just like the movie versions.A fun game but not one that i will play now that it's finished"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.2363172322511673, 0.30499783158302307, 0.012652689591050148, 0.02719404362142086, 0.00887860544025898, 0.06035544350743294, 0.08901019394397736, 0.02044914849102497, 0.21691757440567017, 0.02322722040116787]]}
