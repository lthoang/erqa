It's also in a such a beautiful container that I don't mind leaving it out by the bed, which helps me remember to use it.", "I loved the idea of Hydroxatone AM/PM anti-Wrinkle Complex - anytime a product can do double duty I'm all for it, particularly because apartment living limits the available medicine cabinet space.This cream did not live up to that all-in-one promise. It is a thick cream so it does feel suitable for nighttime use.  Day use, however, did not work for me.  The cream was thick enough to interfere with my foundation and my face looked greasy.  I had to dig out some pressed powder to cut out the shine which added time to my morning routine.I walk about a mile or so to the train and I don't know if it was because of the greasiness of the formula or because the sun screen is not adequate,or something in the product made my skin more sun sensitive, but on a day with strong winter sun I got a little pink in the cheeks - and I'm not that fair.  Reminded me more of tanning oil than sun screen.Can't comment yet on the anti-wrinkle aspect of this, but it is thick enough so it might work with twice daily use.  I'll be limiting my use to nighttime only.", "\"The product is advertised as anti-wrinkle and is supposed to serve \"\"as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer, your anti-aging treatment and SPF 15 sunscreen.\"\" I have not used it long enough to judge it's wrinkle-fighting properties but the box says it contains Argireline which was recently developed to combat wrinkles.Speaking of the box, the ingredients listed there are not identical to the list as it now appears on the Amazon description, so if your skin is sensitive, get out your reading glasses before you open the container and read over the long list on the box. Unfortunately the typeface is small and the pretty silver on blue color scheme does not offer much contrast. I'll mention a few of the ingredients below.Several ingredients are supposed to be sunscreens adding up to SPF 15.  However, some of these ingredients are controversial and may not protect that well. Octinoxate (which is misspelled on the Amazon description as of 1/10/2013) is considered fairly safe although EWG [Environmental Working Group] says \"\"Estrogenic effects are noted in laboratory animals as well as disruption of thyroid hormone and brain signaling.\"\"Another sunscreen in this product, Oxybenzone, is considered somewhat risky by researchers. EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetic Database cautions that it may cause \"\"Biochemical or cellular level changes\"\" and is associated with photo allergic reactions. Furthermore, it contaminates the bodies of 97% of Americans according to the Centers for Disease Control research.Octocrylene is another sunscreen in this product that has dubious utility. Wikipedia says \"\"This organic compound can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA damage and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-user.\"\" Whoa, that's alarming!Even the vitamin A in this product is controversial. Here's what I found: In the presence of sunlight Retinyl Palmitate (vitamin A) may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions. Also, the FDA (USA) has raised a concern that  daily skin application of vitamin A creams may be undesirable for women of child-bearing age.DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative and sometimes causes an allergic reaction. As far as I could tell, most of the other ingredients in Hydroxatone seem to be safe. But I would not use it as a sunscreen due to the concerns mentioned above.I thought the cream felt smooth on my face although it did not comfort my winter-dried hands at all. I suppose that is because it is non-greasy. Anyway, now that I have read up on the ingredients I cannot recommend this product for daytime use.\"", "When you purchase this you receive 1 oz. which is supposed to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, improve the overall appearance of the skin with a safe effective formula.  It has Argireline which is supposed to relax facial muscles.  I looked up all the other ingredients and they are either similar to the Argireline or humectants which attract moisture to the skin, or emulsifiers used to mix the ingredients.  This is for sensitive skin, but nearly all the ingredients are things that could cause reactions, so use it with cautions.This looks like white grease.  I have been using it twice a day nearly every day for the past month.  I think that it has helped the creases around my mouth a little bit, but I can't tell that they helped the lines around my eyes at all.So looking at the price, I am just not convinced that I would pay for what I am seeing from using the cream every day.  I just don't think that I am seeing enough of a change to make it worth the price, but then I don't really mind my wrinkles all that much.  If you do, you might try a jar just to see if it works for you, but don't expect miracles.", "Like so many creams and lotions, it is really hard to see a difference.  Clinical tests measure things the naked eye cannot so technically it might make a difference but I can't see it. It is a rather heavy cream so I seem to use more of it than I do with lighter creams.  It seems to pull a bit going on even though I mist my face before applying.  It is ok but not anything special.", "It's rather cold out when I've been trying this making this more of a challenge, and I do have sensitive skin.  Been using it twice a day for weeks and am having to switch to a product that works better and costs a great deal less. Whether the issue is that it's not as good for sensitive skin as it claims, or if the moisturizer just can't keep up with the cold temps is a question I'm  unable to answer.Diminishes the look for fine lines and wrinkles?  Possibly, but if so, only a very small amount and not enough to replace a better working moisturizer.This isn't worth the price.", "As advertized this cream doesa good job moisturizing.  It leaves no residue on sheets, pillows, clothes, etc.  I have not seen any evidence of antiwrinkle-ing.  Unfortunately still have all my wrinkles.", "First let me say this is decent morning and evening cream that moisturizes without leading to breakouts. With another name-brand cream, I had the breakout issue to deal with. However  think carefully about the claim of reducing the appearance of fine lines. What this means is that this cream makes wrinkles less noticeable. It does not eliminate or reduce them.When I use this cream I feel like I look healthy, perhaps a bit younger, but the wrinkles are still there. I like this cream but it is not a panacea and is quite expensive. For this reason, I will use and enjoy the jar I have, but I will not be ordering more. If money is not object for you, you might want to continue to get this, but for me, the price and the unremarkable results mean that one jar is enough.", "The formulators really need to go back to the lab with this one, aesthetically-speaking.The product has an offensive odor, more so than usual (I know most wrinkle creams smell bad).Secondly, it goes on greasy, leaving a very visible oily sheen to your face. My Pond's brand cream with the same claims goes on smoothly and is absorbed into the skin within a minute or so. This product sits on top, so much so that I use a washcloth to try to wipe it off before applying my makeup.Thirdly, the packaging feels cheap. It is plastic with a metallic-looking plastic lid. They should have made it glass or obviously plastic instead of trying to make it look expensive before you touch it.This is my honest opinion. I hope the product works for someone, but it does not work for me.", "If you can get past the oatmeal smell (my husband says it smells like spackling paste), it works pretty well.  Clearly, it is hard to judge whether a wrinkle cream is working after a month or so but my skin is definitely softer and smoother after using it.  I use it morning and night and it does not make my foundation peel up like a lot of creams do.  It also contains SPF 15 which is great for the winter sun.", "This Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex SPF 15 cream is so luscious and thick that my skin just drinks it in.  Living in Colorado is very drying to our skin and I truly appreciate a good night cream that can also be used during the daytime as well.  Doesn't feel like my pores are clogged - just well loved.  There is little to no fragrance, just a lovely clean smell.  The price tag of $40 plus shouldn't scare you away because it really is worth every bit.", "This has just the perfect amount of oiliness--not so much that it overpowers the experience and just enough to smooth application. The smell disappears and doesn't linger like so many others. It is easy to apply and disappears in second. As for it's age-defying, anti-wrinkle properties I'll have to get back to you on that. I've been using it only for a few weeks so far.", "Like lots of 40ish women I am a bit of a face cream junky.  I have used a lot of different creams that promise to do everything but clean my kitchen.  And we all know that almost none of them live up to their promises.  When I tried Hydroxatone I was already a consistent user of moisturizers and AHA's.  The jar is almost comically small and when you open it, the amount of cream is smaller still.  The smell was not over powering.  The cream did feel a little sticky on my skin but that feeling passed.  Hydroxatone did not improve my skin.  I did not notice improvements in wrinkles, tone, or coloration.  However, I also did not notice my skin getting worse.  This means that Hydroxatone worked as well as my current regimen of creams and AHA serum.  So it's not a bad face cream.  My previous regime was cheaper so I will stick to that.", "I found this cream to be heavy on my skin, and I have yet to notice any results, although I have not used it the full six weeks. The jar is small; 1 ounce.  The first ingredient in this product is water, the second is Sesame Oil.  I think I'll be sticking to my favorite of face creams, Olay Pro X.", "Truely nothing is going to fix the wrinkles.  But this goes on very lightly and keeps skin moisturized and soft all day. It does not bother my eyes at all which is a first. It doesn't take much and there is no greasy feel.  One star off because I am not at all sure it is worth the posted price.  It is one ounce of product, that is two tablespoons, IOW the size of a serving of salad dressing.It did not come with an ingredient list so I'm not sure if it contains precious metals or what but I would be afraid to pay so much for something a child could smear on the mirror in 5 seconds flat.", "I didn't care for this moisturizer that much, works ok, but the smell was a little off for me and I didn't see the miraculous results the ad proclaimed.  I didn't notice much difference in my wrinkles eaither, but then, it will take more than a miracle to overcome the ravages of aging!! Can't blame the product for that. Its an ok moisturizer.", "\"Review of Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex, Sensitive:The manufacturer advertises Hydroxatone as \"\"a multi functional anti-aging powerhouse and moisturizer for those with sensitive skin that softens the appearance of visible lines, wrinkles and crow's feet by helping the skin stimulate the production of collagen. This one product serves as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer and your anti-aging treatment all in one.\"\"  Bold promises that do deliver.  However, although the moisturizing effects of the creme do reduce wrinkle lines (crow's feet), it is a temporary effect lasting approximately 4-6 hours.  It will take more than one jar to experience the long term longitudinal effects.  In short, my wife likes it!  Will purchase more in future.\"", "My mom is a type of person who don't mine going store to store , surfing through the website, and ordering through TV ads to fine the best cream minimizers. She's 56 and is trying to minimize her fine lines and wrinkles. I'm over 35 and have never even touched a wrinkle cream. So I handed this cream to her to fine out what she thinks.  My mom tried Hydroxatone to get rid of her wrinkles and it actually ended up clearing up her dark aging spots after a month, so she recommended that I try it when I feel its ready! Amazing! She's very satisfied with this product so I'll make sure to hold on to this brand. Recommended.", "This cream feels really good and goes on with no problem as a night cream. But as a day cream under foundation it tends to come through and give you a shiny oily look and make your face feel greasy. So I use it at night and there is no oily feeling upon awakening in the morning. As for the anti wrinkle affect it might be more affective if it was an oil-free base where you could utilize it during the daytime but it's not quite there. This might be good for someone that has really dry skin that is not sensitive to the hydroxatone formula. For that reason and for that price I've had better luck with other brands I could use in the daytime that were more economical and when this is gone I think I will switch back to my tried and true good ole standby as I really see no outstanding results from this free trial. Just cannot justify the cost with the effects, or lack of.", "This is a heavier-looking cream moisturizer than the liquid type I'm used to, so I was concerned about clumping and residue if I wore it under foundation or blush. However, the cream is light weight enough to blend in perfectly on the skin while providing thorough hydration. This is great for winter use, when one wants a more effective day cream. It is also useful as a night cream, though I prefer to use the night cream in this product line. A very effective product, feels good going on and hydrates all day, does not interfere with makeup use.", "I've been using this Hydroxatone for a few weeks and sadly I don't look any younger yet - in fact I look a few weeks older since I've been using this product.  In all seriousness, the metrosexual side of me does prompt me to use a face cream daily to at least attempt to slow down the relentless march of Father Time.For me the number one thing I look for in a face cream is SPF protection because the sun is the key ager...this cream has SPF which is good.  Then I look for retinol-type ingredients to hopefully give me some good old fashion bio-chemical skin cell regrowth (hopefully) - from what I can tell this Hydroxatone does not have retinol but more along the lines of organic all natural type ingredients probably derived from various wives tales passed down from the ages of man.  I like face creams that don't make my skin all greasy and oily and being a man I prefer low sheen - I found this Hydroxatone to be a bit on the oily side for my tastes and made my skin a bit too shiny.  Lastly, I like a good value price point since I use a face cream regularly - $40+ is a bit too pricey for me for a product unless it really is turning back the hands of time.So in consideration of above I rate this product 2 stars out of 5 in consideration of my usage needs and price/value.  I'll stick with my Neutrogena for Men at $15 with a nice non-oily, low sheen experience.", "I won't be buying this for myself.I've tried several different wrinkle creams.  This one was slightly greasy and made my skin develop a lot of little pimples.Just to be fair, I'm going to try it again to make sure it was the cream that caused the pimples.  But I'm sure it was.  I don't have oily skin and rarely get pimples.I can't recommend it.", "I usually use Olay products (Regenerist) and have found that I really like how they work on my skin. But the idea of trying a product for three times the price to see if it makes a three times difference was too good to pass up.The product goes on easy and disappears fairly quickly. I often have trouble with creams burning my eyes, no matter how careful I am about applying them nearby. I had no trouble with this cream at all. It never bothered my eyes.I can say that I feel some of my finer wrinkles have softened but I also think that the skin on my face has plumped ever so slightly which is what has decreased the appearance of wrinkles. I guess that's what this is supposed to do though - add enough long lasting moisture to make the wrinkles fill in a bit.But no matter what, I can't get past the price. It's a lot of money to spend on a deceivingly small container. If you look at it carefully, the only part that has the cream is a small section in the middle. The outer blue flare of the jar is just for show and the lid is meant to look really thick but the amount of cream is one ounce.So while I think the product has done a good job, I think there are other products that do a close enough or similar job for a more affordable price.", "Been using now for a month- I feel my skin is tighter. I like the consistency of this product- Very light and my skin absorbs well.. Doesn't have any SPF so I use a BB Cream on top but very impressed with this product as well as the entire Hydroxatone line. Works great with my Sensitive skin!", "I have been using this for approximately two weeks now.  My face has held in more moisture with this 10-30 degree weather than with any other lotion I have tried so far.  It's light and creamy, I love it's texture.  It's not greasy and rubs into the skin beautifully.  It seems to fill in locations when you first apply it.  I haven't seen a diminshed look on any of my face wrinkles yet.  I am hopeful byt the time I finish the container I will have some improvement in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.", "I have very sensitive skin that is also oily so when I saw this product especially made for my skin type, I decided to try it. While I have had no reactions to the anti-wrinkle complex, which is great, I am not sure about it minimizing my wrinkles. However, I have only been using a week, so will check back and update.UPDATE: I have seen no visible reduction of wrinkles in the 3 weeks I have been using it. Other, less expensive products out there work better.", "\"This review is for the AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for sensitive skin.  I'm not sure why all the Hydroxatone reviews are being lumped together as the different formulations vary significantly.This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer with a non-greasy feel.  It absorbs into the skin within seconds and leaves my face feeling moisturized but without any kind of \"\"sticky\"\" feel to it.  I can apply make-up almost immediately after using this moisturizer in the morning and it does not affect how well my make-up wears throughout the day.  This provides the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin (mostly normal with a tendency to get oily in the t-zone).  With that in mind, I doubt this would be rich enough for dry/very dry skins.Some things to consider:*Sensitive formula does not contain sunscreen*non-scented*may not provide enough moisture for dry/very dry skinHere's the product claim that's printed on the side of the box:  \"\"...help reduce the appearance of a wide range of wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of the skin\"\".  That's a pretty modest claim, which I actually appreciate.  No miracle anti-aging claims here.  Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable when the skin is temporarily \"\"plumped up\"\" by moisturizers, and this one does contain Hyaluronic Acid (a known plumping ingredient).Overall I was very pleased with this product.  It's convenient to have one moisturizer that can be used for both AM and PM, and I prefer my skin care products without sunscreen - who needs a night cream that contains sunblock?  My one complaint:  I really don't care for the `jar' packaging.  I'm sure it's used because it makes it seem like you're getting far more than just 1 oz. of product, but I don't like having to stick my fingers into the jar to scoop out the product; it's easy to spread bacteria that way.  I would definitely purchase this again.\"", "Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Cream is a fairly heavy moisturizing day and night cream that contains SPF 15 sunscreen.  It did sting a bit when applied near my eyes. It did not irritate my skin, and it did not cause any breakouts. The cream absorbs quickly and is not too heavy to be worn under foundation.  I found the cream to be about the same as most good moisturizers.  I did not see any big difference in my skin, but it did do a good job of softening my skin.", "Ever been tempted to buy some really compelling 'new' product 'as seen on TV?  I have.  With two exceptions (very cheap $10 ones) they were fairly worthless.  Some years ago, I was sorely tempted to get something, and knew its purchase would make a major dent in my budget.  I googled it, and found, of course, some pithy critiques. After that, I never made a buying decision without researching a bit. More recently, however, the companies themselves have managed to make use of those websites.  Now if you google 'hydroxacut reviews' you will find links that suggest they include negative and positive reviews, but you won't find a negative review.  You'll find instead rousing testimonials that rival those of the infomercials.  Even Consumer Reports can be bought.Amazon, on the other hand, features most everything offered anywhere else, on television or off.  Its customers give you the real 'skinny' on whether the product is worth its costs or not.  It's a bit confusing that this particular product is offered at so many price points, but I do like the reviews, and I find Amazon's customers much more credible than tv actors or voice-overs. Thanks to all of you for your many considered opinions.  You've saved me thousands over the years! Amazon is an impressive vendor, and its customers are even moreso.", "I am using this as a daytime moisturizer and sunscreen, and, so far, I love it.  It stings a bit when it goes on, so I expect that it probably has some retinol or something similar in it.  The smell is also a little strong, but it fades immediately.As soon as I put it on it plumps up the little lines and wrinkles, and the sunscreen works very well.  No cream is ever going to replicate the results you will get with dermal fillers or surgery, but this will make your skin look and feel softer and will prevent sun damage.I checked the ingredients on the Good Guide for any health concerns and found that two are of medium concern and one is of low concern.  The one most people will probably be most familiar with is propylene glycol, which is in lots and lots of food and cosmetic products.  Another one that is also in just about every anti-aging cream you're going to find is triethanolamine, which, as I understand it, is an alcohol base.  If you have known sensitivities to these ingredients, this is not the cream for you (and probably no other generally available anti-aging product is going to be, either).All of the ingredients - all of them - are disclosed on the packaging, so, if you're like me and can have sensitivities to ingredients that never ever seem to bother anybody else, you will be able to find out about them before you buy the stuff and put it on your face.I recommend this product.  I am still -ahem- 50 years old when I look in the mirror, but my skin looks good for my age and feels soft.", ". . . After using this for a short time, it's hard to tell if it works or not, but I was eager to try this product.  I'd seen it advertised on TV and it sounds good.  It is light and nongreasy - I like it for those attributes.  Whether or not it will improve my skin probably won't be known for a time, but I'm willing to give it a try.  It does have an SPF of 15 and that's always good.", "My regular facial moisturizer isOlay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging DNA Superstructure UV Cream SPF 30, 1.7 Ounceand have been happy with it but I was curious to try something different. I got this because I liked the SPF coverage and liked that it was unscented.Now others have noted that they couldn't stand the smell, which admittedly is very different. I think people get accustomed to fragrance being in beauty products that when they finally encounter something without fragrance and the natural smells come through, it turns them off. But in my case, I was not turned off. I actually liked that it had no fragrance added.My first impressions were: The bottle was small. So very small. For so much money you get 1 oz of product. Comparable creams, such as Avon's Anew and my Olay Regenerist give you 1.7 oz. So you're getting quite a bit less here. Upon opening the jar, the cream turned out to be thick and goes on easily. You need very little to moisturize your entire face.After two weeks of use, I've been pleased. I'm Asian and my facial coloring is not even. I've noticed that this has evened out my skin tone and makes my face look more.... luminescent? Radiant? Maybe those aren't the right words. My face doesn't actually glow but my features do look brighter. I feel more fresh-faced. My skin is also incredibly soft and I just love how it feels. In regards to wrinkles, I am not sure. My problem area is my forehead where I have fine lines. Those lines are still there and I don't think they've changed. To be fair, I have only been using it for two weeks so maybe it takes more time.The bottom line is that this cream is hands down better than the one I was using before.
