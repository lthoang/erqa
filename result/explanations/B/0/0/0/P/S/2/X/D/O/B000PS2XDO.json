Obviously this is dependent on how powerful of a computer you have. I have read that this games is pretty demanding as far as the PC version is concerned. I was able to run the game on ultra, everything fully maxed with no less that 60fps. The story was actually pretty good, it was unique in some areas which to be honest, can be difficult to find in games. The gameplay was fun too, its a little bit different from many first person shooters because the game is focused primarily on stealth. You cant just run through your opponents blowing them away, you have to be cautious and stealthy for 90% of the game which is fun but can be tedious at times. I didn't run into hardly any problems. One that did give me a hard time was a helicopter that you HAVE to shoot down to continue on. It is a pretty common glitch on a mission after you blow up a battleship. The stupid helicopter just flies around way up where you can barely see it, literally in the stratosphere of the game. So if anyone runs into this, you can just shoot it down with a rocket launcher, its a little bit difficult but was a better option in my opinion than restarting that entire mission. That didn't ruin the game or anything, just a minor glitch. Overall I loved the game!My Computer:NZXT Guardian 921 Case (4 fans)asus p8z68v-pro/gen3 motherboardintel i7 2600k CPUcorsair vengeance 8GB ram 1600mhzSeagate barracuda 2TB 7200 rpm hddCooler master CPU coolerCooler master silent pro gold 1200W power supplydual EVGA GTX 570 sliAsus cd/dvd rw disk drive", "Crysis is...well, Crysis, I have never played a game like it.Pros - Gorgeous graphics, environments are highly interactive, playing the game is alot of fun, customizable weapons, a very usefull nanosuit.Cons - NEED A SUPERCOMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!Touch on the last part, if you have a very good computer and are a fan of the FPS genre, then do not hesitate to get this game.My new gaming PC had some problems running this game on high/very high settings @ 1280x1024 with 2xAA.My computer specs are:Nvidia 780i motherboardIntel Q9650 @ 3.40 GhzNvidia 280 GTX (Overclocked)4GBs of RAM @ 800 MhzIf you have a moderate PC then you can run this game, but be advised, the framerate is very inconsistant. If your PC barely meets the minimum speculations, forget about this game until you have a new computer.SingleplayerThe singleplayer in Crysis is the products main feature. It takes about 12 - 15 hours depending on the difficulty of play. The singleplayer is highly replayable because of the open level design. Crysis looks to set itself apart by its level design. You are not hauled down one hallway or specific path in this game, instead you are thrown into a sandbox where you can approach your objective as you see fit.Another thing I like is the fact that the weapons are customizable. You can attach scopes, silencers, grenade launchers, lazer sights, flashlights, and even use differt types of amnunition. I ended up turning each of my weapons into somewhat of a sniper rifle, picking off soldiers at a distance.The nanosuit is also a neat mechanic of the game. It has the settings of armor (soaks up damage from enemies), cloak (makes you invisible), speed (the use of this is obvious), and strength (allows super high jumps, super damaging punches, my personal favorite: throwing random things into enemys, or even picking them up). It further allows you to play the way you wish.Finally, the AI in this game is quite good. They know how to use cover, and take cover when being shot at. They try also to outmanuver you. Though sometimes there are problems, overall the AI is good.MultiplayerIf you are buying Crysis for the multiplayer, buy Crysis: Warhead instead. The multiplayer has only five maps, and while it is very fun. It seems hindered by the small amount of maps. Crysis: Warhead, on the other hand has 26 maps, but its singleplayer is disappointing. It comes down to what you want in a game.Graphics - 10/10Gameplay - 10/10Sound - 8/10Multiplayer - 8/10Value - 9/10OVERALL - 9.5/10 - Outstanding", "i really liked the game a lot most of the time. But some how after the alien space floating; i lost totaly intreast in the action.looked stupid to me. Played the game on medium setting on a dual core Quad g-force 8600GT.It was fine. to bad the aliens turned out that boring.", "- The multiplayer interface is what I bought this game for- Multiple weapons to choose from- Fairly easy to get into game servers- Voice communication over a headset was pretty good-Graphics were considered the best ever made when this came out, but I didn't find them to be top notch any longer- Overall for the Amazon download price (which is MUCH MUCH cheaper than a retail store) its a pretty good game.", "try and get this game to work in Vista, I dare you.with 3gb memory, an 8800 GTS video card, and the game looks like Quake back in 1995... what the hell is going on ???  No patch, no support, no help.. go  to hell if you think I'm recommending this turd to my friends. PUARFS!", "\"Wanna know something funny?I was going to title this review \"\"airheaded,\"\" because that's my one-word summation of the game.But in a moment of absent-mindedness, when trying to get to THIS page, I accidentally typed \"\"airheaded\"\" into the Amazon search engine, rather than \"\"Crysis.\"\"The spooky thing is that, at least as of the date of this writing, when you type in \"\"airheaded\"\" into Amazon's search engine, \"\"Crysis Maximum Edition\"\" is the first search result returned!  Like Amazon was reading my mind.Or, more realistically, I can't be the only guy thinking that this game is a little short on, uh, pabulum.  Not that a first person Armageddon-style shoot 'em up is supposedly to be heavily intellectual; it's just that we've seen this so many times before:  you go around shooting a whole bunch of monsters, gradually acquiring more and more powerful weapons until basically you're fighting Satan himself at the end.Good stuff!  Classic.  But there's not a twist in sight here, it's just the same ol' same ol'.And it seems like they could have even thought out the brainless butchery a little better:1.  The first section has you tromping through the jungle wasting a bunch of Asians.  What innovation!2.  The second second is, admittedly, trippy.  It involves floating through a Jefferson Airplane-style alien mothership.  Promising, but brief.3.  Guess what happens in the final section?  You've seen it a million times before.  Only here your final adversary is so close and the camerawork is so shaky that you can hardly tell what's going on.In short, nothing new to offer.  Awfully stable engine, though.\"", "\"I want to start by saying, \"\"Next company that makes a game without an ending gets a crowbar to the face.\"\"  That aside, I found this to be a very good first person shooter as games go.The game looks good.  It seems that this game is the newest release by the company CryTech.  You may recall a previous title by the name Far Cry, yeah same people.  Crysis makes use of a new gaming engine (CryEngine 2) and is one of the new \"\"Next Gen\"\" games available for both XP and Vista and blah blah blah.  Essentially, you can count on it to put your video card in a hammerlock and clock you processor to next week as you play.  From what I have seen, this game is built for platforms which may not even exist yet.  Not to say that you can't play it on a less than brand new machine, you simply may not enjoy it as much.  For reference, I played through with a Intel Core Duo 2.4, Nvidia 8800 GTS and 2 gigs of ram, without any problems.The game itself is great.  Set in the not so distant future (2020) you are a special ops soldier sent into an island somewhere in the south China sea.  Originally sent to fight Koreans and rescue some scientists, things get very odd very fast.  For more plot check out Wikipedia, but let me assure you it is far more gratifying than the plot of most shooters out there (namely Timeshift).The interface of the game works well.  I didn't have to play with a single config, control or setting throughout the entire game.  I find it is always nice to find my buttons, video and sound settings right where I need them from the start.The only real concept that causes this game to differ from others is the use of the nanosuit.  Essentially, it is a set of superpowered battle armor you get the joy of using.  For short intervals, it can cloak you, speed you up, give you super strength or simply defend you.  This sounded cool from the start, but quickly degenerated into using the same function over and over again as the difficulty of your enemy is amped up to compensate for you powers.Example: I decide to give myself a bit of super strength to rush up and pound some poor sap into the ground.  Result:  I am blasted to death before I make it five feet or I find that I am trying to fight the loosing side of a brawl between Halle Berry and a bull elephant.  So scratch that power for any reason other than jumping really high.I was pretty much stuck cloaking myself, running until my battery went dead, then hiding and recharging.  This process is repeated until you get  close enough to actually hit someone with that wildly gyrating rifle you have been trying to aim for the last hour.This was my experience on normal skill, which oscillated from pointlessly easy to total unthinking rage against all living things.  I would assume that things get only worse on hard, your enemies also stop speaking English on hard for some reason.  So, if you are worried about playing an unbalanced game, stop there.  This game is nicely balanced against you in every way.  Recoil makes any rapid fire attempt laughable and a \"\"realistic\"\" figure 8 sway pattern makes timing a sniper shot a minigame all in its own.The only shortcoming I had with this game was the length (about 10 hours give or take 2 depending on your anger threshold).  Now I understand it is the new thing for developers to get lazy and release games in episodes in order to guarantee future income as well as cut down on development costs (just release the second half years later and call it Episode 2, stupid Valve) but I am getting really tired of paying for demos.Overall, I have to give this game good ratings.  It plays nicely, it keeps you interested and it looks amazing.  But after reaching the end you are left flailing in confusion as to what the heck ever happened to the idea of a conclusion.  I notice that CryTech has plans for a FarCry 2 but I haven't heard anything for a Crysis 2 yet so it may be a while before anyone gets closure.  Great, all of a month after release and I am yelling for a sequel, or at least the second half of my game.\"", "of the fundamental difference between PC and console games/gaming. At least it used to be but now most PC games seem to be not much, if any better than the junk they shovel out for consoles.I had this a while back and had forgotten how good it was barring a few cheap shots by the developers. It downloaded fine and works fine on my Windows 7 64bit. Not sure why so many people are having problems with that but it starts and plays just fine for me. One thing I did notice and have read about in the forums before is that for some reason the fan on my graphics card doesn't turn up when it starts getting hot. Not sure why this is and I'm not alone with it either but turning it up manually before starting the game works okay.I actually like the alien twist to the story that shows up later. Don't mind the swarms too much either which is something that usually turns me completely off of any video game that uses them. I think it's an extremely cheap and overused method of adding content to a video game. I'll tell you one thing I absolutely hate in this game and that's the VTOL aircraft. The very first time you ever fly this thing you're immediately faced with a swarm of alien ships that you have to shoot down... as they are shooting at you. To me, this is pure stupidity but it's about the only significant shortcoming, in my opinion,  that the game has.There are some bugs but not many. Probably the worst is the occasional failure to load the next objective pointer or acknowledge on the list that you have completed the last one. It'll give you the objective and it's location on the map (usually) but no directional indicator and it won't fade out the objective you've just completed, making you think there is something left to do. Kinda confusing to explain it and it doesn't happen often, usually only after you've rescued the first hostage early in the game and then it'll quit. If it happens to you, you'll see what I mean but just ignore it and head sort of east southeast to a waterfall and continue on with the game. Once you reach the next objective area it'll go ahead and fix itself.So, the game is very good and eventhough it's a few years old now the graphics quality is probably the best available in any PC game to date and the overall quality - voice acting, physics, AI, etc. is all top shelf programming. You're going to need a fairly good system to run it though. You definitely don't need a custom gaming rig (haven't seen a game yet that made owning one worth the cost) but you can forget using a low end card and weak processor for anything but the worst, probably unplayable performance.Just don't forget about that GPU fan issue.", "I am a FPS fanatic. I have played just about every game for Windows. I love the new generation of games always looking for a unique angle (Bioshock, FEAR, etc). Crysis is a very entertaining shooter with three stages -- each with its own personality. The gameplay is great. I love how I could drive and use just about anything. The tank level alone is worth the price (I paid $15). Graphics were outstanding. And with most games anymore, the AI was great. I would rank this game right up there with Bioshock and Far Cry as two of the best FPS games (Half-Life is still the king).However, one issue -- I am not a big multiplayer fan -- I typically play a game's multiplayer once or twice to check it out, then that is it. I don't like just running around shooting -- I need a little plot and objective. I could never get the multiplayer to work. I checked online and found this to be a fairly common issue. I have Vista and have never had a problem with any game -- but the multiplayer would never launch -- I kept getting an error. Other than that issue, I highly recommend this game.", "\"After reading and hearing the hype this game was getting, I decided to check it out for myself. I actually upgraded my computer with a new GeForce 8800 GT just for the event. Like most games I jump into, I didn't know much about it so I wouldn't oversell myself on the game. All I knew is that the physics and the graphics were superior to none. That they are. But sometimes, graphics can't make the game more than what it is: a basic sci-fi shooter.For starters, the story line is generic. It's what every game has been doing these days. Aliens are unleashed, causing havoc, you take out their HQ, find out that you need to \"\"finish the fight\"\", cliffhanger ending. I hate cliffhanger endings, but I will say, at least we didn't get a \"\"To be continued...\"\" generic ending like Rainbow 6: Vegas. The ending of this game is more like the Marvel movies. They tell you right at the end that there will be another game. Can we please do something more original? It's the 21st century! The story puts you in the role of a soldier from the US, taking out Koreans on one of their islands. Upon traveling through their land, you begin to notice strange crafts flying around, even capturing one of your squad members (who actually do nothing in the game aside from talk to you). The rest I can't really reveal because it may ruin it for some, but you'll have the same \"\"I knew that was coming...\"\" as you would in any Halo game.The first few missions are probably the best in the game, aside from one of the last missions. You really get to experience what the designers put into the game. One of the biggest things in the game is the ability to pick up random items from the ground and tables. There's almost unlimited ability to what you can pick up. This really isn't a revolutionary feature, as an older, much more generic shooter did this in the 90's called Trespasser. It wasn't the best game, but it's feature of hurling a rock that you found on the ground or a stick and hurling it at a raptor was all fun. The problem with Crysis' items is the lack of really. There's a dozen items you can pick up ranging from broken garbage, barrels (those generic things used in every shooter), and animals. There's also a lot of generic items inside Korean huts, such as fruit or bottles. It's a nice feature, but really hardly used in the game for a purpose other than a certain \"\"wow\"\" effect. For instance, when you're in the middle of the game, you'll almost have deja vu on how much of the stuff is the same, like the one hut you'll run into several times through the game. It's the hut that is fun to blow up but after a few times of blowing up the only hut in the game, it loses that coolness effect. Maybe next time, we'll get two or three huts and houses to blow away.The graphics are outstanding, but at a very steep price. The game is a powerhouse of a game and you're really lucky (or rich) to have the game with everything running on Very High with 30 frames per second. PC Gamer claims that games have been doing this for a while, and it just means that the game wasn't meant to be running at full graphics at this time. Well, that's fine and dandy but after you beat the game a few times, you probably won't care about it afterwards. (I'll explain later). If you don't mind setting the graphics (or at least just the shaders) to medium, then the game should run outstanding with very little choppy frames. The game on medium looks fantastic and is something to really be admired. One of the best graphical features in the game is the water effects. They're absolutely stunning, especially with the settings set to the highest. Water flying through the air and hitting the bloom effects in the game create a realistic rainbow effect that is just wonderful to look at. The trees at really good looking too. Throwing a grenade in a mix of them will cause the most realistic looking effect on the way the tree moves around that I've ever seen. As far as character models and such, the game is top notch.AI is one of the big problems in the game. At first they seem really smart, but once you master the suit you wear, you'll quickly find out that jumping into the invisible mode is basically the best option for crowded combat. You can jump in and out of it so fast that it quickly confuses the enemies, making them just as dumb as a game from the early 90's, if that. Some of the aliens you fight toward the end are so dumb, you literally can run right past them in some of the difficulties. I'm not sure why critics have been saying this game revolutionized the AI, because it really didn't. It's about as well done as Call of Duty 4, being it's a little too easy to outsmart your enemies. Really, really easy. Speaking of the suit, though, that is probably the best feature of the game. It actually gives you a strategy on how you're going to go at something.The mulitplayer is fun, although it's the same as Far Cry. The maps are well designed and the combat gets really intense at times. Overall, it's just the same thing we've been doing, but with better graphics. The one really big letdown is the lack of object physics in the multiplayer. I'd have lover to hurl bananas at my foes for that No One Lives Forever humor. Crysis is pretty cool for a show and effects of what we can do, but with it's generic story and horrible AI, I can't see this game revolutionized the gaming industry. Pretty graphics are not revolutionary unless they do something for you. BioShock revolutionized story telling; Half-Life 2 revolutionized physics... what did Crysis really do aside from show us that our computers need some new upgrades? I really hope that the team works harder on Far Cry 2 and puts out a terrific game with beautiful graphics and a top-notch multiplayer.Also, DRM.\"", "A lot have been said about this great game. The feeling I get while playing this incredible game is that I am some kind of Predator but for good cases. I mean, there is nothing sweeter than killing a foe with your invisibility cloak engaged or jumping high with the maximum strength feature of your suit or running lightning fast with the maximum speed feature. This is the most close to real of any RECENT game as feeling like being a Predator like soldier is.", "No one has mentioned that this game is copy protected by securom that that will install a virus on your hard drive you can NOT remove.Also because there is limited game play anyone would be a fool to buy it used.So much for reselling it on amazon.I sure won't buy one used or not.This whole limited play thing is designed so you can not resell the game.WHAT A RIP OFF.", "This game is finally playable in maxed out mode with my current high end hardware. My pc is full gaming rig and runs it well. I remember when it came out, It would not play well at all on my cool gaming rig of the time. Now it does, years later and it is awsome. Not some stupid console port! A real computer game for real computer gamers. Now I already know what all the console fan bois are going to say, so dont waste our time on this PC review. Most real pc gamers dont even care what console gamers think, period. It simply is not comparable. THis game has great action, great weapons, fun driving and swimming. I really cheered when I shot my first heli down. It is cheap too! I am running gtx 470 video, i7 socket 1366 on x58 with triple channel ddr3 and all ssd system. It rocks and looks fantastic. Cheers!", "Hi all! If you've ever read some of my other reviews, you know I'm a hard core action, adventure, FPS type of gamer. I loved Far Cry and have been waiting patiently (and I'm not a patient man) for a sequel. Well, this is it. Yep! I got the demo and it looks every bit as good as Far Cry. The thing that is really cool about Far Cry AND this game, is that you can interact with the entire environment, you can take your own path throughout the game and you can just plain have fun. You actually feel like you're IN the game. The graphics, as in Far Cry, are excellent and the environments are realistic and a blast to play in. You can shoot down all the palm trees you want, shoot the buildings to pieces and have a general blast playing psycho killer. No, I haven't purchased the game yet. I plan to though. This one is worth every cent, just as Far Cry was. I highly recommend this game to all those fellow FPS fans out there. You won't go wrong with this one. Now, make another and another. Love these games!", "\"Using the powerful CryTek engine, the First-Person Shooter \"\"Crysis\"\" provides a graphical treat, decent gameplay, and some neat ideas.In Crysis, you play as a member of an American special forces unit in North Korea. Equipped with a nano-technological supersuit, you have to use your abilities and your wits to move through hostile territory and uncover the reason behind the North Koreans' recent hostile movements. Your supersuit provides most of the game's gameplay. It can switch between Maximum Armor, Maximum Strength, Maximum Speed, and a Cloak mode. Every mode uses up recharging energy to do its job; Maximum Armor blocks damage until its energy runs out, Maximum Strength can punch down small houses and kill soldiers in a single hit, Maximum Speed lets you sprint at gazelle-like speed, and Cloak makes you invisible and lasts longer if you stay still.Of course, it's easy to assume that with all these abilities, you'd be an unstoppable death machine. In reality, you're more like a somewhat above-average regular person. The different abilities are more useful when used intelligently; Armor, for example, can only block four or five bullets, and speed only provides super-fast speed in bursts of a few seconds. Therefore, the game lies not in simply overpowering your enemies, but using your abilities well. However, the game still does a good job of making you feel powerful - there's nothing quite as neat as jumping over a wall, then killing the guard on the other side with a single punch. Creative use of your powersWhile the variety of guns isn't particularly great (the standard FPS assortment of assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, and so on), the real appeal of the guns lies in customization options. Each gun can take a variety of scopes, laser sights, silencers, and grenade launchers. The run-and-gun action in the game is reasonably fun, but as mentioned, it's better to play Smarter than Harder. The guns don't handle particularly well, and it's possible to hit an enemy 10 times in the chest without killing him, or hit him once in the head and have him die.The graphics in the game are its main attraction; the open maps consisting mostly of jungle environments look great and feel immersive, with near-realistic trees and grass. The huge maps and lush lighting effects complement the great feeling of the game. This is one of those games that people buy when they've just bought a top-of-the-line computer and want to show off what it can do. The sound design isn't that great, but it's serviceable.Overall, Crysis is a fun game, and if you've got a computer that can run it, then it's definitely worth picking up. The one major problem in gameplay is the twist near the end of the game. Not a simple storyline alteration, the twist results in a major change of gameplay. Overall, however, the game is fun and rewards creative thinking, a rarely-seen trait in most modern games.Rating: 9/10.\"", "\"The short version is that this is the best shooter I ever played.The longer version is that especially during the first half of the game, this provides an unprecedented experience. The graphics are great. The game play is great. There is not a frustrating moment in sight. Immersion is awesome. I never had as much of a feeling of \"\"being there\"\". Vehicles drive great. It is an experience you want to go on and on...Unfortunately, the whole thing gets visible worse in the later part of the game, once you get inside the alien compound. First, you have no ammo, as you go through one of the most disorienting levels I ever played. So you end up literally punching the aliens if you happen to start out the level wrong.Once you get out of there, things get chaotic and you just kinda blow your way through without much aiming. Then you get to a flying sequence that is borderline broken, the thing is so unresponsive. Aliens are flying around you, and it takes you 20 seconds to turn your ship around. Not fun. (A patch made this a little better but it is still like a low-budget, awful game mixed in for no real reason other than making the game longer perhaps). All of a sudden, random tornadoes creep up behind you and suck you in and there is nothing you can do about it. (And it will probably take you 5 or 10 attempts before you even realize what is going on. At first you think it is just random crashes).In the later levels, the game also tends to leave you without much guidance or even misguidance. At one point you need to walk into a chamber. Over your comm system you hear \"\"can your suit handle this level of radiation?\"\", which your character confidently answers \"\"yes it will\"\". So you walk in, and - whack - you are dead. Too much radiation. What the...?!?Luckily, the game automatically saves often and at fair spots. In addition, you can go to the menu and save anywhere you want. I felt that that was a great system. You don't quick-save all the time, but if you really do end up at a spot where you wish you could save yourself, you can.I should also mention that the game crashes a lot, even with patch 1.2. I must have experienced 10+ blue-screens playing this game as well as a number of crashes to the desktop. I am not sure why, but it seems that is one characteristic that all German games share. Where is that German engineering?!? (I can say this, because I am from Europe myself :-)This is still a great game and I had a blast. With better quality control and the game play fun staying up in the last 3rd of the game, this would have been a 5-star game no questions asked. As things stand, with the last parts of the game I remember having been bad, I am tempted to give it 3 stars, but 4 is more appropriate overall.\"", "Crysis is easily the best game ever made.Graphics are AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. A lot of people whining because their spec is four years old. That isn't acceptable now. Get with the times. My mid-spec machine runs it in on Very High, 1440x900 resolution, with only water turned down to medium and Volumetric Lighting at High. I get between 25-40fps which is amazing and it looks like a dream. The cut scenes were going at 15fps and a couple of places in-game but I accept my machine isn't high spec.Use of sound is also brilliant. Screw the potato guns of UT3, Crysis has the best weapons.The story is amazing. Characters are decent. Action is AWESOME in every sense - 100%. The game lets YOU decide how YOU play. If you don't like stealth and want to go in guns blazing so be it. Or you can kill every enemy in the level and then demolish their buildings. Did I mention the physics are the best ever? I destroyed three buildings by throwing a barrel through them. Owned.Don't take notice of these whingers who are still using the family PC bought in 2000, this is the real deal.", "Man, what a disappointment.  I, like so many of us die hard PC shooter addicts loved Far Cry and was waiting for this release. Heck, I pre-orderd this from Amazon in the Summer!!!  And boy, what a let down.The first part I felt like I was replaying Far Cry, maybe an updated version, but the same basic island setting, similar weapons, vehicles, etc.  Then I got into the tank battle part, and this was highly derivative of the hover tanks in Quake 4.  I kept spacing out and thinking I was in Quake 4.But then, I got to the middle part, where you're inside this mountain, and it was blatant RIPOFF of Prey.  The whole thing.  Floating in this 3 dimensional space, no gravity, similar type gameplay, and hugely pointless.  There was no story.  It was just a pain to get through, cuz nothing really happened.  You shoot these things.  Then nothing.Then I got to the ice planet part, and this was somewhat interesting, for the first 3 minutes.  Then it too, became boring and repetitive.  Hugely so.  The flying blue things are totally annoying.  The weapons are simply lousy, even the alien weapon is basically useless (it overheats in like 4 seconds and doesn't actually kill anything that quickly)All in all, what a huge letdown.  The Crytek guys spent lots of time on the detailed environment that they became famous for with Far Cry.  And the first part was similar.  The nanosuit was somewhat novel, but it too ends up being useless because it runs out of power every few seconds.This is not what I had hoped for.  I made it through the game, but I'm not sure I'll go back for another run through.  Just too boring and repetitive.", "\"I've always been more of a console gamer than a PC gamer, but with how hyped Crysis has been over the past year, gamers of all sorts (myself included) were eagerly anticipating it, considering the bombardment of beautiful trailers and gameplay clips that we've seen over all that time, and the fact that the game is developed by Crytek, the same team that brought us the excellent FPS Far Cry.  Once you get Crysis fired up (hope you have a system and graphics card powerful enough to do it), you'll be amazed at how stunningly beautiful the environments and areas appear, even on a low resolution.  The explosion effects are brilliant and the sound effects are wonderfully done as well, making Crysis one of most visually pleasing FPS' to come out in quite some time.  Where Crysis derails though is thanks to the assortment of bugs and glitches that are apparent throughout the game.  These range from physics glitches to mission bugs where you are wandering around wondering just what to do.  It should also be noted that the supposed \"\"advanced AI\"\" in the game is practically non-existant, as you'll notice enemies doing things not so intelligent in the heat of battle, at least when it comes to the human enemies in the game.  These range from shooting in the opposite direction of you to not shooting at all.  However, there are moments in the game where you will be left with your jaw hanging open, including some battles with massive alien adversaries that are done exquisitely well, but these moments happen nowhere near as often as advertised.  Crysis isn't a bad game one bit, and for FPS fans seeking a new shooter or for those who have been marginally interested in the game since it's announcement, it is definitely worth checking out.  Keeping that in mind, don't expect the next great shooter, or nothing close to what Crysis has been hyped as being.\"", "\"FAR CRY was one of the best FPS games ever sold. It created such a following that can only be compared to that of UNREAL and the original HALF-LIFE. CRYTEK, the developer of both FAR CRY and CRYSIS, clearly did not rest on its laurels. CRYSIS is an *EVEN BETTER GAME* in many aspects.And toping FAR CRY is NOT an easy task...Graphically the game is GORGEOUS! (Both DX10 and DX9 compatible). Moving in the jungle is just unbelievable: the natural foliage, the game of light and shadow, the clear flowing water...The weapons are exceptionally well designed (familiar shapes but mostly futuristic) and their muzzle flashes add to the game realism. Replenishing your ammo is almost never a problem, provided you are frugal with your snipper bullets. A nice cross-genre touch: most weapons are enhanceable with targeting-lasers, sniper-sights and silencers.The \"\"weapon\"\" you will enjoy more is, of course, the nanite-muscle-suit, a kind of augmenting exoskeleton that serves as both armor and turning you into a super-human. Throwing your enemies over the tree tops can be really fun - and their limp movements and shouted insults are totally realistic! Speaking of realism, wait to reach the zero-gravity levels: the weapons' kick will propel you backwards - as it should! And, very important, all these great graphics with steep yet not exorbitant system requirements! CRYSIS is much more stable than, say, FEAR-PERSEUS MANDATE or BIOSHOCK, although graphically clearly superior.The sound has also been well worked on. There are a number of moments where sound clues are the warning you will get. The sound of an enemy crawling towards you is not a good omen...So get rid of those old headphones and plug in a good set of speakers.The levels are beautifully designed and the AI PHENOMENAL! I had a group of enemies flank me as I was engaged with their comrade who was left as bait! Shoot an enemy from cover only to watch him seek cover as well - until he or one of his comrades spot your position!Overall, the gameplay controls is very similar to that of FAR CRY (and most FPS nowadays). I do have to point out that movement is precise and effective. Running is fast whereas crouching is stealthy. For longer distances, vehicles become available.The game also sports a multiplayer - although it may require lowering the video specs to avoid lagging.Now, this game (being an EA release) sports ...SecuROM. Usually I subtract at least two stars from games burdening us with such dangerous security routines. However, I liked the game so much I felt torn - and decided to make an exception. So, if you are boycotting SecuROM games, be warned, otherwise:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\"", "Crysis is from the makers of FarCry. It uses a very similar engine, island design and science-fiction type atmosphere to produce what has to be one of the top edge-of-your-seat frenzied blasters ever. You play platoon member Nomad who wears a special Nano suit that gives him extraordinary powers such as maximum armour, strength and speed that allow him to behave in superhuman ways as he is sent to a mysterious island to find out why the local militia has started a hotbed of fighting over something unexplained from another dimension. Cue lots of mowing down trees with high calibre rifles to floating around inside extraterrestrial spacecraft trying to pick off shark-like aliens.Crysis is a two part FPS starting off with island village raids, developing into full scale war maps to eventually become a science-fiction deep space boss beating battler. While it may start off a bit slow as the story progresses (and your guns get bigger) it takes some interesting turns and the graphics and virtually film-like in places. The design inside of the alien ship has to be best level design for any game, ever. In fact like FarCry it is the island and the spaceship that are the stars.While Crysis is simply a must have for any FPS fan, especially those who enjoyed FarCry, it does have some failings. The first is that the graphics are so overkill even on a high-end machine with the latest tech you will not be able to run some parts on anything more than medium settings, especially the cut scenes and the end boss battle. Even on a quad-core with an 8800 card only SLI will stand a chance at greater than medium settings for certain parts. So quite simply many people will not be able to play Crysis and no one has played it on the very highest settings because those PCs are not on the market. The other failing is that for some reason the first quarter of the game is quite boring as you just seem to be raiding village after village doing the same stuff over and over again. It takes a few levels, maybe 4, before Crysis actually kicks in.All in all this is a well made FPS game with lots of new ideas, many features to come to terms with and replay value. FPS lovers shouldn't hold back on trying to play Crysis, the question is if the world was really ready for it but when it will be Crysis will go down as a game that showed that there are no limits to how the FPS can evolve.Pros:GraphicsThe islandThe alien shipGuns and Nano suitCons:High spec requirements are beyond even the best of PCsBoring 1st quarterAI underperformance at times", "This game looks nice but is infected with SecuRom to the point it cause my DVD drive to knock badly. I did a net search and I am not alone with this issue. EA games does not care, they already got my cash.Get STALKER 1 & 2 patch them (They are buggy without the patches) and they are way better anyway.", "\"System:  Dell XPS 410Duel Core E66002gb RAMNvidia 640 mb 8800 GTSI was actually somewhat disappointed in this game, I hate to say.  I looked forward to this for over a year.First the good.  Graphics are very good even with the low to medium settings I was required to use because of my system.  Audio, for the most part, was excellent.  AI was a slight step up from other games in the genre, but not as much as I had expected.  The game-play was engaging - at least for most of the game.The only negative aspect in the graphics and sound department was the tremendous amount of computer power that must be needed to run higher settings.  Although I have a mid to high computer system, I was required to run the game at a low resolution with advanced settings set to either low or medium.  I couldn't come anywhere close to my monitor's native resolution of 1920 x 1200, even with all settings on the lowest setting.What was odd is that if I let the game detect and set \"\"optimal\"\" settings, it would select a a medium resolution and high advanced settings.  But playing at that, I could only get maybe 12-15 fps.  So, the detection system was useless.  I had to tweak manually to get the framerate to acceptable levels.I finally was able to get the framerate at an average of 35-40 fps - which is very acceptable, however, every few minutes, I would hit a \"\"bump\"\" and my framerate would briefly drop to 0 and then bounce back up to the 35-40.  Because this was happening so often, I had to take another step back in the graphics department and play on DX9 mode instead of DX10.It was disappointing to have upgraded my computer to a duel core, 2gb or RAM and a 640mb Nvidia 8800 GTS DX10 graphics card only to run a game on DX9 with low settings and a low resolution.  And this was after reading tweak guides, turning off background programs, downloading the latest drivers from Nvidia, etc.  Very odd, and I suspect Crysis was rushed out and not optimized correctly.The story and the characterization were weak in my opinion - characterization more so than the story.  This is a fairly straightforward FPS with not a lot happening with character development.Levels early in the game were much more interesting with more openness and options.  As the game progressed, it became more and more linear - to the point of being very limiting.There were a lot of glitches in the game - items floating around, things spinning.  There was a lot of clipping.  Some problems became quite a nuisance.  For example, getting an objective to clear an area and after doing so just standing there for additional directions.  None came and I spent the next ten minutes searching around until I found a hostile in a boxcar just spinning around.  He wouldn't die by gunshot, so I had to grab him and throw him to the side.  Once he died, it triggered the next script and I got an updated objective.The last few levels were excruciatingly glitchy.  On the ship, I kept falling through the floor to the point that it was extremely hard to complete the objectives.  The boss battles were lame.  It appeared to me that the game was rushed toward the end and they just threw some things together.  The ending was a let down.  And the thing is, the game itself was very short - maybe 9 hours or so, I would guess.  You'd think they could develop something a little better in a few year's time.I enjoyed the game, but it just wasn't as good as I had expected.  High expectation can do that.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Crysis a solid 8.  If it were optimized to run better and without the glitches (which could be possible with some patches in the future) I would up that score to 8.5.\"", "\"This game is the long awaited follow up to 'Farcry' (one of the best FPSs of 2004). We now finally get a look at this newest offering.Here are some of the things that I've liked in the single player mode...1.)This is a FPS in which your nano armor gives you special 'skills\"\"; these  'skills' include enhanced speed, strength, armor and invisibility; and you'll need them all to survive.2.)Graphics that are smooth and flowing...plus excellent audio; both add a spooky, creepy ambiance to this jungle based horror game.3.)The ability to use and control vehicles (on land, at sea and in the air), as well as the mounted weapons on these units.4.)Generally good (but not great) enemy AI! Although some will just stand out in the open, there are some that will sneak up on you or hide behind cover; also they must reload empty weapons. Due to their larger numbers and the fact they're usually spread out, will necessitate your using your special 'skills' and the surrounding environment to defeat them. This is the basic, reoccurring challenge for this game.5.)Easy, anytime save/loads with F5/F9 respectively, as well as game generated checkpoint saves.6.)If your taking a beating (or find it too easy), you can change the degree of game difficulty anytime, as you play; you don't have to start a new game. This is a nice feature!Cons:1.)I've had a couple freeze ups, requiring reboot; also some minor video fragmentation (after extended periods of play).2.)I found the controls on flying the VTOL (vertical take-off & landing) craft were difficult to operate (the plane just didn't seem to respond to  commands quickly) with the result of frequent crashes.3.)There was one extended section where you were floating (in either space or water), that I found confusing, tedious and boring. I was lucky it was very linear, or I might never have gotten out of there.4.)A high end system is preferable. Although playable on XP, Vista can use Dx10, and combined with good hardware and a high end video card, it does  make a difference in being able to run a lot of the 'extra' graphic details.Conclusion:All the pre-release hype made it sound as if this game would easily qualify for Game of the Year honors; I don't think so. Graphically it is beautiful and it is a good game, but it's not a great game! If you liked 'Farcry' then you'll probably like 'Crysis'. Was it worth the wait...probably, but somehow I was expecting something more. Over all, I liked 'Farcry' and its gameplay a little more. However, still worth a 4 1/2-5 Star rating.\"", "I was extremely surprised at this games low quality.  I guess it somehow became famous due to the graphics being ahead of its time a few years ago and people use it to brag about benchmarking. The guns are not very accurate at all which is extremely frustrating.  I couldn't even get past the onslaught tank mission on easy-Had to use god mode.  And i'm pretty damn good at most games.  I could have gone back 7-8 saves and done what a guy on youtube does but I wish the game was just more fluid.  I guess i should have known to conserve ammo 10 mins earlier in the mission ::eyerolls::. All of the difficulty settings are pretty much the same.  Graphics are overrated and dont run well on my GTX 460 and dual core 2.9.  And finally, the story line is pretty lame.  Almost no cut scenes, no character development, none of that stuff.  You just randomly shoot asians which normally I think is funny but this time I do not.Get Just Cause 2 instead.", "This is the best Crysis game IMO (I disliked the two newer urban-based ones). I liked the island-based storyline and the overall gameplay mechanics. The graphics are mostly beautiful, except for the lighting which gets a little funky inside of buildings. For a 7 year old game though, it is still quite impressive.The flaws are few but fairly significant:1. This game will not run as-delivered on a 64-bit OS. You need to get a work-around patch through third-party sites in order to run it.2. Game is fairly buggy. Unexpected crashes happen every couple of missions, and there is one questline which is bugged.3. Didn't like the alien/scifi twist that occured at around the 2/3 mark.Other than that, it's a decent game IMO, and worth picking up for under $20.", "If you played Far Cry, then you know what this game is about and what you were expecting. The graphics are fantastic but the game play is on a lower level when compared to Far Cry.PROS -Basically, you are getting more Far Cry! LONG OVER DUE!!!Excellent graphics.New weapons.Nano Suit - give you super human abilities.CONS -Linear game play with too many scripted events.(In other words, you cannot venture around and find alternate attack routes as much as you did in Far Cry and as soon as the game hits a save point, you know action is about to happen. It takes away all the surprise!)BUGGY. This game crashes a lot. You can review different gaming forums and read the horror stories. Pretty pathetic for the excellent team of people behind CRYSIS to have released this clunker piece of manure out before it was well tested! I cannot play for more than 20 minutes without  crashing out. (Yes I am updated and even running the latest NVIDIA beta drivers designed to resolve CRYSIS problems!)This is kind of just like Far Cry all over again.Another scientific experiment gone wrong.Another batch of aliens invades the earth.The worst part is, you spend the entire 2nd half of the game fighting aliens. UGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!Also, the AI was crappy. I found the enemy to be VERY stupid and not very aggressive. In Far Cry the soldiers would come after me, flank me, attack hard. I almost could fall asleep at times waiting for the soldiers to do something!!!!This could have been the game we were waiting for. Instead, it is a clumsy, half finished, unpolished remake of a great game!", "\"CRYSIS is an exceptional game in many respects. Firstly, and most famously, it looks absolutely stunning. On maximum settings the island on which the adventure takes place truly comes to life. The quality of the graphics and the physics remain unsurpassed, in my opinion, even when compared to more recent games. Immersion is critical in games such as this and the CryENGINE used provides this in spades. There's also a pretty good storyline behind the action and the pacing is good, with the action steadily ramping up to an impressive big finale. The voice acting is always convincing and the cut-scenes fit seamlessly into the flow of the game. The combat is challenging and rewarding. I have just two criticisms: First is the fact that the single player game ends! I wanted much more but this is a game that can be played more than once as the \"\"sandbox\"\" nature of the island allows for different approaches to the gameplay, plus there's a good multiplayer version to continue the fun, and there are custom maps and mods out there. Second, there's not enough humour. I think any game benefits from a few laughs (the Half-Life series is an excellent example) but I can't remember any in CRYSIS. Still, this doesn't matter too much when what you're given is so absorbing and entertaining.\"", "First to the obvious: this game is beautiful. The graphics were groundbreaking when it was new in 2007 and are still maybe the most beautifully detailed I've ever seen (I didn't even try to run it until I built a gaming rig in 2011). If you have the computing power, they're really just gorgeous.The beginning, where you infiltrate an island overrun by PRNK troops to rescue scientists, is a lot of fun. The gunplay is good and the suit powers are cool if awkward to activate (I wish you could do it with your voice). The gorgeous scenery is a pleasure, especially in winter when it'd be nice to see some sun and green IRL.Not to give spoilers, but once you reach a certain point the game turns dramatically more science fiction, and from there it kind of lost me. The new enemies aren't as much fun for me, the vehicle episodes are frustrating, and suddenly my system starts crashing frequently. (I don't think it's a specs problem because I have pretty high end hardware that had no trouble rendering the lush jungles at max settings but I experience crashes at high and medium late in the game, including on menu screens). I uninstalled and reinstalled which didn't fix this problem.", "I usually don't bother to write reviews, but this game was too disappointing to let go.I'll keep this short: graphics are very good. I loved Far Cry, and the first half of Crysis was indeed Far Cry with more eye candy.Pros: Great Graphics - texture features, explosions, etc.  Also: no Steam-esqe account joining or on-line activation! Just load and play. Keep it that way: game developers!Cons: Many -- bugs here and there, including the big one that stopped the game for good -- shooting the 'big boss' on the carrier -- gun would not 'target'.  'Had to quit...I'm assuming that was the end :-(WORSE: story line was DULL!  Shooting thingies that looked like those in Matrix over and over again got downright boring.  Far Cry was immersive and compelling -- with so many interesting and even 'scary' chapters... and gameplay that lasted seemingly days.  Crysis does not deliver in those ways.  AI was bland and fairly unintelligent.Again, this is a short review.  Perhaps I'm getting too old for PC games -- but compared with Half Life, Unreal 2, and even the earlier Dooms 1 & 2 all of which I found 'compelling' and creative, Crysis falls short... almost flat.  -s", "\"There was a lot that went into the making of this game.  Unfortunately it was all looks and no content.  I feel like i'm playing FARCRY on STEROIDS only without the interesting story, levels AI etc. that FARCRY had.  I too was VERY MUCH looking forward to this game.  Sadly to say, I was SORELY DISAPPOINTED when I finally got to play it. It only left me appreciating S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or BIOSHOCK even more. Sure the game looks good and has some great phyiscs effects on the higher levels (which my system didn't qualify for, but I cranked up all the settings just to see what it could do.) But if you look past all the \"\"bells and whistles\"\" there isn't much there in the way of gameplay. replayablity.I too was somewhat disappointed with the ending.  I didn't mind the brevity of the game as I was just looking to be put out of my misery.  Normally i don't even write reviews, but this game disappointed me soooo that I just had to.  In closing, Crysis is like a HOT BLOND, all looks, NO substance.\"", "This game from the get go was off the chain! I recently custom built a PC, and this game sure put it's graphical capabilities to the test! The game ran really smooth, and never once had an issue with it. The game is compatible with Windows Vista-64bit in case any of you were curious. The visual effects were stunningly beautiful, every detail was almost beyond realism. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS. The storyline was fairly decent, just a little different from your typical alien shooter (1/2 of the game you deal with the Koreans, the other 1/2 of the game you deal with the alien encounter). Definitely leaves the ending open to a sequel, and we shall see it if the sales of this one are good. The game controls are fairly easy to use and can be learned to navigate through within the first 30min (The tutorial HUD as you progress in the beginning is easy to keep up with). I put probably a little over 25+hrs on normal mode, after considering all the deaths.
