The money, we learn, is going to be used to pay for Stranger's mysterious surgery.Like the other oddworld games, this one follows the fight of the innocent indigenous people of oddworld against greedy corporate . . .things.  Unlike the other oddworld games, this one doesn't involve Abe at all.The gameplay is very smooth.  You can switch from a first-person shooter mode, to a third-person mode.  The much-touted \"\"live\"\" ammo, feature, allows you to fire critters from a cross bow, which, in turn, maul, sting, or electricute bad guys.This game has more bosses than I've seen in a while.  Each one is unique, and you can try to either capture them alive, or bring them in dead.So, why only three stars? For one thing, the camera in 3rd person mode can be a pain at times - not moving where you want it to go.  I was also disappointed at the lack of cinematic sequences, this one only had five or six, while it seems like the other oddworld games tend to have more. To be fair, the sequences were very well done, there just weren't enough of them. Another problem was the playability - after just a few hours, I had beaten the game, and I have to say I have no desire to pick it back up.  But my major beef with this game is leaving out Abe.  Why would you make another oddworld game, and then not have its hero in it?Overall, this game was very original and very graphically pleasing.  It was worth renting, but I doubt I'll ever want to play it again.\"", "Stranger's Wrath may take place in Oddworld, but it also starts out with an Old West theme. You play as Stranger, a bounty hunter of unknown origins. You seem to be the only one of your kind around, and you'll spend most of the game taking on outlaws who are terrorizing various towns full of chicken-men. Why? To pay for your operation, of course. Near the start of the game, you'll discuss a mysterious operation with the local doctor. It seems that you need 20,000 bucks to pay for a procedure, and you'll earn the money the only way you know how: bringing in the bad guys. Along the way, you'll discover more about Stranger's origins and the nature of this secret operation. The game's plot, conveyed through the occasional cutscene, is definitely one of its strong points. It starts slow, but the gradual buildup pays off at the end of the game's roughly 15-hour adventure, which makes up for a lack of extras or alternate modes of play.", "Great game. One of the best games Ever!Control - AStory - ACharacter - AMusic - BSound - AGraphics - A", "\"I read an article on wired.com/news about this game and couldn't wait to get a copy. Got the Prima guide with it, which has been worth the money so far (third day).I bought a Gamecube and later a PS2 and only recently bought an Xbox (I don't like MS) and I hate to say that the graphics, at least in this game, are out-freaking-standing. Approaching photo-realistic. The scenery in O:SW is PHENOMENAL, great late-afternoon sunset lighting with beautiful little touches like bits of fluff from weeds providing counterpoint to the action and firepower. The graphics really pop.The \"\"live ammunition\"\" takes some getting used to in much the same way that it took me a while to figure out how to play the PC version of Lemmings oh-so-many-years-ago. It's GREAT fun, very imaginative, and the mazes are terrific so far. The villians are as rotten as they ought to be and the Stranger is a brilliant idea. I'm really looking forward to getting through my day and firing up the Xbox to play some more, and I just don't play that many games (I'm an OLD fart). Or maybe I'm just picky -- it's not every day, or every YEAR, that I find a game that I like, and I **LIKE** this game!The game feels really tight overall, they did a great job producing it. Good concept, great art direction, the gameplay is a lot of fun -- I love this game! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! THIS ONE'S WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!\"", "\"Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is a brilliant bounty-hunter game from the off-beat creators of the Oddworld series. You roam through a fantastic world chasing down enemies with your arsenal of living creatures.The game is extremely well animated and rendered, with a variety of creatures that you immediately connect with. There are little multi-teethed killer Fuzzles, the oh-so-cute Chippunks, flying creatures, smelly creatures, and more. You fire all of these with your crossbow, wreaking mayhem on your enemies.The theory here is that you're trying to capture as many bad guys as you can alive, to get the largest bounty for them. Different enemies call for different capture techniques. Some require the flying monsters, while others need to be wound up in a cocoon. It's all done with an \"\"old west\"\" motif, with drawling, laconic discussion and dusty, tumbleweed landscapes.We love the game. The dialogue is brilliant at times, the gameplay is engaging. Your ammo is just so much fun! They talk back to you, laugh as they are flung at the enemies and have a variety of attack styles. When you run out, you just go to a patch of weeds and track down some more.The game goes between first person and third person and does so rather well. My only real complaint is with the camera, which at times gets caught behind buildings and other obstacles.The game guides you along nicely. You are pursuing bounty person X, you know their hideout area, you go there and find them. It keeps you moving along in the right direction.If there's a real complaint, it is that the game does NOT work on the XBox 360. This is one of the only reasons we were holding onto our ancient XBox system and I would much rather be playing this on the XBox 360. It looks very unlikely that they're ever going to patch the 360 to support this older game, though.Still, if you own an XBox, I definitely recommend finding this game!\"", "Open world oddwrold game with a western touch to sum it all up. The humor is still there and the story is definetly an interesting one more better then the past itterations. The gameplay is a nice blend of platforming and first person shooting when in combat it works well, the game is filled with boss fights that require you to use your weapon and enviroment wisely. Its somewhat of a lengthy game but has little replay value but if you like the game first time around you'll come back to it for sure.", "\"**UPDATE** Sad news from Lorne Lanning and Oddworld Inhabitants, the creators of this spectacular series.  Oddworld Inhabitants is closing its doors.  After creating 4 games in what was supposed to be a huge series and with 2 games already in development for next gen systems, they are closing up.  Chances are this will be the last game featuring the loveable creatures of Oddworld.  But fear not, Lanning believes he might be able to crack into the TV or movie business in order to have his property protected.  Keep an eye on them.  They are so talented, their studio might be the next Pixar.On to the review:I'm very disappointed in the mistreatment this game has been getting from the professional online reviewers like IGN, Gamespot and Gamespy.  When I was trying to figure out if this game was worth purchasing or not, I had to literally search the entire page at the Xbox branch of IGN just to find the review.  Normally, reviews get top billing; not the case with this beautifully unique game.A lot has been said about the \"\"gimmick\"\" of having live ammo.  Given the series of Oddworld (Abe's Oddysee and Exodus, Munch's Oddysee), how someone could label the live ammo as a gimmick is beyond me.  Oddworld is a world very different from our own.  Stranger's Wrath just heightened this oddity by giving you creatures to fire instead of finding ammo for your tripple-barrelled, shoots rockets and has a flame-thrower attached, shotgun.  And it fits in the universe perfectly.  Now, if this was a Halo game (for example), yes having live ammo would be a gimmick.  But, it fits in perfectly with the Oddworld mythos and provides a truly engaging experience.Another thing that I feared after reading the sorely mistaken (IMO) professional reviews was that it was virtually impossible to capture the bosses alive.  Being a bounty hunter, it is your mission to capture wanted villains either dead or alive.  By capturing them alive you get two or more times the money than capturing them dead.Now, if you were to read a lot of reviews from IGN etc, it would seem that you couldn't capture any of the bosses alive.  While I have been playing games all of my life and am better than the average gamer in some respects, I would definitely not consider myself a master of the FPS genre.  By any stretch.  And yet I was able to capture every single boss alive.  Now, there were a couple that made me very frustrated and it took me more than a handful of tries to do it, I was able to.  The game definitely makes you work to get that full bounty but it's not impossible.As far as the story goes, the developers once again created a uniquely different story involving Stranger and his past.  I will not reveal any story spoilers, but not is all what it seems and there will come a point where the way you look at the game changes in an exciting way.  And from that point on, the game ramps up the excitement to a wonderful climax.Graphically, the game is beautiful.  It makes me remember why I bought the Xbox.  Not only are the lush environments beautifully rendered, but the framerate moves swiftly.  Seeing Strange bound at a cheetah speed through these beautiful environments is striking.  There is some pop-up, especially in Mango (sp?) Valley where bushes will pop up in the distance.  But considering the speed and the graphics the game is pushing, it doesn't really bother me.As far as controls go, this game is well designed.  Switching between first person and third person is as easy as tapping the R3 button.  This change works really well, giving you the best of both worlds, the percision of first person shooting, and the fluidity and speed of moving in third person.  I have a couple complaints though.  Moving up and down rope is a pain.  The animation is kinda clunky and I don't see why you can't slide down rope, instead of hand over hand moving down it.  Hey, if the Prince can slide down rope, why can't Stranger?  But this is a minor quibble.As far as the sound goes, again Oddworld Inhabitants (the developers) did an excellent job.  Stranger's voice is a little silly to me, he talks in a slow drawl that seems to be a cross between Clint Eastwood and Forrest Gump.  But the other voices are remarkable, especially considering that most (if not all) are done in house with the Lead voicing most characters in all of the Oddworld games.My only real complaint is that the game isn't long enough.  It's longer than Halo 2 (which is a bonus), and I don't know exactly how many hours I clocked in on it, but it felt like it was over too fast.  I guess what disappointed me was that I was having so much fun exploring Oddworld again that no matter how long or short it was I would be sad to leave it.  The world is just so interesting.The level design is also very linear.  In today's world of GTA openness, people might have a problem with that, which is why I bring it up.  The levels have a set path.  That's not to say the gameplay is linear.  There are MANY different ways to tackle every situation.  The joy of having live ammo is that you are presented with a myriad of ways to take down the opposition, creating gameplay that allows you to experiment.  But if you're looking for a Deus Ex type of environment where there are multiple paths to get to the boss, you won't find it here.What the game does best is refresh video games.  From the opening CG cinema (which is Pixar quality) to all of the loveably strange and bizarre characters, this game oozes originality and charm.  You can tell the developers truly care about the artform of video games.  They love what they do and the game was a refreshing experience.To sum it up, I can't say enough about this game.  It is unique.  It is beautiful.  And it is fun.  Even after the 5th time trying to take down a boss alive, I didn't throw down the controller in anger.  It kept me wanting to play until I could take him down.  If you are tired of the same old save Earth from \"\"insert name of alien race here\"\", or similar I would definitely recommend this game.  It is hard, but it is easily one of the most enjoyable games I have played in ages.  And the jolt of energy the games gives you about half way through the game is enough for me to recommend buying this game.\"", "The title I put is a bold claim; especially with the recent release of Halo 2. But honestly, this latest incarnation of Oddworld offers the most fun I've had on the XBox with a third/first person shooter. At first the game fools you - The live ammo seems a little gimmicky and trudging from one bounty boss to another seems initially tiring. But this game has a storyline like no other. Just when you think you've completed the game EVERYTHING changes - in a good way. It's like two games in one and both parts are incredible. If you don't want to know anymore then stop reading now and go play the game! I didn't know about the 'surprise' path the game takes and was blown away. One minute you're in the Wild West, the next you're in a Halo-esque futuristic world full of cranes, spaceships, cannons, rockets and all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures. Gone are the linear quests to rope in badguys - replaced by a fairly free roaming world of adventure. Truly huge effort has been placed into both elements of gameplay and the graphics, sound, dialogue and even the strange ammo system is perfect. I simply loved this game - a jewel in the XBox crown."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0809951201081276, 0.2522085905075073, 0.1789257973432541, 0.16407546401023865, 0.03078632801771164, 0.003147404408082366, 0.27561435103416443, 0.014247001148760319]]}
