It was the game battlefield 1942 that gave the series its popularity.Graphics. Yeah, good for its time, but unless your graphics card AND you processor are more than three years old, you won't have any problem running it at max detail. The water effects are gorgeous and should be mentioned.Sound. This game has some of the best and most believable sound effects i have ever heard in a game. You will start sweating when you hear that enemy chopper comming...for YOU! The music is also great, unfortuneately, it is not used in game, and there are only four tracks.Gameplay. Superextraordinaryfantasticallygreat, this new word that I just made up is used to describe that gameplay. Basically, there are 7 roles you can play in a battleAssault - Good in fire-fights, tires quicklySniper - Sneaky, stealthy, fast, and camoflaugedSpecial Ops - Accurate weapons and good speed, but no armorSupport - You carry a big gun! ~oh yeah!Engineer - A guy with a shotgun and a wrench (help me!)Medic - You're like assault, except your not as good!Anti-Tank - Its more like anti - everything!Needless to say, the 11 maps turn into full-fledged wars, and man - it's really fun! The game really shines when you and your team work together with strategy, working alone dulls the excitement (Unless you're an assassin type class). The game has its flaws in gameplay, though, all the vehicles are really unbalanced, how the hell does one take out a tank with a sniper rifle? When I am seen by a tank, it ussually amounts to me running on top of the tank (because it's safe there), and praying that no enemies happen to stroll by the tank and notice me. (This makes the drives REALLY angry).Multiplay. One thing, if you are not going to go online with this game, forget buying it, go back to playing boring linear singleplayer shooters laden with repitition that makes you bored even thinking about it. Or, go and play an RPG (I recommend Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion).Value. The day I am writing this, the price tag is $7.99, unless you are ultra cheap, you probably realize that this is a superb game at an unbelievablely low price.Replay. Ok, I play it EVERY weekend for three hours, is that enough replay value for you?Ok, BF2 is not for everyone, if your the kind of guy who thinks shooters are cheap junk with no replay value, well, unless you want to be dragged kicking and screaming into the world of reallity, you probably won't want to buy this game. Or if you like futuristic shooters, you may want to check out Battlefield 2142, even though it's twice as expensive.For eveyone else - Simply click on \"\"buy\"\"Graphics - 9/10Sound - 10/10Gameplay - 9/10Multiplay - 10/10Value - 10/10Replay - 10/10Overall - 10/10 - Superextraordinaryfantasticallygreat++!\"", "Wow. This game is really something. It isnt really much of a comparison to 1942 since the gameplay action is so much smoother and better. Its not the type of game that you would get sick of either, you can play endlessly online. I really want this!", "\"I used to furrow my brow at the site of each new model of S-Class Mercedes, usually redone every 5 years or so.  I can remember my father telling me that Mercedes designs cars to look good tomorrow, not today.  He was right.  With every model, like clockwork, after a year or so they'd start looking good, then great.  My bet is Battlefield will be much like that.  As truly fun as it is to play today, it'll be much better in a year or so.Few quick reasons to love this game:1.  When you run it on a great machine the graphics/game physics are mindblowing.2.  The game encourages teamplay.  I know, it's hard to imagine quake trained gamers playing medics, but over the past months since its release, the game is conditioning its players to team up.  It's working, and it's really really fun to work with a good squad.3.  The game/network is very intelligent.  Scarily intelligent.  Everything you do on a ranked server is tracked forever.  Everything.  Gaining rank gets you new weapons and status you can leverage into a Commander position.4.  This game not only supports VOIP, but encourages it.  Commanders can talk to squad leaders, squad leaders talk to their members, very good order.5.  Online play will frequently (i'm talking multiple times an hour) give you \"\"one of those gaming moments\"\".  You know, when your pulse quickens, and you feel like you're really in the game.  My girlfriend can hear me screaming from my downstairs (things that would make a pornstar blush).  I'm not even cognizant of it.6.  Helicopters with TV guided rockets. Nuf said.7.  Command and control.  If a side plays without a commander, odds are they'll lose.  If one plays with few (if any) experienced squad leaders, they'll lose.  Very cool and unique feature.Reasons you might not want this game:1.  This is the most insane system-hog of a game I've ever encountered...very frustrating for even relatively good systems.I've had high hopes for games of all genres over the past 2-3 years, I've reviewed many of them, some favorably, but I think BF2 is the best action First Person Shooter on the market (and probably will be for a few years).  One reason for that belief is the extraordinary hardware requirements it demands to truly perform.  I started playing it on a 3.3MHZ w/ best Geforce card, and 1Meg of RAM.  It lumbered, and the graphics were subpar compared to other FPS's.  I now have a freakin super-computer (dual cards, 4Megs RAM) and it runs like a different game.  When hardware catches up, the underlying value of this game will get more appreciation vs. present-day frustration.I've logged at least 70 hours on this game, and I learn something new every night.  So many layers to uncover, then combine.  I think this game still has allot to show people.  And, like each redesigned model of Mercedes, will prove its true beauty over time.Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California\"", "\"Well, this review is from playing the Demo multiplayer level, not the full game.  But, even in this short of a span I already know this isn't a game I'm going to put my money down on.  I played BF 1942 and loved it.  This game looks very vehicle dependent.  Being on foot is pretty worthless.  Even if you are an anti-tank player, it really does no good as the anti-tank missles don't home in and are almost impossible to get a kill on a vehicle at almost any distance.  There are aircraft all ove the place, as well as anti-aircraft missle turrets you can jump into.  The only problem is they are \"\"suppose\"\" be be heat seaking missles, but almost NEVER hit their target.  The aircraft can drop flares to throw off the homing ability, but even when they never drop flares, I was only ONCE able to get a kill.  So, for the most part, aircraft can fly around unapposed.You'll find yourself getting killed from no where a lot.  I'll be running along and all of a sudden I'm dead.  I don't know where it came from, or what it was.  It gives you an indicator to show what direction it is coming from, but you almost never see what is shooting at you.If you love spawn killing, then this game is for you.  I would spawn into a base and have a tank 15 feet from me pointed right at me.  You don't even have a chance to move before you are dead.  And for those of you that played BF 1942 and remember how bad spawn killing could be, it's 10 times worse now.The sniper is hard to use.  I would shoot and shoot and shoot sometimes at a motionless target, yet they wouldn't die.  Maybe this game doesn't let you shoot as far as you can see, I don't know.  Part of the problem is the scope itself.  With one of the sniper rifles, the crosshairs block what you are trying to aim at.  You can't really try to go for a head shot, because you can't tell if you are on the head because the crosshairs are always in the way.  With the other sniper I used, it used a crosshair system I wasn't use to, and I could never tell if I was even getting close.To me this game was exactly like the BF 1942 mod Modern Combat.  The vehicles are the same, weapons are pretty much the same, and even has some of the same problems that Modern Combat had, like the difficulty using sniper scopes and the dependency on vehicles.  If you like the Modern Combat mod, then this game may be for you.  But, I never could get into it, and I can't get into this game either.\"", "\"battlefield 2 is a POTENTIALLY great game.  it has a lot of things going for it.  the combat, the combat kits, the helicopters, jets and tanks... very cool stuff.  the problem is in its full execution, this game sucks.  the maps are BIG.  this means you spend all your time just DRIVING in a tank.  you can't WALK anywhere because the map is too big.  this problem is so fundamental that the makers of battlefield 2 must be idiots (they screwed up bf1942 and vietnam too, so i guess so).  nonetheless, they got more right in BF2 than in the previous games, no question there, particularly in THE CONTROLS.  the controls are great here.  the problem is they need to team up with the call of duty creators for this game to be worth playing.call of duty 1 and united offensive got one thing overwhelmingly right - close combat.  in fact, the creators themselves realized how \"\"right\"\" they got combat and how much they screwed up the \"\"big map, bunch of tanks\"\" idea, and swung too far to the other side with call of duty 2, which has tiny maps and no vehicles at all.  the answer to the ultimate game problem is obvious - we need a game with awesome close combat AND maps just big enough and with just enough tanks and jets.  BF2 is far too geared to tanks and planes.  there needs to be more emphasis on foot soldiers.  too much time getting around, too much empty space, not enough action = not fun.the other thing they screwed up is the PC voice commands.  while saying things like \"\"enemy chopper spotted,\"\" or \"\"need ammo here!\"\" well the commands SOUND awesome.  the problem is, you can't tell WHO is saying them!  you're supposed to look at the mini-map and see which dot is blinking yellow, apparently.. they need to make it easier.  call of duty does a better job at that.a tip for you:  if you're using zone alarm and having connection problems with this game, turn zone alarm off and turn windows firewall on.  this solved all my connection problems like many other people are having.\"", "I was sick and tired of seeing WWII shooters coming one after another mainly because the weapon selection usually sucks in this games due to the technology available at the time. I want to see M16s, M4s, M249s, P90s, F2000s, HK G36s, UMP-45s, and MP7s along with modern military vehicles and tactics. Battlefield 2 appeared to be the answer. The graphics are top-notch and fly on my P4 + Radeon X1950 GT rig. The weapon selection is amazing, and the vehicles are definitely a bonus. Call of Duty 4 is coming out and promises to be a big step up from BF2 in terms of gameplay, but BF2 pretty much pioneered the use of vehicles and allowed seamless transitions from driver to gunner to a ground pounder; a 400 page Microprose manual was not required to operate the M1 Abrams or the M998.", "I have been playing the BF series for about a year now and I am not going to say anything new that the other reviewers haven't said about this game. If you like combat and single/multiplayer battles then you should like this game. As far as I know there is no other game out there right now that has the commander mode to the effect of accually commanding AI in a single player game to attack at specified locations on the map or scan the map for the ememy's location and call in artillery to hinder the ememy's advance. No other game right now has the squad based warfare in both sing/multi gameplay modes like Battlefield 2 has. This is an intovation in the new era of not only war gaming but multiplayer gaming period!Now I am not a big multiplayer fan simply because I find in multiplayer games there is hacking and cheating no matter if punk buster is enabled or not because there is always someone smart enough to speed hack into someones server just to many computer literate people out there not to break the rules so I tend to go solo a lot in single player. We'll here's the deal and I don't care what anyone say's. The single player server in this game can be just as challenging if not more dificult then playing online. Why? The AI is scripted depending on your level of dificulty to advance and defend they're territory as much as possible and if need be make the nesasary sacrifices to overcome their ememy. It's true that the map and amount of bots are to the mim. in single player but if you just look out there you can find mods that integrate 32 and even 64 sized maps into single player with the number of bot increased as we'll. This may sound great but I've been having problems with my game crashing on me when playing one of these mods so I tried setting my game spec's down a little. Same thing. Just keep in mind that even though you can get the bot and map sized increased in these mods, most likely your system won't be able to haddle it.Now for the system spec's..............this is where the game fails why? Because they could of used a different engine and required less memory or push on your system's processor and graphics card and still would of had decent graphics and better overall gameplay but EA took the route that most game developers do not dare. Why? They figure that even if you can't play it now you will eventually upgrade your computer in the future like most of us do and will eventually be able to play it in the years to come as technology advances at an alarming rate. Why does this matter you say? Because then they have created a much broader selling time frame than most game's that come out have. Due to it just being a Battlefield series type game and the popularity of these type's of games it is sure to sell years down the road. Look at Battlefield 42. it's still selling even though most of us have moved on to the BF Vietnam series pervious to this release and the Desert Combat and other mods for BF42. Now that's good marketing but bad for the customer because he will have to pay money and lots of it to play this game. I did! Just like most people here went out and bought the best I could afford graphics card (GF 6660 GT) and was literally let down by the games overall preformance. I wish I would have just kept my 5200 GF Nvidia because despite what they say on the box it does work on older graphics cards but you just can't set it much above the lowest settings. Who cares as long as it runs smooth right? So I am disapointed a little with the games preformace especially with a brand new GF 6600 card? Gee, maybe I should have bought the 6800? This is stupid. HL 2 and Doom 3 have 10 x better compatabilty than this game which I think they have lost a percentage of clientel at least temporarly due to the games requirements on your system until the general PC population catches up in a year or two. This is bad business to me but hey, they are just wanting to make a profit just like everyone else and not at your conveniance. So you can see I feel alittle jaded somewhat with the system requirements only because since I have been gaming I have never had any problem with any game's preformance until now even with an updated graphics card? This makes me think that the problem is within the game's coding and not my system itself so don't be fooled. Think about it. Let them come out with some patches before you get serious and buy this if you haven't already.So, if your looking for a good time on the BF like in 42 and NAM then give er' a try just be warned unless you have an AlienWare PC system, blazing processor and 2 GB's of RAM  not to mention an 7800 GF graphics card, then this review doesn't apply to you at all!", "This game I have put over 1000 Hours online.  I played this game for over 5 years and know it inside and out.  I have rcently in the last 4 months have stopped playing it and went to Call of Duty MW.  Occasionally I go back and play a round or 2 of Battlefield 2 (BF2) Online. I am disliking it more and more everytime I play it.The game itself is awesome.  But there are so many hackers out there...and there are a lot in this game.  In the last 25 maps I've played online there were at least 5 hackers with aimbots, wall hacks, or some other BS that makes actually playing the game worthless.  Punkbuster and Server admin used to keep a firm lockdown on all aimbotters and hackers but not anymore.  The people who use cheats and hack made this game suck.  So if I were you thinking about buying this game to play it online I suggest to just wait till BF3 comes out so Punkbuster will actually pay attention.The game was awesome when it first came out up to about 5 years later and then all the hacking came in and nobody cared...rating it a 5 star because in its prime it was amazing!!!", "Want to play the best single player war game? Then go play Call of Duty 2. Want to play the best SWAT type tactical? Then go get Half-Life 2 and play Counter-Strike: Source which goes through periodic updates. Want to play the best multiplayer war game? Then before you even consider playing Day of Defeat: Source, go directly for Battlefield 2 instead which is certainly what you have been looking for and probably more. As a sequel to Battlefield 1942 (one of the best multiplayer games ever devised) it is well worthy of its predecessor's name but abandons its World War II premise for modern twenty-first century urban and rural warfare. As the game is built for multiplayer the single player campaigns do not do it justice. You really need to have a broadband connection and join a server to see the game the way it was meant to be played. Player statistics are monitored on-line and allow you to improve in rank and receive new weapons (unlocks). This makes it highly competitive. The same player classes are retained from BF1942 with some additional ones - sniper, machine gunner, anti-tank, medic, engineer, assault and support. The big bonus is the amount of new vehicles that the game has to offer, such as several types of planes, helicopters, tanks and cars. BF2 is one big CTF (capture the flags) with a huge array of photorealistic maps to play in. At player spawn you are given a wide choice of weapons and classes to choose from. Then you have the option of either working as a unit, driving a vehicle (that can also act as carriers) or just leaving your team behind and going on a solo mission frag-a-thon across a vast map (and these are some of the biggest maps ever made). Where BF1942 gave us the historical Pearl Harbor, Petersburg, German Forests, French Country, Operation Overlord, multiplayer style, BF2 goes for made-up non-historical global wars that have a futuristic atmosphere about them. Essentially you will play wars that have yet to be fought with the exception of several Iraq and Middle East type maps. It feels prophetic. The graphics are certainly heaps and bounds ahead of BF1942 giving us better textures, right down to photorealistic grass that you crawl through and branches on bushes that you can snipe behind. You can dash at very fast speeds until your stamina runs out. Explosions rock the world around you, can stun you and send pieces flying through the air. When a black hawk is downed in the town square it destroys everything around it on impact. Medics can revive dying team-mates. This is some of the best multiplayer entertainment you have ever seen. It is the biggest war game that people play online with a very large community (so large that you will find difficulty in choosing a login name for your ID) meaning plenty of 60 player (30/30) servers up and running and for you to join. All though you might just want to start running across a map shooting all around you, as in a real war this approach will probably just get you killed. The game itself takes days to grasp with patients that you must master. You must ensure that for bug free gaming to download and install the latest BF2 patch (currently 1.12 at this time of writing) which prevents crashing to desktop and has extra maps. Never use a CD-DVD crack with BF2 as they don't work. Instead either use the CD-DVD or learn how to load a BF2 mini-image. To be honest the quality of technical support is not the best (but does not make the game experience less) and could be a little clearer. The community is less responsive to answering questions and without something like IRC (internet relay chat) it can be difficult to find a channel of users who are willing to help you learn more about how to play the game. Another gripe is that this game has the hardest controller configuration that simply does not have to be as difficult as it is to program. BF1942 had this problem also. Sadly BF2 hasn't bothered to solve it. A major con is in the load times. High end systems take about two and a half minutes to load each map. The menu screens are not instant. Before Operation Flashpoint 2 brings us the best war multiplayer simulator ever conceived we still want to be able to play a multiplayer war game that will match the experience of Call of Duty 2 on a server with up to 64 players. BF2 does just that.Pros:- Multiplayer must-have.- Fairly realistic simulation experience that you will play again and again.- The only World War II simulation worth playing on-line right now.- Good game engine. Solid Gaming.- Replaces Operation Flashpoint and BF1942 and Day of Defeat: Source as the best on-line war simulation game.- Really big player numbers of servers.- Massive Maps.Cons:- Needs updating and this is not made clear on the EA website.- Needs broadband.- Steep learning curve.- Long load up times.- System resource heavy.", "I bought two copies of this game so my son and I could play together on shared servers and we enjoyed it for about a year. The patches are required because it was highly buggy in retail form.", "I sold this a long time ago about 4 years now and just bought it back and boy am I happy I did. Maybe there are better games out at the moment but this game is still fun after 5 years of its release. I have herd that they will be making battlefield 3 which i am very excited about which made me pick this up to refresh my memory of how spectacular bf 3 will probably be."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12645778059959412, 0.2062368243932724, 0.22992758452892303, 0.03516175225377083, 0.03664156794548035, 0.00892338715493679, 0.006046229973435402, 0.0627964660525322, 0.009936566464602947, 0.11355024576187134, 0.16432157158851624]]}
