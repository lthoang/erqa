I use it every day.  It's an excellent product.", "I received the Sony Reader as a gift and I absolutely love it! It's easy to use, easy to hold and read, and the free cover that comes with it is very nice. There is no need to purchase an extra cover. I like the zoom in feature that allows you to increase the size of the print. (There are three settings:  small, medium, and large.)100 free Classics are available through 3/31, but now there are public domain books available through Sony/Google. In addition to the books available from Sony's store, but I have been able to download books in .pdf format for 2 weeks each through my public library's website. I'm sure each library has their own rules.I would highly recommend the Sony Reader for avid readers!", "\"Let's get the negatives out of the way. As has been noted in other reviews, the Sony 505 has problems with displaying pdf files properly. For me, this isn't an issue because all I need the reader for is for reading eBooks. Number two, the Sony eBook website is very slow, clunky, and stupid. The web designers for Sony's eBook site were either hired at a cut rate, or didn't give a hoot about the functionality of it. But after a while, the pain goes away and you'll actually get use to it.It doesn't have the capability to download books over wireless, but this is such a non-issue because all your downloading can be accomplished with your computer anyway. Since most of us use a computer in our daily chores, no wireless is not a problem.One more consideration or \"\"negative\"\" about eBook readers is the exorbitant price of these devices. There are sometimes promotionals from Sony that you can look into to drop the price of the Sony 505, or you can use credits or coupons from your Amazon card. Until the retail price of these readers approaches $150, the high cost may be a deterrent for many to buy this reader and other reader brands.Now for the good stuff. The Sony 505 is everything you want in an eReader. The display is crisp and clean, and you can literally load tens of dozens of eBooks into this little device. Add a SD card or Sony memory card and you'll have more than enough books to keep you busy for a year or more.The Sony 505 is a classy looking device and doesn't look cheap. It is solidly built and is very easy to navigate. You can also listen to music via the headphone port, but this will seriously bring down the battery power of your reader very quickly, so beware.My reader is full of public domain novels and articles which can be downloaded for free via the Sony eBook library software or on independent sites that offer free ePub digital books. The regular books for purchase on the Sony eBook site are relatively expensive if you consider that these are just eBooks. But there is such a wealth of material on Google public domain books and ePub, it'll be quite a while before you dip your hand into purchasing titles from the Sony library.I've had my Sony 505 for a couple of weeks now and I am very satisfied with its performance, look, and function.\"", "I own this device.  Love it.  The screen is perfect.  It's easy to read on.  It holds a ton of books and the biggest features is Sony Connects availability of titles.  I always find what I am looking for.  [...]  I would recommend this device over the $100 more expensive Kindle unless your desire is to read the newspaper on your device.  I don't read the newspaper so I don't want that one feature.  I can easily buy and download books onto my Sony and the prices of the books are very reasonable. I love the product. I am a hardcore reader and that is what this device is made for.  Someone who wants to save the wear and tear of reading on a device on their eyes.  E-ink is worth the price.Kindle6 inch screen4 level grayscale10.3 ouncesSony E-book6 inch screen8 level grayscale9 ouncesHmmm.....if what you are paying for is the e-ink technology then Sony has Kindle beat with a savings of $100.", "My wife has used the Sony Reader for a few years now and loves it. It is every bit as good as a Kindle, but costs and weighs less.  We travel a lot, so it is a great way for her to take MANY books for only 7 ounces!What a great (and green) product!", "Good product, very slim and portable. I like the fact that you can upload PDF documents, musics,and pbotos (although only in B& W).Some limitations, on works on Windows base systems and only takes Sonny music format.However, as a student it's awesome for taking your notes or lectures with you in PDF format.Sonny should broaden their horizon and open the sourcing to Mac and mutilple mp3 formats.  The kindle gives this a run for the money with the ability to get newspapers and magazines.Otherwise great size. Great price and pretty handy device.", "\"The Sony PRS-505 is a great little gem that I purchased recently. I'll list out the pros and cons below:PROS:1) Great screen quality. Text is very sharp and clear. It doesn't have the glossiness/glare associated with newer touch screen Sony readers like the PRS-600 and PRS-700. The \"\"page\"\" is a shade lighter than the page color on the Kindle 2.2) Nice metallic body which gives it a much more robust feel compared to the plastic Kindle.3) Looks great with its brushed aluminum body4) Support for EPUB format, which is a new open ebook format that has gained widespread support amongst ebook publishers (except of course from Amazon which unfortunately insists on using its own proprietary format). This is VERY important because it means that you can buy ebooks from a number of publishers. You aren't tied down to the Sony store alone (unlike the Kindle where the only option is to buy from Amazon and its inventory).5) Support for EPUB format means that you can borrow ebooks from most local libraries in the US. This can end up providing you with a huge costs saving in the long run. Unfortunately, this isn't possible with the Kindle...not until Amazon decided to enable EPUB capabilities (which would be awesome and then probably make the Kindle 2 hands down one of the best ereaders out there)6) Memory card expansion slot is great for storing tons of books on your ereader.7) You can custom flash the firmware (Search google for PRS Customizer) to do all sorts of neat tweaks. For example you can flash the reader to use custom fonts, enable a clock in your status bar, use custom logos as well as re-map a whole bunch of keys so as to make the user interface comfortable for yourself.9) Text re-flow support on PDFs isn't too bad. The best results are when you use PDFs formatted for the smaller screen (9cm x 12cm documents). Page turns are fairly snappy with most PDFs. However, regular A4 pdfs don't work too well (as is the case with all ereaders with screens this size). You can rotate to landscape orientation to improve the font size in this case. In addition, there are tools that can help you crop margins on PDFs to remove whitespace and increase the size of PDF text.10) The \"\"book\"\" case it comes with is pretty nice and I personally prefer reading books on the reader with the binder on. It feels more like reading a book, and it is also more comfortable when reading in bed.CONS:1) No wireless whispernet feature/internet access. Not a big deal for me but it certainly can be for others. It is nice to know that you could impulsively buy a book wherever you are provided you have wifi connectivity.2) Amazon has a huge collection of ebooks and most of them are a bit cheaper than other ebook stores. However this advantage is already diminishing due to Amazon's refusal to adopt the EPUB format and the fact that practically all other ebook stores have adopted the EPUB format.3) PDF support. This is a pro and a con. The con is that ebook readers could potentially have much better PDF and zoom features but they don't have them. This is common across the board...Sony, Kindle, Bookean, etc. Only the high end readers like the DX and the Iliad have better PDF support, but even their PDF support is a bit lacking considering how expensive those readers are.That is pretty much it. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is a great little device and has many more features than the new Sony PRS-300. Considering that you can get the PRS-505 under 200 dollars if you try hard enough, it is a steal!\"", "I have had the PRS-505 for over a year.Sadly, I dropped it on a tile floor and the display failed.There probably is no product that would survive this kind of fall.Unfortunately, it's out of warranty, so I have watched the market very carefully.SCREEN - Please note that, unless you have held and read eInk technology, you should not be purchasing ANY device for reading. Sony and Nook and Kindle all use the same vendor for eInk, and if you are seriously trying to replace books, no LCD screen comes close. Unless the color screen on the new iPad has capabilities that, for some reason, Apple failed to mention (!) it will not be usable for reading. The difference really is night and day. The eInk look is as good as paper. Any LCD screen is too fuzzy and flickery to be comfortable for any serious use.BATTERY - Again, eInk technology is a requirement. It uses almost zero power when the page is the same, versus LCD screens which waste a tremendous amount of power on backlighting. The Kindle, Nook and Sony readers will go 10-14 days without a charge - iPad or any other LCD will go a few hours. Not much use on a plane or car trip.FREE MEDIA - This is important! The Kindle and Nook do NOT allow you to read free material in ePub format. This is the only practical free format for ebooks. It is the FREE format used by Google books and Gutenberg.org. If you want to read classics, or move your book freely from desktop to reader to friend's readers, you cannot use the Nook or Kindle. Sony is the only major vendor to support ePub with no DRM. Be careful out there - Nook appears to support free formats, but if you try their desktop program, and the specs carefully, you'll see it is useless for free formats. Also, note that PDF results may vary. Because of the flow characteristics of text within PDF documents, many are not suitable for reading on ANY reader.Personally, I would not purchase ANY device which does not work with rights-free ePub format. That leaves you with some of the smaller vendors and Sony - none others at present.There are many other features you CAN consider, but these three completely outweigh all others.", "I have had my 505 over a yr now. It has been an excellent unit. If you are looking for a moderatly priced e-ink device, this is for you. It supports a variety of formats including PDF. Sometimes can't get the font  large enough, but landscape view takes care of the problem acceptably. I am upgrading to the 700, but only because I really need the ability to highlight and make annotations as I am a full time college student. I notice some people do not like the Sony program which supports it, but I personally do not find it a problem. So, if your looking for a nice e-ink device and don't need the other stuff, I recomend it highly.Another concern people express is the number of titles at Sony's site. They have gotten more since they began and also there are other places where you can download books they don't have. In addition, some sites offer some of the same books at a little cheaper price.Richard", "After reading everything I could find and stalling to see the Kindle 2 I finally broke down & picked this up.  The wireless feature on the Kindle is cool & the idea of getting my paper every day was attractive but not for the additional expense & the Sony's form factor is much better - smaller and more solid feeling (the Kindle felt like I was going to snap it in two any second).Reading is very comfortable & from time to time I have caught myself licking my finger in preparation for a page turn!  Downloads are easy too although the books generally are a couple of bucks more than on amazon & the selection isn't as good.  Come on Amazon let me in!Overall I love this and am very pleased with my decision.", "I've heard a lot of debate about ebooks and e-readers on the web, so I just wanted to put in my two cents. I actually own a Sony PRS-505 Reader (pictured on the left) so I thought my comments might be relevant!Prior to purchasing my Sony Reader, I was extremely ambivalent about ebooks. The few I tried to read on my computer hurt my eyes after some time, and it was no match to holding the book in my hands. There was no satisfaction of turning pages - scrolling just didn't cut it. So I gave up on ebooks and returned to my tried and true method.However, I got engaged in September and started planning a two week whirlwind tour of Italy for our honeymoon. On top of that, since I'm not getting married anywhere near where I live, I knew there were going to be a lot of traveling, a lot of plane trips. So I decided that despite my misgivings about ebooks, especially considering the restrictions on luggage weight now, I needed to invest in an ebook reader.I purchased the Sony Reader over the Amazon Kindle for a few reasons: first, aesthetics. The Sony is sleek and shiny, whereas the Kindle looks like it's straight out of the 80's with its white boxiness. Second, the Sony can read pdf files whereas the Amazon Kindle can't. Third, the Sony was in stock at my local Borders, whereas Amazon had a wait time of who knows how long for the Kindle. It is definitely true that the books available for purchase are better on Amazon, but I've been happy with the selections available for the Sony Reader as well, especially considering all the free classics I've been able to get!Now for the real meat of it: the reading experience. While turning the pages with a button does take some getting used to, it is easy enough. The screen itself is completely clear and easy to read; I've forgotten that I'm not reading an actual book multiple times! Though it was definitely expensive, I think it's one of the best investments I've made in a very long time. I've used it a ton of times (though only when traveling - when I'm at home, I still like real books. I don't think I'll ever use it except through necessity), and love it more and more each time! It's wonderful to be able to carry around hundreds of books in this small form; there aren't any weight concerns anymore, and I always have a vast selection of books to choose from. Plus the battery lasts a long time; I've taken the Reader on a three day long trip with 6 hours of travel time each way and returned with the battery half-full.What do I not like about it? Well, the Reader software can be frustrating, especially because of its lack of drag-and-drop functionality. Plus, since it's an electronic device, it has to be turned off during plane takeoffs and landings, which leaves me twiddling my thumbs for 20 minutes. Also, the only charger the Reader comes with is a USB charger, which would normally be fine except that it won't charge from anything unless it has the software installed. So if you're trying to be clever and use your USB iPod wall charger with the Reader, it won't work. To charge it from the wall, you have to purchase a separate charger, which is annoying because the cost of the Reader is already so hefty! And let's face it - when it comes down to it, there is no replacement for a tried-and-true book.The bottom line: I can't recommend the Sony Reader highly enough for those of you who travel and weigh down your luggage with books. I love it, and I'm sure you will too!"], "Gamma": [0.12500393390655518, 0.12500393390655518, 0.12500393390655518, 0.12500393390655518, 0.12497247010469437, 0.12500393390655518, 0.12500393390655518, 0.12500393390655518], "Beta": [[0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.14798128604888916, 0.10085640102624893, 0.007749422453343868, 0.018208162859082222, 0.17147237062454224, 0.14778991043567657, 0.0011073119239881635, 0.17817257344722748, 0.16213756799697876, 0.06359198689460754, 0.0009329696767963469], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136], [0.1479831039905548, 0.10085718333721161, 0.007748558185994625, 0.018206769600510597, 0.17147208750247955, 0.147792786359787, 0.0011072733905166388, 0.17817004024982452, 0.16214005649089813, 0.06358925998210907, 0.000932897615712136]]}
