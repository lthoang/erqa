Canon sticking that green ring around the barrel suckered me into buying one of these. Over the two months I used it, this lens always frustrated me with it's poor image quality and it's heavy front element that would zoom the lens and change the focal length. And although much of the literature talks up how the \"\"DO\"\" diffractive optic technology has made a shorter length lens than otherwise possible, with the hood attached and the lens extended, it effectively saves less than an inch of length.I wanted to like this lens so much, and figured that for the hefty price is must take good photos, but I was wrong. In the end I sold this on the used market, and bought the 70-200mm f/4 IS, which is the same price as this lens. The 70-200 doesn't zoom as far, and is physically bigger, but is such a wildly superior design that I have never missed this DO lens.I don't like writing such a negative review, but I really was very disappointed with this lens. I gave it a fair shot, using it for over a thousand photos over two months, and I have no regrets selling it afterwards. Divert your funds and attention towards either theCanon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USMfor half the price, or theCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USMfor the same price.\"", "\"Judging by Amazon customer buying behavior, it's a toss-up between this lens and theCanon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM(AKA non DO 70-300mm). So why would you pay twice the price for the Diffractive Optics (DO) lens?1. Image quality2. Weight and LengthI have used both lenses, and the 70-300mm DO IS is the one that I purchased.The DO lens produces sharp, contrasty, aesthetically pleasing images. It is ever so slightly soft at exactly 300mm, but this can easily be fixed with mild sharpening. The non-DO lens is softer, shows distortion towards the edge of the frame, and produces \"\"flatter\"\" (lower contrast) images. I had to sharpen, correct and tweak the contrast of every single image from the non-DO lens.This lens weighs 720g (1.6lb) and is less than 100mm (3.93in) long when closed. The non-DO lens is 630g (1.4lb) but 144mm (5.6in) long when closed. The DO lens is slightly heavier, but not by much -- about the weight of a \"\"candy bar\"\" mobile phone -- but far shorter. This makes it more practical for travel and other work outside a studio.I'd make the same choice again in a heartbeat. I have now taken many thousands of shots with the 70-300mm DO IS, and couldn't be happier -- sharp, strong images that don't require a lot of post-processing.\"", "I found this lens to be superb.  Fast focus, very good image stablizer, sharp images.  However, I also found the zooming of this lens to be stiff and not very smooth. I was told this was due to the design of the lens with the weight of the glass toward the filter side of the lens.The solution I came across is to use a collapsable, rubber glare hood which I attached to the front of the lens. When the hood is collapsed, I can grasp the lens barrel by this rubber hood and zoom in and out with great ease.  The collapseable hood, when fully extended, also serves to prevent glare spots that others report.  Sure, this shouldn't be the case for such an expensive lens, but this is a very simple and functional solution that makes this lens' zoom characteristics much smoother.", "I bought this lens at the same time I bought the 20D -- when the camera was first sold. It's not the lightest lens around, but it's compact, quick focusing and has few if any discernible faults. It doesn't stick out in a crowd, at least until you rack it out with the hood on.It was one of the early choices when I decided to move up to SLR Digital from other types -- and the old reliable 35mm SLRs.I'd buy it again and I plan to use it on a 5D when it arrives, for a trip with me and the 20D, This is core travel lens for me. As for quality, it's very good. I own some Ls, but this dances in the same league. I was a professional who cut his teeth on Nikon Fs (and used other cameras up to 8x10). I've used optics from Leica to Nikon to Goerz. If your images aren't sharp, consider that it may be user error.I mostly use autofocus, but frequently switch to manual and it fits the hand well either way. The balance is good.I don't see the softness at 300mm others refer to, but typically there are sweet spots of f stop and focal length with zooms. Every lens has some inherent compromise -- fast or slow, fat or slim. I don't observe any softness, but I shoot only in RAW and do image processing outside the camera. JPGs are useful or unavoidable in places, but pointless if RAW is available.I do large prints 13x19 or larger and the image holds together as well as anything else I've used.FWIW, in the first few days I owned this lens, I shot a long series on sea birds feeding -- and the images contained details I couldn't see clearly while shooting (more common than admitted). But the smooth zoom and auto focus made composition on moving objects easy. The camera lens combination was perfect. Better equipment does not makes you a better photographer, but it can help a good one. The image stablization is very good. It's great for sports photography, but remember that autofocus is sometimes not the answer (and sometimes the only rational answer).It has a hood and bag supplied. I sometimes use a rollup rubber hood that fits across several lenses. The hood self-packs nicely in an event.On the 20D (and others with the same sized sensor), this provides an equivalent to 112-480mm. If you intend to use a teleconverter, don't even consider the Canon unless they have a new one. It doesn't fit. I have a 1.4x and it works well with exposure and autofocus and extends the reach to 672mm. I'm not a big fan of this, but FWIW.I typically travel with this lens, a 10-22mm EFS zoom (which won't fit the 5d), a Tamron 18-200, the 100mm macro, and a 35mm f/2 as a base lens. At some point, for travel at least, I'll sub the 24-70mm. Add two bodies, some computer junk. I won't decide on the kit for the 5D 20D combo for a while, but this one stays.Weight. For some people, this is a bigger deal than they know. A camera bag weighs nothing for the first 20 minus. This lens and camera can get heavy. I don't find it a problem, but some might prefer a less compact design with the DO.", "I spent weeks in forums reading up on this lens, and always seemed to come across a mixed bag of comments about it. I've had it for about a month, and I have taken a good amount of pictures with it. It does take great pictures, all the way up to 300mm. There is a touch of softness at 300mm, but this can all be taken care of using an unsharp mask in Photoshop/Paint Shop Pro/etc..... As a matter of fact, this lens seems particularly receptive to sharpening. People swear by L lenses, but if it's between this lens and say the 70-200mm IS you're talking about a minimal difference in sharpness out of the camera, and the 70-200mm IS costs more with less of a range. The DO is also black, and the DO technology enables it to be much smaller than you'd expect. At full zoom it is smaller than the 70-200mm IS or non-IS!! I took this lens to a NY Mets baseball game, and did not stick out like a sore thumb. YOU CAN TAKE THIS LENS ANYWHERE!!! The image stabilization is great, and has 2 modes you can use.I am very satisfied with this lens. Don't let the L snobs sway you away.I bought this for 1169.95 and it's $30 drop to 1139.95 was refunded to me by Amazon. I wouldn't shop anywhere else.great lens, great place to buy.", "I bought this for my wife for our safari in Tanzania and I couldn't be happier.  She shoots with a 20D and previously used a EF 70-200 F4 L lens which she found too heavy.  She used to get blurry pictures because she couldn't keep that lens still while shooting, but with the EF 70-300 DO she gets consistently better pictures, less fatigue, and I'm happier because she's happier :)  She got several pictures that I missed because I left my even bigger and heavier EF 100-400mm lens in the truck while we were walking around, but she brought her camera and got the shot.Other than her being happy, I like this lens because it's not as bold as the white lenses, which makes it easier to snap some candids of people without them noticing.I don't really like the zoom ring, it's a little too stiff and I found myself struggling to get the zoom I wanted. Maybe this is because it's new, but I'd prefer it to be a little bit looser.I wish it was just a little bit faster. F4.5-5.6 is okay, but it would be perfect if it was a stop faster (of course it would be twice as expensive too).I feel like I got a fair deal for the lens. Of course I would have loved to buy it for less, but I feel like I got good value for my money.  This lens for a happy wife is probably worth it :)", "I was looking for something to extend the reach of my Canon 18-200mm lens. I tried the 100-400mm and loved it, but found it just too long and too heavy for normal use. I tried the Sigma 150-500mm, but it was even longer than the Canon 100-400mm. I also tried the 70-300mm USM IS (non-DO) lens, but did not like the length of that lens either, so I ended up buying this lens. There are a lot of things I like about this lens.1. It is short. It is, in fact, shorter, when closed, than my 18-200mm lens and a little easier to carry.2. Even with the lens extended to 300mm, it is still relatively short. Especially if the lens hood is either reversed or removed from the lens.3. The lens has a locking mechanism to keep it from extending when just walking around.4. The pictures, out to about 250mm, are clear and crisp.5. The colors are vibrant and true.6. The USM is quiet and quick.But there are also what I see as some shortcomings.1. Pictures taken at above 250mm or so are a little soft. I mounted the camera and lens on a tripod, set the mirror lock-up and attached a remote release. But even with all of that the photos at 300mm are a little soft when viewed above 50% magnification. And, of course, pictures that I took at 300mm hand held also had some camera movement as well as being a little soft. This makes it difficult to get good pictures by cropping something small out of the photos.2. It is heavier than the non-DO version (25.4 vs. 22.2 oz).3. I found that I had a more difficult time holding my camera steady with this lens than the 100-400mm that I tried earlier. I assume that is because the lens is short and cannot easily be held from both front and back to steady it.4. As other reviewers have written, the lens lock switch is not accessible when the lens hood is mounted reversed. Since I keep the lens hood mounted all the time, this means that I cannot lock it when I put it into my camera bag.5. It is an expensive lens.But, even with all of the shortcomings I am happy with this lens. The pictures, even out to 300mm, are good and I saw the same softness in the non-DO version as in this one. Since this lens is so short, and the throw is not great, it is easy for me to forget that the lens is extended to 300mm. If I carry my monopod with me, or use a tripod, the softness is not visible unless the photo is viewed above 50-75%. And, perhaps most importantly, the lens is easy to carry and so I will be able to use it when walking in the National Parks. I would have rated this lens as 5 stars instead of 4 had the photos been sharper at 300mm. I think that this is an expensive lens and, for the price, expected sharpness throughout the range. It is not an L lens, but the price is close and I thought the picture quality should be as high everywhere in its range.UPDATED 10/3/2010:A week ago I replaced my Canon 500D with a new 7D. I had not expected that changing my camera would have had any effect on the quality of the images from this lens, but it certainly did. Before, as I wrote, the images taken above 250mm were a little soft, even when taken with a tripod and mirror-lockup. But all of that seems to have gone away when this lens was mounted on the new 7D. Images all the way out to 300mm are now clear and sharp. The color and clarity, always good, are in no way diminished on the 7D.I can only attribute the change to the ability of the 7D to focus more accurately than my copy of the 500D. Perhaps that is an innate problem with the 500D or perhaps my copy just was out of wack somehow. In any case this lens now produces very sharp photos for me and I am very happy with it.I tried to change the rating of this lens from 4 stars to 5, but the Amazon software did not reflect the change, so I will say again - mounted on my new 7D this lens is very sharp. Add to that the fact that this lens is short and easier to handle than the 70-300 IS (non-DO) version and the result is a combination that I am very happy to have.", "This is a review from another person who makes a living in the media (photography, video, film, world). I chose this lens because of the compact size and the quality of the build. It has not let me down on either my 5d MIII, or 6D. I have lenses for outdoor use during the day, then low light and indoor. This one is best for day, or a proper lit stage.Being able to take it anywhere and being able to blend in is a must. Whenever I get my other &#34;L&#34; lenses out, people seem to migrate to me and cause distractions when I am working. This lens added quite a bit of production value to my work and allows me more freedom the the larger, bulky choices for the same result.There is a little softening in the lens which works quite well for portraits, all other I sharpen in lightroom. Nice Sweet Spot at F8.0 as well.", "I purchased this lens because I do a lot of candids and 200mm is just not good enough. I also recently purchased a 5D MkII, so any praise I may have for the lens may be partly due to this camera. When I read some reviews of this lens, I was worried that it was weird. I will mostly address these issues.  Is it heavy? No. I use a monopod and hand carry a 100-400 lens without problems. This lens is only 52 mm at the front,so it has amazing reach for its size.  Does the zoom feel heavy? No.  The zoom needs some resistance, since the front of the lens would extend by itself if it was too light on the zoom control.  This is the same issue you have with the Sigma 18-200, another great all purpose lens for candid shots. Both lenses have a lock button that keeps the lens from extending when you not taking pictures.Lastly and most importantly does the diffraction type lens cause any problems? No. I have literaly seen no problems with lack of sharpness or unusual flare. I think you would have to shoot  tripod test scenes to reveal this. Using a monopod in real life conditions,the issue does not appear to exist. Admitedly with back ligthting you can get some fogginess and flare,but this is just like other lenses. I think some ot the reviwers who are critical spend too much time bench testing.  When I am  doing candid,or travel photography,especially with a full frame camera,this may become my main lens.", "\"I use this lens on a Canon XTi.  On that camera it's in effect a 98mm - about 480mm lens.  I also use aCanon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras.  They rate about the same.  Both have excellent image Stabilization and great optics.  I'm generally torn between the two on which to leave on the camera.  This lens is a tiny bit soft at 300 (480 on my XTi) but it has never been an issue. I thought about buying one of Canon's 70-200L series, but they are huge, white, and heavy.  Besides I have the 400mm `L' series lens and $$$ goes just so far.December 22, 2007 - Still a great lens.  It's been in use for 4 months and not a flaw.  Highly recommend.  Not the 70-200 IS \"\"L\"\" series but only in that the 70-200 is f-2.8.  But the IM makes up for most of that.You will be happy with this lens, try it.February 2008 UpdateSanta brought a Canon 40d to which this lens is attached most of the time.  The lens quality on the 40d is even better.  Has the actual quality changed?  No, but on the 40d it's more usable do to high usable ISO settings.  The XTi now carries the Sigma 10-20mm full time. [Note: The Sigma 10-20 super wide is a GREAT lens as well]  No lens changing in the field.  I have a choice of 10 Canon and Sigma lenses, what does using this lens almost full time tell you?  Right, you'll be happy with it to.May 1, 2008 Update.  Now the most used lens on the 40d.  Visiting Yosemite National park and at 300mm the shots across the valley of Yosemite's Upper, Middle and lower waterfalls (all one set of falls) are breathtaking with this lens.  This is a location where the only way to view all three falls in one picture, is to shoot across the valley.  Worth the $$$.May 2009 -  Graduated to the Canon 5D mark II -  this is a great lens on a full frame camera body as well.\"", "\"I got this lens (used) for a good price here in Amazon, after returning the 70-300L which was an attention hogging brick that was way too heavy to carry around. I was a little worried because people complained about it being soft and not as sharp as other zoom lenses of lesser price.After chasing my dog around and shooting some great shots of flying birds I'm convinced that I made the right choice. The lens is indeed sharp and produces great photos, I compared the pictures to those I took with the big white L lens and the quality was better in most pictures and overall better than expected.  The best part of this lens is its size and weight, not to mention its great construction and feel. I can take zoomed range photos without that obvious white barrel sticking out of my camera.I do have some negatives about it: 1st, the lens creeps often when not locked at 70mm, when i carry it on my neck srtap, or when shooting over-head or pointing down, you must have a close hold on the zoom ring to maintain the range desired. 2nd, it is not weather sealed, for a lens this expensive i would expect L caliber type of weather protection... Not there. Lastly, the lens hood it comes with looks odd and I never really use it because it defeats the purpose of having a compact size lens.I've had the lens now for a few months and I'm pleased, I was told that the 70-200 f4L IS would be a better bang for my buck, since it produces such sharp images, and although I would like to see that, I think about carrying that lens versus this one and being mobile sound better to me. Even if the other L lens produces a bit more sharpness.Moral of the story, if you want to move around, shoot hand held, carry other lenses and still be able to have a good zoom lens in your bag, then this one is for you.UPDATE 11/17/2011: To satify my curiosity, after reading reviews from the \"\"professionals\"\" at dpreview, I went ahead and rented the 70-200 F4-L, which is known to be the \"\"king of image quality\"\" for L class lenses, and guess what? The difference in IQ between the DO and the L lens is not significant at all, though there is SOME difference, it's nothing that cannot be easily tweaked in post-production. This is not the first time that I confirm that \"\"pro\"\" reviews are slanted and you must do YOUR OWN testing to see if the product generates the results YOU expect.
