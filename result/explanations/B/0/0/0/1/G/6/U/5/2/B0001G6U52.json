It takes excellent photos with vibrant color, and of course the 10x zoom is wonderful. There is only one reason why I did not give it five stars, that being that it does not perform well (or at all) in low-light situations. My first digital camera was an Olympus C2100 (also a 10x zoom lens), and it took absolutely outstanding low-light photos. Otherwise the S1 IS is excellent.", "\"I bought this camera to replace a nearly five-year-old Olympus D-460Z and I am quite impressed with it overall.My main criteria were high zoom and low shot-to-shot delay, and the PowerShot S1 IS satisfies both criteria extremely well...and more. It has controls for every aspect of picture-taking that I could ever want to adjust. The commonly used functions are usually only a button press or two away rather than buried in the menu system.The movie mode is quite useful rather than just a gimmick. I can definitely see myself leaving my camcorder at home in situations where movie-taking opportunities will be few and far between.My D-460Z supports alignment guides for panoramas (when using Olympus-branded flash cards), but I'm blown away by the PowerShot S1 IS's \"\"Stitch Assist\"\" implementation. For every shot after the first, you are presented with a dimmed version of the overlapping one-third of the previous shot with which to align your next shot.I really like that this camera uses standard AA cells. It will save me a fortune on extra battery sets vs. the Li-ion batteries used in several other digicams.I wish Canon had opted for a USB 2.0 or Firewire interface because the files -- movies, especially -- take forever to download over USB 1.1. This fact did not detract from my rating because I find the workaround to be perfectly acceptable: a USB 2.0 or Firewire CompactFlash reader.I do have a couple of nit-picky focus-related complaints. First of all, I find the autofocus to be very problematic in incandescent room light, which leads to many out-of-focus shots because even the manual focus is difficult to use in that light. Also, it's very awkward to use the manual focus with the electronic viewfinder due to the placement of the omni control; I wish they had put the manual focus up/down controls more toward the front of the camera.\"", "After considerable research I purchased the Canon S1 IS camera from Amazon about a month ago along with the Lexar 12X 256MB Compact Flash memory.  It arrived even before Amazon said it would!  This is my first digital camera and so far I am very pleased with it.  I wanted a camera that would take good travel pictures and images of grandchildren who often don't like cameras near them.  I expect to print the better pictures as either 4x6 or 5x7 and occasionally 8x10s.  At first I was reluctant to consider 3.2MP cameras but my research showed that a figure of merit for a digital camera should actually be proportional to MP times the optical zoom factor squared.  This gives a heavy weighting to optical zoom (it's related to picture area) and it also means that you can avoid considerable cropping and wasting of MP.  That's why people are often surprised that this camera does so well against its higher MP competition.  It's also adequate for printing my size pictures. Unfortunately, most hand held 10X cameras used at maximum zoom also need to have a shutter speed of 1/400th of a second to avoid picture bluring caused by camera shake so that you can use this 10X feature only in bright sunlight, unless you support the camera.  The Canon S1's image stabilization system allows hand held pictures with much slower shutter speeds so it is useful more often.  I always leave it on and I've taken sharp pictures of ducks, birds, and, oh yes, our grandchildren at a playground.  Our daughter, who is a professional photographer, has even commented on the quality of these candid shots, something she did not do with my film camera with lower power zoom.  Independently, I also purchased a lightweight RipVan100 battery charger that can operate at overseas voltages and I carry around an extra set of charged NIMH AA batteries, just in case, although I've yet to need them.  Of course, in a pinch, I can always use universally available AA batteries, another feature of this camera.This camera, like all 10X zooms, uses an electronic viewfinder.  I find that it is hard to see well in bright sunlight (especially if I'm wearing sunglasses), even at maximum brightness setting.  Its resolution is also poor and the images often seem overexposed - but, and this is important, the images don't shake at 10X with the IS on! and the actual pictures are correctly exposed. The swiveling LCD screen grows on you and you can take pictures looking down at the camera at waist level.  The grandchildren may not even realize you are actually taking their picture, adding to the candid effect. I haven't found the lack of an autofocusing lamp to be a problem in dim light and you can always set the manual focus to about 8 feet (no zoom used) and everything from 4 feet to infinitity will be sharp.  (I got this tidbit from my research).After it was announced but before it was readily available the camera received so-so reviews but the recent user reviews from those who actually own and use one have been highly favorable and I agree with them.  It's well made, not too heavy, and the basics can be learned quickly.  Advanced users can find many features to investigate and I'm still learning how to use some of the exposure and focus lock modes for special cases.  I think that using the Auto mode (or the Program P mode) with IS on will work for most people, most of the time.  And, as an added bonus, you can even take movies (9 minutes/1GB at best quality) if you have a large memory.  I'm glad I discovered this &quot;fun&quot; camera.", "\"I bought the Powershot S1 IS in Oct. 2005 to replace my Canon T70 film camera.  I really like this camera, and here is why:1) It has an \"\"Auto\"\" mode so that my wife and kids can use it without worrying about flash, f-stops and shutter speeds.  OK, almost all digitals do this.  ;-)2) But, you can change to Program AE, Tv, Av or fully manual mode.  Now we're talkin'!  I'm all for point and shoot ease when it comes to family snapshots, but sometimes I like to get creative with a sunset, moonrise, night shot, fill-flash, silhouette, etc. and this camera can handle it.  It's got up to a 15-second shutter, which is longer than many in this class.3) You can add narration comments to photos, which I find handy when documenting something that the picture alone does not explain.  Like, I do genealogy photos so I want to say who lived there or whose grave marker that was, or whatever.  You can download the comments to the computer as a WAV file as well.  It's like taking notes while you're recording the scene.4) Movie mode is *almost* a replacement for my Sony Digital8 camcorder.  Other than the camcorder recording in stereo and having better low-light sensitivity, the Powershot S1 can handle most of what I use a camcorder for.  Image stabilization and zoom while recording are bonuses in this camera class.5) No lens swapping any more.  With the 10x zoom from 38mm to 380mm, there's no need to carry any lenses with it, although you can get a wider wide angle and a longer telephoto, but why?  If you're that into photography, you should be looking at digital SLRs anyway.6) Vari-angle LCD makes it so much easier to get an angle that you can't when the LCD is attached.  Shoot over your head, from your feet, around a corner...  not many cameras in this class can do that.7) Stitch Assist mode.  OK, this was a feature I liked in particular that you may not care about.  But I like to take panoramas, and with the T70, I was guessing how much overlap I had, what the exposure should be for each shot, etc.  With the Powershot S1, it locks in white balance and exposure on the first frame, then shows you 1/3 of the last frame in the next shot so you can line them up.  I can do hand-held panoramas all day!  :-)OK, so there were a few negatives that I'll share too:1) There's no hot shoe for my Vivitar flash, although you can buy a Canon flash unit for this model.  But I probably won't because I think the built-in ~15 ft. flash range will be all I need.2) Speaking of that... flash pictures that you take from about 5 feet and closer seem to be washed out in the highlights.  That may be because the sensor is reading the dark background and overcompensating.  But you can manually adjust the flash power, which I set to about 1/4 on the scale and that seems to cure the problem for close ups.3) A low-light focusing lamp would help.  I had some trouble on Halloween eve focusing outdoors with natural light.4) I think I like the pre-flash type of red-eye reduction rather than the little LED light that's on this camera.  It doesn't seem to take care of red-eye in all cases (like when people are not looking directly at the camera), but it works OK in most cases.I believe the newer Powershot S2 takes care of some of these issues, but then again, it's almost 2x as expensive at this point in time.When you buy this camera, you will need a case and a memory card for it.  I bought the Tamrac 5693 Digital 3 Bag here on Amazon, which fits the S1, an extra set of batteries, an extra memory card, and the camera's video cable.  I've heard that the Canon PSC-70 bag is on the small side for this camera.  The memory card I bought (here on Amazon again) was the SanDisk SDCFH-512-901 512MB Ultra II CompactFlash Card, which has plenty of space for what I need and is a pretty fast card.One other thing you'll probably want to buy is some NiMH batteries.  I didn't have a charger either, so I bought a package of 8 2500ma Energizer batteries and a nice Powerex MH-C204W charger for about $50 at [...]I came away with this whole setup for about $375, which I think was a great deal and well worth the convenience and quality that I got.  I considered the Panazsonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 too, but I liked the Canon features and the fact that it used cheaper AA batteries and CF card.  So the big 35mm bag sits in my closet now and this little camera goes everywhere with me.\"", "I've had this camera for about a year now and overall I'm still quite happy with my purchase. The drawbacks to this camera are common with all digital models I've tried and the picture quality is quite exceptional. Here's some more details...First the pros: It's very ergonomic, well-designed, and easy to use, even for first time digital camera owners like me. The 10x zoom works smoothly and very well. In good light the auto focus locks on quickly and the pictures turn out great, even when blown up as large as 8x10. With the right paper in the printer I cannot tell the difference quality-wise between these pix and my old film camera. I really like the flip out monitor screen for shooting pictures over crowds (e.g., at sporting events). It's very visible except in harsh, direct sunlight. The image stabilization works well, eliminating the need for a tripod in most situations. Sports mode gives clear action shots even when your subject is moving quickly. The self-timer is a nice feature too. Images are easy to download to the PC (with XP you don't even need the software that comes with the camera). The built in flash works better than I expected (up to ~10' away anyway).Now the cons: In low light situations the camera is extremely challenging to use. First off, the viewfinder is electronic and you cannot see what you are aiming at through it or the LCD monitor. In night or auto mode close-up pictures come out okay, you just have to guess at your aim. Longer shots do not work out well at all. At my son's Christmas concert last night I snapped 43 shots. 5 turned out well and 2 more were usable. The rest were garbage. Anytime the kids moved at all, the shot turned out blurry no matter what mode I had it set on (and I tried several), even with a tripod. This was extremely frustrating!! Further, like most digital cameras there is a significant delay between when you push the button and when the picture is actually snapped. It is very hard to take sports shorts unless you get lucky with timing or use the movie mode.Other stuff: you'll want to purchase a larger memory card. 32mb just doesn't cut it. I went with 256 and have been very happy. You also want to purchase some rechargeable batteries. This thing takes 4 AA's and really chews them up fast, especially when you are using the monitor and zooming a lot. Be sure to use the lens cap strap. It's designed to slide off when the camera is turned on (a convenience?) yet it tends to fall off at odd times since it does not snap in place. Don't buy the Cannon camera bag. It is poorly designed and overpriced.", "Our PowerShot A20 served me and my wife extremely well. However, we upgraded to the PowerShot S1 mainly for the increased megapixels, 10x optical zoom, and ability to take better night photos. The S1 has not disappointed. It's taken excellent night photos. We've also been extremely pleased with the zoom. We're only beginning to learn the many features of our new camera. Also we have been pleasantly surprised with the battery life in the S1...we bought rechargable Energizer 2300mAh batteries. My only minor issues are with the lens cover. It falls off from time to time, so I'd highly recommend attaching it to the carrying strap. Also, I've never been a big fan of aiming with the display, so I was disappointed to find that the viewfinder is also an LCD. In bright sunlight it's sometimes hard to aim.Overall after two months of use we love the S1 and would highly recommend it.Additionally, based on reviews/recommendation of other S1 owners, we bought the Tamrac 5693 camera case. It's a great compliment to the S1.", "I've had the S1 IS for about 6 months now and I am very happy with the camera.Positives: Very easy to use; awesome video quality + sound; good picture quality; image stabilization feature seems to work well; nice variety of shooting modes; 10X optical zoom will spoil you; omni positional screen will become a must have for future cameras.Negatives: 3.2 MP is OK, but more is always better, especially if you are going to blow up and/or crop your shots; macro mode would be nice; sometimes camera seems to search too long in mid to low light in auto mode - picture quality can suffer.I've not yet explored even half of the camera's features.  I've been very happy shooting stills mostly in auto mode and video.  Camera can do a lot more if you ask it to.I'd definitely recommend this camera, or the S2 if you want to spend a bit more for more MPs and other features.  I added a 1 GB flash card and two sets of rechargeable batters, neither of which I could do without.  You'll need at least a 500MB card if you plan to shoot much video.", "Received as a birthday gift in 2004. I was unaware of the PowerShot S series at the time, but have the PowerShot G2 model.Have had the PowerShot S1 IS for over 5 1/2 years now and still works great. Its LCD went black (known malfunction) in June 2008 and sent to Canon to have it repaired. It was well out of warranty, but had replaced free of charge because of the defect. Received it a few weeks later and has worked as it should ever since. For some reason, its picture quality is a smidgen less from before the repair. I have recently purchased Panasonic DMC-ZS3.Overall experience...- Taking photos of the snow comes out clear and not too blue under ambient sunlight. Takes great sunset photos without the flash. Once took many photos of the Moon - even lunar eclipse twice, with decent results on maxed zoom. However, it takes trial and error because focusing is difficult with dark/bright subject.- Picture quality very good, but has compression artifacts and some grain/noise.- Movies are quite yellow and grainy under incandescent lighting, but much cleaner and whiter under fluorescent. Does surprisingly well in grayscale (B&W;) on well-light highways at nighttime, especially in the rain and snow (albedo effect helps?). Recording movies has subtle-bright vertical bars, i.e. chandelier, tail/head lights, and sun (says a phenomenon with CCD in the user manual), but as with any given CCD camera, these bars aren't recorded in the photos.- Excellent movie recording at the time of this model, but mono sound to the newer S2 IS (I don't have that camera).- Don't record movies with alkaline batteries - after two minutes, they are exhausted. With NiMH Duracell batteries, once I recorded about an hour of movies before the low battery light came on display. Have not tried lithium.- Recording movies with high-capacity card works well, but using a standard (not high-speed) card will cause corruption, or more likely, intermittent dropped frames, especially when moving or zooming quickly on the fine setting. Use of 640 X 480 @ 15 fps on any speed card recorded w/o problem.Suitable with the neck strap and small case, but not for carrying in your pocket (why I purchased the Panasonic). I would recommend this camera, and if you do buy it, check for firmware updates and watch out for any LCD defect. If the camera's viewfinder starts flickering intermittent green/purple blotches, it is a matter of short notice the display will go black, needing repair.Camera Window has a tendency to malfunction on PC and Mac (uncertain of its known issues), but when it works, copying the data is straightforward, but will copy 1-2 megabytes per second via USB.Hope this review is helpful. Overall, I'd rate this camera B to B+.", "\"I have been an amateur photographer for many years.  My favorite type of photography is \"\"nature\"\", especially birds.  I used to mainly use a Nikon N90S with various lenses and such.  But that gets heavy and hot in the Everglades.I have been using the S1 now a month or two.  I absolutely love it.  The zoom power is wonderful for that long bird shot.  You lose some resolution using the digital zoom though, but that's expected.  It's a light camera but you can still handhold long shots thanks to the image stabilization.  I use a monopod most of the time now.It's almost like an SLR, with the digital viewfinder!  Using the back screen that most cameras have is difficult in bright sunlight.  The digital viewfinder in the S1 is still a minor difficulty in bright sunlight, but very usable.  All the functions are pushbutton, and settings visible in both screen and viewfinder.Functions at this price level are amazing.  I am very very happy with available options.  It has a \"\"one button preset\"\" where you can set one button to do a chosen function.  I use that button for setting ISO speed.I use a UV filter all the time with the special adapter.  Beautiful outdoor shots.Macro capability is very good.The S1 is not cheap...but it tries very hard to be a digital SLR.  And that is megabucks there...so the S1, in a way, is a bargain.It also has a true neck strap, not a hand strap, like most digital cameras.Picture quality is good.  I have my own website and pics are fine.  3.2megapixels is ok.  I think more sensor resolution must be coupled with better optics, otherwise no point in a 6mp camera with plastic lenses.  So the S1 is fine in this respect.  Good optics, adequate sensor.Battery life is good.  Some complain about battery life.  I find it good with 2200mah Nimh rechargables.  But those who complain don't realize the first few times you use a rechargable battery the battery only has limited capacity....so it ain't the camera, it's the battery.  If you get new batteries, charge them up and stick them in a flash light and discharge them like this a few times.  Then you will get good battery life in camera.I gave the S1 5 stars.  It deserves them.If you don't need all the features or long zoom, try the outstand \"\"A\"\" series by Canon.  The A75 is a great value.  I use an old A40, and A75, and the S1 for my digital stuff.\"", "\"Overall I am very happy with the camera, but couldn't give it 5 stars because (1)No date/time imprinting function (2)Picture quality is only comparable to my old Pentax IQZoom point-and-shoot film camera.I will try to list pros and cons that are not discussed in other posts.Pros:1) Video format is AVI and can be easily played on computer.2) Tons of manual controls to set aperture, exposure, focus, etc.3) When doing manual focus, a window pops up with zoomed-in image so that you can see if the focus is good.4) Time lapse shooting and continuous shooting available (read online manual)5) Very versatile LCD. Can be flipped, twisted, and turned in many positions.6) You can take many pictures and stitch them together to make a huge picture (read the online manual)Cons:1) Regular AA batteries run out too quickly. NiMH batteries are working well.2) No functionality to imprint date/time on the image.3) You need high-speed (18X) CF to be able to shoot video in highest quality.4) Lens cap doesn't fit snugly, but can be tied to shoulder belt loop so you don't lose it.5) Doesn't fit in my existing digital camera bag - plan on buying a new one.6) LCD is too small.Recommendations:1) Bought a 4GB Hitachi MiniDrive ($170 @ outpost) and I am happy.2) Flash is adequate, but a slave flash ($20 @ Ritz) might help.3) When buying the bag, make sure it has pouches for spare batteries and CF cards. Also, make sure the camera fits in the main pouch.Updated On 12/27/2004:I bought \"\"Targus DPBC03 ProBlack Digital Camera Case Max\"\" camera bag from Amazon. S1 IS barely fits in the bag. There is a pouch to keep batteries. The pouch is big enough to hold CF card also. I am going to keep the bag, but you might want to consider buying a slightly larger bag.I tried the \"\"photo stitch\"\" functionality over the weekend. I shot two scenaries and stiched them. One came out very well - impossible to know that it is stitched. Other scene seems to need some manual work to be done - one of the shots in the series wouldn't merge well.\""], "Gamma": [0.036061905324459076, 0.03589227795600891, 0.7813577651977539, 0.039011113345623016, 0.03589227795600891, 0.03589227795600891, 0.03589227795600891], "Beta": [[0.0034991735592484474, 0.020325295627117157, 0.063021719455719, 0.051730092614889145, 0.8322787284851074, 0.007760846056044102, 0.006167649757117033, 0.008989831432700157, 0.003358307993039489, 0.0028683890122920275], [0.003477581311017275, 0.020222580060362816, 0.0627017542719841, 0.051536284387111664, 0.8330788016319275, 0.007713133469223976, 0.006143505685031414, 0.008935175836086273, 0.0033392563927918673, 0.0028518950566649437], [0.0017169758211821318, 0.024042710661888123, 0.07512683421373367, 0.02466392330825329, 0.8463337421417236, 0.00933992862701416, 0.004058523569256067, 0.01101777981966734, 0.002197457477450371, 0.001501980354078114], [0.0038692723028361797, 0.022064948454499245, 0.06844355165958405, 0.05496518686413765, 0.818748950958252, 0.008578422479331493, 0.006570985075086355, 0.009925720281898975, 0.0036831581965088844, 0.003149882424622774], [0.003477581311017275, 0.020222580060362816, 0.0627017542719841, 0.051536284387111664, 0.8330788016319275, 0.007713133469223976, 0.006143505685031414, 0.008935175836086273, 0.0033392563927918673, 0.0028518950566649437], [0.003477581311017275, 0.020222580060362816, 0.0627017542719841, 0.051536284387111664, 0.8330788016319275, 0.007713133469223976, 0.006143505685031414, 0.008935175836086273, 0.0033392563927918673, 0.0028518950566649437], [0.003477581311017275, 0.020222580060362816, 0.0627017542719841, 0.051536284387111664, 0.8330788016319275, 0.007713133469223976, 0.006143505685031414, 0.008935175836086273, 0.0033392563927918673, 0.0028518950566649437]]}
