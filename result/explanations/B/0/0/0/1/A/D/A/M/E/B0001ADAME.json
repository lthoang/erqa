The game has a great presentation, terrific sound, and amazing gameplay. However, in many cases, its flaws outweigh its good spots.Of course, you can't notice it at first, but this game is brutally short. If you are familiar with this genre, you can breeze through it in about 5 or 6 hours. And I thought Max Payne 2 was short! Once you finish the game, you will be very disappointed, because it is a very fun game to play, and it captures the feel of the west perfectly. You will run across ghost towns, menacing cowboys, and colorful environments.There is no shortage of weapons in the game, and every weapon feels authentic. Also, the gameplay is great, with smooth controls and good AI.Basically, if you have any interest in the west, this is a good investment for a game. It just may not be interesting to some people, and you may even just want a rental. I know I should have rented it instead of bought it, because I beat it in six hours, and I was bored after a few days. The multiplayer games improve the value, but still you will tire of them after a few hours.", "this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2, the warriors, bully, and the world famous gta (grand theft auto) seriesgraphics 9/10sound 8/10gameplay 7.5/10overall 8.3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever!", "\"Fans of classic westerns and gunslinger flicks will appreciate how faithful this game is to its source material, but as far as gameplay and story goes, Red Dead Revolver barely rises above being an average third-person shooter and provides just enough bloody mayhem that will appeal to even other gamers who are simply casual fans of gunslinging (like me). The game opens with a young Red Harlow at home with his father and Indian mother when they get ambushed by a group of outlaws; Red's parents are killed and Red himself manages to escape. The game then jumps to about 12 years later where a grown up Red now makes a living shooting outlaws dead as a bounty hunter. After a quick tutorial, Red begins undertaking several missions involving a whole lot of shooting in small towns, a moving train, saloons, desert mountains, underground mines, and so on. A handful of other missions even take place on horseback and on the back of a moving wagon. Red gains access to a number of sidearms (revolvers), ranged weapons (rifles and shotguns), and thrown weapons (knives, dynamite, flaming whiskey, and snake poison), all with their own advantages and disadvantages in accuracy, damage, range, and speed. Each mission begins with Red choosing one weapon in each class, but other weapons and ammo can be picked up by fallen enemies and added to his collection.Five of the missions in this game put you in control of five other characters who play their own parts in the main story: the English dual revolver wielding gunslinger Jack Swift, the rifle wielding Annie Stoakes, Red's Indian cousin Shadow Wolf with his bow and arrow, the Buffalo Soldier with a one-hit kill rifle, and the villainous General Diego with his own suped-up rifle. Playing as these characters helps keep the game from getting too repetitive and adds a little more depth to the story, which is good because it really needs it. As it is, the story is very straightforward and simple, but still manages to be a little interesting. Plus, Red himself is a rather dry character who has less spoken lines than almost any other character in the game. It's not until almost halfway through the game that we start seeing who the main bad guys are and Red begins doing all he can to hunt them down and take his revenge on them for killing his family, but even this is done with almost no emotional reaction from Red. The game's graphics are somewhat... special. During cutscenes they're purposely made very fuzzy and grainy, along with intentional screen lines and screen tears that give the game the look of a dated celluloid western film, and the accompanying music is very fitting to the genre. The fuzzy screen effects clear up during actual gameplay, but not by much; I found myself squinting a lot when shooting distant enemies and objects since the fuzziness gets worse the farther away something is.The character models look okay, if a bit cartoony and slightly blocky. The main characters and a lot of the regular NPCs look more traditional, but some of the more outlandish enemies and bosses have noticeably exaggerated features, such as a pig nosed fat guy with TNT strapped around his body and a freaky looking pale man with a noose around his neck. Other guys will have really long faces or string thin gangly arms and legs, making this game sometimes look like half Clint Eastwood western and half Looney Tunes western. Even Red with his square shaped face and whisker-like scars on his cheeks has kind of a \"\"Naruto-ish\"\" look to him. The environments, as previoulsy mentioned, are all varied and look pretty nice, but again suffer a bit from the fuzziness of the graphics. Aside from this graphic fuzziness, none of the other things I addressed about the game are necessarily bad; in fact, they make the game more unique from others. The best part about the game is its challenging combat and missions... for the most part. About 80% of the game is moderately challenging, while the other 20% can be frustrating. Lots of missions have you facing a large group of enemies and you'll have to either shoot from cover or strafe around them while shooting.Most of the enemies are easy to deal with, which is why the game throws a large number of them at you in order to make the game challenging. Plus, the enemies can be stupid at times and will leave their cover to run straight at you and then away from you. Sometimes, you can shoot right at an enemy from behind or the side, but if they're next to a wall or other form of cover, the game's somewhat lousy hit detection thinks you're hitting whatever they're hiding behind instead of them, no matter how good your aim is. Another thing that can make the game a bit frustrating is when you have to not only keep yourself from getting killed, but also keep some AI partners from dying as well, which can be a pain in a couple of missions where you fight an army of enemies and letting even one of your allies die leads to a game over. Fortunately, the rest of the game's combat is fun, and aside from the occasional hiccups in the game's hit detection, the gun combat is well done. There's nothing more rewarding than shooting at some guys with a rifle and then switching to your sidearm and scoring two or three headshots in a row.There's melee combat as well, but it's poorly implemented and awkwardly stiff, which makes a certain bar fight mission all the more unnecessary. Killing enemies nets you points in gold, which can be used to purchase new weapons, increase health, unlock new characters and levels for multiplayer, unlock journal entries, and increase the amount of time certain special skills can be used (some of these things can be unlocked after completing a mission, depending on how well or poor you did). The upgrade shop is rather strange in its accessibility: it only appears after certain missions or before boss fights, and what was in the shop the last time you visited it will most likely not reappear again until much later. Now for special skills: Red's special skill known as \"\"dead eye\"\" slows the game down (like bullet-time) and lets you target your enemy by pointing the aiming reticule at certain spots (head, leg, arm) and then fire your gun in rapid succession at all marked targets. The other main characters have their own special skills, like flaming arrows or a flare shot that signals nearby cannons to fire on the target the flare hits.A few times Red will face one or up to three characters in duels, where the game has you grab your gun, draw it, and then you go into a similar mode as \"\"dead eye\"\" where the targeting reticule will appear somewhere on the screen (sometimes way to the bottom) and you have to mark your enemies when the reticule turns red in order to score a hit because marking your target when the reticule is yellow has you miss. Missing too many times or reacting too slowly will get you shot and most likely killed when facing the tougher duelists (like the very cheap Mr. Kelly). These dueling sessions would have been better if the targeting reticule didn't drift around on its own and you had better control over it, but as it is these duels can be satisfyingly fun when you pull them off right. Overall, despite its brief story and infrequent control issues, this game is pretty good and offers a mostly fair and addicting challenge. Still, this game won't appeal to everyone and even at its current price (about $15.00 in Gamestop) it should only be purchased by lovers of western themed shooters, otherwise it would be best to borrow it from someone for a weekend playthrough.\"", "When I saw Red Dead Revolver, I thought it was Grand Theft Auto in a western setting. Well, to a degree it is, but it's also its own game too. Obviously you will notice that the graphics are in the Grand Theft auto cartoon style... Otherwise it's a new ballgame.One noticable difference from GTA is the lack of freedom. This game is very focused of action rather then walking around a giant environment. You do get to walk around town a bit and talk to locals, but don't expect to be free roaming and shooting innocents like GTA.Also, the controls are much more complicated then GTA. The most noticable thing is no auto aim. It takes a little while to get used to moving your character with one control while trying to aim with the other, but don't let that keep you from buying the game. The controls for the most part are tight and once you get used to them, the game will seem easy.If you love Clint Eastwood Style westerns or you just like bloody violent video games, then this is a essential title to pick up. You get to live all the quintessential and classic moments from western films, such as saving the train from being robbed, massive shoot outs in the ghost town, bar room brawls and more! This is the next best thing to actually being in the oldwest.Graphics=4.25Sound and music=4.25Control=4.5Fun Factor=4.5Replay value=3.5TOTAL RATING=4.2lets hope for a sequel! I'm hoping for more expansive terrain, create a gun slinger, and cooperative 2 player game mode.", "Hey, if you're looking for a vintage western shooter, this game is it. It's like one of those John Wayne movies, bad guys, Saloons and same plots, plus an ugly damsel in distresss. I didn't much like it because it was too vintage, not modern, and the gameplay was so slow, it took a total of 5 seconds to shoot a bad guy... after i pulled the trigger. But if you're a western fan, this will do for now, in the mean time, another western based on the movie Open Range will be coming out by early 2005 in PS2, PSP, X-BOX and Gamecube, that or John Wayne's Rio Bravo which was announced early this year at the E3 Show to be coming out fall of 2004.", "First off, I think a lot of people are expecting Rockstar to keep putting out Grand Theft Auto every single time they release a game.  Not exactly fair, but that shows you just how good those games are.If you are looking for a solid western &quot;shoot em up&quot; game, then you should enjoy Red Dead Revolver.  You play (mainly) as Red, a quiet yet lethal gunfighter whose family was slaughtered in front of him.  Basically his father had married an Indian girl, and the rest of the white folk didn't like this too much.  So, Red sets out to avenge the deaths of his parents (sound familiar).You make your way through different &quot;scenes&quot; and encounter different characters, although none of them really stand out.  There is a lot of gunfighting, at times it seems even the most trivial little thing will lead to a battle.  The fights are strung together by little movie scenes that progress the storyline of the game.  As the game wore on, I found myself hitting the &quot;X&quot; button everytime a scene started to play out.  In other words, the story failed to keep my attention.The controls are somewhat awkward, as are the camera views/perspective.  You control which way Red is facing with the right analog stick and make him run in that direction with the left stick.  This can be tricky and sluggish; at times an enemy will be blowing you away from just a couple feet off, but you can't change Red's direction and position fast enough to kill him.  So you end up almost dying.  Also, gunfighting can be a pain due to the odd control scheme; this takes time to get wired and even then you will find yourself getting crazy since the controls are not intuitive.  That type of thing is frustrating but overall the game has more strong points than problems.  The graphics are pretty good, lots of gritty western backdrops, tumbleweeds, saloons, etc. The whole thing moves along pretty quickly as far as load times go.  You can buy different weapons and supplies throughout the game as well.Overall I would recommend this game.  50 bucks is too much but hey just my opinion.  The fact that there aren't any other western cowboy games on the market makes this one that much more appealing anyway.  If they worked on the storyline a little more and tightened up the controls this game would be significantly better.", "This is undoubtedly my favorite Western shooter of all time.  It beats out Gun, guaranteed and I prefer it over Red Dead Redemption.", "AFTER PLAYING A FEW LEVELS ,I WAS TOTALLY HOOKED ON THIS COOL WESTERN BASED ACTION GAME !! I HAD BORROWED IT FROM A FRIEND,AND THEN  HAD TO GO RIGHT OUT TO BUY IT. YOU PLAY AS BOUNTY HUNTER  ''RED '' WHO IS OUT TO AVENGE HIS PARENT'S DEATHS. YOU GET TO RIDE ON HORSEBACK WHILE SHOOTING ,AS WELL AS NORMAL GUNPLAY TOO.. THE BEST FEATURE OF THE GAME IS THE DEAD EYE FEATURE, WHICH IS A SLOW DOWN FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN TARGET YOUR ENEMY. AND AFTER THE SLOW MOTION IS OVER ''RED '' SHOOTS AT WHATEVER SPOTS  HE MARKED ON THE BAD GUYS.THE DRAW IS THE HARDEST TO MASTER, BUT IT CAN BE DONE.THE LEVELS ARE NOT TOO HARD, BUT THE BOSSES CAN BE,ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE GUNPLAY THAT IS INVOLVED.ANOTHER COOL FEATURE IS ALL THE WEAPONS YOU COLLECT ALONG WITH THEIR UPGRADES TOO. BUT NOT EVERY WEAPON IS GOOD FOR EVERY BATTLE.THAT IS WHY THEY GIVE YOU WEAPON INFO LIKE RANGE,ACCURACY, AND DAMAGE.. SO YOU CAN CHOOSE THE BEST WEAPONS FOR YOUR UPCOMING FIGHT..PLUS YOU CAN ALSO PURCHASE ITEMS IN ORDER TO UNLOCK PAGES IN THE JOURNAL.WHICH INCLUDES LEVEL INFO, GOOD/BAD GUYS INFO,WEAPONS INFO,TERRITORY INFO,AS WELL AS LOTS MORE TO BE UNLOCKED AND READ.SO IF YOU WANT A COOL GAME THAT IS DIFFERENT AND BETTER ,THAN GET IT TODAY.'' CLINT '' WOULD BE PROUD !!!", "\"When I first saw this game, I was not interested in it due to it having a western theme, but when I noticed it was made by Rock Star, I thought I'd give it a \"\"shot\"\".Boy was I surprised.  In no time at all, I was addicted.  Not only was it entertaining, but funny.  The dialogue from your enemies while pummeling them with bullets had me rolling in tears.  The controls are great and the diffulty level was just right.  I've played this entire game twice, and I would have to place it in my Top 10 All Time Must Have Games.As always, I have to give a shout out about how bad No One Lives Forever since I first wrote about it three years ago.  Sorry, but that game still stinks and I would avoid it even if it were being given away for free.\"", "No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.", "What other game allows you to play a western movie?!?!This game is so addicting.  I finished playing the game.  And the best part is when you play the game again and start a new game, all the guns, items you bought through the first time are there for you to use!!! That's awesome.  Some games don't let you carry items and weapons over to the next new game.  Great job.Also, great job on the whole ambience of sound, music and the way the graphics look.  Like a grainy western movie complete with lines through the film and dots appearing at random.I understand that some people don't like to play the game because it's linear.  However, keep in mind that it's like a movie.  A specific plot and path to complete.  The plot is a bit simple, but that's what the old western movies were made from.  Simple plot and a lot of cool shots!!So, I think this game is just fantastic.  I disagree that it was boring and repetitive.  It's fresh, fun and nostalgic.Have fun.", "\"It's been said of Stephen King before that he could publish a grocery list and it would sell a million copies.  The perception of Rockstar Games is very similar these days.  From GTA3 forward, the Grand Theft Auto series have been instant classics.  That Rockstar is promising to \"\"blow people away\"\" with the upcoming San Andreas title is a scary thought considering how far they pushed the envelope with Vice City.  With titles like State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Manhunt, they further solidified an already stellar reputation.  Here's a company who puts out games the way gamers want them.  No compromises or shortcuts, this crew clearly lives and breathes gaming and it's evident that they enjoy what they do.  These days that's something pretty special, as huge production houses churn out/rush out titles that feel like they were made by people who never played them.The point of all of this is that many people (myself included) probably went out and bought Red Dead Revolver more because it's a Rockstar game than anything else.  Sure, it hits shelves at a time where HBO's Deadwood might have rekindled some national interest in Western-style media.  But if I'm honest, I don't know that I buy this title on the first day if it's coming from EA, UBI, or some other company.In that light, Red Dead Revolver is going to be a bit of a disappointment in the long term with people who buy it before checking the reviews.  Make no mistake, the game is fun, the storyline compelling, the characters fun and interesting.  The game play is solid, the controls easy to get down, there are no major flaws with the game.  Except that it's relatively shallow.  It is as linear as games can get. There's nothing to be determined or decided, save your shot/hit ratio, the damage you take during a given chapter, and what little extras you unlock.  My experience playing is going to be exactly like yours, and yours like anyone else's.Not that this is a bad thing for everyone.  Red Dead plays like an arcade shooter.  You play as one of a few different characters, but mostly the main protagonist, Red.  With a variety of weapons (which can be upgraded throughout the game) you take down waves of opposition in a number of gritty Western movie-style settings.  A ghost town, a graveyard, up in the mountains, on a train, on a ranch, etc.  Beyond the normal aim, shoot and run, you also make use of something called \"\"Deadeye Mode\"\", which is a familiar slow-time mode where you can make a series of precise shots against one or more enemies.  The third mode of play is QuickDraw, which is just as it sounds.  The screen comes up, you pull down on the right stick, push up, and try to line up a number of shots before a slow-time clock runs out.  I would have liked to have seen this worked into the game a bit better.The game as a whole is fun once you put aside what could have been, accept it for what it is and enjoy the experience.  It is not a title I will keep long-term, once done with the single player mode, it will get traded in towards something else.  There is a multiplayer mode, but it's limited, and doesn't add (in my opinion) anything to the long term playability of the title.  I felt Rockstar could have done much more with this title.  There are times where you run around town between chapters with no real purpose.  Let me get myself in trouble at the Saloon with a bar brawl, or end up in a Quickdraw shootout because I hit on some saucy barmaid that some other tough unwashed thug is interested in.  Without some of the freedoms and depths Rockstar has worked into its other titles, you do eventually feel like you're just pulling the trigger in one chapter after another, just going through the paces until the inevitable finale with the men who killed your parents.I highly recommend renting this game before buying it.  I'm glad I played it, and I enjoyed it, but when you're done, there's nothing drawing you back in.  Even Western fanatics might not find this one worth keeping long term.  Definitely worth playing, but you might be better served hanging on to that purchase money for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas if you're a fan of that series.  Make no mistake, this isn't about Red Dead not being considered on its own merits.  I'm not holding it up against Rockstar's previous home runs, despite that being what drove me to buy it blind.  This game isn't a flop, and it's not going to ruin the image of Rockstar, but my opinion is that it's one of their weaker titles.  This game was handed off a couple times, starting with Capcom, ending with Rockstar, perhaps that has something to do with the lack of depth.Positives:Graphically impressive, everything is convincingly gritty and bleak.  Everything has a spaghetti Western-style feel to it visually.Solid storyline.Fun arcade-style gameplay.Hard enough to be a challenge, easy enough to be fun.Bull/horse riding, stagecoach driving and train-related opportunities really add to the fun factor.Negatives:Restrictively linear, no opportunity for playing outside the lines.Shallow.  I know I keep harping on this, but depth is a hallmark of Rockstar titles.No real replay value.Weak online aspect doesn't really add to the game.After about half the chapters, you start to feel like you've been there and done that.Wants to be both an action shooter and a story-based adventure game.  Doesn't really grab onto either and is sort of missing a real identity.Rent it.  Play it.  Enjoy it.  Then move on to something else.High end of the 3 star rating for me.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0233352929353714, 0.11125019192695618, 0.05530400201678276, 0.021101072430610657, 0.08439776301383972, 0.08301400393247604, 0.11644132435321808, 0.09764095395803452, 0.09566503018140793, 0.08559572696685791, 0.10776428878307343, 0.1184903159737587]]}
