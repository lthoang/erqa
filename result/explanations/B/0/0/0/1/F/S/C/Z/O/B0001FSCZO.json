However - and these are big howevers - there are a couple of issues. 1) Mine will not keep the date once rebooted. That's a problem when backup software compares dates. It keeps resetting to 1969! It will hold the date if not rebooted - but that brings us to 2) If I don't reboot at least every other day, it drops off the network. For whatever reason, the little box just won't stay up. Could be my router, who knows. and 3) CAN'T HANDLE LARGE FILES. Keep in mind this is a linux box and unless you update firmware to the latest version, both drives must be EXT3 formatted. That means no files larger than 4gb. Which means I can't copy full disk backups to the drives. What a pain.All in all worth the money (less than fifty bucks) I paid, but it's not a great solution. I'm tempted to use one of my old machines and Windows Home Server and see how that works. (END UPDATE)What a great little box. NAS on the cheap. Hooked it up, connected two USB drives to it and fired up the CD. OK, since my subnet was set up different than the default on the NSLU2, I had to direct-connect my laptop first, but so what. After that, it was full speed ahead.Within twenty minutes, the first drive was formatted and the second one, a 500gb WD, was on its way. Some time after that and I was backing up everything I had onto those drives.What I like is to have one central repostitory for the entire family's store of music, photos and videos. This thing streams all with no issues. So, so easy to setup and maintain. True 'nuff, I had some initial issues with backup, but they were all attributed my dang router. Once solved, this thing is amazing. Plus, there's tons o' mods available all over the internet. One powerful little box.Once I'm done here, I'll have two 500gb drives on it - one backing up to the other. I'll have one for the families stuff, and one for backup, just in case. Just imagine never having to explain to mom why her precious photos are now gone cause her laptop died. Or to Jr why all his 'legally obtained' music is lost due to him deleting the folder from his machine. So worth the money.", "\"There is a large hacker community out there coming up with more and more activities you can do with this very flexible device. It was an afternoon's work, but I, a person with moderate Linux skills, set up a Subversion version control system on this box (do a web search for \"\"sprinkleofcocoa NSLU2\"\" for a complete description of how to do this).  People have added serial ports, doubled the processing speed, and a good deal more. I can imagine driving laboratory equipment or model trains with this thing; the skies the limit.I've been running my svn server on this box for 3 years with nary a hiccup. It has been a very good value to me, and I recommend it as a means for low cost personal development version control.I deducted a star because out of the box, the first one I purchased soon had its ethernet port break. And, I am not sure this box is particularly good at its primary function: file sharing, what with its comparatively slow 100 Base-T Ethernet connection.\"", "I connected my ntfs drives to the usb ports, and while streaming mpeg2 videos, the connection would break in under a minute.  I reflashed the firmware from Linksys (even thought the device already has the latest), and the connection problem went away.Reading from ntfs drives is decent.  I was able to stream two 10 mbit/sec videos to two different computers without any skips or hickups.  Writing to ntfs drives, however, is VERY problematic.  Doing a lot of heavy writing to the disk causes the device to crash, requiring a reboot and also causing your disk to become inconsistent.  Even though linksys claims to support ntfs, it's practically unusable unless the drives are pre-loaded and you don't plan on putting any more files on it.The default linksys firmware does not support unicode filenames.  If you have filenames with asian character sets (chinese, japanese, korean, etc), they will be replaced with underscores (_).  To get around this, you need to use a different firmware like unslung or openslug, and upgrade to samba 3.You can also use a usb hub to connect more than two hard drives, and they will show up as hdd_1_1_1, hdd_1_2_1, hdd_1_3_1 instead of 'disk 1' and 'disk 2'.  Some of the features like backup and scandisk assumes that you're only connecting a maximum of 2 drives, so using a hub will make these tools useless-- you'll have to use a real computer to scan for errors.", "Before this device, I was backing up my computer systems via a USB port on my master computer.  My network consists of both wired and WiFi with emphasis on the WiFi.  The time it took to complete back-ups of my data took too long.  The ease of hooking of this network storage server took only minutes and it formatting of the external hard drives was quick and easy. My network easily established communications with the device.  Once Installed, I did a complete back-up from a remote computer using the WiFi, what would have taken six hours was knocked down to about two hours!  I've had zero problems with it.  I'm extremely glad that I got it.", "\"As others have reported, this gizmo is easy to set up and configure out of the box.  However, I am seeing throughput speeds on the order of 150 Kbps (average).  That is not a misprint, I typed a \"\"K\"\" in front of the speed.  It takes absurdly long to open a single digital photo and/or copy a single mp3.  It could take days to fill the device with data -- not that I've had the patience to let it run that long.Other than the NSLU2, my network hums along reliably and at high speed.  Very disappointing...so far I have spent more than ten hours installing, debugging, testing and trolling internet sites looking for a solution.  I don't have limitless time to debug the NSLU2, especially since I originally bought it as a covenience to SAVE me time.  I'll probably noodle around a little bit more and if/when I make no headway then sell it online for whatever I can get.Not recommended, even for hobbyists.  If you must buy it, ensure that you have a good return policy to fall back on.\"", "\"This is a great product *if* you're technically inclined enough not to mind hacking around with some Linux tools. Using the \"\"unslung\"\" firmware, this little device becomes a versatile server for your web site, your music, or even a multimedia recorder.It's quiet and doesn't consume much power. I use it as a music server for streaming my MP3s elsewhere in the house over the wireless network. In the past, my big noisy spare PC would be devoted to that task. Now my office can be quiet while the \"\"slug\"\" does the dirty work.If you want plug and play network attached storage, this will do that as well. You'll hear some complaining that it only mounts UNIX filesystems. That's not really a big deal if you can boot into Linux occasionally (Knoppix or Ubuntu have \"\"live CDs\"\" that can boot you without changing your system). If you really need everything to have a graphical user interface or a Windows logo, steer clear, but don't ruin the fun for the rest of us. :-)\"", "I'm happy with the NSLU2 other than the following issues which Linksys is not resolving.-- Unsuitable for Media Streaming.  Every hour or so, the NSLU2 hangs for a minute.  Definitely annoying while creating documents, etc - but completely unusable for streaming MP3s, JPEGs, MPEG Video, ripping audio CDs, etc.  I have to periodically copy all of my media to my PCs local HD for streaming out to my media players.-- Only Supports SMB.  Linux+Solaris clients must use SMB, ala Samba instead of standard NTFS. This prevents UNIX file system features such as symbolic links from being used. NTFS access was deliberately disabled from the embedded Linux running NSLU2.", "\"I've used the NSLU2 for about six months.  If you buy this product, there are a couple of things you need to know.First, when it works, it works well, and it is very useful to have a large drive accessible by all of the computers on your local network.Second, it doesn't work well with every USB Drive.  I have personally tested the Seagate 160GB drive, the Maxtor One Touch drive, and the Maxtor One Touch II drive.With the Seagate 160GB drive, it will recognize the drive only once.  If you ever reboot the NSLU2, it will not recognize the drive the second time and all of your data will be lost.With the Maxtor One Touch drive, it will recognize the drive fine, but on large data transfers, the speed will slow to a crawl and eventually you'll get an error that says something to the effect of the network path not being found.  Its very irritating.With the Maxtor \"\"One Touch II\"\" drive (which I just bought), it seems to work great.The moral of this story is that you should test your drive very thoroughly before you use this for storage of anything you don't mind losing.  Set the drive up and reboot it several times to make sure that it continues to recognize the drive.  Then, perform several copies of large amounts of data from and to the drive (copying all your mp3's and digital photographs over and over again will work) and make sure that it doesn't give you an error message.  If all that works, you probably have a drive that works well.Third, the device does format the drive with a proprietary linux based format, so you won't be able to disconnect the drive from the NSLU2 and hook it up to your computer to access your files.Fourth, make sure you have the latest firmware, or the internal clock on the device may lose time.Fifth, if you're interested in hacking the device, look for several articles at [...] that talk about how to hack into the device and add new functions.  Just search for NSLU2 at that web-page.Sixth, the device does not have a defrag function.  If you have the money, a better choice is the Linksys EFG120, which does have an internal defrag function as well.\"", "Was slightly tricky to set up if you are not using a Linksys router. My network is on a different subnet number than the default IP address of this Linksys unit. Oddly, it was not set for DHCP by default; so I had to call Linksys tech support, hook the unit directly up to a computer, change network settings & IP addresses manually, in order to configure the unit for my network router's IP numbering.After that, all went well! Works with a FAT 32 formatted drive (couldn't get it to work with a NTFS drive [although it is supposed to], but no matter, FAT 32 is just fine)! Did not have to format the drive, so it can still be hooked up directly to a PC again.", "First, I have the latest firmware installed.This is a really bad product. Most of the negatives have been mentioned by others, but the most serious to me is that it drops a network connection while I am copying a group of files from the drive, or just streaming audio from the drive. This has happened from 3 different systems in a number of different applications.It takes a long time to boot, and although it advertises on the box that you can use FAT32/NTFS, if you do then you can't make any significant administration changes (i.e. user add/delete, group add/delete... you can't even change the default admin password). On top of that, on a 100Mb/s network connection with modern drives in USB enclosures, it achieves rates of about 2MB/sec.Every Linksys product I've ever bought has been a piece of crap. Router, switch, wireless PC card, and now the NSLU2. The question, of course, is, why didn't I learn by now?", "\"There is a small but growing community of people world-wide who are using this device as a very low-cost, low-power Linux box.  If you are buying this for that purpose, it's a great product.  I love it for what it is.I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a Linux hacker enthusiast or a professional network administrator.  Mine did not work at all until I plugged in a new USB 2.0 flash drive (it didn't even appear on my network with just a USB 1.1 external hard drive attached to it).  The documentation, such as it is (mostly on the CD that comes with the device), frequently defaults to such helpful suggestions as \"\"if this doesn't work, see your network administrator.\"\"In my experience, it is a lot easier to buy a second hard drive and install it in your PC than to setup one of these on your home network.\"", "Very nice device.  Slient and cool running, it really does allow you to share USB drives on the network.  The only thing is that this device is very slow.Don't expect to start copying multi gigabyte size files at high speeds.But for small files or for streaming music, it works great!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.000175218447111547, 0.33009642362594604, 0.00011514553625602275, 0.029842879623174667, 0.285692423582077, 0.0033220984041690826, 0.0007440160261467099, 0.021894309669733047, 0.00011739513865904883, 0.0022374561522156, 0.07200973480939865, 0.2537529170513153]]}
