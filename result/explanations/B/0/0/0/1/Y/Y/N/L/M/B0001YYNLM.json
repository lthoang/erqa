Also, Nintendo is the only company to trust with memory cards...the third party developers suck.", "At last, Nintendo has released an official 8 MB memory card for the GameCube. The only way you're likely to even approach filling this card up is if you're a big fan of sports games (whose save files usually take up tons of memory). I've had a Memory Card 251 (2 MB) for awhile now, and I still have yet to fill it up, but I've had to keep a second one around for games like Madden and MVP, which usually can take up an entire 251 all by themselves. No longer! The official Memory Card 1019 is the ultimate memory solution for GameCube.", "I have no problem with this memory card . It works fine and if I ever up grade to the wii I can still use it on that system . So I guess I really like it .", "The Gamecube Memory Card (1019 blocks) should have come out sooner for the Gamecube. Before this, they released the 59 block and 251 block cards which had less space compared to this one. Fortunately, it works for all Gamecube games. I've had no problems with it and I hope to buy another one soon so I can backup my saves on my 251 block memory cards. If you had to choose one kind of memory card, go for the 1019 block memory card as it offers the largest amount of space from Nintendo. If you want a bigger memory card, you can look at the third party vendors. If you want quality, stick with the ones made by Nintendo.I highly recommend this memory card.", "It's about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information. Before now, one had to rely off-brand cards (such as the Nyko 8 MB) for large saves, and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves. A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best. (Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted). Nintendo-brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability. If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games, this is perfect.", "To see how ripped off Nintendo is, let's do a simple conversion math.The goal is to find a 1019 Blocks card has how many Mega Byte or Kilo Byte?Let us do some calculation8 Bit = 1 Byte1 Mega Bit or Byte = 1024 Kilo Bit or ByteMemory Card 1019 Blocks = 64 Mbit = 65536Kbit = 8192 KByte = 8 MByte8192 KByte / 1019 blocks = 8.0393 KByte/blockHow much is nintendo charging? $28.95How large is Playstation 2 card?8 Mega Byte = 64 Mbit = 59 blocks *64/4 = 944 BlocksHow much are we paying for 512 MByte SD, Compact Flash, or Memory Stick?Around $8.00 or even Free.And who wants 512MB cards these days?Not a lot of people, almost no one. Most people today are going for 1 to 2 GB or 4GB for flash memory for PSP, MP3, Videos, and Pictures.Lets use the $8.00 = 512MB = 60416 Blocks as of today's standard. That means 1019 blocks should cost:1019/60416 * $8.00 = $0.135Wow so Nintendo is actually over priced by 641.12% by charging at $1.00.So in conclusion:Nintendo is 18,272% over charged consumers for only 8 MB memory card, which no body even use today for any mp3 players nor USB massive storage device with even many times faster speed than this Gamecube card!!!!!The saddiest part is for those people who has Wii and want to play Gamecube games, they are forced me use the Gamecube memory cards.  You cannot save Gamecube data on Wii Internal memory nor SD cards!!!!Nintendo is creating a hazzles to consumers!!", "I can't find ways to fill up this memory card, and that is wonderful. It is the ultimate Gamecube memory card and can hold all my sports games on there while I keep the low memory games on my other cards.", "this memory card is great it can hold 1019 blocks of space and its nintendo brand so its reliable and safe some people have compliand about the memory card not saving older games that is not true at all i have many gamecube games many are older games and all of my games save on the card i dont know if it works on the wii or not i play all my games on a gamecube console not a wii a must have item for all gamecube gamers", "It always seems to be what Nintendo finally did, other smaller companies did for Nintendo's Gamecube awhile ago. With Nintendo's Memory card 1019, it carries much more memory than it previous 251 memory block card. This device seems to be more crucial than imaginative, especially for die hard gamers of the Nintendo Gamecube. The memory works very well, and the trust that Nintendo carries on this card is great. Although with all different kinds of memory cards available for the Gamecube at all different prices, many will stick with cheaper memory cards that aren't always safe for Gamecube owners. Try to stick with Nintendo and this memory card, or the cheaper 251 block memory card. You really won't be sorry.Overall: B+Value: B", "This was the same kind of card I had ages ago when I played gamecube more than anything else. Remind me of a by gone era. It works great and I've never had data loss or anything like that. These white ones have way more storage capacity than I could ever see anyone needing. I highly recommend it."], "Gamma": [0.16935794055461884, 0.16063307225704193, 0.16929513216018677, 0.1632070392370224, 0.16814546287059784, 0.16936133801937103], "Beta": [[0.12202567607164383, 0.09371685981750488, 0.18983083963394165, 0.001666162977926433, 0.09071368724107742, 0.00294587598182261, 0.136983722448349, 0.16687655448913574, 0.12511229515075684, 0.07012824714183807], [0.12308888137340546, 0.09606306254863739, 0.18379728496074677, 0.0021611922420561314, 0.0928669273853302, 0.003714947961270809, 0.1361975222826004, 0.1638432741165161, 0.12424809485673904, 0.07401882857084274], [0.1220337525010109, 0.09373992681503296, 0.18978482484817505, 0.0016713787335902452, 0.09073946624994278, 0.002954063704237342, 0.13698045909404755, 0.16684700548648834, 0.1250932216644287, 0.07015592604875565], [0.12260734289884567, 0.09540779143571854, 0.18632961809635162, 0.002100299345329404, 0.09263183176517487, 0.003624361241236329, 0.13660818338394165, 0.16451995074748993, 0.12392351031303406, 0.07224708050489426], [0.12215765565633774, 0.09408681094646454, 0.1890721172094345, 0.0017522743437439203, 0.09113206714391708, 0.0030818921513855457, 0.136908620595932, 0.1663684844970703, 0.12485339492559433, 0.0705866664648056], [0.12202578783035278, 0.09371684491634369, 0.1898309737443924, 0.0016661164117977023, 0.09071358293294907, 0.002945828950032592, 0.13698406517505646, 0.166876882314682, 0.12511159479618073, 0.07012840360403061]]}
