I want something that when I play, they'll be moments where I'll kick ass but then other moments where I need practice, forcing me to get better. And that's how all games should be. But after the recently released Ninja Gaiden and Metroid Prime 2, you got to wonder why the difficulty's being ramped up so much.Story: Basically in this game, you're dealing with Dante before we know him as Dante, the kick ass, cool oozing guy from the first one, and to a lesser extent, the 2nd one. Here, you're dealing with how he started and the rivalry with his brother Virgil.Graphics: Maybe I'm being spoiled but after playing Resident Evil 4, Star Fox Assault and Halo 2, I'm look at DMC 3's graphics with a state of \"\"meh\"\". It's not that these graphics are bad. Hell they're so neat and fit into the gothic look of the surroundings perfectly. But as a PS2 title, it's nice but you've probably seen better.Sound/Music: Always a lowpoint for this series. Dante has that cheesy one liner type voice where he has to have some pun or joke before he does something. And when the action gets going, it's not sweet epic music like Halo or energetic like the boss fight music from Final Fantasy VII, it's these horrible metal guitars.Gameplay: Ever have one of those experiences where you love doing something but you have to deal with something else while you're at it? First of all: this game is downright fun. Pulling out combos and acrobatic maneuvers with your sword or your twin handguns has never been funner. Like the Prince in the Prince of Persia sequel, he's given a lot more moves and some classics like Air Hike or Whirlwind.However.....the game is %$#^ING HARD. I mean, I literally died on the 2nd mission and almost died on the first one and I'm fairly good at the DMC series. The problem is the developers had enemies coming at you in spades with close to 5-8 at one time. In one early level, you're dealing with enemies that can actually split in 2. And of course, you have to buy special moves and your items(stuff like potions, extra men, special meter filler etc or holy water) are quite expensive. It's like the developers just made the game hard just for the hell of it and said to gamers \"\"have fun, kids!\"\". Ugh.However, if you can get passed that, it is quite fun to play and it's intentionally or unintentionally quite comical. If you have a gameshark, turn on infinite health code. Now you're a supreme badass, without the excessive dying every mission.\"", "I wrote short reviews for the first and second Devil May Cry games years ago and unlike most of my other reviews at the time, those two specific reviews do not effectively represent my true opinions on the games. I gave Devil May Cry four stars and Devil May Cry 2 five stars... those who have played those games will know that those scores are indeed flawed, so let me rectify them now. My true opinion: Devil May Cry, a classic game, should get five stars easy. Devil May Cry 2, a flawed but still fairly decent game, should get three stars. Now lets get to Devil May Cry 3, a perfect fusion of its predecessors. This game will make you love and hate it at the same time. It is a prequel to the first game showing our favorite demon slayer Dante in his younger days right before he opens his titular demon hunting shop. He is challenged by his twin brother Vergil (before he became Nelo Angelo) to a confrontation and naturally, Dante can't refuse having some playtime with his bro. Dante then sets out to stop his brother from effectively destroying the human world with the demons he has set free. The story is more meaty this time around, offering a larger number of cutscenes like the second game, but with the superior flair and classic style of the first game (and much more dialogue). The graphics are a lot like the ones in the first game, so the environments look nice and detailed, but the character designs fall a bit short compared to those in the second game. Dante in his youth has his cockiness and trash-talk meter turned up to max, which makes sense and shows how much he grows up between this game and the first one. His attitude makes for some entertaining (and corny) scenes of him fearlessly bad mouthing his intimidating enemies and making inappropriate jokes and comments in moments devoid of humor, specifically on his numerous encounters with the female demon hunter known as Lady. While occasionally funny, Dante mostly comes across as immature and annoying, and appears to be initially incapable of having a genuinely serious moment... or simply shutting his mouth. Fortunately he begins to calm down towards the end of the game. Plus, as mentioned above, this game introduces Dante's totally cool and bad@ss twin brother Vergil, who is the exact opposite of Dante in terms of personality. He is a cold, ruthless, and determined villain, as well as universally loved by fans of the series. In short: Vergil is to Devil May Cry what Albert Wesker is to Resident Evil.Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening is a difficult game. The first game was difficult to newcomers, but manageable to those who persevered, while remaining challenging. The second game was far too easy, no doubt in an attempt to be more fair than the original. Now, once again trying to learn from past mistakes, Capcom ended up making the third game twice as hard as the original could ever hope to be. Even the weakest of enemies could take half of Dante's health away with just a couple of hits, so be prepared for a world of hurt when you face off against the large and powerful bosses. Many of them have far reaching, all encompassing, nearly undodgeable attacks. The final boss battle is an especially memorable bout of infuriating cheapness and unfair difficulty. The first time I faced the final boss I was close to tears and died literally 20 times before I finally defeated him. Those who are willing to put in the time and effort will find that this game is plenty of fun despite its raging difficulty. A big reason why is the fact that the game's controls are tight and responsive, though not quite as much as the first game's. The selection of melee and firearm weapons are appropriately varied like the first game, but more numerous. You can also switch between different weapons on the fly with the shoulder buttons like the second game, only the switching is no longer exclusive to firearms and now includes melee weapons. You can also choose between four upgradeable combat styles you can activate with the circle button that expand on Dante's repertoire of demon butt kicking moves. The styles are Swordmaster (involving his melee weapons), Trickster (improving his dodging abilities like in the second game), Gunslinger (involving his firearms), and Royal Guard (allows for blocking and counter-attacking enemies). The different styles let players pick and choose the way they prefer to fight their enemies and not stay stuck with just one fighting style (I personally prefer Swordmaster and Trickster). The music is mostly the same kind you expect from DMC, which pumps you up for all the fast paced action you encounter, with more heavy metal and rock tracks this time around. In closing, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening is ALMOST the perfect game. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the insane difficulty, but otherwise the game's story, graphics, music, and gameplay is what all DMC fans would appreciate. Fans and non-fans should all get this game.", "\"I must say Devil May Cry 3 is an incredibly awesome game. I loved the original DMC immensely, and like a ton of other people, I was very disappointed with the sequel. This game lives up to the original, and expands upon it in every way.DMC3 is a prequel to the series and focuses on the relationship between Dante and Vergil. The game actually has story behind it, unlike the other two games that felt like they had a little story tacked on. The cut-scenes are great, and everything's still over-the-top and cheesy, but in a good way. With the new Style moves, the game has depth beyond button-smashing; it even encourages it with Combo style points that are awarded for your flashiness on screen, and are decreased as you use the same move over and over, much like in the Tony Hawk games.This game is extremely difficult. The PS2's Ninja Gaiden. The American \"\"Normal\"\" mode, which is the only difficulty mode available in the beginning, is the Japanese \"\"Hard\"\" mode. After you get your butt kicked a few times, the \"\"Easy\"\" mode becomes unlocked, which isn't that much easier. Trust, this game is freakin' hard. Your skill, reflexes, and brain will definitely be up to the test with this one.The graphics are completely redone and it shows. Nice graphics and special effects, and the levels are greatly detailed and the gothic theme is superb. On the sound front, the music really pumps you up and puts you in the midst of the action. Sound effects fit the bill, especially melee clings and clangs.Replay value for this game is pretty good, since with the different Styles (with two unlockables), you can play through completely different every time. The multiple difficulty levels also add to the replay, along with secret missions and weapons. Seriously, this game is going to eat up a lot of your time, and you're going to love it.Overall, this is an extremely fun game, and I'm glad Capcom did the series right with this one. If you like action games, pick it up. But if you get frustrated easily, skip it since you'll be dying. A lot.\"", "YES THIS GAME WILL TAKE THE LIFE OUT OF YOU...ITS SO HARD THAT TO A POINT IT GETS BORING....BASICALLY , YOU SPENT HOURS AND HOURS TRYING TO BEAT EACH LEVEL, THAT BY THE WAY ARE VERY HARD, VERY SHORT, WITH LOTS OF ENEMIES AND A HUGE UNMERCIFUL BOSS THATS WILLING TO TEAR YOU TO SHREADS...( YES IM TALKING ABOUT THAT CERBERUS ICE DOGGY AT THE BEGINING)....I THINK THAT GAMES SHOULD GO FROM EASY-TO MEDIUM-TO HARD AS YOU PROGRESS THRU IT...NOT FROM STAGE 1!!!! ALSO DANTE ACTS VERY STUPID!! YES I KNOW HES SUPPOSED TO BE A TEENAGER ON THIS ONE, BUT STILL TO IMMATURE FOR THE TASK HE NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH.....LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING JOKES WITH THE DEMON SOLDIERS AND CALLING THEM NAMES, AND USING THEM AS A SKATEBOARD AND SWINGING FROM STRIP-POLES SCREAMING WOOOOOOOO!!!!!  THATS JUST PLAIN STUPID CONSIDERING HES THE SON OF SPARDA..I THOUGH DEMON-KNIGHTS HAD MORE SERIOUSNESS TO THE JOB.....SHAME ON THIS SEQUEL AND DEFINITELY NOT DEVIL MAY CRY 1......", "\"why does everyone keep saying this game is EXTREMELY HARD?  and for that guy that said it took him 2 hours to get past the second level boss...that is pathetic, especially if you practiced for a week on the original.anyway, i haven't beat the game yet, but i'm on the last mission, which is just the last boss fight, so i think i can write a review now.first off, the game kicks ass.  everything from the style, to the cutscenes, to the in-game action is top-notch.  i found myself beating the levels, not just to progress in the game, but also to see what the next cut-scene revealed.  this game actually has a story, and it has its corny moments, but you just have to understand that this is just how things are going to be and deal with it.  the over-the-top action in the cut-scenes blew me away a few times, even the opening cutscene to the first level rocked my socks off and got me in the mood to kick some demonic ass.  the character models in this game are fairly well done, the main characters anyway, and the bosses.  the normal enemies are kind of low in the polygon count, but that's okay, because the point of the game isn't to stand around and look at them, it's to shoot and slice them up in the coolest possible manner.  the voice-acting in the cutscenes is surprisingly good, and the motion-captured movements are some of the best yet in any game.unlike the craptacular second installation in the devil may cry series, numero tres brings us right back to basics, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.  first off, there are numerous \"\"styles\"\" you can choose from.  trickster, which helps you evade enemy attacks.  gunslinger, which gives you some new crazy moves with your firearms.  swordmaster, gives you powerful sword techniques that are unique to each sword/devil-arm you have.  royal gaurd, a style that gives you the ability to block and counter-attack enemy attacks.  quicksilver, a style that lets you freeze time, so you can slice and dice your foes with ease.  and lastly, doppleganger, a nifty style that allows you to create a duplicate of yourself to help out in battles.  the first four styles i listed are available from the beginning of the game.  the last two are unlocked at various areas of the game.if you don't already know, the story revolves around our hero, Dante, a half-demon, half-human badass with white hair and a red trenchcoat.  i won't go too far into the story, but i'll just say that the main plot involves his twin brother, Vergil; a girl with a huge rocket launcher, Lady; a mysterious clown figure that follows Dante around, Jester; and an evil, bald man with a messed up scar on his face, Arkham.  overall, the story is about Dante trying to stop Vergil from taking over the world in the worst possible way.  that's all i'm gonna say.on to the difficulty.  sure, i've died numerous times, but this freakin' game isn't HARD.  it's tough.  you have to be fast and agile, and luckily the controls are responsive and easy to use. so what is everyone's problem?  are you just standing around, waiting to get hit?  i beat the first level in less than 3 minutes, and the second level in less than 5 minutes.  i'm not bragging, but i just think some people must be utterly terrible at videogames.  and yes, i died enough to unlock Easy mode, but i didn't go to it.  i bit my lip and kept on hacking my way to the end, where i'm at now, on Normal mode.  sure, some of the BOSSES are difficult, but the only HARD one i've fought so far is the one i'm on now, the END BOSS.  none of the regular enemies in this game are hard, so why is everyone dying?  just keep your eyes peeled and you'll be fine.  me, i jump around ALL THE TIME.  this greatly reduces my chances of being hit.  the first level i had difficulty on was....mission 7, and it wasn't too bad.  you just have to be smart about things.  and every time that i've died, it has been my fault, not crappy programming, or crappy controls, or crappy camera angles, it was just me not being quick enough.  almost every enemy and boss in this game has attacks that can be blocked, and most of them can be seen coming from a mile away.  granted, this game is much more of a challenge than the earlier installments (i'm talking about the original, because i've omitted devil may cry 2 from my memory).  but just be smart about your attacks and evasive manuvers, and you'll be fine.  don't let all the whining about the difficulty from other people change your mind about purchasing this title.  hell, even magazine reviewers are saying this is hard, but i don't see why...honestly, it's not hard.overall, this game is a great package.  packed with awesome action, in game and in cut-scenes, loaded with unlockable secrets and new difficulties, and by far the longest quest yet in the devil may cry series (right now i'm close to 18 hours and i'm at the end of the game), this game is just flat out amazing.  so, if you're up for a challenge (a fair one, i might add) then go ahead and pick this up.  trust me, if you love action, this game will blow you away...multiple times.  so, buy it and have a blast, and just remember....KEEP MOVING!\"", "\"Well another Devil May Cry game and this time, its really worth it. Anyways, i guess all the games are so far, and are very well done. However, please do not think that this game is a \"\"cake walk\"\" game like 2..because im telling you, that its not..trust me!.Devil May Cry 3 is wayyyyy better than 2 thats for sure, however, i really dont like the way they made Dante. They made him really \"\"lame\"\" like (because its not the same Dante from the other games, thats for sure) but, i guess they try. The other thing i didnt like about the game was the \"\"taunts\"\"...how stupid!..was this really needed in the game?.Anyways, the game play is great..story line very good. This game should be in your collection for PS2 no doubt about it.\"", "Devil May Cry 3 is so hard your controller will be quaking in fear as you toss it at your TV. The graphics are really good especially during the cutscenes. The few different modes of styles are really flashy and cool. But this game is diffucult if you want to buy this game you better get ready and make sure your a good gamer because when you get past the first level then it will become extremely hard. But it is a really fun game that I could recommend to any gamer that is prepared for the diffuculty level of this game.", "\"Well, capcom has made an attempt to wipe from our memories the mess that was Devil May Cry 2... and have done a pretty good job of it. Here we have DMC3, a prequil to the first, legendary game. Lets start with the good stuff first: The game has great controlls... a fusion from the first and second games, this instalment has a control scheme that just feels natural. You will find pulling off slick, super stylish moves almost second nature. The story line is more involved this time, but is still nothing too impresive... this is a hardcore action game after all, so a great story isn't tradationally required, but you can tell the developers spent more time on the story for this game then they did for previous installments. Also, and probably most improtantly, you have RPG elements in this game. Think back to previous games..... what did you like the best? The awesome sword play and killer combos? The barking blasts of gunfire you could lay on your enemies from all directions? The awe-inspiring acrobatic moves that allowed you to dodge enemy attacks? Well, now you can have more in this game with the \"\"my Dante\"\" system, that allows you to pour attribute points into any of 6 catagories (2 of which are secret and need to be unlocked) including gunslinger, swordmaster, and trickster. This allowes you to customize Dante with more of what you liked about the past games, and offers more replay value. Now to the not-so-good stuff...  The game has some pretty bad graphics. Sure, the PS2 is ancient, but still, the second game looked smoother than this. Also for some, the \"\"stylish crazy action\"\" may be a little over the top, as cut scenes have Dante doing things and saying things that are so over the top, crazy and insaine, they may make you cringe (think Neo meets Shinobi). Now... the game's largest downfall... the difficulty. Don't worry, the game is not too easy like the second game, but rather too hard. The first game was insainly difficult for newbies, but it offered fair challenge. This game is equally as hard, but crosses the line between changeling and cheep by throwing wave after wave of fast moving, strong enemies that have an extreme advantage over you. The funky camera doesn't help either... although mysteriously, the camera seems only to have awkward angles in the begining half of the game. Sure... just like the first game, there is an easy mode, but there is very little difference between easy and normal, as both are just as frusterating. Don't let this steer you away however, as you can now revisit past levels at any time to level up your abilities and collect more currency to purchase power ups (believe me... your gonna' need 'em)and the game is still one hell of a ride. Some of the most intense and visceral combat ever witnessed by human kind is locked inside this game. Once the game sucks you in, you will have very little problem looking past the flaws the game has. more or less, the game follows in the footsteps of the original while offering enough changes to make it different and memorable in it's own right. just expect to be cussing and swearing at the game as much as you love it.  If you have the spare cash however, I highly recomend it.\"", "At first , I wasn't sure about wether I should buy this game , because I thought it's just a boring hack n' slash game. But this game is nothing like that. It has lots of amazing action, and enough exploring and puzzle elements that render it an action adventure game , rather than a hack n' slash game.The storyline in this game is based around Dante trying to kill his evil twin brother , Vergil. A gigantic dark tower appears right near Dante's house , and Vergil is on top of it. He has some sort of sinister plan that has to do with the tower and Dante must stop him , but I won't say what it is so I won't spoil it for you.The game itself has some really amazing cutscenes .....in fact , they're probably the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game. They have great graphics, and they contain lots of action. you'd think that you're watching a movie !Now on to the gameplay itself . This game is the hardest game I have ever played. I'm not exaggerating. Once you lose , you have to start from the beginning of the level , unless you buy a certain item in the game that prevents that, and once you use it , you have to buy a new one , since it's not permanent. Also , the enemies and bosses in this game are EXTREMELY hard. They're all very cool , but also extremely tough , especially the bosses (which are, by the way , some of the greatest bosses i've seen in a videogame.) You'll probably break your controller more than a few times out of anger as you keep losing. I , personally , really loved the hardness in this game , as i really like tough games. However , some people might see it as a problem, so it's not very recommended to those type of people. But when you finish these hard parts in the game , it gives you a great sense of completion, and not all games do that.The combat system in this game is also great. You have 4 fighting styles in this game(you can also get 2 extra ones later) , that give much variety to the combat in the game,and every one of them grants you some special abilities. They are :1.Trickster- this style lets you dodge enemy attacks much easier than you normally do. You can do things like running on walls , dashing to the sides , etc.2.swordmaster- this enhances your ability to use melee weapons. You can do things like throw your sword at enemies, stab them with it in lightening-fast speeds, and so on. This is also my favorite style.3.Gunslinger-enhances your ability to use guns . You can do things like shoot your guns in two different directions, spin your shotgun around like a nunchuk an dfire it , etc.4.Royalguard-lets you block enemy attacks , and then release them back at them by punching them with all the energy you build up in you from their attacks.So as you can see, there is much variety to the fighting. You can pull off some amazing combos, not to mention you have many weapons , melee and long ranged alike. some of your melee weapons are a regular sword that you start out with , a pair of nunchuks with ice-powers, an electric guitar that lets you summon bats and electricity, and more. your ranged weapons will include a pair of handguns with a rapid rate of fire , a shotgun , a bazooka , and two others. Also , if you keep using a certain style , it'll eventually level up, giving you access to even more coll combos. Not to mention that you get red orbs from enemies that defeat, which can be used as money , and you can buy different items with it , enhance your guns , and buy new attacks for your weapons.All of these attributes combine to form an awesome game , that should not be missed.", "Here, finally, is Capcom's answer to its critics. While the original DMC was a great game, and a true classic in every sense of the word, its sequel DMC 2 was pretty much roasted by all and sundry, and denounced as boring by the gaming press in general. Capcom have turned back to the drawing board and kept this second sequel in development for longer, perhaps, than expected, but believe me, the rewards are palpable.GRAPHICS: 5/5Top marks go for visuals, with smooth and clean animations, INSANE levels of detail (even on the lowliest of enemies) and some really impressive backdrops. Sure, they don't seem as impressive anymore - what could better the original experiece of DMC 1? - but if you look closely at the enemies, bosses, accessories and animations, you'll gain a very fast and very deep appreciation for all that Capcom has accomplished here. Gorgeous, fluid and very, very pleasing, the neo-Goth wasteland that Dante and his cohorts occupy is nothing short of remarkable. Action cutscenes are of the type that Jet Li can only dream about, and the whole visual shebang runs along like a freight train on speed.SOUND: 3/5Not so good. Humdrum battle tunes and odd blends of metal and trance provide a well-fitting, if somewhat uninspiring, aural experiecne. Voice acting's as lousy as ever, with the younger Dante bearing more of a vocal resemblance to Steve from Biohazard: Code Veronica than anything else. Weapon effects are satisfyingly macho, though, and the demons make some pretty plausible sounds when on the receiving end of your arsenal.PLAYABILITY: 4/5Minus one for the F Word - Frustration. Dante controls like a dream - it's tighter and easier to master than before, with combos and style points racking up hand-over-fist... ...but that can't mask the fact that, in places, this game is just too damned hard. For the casual gamer, DMC 3 is a definite no-no, and if you're like me and adore this series, you'll still be put off by having to play through the same level ad nauseam before you work out how to defeat the horrifyingly difficult bosses. It's a sad flaw in a control system and in-game physics that are nigh-on perfect, but there you are.OVERALL: 4/5A beautiful game that is, on the whole, very fun to play, and very reminiscent of the excellent original title, DMC 3 is just a little too demanding for its own good to be truly considered a Classic. If you have patience, or can get it cheap, it's thoroughly recommended, but the more casual gamer will be disappointed by the unforgiving difficulty and the bland audio effects. Still, on the whole, Capcom is to be congratulated for rescuing one of its most promising series to date.Roll on DMC 4!", "\"When it comes down to this, Devil May Cry 3 is one of the best action games ever made on any platformer, the game is absolutley accurate on every basis, Controls, Visuals and fun factor.  The game has a pretty good storyline too.  What makes DMC3 the best is that it's so damn perfect, you see..Devil May Cry was an awesome, fun filled action game with some challenge to itDevil May Cry 2 was just a complete failure and the Difficulty was a joke and could be beatin in 3 hours..Devil May Cry 3 makes up for what Devil May Cry 2 was and also suprasses DMC1!!!!  The game is just perfect..Devil May Cry 3 is the best in the series and I give my hands off to Capcom, you guys really know how to make video games.  Devil May Cry 3 shines on the controlls as there so tight and perfect to get use too.  The Visuals in this game truly shines and are jaw dropping good.  The lighting effects, enemies, everything, the games visuals are running 60 fr persecond and there is no choppyness to it!!!The games Combos and Skill use are so perfect that there is nothing to complain about, there easy to get use to and learn, and the 4 choices of styles are all awesome(I did the whole game on Gunslinger)and just doing the twosome time shows how powerful and fast Dante is.  The combos and Skills are amazingly good looking and unlike DMC2, there usefull..Buying Items is a pain as you have to replay alot of missions to get that blue orb or that Gun Upgrades but there well worth it even if it's inexpensive.  Other then the games menue options, it's good..Now...........The part everyone has bin overracting to....The games Difficulty.  Yes it is true the U.S normal version is the JP's Hard mode but Capcom was doing that to please the fans since they loathed DMC2's difficulty and if the games too hard for you DON'T PLAY IT!  I will say though that the game will probably beat the living crap out of you and finish you off even after you've got a big ass kicking...but the game will get more \"\"Easier\"\" as you keep trying and doging those enemies in that certain level, As IGN said \"\"the game will kick your...\"\"  And as for that Review on GAMESPOT.com about it getting a low score cause it was too hard for him......That's just sad....Also I want to mention that this game has AMAZING CUTSCENES, some of these cutscenes put Konamies games to shame, the game does have some cheesy dioloug but the game has over all kick .... Cutscenes...This game also has one of the best opening intro to a level I've ever seen(the first level with dante in his office)Now...Lets get down to it..The Good-Superb Visuals that really show what the PS2 is capable of-loads of gameplay and variety-should take atleast 15 to 18 hours on your first try in Normal mode-Best Action Game ever and one of the best ps2 games of this year-Lots of Weapon upgrades to buy and moves to manuever-Awesome Controlls make this another + game...-AMAZING CUTSCENES..Bad-The difficulty may turn some gamers off...I thought it was just as hard as JAK2..honestlySo overall if you loved DMC1, chances are you are gonna love DMC3 even more then DMC1, the game shines on everything, Visuals, controls, cutscenes, gameplay THE GAME IS JUST PERFECT!!  Capcom knows how to make games and this is one of em'...And for people who hate challenging games...Look elswere and play Mario Gulf, it's much easier trust me...When it all comes down to this.... I give Devil May Cry 3 a...5 out of 5 stars....peace\"", "I am so suprised that after the god-awful Devil May Cry 2, Capcom was able to make this series great again! It totally gets the series back on it's feet, and I think Capcom's ready for more if they can make another sequel (this one's a prequel) that's either this good or better. Maybe not better because this one's even better than number 1! If you loved Devil May Cry 1, and you can't deny, this one will make you extremly happy.", "Ok, that was a little corny the above title, but enough b.s. This is the true sequel/prequel to Devil May Cry. In fact, they should rename this Devil May Cry 3: Let's Forget 2 Ever Existed. First off, the graphics have been rebuilt from the ground up, and is one of the best looking games on the PS2, with the only exceptions being MGS3 and God of War. Dante and the rest of the characters are very detailed. Even the enemies are decently animated(the bosses look really good though.) The cineamatics are some of the best action sequences in games, period. It's the kind that most action games and movies salivate at. 2nd, sound is great as well. Granted, Dante does come off a little too cocky for his own good, but not too annoying. The rest of the cast is exceptionally well done, seeing how this is Capcom and they have a reputation of hiring the worst actors around. This time, they did a good job. Music is a mixed bag. I liked it, but for people that hate heavy metal, they're not going to like this. But the gothic vibe is strong and really fits the game. Now the combat. DMC3 is an action gamer's wet dream come true because now, you can choose from several different fighting styles: Trickster(evasion),Swordmaster,Gunslinger,and Royal Guard. The rest is a secret. The best part is that you select 2 melee weapons and 2 long range weapons and switch through them on the fly. The combos are near endless as a result. Replay value is pretty high here, with extra difficulty levels(like it needs to get any harder,huh?), different costumes and loads of other cool extras. My only complaints are I wish the game was a little longer and its difficulty may be a little too much for the casual gamer. Overall, I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Only other game that compares to this is God of War(which I will be reviewing shortly).Sean David signing off,Semper Fi, Carry on.", "This game is highly overrated. There were some fun moments, but other games in this genre are superior. In addition, the game is hard to the point where it's not enjoyable, especially with cheap bosses and lack of precise & timely reactive control to beat them.Graphics - They are ok and the level design is actually pretty impressive. However, compared to God of War and Ninja Gaiden Black, it falls short. Cut scenes are acceptable, but dated- especially comparing to PS2-only titles like God of War and Metal Gear Solid 3. The voice-acting is exceptionally difficult to listen through.Sound - Sound effects are good, but cheesy heavy metal score is 1980s corny. Again, God of War stomps on DMC3 in this area.Gameplay -This is where the game is the most dissappointing. Although God of War was easy, there were reasons for that - one of which were controls that were tight. Let's not even bring Ninja Gaiden Black into the equation. NGB was super hard as well, but the controls were extremely tight. I recently played NGB again to make sure I was comparing fairly to DMC3 and I validated the fact that DMC3 is stupid-hard because the controls are not tight enough. NGB steps on DMC3 in this area.  Simple examples of where DMC3 falls short is not being able to roll out of the way-forward or back, but only side to side. This has a huge negative impact later in the game when you are trying to get of the way of cheap bosses. Instead of rolling out of the way you jump up right in the way of one of their huge cheap life-stealing strikes. Another dissapointing issue is there is no blocking functionality, again just plain cheap. Ironically, the non-boss characters are over-the-top easy in DMC3. There is no real balance to the game.Overall: I recommed renting the game, it is at least worth that, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you had a lot of time on you hand to get over the steep learning curve to beat bosses later in the game and also the patience to deal with the lack of control that has a negative impact later in the game.", "DMC3 improves upon just about everything it's two predecessors laid out, including it's legendary original. The crazy thing though about DMC3 is that it is a prequil, which may baffle some of those expecting it to be just as good as it's original.The variety of things that Dante can do should be the first selling point of this game. With easily at least 50+ moves at his disposal, many gamers will just be awestruck by the variety of things Dante can do in this run of DMC. The slight downside though is that you cannot perform them all at once, as Dante has to chose from 1 of 6 different styles that change the layout of his controls. This creates an interesting strategy for each player though as the game progresses, so it guarantees much replay value for those who want to try the game out in different ways each time.Another selling point for DMC3 is the increased arsenal at Dante's disposal. Dante has now more weapons than ever to play with, and all of them are much different from the traditional 'sword and guns' approach in DMC2. While I will not divuldge into details, these weapons heavily add onto the amount of variety and content in the game, and give the gamer a sheer feel of 'coolness' eminating from the arrogant red coated devil hunter.The music in DMC3 is stellar as usual. It is more heavy metal than the last two DMC's, but that is alright. The added in 'evil voice' that sings on all of the songs gives the game an added macho feel that is a definente need since DMC2 was rather quiet and generic despite it being a DMC game.Graphics are stellar as well, although there probably could have been some pre-rendered cut scenes.Overall DMC3 improves upon just about everything the first game had. It brings the strength back to the series that it lost with DMC2, and definently leaves the gamer wanting another DMC very soon.", "\"It's a large step up from the second Devil May Cry, but a far cry from the first one.  Most people have given the game nothing but praise, so I'll start out with the bad.Similar to #2, the gameplay is a bit stiff.  In the first one, it seemed like as long as your reflexes were good enough, you could dodge just about anything.  In this one, once you start attacking, you pretty much commit yourself to being entirely unable to dodge for a length of time.They were trying to push the \"\"difficult\"\" aspect of this game, and I can't deny that it's a hard game.  It's not the good kind of difficult though, its the kind that takes advantage of the games own weaknesses.  You're constantly fighting the camera, while most enemy's AI routine consists of \"\"get off camera, and repeatedly do ranged attacks or long-distance melee charge\"\".  That's right, off-camera, not behind you, to the side of you, etc.  Just where the camera won't let you see them.  This gets frustrating, especially since sometimes it takes you multiple seconds to recover from those kinds of attacks.  The enemies when alone are fairly easy, it's just the swarm tactics and trying to constantly dodge things you can't see before they happen (since the controls are sticky, you actually do have to know you're going to dodge a second ahead of time so you can get out of a combo).And finally, I know they were trying to portray a more immature Dante, but he gets annoying, fast.  The acting in the game has a few suprisingly well-done parts, but is substandard for the most part.Now, the Good.The game isn't all bad.  It's still got a lot of action, some badass moments, and a cool arsenal of weaponry.  The style system is so-so.  I like the additional moves plenty, but I hate the strategy aspect of having to pick one and stick with it until the next level or god of time statue (same thing with weapons).If anything, the game is addictive.  I've put about 30 hours into  (grinding my teeth the whole time).  I wish I would have waited till the price went down a little to buy, but the game is good at making the hours fly by once you're willing to accept its flaws.If they ever make a DMC4, I hope they realize what made the game great.  Faster, more responsive control, and enemies that were fun and challenging to fight, even in small groups.\"", "\"First off a caveat, I am not finished with DMC3.  I am on level 7, about 8 hours into the game.  If I change my opinion or have to add information I will do that when I've finished the game.  I just want to pass on my experience with this game for those on the fence about it.This is to PS2 what Ninja Gaiden is to Xbox.  And I don't mean that they are both kick ass action games and are the kings of the genre (which they are, by the way).  But they are both two of the hardest games I've played on either in a long time.  And not hard in \"\"the controls are wonky\"\" kind of way.  If you aren't the top of your game, you will die.  All the time.  And even when you think you are the top of your game, DMC3 will remind you that you are definitely not and you will die.And yet, through all of this, you will be having fun.  Capcom has managed to wipe the slate clean with the abysmal failure that was DMC2.  This game follows the gameplay of the first DMC, that is small rooms with lots of creatures, gothic architecture and insane monsters who keep coming.  DMC3 takes these conventions and kicks it into high gear.  The biggest and by far the most welcome change is that you go into a mission being able to select two long range and two short range weapons (from those you have acquired) and your attack style.In the mission you just hit L2 and R2 to switch between your two guns and 2 melee weapons.  What this means is that 1) there's no more going into your inventory just to switch your weapons and 2) since it's so fluid your combos become amazing.  Imagine throwing an enemy up in the air with your sword, juggling him with your hand guns, switching to your shot gun to blast him, switching to your three headed nunchucks to finish him up, then jumping on his prone body and use him as a skate board and sliding around the level blasting the other creatures.  You can and will do this if you want a high combo rating (and more red orbs of experience).The four beginning styles are an awesome addition too.  The beginning four are Trickster (evasion), Gunslinger (shooting), Sword Master (swords) and Guard Royale (defensive, counter attacks).  I am currently using Trickster and I think that's probably a great beginning start for this game because with a push of the circle button you zoom out of harms way, you can run up walls, run across walls, and (at higher levels) zoom while jumping.  I haven't use the other styles yet, but Trickster is very helpful in a sticky situation, which you will be in a lot.My problem with the game is not the high difficulty level.  It's the fact that there isn't a check point in any of the levels I've been through.  Unless you have a yellow orb, if you die you will start back at the beginning of the level.  This can be frustrating for some.  Take for instance, the level I'm currently at Level 7.  Not only is it a long level but towards the end you are fighting creatures that summon more creatures so you have to kill them before any others, then the boss from the second level shows up only he's not a boss (even though he has the same amount of life).  After you finish off these hard encounters you have to fight the real boss.  And if you die you're doing it over again.  For some this will be a major turn off.My recommendation is to save during the level if you find the fights turning sour.  This way, when you do die you will save all of the red orbs and items you've collected during the level.  For me, dying isn't THAT big of a deal then because you aren't losing any of the xp progress you've made.The graphics are great, the sound is a nice heavy metalish sound.  Sometimes the voices can't be heard over the music so it's a good idea to have subtitles on.  It supports Pro Logic II for the game and 5.1 for the cutscenes.As it stands, I think this game and Ninja Gaiden are the pillars of action excellence.  They definitely aren't for everyone and those who don't want a hard game should definitely look elsewhere.  But for those who are tough enough to stick it out, this game is excellent bar none on the PS2.  It's fun, moves fast and will blow you away.\"", "DMC3 is by far one of the best games I've ever played.  And one of the hardest.  Don't listen to people who tell you to give up.  If you do you'll be missing out on alot.  Dante may spout some lame lines here and there (he's young in this so it's excusable) but the storyline overall is one of the best ever written.  It was like playing a movie instead of a game and I became to wrapped up in the story to the point where no matter how diffcult it became I had to move on to find out what will happen next.  I'm not kidding, the plot and character developement is better than you'll find in most movies.**tips for those still having trouble**There is a cheat code that unlocks everything including different Dante outfits.  Find that code (at any cheat site) and after you enter it pick the Dante outfit with the purplish smokey arua around him.  If you play with that one you will have unlimited Devil Trigger which will help you out a lot.  I don't think I would have made it without it.  Also when I nearly completed the game I went back and replayed mission 2.  It's somewhat changed since last time I played including a Boss fight added in (The Scythe wielding Raven thing) and more demons to kill.  It was really fun and it allowed me to stock up on more orbs faster especially since it adds Rank and Boss points.  That allowed me to purchase extra life and even holy water for the final two missions.Remember, don't listen to the quitters!  It's a great game!", "Just like the title says, the game is a little bit fun but boring after a while. The cut scenes and character movements are gorgeous but it gets boring after awhile. If you don't have the walkthrough, this game is really difficult to beat. Character optimization page is a little bit confusing too.", "Capcom is working on a Special Edition version of this game, where it will have a new character to play as, and extra bonus stages."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.001193272415548563, 0.059641942381858826, 0.0687532126903534, 0.04892358556389809, 0.003690616460517049, 0.09218811243772507, 0.10313528031110764, 0.07455621659755707, 0.10581794381141663, 0.021147049963474274, 0.0015734523767605424, 0.093655526638031, 0.04054265469312668, 0.0022162660025060177, 0.07688482850790024, 0.08835999667644501, 0.0023925870191305876, 0.04301512613892555, 0.01052218209952116, 0.061790138483047485]]}
