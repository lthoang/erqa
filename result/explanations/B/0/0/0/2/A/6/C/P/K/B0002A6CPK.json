It's all pure cel-shading and Sin City style black and white.  Like a western comic or graphic novel.  The sound is haunting and blends perfectly with the eerie feeling of the atmosphere.  The seven Smiths are all unique and free of game cliches.  There's knife mastering albino, a magnum toting guy in a black suit, a blind man with duala fully-automatic pistols, a masachist girl with a powerful handgun, a masked wrestler with dual grenade-launcher handguns, a South American thief, and the man in the white suit with the silenced handgun.  All the characters are fun to use and everyone will be able to find a favorite.  Note that the game IS graphic and isn't for the kiddies.  Wether or not a parent would buy it for their child is what they think of the child's maturity and ability to understand and handle these things.  The story is rich with interesting plot twists and a great political feel.  The thinkers will love this game.  The \"\"kill-everything-that-moves-without-any-thought\"\" gamers will hate it.  The rail system may seem to limit freedom, but it is easy to get used to it with a bit of playing.  The true artistic minds and innovation lovers will adore this.  Casual gamers may find it a bit unplayable.  Still this is a wonderful game.  As the tittle says, one word describes this game: Brilliance.\"", "\"\"\"Killer 7\"\" is the hardest game to review.  Gamers may appreciate the unusual gameplay mechanics, while frown that it's not much of a \"\"game\"\".  People looking for a complex and well-written script and plot might be as totally involved in this story as I was, while even the most die-hard analyst will be frustrated by this bizarre and demented tale.  Moralists will surely scream at how profane, disturbing, and cruel-spirited this game is, while the more observant will hopefully gain some insight into the nature of the mentally and emotionally damaged.I don't believe I can accurately describe how this game functions, nor can I really narrow down whether people will like this game or not.  I have never seen such a huge split among gamers as to whether a game is any good or not.So, because I think it's best to leave that to other writers, who've published excellent reviews, I'm gonna throw in some cheap advertising.Those who've completed the game and want to enhance their experience about this original work of art should check out this website \"\"[...]\"\"  This analysis of \"\"Killer 7\"\" is nothing like you've ever seen.  This man has answered every question I can think of about this game.  Check it out!\"", "\"The Good: Deep story of politics and the paranormal, great voice acting, graphical style, game play is like no otherThe Bad: The \"\"on rails\"\" movement may turn a lot of people off, the story can get kind of confusing if you don't know anything about politicsI was very doubtful about this game and just passed it up until now. Once you dig into Killer7 you're swimming through a plot of deep politics and a weird paranormal setting. You are seven of the Smiths who are hired assassins for the government...or so it seems.The gameplay is very different from what you're used to. You press A and the game is \"\"on rails\"\". You choose which way you want to go by hold the analog stick in a direction and selecting the destination with A. This makes things a lot easier and lets the gamers concentrate on the puzzle solving and story. Use you the characters to solve the puzzles such as Kaede slitting her wrists to spray blood everywhere and call Harman Smith's ex wife to blast open invisible barricades...yeah I know WTF?! You can use Coyote to jump up high places and Mask De Smith to blast open cracked walls.Some of the puzzles involve getting a certain amount of objects, deciphering messages etc. You kill the Smiles by hitting weak points on them and there are dozens of variants. You have to hold down R and then scan with L and shoot their weak points. The voice acting is top notch and the graphics have a great cell shaded style to them. It's really hard to explain this game unless you play it. The game sports unique boss fights and is a perfect length of 12-14 hours. If you're bored with you're Wii check out Killer7 and you won't regret it.\"", "This is a totally original game that spits in the face of conventional modern games. It is a twisted tale with stylized visuals.  I'd play this game 100 times in a row and still like it. This is perfect if you are burnt out on the usual overpriced unimaginative trash developers have been feeding us lately.  No more heroes is decent but this is the real Suda 51 deal.", "\"I can't remember when was the last time I played a game as unique as Killer 7(other then Shenmue)but I will tell you, this game proves to be the perfect example of \"\"a hate it or love it\"\" game, and it proves that Capcome does try to do different things then make rehashed sequals like most game companies(GTA, HALO, Ratchet ect)and just proves(I'm too lazy to explain it or type it out)that video games have gone VERY mainstream.  Killer 7(as the previous reviewer said)is like an ART house game.  First off let me get this right off the bat.....the gameplay is not \"\"terrible\"\" or does not \"\"Suck\"\" as most game mags and sites seem to say it(Gamepro can kiss my..)just because they acctually played a game that is \"\"different\"\" doesn't mean it \"\"sucks\"\".  90% of the people who gave this game an average or below average score(not fans, Game sites/mags)were probably expecting fast paced action with lots of drugs/sex and everything GTA had!!!...Well it isn't, to anyone who is thinking about getting this game...if you're use to things like killing, killing and running around and more killing(like HALO2) DO NOT NOT EVEN TOUCH THIS GAME..Cause this game will make you use your brain(unless you use a stradigy guide)...Do you remember some of those annoying yet very rewarding puzzles in the original Resident Evil games?....EXPECT SOME OF THOSE, yes this game is pretty linear(obviously it was set that way)but the puzzles make up for that...And they really do make you think but you'll eventually figure it out and for people who don't like backtracking, THIS GAME ISN'T FOR YOU.Let me be the first to say(or 4th)that the gameplay is very, very unique and cool(especially the heaven smiles, I don't know were capcom came up with a name like that, but I think it's brilliant).  Especially the Rail track like gameplay, which is pretty cool but the best part about this game is the puzzle solving and the awesome First person shooting aspects(which I can't stop saying they pulled it off so well)were you have to scan areas to find the Heaven Smiles(those things are so disturbing).Visually the game is very beautiful and some of the areas you're in just make you awe in amazement especially the cutscenes..they are just...beautiful, did I mention the character modeling is just fantastic?  The way Capcom pulled off the Cell shaded/anime like characters just look great.  And my lord the sound in this game is very disturbing(especially when you hear the Heavens Smile laughs)and those Robotic-like jibberish you get from the 3 helpers that guide through out the game.  Some of the music in this game is also very cool, it sometimes has that \"\"anime\"\" feeling to it.  As far as the storyline goes, one of the previous Reviewer tells it out very well so there is no point on me repeating what it's about.Now let me tell you this....if you thought Manhunt was a very disturbing game, you haven't played KILLER 7, this whole game is just one dark, bloody masterpiece.  From beginning to end you have this \"\"tention\"\" that the game brings to you that just gives you the creep, especially some of the stories you hear, like early on in the game you find a head in a dryer that tells you some pretty disturbing things but that's not it, you still have people like Travis(another person who guides you in the game)and another person that tells you some disturbing stories.Now most games(like GTA)now I for one for the first time in a long time have to say this games theme is so dark and disturbing little kids shouldn't even play this...The game truly deserves it's M rating for Stylized Violence with limbs and heads being blown off in very anime/stylish like ways, Strong Language and just listening to some of those stories makes this game deserve its 17 and over rating!!!  This game isn't for little kids....Now lets get to itThe Good-Very unique and original-Very cool gameplay-First Person shooting aspects are just awesome-Very disturbing and brilliantly original creatures-Some of those \"\"Resident Evil\"\" like puzzles-The violence in this game(sorry if I sould like some 13 year old who thinks Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the greatest game ever)is very cool and sylish, I really liked the way Capcom did it, especially when you get a one hit kill-The way you upgrade your characters by using blood from the creatures you killed, and turning it into serum is just very cool(I've been using that word alot in this review)-Gamecube version runs much smoother with slightly better visuals and sound(plus I feel as if I have to say this but it just seems like a Gamecube game..)-The storyline(though at times is confusing and needs some thinking)is pretty cool and involves some POLITICAL THEMES(acctually \"\"some\"\" is the worst way to describe it!!!)-Using different Personas to solve some puzzles are very cool-Spanning 2 discs, expect to spend more then 10 hours on this gameThe Bad-WHY CAPCOM!  WHY!!!  This game would have made an amazing Gamecube exclusive and another reason why you should own a GC!!-The backtracking does get annoying at times...-It gets a bit annoying when you die and have to resurect your your personas-You either hate it or love it(I donno why I'm posting it on here)Overall Killer 7 was a very big surprise of 05.  It's very unique, original and just darn disturbing and creepy(this game ain't for the lil' ones).  Though the story may need some putting together(even though you could just read the back of the games cover to know about it, but there is just MORE to it)it's very original.  The gameplay is solid(no it doesn't suck)and the cell shaded/anime like visuals fit so well with the game.....did I mention the puzzles have some sort of \"\"Resident Evil 1 2 and 3\"\" feeling to it?...Overall I really liked this game it was one of the most unique games I've ever played since the original shenmue..I give this game a4.4 out of 5\"", "As other reviewers have mentioned, playing Killer 7 isn't really like playing your average video game. There are puzzles to solve, but they're spelled out for you. There are areas to explore, but you can only move on a set path. There's a storyline to follow, but you might turn blue before you figure out what it all means. There are seven characters, but actually eight, though most of the time you only play as six. If it weren't for the game's first-person shooter mechanics (which again defy the norm by giving you unlimited ammo), you'd be hard-pressed to call this a video game at all.Killer 7 is an experience. Sometimes bizzare, other times violent, always a tad frustrating. The distinct blend of cel-shaded graphics and anime-styled cutscenes is consistently impressive. Strong voice-acting gives life to all sorts of memorable characters, and the enemies come in all shapes, sizes, and colours. The controls, if very simplified, respond well and work to the game's advantage. Ever get tired of checking every door in an area to find the one that actually leads somewhere? Killer 7 only leads you to the areas you need to visit. Combine this with your character's fixed running speed, and Killer 7 controls your pace. You can't finish this title any faster than it allows you to. It's a fully controlled experience.Where Killer 7 will likely frustrate many gamers is not the simplified controls; if you're old enough to play this title, you've probably played older games like Myst on which Killer 7 draws influence. It's the constant enemy respawning that bogs things down, because they come back after you leave a room. Most have to be killed over and over again as they're directly in your path. Should you die, the process of recovering your character's head is slow and tedious. And eventually the constant character switching, to solve puzzles and kill specific enemies, grows old.Despite these gameplay flaws Killer 7 still manages to suck you into its world. It's a completely fresh experience that's never really been attempted before. There's a lot of profanity, violence and sexual elements going on here, but they serve the experience instead of pandering to the masses. This isnt a game little kids buy to show off to their friends, and even most of the target demographic will probably feel confused. But please give Killer 7 a shot, it's one of the strongest Gamecube/PS2 titles ever created.", "This game is wear... but its really interesting, like a bizarre movie, good history", "\"Games have been described as art in the past.  A game that comes immediately to mind is Ico, which oozed personality and landscapes that were both etheral and were just like a painting.  Not until this game have I ever played a game that was almost like interactive art.As far as I can see, if there was ever a game that was pretending to be an art house film, Killer 7 would be it.  From the stylized, psuedo-noir/comic book/anime inspired graphics to the dark, brooding, and sex-laden story and the weird gameplay, you have the makings of an art house video game, as strange as that sounds.  But does it work?  In a word, mostly.Going back to the art comment, each level in this game and each presentation of idea screams art.  It's like passing surreal paintings in a museum.  You pass one and go \"\"whoa, that's weird.\"\"  And you might pass another one that makes you want to tilt your head so you can maybe understand it better.  And yet, you come up with a hint but nothing concrete.  This game is like that, except that each level, each character each piece of dialogue is connected in a way a wall full of paintings usually isn't.Normally, when a game puts style and story over gameplay, bad juju occurs.  For instance, Xenosaga II was a great movie, but as a game it was horrible.  In this case, I've known from the beginning that the gameplay would be as equally weird as the storyline.  Suda 51, the game's creator, had been asked when Killer 7 was first introduced via some strange cut scenes how it would play.  His answer was he didn't know.  They had spent so much time and effort getting the feel and story of the game down, that they had no clue how it would ultimately play like.Truthfully, I shouldn't like this game.  And yet, somehow I do.  So, how does it play?  In a move that is a throw back to some of the early Sega CD games I played, you push the A button to move forward.  If you want to turn around, you push B to do a 180.  When you get to a specific junction that allows you do something other than move (i.e. an object or different hallways or rooms), you tilt the controller in the direction you want to go and push A.  When you hear the satanic laughter of the Heaven's Smiles, you pull the R trigger and enter a FPS mode when you aim and shoot at the approaching time bombs.  Hitting them in a yellow weak area is an instant kill that gives you the most blood.Yes, blood.  In fact, an interesting strategy system for leveling up involves collecting blood from fallen enemies.  As you kill enemies, you collect blood which can be used to level up each of your personalities in areas of power, aim control, speed, criticals etc.  So, you want to hit the yellow areas for an instant kill and for the most blood.Basically, that's the gameplay in a nutshell. You move around incredibly linear levels, on a rail, set path and blast any and all enemies you find.  Along the way, you'll come across various puzzles that require you to use your brain and sometimes a lot of luck to figure out.  Since this is a Capcom game, expect some Resident Evil (the earlier ones, not the new one) type puzzles.The game can be difficult in places both for your brain and for your trigger finger.  There are some enemies, the giant Heaven Smiles for one, who are difficult to kill.  Other enemies have to be shot in specific places or its exploding time.  Remembering the various enemy types and how to confront them adds an exciting and sometimes difficult strategy to the game.  When one of the personalities die, their head is left at the scene.  You then have to play as Garcian Smith to collect the head to bring it back to life.  This makes the game pretty \"\"easy\"\" in that it's hard to truly have a game over.  However, this adds to the backtracking/repetitiveness as you have to watch a cutscene of your character's head, then you're back in Harman's Room, you choose Garcian, run back to the body, another cutscene, then you're back at Harman's room again to choose your personality and then you're free to go play again.Honestly, though, the gameplay is just there to differentiate this from being a movie.  The best part is the incredibly bizarre and truly disturbing story.  In a (dis?)Utopian society where the world has reached peace and missles are shot off into the sky at each other in a sort of celebration that missles are no longer shot at each other, a new terrorist organization has taken hold.  The Heaven's Smile has members who seem perfectly normal until they explode.  Only the group Killer 7 can truly see them for the evil they are and annihilate them.What is the Killer 7?  They are the personalities of a Mr. Harman Smith, a wheelchair bound guy who seems to enjoy rough sex.  Each of the 7 personalities have their own strengths, weaknesses and special abilities that make them absolutely invaluable to the missions.  For instance, Kaede (the sole female) slits her wrists and baths barracades in blood in order to destroy them.  Mask De Smith performs wrestling moves on plywood blocking a door.  Kevin Smith can become invisible and invincible.  Coyote Smith can jump to high areas and open any lock.  Did I mention Kaede who slits her wrists?If the last paragraph didn't clue you in, this is a rated M game.  Which means it was created for those over 17.  Unlike games like Conker (a game I love by the way) that use their M rating for South Park style humor, Killer 7 has many disturbing moments.  Running into talking heads in dryers and other assorted places is just the beginning.  As the game progresses, you will see and hear many weird things, from the nurse/sex slave? Samantha and her sexcapades with Harman to a blinded kid to the head that tells of its former, death filled life involving the cutting off of certain body parts to a rainstorm of blood.  And then there's the cursing, the countless uses of the F word and various other four letter words.  This is not a game for children.There are some genuine problems with the game, however.  Yet again, Nintendo hasn't supported those of us who have High Def, a wide screen or surround sound.  The game isn't presented in HD or in Wide Screen format.  It isn't even Dobly Pro Logic II like some Nintendo games released.  And it shows.  If you have a receiver, it will be odd hearing sounds coming out of far spaced left and right speakers.  The quality of the sound isn't too great.  The voice acting is genuinely good, but sometimes it's set at a tone that is much quieter than the music.  Add to the fact that there aren't any subtitle options (except the scene specific ones where the characters speak in semi-gibberish) and you have a problem; especially since it's such a story heavy game.  Speaking of dialogue, another sore spot is the fact that some of the characters constantly repeat things.  There are three main characters you see in every mission, a red dressed thing (can't remember it's name), Travis and the information seller.  Each time you talk to them, they start off with the same dialogue.  For instance, the red dressed thing always says \"\"Master.  We're in Trouble.  Big Trouble.\"\" or \"\"Master.  We're in a tight spot.  A very tight spot.  I don't want to say what type of tight spot.\"\"  Dialogue like that.  The first few times, it's okay but when you're done with the 15 hour game you will really wish you could hit A or something to skip through some of the dialogue.  As is, you can hit start and skip ALL of the dialogue but since puzzle pieces, story and boss strategies are given, it's not recommended.There are only 3 options in the Options menu, rumble, invert aiming and stereo/mono (do people even play games in Mono any more??).  The problem is, everytime I continue the game, I have to change the invert aiming for some reason.  Mighty annoying.Overall, I'm having a hard time explaining this game.  I hope I gave enough to give readers an idea of what to expect if they decide to rent/purchase this unique game.  It's hard to qualify it as anything but an artistic expression.  One does not play art usually.  One views it, tries to gather some meaning from it, and moves on either changed or unchanged.  This game is like that.  It's very difficult (impossible?) to fully explain in any lucid way what this is.  Besides what I've written above, my best recommendation is to play it.  You can't get a feeling for it without trying it.  This isn't Halo nor Final Fantasy where I can say it's this or it's that.  This is something completely and utterly different, comprehensible and yet totally the opposite.This is a game that will go down as a love it or hate it experiment.  If the mainstream video game audience even hear about the game, I will be surprised.  The Electronics Boutique I got mine from only ordered two copies, both preordered.  And, those who actually do play it will either love it for the chances it takes, or will hate it for having the stiff gameplay.  I happen to love it and I can't tell you exactly why.  The story is interesting and very post-modern which is partly why I like it.  And, for some reason, the gameplay that is so stiff is also an addictive situation.  Either way you look at it, though, Kudos to Capcom for taking the chance and creating this dark masterpiece and experiment.  In an environment filled with sequels and movie to game licenses, I have to applaud Capcom for releasing such a different, yet enthralling piece of art.  Yes, art.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.16708314418792725, 0.19573460519313812, 0.010963495820760727, 0.10243141651153564, 0.1273995190858841, 0.0045478930696845055, 0.16750620305538177, 0.2243337780237198]]}
