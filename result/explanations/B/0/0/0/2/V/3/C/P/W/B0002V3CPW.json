What made COD so great is also found here in this game.You have very intense action, great graphics and sound, and pretty good missions. The action was so intense at times that it almost wasn't fun because you couldn't really enjoy the scenery.I see some reviews talking about how they don't like it because it is scripted. News flash: Every game is scripted. Only the games that are coming out now (though not released yet) like Half Life 2 and Medal of Honor Pacific Assault are not gonna be scripted. As for all other like RTCW, MOHAA, and Doom 3, they are scripted. So don't let that deter you because this games action never stops.My only real complaint is that the SP is too short. You have 13 missions, but no mission last much more than maybe 30 minutes. You have maybe 6 hours of game time here not including the reloading you will have to do when you die. And this game is hard. That is probably why most don't like it. It is hard on every setting.As for MP, it is a little better now. The aiming of the gun for SMG's still sucks, but the maps are better designed and a lot better to play. Some of the new weapons are cool too. They also have a sprint key you can use now to run quickly for a few seconds until you are \"\"rested\"\". The new modes aren't anything great, but are still fun. If they would have just fix the aiming, this would be even better.Overall, this expansion pack rocks. If you haven't gotten the origianl COD yet, wait unitl they put both COD and this expansion together and buy it. It will be worth the money. If you have COD, get this expansion. You will only be dissappointed in how short the games is.\"", "If you loved Call of Duty you're likely to enjoy the expansion pack, maybe even love it. It's more of the same and in this case that's a good thing, after all some game sites declared the original Call of Duty `Game of the Year'. There are, however, a few distractions that drop the expansion pack a level or two below its famous parent.Spawning enemies. At many locations in the game the Nazi enemies will continue to pour from the hills or buildings or wherever without end, ceaselessly and remorselessly as if there were a Nazi producing assembly line. A dirty little secret of the game is that sometimes you're supposed to advance on an enemy position and sometimes you aren't. It's pre-scripted. The designers deal with an unscripted advance by ripping your character to shreds with gunfire. At some point you'll find yourself trying to judge whether or not an enemy position spawns enemies or not in order to figure out whether to advance. If it's a spawning enemy position you'll need to advance or else run completely out of ammo. Non-spawning means you have to take out the enemies before advancing. Judging whether or not the enemy is spawning definitely breaks the illusion of the game. It's also tiresome and cheap.One of my least favorite scenarios in the original Call of Duty was the ones where you protect your position against an overwhelming advancing force. United Offensive is full of these and some are HARD. Anyone playing the original Call of Duty should remember the bridge scenario where you had to defend against endless advancing soldiers coming from all directions. It was my LEAST favorite scenario. The expansion pack features a pile of new ones. It does help somewhat that the game includes more save spots.The beginning and ending were duds particularly the ending where you protect a generic train station and then the game suddenly ends. Still, it's Call of Duty and it's a load of fun. There are some fun sniper scenarios and some great house to house assaults and lots of Nazi's. The good definitely outweigh the bad if you can get past some mind numbingly difficult section. The game was actually longer than I expected and could have passed for a full game.", "\"First of all, I want to say that I was not that impressed by the original Call of Duty. Sure, the gameplay and interface was solid, the Russian campaign was a nice escape from the norm, but overall, Call of Duty just didn't do anything revolutionary in the FPS genre. Just about everything in COD was done before by games like Medal of Honor and Battlefield 1942. Admittedly, COD did some of those things better.As for this new expansion pack, it really is not that good. For one, the original COD could be beaten in about 10 hours. Not a very long game, by any current standards. And it's safe to say that expansion packs often (if not always) offer less gameplay time. So how did they remedy this? Easy. They cranked up the difficulty by having scripted bombs kill you if you stand in the wrong place for too long, or the wrong place at the wrong time. And worst of all, I literally saw Nazis SPAWN in front of me due some invisible spawn point. I kill one wave of Nazis and then \"\"Poof!\"\" Hitler magically warped some Nazi stormtroopers onto the battlefield, or something. Shortly after this feeble attempt to defend the chateau, I died.I also want to point out that the COD games are trying to emphasis the fact that \"\"You are part of a Team\"\", like when you follow SGT Moody around. But the AI for my teammates is INSANE! My fellow soldiers walk right by Nazis and don't even realize what they've done! As a result, \"\"I\"\", me, personally, have to kill these Nazis that they've conveniently overlooked. Very very rarely has a fellow soldier taken out a Nazi troop for me when I'm reloading.I tried to be patient with this game, but in the end I just couldn't deal with it. Maybe I could put up with the game, if it had some redeeming replay value (I didn't buy it for multiplayer, only singleplayer). But this game has little or none. You won't find secret areas, you won't find secret maps, you won't find secret weapons, and, let's face it, any of those elements would be a little out of place in a trying-to-be-historical WWII game anyway. This isn't Doom or Half-Life.It's much worse.If you like linear games, then you'll love this.If you like more freedom, you'll probably hate it.\"", "I agree with everybody about the multiplayer in the game. It is simply awesome! First of all the original C of D multiplayer was simply awesome and in this game it's even better here's why:Now you can drive tanks or be the machine gunner on top just like BF1942 but driving and shooting is a lot more fun! The tanks have more fire power than BF1942 and you can shot quicker it seems?There is now deployable machine guns in this game. I have found they are great if you can find a good place with a view to set up and mowe down anyone going by but just running around on the maps and looking for people to shot can be inefective to say the least because if you do spot someone they have the advantage because they can just aim and shot you but you have to right-click to set up the gun then load in most cases and then left-click to fire so by the time you do all this your dead from a Thompson gun carring soldier.You can also shoot anti-tank weapons like a American Bazooka or the German's copy of the weapon. Which leaves tanks very vulnarable for destruction. You can also fire canons at tanks, buildings and soldiers which is fun. In all reality this is BF1942 all over again but 10X better. You can drive Jeeps to. The only thing you can't drive in the game is Airplanes but this is a ground combat game and besides BF1942 can have thier planes because even if you got one off the ground you couldn't hit anything due to going to fast or stay in the air very long without crashing into something because the controls were to hard!As mentioned by a previous reviewer, flame throwers were added and if you want to find one you will most likely have to kill the guy who is carring one. I did on the Berlin map. So make note of that.All and all, this game is awesome. Single player is in my persective is a lot harder unlike what another reviewer said. He must be some ex-millitary guy or something because I found it very challenging especially the first battle in the game. I am currently on the second mission and have no ammo in the middle of a fire fight and that's not good! Yes, single player is th e same thing as the original but why change something that's already great? Just add some new weapons and different maps and battles and go with it. I think people expect to much out of games especially expansion packs. If the orginal game was a success then the expansion must be ten times better..............wrong! You guys need to live in reality. There is nothing wrong with this game at all except it being short but it's a expansion pack! Not a entire game! Come on guys get real!Anyway, enough venting I just get tired of people wanting the moon and stars to boot out of games. Oviously they never seen the pregression of game through the years and how far they have come since the day of pong?One last line in responce to Joel's review. Joel, I had the same problem with my single player in fact I couldn't even get the game installed on my PC because of a missing game file so I returned the game to EB and got a new one and it works like a charm now! I don't know if that's what you will have to do but make sure you install the (1.4) patch for the game or it won't run at all which is the latest patch version out right now.Here I come Star Wars Battlefront! I heard this game was great!See you on the UO battlefield! Latter....", "Call of Duty: United Offensive Expansion Pack is as good as the first Call of Duty. Theres new weapons in it like the flamethrower and smoke granades. If you liked the first Call of Duty you should buy this. The first mission as a British soldier is really good. You have to defend a bomber while it goes on a bombing run. You can even walk around the bomber. It is a little harder than the first one.", "\"This is a decent game, much in the spirit of the original. However - not unlike the original - the game is not always fair, and it is not well balanced. It seems that some of the earlier missions are relatively tough compared to some of the missions middle.What bugs me about this game is that you can not win it by skill. The game allows you to save anywhere (which is good) and you will have to, because too often it depends on luck whether you will survive the next 10 seconds, or not.While playing this expansion, I have died 25 times or more at the same spot without having the faintest clue why (while other levels I played through without getting killed even once). I have died because I could not get the elevator controls to work. I have died because a fallen comrad's rifle fell on top of the \"\"Panzerfaust\"\" I needed, so I could not pick it up anymore. I have died because I wasn't able to interrupt the \"\"putting down the MG\"\" animation that takes 10 seconds. I have died because my comrads blocked the way. I have died because my character insisted on reloading all 5 bullets while the enemy solder held his gun 3 inches from my head. I have died being bombed by aircraft while hiding under a train. I have been sniped with a single bullet while running from cover to cover with almost no exposure to the enemy far to often for it to be realistic. I have also died for a lot of reasons real solders die, but that just aren't fun in a game.I like that I can save anywhere, but I do not like that I never know whether it is safe to save. Will I get killed in the next fraction of a second? Often there is no way to tell. I more than once saved myself into a position that made me die as soon as I reloaded. Does it have to be that way? Of course not! It would be easy to implement a rotating quick-save system. Create 2 or 3 quick save files and always only overwrite the oldest one. This way, if I save myself into a pickle, I can go to the slightly older save game. Or perhaps the developers could have given me half a second of inmortality right after re-load, so I could at least manage to hit the \"\"prone\"\" key before the bullet hits my head.Overall, this is not a bad game. There are lots of memorable moments and the game has high production values. If it was a bit fairer and really rewarded skill and not luck, this could have been a 5-star game easily. But as it stands, this is an impressive game that just is not a lot of fun. Looking back, finishing the game seems to be more like a dreaded task then entertainment. I guess that means it re-creates war better than most first person shooters...\"", "The Good: Amazing cinematic atmosphere, holds of graphically even today, immersive sound effects, realistic feeling gun playThe Bad: Visually look pretty dated in spots, no one playing online, a tad shortAnother World War II game, but wait this came out 7 years ago during the subgenre's peak. Why should I play this? It's just another Call of Duty. Before you go making drastic decisions Call of Duty started out as a WWII series way before the Modern Warfare explosion. Call of Duty was known for great cinematic atmosphere, tight gun play, and excellent story telling. United Offensive is the expansion to the award-winning debut game in the series. Offensive is just superb and even hold up on all levels today.The game has three campaigns that run between America, England, and Russia. You play as three different faceless soldiers, but the environment is the main character here. Each campaign has an amazing opening scene as well as some memorable moments like the escape on a Jeep in the American campaign, the gripping plane scene in the England campaign, and the tank scenes in the Russian campaign. There is never a dull moment in Offensive and everything from sound, great voice acting, and realistic sounding war effects bring together a riveting experience that I truly have not found in any other WWII game (even in later CoD games).Instead of trying to pack every scenario into one game (including weapons) we get some long battles that feel challenging, but not terribly hard. Some scenes can last up to 20 minutes (like the plane scene in the British campaign), but it holds you out just enough to make you feel the terror of war and a little helpless. Some battles require waiting a certain amount of time before reinforcements arrive and then a wonderful orchestral soundtrack picks up and makes it that much more intense.The gun play is solid and feels great with favorite weapons like the MP40, M1 Garand, MP44, and the Springfield sniper rifle. We've used the weapons dozens of times but each weapon feels different which includes power, accuracy, and mechanics of the gun. I feel the grenades still have no weight, but there are a variety of them. Each level and scenario feels different and gripping, but you never get attached to any characters because the environment is the main attraction.Mutliplayer would keep you coming back, but due to the age there is no one playing online ever so you have to stick to LAN. War games just aren't like they used to be, and United Offensive shows how to put across the feeling of war as well as realistic feeling weapons. United Offensive stands up graphically as well thanks to tiny details. The only thing dated are the low poly models, low resolution textures up close, and some static lighting. Most of the time you won't notice because you're sucked into the experience too much. If a game from 2004 can suck you in after playing modern war games then that really shows how much a games stands up.", "There is something to be said of the immersion factor when it comes to these types of games. The earlier call of duty games, as well as the medal of honor games, really nailed the atmosphere and aesthetics. That look and feel just isn't there in the newer CoD and MoH games. I can't put a finger on what it is exactly that makes the older games funner to play, but I find this to be the case for me.This is a good expansion pack to the original call of duty. The missions are a lot of fun, but the overall content is short. Graphics are definitely below par by today's standards, but it doesn't really matter... it's still a lot of fun to play!", "All reviews before 9/16/2004 are worthless!1ST of all, I don't know who these people are that post reviews before the game is even released but they should be completely ignored!!! Ego maniacs and know nothings wanting to prove they could do a review first I guess.Basically, this is the same game you have come to love - COD but with new missions. Nothing is really mind blowing or must have about this expansion pack.I bought this game on the 9/17/2004 at COMPUSA, installed it at 11PM on the 18th and within 4 hours on the 19th, I have finished the expansion pack.I really feel ripped off. $30 down the tubes almost.The missions are almost the same as before, infantry, blowing things up, driving a tank but some of the new battles are VERY fierce and challenging. You also get to play as a bomber gunner. There are some new weapons but nothing amazing. The flame thrower is cool but you really never get enough ammo or get the chance to use it under the right circumstances -  like flushing out a bunker!!The AI is the same. The graphics are the same. The mood/atmosphere is the same.The missions are still VERY scripted. Your men will not move forward until you do, they get in the way and will not move and block your shots still! The tanks won't go forward until you take heavy machine guns out...even though the tanks should provide infantry with firepower!!!Is this worth playing? YES. Is it worth $30.....barely.I would have paid $50 if they had made it longer and more in depth. Why not? The engine is already developed, the bulk of the work is done, now all you have to do is build the levels. I mean...I was done in 4 hours, on the Veteran difficulty setting!!! If I had to choose between spending my money on DOOM 3 or this, I would choose COD:UO. DOOM 3 is scary and edgy...and that is all. After the first level or so, scary gets old and you start looking for a good gameplay. COD:UO might be short but atleast it was thrilling."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12408062815666199, 0.10473469644784927, 0.10080987960100174, 0.016308609396219254, 0.1588069349527359, 0.3006545305252075, 0.004563772585242987, 0.1373528093099594, 0.05268815532326698]]}
