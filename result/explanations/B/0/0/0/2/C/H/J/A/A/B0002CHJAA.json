Great storyline, great graphics, great sound, simply Namco did it again!. If you beated the first one don't erase the saved games and get this one, you'll like it a lot. But on the contrary if you haven't played the first then avoid it, because you'll be lost in the storyline.", "I know I don't have much room to review the game since it's not released yet. Strange that some others think they can review an entire 40-hour experience based on trailers and opinions. Even stranger that it should be a bad game because, excuse me, the models are less colorful and look feminine? Please, people. Anywho, I was a little upset myself to find that they had changed the overall look of the game. But you know what? What attracted me was the story, which is why I loved the long cinematics. It was a bold move and very successful.So I'm very hyped for the sequel because the story expands, and there are as much as 5 more games on the way after this one(though I hear that Xenogears was actually episode 5; it says so in the credits)!", "\"The Xenosaga series is truly the most amazing and enthralling RPG that I have ever played.  The size and scope of the story being told here is nothing short of epic.  The game play is very good, with a fine balance between solving puzzles, fighting, and cinematics.You can complete this game in less amount of time than the previous game.  However, the battles in this second installment in the series are much harder and much more strategic than in Episode I.  Even minor enemies possess high amounts of HP, and they can also inflict various status effects that must be properly dealt with if you want your battle party to survive.  The pace of the battles are faster though.  Because some of the battles must be completed within a certain time limit, there is an additional surge of adrenaline rush in trying to plan and execute your moves.  The concept of boosting your characters is carried over from the previous game.  However, in this one, there are some tricks involved in using boost.  Four of your characters have the ability to either \"\"air\"\" (send an opponent flying in the air) or \"\"down\"\" (knock the enemy down).  While the enemy is in such a state, more damage can be inflicted by the next battle character.  But, you would need to boost properly and at the right time in order to put this chain of events together.  Anyway, do not let that discourage you.  The battle system has been simplified.  Also, the character development system has also been greatly simplified.  You do not have the multitude of weapons and armor options here that you had in Episode I.  The types of attacks at your disposal have been narrowed down.  In other words, the learning curve will be less steep.  It seems like the game developers might have wanted to attract a broader range of RPG players to the game.  This may be for the good; however, there are some of us who really enjoy the ability to customize our characters to our specifications.The Mechs play a vital role in this episode.  You must use your mechs (or Gears, for those who have played Xenogears) for certain battles.  The design of the mechs themselves are quite interesting.  It seems that the artists might have taken quite a bit of liberty with their artwork.  Throughout the game, you will have three at your disposal.A new playable character has been added to the main party.  You might recall seeing Jin Uzuki during the ending credits to episode I.  Here, he joins the party for reasons of his own.The cinemas and scenes in the game have really gravitated more towards \"\"serious\"\" and \"\"powerful\"\".  Yes, there were plenty of powerful and emotional scenes in episode I.  However, here you have a couple of scenes that were just downright heartbreaking.  Definitely, this is a game for a more mature and intelligent crowd.  Our friend Allen is not quite as funny in this one.  You do have plenty of lighthearted moments, however, that soon gives way to the very serious themes that dominate the plot.The sidequests are optional, however, the best features of the game can only be experienced by engaging in them.  The much talked-about Cooperative Attacks (where two characters work together to put a very devastating chain of attacks) can only be earned through the sidequests.  I suspect that you can easily lose 50+ hours in this game, if you engage in a few of those optional sidequests.  I also suspect that there are excellent side stories and adventures to go along with these adventures.  I chose to pursue a couple of them and found them to be worthwhile and entertaining.  Some of these adventures can only be played after you have beaten the game once and saved.  You can then reload your save data and pursue a variety of side stories and quests.A lot of the questions from episode I are answered here for you.  However, most of these answers come towards the end.  All I can say is be prepared for one grand story to unfold.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in RPGs.  Particularly, for those who have an interest in watching a great story unfold.  You will appreciate the story more if you play Episode I first, however, there is a DVD out there with some of the more important and pivotal scenes from episode I.  If you are short on time, perhaps you can locate one of these DVDs and spend a few hours watching them, prior to playing episode II.  Is Xenosaga II: Beyond Good and Evil as good a game as Xenosaga I: Will to Power?  That is a hard question to answer.  That would really have to depend on what you look for in an RPG.  However, let me state that both games are great.  My only wish is that someday, this story will be released in the form of a novel.  The story is just too good.\"", "The original Xenosaga was a massive epic set in the universe of Xenogears (though not directly related.) The anime art style was innovative, and fun, and the story well thought out, deep, and engaging. Early on it was made clear that Xenosaga was meant to be a trilogy, so naturally Episode II was inevitable, and I was looking very forward to the new entry as many plot threads were left untied at the end of the original.This installment disappoints in a number of ways. First, the art style has gone from being an anime, to being an attempt at more realism, which isn't easy to pull off on PS2. I normally do prefer realism, but I loved the art style of the original here, and felt that there was no need to change it. Many of the game play mechanics were confusing, I never got a double attack going, it seemed overly complex compared to the original. The game suffered from severe frame rate drops frequently, and worst of all the story was convoluted, and about half way into the game completely looses track of its own plot, either that or it feels that way because rather than focusing on the story and primary quest the game drowns the player in too many nonsense side quests, many of them taking far too long, and many of them having a hook that they cannot be completed until playing through the game a 2nd time. Namco really made me mad because I normally like to get absolutely everything in an RPG, but this game you have to literally play through the game 20 times just to complete one of the side quests, and frankly, I have too many other games to play, I'm sure that other people would feel the same way.On the plus side, there were a handful of interesting revelations in the story. I am eager to see the third game, but I certainly hope that Namco shifts its focus back to the story and the main quest. Side quests are good, but there should only be a small handful of them. The average player will spend about 25 hours out of the 40 it takes to complete this game (as complete as possible for 1 time through) on side quests and that's just far too many.", "...... I'm going to assume the reader has played episode 1, if you haven't this might not explain much. For those of you who have ....This is a nice sequel. It picks up right where the last one left off. The new look is great, though I didn't mind the old anime look either. The cutscenes are beautiful and usually action packed. However all's not well. They changed the battle system. It took me a lil while to figure just how it works. Gone are the flashy tech moves that made the battles awesome. {I hate that} Tech moves won't catch your eye at all this time around. The battles are harder and much more strategic, but duller. There is however a nice selection of ether and support skills that you can learn to build the charcters the way you see fit. The story thus far makes sense and explains alot of things you might {or might not} care to know. The only other promblem is that the cutscenes take so long. You can pay attention for only so long before your mind wanders. The first had this promblem so I'm not surprised. They don't have an ecyclopedia this time around ..... on episode 1 that thing was vital to understanding the story {at least for me} Fans will love it. Just thought I'd warn you and soften the blow of the new battle system.", "Well, here we are, the second game in the Xenosaga series.  If you've played the first then you were surely intrigued enough to pick up this game.  Is it just as good as it's predecessor?  Let's find out!Graphics (score 9/10): If you just finished the first game and then popped this one in, the first thing that you would notice is that the art style is different.  It's not that it's bad or anything, but coming right after the first game, the difference is jarring.  The first game looked a lot more anime in style with characters having the big eyes and whatnot, but this entry goes for a more realistic look.  As I said, it's not bad, just a jarring change.Music (score 9/10): The music is just as beautiful as it was in the first game.  Absolutely stunning tracks that lend great emotional depth to the scenes they are featured in.  As for voice acting, all of it's good - well, with one exception: Momo's voice is really irritating.  It's just high pitched and annoying.  This is unfortunate, given what you'll find out later...Characters (score 10/10): The same cast of characters from the first game make a reappearance here (Shion, KOS-MOS, Jr. Ziggy, Momo, chaos).  They are just as compelling as they were the first time, and they get a lot of great development too.  Our favorite scary villain Albedo also returns to haunt our nightmares.  I like that in this entry, you get a lot of back story on him which really helps flesh out his motivations as a character.Story (score 10/10): Don't even bother trying to pick up and play this game if you haven't played the first one.  Suffice it to say, the story is very confusing if you haven't played the first game.  It's even more complex than the first game's storyline, and features many disturbing and heart-wrenching scenes (perhaps even more than the first game).  This game definitely focuses on Jr. and Albedo's backstory moreso than anything else, and I'm not unhappy with that as it's very interesting.  If you're new to this series (you really shouldn't start with this one) just know that the story features space, artificial lifeforms, aliens, higher-dimensional planes of existence, and Nietzschean philosophy.  That's really all you need to know, huh?Battle System (score 6/10): Well, combat's where everything kind of goes downhill.  Battles are really irritating due to the break system.  It seems like it takes ages to break an enemy, making battles really tedious.  You're also now forced to bring Momo if you want a reasonable chance of success.  She's about the only one who has a weapon that can damage certain enemies reliably so you're pretty much forced to bring her.  If that weren't enough, she's also the only person who can heal the party when they are in E.S. battles - another reason you're forced to bring her.  Remember earlier in the review when I said her voice was really annoying?  Yeah, isn't it lovely that the one character you need to bring has the most annoying voice?  So, basically, character balance is not fantastic in this regard.  Couple that with extremely tedious battles where you've got to break every single enemy to do any decent damage, and you've got a big dent in the enjoyability of this game.  In fact, out of all three games in the series, this entry has the least enjoyable battle system for me.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, menus, camera angles, all the standard stuff is fine.  One thing of note here is that there are no random battles.  Yep, everything is totally wandering around on-screen waiting to kill you!  So, people who hate random battles will be very pleased.  On the other hand, the cutscenes in this game are just as long as unrelenting as the first game's.  If you're one of those gamers who hate long cutscenes, this whole series is not for you!  I, however, didn't mind at all.  There is one thing left I should mention - this series continues the same button layout as the first game.  The O button selects things and the X button cancels.  It's backwards to most other PS2 games, and it can take some getting used to.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  The battle system of this game makes it feel very tedious at times, but the story, characters, and music are still fantastic.  Plus, you really need to play this one to get to the third game in the series, so I'd still recommend it despite it's flaws.", "\"In all honestly, how could a game series take this big of a step backward? I mean even the best or most average of game series' take a while and a few bad sequels to degrade to such a point (example Mega Man X5~X7). How could one even work on the development team with a straight consciousnesses knowing you were developing and planned to release such a inferior product? These are the questions about Xenosaga II that keep me up at night...But seriously (no I don't say up at odd hours of the night pondering about what Xenosaga II could have, should have been), for as great as the original was and the amount of hype this game received, Xenosaga II is a perfect example of a 'almost' complete bust.First off, the game is way to short. I was really surprised I was on disc 2 after 7 hours of gameplay. I'm not quite sure, but does Xenosaga II use dual layer DVD's like the first Xenosaga, cause if it does and that's all they put on the first disc, that's pretty sad. It's almost seems they put it on two normal DVD's instead of a dual layer disc just to give the player the illusion that because it's two discs it must be a  long game. Nice marketing tactic guys, gamers aren't as dumb as you think...Xenosaga II's battle system is absolutely horrendous; it's up there with Legend of Dragoon's battle system in my book (I love to bash that game to no end). Expect to die a few times and spend a few hours taking a severe beating (especially if your battle party is surrounded by enemies ~ that's the definition of fun!) until you get the hang of it. Add to the fact the longer you take to enter a command, the more likely the enemy is going to boost and slap you around in the next turn. To add to this atrocity, add the fun of constantly stocking and boosting attacks in conjunction with airing and downing a opponent to cause any kind of reasonable damage. Then add to that fact not all characters can damage airborne opponents. Combat in Xenosaga I may have been a little basic and simplistic, but at least it was easy to pickup and learn, you almost need a degree (or a really good guide) to get anywhere in Xenoaga II. Oh, and don't get me started on the Mech or E.S. combat. While character combat is confusing to no end, E.S. combat is so pathetically simple it makes the gear combat in Xenogears look good in comparison.As for side quests, add another point to the lame column. 35 sub quests helping complete strangers out of their stupid, insignificant daily problems they won't remember a week from now while the fate of the universe swings in the balance of your quest's success. Yeah sure, that sounds like fun as well. If I don't like to help complete strangers within the real world with their problems, what makes game developers think I want to do it in a video game? Come on!Graphically, Xenosaga II is pretty much the same as the original, which makes me wonder why they hyped up that part of the game so much? Do they think gamers are so fixated on that lone aspect of a game, they are willing to forgive flaws in execution and gameplay? I mean, you can take the most graphically gorgeous game, and if the gameplay stinks, the game as whole suffers. Xenosaga II, as a game, proves this theory without a doubt.As for sound or music, you actually better off turning the volume off, unless you're viewing a cut scene. Most of the music is pretty bad (a slim few interesting tracks do exist), and the voice acting is decent, outside battle that is. In battle, the voices make you cringe, where talking \"\"Star Ocean: The 2nd Story\"\" sound bite territory here. MOMO has to be the worst, the first time you hear her say \"\"I'll lend support\"\" you just want reach though the TV screen, or hope she reaches puberty before the series is over.On the plus side (yes, their is a plus side ~ surprisingly) Xenosaga II's story continues on the rich tale from the first game, even if it seems a little touch and go, and they seem to focus too long on certain characters (the first disc is basically Jr. and MOMO centered); the second disc plays like \"\"hey, we forgot about the core of the story, let's go find the Zohar\"\".The bottom line, if you like the story, you should play Xenosaga II, despite all it shortcomings. Actually, I'd recommend renting the game instead of buying it, it's short enough, and it'll teach the developers a very meaningful lesson. If this game becomes a greatest hit, like the original, I'd be very suprised (but it probably will just because I said that).\"", "The reviews given by Amazon authors Joe Juba and Matt Miller are spot-on.  Xenosaga Episode II is very short for an RPG.  And yes, the gameplay has been altered in a negative way.  However, any fan of Xenosaga is obligated to play this game.  Episode II contains exciting and emotional cut scenes, offers further development of the main characters and continues a deep yet interesting storyline.  Just be prepared for a few inferior modifications.I, too, was disappointed with the change in voice actors, but I saw it coming and therefore wasn't overly bothered by it.  Not everyone sounds different; I only noticed Shion and KOS-MOS with different voices.  Thankfully, the characters' mannerisms and speech patterns have been left intact.  To me, that's what's important.Another noteworthy downgrade is the music.  Episode I had a full symphony orchestra (with chorus) for it's soundtrack!  Not so with Episode II.  The music isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing that makes me want to buy the soundtrack CD, unlike the first game.  The sound effects are pretty much unchanged.If you want to collect everything the game has to offer you must take on the optional sub-missions, called GS (Good Samaritan) Campaigns.  There are 36 of them, some of which are quite lengthy.  The time spent on these sub-missions is equal to, if not longer, than the main quest!  There's also Segment Files to discover, which Xenosaga veterans are familiar with.  They should have named this game's title Side-Questsaga.Also, can anyone tell me why Episode II comprises two disks?  Episode I is only ONE disk, yet it has more cut scenes and is twice as long!  I suppose Episode III will comprise THREE disks and only be 1/3 as long as the first game..!  It's puzzling...Oh, and why no database in this Xenosaga?  Episode I had a useful database of facts the player could access any time to keep track of all the terms, items and significant events in the game.  It was stupid to drop that feature.  There IS a brief recap of the events from Episode I available to read, but it doesn't make up for a missing database.The one, single improvement over the first game is the removal of the mail/plug-in module system.  I found it annoying trying not to miss any of the items and information offered by the mail system attachments.  I was glad to see it go in Episode II.Despite all the negatives, Xenosaga Episode II is still worth playing, at least for fans of Episode I.  Let's just hope for a grander epic in Episode III.  There's plenty to improve at this point.", "It used to be one of those adages that the second novel was always worse than the first.  This is no longer true, possibly because great first novels have become rarer.  But games, on the other hand, generally get better with each sequel.  Or that was the way it was before 2005.  I wasn't particularily happy with Suikoden IV, but it is Xenosaga 2 that is the current holder of my 'disappointment' award.  For which I will no doubt get blasted.Imagine that your production staff spent so much on improved character graphics that when the smoke cleared, there was only time to put together a core story with about 20 hours of play.  What would you do to inflate the story?  How about a set of 50+ mini-quests that send the player shuttling back and forth across known space.  How about a couple of record length cut scenes?  Throw in a battle system so complicated it takes hours to figure it out.  And to add insult to injury, make everyone move very slowly.  And there you have Xenosaga 2.  A game that really could have been great, drilled into the ground because of the wrong priorities.There's nothing really wrong with the story arc that a couple of additional 'missions' wouldn't have solved.  Instead some relatively trivial bonus dungeons are your reward for finishing the game.  Most of the side quest time is spent traveling, not solving or fighting.  They would have been more enjoyable if the player didn't have to keep flying back and forth between New Militia and the Foundation.  The battle system, which was complicated before now has too many intricacies to count.  Yet once you level up enough, brute force is just as effective as finesse.I have to concede that the character graphics are amazing.  Facial expressions are perfect and the effects are often lifelike.  But the overall graphic level is still pretty much the same as Xeno 1.  I like what they did, but I would happily have sacrificed the new, sexy Shion for more hours of play time.  Even the thrill of having the entire team play in bathing suits wears thin after a while.Hopefully this is just a one game slump.  The producers leave no question that there will be a Xenosaga 3, and I hope they put more emphasis on the story and less on Shion's designer outfit (well, MOMO and KOS-MOS look good, but Shion is always a bit frumpy).  At least this game has filled out the character roster and explained some of the mysteries of Zeno 1.  Hopefully, things will get better again.", "\"The first xenosaga game's budget was at like 100%, and they cranked out a heck of a good game.  However, when it came to the second xenosaga game, (this one), it's like they only got a 25% budget, and they cranked out a ..... well.... a piece of crap game.  From the way the characters look, to the way they sound, it's pretty corny.  The level designs and music totally sucks, and the battle system will leave you saying, \"\"W-T-F!?\"\"  I'm currently playing the 3rd xenosaga game, and it seems like they got a 90% budget, and so far, at 5 hours + into the game, it feels the same way as it did when I played the first xenosaga game.... pretty good.  So it seems like they cranked out a good product with the third xenosaga game, and i'm having a good time playing through it so far. Lets just hope it stays that way. As for this one... forget about it.  Definately play the first one, forget about the second one, (just watch the cut scenes from the game on the internet somewhere so that you can keep track of what the story is all about), and definately play the third one.  I didn't finish this game.  I just took it back to the store and got my money back.  It's just not a good play.  At least not to me.\"", "I just finished this game last night, and I'm still blown away.  I should have expected it, but still, the ending shocked me, and I couldn't help but nearly cry at the heavily religious themed ending.  This wasn't the only time I was filled with emotion in this game.  Scenes with the 'villain' gave me simpathy for a character who seemed to deserve none in the first game, and were often very heavy in nature.  Shion is forced to make a choice which breaks her hearts and an emotional player's as well.  This whole game is infused with emotional depth and philosophical ideas in a way no other video game can compare to, and will never fail to amaze the player at the power Xenosaga has over their hearts.This amazing story is told through cut scenes with good graphics, some lasting at least 15 minutes.  I never found myself tired of the endless cut scenes because the improved character models look great, the story is enormous, and the action scenes are greatly done.For fans of the first game, gone are the four experience types, now you get three, and one of them you rarely get.  Skill points are used to learn abilities on the new skill tree.  All characters share the same skills, but each can put the skills to use differently.  Class points are earned easily, from bosses and from mastering parts of  the skill tree.  Exp is earned from fighting battles, as usual.  Some people say that the skill tree makes all characters nearly the same, but this is far from true.  some characters have stronger ether (magic) casting ability, some have ether based attacks, strong against a few types of enemies, but horribly weak against others, some have strong physical attacks, some can only hit ground enemies, and some can knock enemies into the air and then hit them hard.  Stocking allows you to build powerful combos to utilize the new break system.  In the break system, certain move sets will 'break' the enemy, after which they will recieve slightly more damage and can be knocked to the ground or into the air.  Using the improved boost function, which now goes with the entire party, as well as enemy party, you can have your other characters attack the enemies which are in the air and deal at least twice the normal damage.  Gone are the long, annoying, repetitive animations from the first game, battles now go almost twice as fast, causing the game to be about half as short as the first.  There is no money system in this game, although you can sell items for a side quest, so all items must be found or aquired from enemies, although eventually you will get spells which will make the items mostly unimportant, and the 'psycho pocket' skill will allow you to steal usefull items from enemies.  Sadly, gone are Yasunori Mitsuda's orchestrated themes, now Yuki Kajiura is in charge of the music, which seemed to me to be so 'Phantasy Star 2' (Sega Genisis), which isn't a bad thing, I just miss the orchestra.Anyway, I think I've summed up the differences well, so if you can get by those, you will hopefully enjoy the game.  By the end of this game, even more than in the first, you will feel that you are standing in the middle of two very powerful, ancient forces, and the series is reaching the point of being an epic.  If you haven't played the first yet, there's a lot going on in this game, it will be confusing to someone who hasn't played the first.  It's a greatest hits title, so you can pick it up without emptying your wallet.", "I bought this game because I thought it might be a good game to play. But I didn't get very far in playing it. I was really disappointed and felt that I had waisted my money. The game strategy is very complicated. I just couldn't understand and handle it.", "Xenosaga 2 looked like it would be a great game, I mean updated graphics, continuation of a good storyline, and probably one of the most noticable changes, Shion's makeover.  Unfortunately, this game falls a long way below the expectation I had.Where to begin, the first noticable change is the graphics system, which is a good thing.  It's easy to tell how the character is reacting or feeling.  Also, the more realistic environments add to the seriousness this game has.Anothing new change are the costumes, which work but are, in some cases, kind of creepy.  Shion now sports an outfit that shows a little more skin (it's not that I don't like scamply clad women, I do, it's just not the Shion I know), Momo gets a navy-like costume, Jr. gets something similar to the past game, and so on and so forth.The biggest change you notice though is the voice actors.  Shion, KOS-MOS, MOMO, and chaos each have different people doing the voices.  Shion, MOMO, and chaos don't bother me as much as KOS-MOS' because now she sounds almost human as opposed to the cybernetic voice in Episode 1.I figured that wouldn't bother me for long, but then I get into the game and find out that they messed up the battle system.  No longer do each character have their unique moves, but instead each character can learn the same moves depending on what they spend their points on.  The only good change to this is the Dual Techs which allows two characters to do a move on an enemy.  Physical attacks also suck in this game because you have no control as opposed to the ability to change them in Episode 1.So, we start off with new voice actors, an even worse battle system, and some really confusing battles.  The battles get confusing because now you have to Break the character to weaken it by using the right combinations of buttons, which is really annoying to do.So what are the redeeming factors you ask?  Well, we've got the storyline, the graphics, and the new costumes.  If that's all that you want, then great, pick it up, otherwise stay far, far away from this game.Pros:- Continuation of the epic saga- New costumes for the characters- More mature look- Dual TechsCons:- The change in voice actors- The battle system- The long loading times to get into battle- Taking away the unique abilities that each character could learn.- The side quests are more annoying this time around and more bountiful, but if you want more dual techs, you have to do them.", "\"Right?Pros:-Good graphics-Good story(Picking up where the 1st one's emotionally bizzare, but excellent story left off)-Pretty good way to get skills(class points to get class, and buy classes, and get skills, it's pretty easy)-Cinematics are fast paced and action packed-No more using bio sphears at save points.  Save points automaticly heal you, and bisphears are used at the menu to completley heal-While fighting you can carry on your boost you have left from the last fight, and carry it on to the next-This series continues in a ok wayCons:-I was under the imression that data from the first one, like HP, attacks and such could be continued on this but NOOOO!!!  They say here's some bonus stuff, good job, and uh, we just screwed you over-I miss a whole lot of stuff like--Buying and selling(This is one of the main pricipals of almost every RPG.  Taking this out just pissed me off.  No more buying cool upgrades, or selling crap like scrap iron(I have enough scrap iron in my game to make a friggin gun)--Voices(They ruined this.  Shion, Kos-Mos, Momo, Chaos, Mary, ect voices were replaced by worse ones.  If they were to replace Al Bhedo's voice, that really would have been horrible, but Kos-Mos' voice change just really ruined her more than anyone)--Models(I thought it would be nice to see them mature a bit, but now, I take it back.  I miss the good ol anime style look.  The worst changes were made to Kos-Mos(At first I thought she looked great, but the voice-acting shut me off like a computer), and Momo, she was so cute in the first one, but now she looks older, and sounds like an obnoxios little girl)--Battle System(Ah the nuber 1 thing I and so many are complaining about.  The first one was almost flawless, it had awsome cinamatics during battle, and had a 2 punch then just blast them the fudge away, or do level up the speed with skill points and kick the crap out of the ASAP.  Now this game just toatly abandoned all of that.  Stocking is a pain, but you have to do it, unless you want a looooooong battle.  But stocking also leaves you volnurable, leaving the enemies to stomp a new @$$-hole in you.  Theres no more big moves like Last Symphony, or X-Buster(Oh wait, the put that on a E.C., who cares?!  It's for Kos-Mos!!)  You can't have 3 E.C.s(or AWGS) on the screen, unlike the 1st one.  The only bigtime cinematic moves are doubles, but they suck, so I tend not to use them.  In the first one I hated the tedious cut-seenes in the first one because I anxious to get back to the battle system, but in this one I'm a wanna sit and watch a cut seene because of the battle system.  Episode 1's battle system was like a automatic, easy to use, and fun, but now it's like they changed it to a for-jorkin' Stick Shift.  It's hard to convert, altho I'm getting a little better with it, I just miss doing tech attacks from the first one.-2 discs!?  For what!?  The first disc of this was only 9 hours, and the second was only 12 hours.  The first one was 40 hours.  And 2 disc RPGs are longer than that(Ex. Star Ocean was 2 discs, and 70 hours of fun)My first review before I edited was based off what I saw when my friend played it, and my first hour of playing.  He let me play a few battles, and it was pretty cool, but when I found out the full story for myself, I understood what he ment by when he said, \"\"Don't buy it, just remember the story from when I played it\"\" I didn't wanna listen, because I thought we had our own opinions, and I thought my experience would be diffrent, but it our diffences were close to a simile. At first I thought I could use data from the 1st one one this game, so I leveled up everyone to the point where I could beat the final boss without even worrying, but now that I did all that for nothing, I'm just pissed to a high degree, and not only that alot of the changes weren't satisfactory.  Well, this game is just a sequal that experimented with the wrong things, like Devil May Cry 2, Sukoden IV, The World is not Enough, ect.  Too bad it didn't pull a Splinter Cell(PT), Metal Gear Solid 2, or Resident Evil 4).  Altho all of this is just messed up, this game still is playable, and those who want to keep up with the Xenosaga series should definitly get this.  But those who moderatley liked the first one or hated it, will be dissapointed, hate this, or not even pick it up.  Personaly, I think it wasn't worth the $50 price tag.peace\"", "\"Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille Zur Macht, was a breakthrough in gaming!  It had deep characterization, a deep storyline, innovative battle system and a soundtrack that blew you out of this world!  It was a plot driven game with an intoxicating storyline.  Episode II doesn't compare to the original in very many ways at all.  Things have been changed that shouldn't have been changed, and in all essence, it's more like watching a season 2 of a declining TV series.Xenosaga Episode II isn't a bad game.  It's actually really good!  It's just that it suffers from the sequel syndrome.  The first one hit a level that was so high, and now this one has to compare.  Either you'll be quite surprised by where it goes, or quite disappointed.The game opens up with a flashback of Chaos being sent to Miltia with a realian named Canaan to see why all the Realians have gone berserk.  Chaos and Canaan meet up with only one who still seems to be in control of himself.  General Jin Uzuki, and to prevent spoiling more, let's just the say we rejoin our main cast from the first game in mere moments.Where as Xenosaga Episode I put an emphasis on storyline, Episode II seems to put an emphasis on character development.  It does a fairly good job too.  You'll learn more about these characters, and be able to cope with them.  Unfortunately, if you haven't played the first game yet, it's all mysterious to you.A few things about the gameplay have changed.  The battle system is refined just a bit.  Now enemies are in \"\"zones\"\".  Either Zone A, B, or C.  Depending on the zone they're in they could take a lot of damage from your attacks.  You can also knock them in the air, or down on the ground.  You can also link attacks together to perform devastating combinations.  Characters attack using points.  If you decide to \"\"stock\"\" (by defending) you can attack more times in one turn.Xenosaga Episode II is not an easy game.  You can't just mash down on buttons and expect to win battles.  There does need to be strategy involved.  Without strategy, you'll more than likely lose.The character raising is different.  In the first game, you had Ether Points (Magic), Tech Points and skill points.  In this one you only have ether points to improve your magic skills.  Truthfully, that's sad since all your characters learn the same skills, and once you've learned everything (being that there are no Tech points and Skill points in this one) you'll have a bunch of Ether Points sitting around begging to be used, and they never will.The graphics in the game have been updated from the first one.  I personally didn't think this was neccessary.  They tried to make the characters look more \"\"human\"\" and I personally thought the anime look of the first game was just fine.  Some of their actions look a little strange, mostly because the dubbing of the game to English was terrible, but otherwise, the graphics are smooth and rich.  KOS-MOS looks the nicest out of all the characters.The voices, for whatever reason, have also changed.  I was not too fond of this.  The voices from the first game were perfect. These voices are either superb, or they're terrible.  MOMO for example, has a terrible voice actor, while Chaos has a fairly good one.The music is no where near as good as the first game.  Actually, to be truthful, the music in this game is forgettable, and you won't care too much for it in the end.  It's not the first one.There aren't as many cutscenes as the first Xenosaga, and while the story is intriguing, the cutscenes don't flow quite as well.  Also, it's sad to see this game isn't as long as the first one, and there aren't as many secrets.  I thought the game would have more secrets than what I got.It's also very disappointing with what you get from having a save file at the end of the first Xenosaga.  Just a bunch of skills and whatnot.  Nothing more.  No impact on the story or anything.  Really, the save file is useless.Xenosaga Episode II does work, but it's sad that it can't live up to the first game.  It had potential to live up considering how long it was in development, and what the first game gave it to go with.  I just wish it could've fallen through.If you loved the first Xenosaga game, pick this up.  You won't regret it, but you probably won't remember it as well as the first game either.\"", "Long loading times at the start of every battle.  A battle system that forces you to fight a certain way; a certain way that makes even the trivial random encounters take >5 minutes per battle.  A short main story arc with dozens of annoying side quests that will have you spend more time walking from point A to point B (namely between 2nd miltia and the Kukai Foundation) than you will doing everything else in the entire game.The story even seems to lag a bit in the beggining, but luckily the second half of the game or so seems to pick up the pace.  As The cutscenes and story are good, but seem lacking compared to the first one as well.  Albedo can only laugh maniacally for 5 minutes straight a couple of times before it gets old.Did I enjoy playing the game?  no.  Do I recomend it?  no.  But,...since I plan on playing the 3rd episode as well (which is supposed to be much better) I trudged my way through it.", "\"If you enjoyed the first Xenosaga and are as curious about the story and where it was headed as I was, then go out and buy this right now.The story in Xenosaga II answers a lot of the questsion and issues raised in the first Xenosaga involving Jr., Albedo and Gaignan. In fact, their story compromises the first 1/2 or so of the game. However, their story is immensely interesting and their conflict is very important to the current struggle. This makes the game very interesting as it raises new questions and digs a little deeper into some subtle religious moments. As an example and THIS IS A SPOILER: look at the color of Rubedo, Albedo and Negrido's hair and look up on the internet (try Wikipedia, I found the information there particularly useful) the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. You will find some very interesting connections. I would also recommend taking some character's names (Canaan, Nephilim, as an example) and do some searching.The game also continues the first's of using Friedrich Nietzche's works of philosphy to shape the current story (particularly his idea of not looking at things in the dichotomy of good and evil, black and white, heaven and hell, etc). Overall, the story in Episode II is at least as good if not better (I'm torn at the moment) than the first game. It is exciting, the cutscenes are well directed, and the plot moves quickly.Which brings me to the title of my review. While the plot is great and continues the Xenosaga tradition, the gameplay is worse than the original. The gameplay is made up for cutscenes and dungeons (with a very very seldom trip to Miltia or the Kukai foundation, and the ships). The dungeons are long and boring, filled with mind-numbing puzzles that involve pushing boxes, setting water levels, making sure bomb detonation flares stike at the same time, going down the right \"\"light path,\"\" etc etc. They have all been done before and frankly they are boring.The battles are equally long and boring. Each enemy has a hit zone that is connected to the buttons of the PS2 controller. You have to figure out which areas will \"\"break\"\" the opponent's defenses, then boost other characters right after to actually do substantial damage. While interesting on paper, the game takes it too far. When each battle becomes a game of stocking your character's moves, building up a boost bar, then unleashing combos on an enemy, it becomes boring and redundant. It's just used too much and often. Every battle became a struggle of this. I can see merit in having to do it with big important boss battles, but fighting the same white drone over and over and having to do the same zone hits just so I can hit him? Some normal battles took upwards of 10 minutes to complete. That is rare, granted, but these aren't boss battles I'm talking about.Another huge change is that every character learns the same skills. This is a double edged sword for me. On one hand, you're entire group can learn cure spells which eliminates the need to have a \"\"healer, fighter, mage\"\" combo all the time. However, it also means that all characters are alike. The only way they differ is by \"\"double\"\" attacks and their own regular attacks. As it is, the best strategy in the latter half of the game was to have all of the \"\"tank\"\" characters in a group because they could take damage while stocking their turns.Another interesting change was that there are no shops. You don't buy weapon upgrades and you don't buy healing items. The only items you get are dropped from creatures or found in the environment. Because there is no need to buy items, you hardly need to go to towns, and the game becomes a dungeon crawl, albeit one with an extraordinary story.Along with the greatness of the cutscenes and the boredom of the game play comes the music. The musical director of the first game is gone replaced by two directors: one for the cutscenes and one for the game play. The cutscene director has some really excellent songs and some forgetable songs. Overall not as good as the previous director, IMO. The gameplay director's music is horrible; it's jazzy, j-pop that is very very incongrous with what's happening the in the game. You don't want to be creeping around some huge evil base while elevator music is playing in the background...The Gear battles...er...AGWS battles...er....ES Battles are much better and more utilized in this game than the last. It more closely represents Xenogears. It's a welcome change. In fact, because you don't have to stock your turns just to do damage (though it is an option for doing some neat attacks), the ES battles play better than the on foot battles.Finally, the length. Apparently people took 40-60 hours beating Xenosaga I. I took 35 and mostly got everything I needed. It took me about 23-25 hours to beat Xenosaga II. I was shocked when at the 9 hour mark I was flipping to the second disk.Overall, this is a 4 star game. The cutscenes (presented in 5.1 if you have the ability to run it) are superbly directed and have a wonderful sound quality. The voice work is really well done (except for MOMO, I liked her voice from the first game), and they are usually filled with eye candy. The plot is excellent, with wonderful pacing, it makes you want to know what's going to happen next and see how it all ties together. It doesn't tie up all loose ends and the third Xenosaga will probably feature the same cast. The gameplay is a bore. I longed for the cutscenes. I really hope they 1) make the gameplay more fun or 2) make the series into an anime series (which they've done with the first episode) in the future. So, my rating is a 3 for the fun, but the story (5 star) pulls it up to an overall of a 4.If the original Xenosaga left you wanting so much more, then you should definitely buy this game (especially from a website that still offers the preorder bonus, a VERY awesome dvd that has 4.5 hours of cutscenes from the first game). If you're looking for fun gameplay, this game, unfortunately does not do it for me.Please know that for every bad quality I've mentioned in the game, I really really enjoyed it from a story view. My friends and I have spent a lot of time discussing it outside of playing because it really is a rich game. I really wanted to give it the 5 star review. Unfortunately, it's a game, not a movie and I have to review it as such.\"", "\"I just finished playing the second in game in the Xenosaga trilogy.  Someone described it to me as \"\"a little slow to get going\"\", which isn't an entirely bad way to describe it, though I was entertained even early on.The game is still a turn-based RPG where you run around on the map in real time until you run into an enemy.  However, the combat system has changed somewhat.  You're able to now move behind enemies, though more often they move behind you, and do greater damage against characters' backs.  The game also puts great emphasis on \"\"breaking\"\" opponents.  You have to hit a certain attack area in the right sequence, usually by boosting another character, to \"\"break\"\" the enemy's defense and cause increased damage.  Done properly, you can decimate enemies.  If you can't figure it out you can mostly just level grind up and manage pretty well, though you kind of need to have it down for some bosses.You will fight Albedo again.  Look up a guide.  If you don't, you'll be pretty likely to rage-quit the series.  Once you know the trick he's not too bad, but until then he's nearly impossible.  The same holds true for several other ones.  If something kicks your rear repeatedly, you're probably missing the trick.The skill system is needlessly complicated.  You have levels, classes, and skills.  If you pick too many lower classes and don't choose all skills within them, you can end up with no way to get the higher level skills.  A lot of the higher level ones are obtained from those doors you have to decode.  Overall, you can get by in most of the game with only the healing, memory (not strictly speaking necessary but tremendously useful), and Revert (revive).  I would have enjoyed things better had I not been too terrified to pick any other skills until after I'd started disc 2.I had quite a bit of fun with the game and finished it in about 25 hours (game time), probably 30+ real time.  Considering I paid less than the cost of a Big Mac meal for the game and I can even play some epilogue missions yet, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase.If this is irrelevant to you, then skip this last paragraph, but the female characters aren't as attractive as in the first game.  It's not a huge deal, but the short skirts are replaced by pants or shorts and KOSMOS isn't really showing any skin at all anymore.  Shion changes into capri pants and a low cut top a short ways into the game.  I missed her glasses.  Also, you won't play as any female character until well past the start of the game.  Again, ignore all this if you don't care.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.024602482095360756, 0.07953447848558426, 0.0013339115539565682, 0.0450342558324337, 0.019414348527789116, 0.04969106614589691, 0.073102205991745, 0.043911296874284744, 0.09331140667200089, 0.09346429258584976, 0.059478290379047394, 0.10330072045326233, 0.10208504647016525, 0.016655659303069115, 0.007025117985904217, 0.05727791413664818, 0.10447929054498672, 0.026298217475414276]]}
