There isn't a whole lot to write about jigsaw puzzles aside from quality of image and construction.The pieces are cut cleanly.  None of them were stuck together (i.e., not cut apart) in the box.  They fit together without any inordinate difficulty.  (No, you're not going to be using your fist to pound them into position.)The image quality is good.  The assembled puzzle presents a vertigo-inducing photo of blue collar workers at lunch on high steel.  Not somewhere you'd ever catch me!  Our daughters found it amazing to see them suspended high above the city in a pre-OSHA era, with no safety harnesses or other devices to keep them from falling.  Brave men.In all, a worthwhile puzzle with enough pieces to be challenging for a family for an afternoon.", "My father and my wife and obsessed with puzzles.  In fact, most of our family vacations consist of my mother and I trying desperately to peel my wife and father away from the living room table and their spread of intricate pieces so that we can actually do something with them.  So, against my better judgment, I decided to get this puzzle.  It just looked like a fun challenge for them.  I mean, it is basically one solid color (with lots of subtle variants) and so I knew it would keep them consumed.  Needless to say, they LOVE this, my father especially.  I love the photo.  It has such a crisp and nostalgic feel to it, and I love the vintage allure, but this is all about the challenge and it certainly poses a great one.  The quality here is impeccable.  The pieces are perfectly made, expertly cut and they make for a unified complete product.  They fit together with ease, no gaps or squeezes to be found.  In all honesty, I'm not sure I'd buy another brand now that I've seen how superior Ravensburger puzzles really are.", "This puzzle was a pleasant surprise for me. I knew it was going to be a challenge because it's all in black and white. However, it's a fun way for me to pass time by working on it a little at a time whenever my baby is taking a nap. I've been working on it on and off for two weeks and I have the easy parts done: the border, all of the men and what they are sitting on, and the rope. I've only just started an the sky and buildings, which are the parts that will require the most effort. The parts are very well made and this is a top notch quality puzzle.", "\"This puzzle is of the famous photo, \"\"Lunch Atop A Skyscraper, 1932\"\". The first time that I saw this photo, my hands were sweating because, there the men are sitting in an I beam. There are no visible safety apparatus to keep them from plummeting to their death. Perhaps because they used to it, they were casually lighting a cigarette or smoking or chatting with their neighbors.The pieces are extremely well made. I measured a piece; it was 1/16 inch thick.  Previous puzzles that I have were made by other companies and the pieces are half as tick. That extra thickness makes durability and a firmer lock between the pieces. In fact, when I turned some of the pieces that I had put together, it looked like it had not been cut. I love the blue backing on this puzzle because; it would much more difficult to separate the gray of the backing from the gray of the puzzle. The puzzle was the same size as the description indicated. I have had puzzles that turned out to be smaller or larger. That is annoying when it is larger because you have to move it to a larger surface.The pieces are precisely cut. Without that you have the problem of \"\"Is this supposed to be there or not\"\". There are a large variety of shapes. Nothing makes a puzzles boring than just having a few different puzzle shapes.Personally, I would rate the difficulty as a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 because of lack of color. The men on the I beam and the pulley ropes keep it from being a 10. I have never done it before I am tempted to glue this puzzle to a surface and hang it. I would not be tempted to put it together more than once because of the difficulty.This was my first Ravensburger puzzle even though I regularly do puzzles for fun. I am very impressed with the quality and want to buy them again but not in such a high difficulty level.\"", "We began building this puzzle on the end of our dining room table, but we don't have a lot of time to dedicate to the puzzle and we needed the table for other things, so we moved the puzzle to the floor in a corner of the guest bedroom - not the most comfortable place for extended puzzle building. Before starting this puzzle, I would recommend that you establish a dedicated space to build it, as it might take a while. It's a pretty large puzzle, so a standard card table probably won't work.As far as the puzzle itself, how much is there to say? Like all Ravensburger puzzle products, it is superior quality. The pieces are thick and durable. We have not had the problem mentioned by other reviewers with the blue backing coming off, but then, we haven't used a table cloth or anything similar. Also, the pieces fit snugly and properly together such that they interlock securely and you are never confused whether or not you've made a correct match. The snug fit was especially helpful when we were transferring the partially assembled puzzle.I find this puzzle to be just the right level of challenging. The gray scale coloring makes it difficult, but by no means impossible. The dark I-beam and the men sitting on it provide enough variation to assemble the center of the puzzle with little difficulty, and even the top and bottom portions have enough subtle variation that finding matching pieces is doable. I've been working on and off for about three months and am about 80% done with the puzzle. My husband pitches in occasionally and my daughters (ages 3 and 5) try their best and have found a couple pieces (especially when we were assembling the edge), but mostly it's been me working in rare, treasured bursts of relaxing time. My daughters are fascinated by the iconic, vertigo-inducing image of the men sitting on the I-beam with no support and they can't wait to see the fully-assembled version. They would like to seal and hang it up in their playroom when we've finished it, but I'm more the type to take it all apart again and reassemble it sometime later. We'll see who wins that battle.In any case, you can't go wrong with a Ravensburger puzzle, and this one is a nice challenge for advanced jigsaw puzzlers.", "Ravensburger is my favorite brand of puzzle.  The one thing in particular that I like is that you usually know when you've made a good fit.  Other puzzle brands often have a couple of maybe fits and I think this is a quality control issue.This particular puzzle is quite challenging because the majority of the puzzle looks about the same.  You have to really pay attention to subtlety or be persistent.  This is approximately a two-three day puzzle for the three people in my family that do them together.I like that this is an historically interesting puzzle that leads to a lot of pleasant conversation.  Usually, when we do puzzles, there are people from two or three generations participating, and I love the ones that allow this kind of conversation about how much society has changed in the last century.  It's an awesome photograph that I'm sure most readers are familiar with, and I enjoyed the renewed focus on it that only a 1000 piece puzzle requires.Well worth the money.", "\"If you loves doing puzzles, this is a great brand to buy.  Each time we have purchased one, we have loved the sturdiness of the pieces and that they were clean cut.  I am not a fan of opening a puzzle box to find thin flimsy pieces that are poorly cut.  Each piece fit wonderfully in its place without the  \"\"maybe it could go here\"\" kind of questions.  Also, the scene was a challenge while not being impossible.\"", "I haven't done a puzzle in ages! I loved this one! We had a great time putting it together as a family. I love the photo too. All the pieces were there.. easily snaps together. It took a few hours to put together, but we just rolled it up in a puzzle keeper mat when we weren't working on it. This would be great for a rainy weekend, or just to leave out on the coffee table when friends come over.", "This black & white puzzle brings a sense of nostalgia. A photograph of bygone days, the guys eating lunch, having a smoke a drink and unconcerned of their height over a beautiful old New York City landscape.It's a nice way to bridge generation gaps. Picture granparents and the little ones all working together among memories, chatter and innocent inquiries from the children.This is a well constructed puzzle and a little easier than those 5000 piece puzzles.The photograph is breathtaking and I think it'd be great to glue and keep on the wall as a decoration and an accomplishment for everyone who helped put the puzzle together.I really like it myself.", "Photographed in 1932 by Charles C. Ebbets, Lunch Atop a Skyscraper is recognized worldwide as a split second in history, captured on black and white film.  I've studied the photographic image, so when offeredLunchtime 1932, NYC 1000 Piece Puzzle, I quickly completed the request for this item.  Knowing I had a few days before it would arrive, I struggled to completeA Bar At The Folies-Berg&eacute;res, Manet Jigsaw Puzzle 1000pcwhich had been on my puzzle board.  After fitting together darkly vivid colors and paint strokes on a better than expected jigsaw puzzle, Lunchtime 1932 was a sweet relief.  First of all, Ravensburger puzzles are consistently my favorites because of their high quality, variety of shapes, security of fit, and general image representation.  It's been awhile since I've assembled a black and white photo puzzle, so the first thing I did was pull out the good Verilux natural spectrum floor lamp in order to really differentiate between the shades of gray.  Working from the men on a beam first, I then moved to the muted sky and downtown buildings.  At 1000 perfect pieces, this puzzle doesn't take forever to complete, but it's one of the most difficult I've done and takes longer than one with more discernible images.  I spent some time looking for a face only to see that I was holding a piece of a hand upside down.  If you're an impatient person, this may not be to your liking, but I enjoyed the concentration and ability to really use my negative space perception.  It's a great puzzle of a photographic image that will be a classic after another 80 years.", "It took 6 people 5 days to put this puzzle together. I usually do a couple of jigsaw puzzle a year so I am not unfamiliar with them but this Ravenburger is the most challenging puzzle I have put together.First of all the quality if like no other.  Very nicely cut strong pieces and easy to snap the pieces together.  The blue backing of the puzzle is very nice too.  As compared to other jigsaw puzzles, this one can be taken apart and put together again without any wear and tear to it.The puzzle was not worked on consistently but every time someone went past the puzzle, they just had to stop and try to get some pieces together.  This was a group effort and we had a lot of fun even though the puzzle was hard to put together, but we did it!  It was a cause for celebration after the last piece was fitted in!Would I purchase another Ravensburger puzzle?  Absolutely.  Great hours of fun, a good challenge for your mind and a nice family project.", "I LOVE Ravensburger puzzles -- pieces are thick and sturdy and the picture is often educational.This picture is that famous 1932 photo of men eating lunch on a skyscraper beam in New York City. My kids thought it was fake, so we enjoyed looking up the historical photos and information about the original photo. They were amazed!", "\"I hadn't done a jigsaw puzzle in years so this Ravensburger \"\"Lunchtime 1932\"\" puzzle was quite a pleasant surprise.  I chose it because I have always liked the photograph.The manufacturing quality is excellent, including the printing of the image, the paper, the beautiful blue paperboard backing, the crispness of the edges, even the sturdy box.  The pieces snap together in a very satisfying way.  There is no annoying paper dust in the corners of the box nor any raggedy edges.This puzzle is fairly difficult because it is black and white and the background is almost textural.  It took a while just to sort out the like pieces and put the edges and the foreground image of the men on the beam together, then the sky across the top, Central Park, and the buildings were noticeably more difficult.Each of the 1,000 pieces is different and some of the matches are fairly tricky with many deceptive near-matches.  The pieces are about 1\"\" x 1 1/4\"\" which is a nice size--any smaller and they would be hard to handle.  The finished puzzle is 27\"\" x 20\"\".The Ravensburger \"\"Lunchtime 1932\"\" would be a very nice gift for teenagers and adults but there are puzzles better suited for younger children.\"", "I have always been a fan of Ravensburger puzzles, and this new 1000 piece puzzle continues Ravensburger's trend as the leader in high quality high piece puzzle sets. This particular puzzle is extremely difficult to put together and I must say the difficulty lead to a very satisfying feeling upon completion. Since the puzzle is in black and white and the pieces are relatively small, I would definitely only recommend this puzzle to those with a great deal of patience who truly enjoy putting puzzles together. Overall though, very high quality and a great buy for puzzle enthusiasts of all ages.", "Both my uncle and my father were in the construction industry in NYC/Brooklyn in the 1930's-40's. When I saw this, I remembered the stories I used to hear about how they would dangle from beams on the skyscraper construction. This puzzle is unique that it is in black and white (which is a new, unique challenge for me) and at the same time educational/inspirational for people of all ages. To see how our ancestors had to build the skyscrapers that we all take for granted today, before all the safety precautions of today, is eye-opening. I love puzzles and try to complete one every month or two. I am hooked on black and white now as it brings a whole new dimension to trying to match and fit pieces. I highly recommend this for everyone.", "We have dozens of jigsaw puzzles in our house, and of all the brands, Ravensburger never disappoints. So I was happy to have a chance to review a Ravensburger for Vine, and talk them up!Compared to other brands, the cardboard is nice and heavy, the printing doesn't peel off as easily (we've taken them apart and put them back together, repeatedly) and each piece is slightly different, unlike cheap puzzles that only have 1 or 2 shapes for their pieces.  Even the box is sturdy and made for generations to pass on. All this quality comes at a reasonable price, and they come out with tons of puzzles, so if I see a Ravensburger selling for around $10, I jump on it.We've started to put this puzzle together, and it's quite challenging with the black-and-white photo, yet the buildings in the background offer more visual interest than a solid color.", "\"I was looking for a challenge for my 85 year old father. Yes, a challenge. He is the king of all jigsaw puzzles and amazing to watch. In his own words, Ravensburger is his \"\"brand of choice\"\". There is nothing worse than wasting your time on a puzzle when the pieces don't fit. Ravensburger pieces are quality with clear cut edges that fit tightly! He has even glued and framed several for family and friends!  He has thoroughly enjoyed building this puzzle and looks forward to the next one!\"", "This 1000 piece puzzle is a sure hit in my house. Black and white puzzles are more of a challenge to us than the colorful ones. Not to mention this one is all men in a row, with sky scrapers below them and they all look alike when you try putting it together! This one will take a while to complete. We love this puzzle and recommend this to challenge your brain!", "Ravensburger Puzzles are the cream of the crop in the puzzle industry.  The pieces are quality and the designs are worth framing when you finish putting them together.  I have several of these puzzles that I have glued together and framed to hang around the house.This is the one thing that everyone heads to when coming to visit.  I always have a puzzle going on my dining table and everyone will just take a gander then see what they can put together.  It's a great family project where you can spend some quality time together.Well worth the $$ for something that is made with pride and thought of with family values in mind."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.054759472608566284, 0.0430215522646904, 0.056242749094963074, 0.060668546706438065, 0.04488826543092728, 0.051895901560783386, 0.05549987778067589, 0.04753298684954643, 0.049374304711818695, 0.04105393961071968, 0.059935878962278366, 0.05575938895344734, 0.049050234258174896, 0.057349011301994324, 0.05602661892771721, 0.04901574179530144, 0.05550738796591759, 0.0563681460916996, 0.05604998767375946]]}
