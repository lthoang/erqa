First the connection strength got weaker, then the signal would go in and out. Finally, it would simply refuse to work.I thought it was just a faulty unit, so I bought another seeing as how they're cheap. Same series of events with the new one.Belkin is garbage. spend a few more dollars and get something infinitely better than this crap.", "I used this on a netbook on which my wireless broke. Using the USB port was perfect so I didn't have to trash the netbook. I think this only works on XP so you should check to make sure.", "This wireless Adapter works good but a little touchy to set up, you have to have it in the right place for it to pick up the signal, but is easily remedied if you keep adjusting until you get the right position", "\"When I brought it back to Walmart, the customer service person exclaimed \"\"Not another one of these!\"\"Yes it's a lemon.  It worked some times, but never very well.Good idea - bad product.  I'm going to try the Linksys version.UPDATE:  I got a linksys.  It works great.\"", "When I got this adapter it took me 3 hours to track down a driver that wouldn't just stop working in windows 7 from Atheros. The Belkin drivers just don't work. I used it for about it year and it would cause panics/stop errors all the time.Recently I checked the Belkin website and found a driver update for window 7 and guess what it doesn't work. I just chucked it in the trash at that point I wasn't going to deal with it any longer.Do not buy this.", "Just got this in a local store (would've gone through Amazon - much cheaper, but it was needed immediately.)Using a laptop with WinXP SP2 + all the patches, this thing works great.  My laptop has 3 USB ports (all of which are USB 1.1) - contrary to other reviews, this little USB plug DOES work in each USB port without any problems.  After you install the software and plug it into the initial USB port, Windows will automatically install the driver for each additional port - but it works flawlessly in each.I was going to get the PC card version (PCMCIA), but from the specs on the box, this one has twice the range.  I'll probably use this in my home computer after vacation since it's incredibly easy to setup and use, and have had no problems whatsoever.Would recommend to anyone looking for a USB wireless Network Adapter!", "I have 2 of them Thar JUNKI got 2 of them at the same time A 57 and a 300 thay both drop the signal and I have to reconnect all the time.

Of note, I don't use the bundled software and got the drivers from Belkin's website.The range is great.  I am using it in a trailer next to my house during a home remodel.  The signal is going through a stucco wall, a fence and metal trailer siding to get to my PC.  The reception is so good I was able to turn the power down on my wireless router.  In fact, I can pick up 5 to 6 neighbors networks.  Also, It has never dropped a connection.My connection speed varies between 24 and 54 Mbps.  I stream Netflix movies with no problem and downloads are plenty fast.  I will definitely consider Belkin again if I am in the market for a wireless adapter.", "I could not believe my old Macmini is NOW connected wirelessly.  I never thought about trying it on a Mac until I read the review (from MrKite123) for this product.  My Macmini is pre-Intel, no built-in Airport card and no Bluetooth.I went to Best Buy and nobody there can tell me any product that will work with Mac. (Ironically I bought this from Best Buy for around 60$ for my PC).  I even did some research on the internet and it is so frustratingly hard to find any information for a little wireless dongle for Macs.I used this for a couple of PC's before and it worked.  I even had a PC on the third floor while Fios router is at the basement.  Now that one of the PC was retired and the other one I decided to connect directly on the ethernet I got this dongle put on the shelf.  Thats when I got intrigued by the above mentioned review.  I could not tell if mine is version 3000 or 4000 so tried Ralink Drivers at first it did not work.  I then read the other comments and it led me to the link ftp://ftp.zyxeltech.de/ZyDAS/ZD1211_USB/Macintosh/.  I am thrilled that I can now connect to the internet and Itunes without having to bring the Macmini to Genius Bar to install Airport card for hundreds of dollars.", "This adapter works fine in my Vista PC, but it was a problem to install.  The directions packaged with it are wrong for Vista, but you only find this out by scouring the information on Belkin's web site (and it isn't easy to find there).  The real problem with it is that it seems to require more power than some USB ports provide.  For example, on my PC, a usb port in which a flash drive works just fine can't even see the Belkin adapter.  You need either a powered hub or a port that has plenty of juice flowing through it.  As many, many posts on the web note, the Belkin tech support is worse than useless.  I haven't even heard back from them on my report.  All that said, the product does work; I've had no drops or other problems.  In fact, I do run an older Belkin wireless adapter on a second PC (under XP), and the older one sometimes has a problem connecting to the router, whereas the new one under Vista seems to connect without a hitch.", "This works OK but I got disconnected from the internet a lot with this and it runs REALLY slow too. If someone else is using the same connection forget about being able to use the internet with it. Not as good as I thought it would be.", "I have this product and it will not work with the Vista on my new desktop.", "This USB network adapter was working as promised for only 6 months. ONLY 6 months. The Wi-Fi completely stopped working after that. Now I have a $20.00 paperweight that doesn't even work. The light keeps on blinking non-stop its so annoying that I had to throw it in the trash. I bought a Tp-link 300mbps USB wireless adapter and that one is alot faster, alot more sturdier and farther signal. The belkin one felt cheaply made and the signal was horrible. Got about 1 or 2 bars at the max. The Tp-link I get about 4-5 bars. A complete waste of money and time.
