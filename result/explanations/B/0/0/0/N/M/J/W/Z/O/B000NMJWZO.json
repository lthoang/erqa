It makes great pancakes, but isn't limited to just those. Everything we've made with this mix has been flavorful with a pleasant texture. A lot of gluten-free mixes and products have a grainy texture to them, but Pamela's products are light and fluffy.For those who have an issue with dairy in addition to gluten, there is some dried buttermilk powder in the mix, but it hasn't yet caused any issues for my wife or me and we've been using the mix for about 5 years now.", "I attended an Autism Fair on July 24, 2010 and had the pleasure of meeting people who are directly involved in the production of this product.  Pamela's Products are at the top of my list for all my baking needs.  For people with coeliac (a condition which precludes one from eating wheat/gluten products), leaky gut/irritable bowel syndrome as well as autism, Pamela's Prodcuts are a Godsend!This pancake mix is ideal and the pancakes are doggone delicious to boot!  The bags have wonderful recipe selections.  You will also want to check out Pamela's website for more good recipe ideas.Whether you have coeliac, autism or other wheat/gluten related issues, you will enjoy Pamela's foods.  Make her products your best friend as they are not only easy to cook/work with, the food is excellent.  Hats off to Pamela!", "The ingredients are mainly rice flour, buttermilk powder, baking powder and xantham gum so one could definitely mix their own but the price is decent compared to the price of just rice flour.I made the chocolate chip cookies and the cornbread from the recipes on the back of the pouch and both came out fine.", "\"I've always enjoyed using Pamela's baking products for my gluten-intolerant grandchildren. However, I won't get to try this one because it contains both dairy and tree nuts, which was not revealed in the item description, and to which our kids are also allergic. This is not an item that can be returned, but I donated my three bags to another family with celiac but no other allergies. Amazon should be more careful in listing all the allergens in its \"\"allergy free\"\" products.\"", "First, if you haven't used this product before, you are getting 12 pounds of flour.  The due date (time it should be used up) was about 2 and a half months from time I received it.  (So plan on using this product fairly often.)  Now, as to analysis, I don't have to eat wheat free, gluten free food, so my bias here is toward taste and nutrition.  As to taste, I tried it in my sourdough waffles that I make, substituting the flour for the usual wheat flour and leavening agents (my original recipe called for baking soda, salt, and baking powder--apparently all are in this product), and the waffles turned out just as good if not better than the wheat ones.  I also tried it in the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the package, and I like those cookies better than the original wheat one. The taste is slightly different (I'm sorry, I can't quite put my finger on the difference.)  The cookies tend to be a little more moist and slightly thicker. I plan on trying more of the recipes on the back (there are at least 6 recipes on the back of the package). Nutrition wise, it's a mixed bag; you can't directly compare wheat flour to this mix as the mix has a lot of our minor things like salt which taint the analysis.  Calorie wise, it looks like the mix has more calories (but not a large difference).  To sum up, I really like the product for taste.  If you HAVE to have a gluten free product, I think it is a great alternative.", "I have never been able to make a good pancake except for buckwheat. When I saw this as a lightening deal and read all the 5 star reviews I figured it was worth the try.OH MY GOODNESS~I just made the most wonderful fluffy light and thick pancakes. I have never and I mean never had such a good pancake. Being wheat free is a bonus. I don't have to be gluten free but I do tend to be a bit sensitive to too much wheat at times.I almost wanted to take a picture of these pancakes. I could not believe I made them. You have to give this a try. I will never want another pancake but these. They are much healthier too, I used the spray butter on them and sugar free syrup and even with those two things they are FANTASTIC.I will be on subscribe and save when my supply runs low. I cannot wait to make other things with it for the holidays.", "This is a great baking mix at a great price. For around $3 a pound, you will receive the most perfect gluten free baking mix that works with any recipe. This mix makes the most perfect pancakes ever. My family likes them better than regular pancakes (they can't even tall the difference). This mix makes great scones, muffins, biscuits, crusts, cookies, etc. I store my mix in an airtight container and the other two bags in the freezer until I use them. They seem to go really quickly around here. With this mix, it is so much easier to be that perfect baker you have always wanted to be without all the hassle. My mom also needs to eat GF and she used to make her own baking mix from scratch. Her mix not only took more time to make, but it was actually more costly than this mix. After she tried Pamela's mix, she stopped making her own and switched over.", "\"This mix makes pancakes that are so good, my Fiance who does not have a wheat allergy didn't know they were GF!  That is unheard of with the other mixes I have tried.  Before, I'd make something, we'd bite into it and we'd look at each other with that \"\"better luck with the next mix\"\" looks on our faces.  But this mix is tops!I cannot wait to make other things with this mix, and I hear the bread mix is wonderful too.  THANK YOU PAMELA!\"", "I was really hoping the positive reviews were accurate for me (meaning same tastes in food) as I have been expensively disappointed in the past w/ a few of the 5 star food reviews. I just finished my first pancakes. They were very good as they looked and tasted like typical pancakes-well, maybe a little lighter and tastier. I was VERY pleased and will try the other recipes on the package. To make the standard pancakes, it only took one egg, one tbsp. of oil and 3/4 cup of water. Since i cooked them using my Anolon titanium pan, no oil was required. Quick, easy and delicious topped only w/ organic maple syrup. Enjoy!", "I have been using Pamela's Pancake Mix for many years and was very happy when I found this extra large (compared to her other bags of mix) Baking and Pancake Mix. If you don't want to have a bunch of different flours sitting around in your pantry and fridge, this is the way to go. All mixed up for use in minutes...in one bag. I have made some exceptional muffins from this mix as well as pancakes and a variety of other goodies with the recipes that are all on the back of the bag. This is one mix I will continue to keep on hand.", "This mix upholds the high standard of Pamela's Products.  It makes the best coffee cake I've ever had, a lovely, flaky biscuit, and wonderful cookies.  The flavor is light and not too sweet--perfect for sweeter pastry uses.  The mix produces a soft, tender textured good.  It has an almond base, something to be aware of for those allergic.  I will keep this mix in my GF pantry, indeed.  Best of all, I have no gluten reactions to it."], "Gamma": [0.03824393078684807, 0.02562776766717434, 0.03655644878745079, 0.0236444640904665, 0.0326884500682354, 0.03128489479422569,
