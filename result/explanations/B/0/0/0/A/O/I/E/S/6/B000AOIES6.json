Pirates follows your character, a nameless family member who's entire extended family is captured by a quitessential evil baron, and sent to the Americas. You follow as a member of a various faction (British, Spanish, French, Dutch) in order to resuce them, becoming a privateer in the meantime. As you work for various governments capturing ships and cargo, you garner lands and titles, discover hidden Incan cities, plunder buried prate treasure, and confront famous pirates past. You can also woe and dance your spare hours aware with the governers daughter.Combat is this game is pathetically easy. Ram ship, dispatch enemy captain, hooray. However, if you're feelnig malicious, you can blast away sails, grapeshot the crew overboard, or sink her with roundshot, even after they run up the white. You also aren't belabored with crippled ships (Your ship, the flagship, sets the pace) This doesn't make it any less fun. Sacking cities is a bit trickier, and can require some significant strategy in order to prevail against greater numbers.Travel is sometimes annoying. The windlass is a bit misleading, and different ships run into or in front of the wind in ways that sometimes don't make sense, but a through explanation of wind and ship types helps with this. Morale also plummets at odd times, unless theres a steady stream of treasure incoming, which there usually is. Side quests, while repetitive, don't lose their charm for being integral to the progression of the various settlements. Probably my only real infuriating complaint is Simese, which I've hated since the release of the Sims. As they added enough voices that they're rarely repeated, I'd have thought a halfway decent voice acting cast would've been just as easy to run.Overall, this game is fanstastic. Fun, engaging, relatively frustrating at times, and it actually manages to convey a sense of adventure. Only a few annoyances with the system and setup prevent it from being perfect. Its also safe for all ages, though younger kids probably won't get some of the theme. And despite its age, its graphics and sound still are good enough to get a thumbs up. Considering its now in bargain bins across the land, go pick it up.", "We played Pirates! back on the old Commodore 64 and it was one of our favorite games of all time, so we were thrilled when we saw that there was a release for the PC. This plays a lot like the original game and is still an exceptionally fun game.The basic goal of the game is to rise as high as possible by building a reputation, wealth, and completing missions for various leaders (governors, priests, etc).Your reputation will be important as you attempt to impress the various governor's daughters (ultimately seeking the hand of one in marriage). Dancing with the daughters is very important and you will need to do it a lot, but it is also the one aspect of the game that I don't like as it does get somewhat repetitive.There are several basic ways to get wealth, but preying on ships of whatever country is at war with yours is one of the fastest. I really enjoy the ship to ship and captain to captain combat that is involved in capturing other ships, but watch out for the pirate hunters that seek you out when you become more famous. You can also gather pieces of treasure maps that will lead to hordes of gold, but that generally takes more time.Like all pirate captains you have to make some tough choices and worry about keeping your crew happy (or you might find yourself on the wrong end of a mutiny).This is an addictive game that can be played over and over but one complaint from my daughter is that you can only be a male in the game.Recommended!CFH", "I've always wanted to do a review couched as an interview within the game universe - somewhat like a turducken, as it were. So what would happen if one of Sid Meier's Pirates! showed up on a TV show?Q: Our interview today is with someone who says he is Sid Meier's Pirate, and that he is living large and laughing easy.A: Yes, you could say I'm living the life.Q: What do you do?A: I'm a pirate. I live the life. Isn't that obvious from the title?Q: What does that mean?A: I attack ships, loot them and sell their goods for profit.Q: So this is a trading game.A: No, there's much much more to my lifestyle than trading.Q: What else do you do?A: I also engage in swashbuckling sword fights.Q: Sounds macho.A: And I dance.Q: Maybe not that macho.A: Why you mangy cur, I will have you know that I have a governor's daughter waiting for me in every port! Plus I'll also have you know that I'm considering competing in Dancing With The Stars.Q: You would probably do OK if DWTS was a square dancing competition. But let's move on. So you're saying you're like the Port Royale series, but without the repetitive gameplay.A: Hey my gameplay gets pretty repetitive too after a while. And by the way, don't mention Port Royale in my presence or I will have my crew cut out your tongue.Q: So you're like Patrician then?A: I am nothing like it. How dare you compare me with that upstart game?Q: Then you are related to Patrician II?A: If you mention the name Patrician ever again either I swear I will make you walk the plank.Q: Patrician III, Rise of the Hanse?A: There was a time when my word was law and if you did not obey my every command you would face my wrath and pay a terrible price for your insolence.Q: Patrician IV?A: I grow weary of this. The standards of today's interviewers are lamentable. Whatever happened to Larry King? He was good.", "\"After reading all the positive comments on both gamespot and amazon about this game, I ordered it through amazon with the highest expectations. The result: a very mediocre game that is very disconnected and frustrating.I have a fascination with pirates, I've read several books on the \"\"real\"\" life pirates of the 16th and 17th centuries. While it's true that all the stuff you would want in a pirate game is present: buried tresure, swordfights, ship battles, land battles, etc. etc, each of these events are represented in their very own boring and most of the time, corny mini-game.Actually navigating your ship is really frustrating. I still haven't figured it out. The wind blows in a certain direction, and if you are not headed in that direction your ship moves at a snails pace. It takes forever to get from one end of the map to the other. The rest of the minigames are either really boring or just plain corny. For example, one minigame involves dancing to impress the Governor's daughter. Dancing around like a fancy boy is not what being a pirate is all about, let's get real. Ship battles are cool, but if your ship is somewhat far apart from your enemy it's VERY difficult to get close to them. For some reason in the ship battle mode your ship doesn't really move at all.The swordfighting is ok, but is pretty cheesy and gets boring very quickly while the land battles are excruciatingly slow. It's like moving chess pieces. Buried treasure I haven't even tried yet because the map they give you to find is very difficult to read.All in all, I really don't understand the high reviews for this game. The game is VERY disconnected and just really not that fun. I do not recommend this game to anyone.\"", "\"I will not say that this game does not have its problems the most annoying aspect of which is dancing with the governor's daughter  500 times (that's not an exaggeration I counted) there is also the issue of the repetition of the vast majority of the cut scenes.  However I will say for all of its faults the game is fun to play.  A couple of hours spent blasting Dutch or Spanish shipping is never a waste of time.  Some battles require a battlewagon with 45 guns others require a lighter faster ship, your choiceOverall-I don't think people need to lower their expectations about a game or anything but they do need to quite acting like every game they play is going to be the \"\"best game ever\"\" you're just setting yourself up for disappointment when you go into a situation like that.\"", "\"I had already purchased some pirate-themed video games over the past couple of years and became glad that I threw my hat into that genre.  Apparently this genre is unique in that it involves elements of both role-playing games and action adventures.  The other pirate games I have played focus on the main theme of trade, which is fun from the business and economy sense.  (Buy low and sell high; the more money you make, the more expensive features become available.)Sid Meier's Pirates! deviates from those games, though.  (Actually, this game concept came out in 1987, so perhaps the other games deviated from this one.)  Pirates! is based on an objective-clearing system (the more objectives cleared - and there are many - the higher your ranking), though it is open-ended to the point that you fulfill those ones you want to and with what priority.Some of these objectives include:*  Rescuing family members - gather maps and learn secrets to their whereabouts*  Finding buried treasure - you actually disembark from your ship, walk on land with a small band of mates, and compare your location to the map markers*  Courting Governors' daughters - this involves the eight directions of movement that must be done in sync with your female counterpart*  Sea battles - this is how you make your money, pick up some loot, and make your fellow sailors happy*  Attacking towns - if you tick off one of the four nations (Spain, France, England, Holland) too much, you will have difficulty entering their ports.  What finer excuse to engage in an in-game strategy interface and try to take the town by positioning range and melee units on a board map?There are other objectives in this game, as well, which bring out the great strategic and action value of this game.  Thus, the true genius of Pirates! is the amalgamation of action, adventure, strategy, and role-playing games all into one title.  I have not seen this level of diversity in a video game before, and I must say that this was perhaps the best $10 I ever spent on entertainment!The music and the graphics of Pirates! are somewhat sub-par for what we are used to nowadays, I must admit.  However, the game concepts are so simple, yet so diverse, that you won't totally be bothered by the sound or visuals.  Actually, the graphics of the ocean and land while you are at sea are pretty fantastic, though you will notice that some things just don't add up when you consider real-time events.On that topic (real time events), I think that is the greatest weakness of Pirates!  But again, the diversity of the game somehow makes up for that.  What I mean by weakness in real time events are these:A) You have the ability to sneak into enemy towns.  This is a great concept, but everything is done in super slow motion - even when you are running: your character slowly lifts his legs as he spacewalks through the beautiful Caribbean town, yet he is still able to turn on a dime.B) Sea battles appear slow-moving, but the awkwardness comes when trying to orient yourself with your surroundings: the water does not move according to the wind, so you cannot gage your movements, speed, or acceleration except by noticing the numbers changing on the screen.  Thus, you are really just moving in relation to your opponent, which is somewhat daft.  And finally,(C) Moving around on land does not show on your maps.  Also, you cannot cross one side of an island to the other and find a town waiting for you, as on the regular map.  I'm not sure what the limitations were to the programming here, but you will find some hold-backs that are hard to fathom in a truly \"\"open ended game.\"\"  I guess everything can't be perfect.To close, I highly recommend this game, Sid Meier's Pirates! for everyone who prefers video games as opposed to going out to crowded movie theaters (where people whisper, cell phones distract you, and atypical behavior is bound to happen).  I offer this comparison because Pirates! feels like a movie that I am scripting as I play it.  With the action sequences that I engage in, it makes movies somewhat worthless - I'd rather interact in my own pirate film than just sitting there watching it!  Swordplay is something I can't come by in my everyday life, for example, so watching someone else do it is cool.  But if I make the determination to swing low while my opponent goes high, and thus stabbing him over the side of the boat, I would say that that beats watching others on a movie screen any day.Given cost, excitement and interaction levels, and convenience, Pirates! at $10 is one \"\"movie ticket\"\" that can be replayed over and over again and will save you the hassle of inconsiderate, snot-nosed patrons all around you - this will be your new \"\"movie channel\"\" for a while.  Also, the replay value for Pirates! is very high - try coming back to this game after putting it down for a couple months.  It's like brand new.  Lastly, I'd say that this game still stands above the other pirate-themed video games that I have played; and this genre has turned out to be one of my favorites.  I think Sid Meier's Pirates! is probably king of the pirates video game genre.  Also, the ease of simply picking up this game and playing it says a lot: challenging, yet fun and easy to learn.  Gotta love that.So buy Sid Meier's Pirates for $10.  It'll be one of the better investments in entertainment in your life.\"", "I played the original and I always thought it was fun, but it was really old.  I was really glad when this game came out because it touted itself as an updated Pirates!  And boy is it!  This game is so simple and that makes it so much fun.  You basically go around on a ship and find treasure, attack cities, trade, woo women, sword fight, get into ship battles, and rescue your family!  All the while you have to deal with the weather, repairs, food, and mutiny.  There are also plenty of missions to go on.  The game is really endearing too.  It's just plain fun.The only downside I can possibly think of is how every town pretty much looks the same.  They may have certain unique features like what they sell or something, but for the most part, they are all the same.  I didn't really mind this since the focus of the game aren't the ports.  It's about going out on the open sea and being a pirate.  In that respect, this game blows everyone else out of the water.  Buy this if you can!", "Just recieved today the 19th was not supposed to be here until the 25th, so I surprised and thrilled. Game is very good and awesome.Great game!!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.004056641366332769, 0.006451276130974293, 0.1570127159357071, 0.21908123791217804, 0.04339867830276489, 0.2487817108631134, 0.09106756001710892, 0.23015013337135315]]}
