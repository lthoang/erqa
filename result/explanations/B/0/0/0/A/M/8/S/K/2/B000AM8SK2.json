Worked great for years, but you better plug in all your cables ahead of time. There is no room to get your hands behind this thing when a TV is on it. Also best like the angle it is pointed. Get long screwdrivers to get it on and off too. Otherwise yes it was great!", "I used this with the Panasonic TH-42PX600U.  Mounted it in the corner after building a wooden frame.While the hardware supplied was numerous (in order to accommodate various televisions), I still had an issue with the spacers I was supposed to use when bolting the brackets into the back of the television. They were either too big or too small.  I called the company support desk, but the person with whom I spoke did not really sound as though he knew what he was talking about.  Hence I decided to take matters into my own hand and use some other washers of my own.  After that, the installation was flawless.", "I am very happy with this mount.  I had considered going with some much more expensive mounts, but I am glad I didnt.  Total installation took about an hour, and no hickups along the way.I would strongly suggest getting a really good stud finder to be 100% certain you are in the middle of the studs.  I used a standard stud finder and had some trouble determining the dead center.  I was lucky to have a vent on the floor that had one of the studs visible underneath, some basic measuring found center easily.This is a great product and my TV looks amazing on the wall now.", "this mount does what its suppose to do for a decent price. Seems solid on the wall. Just make sure you place all your cables behind your tv before mounting it to the wall because it wil become a hassle if you dont.", "\"The price is right, so I can't complain much. The only issue I had was a stud right in the middle of where the mount needed to be mounted, but there are no holes there. I had to drill my own holes in the center of the mount, but after that installation was simple.Tilting is easy, and I was able to mount the 42\"\" plasma by myself due to the design of the mount.It looks great!Similar items from Best Buy or even Wal-Mart are about 40 to $60 more dollars, and that makes this item from Amazon an GREAT value!Even if you don't have enough studs to attach the mount to, it can work. Mine is mounted with two screws to a center stud (Where I drilled holes through the center of the mount), and on each end I used toggle bolts. It holds the weight of a 42\"\" plasma just fine with this configuration even though it's not the recommended method.Highly recommended!!!\"", "Great open design behind the TV to run electrical outlets and wires.  Great made mount.", "\"Despite my concerns about mounting my precious flat screen on the wall, I agreed when my husband suggested this purchase as it would enhance the look of our television room.  It was very easy to measure out where it needed to be and took just a few minutes to install.  There was no problem attaching the television (40\"\").  We have been using it for a few weeks now with no issues and we do not anticipate any.\"", "\"I found this product to be excellent. I was a little hesitant about hanging my brand newSamsung LNT4665F 46\"\" 1080p LCD HDTVon the wall, for fear it wouldn't hold, but once I open this up, I knew that it wouldn't be an issue. Very sturdy, and easy enough to install with minimal help from others... although, it'd be much easier to have somebody to help place the TV once hung.\"", "What a great product! The installation was super easy and fast. It came with all of the hardware and then some. I highly recommend the Peerless brand and the price I paid was absolutely rock bottom. I'm not easily impressed but this product did.ToolNut", "\"Mount came with everything I needed and it was able to handle my new Samsung 52\"\" LCD with ease.  Installed in minutes and still there.....  :-)\"", "UPDATE:This update is unusual since it replaces my entire review. I should be reviewing the product you would get if you bought this, but I have no idea what product that might be. When I first bought this product, I went to the Peerless website and found detailed technical drawings that gave every detail about measurement and construction. So I'm 100% sure that the mount I got was exactly what Peerless intended. When I noticed that the picture now looks nothing like the mount I own, I went back to the Peerless website to assure that what Amazon has is consistent with what Peerless claims.Some manufacturers claim that specs are subject to change without notice, but what's the difference between one mount and another aside from design? The one that now has the SAME model number as mine has a backing plate that's barely more than a top and bottom strip. It lacked enough metal for heavier TVs when I bought it, and now they are expecting you to rely on REVIEWS OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT to decide whether to buy the current inferior looking one.I'd recommend an AmazonBasics mount instead. They weigh twice as much because they don't leave out the metal. They give you better mounting brackets, a wall plate with a built in level, a stud finder, pivoting bottom latches instead of awkward to reach set screws, and the ability to tilt the TV without awkward lock knobs on each side. I expected the AmazonBasics mount to be ... basic. But I was more than pleasantly surprised by it, and when I checked back on this model to compare specs, I was shocked by what the company did.Don't get me wrong. This worked adequately for a 46 inch TV when I first got it, but they are no longer giving you the same product. I don't have confidence that I would find the current ones adequate because I did not find their mounting plates adequate across their entire product line back then.If I expected that you would end up with the mount I got, I'd say that it deserved four stars when I bought it. But there's more competition now, so even the old mount is not the deal it once was."], "Gamma": [0.05185629799962044, 0.05222076177597046, 0.05222076177597046, 0.04189179092645645,
