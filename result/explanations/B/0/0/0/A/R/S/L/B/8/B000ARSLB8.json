It goes well with my second generation Nano.  It is pretty compact, you can charge it to play off site and I have done that several times until recently when the battery stopped charging.  Now, I use at home connected to socket but aside from that I am still a happy user.", "I have owned this stereo system of 2 and a half years now, and because I am still giving this a 4 star review, you should know basically where I stand, albeit with 1 objection.This speakers are amazing for the most part, in that it gives excellent sound, it radiates and fills a room marvelously, and is compact and stylish. It has a button to push so that it creates a more surrounded sound, and my guess is that option uses more battery. The sound is certainly better with this function turned on, so I would recommend using it, but this is where I get a little dissapointed. The battery life just doesn't seem to last as long as I would want it too. It does last a good 2 hours of constant playing which is good I hear, but after listening to music, it just seems like such a short time. It also takes almost as long to charge it back up.So there you have it, this is a solid, reliable, excellent quality stereo system for your Ipod, but the battery life is less than spectacular for me, and the charging is less than exciting. I also wish the spacing was a little bigger so you didn't have to take off the case, if you have one, to play it.", "I haven't heard or seen this item.  Based on the Logitech reputation and reviews on Amazon, we sent one to our God-Daughter in another state for Christmas.  She called us immediately, a rarity for a 15 year old, to tell us how thrilled she was with it. I told her what reviewers had said about pointing the remote directly at the unit, but other than that, there didn't seem to be any cons.  Over a year later she is still excited about our gift and uses it constantly.", "I have recently found myself living in a motel & missing my stereo. So after reading all the reviews yesterday, I went out & bought these speakers and am sitting here trying to decide if I'll keep them - I have to go back to the store anyway because the remote doesn't work. (not a question of distance, I'm sitting next to the speakers)I usually don't stint when buying speakers or headphones - in sound equipment, you almost always get what you pay for. But given the added expense of the motel,  these speakers appeared to be a good compromise between what I want, and what I could afford.And that's what they are - a compromise. On the positive side, there is good clarity & separation of sound - the vocals especially sound true to the singer's voice. On that basis, the unit rates 5 stars. I've always found that if you can hear the reverb they added to the vocals in the studio, you are hearing what's been recorded cleanly.But I'm a little disappointed with the fullness of the sound - so the 4 star rating. As people have written, there is sound distortion when the sound is cranked up, and it seems like the sound often needs to be cranked up a bit. Playing with the iPod's EQ has helped somewhat, but still there is a thinness to the sound that is due to what the speakers can realistically deliver.So now we have to deal with realistic expectations.  As these are my first iPod speakers, I can't compare them to other specifically iPod products. I've only listened to the iPod through headphones or my car stereo, and since these speakers are 15% of the price of the ones in the car, they are not going to sound as good. They can't.But the system has a nice complement of features - will work with dock iPods and/or other systems throught the aux input. It will work plugged in or on batteries. And the sound clarity is better than speakers in this price range ususally have. This combination, if I can get a working remote, sounds like a keeper to me.", "For a small package, this unit has very good sound, a good remote.  It is also handy to use with the battery power option.", "received the speaker unit as usedthe first impression is able to run with built-in battery, this is very handy to play everywheresound is about the same as JBL radial micro, but this speaker has 2 passive radiators, while JBL uses all 4 active speakers with bass reflex portthe buttons are kinda hard to press, as well as remoteI tested this speaker with iPhone and iPhone 3G (borrowed), it can charge both; it also works with bluetooth adaptor when plugged, but iPod interface will be cutoff when AUX is plugged (still can charge iPod though)the built-in battery is kinda small, about 2x size of C size batteries, the capacity should be 7.4V with around 700mA/h, this should be enough for several hours listening without plugged inthere's ONE thing I deduct a star: the volume control resets sometimes, but this is not a big dealnow Logitech has a new version (PureFi anywhere), sound is same as this unitI recommend this unit if you can find it, or PureFi anywhere, buy bluetooth adaptor for ipod speaker to make it wireless speaker for you phone, pda, or computer", "I was very very impressed with the mm50 speakersSound quality-wise, these may be the best out there ---- I have a tough time telling these ones apart from the Bose ones (which I consider to be the best)Honestly, it is probably equal, and maybe even, better than the Bose speakers ----- and at this price, they are also cheaper and smallerthe mm50's are definitely packing much better sound quality than any of the Altec Lansings I have tried (including the iM7)For portability, I think this is the best package out thereFor loudness, you might be better off with the iM7's, but still, I found these to get very high volume, while still maintaining an acoustic crispnessAnd for sound quality, you can pick between these and the Bose - but you won't go wrong with these oneshappy buying!!!", "Bought this for my eleven year old to go with her iPod Nano. Sounds good, easy to use. Cannot navigate from playlist to playlist with the remote, you have to do it on the iPod. Can't comment on battery life, its been plugged into AC since Christmas. It has an external input jack for portable CD player or whatever new or old technology using a stereo mini.", "\"No one has time any more to sit in front of the component stereo they constructed piece by piece over the course of many years and only after repeated visits to hi-fi shops to compare various speakers and combinations.  And not that the car stereo was ever an acceptable substitute, but I don't drive enough any more to listen to the music I'd like to hear.Enter the iPod and the portable speaker-dock, of which I've collected easily more than I'll ever need.  The latest acquisition is this Logitech mm50 which, in terms of style, features, price is closest to the popular Altec Lansing IM600, though it lacks Altec's radio (which I find too insensitive to be of much use).  The Logitech's dimensions are a bit longer, but it's also a tad lighter and thinner, easily slipping into its included carrying bag and, if anything, seeming more compact and portable than the Altec.  Like the Altec, the highs and mid-range are brilliant and the bass \"\"acceptable\"\" (I'm not a bass freak, but I'm surprised at the glowing testimonials some reviewers give to the bass reproduction of either of these units). It's true that both will handle boomy, punchy bass tones, but if, for example, I'm playing a jazz recording with walking bass lines supplied by Hammond B3 organ, the bass simply isn't \"\"there.\"\"  Otherwise, both speakers are bright, full, and sufficiently \"\"loud,\"\" with the Logitech having a more striking \"\"stereo expander\"\" effect, as a result of its greater length (as well as circuitry designed to optimize the effect).So far the best thing about the Logitech is that it continues to play three different iPod models without throwing the temper tantrums of the Altec.  The instructions with the Altec provide one terse sentence covering instances of \"\"erratic behavior\"\": dismantle the case and disconnect the rechargeable battery for 30 seconds (not a \"\"consumer-friendly\"\" action but one I've had to perform several times). That's a no-no as far as Logitech is concerned, and thankfully it hasn't been necessary.  The Altec started automatically shutting down and rejecting iPods when I began switching from Nano to Classic to Touch.  Altec includes a bag full of adapters for different iPods, but it appears to be the only manufacturer that doesn't bother to label them, indicating the particular iPod model for which each is intended.  By contrast, the Logitech uses 3 effective \"\"cradles.\"\"  The company also supplies clear instructions for mounting the iPod securely in the dock, and its website is more user-friendly, detailed and helpful than Altec's.The most dependable and useful portable iPod speaker dock is the relatively inexpensive iRhythms by Cyber Acoustics. Although the sound isn't as full, or spacious, it's still competitive, covering the entire frequency range.  It comes with a small power transformer and takes quick and convenient AA non-rechargeable batteries for portable use.  If you don't require a portable speaker, the Athena iVoice is among the least expensive iPod speakers available and blows away any of the aforementioned speakers with its stunning, very present (but not \"\"boomy\"\") bass frequencies.The Logitech is made by a Swiss company, and the Altec by Plantronics.  JBL, a speaker system I have with 14\"\" as well as 2\"\" woofers, is part of Harmon-Kardon systems.  It too makes credible portable dock-speakers, though their radial, flying-saucer design is what sets them apart.[I retested the above contentions, putting on Sinatra's \"\"Too Marvelous for Words\"\" from \"\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers.\"\"  The voice has great \"\"presence\"\" on the Logitech and  Altec, but the notes of the acoustic bass are faint and indistinct compared to a Kloss Tivoli Model One radio (still a value at $120, with a tuner compared to which the Altec's is a joke).  When played through the Athena iVoice, the acoustic bass is right in the room with me.  Unfortunately, the Athena currently isn't showing at the deeply discounted price, though it's still worth the asking price, imo.]\""], "Gamma": [0.19592775404453278, 0.19592775404453278, 0.19592775404453278, 0.19592775404453278, 0.2162889540195465], "Beta": [[0.13541442155838013, 0.2657337784767151, 0.23699522018432617, 0.22270101308822632, 0.13729672133922577, 0.0005105528980493546, 0.0006223261007107794, 0.0003439247084315866, 0.00038195858360268176], [0.13541442155838013, 0.2657337784767151, 0.23699522018432617, 0.22270101308822632, 0.13729672133922577, 0.0005105528980493546, 0.0006223261007107794, 0.0003439247084315866, 0.00038195858360268176], [0.13541442155838013, 0.2657337784767151, 0.23699522018432617, 0.22270101308822632, 0.13729672133922577, 0.0005105528980493546, 0.0006223261007107794, 0.0003439247084315866, 0.00038195858360268176], [0.13541442155838013, 0.2657337784767151, 0.23699522018432617, 0.22270101308822632, 0.13729672133922577, 0.0005105528980493546, 0.0006223261007107794, 0.0003439247084315866, 0.00038195858360268176], [0.12124664336442947, 0.273617148399353, 0.24077002704143524, 0.2193184345960617, 0.14291848242282867, 0.000691187335178256, 0.0009841532446444035, 0.00035181184648536146, 0.00010206278238911182]]}
