If you're not familiar with 120 film (not every pharmacy develops 120 film), then you should do a little research before you buy this camera ([...]). Most folks buy this as secondary camera, or just as a fun camera. The picture quality is different from camera to camera, and is not par with digitals. It does take unique shots, it is a cheaply priced camera, it feels cheap in your hands. I give it five stars, because for the price it captures my surroundings in a way that no digital can replicate.", "Photog snobs love these, and I understand why.  Just don't trust your memories to it because every shot comes out looking different.", "This is a great little plastic camera that is tons of fun to shoot and has taught me much about photography in the process.  Because the only real flexibility with the camera is your film choice and all its other parameters are pretty much fixed, it really forces you to think more about the photo itself and less on the technical specs of the camera resulting in better images.  It's so refreshing to not have to scroll through pages and pages of menus on a little LCD screen to set up a shot.  Despite being labeled as a toy camera and often described as a poorly constructed piece of crap (which is true to a degree), if you can understand the very basics of how a camera functions and apply it in your shots, you can take some unbelievable pictures with this thing.  And because you don't get an unlimited number of shots like digital, you'll end up with far fewer crap shots taking up space on your hard drive.  For less than the price of a spare digital camera battery, you really can't go wrong going Holga.Oh- if you plan on shooting some black and white, consider learning how to develop the film yourself.  It's not that difficult and will save you loads of money in the long run.Update 8-29-11:After having had this camera for well over a year now, it has become my favorite tool for capturing memorable photos.  After slowly learning the intricacies of my camera (they're all slightly different from what I hear), I can reliably take pictures with confidence that they'll turn out more or less as intended.  During my last few vacations, the shots from this beast have consistently been my favorites; I'm convinced that it's due to the fact that this camera forces you to be creative in order to overcome its technical limitations.  Highly recommended.", "\"After reading everything I could get my hands on about the 120 medium format film 'plastic' Holga cameras and the advantages of the newer 120N model (since 2009) improvements,  I thought this \"\"Holgawood\"\" would include the two 'distinct' aperture settings.  Well, it doesn't.  Contrary to what the enclosed manual would indicate, the aperture settings should be roughly f/11 for sunny and f/8 for cloudy conditions.  Sun and Cloud settings are exactly the same in my camera, (the utterly useless swinging arm for the sunny aperture is a rectangular shaped window that is larger than the stationary aperture for cloudy).  What's with that???.  The other improvements are a centered tripod mount socket on the lens housing (not camera body) and a wider shutter arm, both of which are present with my camera.I purchased this \"\"Holgawood\"\" camera for $39.99 hoping that the extra $10 bucks (from base price) included 'all' newer upgrades along with the optional color choices.  I am disappointed with the single aperture setting, thus the 4 star rating.  I previously read through all that I could find in terms of customer reviews to these newer Holgas and no one mentions the internal specs to their given model, so I took a chance. :/  I would like to find a Holga 120N that does in fact have the two distinct apertures, a significant improvement IMO.  On-line product descriptions and included manuals have proven worthless!I do love the violet/purple color of my plastic camera, however, and the randomness in final photo results I find both fascinating and charming.  I removed the frame insert to increase vignetting as I prefer the 6x6 format.  The scarcity of 120 film processing with regard to the limited 12 exposures each roll yields gives pause to really consider what you are photographing.  Quite a contrast from today's DSLR camera with instant playback and continuous shutter release on a 32GB memory card.\"", "The logical progression from the original Holga 120S is this camera, the Holga 120N. It stays true to the original, but with some minor improvements:  a brass tripod socket, bulb exposure setting, and foam cushion film tensioner. It's got the same plastic lens, which captures the heart and soul of just about any photographic moment...try that with a digital! I suggest that you purchase two...one for color work, and one for black & white film. Also, get the optional 6x6cm frame mask to take advantage of the awesome vignetting.", "Holgas are known for being toy cameras and that's what it is. a Toy Camera. Don't expect clarity and sharp images. Its going to be foggy, a little out of focus with heavy vignetting. It's fun with lighting in the sun. i use a wireless trigger to set off the flash and i love it. It does double exposure. I wouldn't even bother trying to focus with it its fin wide open. Its a conversation starter and customization. I've added Velcro to hold it shut and a 52mm lens on front to use filters.", "\"For me the question wasn't \"\"should I get a Holga?\"\", but \"\"which Holga should I get\"\".There's a bunch of options but I decided on this one based on the reviews and price.  The only thing really missing is a flash, But I already had a Holga flash I bought previously for my other Lomo cameras.For the price, this is a great toy.  It's easy to load/use, and takes great shots.  In my opinion, you really can't get duplicate Holga shots with a camera phone and filter application.If you're interested in Lomography, I'd highly recommended starting with this camera.  It's so simple to use.\""], "Gamma": [0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05355888232588768, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.04959437623620033, 0.05356296896934509, 0.053515996783971786, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.05356296896934509, 0.03988335281610489, 0.05356582999229431], "Beta": [[0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696433544159, 0.36411339044570923, 0.0007720842259004712, 0.00013504098751582205, 0.012729798443615437, 0.0012386556481942534, 0.4460413157939911], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.17497055232524872, 0.36411282420158386, 0.0007721922011114657, 0.00013506488176062703, 0.01273113302886486, 0.0012388068716973066, 0.4460394084453583], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.17663970589637756, 0.3635435998439789, 0.0008661489118821919, 0.00015423774311784655, 0.0134574044495821, 0.0013635378563776612, 0.44397538900375366], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.17497588694095612, 0.3641054332256317, 0.0007733634556643665, 0.00013531159493140876, 0.01274524349719286, 0.0012403250439092517, 0.44602441787719727], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1749696135520935, 0.364113450050354, 0.0007720836438238621, 0.000135040856548585, 0.012729796580970287, 0.001238654600456357, 0.44604137539863586], [0.1781465858221054, 0.3615902066230774, 0.0011683240300044417, 0.0002240523463115096, 0.017263108864426613, 0.001786590670235455, 0.4398212134838104], [0.17496591806411743, 0.36411193013191223, 0.0007721506990492344, 0.00013504389789886773, 0.012730391696095467, 0.0012386363232508302, 0.4460458755493164]]}
