It was plug-and-play on both a Mac with Snow Leopard and a PC with Windows XP, however I assume to get the fourth button working on Windows I would have needed to install the included software (unlike on OS X which let me configure it in System Preferences without any extra software). If you're left-handed, of course, you might not get as much benefit from the button because it'd be a little hard to reach.It's fairly comfortable to use and works well. There's slightly more traction than I would like between the mouse and my mousepad, but it's not the end of the world. The scroll wheel however is kinda weird: It has a lot of resistance when you turn it, but if you spin it a few times it acts like it has almost no resistance.", "I go through one of these about every two years. First, the work great. Then, the button switches become slightly intermittent and take longer to work. Just when I think my PC is getting slow, or worry that my browser is corrupted, the switch starts to just plain NOT WORK when I click.Why buy one? Because this mouse feels better, causes less hand and arm fatigue, and is more accurate than any other pointing device I've tried.Occasional replacement is a small price to pay for comfort and performance.", "I had a lot of problems with mice over the years so I went out and bought this one a few months ago for my work computer after the old one went on the fritz. At home I have the wireless Microsoft model which continues to work great, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a second one. Further, for what I do the mouse has to be durable...which this one certainly is. I'm constantly taking it out and packing it up and have had no problems regarding the wire or its responsiveness. With the USB plug-ins, I've found that the wire cuts down on the potential difficulties that you may have. Also, I like that I'm not perpetually changing batteries. I got this one on the cheap from a big box store and have no complaints with it whatsoever.", "I forgot to bring a mouse for my business trip and this was the cheapest thing they had at Staples. You can't beat the price, but you can beat just about everything else. The mouse is quite big, which is fine, because it's comfortable. The body is just like theMicrosoft Intellimouse Optical Mouse. What's really awful is the scrollwheel! It's too tight, like trying to peddle a bike while holding the brake handles. It requires extra effort to turn and leads to finger fatigue. Most wheel mice also make an audible clacking noise when the scroll wheel is turned. This one does not.One of its selling points is 4 way scrolling. You can tilt the mouse wheel left and right to scroll horizontally, but I couldn't get this to work out of the box. You probably need to install additional software on the CD for this, which I didn't care to do because it's a useless feature to me.For a cheap disposable mouse you'll only need for a few days, this is adequate. For long term use, go with another mouse because the wheel will drive you crazy.", "\"Love it, got it working as soon as it showed up.  Still dinking around getting all the options working like I want them to, but I'll figure it out eventually.  Could have used a better \"\"guide\"\", the on disk help is a bit tough to open up, and find stuff on, but there ya go.CCW\"", "Was still using an old generic ball mouse so wanted to replace that with an optical.  Having used wireless models in the past, I specifically wanted to avoid that as they always have issues with batteries needing a recharge or some wireless comm problem.  I tried out many different mice and aimed for one that had a good grip but also clicked quietly.  Quiet clicking was of utmost importance.  Sadly, half of the display models clicked much too loud.  I decided to stick with the MS 3000 mouse since it was the quietest clicker and fit my hand quite well.  Once installed, I enjoy how the mouse wheel accelerates just right without clicking sounds as well.  I set the extra side button as my back button on the browser since I'm always using that keypress on the keyboard, good bonus feature.  Overall, a great quiet mouse!", "I bought this mouse to accessorize the Toshiba T135 I bought for my mom, and tested it before I handed her the system.Upon installation, there is an instruction asking you to install the software before hooking up the mouse.  As I tried to do that, something says the software cannot be installed onto Win 7, since it was designed in the Vista age.  Believing Microsoft will support its own device, I hooked it up anyway, and Win 7 got the driver from Windows Update, an it worked fine since then.The mouse is a little picky at the surface, as it doesnt work all that well on my cooffee table, which is all black, but it works well everywhere else.  It does fine on my couch, which compensates the shortage on th coffee table, and it also works fine on my mom's computer table.My general impression is that it's one of the most precise mouse I've used, while the surface works.  It's very easy to tell whether that surface works well by the way, since when it doesn't work, the cursor barely moves.", "\"I miss my old \"\"Dove soap bar\"\" Microsoft Mouse 2.0. That said, this mouse is the latest in a long line of good, basic, classic mice. It is the symmetrical design that, well, I prefer, and it has the benefit of having a larger scroll wheel than some of the newer pointing devices on the market. Unlike previous MS mice, this wheel does not have \"\"click gradations,\"\" so you may have to get used to the \"\"free\"\" scrolling action.But overall, the size is good for an average man's hand, the buttons large with positive feedback, and the click action of the scroll wheel is near effortless. Both vertical and new, horizontal scrolling is handy in some larger applications. It makes scrolling in Excel on both axes (up/down, left/right) PARTICULARLY convenient.The addition of the third, thumb button can be used for any number of very useful functions, programmed with the IntelliPoint software. The long list includes a magnifying pane, double-clicking, page navigation in Explorer and Internet browsers,  Show/hide desktop, and a rather interesting \"\"Gaming toggle\"\" to which you can program two sets of keystrokes. It can also be clicked to boost precision, to exert extra-fine control of your cursor movement; users of Photoshop, Windows Movie Maker  and large screen resolutions (1600x1200 and up) will really appreciate this toggle.If you're looking for a simple, affordable mouse for your desktop, or to travel with your laptop, it's hard to find as good a mouse, at as affordable a price. Last bonus: it looks nice, not garish.\"", "I've been using this almost daily for 2 years. This mouse is well designed, very comfortable, and a perfect match with Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.The right button just gave out yesterday, after almost 2 years of continuous use. Since we're talking about a mouse here, I kind of hope that it would last 5+ years like keyboards, monitors, etc.", "I bought several Microsoft mice and this is the one I finally kept.  I am very picky about my mice.  This one has a nice soft touch to the buttons and a nice smooth feel on the scroll wheel.  It is better to have a corded version, rather than wireless, because the wireless models have a slight lag which can get annoying.  I discovered that the most expensive models are not always the best ones.  I put a lot of emphasis on the ergonomic feel, and this is my favorite.", "I forget exactly where all of them are - but they're nice for the portable computers - I just hate that touchpad. Very responsive and can be used for macro commands or programmed to just about any variation.", "As an life long Mac head, I am pleased to have found a product with a Microsoft label on it that works well, is easy to use, and appears to provide Apple-like customer satisfaction.  I found it!  It's the Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000.  This is a great product!! This mouse is so versatile with so many user choices for each button.  Apple has never, ever made a great mouse, let alone a good one, so I am happy to be able to say that this Microsoft mouse is the best I have ever used.  It holds up well to heavy use load.  It is especially comfortable for men who have larger hands.So, don't be afraid to buy this mouse just because it has a Microsoft label on it.  Contrary to popular opinion, not all Microsoft products are clunky, require white lab coat techies to make it work right, are difficult to use, require high level of technical skills, and show little regard for the user when design work was being done.  Microsoft really delivered the quality and functionality that Apple zealots take for granted.  Try it, you will like it.Oh, BTW, it's a USB mouse, so it works great on any Macintosh product.  Now, if Microsoft would just make it in a pretty Apple white color.My written review was also meant to test your sense of humor.  Smiling is permitted!  :-))", "\"The title says it all. I've been using this mouse on my #2 computer for the last 2 years, & while I'm only on this pc a few hours a week, I've never regretted the purchase. I just got a new top of the line Logitech mouse yesterday for my main computer, & the fact is this inexpensive mouse is a much better fit for my hand.This is actually the only Microsoft Mouse I've ever owned. I may take a look at some of their higher end models to replace the Logitech \"\"Performance\"\" which I really don't like.Edit 5/25/12: I just bought my 2nd one today to replace yet another dead Logitech. I've been heavily into computing since 1998, & from both price/performance ratio & reliability standpoints this is the best mouse I've ever owned.Edit 9/12/12: I'm now using this mouse on my 2 main computers, despite also owning a top of the line Logitech Performance Mouse. That's how much I like it.\"", "When my previous mouse started to give me problems, I chose this mouse.It is simple to use, with very smooth operation.Like its name, it is comfortable to use too. The controls are simple.I also like the look of it, I was looking at a very flashy red model, then decided on this one instead, as it's very reasonably priced.I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone replacing their mouse.", "I know things don't last forever, and I have bought this same mouse 2 times in several years.  I get about 2-3 years before something goes wrong with it.  I don't complain.  While they work, they just work pretty well.  Sometimes the wheel gets hard to turn after a while or gets sloppy. But like I said, about 2 years. I think they are one of the more comfortable ones available for the price.", "So I bought 10 for the office, and I broke 2 of it within a year already because of the right click doesn't response... it clicks but it just doesn't register to the computer.I will stay away from it.", "This does everything I needed it to do, including not get lost.  Somewhere I have a wireless mouse.....  somewhere....  This is always attached to my computer and so it is easy to find.", "I changed to this mouse because my SideWinder X5 Mouse right click button stopped working good.  I got this because of the price and reviews.  It fits almost perfectly in my hand and I have a normal sized man's hand.  The buttons click nicely and the smooth scroll is exactly that, smooth.  The sideway scrolling is excellent.  The zoom click button works awesome, you just click it and it zooms in on the spot you zoomed.  But for the price and comfort of this mouse, you just cannot go wrong.", "\"I purchased quite a few of these to use as mice replacements for my office users. They're much higher quality than the mice that have been shipping with our Dell systems of late.The ergonomics is agreeable for most user, the buttons have continued to function well and the wide scroll wheel is easy to reach, turn and spins more freely than most models on the market - meaning you can get more scroll out of one \"\"flick\"\" - a good thing for scanning pages quickly.This certainly doesn't have the flash of some of the newest models, but for the price I don't think you will be disappointed.\"", "I've had this mouse for years and it's the first one (and only one so far) that has felt comfortable in my hand.  I have small hands.  But the other thing about this mouse is that it's not as TALL as some of the others.  I now have a laptop on a small, crampy desk, and hubby bought me the MS Wireless mouse 3000 to replace this so I wouldn't have to worry about the cables getting in my way.  But the wireless one is higher, so my wrist cramps up while using it.  I'm back to the wired 3000 for now, and going to stores today to see if I can find a comparable sized/shaped wireless mouse.  But if not, I'll get another one of these, because this one's starting to wear out (the cord is getting loose at the mouse end) after several years.", "First I'd like to say that I'm not a big fan of Microsoft products as of late given their quality. However, this mouse is a big exception to the rule. In my opinion this is actually better than Apple's Mighty Mouse.Pros1) you get real tactile feedback for all the buttonS2) you can scroll vertically AND horizontally3) decent ergonomics and trackingCons1) the scroll wheel button takes some time getting used to ( I couldn't work it properly until a day or two). Compared to other Microsoft mice I've had over the years, there's something slight off in the Comfort 3000's scroll wheel button (3rd mouse button). It only works if you click on it from a specific angle. This may have something to do with the side scrolling feature2) the scroll wheel is not as fluid as other scroll wheels from other mice.Again his may have something to do with the side scrolling feature. You can compensate for this by adjusting mouse options...3) horizontal scrolling speed is even more horrible than vertical scrolling speed.Overall I think this is still a great product", "I bought this mouse two years ago and it still pretty functional. It is not perfect gaming mouse but it does its job very well. Recommend for is durability.", "This mouse is very responsive and has a nice shape the fits into my hand.  I really like the 'back' button that I use with my thumb, and the wheel is quiet and easy to roll.  There aren't any flaws, unless you don't like the slightly larger than average size.", "Works fine on my Sony laptop. Didn't have to do any software -- it just works.  Fits your hand just right and moves easily.", "\"In March 2005 I bought an Apple G5 and nearly two years later the only thing I can say that was cheap about it was the mouse: no right-click and the clicking for cutting and pasting on my website stopped working. Additionally, it started to make a creaking sound, another sign of cheapness.I didn't want to spend 50 bucks on the \"\"Mighty Mouse\"\" so I took a chance on the Microsoft 3000 at half the price. Following the instructions, I did not put the Microsoft 3000 mouse into my USB port until AFTER I downloaded the included software, which took 5 minutes or so. The results have been excellent. More mouse comfort, easier gliding motion, right click function, magnification function. The 3000 has proven to be a more than worthy upgrade for my iMac G5.\"", "I got this mouse with the purchase of a keyboard. It has many good features. For example, they design of the mouse is basic, but comfortable. It is designed to be ambidextrous, so that anyone can use it. The buttons are integrated into the mouse, so there is a very seamless look to it. Because of the two handed design, you won't get the form-fitting design that you would get with other mice, but it is a compromise.The magnifier button is a great feature for people who are vision impared like me. You click the button, and you can get to access a magnifing function that creates an enlarged space on the screen where the mouse pointer is. This will be hard to use properly if you are left-handed, because of the placement on the left side of the mouse.The mouse is very light, which can be both a plus or a minus. I don't have a preference, but it may be just a bit too plasticky for some users. The wheel is a bit too hard to click. It really doesn't need to be that hard to push down on. The tilt-wheel function is okay, though with a little tinkering it can get better.Overall, I think that this is a relatively comfortable mouse. It won't knock your socks off, but if you want a little extra for your computing needs, it won't hurt to try it.", "cheap but it makes its job, good for First Person shooter games, really precise, and great when using a sniper", "It's a mouse....it works.  Nothing super for my old hands, but I've had no problems with it.  From Windows 7 to 8.1, it works well.", "Smooth scrolling feels good for browsing, For a large mouse, it really is comfortable. Extra side button for those of you used to 3 button mice. Smooth movement for a cheaper mouse, Still works after over a year of use. A great buy.", "I use this mouse mainly for gaming - response is perfect and smooth... however before this mouse I had a smaller one, so it took some time to get used to when i got this mouse... like everyone else here states; the issues about the mouse wheel is true... but after about a month everything feels great now.
