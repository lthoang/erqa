Overall, it takes really nice, SHARP images throughout the zoom range. It's a bit on the heavy side from what I'm used to however, the camera feels well-balanced so that makes up for its weight.The lens is not actually manufactured by Leica in Germany. The lens is designed by Leica but manufacturered in Japan of Japanese glass and components to Leica specifications.Problems:PURPLE FRINGE: This camera exhibits purple fringe in high contrast images. I also found green fringe in some of my images too. But alas, these problems are mostly solved in Photoshop or by using a Hot Mirror filter.NOISE: This camera displays a lot of noise especially in darker images and at ISO settings above 200 or even 100 in some cases. I don't care for any of the current noise reduction programs, they only seem to blur the image in an attempt to reduce noise so I don't use the camera above ISO 100. Sort of pityful that Panasonic would match such a great camera and lens with such a mediocre sensor and processing engine. Maybe a firmware update is hopefully in the works for this camera which might help? Shooting in RAW mode seems to help a bit with the noise, making it look more like old fashioned grainy film.  There's also some clipping that occurs in the RBG color gamut, again in darker images mostly.  The dynamic range of the camera is a bit less than most other cameras which would explain the clipping.Overall, it's a great camera thanks to the lens, but it has limitations.  If you learn to work within the limitations of the camera, the images it will produce are stunning.", "\"I ran across one of these in good condition and at a very low price and so picked it up.  It is an excellent camera.  The zoom ring and manual focus ring are superb.  Also, the quick \"\"AF Macro\"\" switch on the lens is a great feature.  I do a lot of macro shots and this camera is excellent at that.  It's also an excellent 12x zoom everyday camera.  A bit big and heavy by today's standards, but I like that, more stable.  And I use SLR's a lot, so it feels better to me.I also love the EVF, the great controls, and the rich feature set.  I have a fair number of different cameras and this is one of my current favorites.  I love picking up a classic at a bargain price!If you run across one of these, I highly recommend it.  I never even cracked the manual, just picked it up and started shooting.  Everything is pretty intuitive as far as the controls.  I prefer a view finder for composition, so I use the EVF a lot and it's decent.  I can focus manually accurately and with the diopter adjusted can use this without my glasses very well.  It also has a very strong flash unit built in and overall image quality is very good.This would be an excellent \"\"starter\"\" camera for someone getting serious about photography as it has all the manual controls, including that excellent manual focus ring, and settings.  Much better in some ways than many of the newer cameras you might consider. A great value if you find one in good shape.  Highly recommended.\"", "I'm a pro, working for a large city daily newspaper for 22 years, and shooting professionaly for 25 years (and counting, with enthusiasm for the job). My previous cameras: Sears 500MX (my first SLR), Nikon EM, F2A, FM2, F3, F4, F5 ( all film)... And then the Kodak DCS, Nikon D1, D1H, D2H, Lumix FZ20 (all digital). I've shot events such as Superbowl XXXV (D1H), 2004 Olympics, 2005 Indonesian tsunami (D2H), and Hurricane Katrina (D2H, Lumix FZ20).But I was issued an FZ30 by request, after using an FZ20 so I could finally zoom while shooting video (for web content). You know why I also like the FZ30? You can shoot Tiger Woods' back swing without him throwing a club at you, which he'd be right to do if you sat on a motor as he started his swing.The FZ30 is much heavier than many of the average cameras on sale. It looks pro and feels heavy enough. The shutter speed range is even greater than the FZ20, capturing pictures at 1/2000th sec to a full 60 seconds (the D2H has only 30 seconds exposure maximum. Other pro shooters have noticed my camera, and ask plenty of questions. It does just about everything, including an option to create animated films with this camera. But it's not the ultimate dream camera because it isn't perfect.I totally shame the digital noise on this unit; enough decent cameras in the same price range don't experience the higher levels of noise, even for ISO 100. But I work for a newspaper.... and there is some decent noise-reduction software to control it that doesn't compromise flirting with over-manipulation ethics questions. I can now shoot some concerts and can shoot golf differently b/c I turned off the shutter and beep noises the camera makes.I wish the camera had a wider wide angle. The zoom and focus controls seem too close. And the rear thumb dial seemed a tiny bit out of position at times. It's quiet as a mouse. People don't even know you're shooting video, which makes people unaware of you, an important thing to have for candid news-gathering. I love the FZ30 as a 3rd camera in my arsenal. I just completed a stint, shooting the crew of Pride of Baltimore II, a tall ship. It worked wonders, save for some errant focusing every now and then.I pack my Lumix and my Powerbook along with my passport when I go on vacation; in a pinch, I can travel worldwide and shoot virtually any assignment, including spot news, with the zoom range that the FZ30 has. That was the selling point for me. Any camera that has a decent image quality with a 12:1 zoom ratio and a lens that gathers more light is worth considering. And I love the true colors it can yield for white balance, one thing that my D2H bodies can sometimes find difficult to achieve.This camera is better suited for daylight (sorry for anyone Alaska in the winter!), but you can get amazing shots if you respect a camera's limits. The better the light, the better the image. That goes for any photography. I can shoot 99 percent of my assignments with this camera.Watch out when you have the LCD screen flipped out; once it breaks off from a hit, I would think you might have to consider replacement. Purchase a really big memory card, which are cheaper. A faster one (SD rated card) for those who want to shoot video, which you can opt between low definition and VGA, which is a good size image (it only shoots in standard TV size. You don't have any option to capture video in any other format, as you can with film.You can also crop your images or even downsize them for web emails in the camera. The FZ30 feels solid enough. And I did drop my lens shade from 50 feet (it was mounted, but the mount is not very secure) and it bounced but didn't crack.Make certain to also purchase at least one extra battery, because if your power drains, you either pop in a fresh one, or stop shooting and wait over an hour for your battery to recharge. The batteries from my FZ20 can fit and run the FZ30, but the reverse can't be done.Please, read the manual. This camera was well-designed, and Panasonic seems to really work on their cameras based on feedback. You have menus in several different camera modes, besides the basic setup menu options. One thing very interesting is that you can set the camera to extend its optical zoom to 19.1, much greater than 12X (the camera actually begins to crop into the frame when you zoom past the full frame 12X maximum zoom, which is good if you want to save a step in image processing.", "\"There is lot to like about this camera. The build quality is very nice and the optical capability is exceptional. In particular I really liked how it fit in my hand.  The controls are very logically placed as well.  Another thing I have noticed is that in retrospect  the use of this camera and the familiarity with it's control and options layout  gave me an advantage when moving on to an advanced DSLR system.  The many hours spent using this camera gave me a leg up in understanding the features and interface offered in a professional quality system.The camera sure was a lot of fun too!  A lot of zoom range and features packaged in a relatively discrete sized camera. It takes several thousand dollars in lenses to equal the zoom range this camera gave me.My previous review expressed the frusteration I experienced when dealing with Panasonics cutomer service and website.  Seeing as it has been many months since I would give Panasonic the benefit of the doubt and assume that some improvements to service after the sale must have been made.Overall when looking back I think that the FZ20 and FZ30 will be remembered as very significant cameras in regards to the \"\"digital revolution\"\".  At least they were for me!Good luck!Previous review.....Excellent camera in many respects!Very comfortable to hold and intuitive to use.The Leica 12x optical lense plus digital zoom allows this to be a versatile  and fun camera.Plenty of  imaging options make it possible to capture almost any situation.The color quality and sharpness are outstanding.This camera has so much going for it.But  where it fails to sustain expectations and  eventually fails to deliver as promised is  when you need information , support , accessories  and most glaringly when implementing RAW capture.Panasonic  offers accesssories for this camera  and it's predecessors that  can't be in fact be ordered and as far as I know after months of looking are nowhere to be found.After  several months of trying I have yet to be able to import and process any images taken in RAW format.Trying to get an answer or for that matter, even ask a question regarding any of these issues has to be the the most frusterating experience I've ever had as a consumer.  Attempting to contact , inquire, assert or find answers to anything other than  buying equipment  almost seems  intentionally set up to discourage the user.Still sitting here, another day of  searching for any information at all with regards to processing their RAW files really detracts from what otherwise would be my vote for top value in a digital camera.None of the well known imaging software that I have nor the software and plugin's that come with my almost four thousand dollars worth ofcutting edge computer  and related products  is able to process it so far.What the answer is I guess Panasonic isn't telling.Wish I would have known  the real capability is in reality , very close toit's predecesser the FZ20.Something to think about before you \"\"upgrade\"\"!\"", "I ordered the FZ30 based on the excellence of the FZ20, which I absolutely love.  The zoom is fantastic for portraits and glamour, and the macro flower pictures are marvelous, but only 5 Mp.  I needed more Mp to go with my CS2 program, and attempt to return to semi-pro photography.  I received the camera fine, the price was very good, and though the 30 is a bit heavier than the 20, the same features endear me to it.  And not having the lens physically extend (I bought the lens protector cylinder for the 20) is a plus.  Everything went well until I went onto the Panasonic site and registered.  I looked for a spare battery (anyone who uses digital knows to get a spare!), and the battery number brought no results.  I even looked on Amazon, and no listing for the battery number in the manual.  Though the camera is excellent for advanced journeyman and even entry-level pro, not being able to find a backup battery caused me to give only 4 stars.  Oversight?  Until there's a listing for the required battery (different from the 20), or some kind of a conversion list (if they changed numbers), I can't give it 5 stars.  And the local stores only carry Panasonic batteries for the compact cameras.", "For my purposes, I do not need a digital SLR and all the work that goes i9nto one- I'll never be that good a photographer.  Really don't need all this has to offer either, but it's fun to play with and see how it can make impossible shots come out.Earlier this summer I decided to get an upgraded point nad shoot, so I'm comparing this camera to a Nikon Coolpix P80 that I like a lot.  But in some ways this just seems to take better pictures.  The one feature I like most is the ring focus instead of the motorized zoom (don't even know if I'm using the right term for this).The one thing I like better on the Nikon is the memory card capability- have an 8GB in that, the DMC supposedly only takes a 2GB, so I have to live with 500 pictures.So, I'm happy taking MUCH better pictures with both and comparing them and getting to know which does what best.Finally, I'll say once again I don't do specs, leave it on auto most of the time and take the memory cards to Shoprite for instant developing, don 'tu s e the computer, don't leave film in 35mm for a year anymore, so I now have photo albums filled with excellent pictures", "Update: Now 2014 and although I've since purchased newer cameras I still use this Panasonic. It's my back-up and still as reliable as the first day I used it. It's an excellent camera and I wholeheartedly, without reservations, recommend it.Yes, I exclaimed Wow! This camera is great. I've had it a week (It's now been months, and this camera still rules) and, frankly, I'm still trying to figure out half of the bells and whistles it comes with (I'm getting them down pat, and love the results). I'm coming off of an Olympus 3.2 mp and I can't get over the fact that this camera comes from Panasonic. The 12x zoom in incomparable. Picture quality is excellent. I recently used it at an indoor affair and it performed perfectly with and w/o the built in flash. Used it for some really close ups of flora while kayaking and still can't believe the quality of the photos (excellent results no matter the subject). I haven't come across anything negative and I've been giving it a workout. Good job Panasonic, thanks. And for the money this camera is a true bargain."], "Gamma": [0.36725878715515137, 0.2654768228530884, 0.36726438999176025], "Beta": [[0.31330645084381104, 0.008383222855627537, 0.00029300726600922644, 0.0025441076140850782, 0.002742459299042821, 0.00028602356906048954, 0.6724446415901184], [0.316883385181427, 0.009079855866730213, 0.0003223064704798162, 0.002794991247355938, 0.0028799581341445446, 0.0003144620277453214, 0.6677250862121582], [0.31331923604011536, 0.008381659165024757, 0.0002932041825260967, 0.002543211216107011, 0.0027425966691225767, 0.00028604004182852805, 0.6724340319633484]]}
