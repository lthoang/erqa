It thinks outside the box, it's different from all other games, you are never given a weapon; instead it requires a lot of thought and quick reflexes, and it's the only game that actually qualifies as a game of drama.WHAT THE GAME IS: Well, it qualifies as an adventure game, but you can't exactly pigeonhole it into what kind of game it is, it's that unique. It's January 2009, in New York City, a series of murders involving ordinary people who kill total strangers in public places is occurring. There is no connection between these murders other than they all follow the same ritualistic killing methods. One of the protagonists in a game; Lucas Kane; becomes the latest person to kill someone in a public place. For no apparent reason, Lucas kills a man in the bathroom of a restaurant, so he must avoid capture from the police. The story also stars two police detectives; Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles; who are working on the case and they are playable characters as well. The game is all about quick reflexes and strategically (not to mention frantically) carrying out your actions and choosing what the characters say during a conversation.GRAPHICS: These graphics don't look that great, even for when it was released in 2005. The textures are lousy and the animation is stiff.MUSIC: It's good and it sets the drama mood as well as for the frantic moments of gameplay.SOUNDS: Mostly just talking.GAMEPLAY: Okay, let's just get the bad part out of the way, the controls are awful and are very difficult to get used to. The gameplay relies almost exclusively on the analog sticks, I'm not kidding. Almost all the movements and actions are done via analog sticks. But once you get the hang of the controls, the game turns out to be quite an entertaining piece of work. There are no guns, no weapons of any kind. The gameplay revolves around the everyday lives of Lucas and the two detectives. Whether it be relationship problems, going to work, working on the computer, analyzing evidence and crimes, drowning your sorrows in alcohol or drugs, saving people from drowning, hiding evidence, having strange visions, engaging in conversation, opening things, listening to music, playing guitar,  and avoiding becoming an emotional wreck this drama title has got all of this and more. It requires a lot of use from your brain, so if you only like the old Xbox for shooters, you won't like this game because it has no weapons.OVERALL: If you like games that are out of the ordinary, this game is definitely worth a look if you please. But be warned about the controls and camera problems. I wish developer Quantic Dream had spent more time fine-tuning the controls, but what's here is just fine and quite entertaining. I honestly would be more than willing to play Quantic Dream's upcoming Heavy Rain, but the question is, when does it come out, and will it go multi-platform (So far it has only been announced for PS3)?THE GOOD: A game that is surprisingly smart, inventive, innovative, and quite interesting as a drama game.THE BAD: Awful controls and squirelly camera.", "\"Can this really be considered a game?Indigo Prophecy is a movie.  It says so right in the main title screen.  Fortunately, it was made in video game form because I don't think it would've done too well on the big screen.  However, as a video game, it makes for a great dramatic presentation.  The characters are believable, the voice talent is some of the best I've heard in a while, and the story is simply gripping.  As I was playing, I truly felt for the characters in the story, especially the ones you control.  The game sort of plays out like the sims (without the action sequences of course).  You control your character and pretty much have free will as to where they go and what they interact with.  Unlike the sims, however, your story will eventually end the same every time.That being said, this game isn't really that fun as a \"\"game.\"\"  The action sequences and question choices seem more like a tedious task than enthralling gameplay.  In fact, it's the game's biggest downfall.  I can overlook the character graphical detail and the mouth movement that is worse than a Neversoft game, but I can't overlook the fact that the action sequences where I am forced to \"\"DDR\"\" with my joysticks or repeatedly pull the left and right triggers seem so unnecessary and unexciting.  Plain and simple, this game is not fun.  It has a great stroy, one of the best in a while...but it fails as a game because the gameplay is horiffic.  I wish that I felt like I was controlling the character (which, as the creator says in the tutorial, is the idea), but I just feel like I'd rather do it myself than being rewarded for \"\"bopping it\"\" correctly.Rent it.\"", "\"Indigo Prophecy deserves kudos for thinking outside of the box. This merges an adventure game, a thrilling crime drama and reflex action together. Unfortunately, the results are a bit sporatic.First, the basics. You are an innocent man - but somehow you wake up standing over a dead body, knife in hand. Obviously you killed him - but why? You're not the only person asking this question. You can switch between three other characters in order to solve this crime.The game is a \"\"movie\"\". The tutorial takes place in a green room situation where you learn how to move and interact. There are flashbacks, thought-overs, foreshadowing and many other movie gimmicks. If you love movies, this is great. It helps to immerse you in the feeling that you are interacting in an epic situation.There is a lot of dialogue here, and you lead it along. You have a series of options you can choose from, and depending on what direction you choose to go in, the storyline follows you. In that sense, the game is really quite open and you can have a great impact on what happens.All of these situations are great in theory. The practice is a bit different.For starters, the game's graphics are really not that wonderful. I realize that in many games it doesn't matter - but this is supposed to be a gritty crime drama. With all the amazing XBox games out there, to then go \"\"backwards\"\" to this one is quite noticeable. It detracts from gameplay to have pixellated objects to interact with when you're talking about human lives on the line.The game, for all of its freedom of choice, is very linear. It starts right from the beginning. You're in your apartment, evading the cops. You want to hide a bloody item of clothing and do up the bed. But wait - you can't pull out your blankets if you're holding something in your hand! You can't put that item down either. So you have to run across the room to the washing machine - put it in - then run back to the bed and pull that across. They have a set order they expect you to do things in. If you don't, you keep failing and restarting until you get it right.The movement makes this doubly difficult. You enter a room and forward is up. Go into another room and forward is left. The cameras don't follow with you naturally. It adds extra frustration to the constant restart cycle.The game design is very innovative. Again, I praise them for thinking outside the box and creating this rich, dramatic environment. However, they should have spent a few more months in testing and design, so that the rest of the game was brought up to those same standards.Don't get me started on the left-left-right-up-right sequences required in order to do certain tasks ...Note: this does play on the XBox 360.\"", "I bought the Xbox version of Indigo Prophecy simply because the machine doesn't get all that much use.  I prefer adventure/rpg games and they are scarce for the Xbox, to say the least.  Unfortunately, the game was clearly written for the PS2 and then ported to the Xbox with little thought about gameplay.  This time Atari took a good game and definitely did not make it better.Let's do the good parts first, since Indigo Prophecy really is a good game on many levels.  The game's inner story is based on an actual legend associated with the change of Mayan eras.  Into this new era is supposed to be born an 'indigo' child who will come with a prophecy that will grant great power to those who would listen.  Add in a lot of human sacrifice and a dollop of paranoid plot to take over not just the world, but the universe, and you have Indigo Prophecy in a nutshell.Oracles use randomly chosen instruments to carry out sacrifices, and this is the story of Lucas Kane, who suddenly finds himself a murderer and must elude both the police and assassins from a secret clan long enough to find out what happened to him and why he suddenly has strange powers.  Pther key characters are Lucas' brother Marcus, and two police investigators, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles.  The player get's to control all of these characters, often in the same episode.  The story is good, and the modern noir settings and sound are as well.  Where this game runs into trouble is in the action game play and artwork.Action is managed by to different operations, either following directional sequences displayed on the screen, or in rapid toggling of the two trigger keys.  On any of the typical Xbox controllers these operations are more irritating than challenging.  Accomplishing significant parts of this game involve being totally focus on the few square inches of screen where the progress of the challenge is displayed.  So there you are in the middle of an action sequence and you can actually miss most of the action.  It wasn't until I happened to look at my PS2 controller that I realized all this activity would have been much smoother if I had played the PS2 version of the game.Artwork is low detail even for a PS2 based game, and looks even weaker on an Xbox.  This is odd, considering that there isn't a lot of intricate action to eat up computer time that could have been dedicated to graphics.  Atari chose to make this game on a slim budget, and the story, while strong, isn't enough to make this a real winner.Overall, this is a three and a half star game on the Xbox, but a solid 4 on the PS2.  Good entertainment, but not particularly memorable.", "\"Indigo Prophecy is a game like no other.  It truly gives the feeling that you are playing a moving instead of a video game.  Your decisions will alter the outcome of the game and often they can lead to your demise.  The graphics of the game are excellent.  The controls are simple to use but there's a tutorial to train you on the basic moves if needed.  The storyline is original and engrossing, the voice work is about as good as you'll find in any game.  This is more of a RPG than a standard action game.  You won't get into battles head on, but rather you will play a series of \"\"simon says\"\" sequences that you can pass or fail depending on your dexterity.  There is a flaw with this type of combat system in that the guide shows up on the screen and you are so focused on trying to master the moves that you miss what is actually going on in the game.You'll play as different characters, the lead, a presumed murderer and the cops that are tracking you down.  This adds interest to the game as you will diligently try to escape the cops one minute and the next you are desperately looking for clues to try to catch the character that you just played.  Throughout the game,  you'll have to make decisions: conversation topics, actions, etc.  For the most part, each decision alters the game outcome so you have to think about what could happen in the long run but you will only have a limited amount of time to do so.  The game plays like a movie and unlike most games, the cut scenes are not transitions into the next chapter but are actually the game itself.  Indigo Prophecy is a bit short, however there is significant replay value as making different decisions can completely change the outcome of the game.  It is obvious that there was a great deal of time and thought put into the development of this game and it clearly shows.  This is one of the most original, clever games created for any platform.  Give this one a try.\"", "\"The Good: Excellent storytelling, voice acting, and fun and interesting mini-gamesThe Bad: Extremely short, hideous graphics, not much incentive for a second play throughGames these days lack much of a story and thankfully Indigo Prophecy takes up some of that slack. about 80% of Indigo Prophecy is just storytelling with excellent voice acting. The majority of the game has you walking around places looking for clues to solve simple puzzles. This is done with thumb stick moving so it makes you feel like you're \"\"really picking objects up\"\". A good example is when you have to sit down: you just push the right thumb stick down (an icon will appear on the top of the screen to show what you are going to do and what moving to make). The other half of the game is made up of mini-games with timed thumb stick moving (think of Simon Says) and L+R alternations...yeah it doesn't sound exciting but it really works and these ideas are implemented well with the ideas attached to them.On the story side it's very complex and well executed. You play as Lucas Kane who is convicted for a murder he didn't commit. You play as the 2 cops investigating the crime as well. The whole purpose of the game is the idea of playing chess against yourself. You can decide how the game is played out and actions you make early on will effect things later on. You really notice this too because later on you'll say \"\"Oh man I shouldn't have done that earlier!\"\" The game's pace flows smoothly and everything eventually comes together.Between each scene in the game you can choose which character you'll play next and this also determines the outcome. Some parts are also timed so you have a certain amount of time to hide, collect and hide evidence. If you miss one piece of evidence and someone comes to ask you questions they'll see it and get suspicious. This in turn raises their suspicion meter and you must make the right choices so you don't get busted. You also have a mental health gauge which lets you know how your character is feeling. Your choices will determine whether or not they become happier or more and more depressed leaning on suicide. You can do things from going to the bathroom, to drinking something, to even just make the right choice in a conversation to raise or lower this gauge. This plays a key part in certain scenes because some choices will completely drain your meter so you end up turning yourself in. The game is constantly changing from Lucas' childhood flashbacks, and the 3 separate characters keep things interesting.Thankfully you can beat the game in about 6-8 hours so you won't get too bored with these concepts. For the short time they work well and will keep you hooked until the very end. The great storytelling and excellent voice acting keep you hooked. Now a huge downside is the game is hideous. The animations are stiff and the textures are flat, dull, muddy, and just down right ugly. The game looks like a PS2 launch title that's how bad it looks. I played the PS2 version back when it came out and that version had some slowdown, but the Xbox version is just as ugly. There are some extras here such as making of videos, galleries, and a soundtrack (which is really good). You can unlock these by finding bonus cards in the game, but don't worry one play through and you'll get more points than you need to unlock everything. I highly suggest IP if you really want a good story. I also suggest picking this up at a game store because you can get it for less than $10 now!!! Xbox Originals charges you $15 so be warned!!\"", "There have been games throughout the years that have truly done something original, different and completely engaging.  It always seems to be that these games fall by the wayside in terms of popularity which is a shame.  Indigo Prophecy falls into this category as an original game with a fantastic premise and incredibly exciting gameplay.Never before have I played a game that was so interactive in its story-telling.  When trying to describe this game, I would point to God of War, a PS2 game in which there were scenes where you have timed button presses that would move forward a cutscene.  It helped bring you into the story, the cutscenes so that it was you that were doing all of the cool acrobatic manuevers killing the hydra.  Another game that used this to a lesser effect was Resident Evil 4, for example with the knife fight that you had to push buttons to keep Leon safe.  Indigo Prophecy takes this idea and pushes it to the extreme.IP is basically and incredibly interactive movie.  It mixes the adventure genre, which is seldom seen on console, and movies and melds them into a cohesive and incredibly engaging story.  It starts off with a bang as you immediately find yourself killing someone you don't know in a diner.  You feel like you're not in control of your actions and as a result you have a body in a restroom and a policeman drinking coffee in the restaurant.  What do you do?  You're free to act from here on out.  Do you leave the body and rush out?  Do you hide the body?  What about the blood?  What about the blood on you?  What about the knife?  When you leave do you pay your bill?  You can take care of all or none of the options above.  And the story will be different, sometimes marginally sometimes drastically.  Oh, and by the way, that cop sitting outside needs to use the restroom and soon the screen will split and you better be out of there before he makes it to the restroom.This opening sequence exemplifies everything this game is about.  Choices, story and gameplay all merged into one.  But innovation doesn't end there.  As soon as Lucas (the murdering protagonist) is free of the diner, you take control of two police detectives who investigate the scene.  You can switch between the two on the fly and you have to find clues, make theories and basically do everything in your power to catch Lucas.  Its this give and take gameplay, where you have to play one side against the other, that truly gives the game a sense of urgency and excitement.Going back to the God of War example, when you have cutscenes in this game, you better not put your controller down.  Gameplay pushes forward the story-centered bits as well.  Whether its doing a simon says type control scheme to manuever your character past cars that are hurtling toward him, alternating between the L and R trigger as fast as you can to save someone who's drowning or using the R stick to make dialogue choices on the fly (you're timed) to hear all you can, the game makes sure to bring you into the story.  Its very effective and really ratchets up the tension.If there is one sore spot in the game its the graphics.  While not bad, exactly, they don't necessarily push the Xbox in the way that this last year of Xbox life should.  It looks like a first or possibly second generation Xbox game.  Artistically the game is good.  The characters in the cutscenes move really well and realistically.  And there is never a moment of lag or skipping seen in a lot of games today.  The character's faces have some nice emotion to them and the graphics aren't stellar, like I said, but they do a decent job.  There's a ton of aliasing, however, which is sad.Another sore spot is the controls.  When you are in direct control of your character (i.e. actually moving them as opposed to having control of the cutscenes via button pressing) the game is pretty loose.  It reminds me of playing the old Resident Evil games.  You have the cinematic camera which causes some confusion as to which direction you should push your character.  As a result, you will do a lot of figure 8s in the game which can cause a lot of problems when you have to hide the evidence because a cop is at your door and the timer is going down.  Character animation while moving is also very stiff and a big difference from the cut scene animation.The audio is terrific, however.  While the box says the game does not run in 5.1 in game, I think it lies.  My receiver lights up whenever 5.1 is being used and its always lit with this game.  And it sounds like 5.1 is being used.  The voice acting is absolutely wonderful and professional.  Each voice matches the character and it helps enhance this feeling of playing a murder mystery movie.  With voice acting becoming so important in games today, this is most welcome and really helps sell the game.  Musically, the game also excels by using the very talented Angelo Badalamenti to score it.  That name might not mean much on the outset but he has created scores to many Hollywood movies including most by David Lynch (Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., Twin Peaks) but also Dark Water, Arlington Road, etc.  The score is absolutely beautiful and moving; it really fits in with what is happening on screen.What this game does best is meld the story-telling of a movie with the gameplay of video games.  It exposes the limitations of both and yet uses the best of both to create an engaging, moving and very interactive story.  For me, this game is a perfect building block for video games.  I can overlook most of its flaws because it is so different, so exciting and so damn cool.  It warrants a 5 star review simply because of what it did.  I would most heartedly recommend this game to those who love a good story, like action adventure games and want to be impressed with what video games and movies can accomplish together.", "\"I've beat this game twice already, and still love the game. You can approach the game from quite a few different levels and do different things.But overall, this game has an amazing storyline and plot. It keeps you hooked, because you see what happened, then you just have to keep playing because you want to see what happens next in the story. Thats the good thing. The graphics are pretty good. I didnt see no flaws in them. The controls, can be a pain SOMETIMES, but hardly ever. The sound in the game, very good. The sound fits the theme of the game perfectly. Very good on that part.The game is REALLY fun, the simon says sequences, get you more into the game and the scene thats happening. And talking to people is also fun, when you talk to them you usually have a couple different answers you can answer to their questions. Which sort of reminds me of my favorite game, \"\"Shenmue\"\". But this game is VERY good, and should not be passed up by any gamer.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1789121776819229, 0.11905936896800995, 0.1572677344083786, 0.024622531607747078, 0.10560717433691025, 0.00880772341042757, 0.2501731812953949, 0.15555009245872498]]}
