When GTA:2 came out, it had very similar reviews: mixed ones. However, when GTA:3 came out for the PS2 about 5 years ago, everything changed. The game got between 8-10 ratings everywhere. ( Mostly 9-10 ) The GTA series had gone full 3D and made for an extremely fun title to play. Vice City also came out about 2 years later, and it also got rave reviews. San Andreas came out not too long ago and got great reviews, too. But now, Rockstar has decided to put GTA on the PSP, and it is a great game. It takes GTA 3, and puts it on a handheld; the WHOLE game.This game is different than GTA 3 because it has an entirely different story. You play as Toni Cipriani who was forced into hiding after killing a \"\"made man\"\", but now in LCS you get to take him and make things right. The story line is a pretty good one so far, full of great voice acting.Pros: City looks nearly the same as GTA 3, very similar controls as PS2 versions of the GTA series, unbelievable graphics for a handheld, nice voice acting, great sound and radio stations, awesome!!Cons: When going gast in a vehicle and crashing, game pauses temporarily, Many may have wanted a different city, choppy OCCASIONALLY, graphical blurs, hard missions at beginning of game. ( For instance, you with fists against 5 or more guys with guns. )Graphics: 9.5/10. This is a handheld, Remember that, and the graphics are un..be..li..evable. The game looks just as good ) if not better ) than GTA 3, and it's dandy!Sound: 9/10. Radio stations are back, my personal favorite? Chatterbox. Still a great station with better humor than GTA 3 at times. Voice acting is superb, too. Cars sound great, guns sound great, everything does.Control: 9/10. Easy to get used to for sure. Very similar to GTA's for the PS2... not much more to say.Fun: 9/10. Multiplayer? Haven't played it yet, but I've heard it's \"\"addicting\"\" and it's \"\"hard to stop playing it during class\"\". You can't swim or clib things like in San Andreas, but there are now motorcycles and stuff in Liberty City Stories, as well as new cars, and of course the new story line. If you are a fan of GTA, I don't have to tell you what to do with this game.\"", "Amazing job by Rockstar of porting this title, bet they are let down by the very poort design of the PSP which was built to run games from the mid 80s.  How Sony could release a handheld with only one analog stick (and a lousy nub at that) is beyond me.  They can correct this horrendous design flaw (which is the big reason why not one great game has been made for the system), by coming out with an add-on, that plugs into the usb port, and adds an additonal analog stick.  Even better would be an add on that adds two analog sticks so the nub can be ignored.  It would snap onto the PSP and should be very easy to design. Considering how many controllers plug into a usb, this should not be a far fetched idea and would change forever how the PSP plays games.  Plus it would eliminate the obligitory mention of control problems always included in any review.", "I just bought the game yesterday and it really met my expectations. The first thing I saw was the quick loading times. Even though some magazines have stated that the load times are fast, I really didn't believe it. How could an open-ended game have 3-second loading times but, guess what...it does! Everything loads quickly and it doesn't ruin the game. Even Grand Theft Auto series for the PlayStation 2 had long loading times which sometimes were a pain in the neck. Another thing I noticed is the graphics! The graphics are pure amazing and it really looks the same and sometimes even better than it's PS2 counterpart. The framerate is jittery but, the game runs smoothly with almost no hold-up. Especially since this game is open-ended (or as Rockstar atleast says it is) the graphics aren't diminished. You see the clouds and the rain and everything else you are expecting to see. Some of the effects are actually better than Grand Theft Auto: III! The cars are cool and are similar to GTA III but are a little bit older, since the game is set a few years behind #3. Final thing I noticed so far is the depth to the game. The missions aren't easy and shouldn't be which, tells me that Rockstar put a lot of effort making it hard but still fun! You can see the expressions and hear the gunshots which all sound so real. Can you believe though how Rockstar even fit a game like this onto the PSP? I don't know but, they sure have done a good job and this deserves 5-stars. If you think this game isn't as expecting you're wrong because you will be suprised, like I was, on how well manufuctured this game is. You can't put it down and your PSP will be in use 24/7! I love this game so far and I think this is the best game (and savior) for the PSP.", "I was amazed when Grand Theft Auto came out for the Gameboy Advance. It looked and played just like the original PS1 versions of Grand Theft Auto, only in portable form. So, when i heard they were coming out with Liberty City Stories for the PSP, I'll admit..I was a bit skeptical that they'd do a game like GTA3 justice on the handheld(especially after Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition). Yet, after getting Liberty City Stories, I must say I'm simply amazed at what Rockstar did with the game. Load times, which were my biggest concern, were minimal. The game looks and plays like GTA3(and future iterations of it) and, in some ways, one ups it. While it takes place in Liberty City(a town we all are intimately familiar with), the missions and storyline are all new.Multiplayer modes are new and fresh for the series. After three games like this, for the PS2, I thought I'd be burned out playing yet another game but, after playing the handheld version, I became more immersed into the GTA mythos. It being a handheld version added a whole new dimension to things. Sure, controls were a bit odd since there is only one analog stick among a few other lil nitpickey things about the game. Make no mistake, though, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is the Definitive PSP game that everyone should add to their PSP game collection.In my opinion, games on the PSP have been no more than PS1 games with a PS2 graphical shine(not that it's a bad thing)...that is til this game came out. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a game that proves just what the Playstation Portable is truly capable of and is a game that all other PSP games should strive to match. If developers strived to match what Liberty City Stories accomplishes, just think of what type of games we could see on the system. Portable versions of Tony Hawks' American Wasteland, True Crime, Gun, or Call of Duty, perhaps? How about Champions of Norrath, or Final Fantasy? Only time will tell.Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a great addition to the Grand Theft Auto games. Only now in handy 'carry with you' form.", "\"Honestly, this is the best game in the series.  Too bad it isn't multi-platform.  It takes you back to the city you love, \"\"Liberty\"\", only this time...with motorcycles.  The graphics are tight, the controls are the same as always, the radio station material is all-new and hilarious as ever, and the story---Well, that's what makes it the best GTA yet.  Let's face it, \"\"San Andreas\"\" was awful.  No one appreciated that era and that lifestyle except the people that grew up there.\"\"Vice City\"\" was a poor rip-off of \"\"Scarface\"\".\"\"Liberty City Stories\"\" is inventive, clever, and fast-paced.YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME!\"", "\"This is the PSP game we've all been waiting for.Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories lived up to the hype and even surpassed it, and it stands out as one of the biggest and best handheld games I've ever played. What makes it so great?Liberty City Stories is an all-new game in the terms of its story, but that's about it. In fact, one would better describe it as a Grand Theft Auto III.5, as it borrows some gameplay features of GTA: Vice City while taking place in GTAIII's Liberty City. The plot revolves around Tony Cipriani, as some may remember as the owner of St. Mark's Bistro in Liberty City. He's returning to Liberty City after some jail time and his fellow Mafia family wants him to run around LC keeping the Mafia on top of things. Of course, any GTA fan knows that this means driving people around, killing enemies, or both.GTA:LCS does a great job with its story, providing humourous (and fully voice-acted) cut-scenes between each and every mission. There's no doubt that you'll be laughing about some of the events at some point. Unfortunately, the mission design leaves a little to be desired. Like I said, this game is a lot more like GTAIII than, say, GTA: San Andreas. Therefore, San Andy's complex mission structure is left alone to return to a simple, quick approach. This isn't necessarily bad, as some of the missions can be especially difficult on the PSP's 4.3-inch screen.At least the trademark action returns. The simple controls are accompanyed by Vice City's improved targeting system, making the game run smoothly when the action gets hot. Shooting and driving are still the main idea, and they're simple enough to do. The targeting system is done with a trigger button, and eliminating the poor sap is as simple as pressing or holding the circle button. It's as easy as that. Driving feels almost exactly the same as it does on the console, but I did notice that motorcycles are a little tougher to control. The brakes don't seem to be very responsive. Drive-bys are also a little too difficult, as they require the player to hold the camera button, left or right on the analog nub, and the shoot button. By the time you fumble around with this control scheme, you might have already driven past your intended target.Of course, the missions and the story are optional in the mainstream gamer's eyes, and GTA: LCS caters to this. If you were a fan of rampaging around the town, the PSP version delivers. There are more \"\"Past Time\"\" missions like Taxi Driver, Vigilante, and Pizza/Noodle Delivery. These attention-deprived missions are quick and fun, and serve as something extra to do between missions. There are more guns this time around, including most of the ones that were in GTA: Vice City. Having this additional arsenal makes GTA: LCS much more interesting than GTAIII ever was.The graphics sure speak words of their own. I can't believe Rockstar Leeds was able to pull off such a feat as including all of Liberty City in one UMD with space to boot. The load time that starts up the game isn't even a minute long, meaning that LCS is quickly and easily accessible. There is a slight delay inbetween cut-scenes and the start of every mission, but I'm only talking about a ten second load at most. The radio stations return as well. I never really listened to the actual music stations because they feature some really horrible, generic music...but the entertaining precursor to GTAIII's Chatterbox FM, this time called LCFR (Liberty City Free Radio), is endlessly entertaining. The voice acting is spot-on and the sound effects are recycled from other GTA games, making for a well-rounded technical package.Overall, there's no reason why GTA fans or PSP owners should go without this game. I'll let you know that it's pushing the lines on its Mature rating, which is something Rockstar is notoriously comfortable doing. There aren't any Hot Coffee sex scenes, but the crude humor alongside the ridiculously dirty dialogue is enough to keep this game from being something that a child should play. Anyone else...pick this up. You won't be disappointed.\"", "Just got this game and let me say this game is very good so far. 5/5", "\"A lot of times when you buy a new system, you tend to check out the games that are sort of unanimously agreed on as a game to get. After awhile of playing my DS and Wii, I thought I'd give in and get a PSP as well and many games were suggested or looked intriguing but familiarity and a good price brought me to Liberty City Stories. While the content isn't exactly for all ages, LCS shows what exactly Sony's tiny machine can pull off and aside from a few hiccups, this is a great game to check out for recent PSP purchasers or longtime owners - provided you're old enough for this of course.Story: Taking place in 1998, 3 years before the original Grand Theft Auto III, Tony Cipriani as just arrived to Liberty City after laying low from killing a \"\"made man\"\" which is a big mafia no-no. But his absence has left others taking over what he had so Tony has to rise up again in the ranks and take on various tasks to be where he used to be or maybe even further.Graphics: Despite its smaller system, the PSP always looked like it could handle more complex games like God of War or Crisis Core and while graphically LCS doesn't impress on a aesthetic level, the fact it's even on this system with all 3 islands (Portland Island, Staunton Island and Shoreside Vale), the streets and the exact map layout of each. As for how the game looks, the GTA series has never really had an attractive look and on the PSP, it's a bit more forgiveable.Sound/Music: The GTA series has always had great voice acting and in this one, there's a few notable roles that work well while others just don't really fit and lack a certain something. Tony for example doesn't really have the drive of Tommy or the care of CJ (yes I said care), this guy just feels more \"\"angry mode\"\" than anything. The music comes from the radio stations when you're on a vehicle and I never did like GTA3's radio stations and often listened to the Chatterbox though in some cases on a more intense mission, I had big operatic orchestral music on like Double Clef FM.Gameplay: III started the whole \"\"open-ended gameplay\"\" that many have been copying which allow you to traverse the city and do whatever you feel like. That's here as well from taxi and vigilante missions to the main stories, or just doing insane jumps and finding hidden packages, completists could have a ball with this one. The main story missions are the same as always: pick someone up and drop em off and/or shake off cops, blow up something or go on assassin sprees where you have to off someone. The problem comes in the narrative where there was always a drive to the missions but since the story wasn't that intriguing, the missions felt more like tasks to do or errands.Controlling on the PSP did feel different since I was so used to the Dual Shock and the analog gets the job done although sometimes it was too finicky with me trying to correct myself and the lack of a good camera control doesn't help. Pushing the L shoulder and moving the analog allows a rotating camera but it always felt awkward. The other notable problem is the targeting system where it's way too easy to target civilians or others instead of the guy you want and enabling the free-aim by pressing the down button felt sluggish and it's best to just reposition. Other than that, the game still controls the same, although you can't swim (poo).If you're old enough and were a fan of the game, it's a good idea to check out Liberty City Stories. It's not quite the best in the series or the worst but it's worth looking into it anyway.\"", "INTRO: The GTA games are easily some of the most popular and controversial games of all time. The latest entry, Liberty City Stories, is set in Liberty City in 1998, three years before  GTA:III. You play as Toni Cipriani, who was also in III.GAMEPLAY: It's GTA on the go, and it's as great as the PS2 titles. Liberty City is pretty much the same as it was in III, with a few differences. Also, it has features that weren't in III, like motorcycles, knives, ability to damage cars by punching them, etc.The gameplay is pretty much like others: kick-@$$ fun. Do missions for the Mafia, find hidden packages, go on rampages, steal cars, shoot people, fight in gang wars, do hidden missions, and much more.There's online multiplayer games, too. Although I don't know how to get online on my PSP (LOL.)GRAPHICS: Awesome for a portable game. They look as good as III's graphics.SOUND: Great voice acting, and awesome sound effects.MUSIC/RADIO STATIONS: Meh. The music on the radio station's OK, but I like III's better. However, you can listen to music that's downloaded onto your PSP instead. (Kind of like the X-Box versions.) Very neat.OVERALL: An AWESOME portable game that will keep you addicted for hours. If you have a PSP, this is essential.", "\"Ok, I admit it:  When I heard that GTA: LCS was coming out on PSP, I actually sold my Gameboy SP and games and bought a bare PSP.The game is a mixture of GTA 3, with a sprinkle of Vice City and San Andreas.  In fact, if you have played GTA 3, you already know the map!  The VC and Sa part of the game is that you now have Sanchez bikes all over the city and see vague sightings of some places from SA as well as the characters that you might've heard in Las Venturas.Controls:  A bit slugish, since you don't have as many buttons to choose from.  To aim, you need to hold down the L-key and press the \"\"O\"\"  However, just like with anything, you will eventually get used to them.Radio Stations:  GTA 3 Stations with NEW content:  LCFR(Chatterbox) where you will hear from Lazlow; Head Radio, Lips 106, Double Cleff FM, Rise FM, K-Jah, MSX 98, Flashback FM;  NEW STATIONS: Radio Del Mundo and Liberty Jam featuring DJ Clue as himself!!!Packaging:  Map/Poster and the instuctional manual, which resembles a mini-newspaper.Bottom Line:  If you loved the previous GTA games and you currently own a PSP, you HAVE TO get this---You won't be sorry!\"", "\"It did not take long for me to realize how amazing this game is.  The city is enormous, it would be big even on a console.  The missions are surprisingly un-repetitive, veterans of the series will know what I mean.  The city layout is very unbalanced, which I mean in a good way, being that the everywhere is pretty unique.  I never feel like I am going around in the same places, there are areas that I can recognize and anyone can become familiar with the city.  It would probably take awhile though as it is fairly complex.The controls are excellent, movement is very easy after awhile and driving is amazing.  The only problem is that aiming weapons can be a tad tough, the targeting system is a bit problematic as it homes in on one target, then you can cycle one at a time to the left or right.  It isn't particularly easy to get that one guy bothering you behind your back.  Manual aiming can be preferable, but I wish there were sensitivity adjustments because trying to make quick adjustments, well, isn't doable.There is still a huge variety of vehicles and weaponry, plenty of costumes, and quite a good bit of \"\"GTA Politics.\"\" (Rival gangs will shoot at you and friendly ones will occasionally help you out)I have been playing for about 5 days now, with a lot of time put in and I have only just hit the 50% mark for the story completion.  I really look forward to the next half of it and I know I will continue to play after I am done.A sure 10/10\"", "\"Finally, GTA is here for the PSP.  If you are still deciding whether to get this or not, I say go for it.  While GTA: LCS is not the \"\"killer app\"\" that GTA 3 was for the PS2, it's nonetheless tons of fun and endless excitment, coupled with lots of handheld violence and one-person mayhem.There's no doubt that this is simply the best PSP game so far, and it takes full advantage of the PSP's processing and graphic powers.  The graphics is fantastic on the PSP, and the framerate for the most part excellent.  A couple times you'll notice some choppiness, but otherwise it's just like on the good ol' PS2.  The controls are mostly good, except this game inherits the maddening aiming scheme from GTA 3, so when you are in the middle of a Godfather-like shootout, you'll wish for better aiming controls.  But that's just a minor complaint.What stopped me from rating this 5 stars -- my inclination is to give it an overall rating of 4.5 stars (90%) -- is the level design is just too similar to GTA 3.  You are back in Liberty City, with pretty much the same layouts.  Neighborhood names have changed, but otherwise the environment and the characters look (and sound) exactly the same.  The gameplay is also pretty much the same, which is great but at the same time a little, shall we say, hackneyed.Still, this is a must-have title for any PSP gamers.\"", "For any Grand Theft Auto fan - this game is a must-have.  You can finally play Grand Theft Auto on the go, at work :), or (my favorite) at school.  Upon first turing on the game, I noticed that it is the same city as GTA3.  The game is essentially GTA3, just with new cars, new people, and new missions.The graphics are great and the controls are great.  In fact, the controls are just like the controls in GTA3, so it was extremely easy to adapt to.  My only two complains are that the speech in the game sound a little low-quality, and every once and a while the graphics get a little choppy - mainly around huge numbers of effects like massive multi-car accidents.Other than those two slight problems with the game, I have found heaven on the PSP - Grand Theft Auto on the go.", "This game is fantastic and Rockstar did their damdest to fit a lot of stuff on 1 small disc.  This game walks all over the GTA game that was released on the GBA by a long shot.  Gameplay is open ended as always and so far difficulty is not too bad.  The controls will take some getting used to but you can switch from using the analog nub to using the d pad if you wish.  I am very impressed with the graphics and sound quality isn't too bad.  Now I'm not sure but have read that in order to access the custom soundtrack abilty you have to reach level 20 before you can access the feature.  I would give this a soild 9 just for the gameplay alone.  One downer for me Toni and Donald Love are voiced by other actors and not by Michael Madesen or Kyle Maclachlan but I still give this 2 thumbs up.  Bravo Rockstar.", "This game was the main reason I bought a PSP.  And to be honest, it is worth every penny.  The graphics aren't quite as detailed but still very impressive.  The action feels just as gritty and real as on the big-brother consoles.  Pretty cool storyline but there is an issue with repetition as far as the missions go.  My only complaints are that the game freezes up sometimes, and that the pedestrians on the street don't talk as much junk as on the other versions.Still, get this game.", "\"Talk about the ultimate mobile game for mature gamers who love the Sopranos and Godfather series. Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is the perfect game for the PSP.Let me say again - this is a MATURE game. There is sex, there is swearing, there is a LOT of violence. Anybody who buys this game for their 8 year old is making a grave mistake. It really bothers me a lot when people buy adult games for kids and say \"\"Oh I didn't know\"\". It clearly says right on the box. There are a TON of adult gamers out there, and we like mature games, just like we like R rated movies. These games aren't meant for kids. They are made exactly the way us adults like them - full of adult situations.That being taken care of, this is an *incredible* game. Let's start with the gameplay. It's hard to even imagine, looking at say a DS or GameBoy game, that any handheld could produce gameplay like this. You have a fully detailed, fully laid out cityscape. You can drive down any road, walk around amongst the people, watch the rain and sun and fog roll in. The storyline is great. The missions are great. Heck, even the sidegames are great. There are hidden packages to find, rankings to achieve, races to run, you name it. You could play this for months.The graphics are spellbindingly beautiful. It's hard to believe this is a handheld game. You get rain falling down around your car as it careens past easily identifiable stores on a road, while pedestrians stroll down the sidewalks. From shooting tasks, to driving races, to handling a number of other situations, the graphics draw you into this world.Let's talk about audio. There is a great selection of \"\"radio stations\"\" to listen to as you drive around. The voice acting really draws you into the story, to relate to the various characters involved. I've always loved the audio on the GTA games, and this is no exception.Yes, this game requires a 2.0 update to run. The update is INCLUDED ON THE DISK. Anybody who has trouble finding it must be missing some basic computer skills. It's right on the main disk menu when you put the disk into the system. It's free, it's included, it's easy.I can't say enough good things about this game. Let me try to figure out some down sides. Hmmm, well it's on a small screen. Heck, that's the whole point, that it's on a portable system. When I go on trips, I can bring it along with me. I think that's fantastic, to have a GTA system to bring on the plane or bus. I *did* find the storyline in general to be on the annoying side, truth be told. I really liked the original GTA3 storyline where you were a valued employee moving up in the ranks due to your skill. I found it frustrating in this one to play in essence an \"\"uppity jerk\"\" who is constantly put down either by his own mob buddies or his mom or other people. It didn't make the game nearly as enjoyable for me. This is my leisure time after all, to endulge in fun dreams. My fun dream isn't of being berated and harassed.  That being said, the mom in the Sopranos always drove me completely insane too. You have to give a writer the leeway to write his own story, and if that's what he wants to write, you go with it.This is a must-own game. It's a game for ADULTS. But it's a game with epic scope, great graphics, and great gameplay. Highly, highly recommended.\"", "it's supposed to be the killer app for the dying psp. oops. i had hope for this one because vice city was the only good gta game (gtaiii and san andreas= very overrated and very poorly done). i'm afraid this one is quite disappointing, although its graphics are almost as good as the horrible san andreas's (the worst ps2 graphics of any game). many people who held on to their psps hoping it would get better are now in line at their local video games store trading them in for the much superior nintendo ds and a pack of gum. the psp is dead in the water, and the xbox 360 just might do the same to the ps3 and its hard-to-program-for architecture. sony= the new sega...", "The Good: Great dialog and characters, everything GTA is in tact, hilarious radio shows and commercials, lots of weapons and cars, varied missions, custom soundtracksThe Bad: Extremely difficult at times, terrible targeting, radio shows are repeated often, custom soundtracks are a pain to install, various minor technical issuesBeing one of the most anticipated PSP games of all time Rockstar had a lot of pressure on them to get the game right. LCS feels like a port of the GTA3 engine, but feels nice on the PSP. Everything you love about GTA is intact here and is a great first outing for the little handheld that could. Like all other GTAs you play as a man who is trying to climb to the top of the city.The missions are varied and well put together, but extremely frustrating. I had to use cheats a lot since the game is highly unforgiving. They will put way to many guys in one spot for you, and this is due to targeting and shooting issues. When you lock on with R Toni will target the closest target, but camera issues hinder this. If you have someone shooting behind you you have to turn around, tap L to reset the camera, lock on, then shoot. In this amount of time you will be dead. This is probably the biggest issue in the whole game. Most of the same issues are carried over from GTA3 and this also includes graphical issues like pop-up, weird collision detection, and some audio glitches.The game is surprisingly busy for a handheld game with cars and pedestrians everywhere, you can do everything you could in GTA3 like steal cars, do taxi, police, and fire truck missions. Unlike GTA3, however, you can ride motor cycles. There are a ton of weapons to use in the game, tons of cars, and lots of missions to do. Missions vary from escorting, on rail shooting, protecting, delivering, stocking, and assassinating. The characters in the game are lively and the dialog is awesome. The radio stations talk shows are my favorite part in the game. They are hilarious and completely outrageous like GTA should be. There aren't enough of them though (about 5) and after you get into 5+ hours into the game they get repetitive, and the same goes for the commercials. The songs however aren't very good, and I don't even think any of them are licensed. This can be changed by playing custom songs off your memory stick, but it requires a weird converter on your PC and isn't very user friendly, but its there and I love it. In fact LCS was the first PSP game to use custom soundtracks so kudos to Rockstar for doing this.The game looks very good for a 2005 PSP game. It looks like an upgraded version of GTA3 which isn't bad, but if love GTA4 and have the pre-GTA4 games you will not like this at all. Some times the game can look really good when you riding into the sunrise and light is reflecting off the water and everything around you. Everything is actually 3D and doesn't look flat and retarded like you might think. So, bottom line, if you want a great GTA game pick up LCS, and its even a good entry into the series if you have never played it before.", "The year is 1998 and Toni Cipriani has been laying low for a while now. Salvatore Leone requires his services and takes him under his wings, Toni must work his way to the top to become Capo. However, gangsters and other families stand in his path to the top.", "I said it before (see my review of Vice City stories) but this game, while certainly a lot of fun, just can't live up to it's big screen brethren.", "\"GTA: Liberty City Stories is the first game in the series to hit the PSP, and you can bet it won't be the last. Given the dismal crop of PSP titles currently available, an original PSP-only GTA game couldn't have arrived at a better time. And the good news is, Liberty City Stories is a real Grand Theft Auto game, through and through. Whether you love the GTA series or despite it, the fact is that Liberty City Stories is on the same quality level as its bigger brothers on the PS2, Xbox, and PC. You'll be surprised by how few compromises Rockstar made in order to bring the world of Grand Theft Auto to the PSP. On a visual level, the game looks simply awesome. It's not quite as detailed as Vice City or San Andreas, but it absolutely destroys the original GTA 3. The graphics look so clear that you can read the type on fliers and billboards posted around town, even on the small-ish PSP screen. As series fans well know, the game is set in the New York-inspired Liberty City. Liberty City itself is ripped straight from GTA3, and it's never looked better. From the huge crowds of pedestrians to the cars, you'd be hard-pressed to tell Liberty City Stories from GTA3. Toni himself looks fine, if a tad blocky. But in a welcome piece of news, many of the legacy character animations have finally been replaced, so longtime GTA fans won't have to keep looking at the same stupid jump animation that plagued that last three games. Liberty City Stories comes up a tad short when it comes to special effects; you'll notice that effects like explosions won't draw unless they're fairly close to you. But the weather effects are spot-on (and now include snow!), so it's a worthy trade-off. We could do without the infamous blur effect, though. And, there is a noticeable bit of ghosting on the PSP screen--especially when Toni runs; not the game's fault, but it should definitely be noted. Perhaps most important of all is the fact that, despite its visual beauty, Liberty City Stories runs butter-smooth. Even during heated action or driving scenes, you'll be hard-pressed to spot any framerate stuttering. The core gameplay is ripped straight from earlier entries in the series, so you'll find that Toni can't pull himself onto walls or boost his stats like C.J. could in San Andreas. But aside from a few tiny compromises--you can no longer crouch, for instance--this is the exact same GTA you know and love. We think that's damn impressive. The single-player mode pits you against a succession of missions and side missions, just like the console versions, and this approach holds up very well for brief snatches of gameplay on the bus or the train. When it comes to handheld gameplay, Liberty City Stories is just a natural. We especially love the new PSP-only multiplayer mode, which stands as perhaps the biggest single reason to pick up the game. Up to six players can compete in a local (or \"\"ad-hoc\"\") wi-fi match. There are seven modes in all, and they range from standard deathmatch (Liberty City Survivor) and races (Street Rage) to more sophisticated team-based games where you sabotage enemy cars (Protection Racket) or steal tanks (Tanks for the Memories). Our favorite?:Hit List, an addictive little game for larger groups. In that mode, one player becomes the target while the other players relentlessly stalk him through the city. Fun! Now for the nerdy stuff. The UMD loading speed is surprisingly fast, but load scenes still popped up little too frequently for our tastes. We also appreciate the fact that Rockstar supports custom soundtracks, but we detest the highly limited system that they're using to implement them--you're essentially forced to rip a CD straight to your PSP's memory card. Not an ideal solution at all. But those are quibbling details. Liberty City Stories is a truly worthy entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if you hated the crudely-implemented RPG elements of San Andreas, you might actually prefer this game's simpler approach. Regardless, this is the game that will finally make the PSP a must-own handheld device. You should buy it immediately.\"", "This is the best game I've played so far for the PSP. Everything that I loved about the PS2 GTAs is here. The only problem that I have is that you can't do the head shots like in San Andreas. Anyways this is still a must own game. I love the rap music on here too."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06338801234960556, 0.09679549187421799, 0.01161263883113861, 0.06030522286891937, 0.0016873005079105496, 0.0038665663450956345, 0.06763423979282379, 0.0406808964908123, 0.053804997354745865, 0.009065298363566399, 0.09885565936565399, 0.0017759264446794987, 0.031203309074044228, 0.004320611711591482, 0.07905077934265137, 0.05639271065592766, 0.020620359107851982, 0.0074426233768463135, 0.07824503630399704, 0.09375151246786118, 0.08612972497940063, 0.03337109833955765]]}
