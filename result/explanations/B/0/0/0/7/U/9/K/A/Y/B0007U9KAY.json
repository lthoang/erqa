It was extremely simple to replace my old router using the wizard (even with encryption) and took less than 5 minutes.  Even though the router isn't draft n, I read articles on CNet that it seems to outperform draft n routers in most respects, so why bother with a new standard?  Its a bit bigger than old router, but not having antennas is awesome and other manufacturers should be ashamed of having so many antennas on their boxes that they look like short wave radios.  Do they REALLY expect me to fiddle around with moving antennas for best reception?  Yeah, right, keep dreaming, guys.  I also love the fact that Netgear doesn't install any software on my computer and is controlled through firmware on the router itself, but I don't know if other brands are like this, too.I didn't buy the special matching Netgear RangeMax cards for my laptop or Playstation 3, but the wireless range with \"\"normal\"\" g cards is still notably superior than old g router, they claim 50% better and I believe it.  (Playstation had trouble connecting to old router signal, but is fine now.)  The best part perhaps, though is a significantly faster connection with WIRED connection to my desktop through this router, too, though I don't know why this should be.As far as flashing lights go, yeah, they would be annoying if in you field of vision by my v2 box has a button the back to turn them off. (But I gotta admit, I leave them on sometimes...)Installing wireless routers can sometimes be tricky, so the average ratings are relatively low for wireless routers, but I had no problems.  It costs about $40 more than normal g routers, but worth it in my opinion.\"", "\"I've had this unit for about a month with no issues to report.  Easy setup using the CD on my Vista PC.  I purchased this router because I was switching back to cable from DSL (I had a 2-in-1 with my DSL service) and needed a wireless router.  The router is located in one room and my PS3 and Xbox 360 in another.  We also use a laptop upstairs in which we saw our signal go from \"\"good\"\" to \"\"excellent\"\".  My gaming consoles have also seen a noticable difference in speed in the form of ALMOST lag free online play.  All in all, a great product that has been around for a couple of years = tested and established.\"", "I own this router and a Linksys router.  Both are effective for range, but the nextgear wins hands down for ease of use.Very easy to understand web page (which is how you configure routers by 'logging' onto them).  Just set it up and go.  Whereas the Linksys is complicated even for an advanced PC user.One thing:  The rangemax isn't enabled.  You'll have to turn it on in the 'router webpage', and it really isn't needed unless you've got a huge house or need to be outside with your pc!Great signal, user friendly, and pretty cool looking, PC geek tested and approved!  A+Get it!~BB", "\"I bought this to replace an Apple Airport that died an early death.Setup was easy as soon as I figured how to bypass the \"\"wizard\"\"--more like a junior apprentice, really. It falsely claimed that my ISP gives me a static IP address. Had I followed along, it probably would have worked for a while and then failed mysteriously. The cheat sheet has bypass instructions, and then the setup is very nice. It is completely web-based without forcing you to install any software on your computer.I run Linux, Mac and Windows, and all connect just fine.The range improved nicely, as advertised. Having internal antennas is an advantage--one less thing to break.The only irritation are those blinking blue lights that you cannot turn off. (I read that you can open the box and disconnect the ribbon cable, but that seems a drastic step.) Covering them with cardboard is not a perfect remedy since light still emanates from the air vents.In summary: (1) DO NOT install the CD (2) DO NOT use the \"\"wizard\"\"; go directly to the advanced setup (3) Wear dark sunglasses when facing the device\"", "I am a big fan of Netgear equipment. In fact this router was supposed to replace my trusty Netgear WGR614 that served me flawlessly for over 5 years of continuous power-on service before dying this week. After hooking up this new RangeMax router and the install routine confirming that I was connected to the router, I could never log into the router nor get connected to the internet. I finally gave up and returned it. Today I bought a new Netgear WGR614 v9 ... you know the model that served me so well for over five years ... Netgear still makes them! ... and the install was plug and play. Could log right into the router and configure the wireless and had instant internet access. Get the WGR614 if you want a reliable wireless router!!", "When this router arrived, it didnt come with the standard packaging. I realized this was a refurb, which made sense as to the low price.  It was NOT clearly marked as a refurb and I am currently researching to see if it was advertised as brand new merchandise.To make matters worse, port forwarding doesnt work with a standard install unless you take down the SPI feature of the router, making it less secure.  The fancy lighting is useless and has no functionality other than to fire off blue light.  Fortunately this can be turned off.If laptop is put in sleep mode, it has a VERY difficult time reconnecting, sometimes having to reboot in order to get a clean connection.  Signal strength also seems to be less than advertised but this may be the reason it was a refurb.  I think there are better routers for the money.  I wont go with netgear again.", "My previous wireless router died suddenly, so I searched reviews looking for one which would offer better range for my 802.11G laptop, Wii and PSP. This one quickly bubbled to the top.Configuration took a few minutes. The router works perfectly. The light show is WOW! If you look at the picture of this product, the blue LEDs under the dome on top are very bright, and flash in some pattern that has to do with the 7 internal antennas being accessed. We enjoyed the lights for a couple of nights, then clicked the button to turn them off. The version for sale today has a button in the back to stop the show.The router itself does the job. Wireless networks were pretty exciting 5 years ago, but now you just expect them to be simple and work. This one fits that description nicely. It would have gotten a fifth star if range had increased dramatically from my previous router, but the coverage is very similar with my G devices. Other users report better range when you purchase Rangemax cards, but all my wireless devices have built-in WiFi.", "Having gone through two wireless routers from Linksys and D-Link with some frustration, I am on to my third router, this NETGEAR WPN824.  First, it was quite interesting to see a white router with a blu center.  Doesn't match anything in my office but because it looks so different and it promoted the internal seven antennas for a pretty good price, I had to give it a try.Hooking things up and getting it ready and working was a breeze.  Beginners who never setup a router may have trouble (with any router) but everything is explanatory with the onscreen instructions.One of the problems that I had is that the antenna from my last router, just wasn't getting those dead spots all that well.  Using this router, those dead spots that we had are eliminated and we could be in different rooms with our various laptops and everything is working fine.Overall, for its price and what it offers is pretty cool.  Dig the spinning blue lights around the center and the green lights on front.So, far so good and no intermittent dropoffs either.  Definitely recommended!", "The only problem I have had with our wireless set up using this router was having to switch to WEP so my son could use it with his Nintendo DS Lite. I had to re-configure my laptop's wireless card (be sure that you have the latest drivers and SW -- I didn't). I had to reduce the maximum speed down to 11 Mbps, so I am not planning on doing any printing through the network until I get a different router for my son to use. It uses a browser based interface so its pretty easy to deal with. I have yet to get the Wii to adjust to the new settings. Through-put is fine as our cable modem is only like 6 Mbps anyway.", "I've had bad experiences with Netgear in the past, but when I moved into my new place, I needed something I could pick up on short notice and this was all they had (Staples). I optimistically hoped to be proven wrong and thought maybe this router would be good.And it is - the router is fantastic, for the 30-45 minutes it is working between crashes. But unfortunately, it is those crashes that make this thing useless.It is one thing for it to be passively useless, but this takes it one step further and is actively annoying on top of it. The flashing blue lights are awful - if you have it out in the open, be sure to get something to cover the lights, otherwise you will go crazy.I will say two good things about this router:1) the crashes seem to be more related to the wireless functionality, and if you are plugged into the unit, it usually still works while the wireless functionality is toast2) it feels great to smash this thing to bits with your fists and watch the blue lights stop working, during one of its regular down periods when you can't get any work done due to this thing sucking.If you can afford it, I highly recommend buying one of these, plugging it in and getting the lights going, and then just beating it until the lights are dead - it is a really satisfying feeling.Unfortunately it is prohibitively expensive for such things, and if accidentally used for its intended purpose of being a wireless router, it may get in the way of an otherwise productive day.If you rely on your net connection for getting your work done - avoid this router. Also, if you have epilepsy, avoid this router.If you have deep pockets and like to break stuff, please buy up the supply of these things and clear the market from this trash - and then destroy them all.", "\"It's small, light, has incredible range and at the time of purchase (18 months ago) was the best value and most highly rated of it's kind out there. I'll be honest, I like Netgear - I usually buy Netgear. I've never, ever had any problems with their equipment. This is my third router. Plug it in, configure it, and stick it in the closet - you're all set. I really find the range to be impressive - you can pick it up like a block away and it's lightning fast.Cons: the blue lights are ridiculous. An obvious \"\"what were you thinking\"\" moment once you see these. But, it shouldn't be a deal breaker. It comes with a little black cap you can cover the blue lights with, and then you never have to give them a second thought.\"", "I have had this router for about 4 years- still very impressed.  Thinking about buying a new router for my one N device but am worried to mess with a good thing.  Have had a problems with some other Netgear products but not this one.  If you just want G- I would highly recommend.  I use AT&T DSL/Speedstream 5100 modem, 3PC/1MAC/WII/ROKU/2IPHONE. I use a Dynamic DNS service with this device so I don't need to have pay for a static IP- has worked great as well.", "I have two of these. the first version and the second revision with the button the turn off the lights. I actually like the lights. My girl don't. I notice that on newer laptops the speed is faster, or if you buy a RangeMax adapter, that works too, but the adapter is also expensive. I wouldn't use another router. My girl wouldn't use another one either. We just love this router.", "Set-up is a breeze.  I had no problems connecting 4 comps and a Xbox 360.  Speeds were just as fast as connecting directly to the modem.Some people dont like the blue lights.  I think they are cool.  If you need a router in your bedroom or dormroom, I would recommend getting something else as lights are bright.  However they went well with all the blue lighting on my comp, but I dont sleep in the same room.This was the first netgear router I have used, before I used Linksys, but got tired of ports failing and the incompatability issues I had with non-Linksys usb wireless adapters.  The netgear seems to work with everything.", "\"I tried this out in a 3-story house built in the late 1800s, with thick walls.  I have an old NetGear MR814 v1 (the original one with the removable antenna) on the THIRD FLOOR (yes, I know, not a good spot, but it's where I can get to the DSL connection).The MR814 covered the whole house acceptably, except for one dead area in one room.  I was hoping that this router would improve things.Forget it.  The signal strength is not one bit better, at any location in the house, than it was with the old router.  I am using all legacy 802.11b devices on it, but so what?  It's supposed to improve those as well, and it does not.Bottom line: It works, but it's absolutely no better than my old router.  Also, I often use this network with live high-speed (like 500kbps - 1Mbps) videoconferencing streams.  They work fine through this router, but no better than through the old one.People need to step back and think about this obsession with faster and faster wireless networks.  Even if you have a really fast cable modem or DSL connection to the internet, getting you 2 MBps, that's still way slower than old 802.11b.  Unless you are trying to copy files between multiple machines inside your house, or you have something like 5 computers simultaneously connected to the router, you will gain NOTHING by going to g, or \"\"Plus\"\" or any other wireless standard, because 802.11b is still way faster than your internet connection is.I was only interested in this router for increased range, and it doesn't live up to its promise.\"", "Easy setup, and good range.However, the unit seems to overheat or, for whatever reason, will stop working without warning once a month or so.  I haven't figured out what causes it, but I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then restart it.Also, the flashing blue lights are INCREDIBLY annoying.  I haven't figured out how to shut them off."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00021125561033841223, 0.00013785946066491306, 0.0029669529758393764, 0.0010732298251241446, 0.021840939298272133, 0.1332501322031021, 0.0001323292963206768, 0.003971492405980825, 0.0005552383372560143, 0.21772196888923645, 0.012971804477274418, 0.16383954882621765, 0.17079323530197144, 0.07963334769010544, 0.007669691927731037, 0.18323102593421936]]}
