If it is, you've got to buy this.For smaller drawings, I'll do CAD work at home and I missed my work SpaceNavigator so much, I bought this one for home! I was so mad at trying to get the exact perspective I wanted and couldn't with just a normal mouse -- so that night, I drank beer instead of working.What the SpaceNavigator does... Think of it as like a joystick -- but flying a helicopter: Tilting it forward (like just pushing on a normal joystick) and it's like you rotate forward and look down. Pushing it directly forward without tilting zooms; or you could say the helicopter flies directly forward. Twisting -- now this just can't be done with a normal mouse. This is where your helicopter is hovering and spins left or right.The base is VERY heavy, so it doesn't move around while you're controlling it. If you allow clutter on your desk, papers leaning on it can cause input -- so if your CAD drawing's perspective goes all crazy, this is why. If you leave something on it for a few months, it might get \"\"stuck\"\" and thankfully the driver has a calibrate feature that fixes this.\"", "\"I own two of these devices... one for my computer at home, and another for use at work (since my current employer doesn't supply this sort of device, and makes us work with the generic, cheapo Dell mice and keyboards unless we spend our own money).Back quite a few years ago, the company behind this created a controller called the \"\"SpaceOrb\"\", aka the \"\"Spaceball\"\".  This was, essentially a pool cue ball on a stick, which you could manipulate to achieve six degrees of freedom.  (That's three axes of rotation and three directions of movement.)  Eventually, the assets behind this technology was purchased by Logitech (who had previously had their own, less successful, mainly-oriented-towards-games device) and the current \"\"puck\"\" style devices came to be.  It's very similar to the old technology, insofar as the device provides both movement (by pulling, pushing, or \"\"lifting/pressing\"\" the puck, or rotation, by tilting it or rotating it.  It's less expensive than the old version, and seems (to me) to be a bit easier to manipulate overall, though that's a matter of personal taste I suppose.There are many applications where this device can be used.  It's not just useful for pure-3D applications (it can be used to pan and zoom in graphics programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, for example).  One of the most \"\"fun\"\" applications for using this is Google Earth, where it can be used to fly over the 3D terrain, through the 3D city streets, and so forth.  It's terrific to get a feeling for locations you're going to visit in the near future.I suppose there may be some applications for this in games, though I have no idea how this might work.  The MAIN role of this is for use in 3D application.  Virtually every CAD program today has full support for this (or other similar devices - and there are a few out there from other suppliers).  You can move a CAD \"\"part\"\" or \"\"assembly\"\" just by holding the \"\"puck\"\" in your hand and applying rotational or translational pressure on the device.A significant number of 3D rendering packages also have full support for this... programs like Lightwave, Maya, 3DStudioMax, and so forth.  But realize, if the program does not support 3D controllers, or if 3DConnexion hasn't provided a \"\"plugin\"\" to provide that support, this will not be useable (or at least, it will be very difficult to get it to do what you want!).There are some programs out there...  especially some game programs which were ported from consoles to the PC...  which can become confused when this is plugged in.  So, on rare occasions, I have to unplug it (otherwise, a game character may start spinning uncontrollably!)  The \"\"Dead Space\"\" games are notoriously bad for this, for example.  It's a trivial thing to fix, but it's deeply annoying.  It's not the fault of 3DConnexion, though...Once you've gotten accustomed to using this device (or any of the other devices with the same \"\"core\"\" controller element which 3DConnexion makes, most of which have a bunch of extra buttons in addition to the \"\"puck\"\"), it's hard to go back to using the mouse  and keyboard to do the same thing.The price is right... this device is hundreds of dollars less than the other \"\"extra buttons\"\" versions, and give the functionality you really need (I don't need to program \"\"shortcuts\"\" into the buttons, but I DO need the \"\"puck\"\" element!).One small issue...  on occasion, with earlier versions of the software, I would have USB detection failures.  This hasn't been an issue in four or five years for me, though.  But nevertheless, it's something to look out for.  If the device isn't properly detected... say, because you plugged it in before installing the drivers...  you might have occasional annoyances with getting it to work properly.  Fortunately, more recent driver versions do a pretty good job of cleaning out \"\"bad\"\" registry data caused by plugging it in without drivers installed.\"", "\"Here's my evaluation of the Space Navigator (used primarily for DAZ Studio).The hardware is first class, solid heavy duty unit sits on the desktop beautifully and is a joy to view and manipulate.The configuration/setup is very poorly done. It is really confusing and does not allow you to actually interact with the controller in order to decide and then immediately set whether you want normal or the inverse directional setting. The number of motions/directions are poorly illustrated and explained. This is not a trivial point, because not having this done right means wasting a lot of time once you understand what you need to do and what works for you.The worst problem is that one of the main control movements is not clearly explained. If you grasp the Space Navigator and anchor your hand on the desktop to provide a firm anchor and simply move it laterally, without tilting or pulling or pushing the center knob (e.g. restrict movement to the lateral plane parallel to desktop) you get a pure motion but this is never properly explained. The other manipulations such as tilting, or pushing or pulling the central knob are fairly reasonably.It is absolutely crucial that you ANCHOR your hand to the surface the Space Navigator rests on, in order to get the purely lateral movement to work properly. If you are not properly anchored and get even miniscule tilt or push pull, you will get unintended \"\"confusing\"\" movements of your target.The configuration/setup and various guides fail to explain this, or do so very poorly. I figured this out purely by trial and error.A very minor complaint is that a popup comes up everytime you open Photoshop and there is no easy way to tell it not to do that. This is trivial and I mention it simply to show that the software people are not paying attention to users.In summary, this is a Superb 3D Controller, hobbled by an unforgiveably poor SOFTWARE for Configuration/Setup. It's a terrible shame. If you are willing to waste a lot of time figuring it out it is a very useful tool.Like too many computer and computer related devices, this product suffers from software ergonomics problems. The programmers have very poor judgement when it comes to making things easy to learn and use. They need to hire people who understand how to do this and then test and revise software based on improving the areas where people are having difficulty. This needs to be done iteratively until problem areas are gone and novice users learn to configure,setup, and use the product rapidly with little or no complaints. Only then will the ingenuity and creativity of the the hardware designers be fully realized and appreciated.\"", "\"When creating 3D models and objects, navigating in, out and around can be a bit of a chore.  This \"\"mouse\"\" with its degrees of freedom really gives you new ways of 3D navigating.\"", "This basic model works well, getting used to it is not easy, it will take a couple of days of fiddling with it. Works in Freecad older versions of sketchup and in solidworks, Google earth and in a bunch of other applications with their universal drivers. I had a bit of a misconception though, this should not replace your mouse in these applications but supplement your control of the environment along with a standard mouse, in fact calling this a mouse would not be appropriate it is a 3d controller intended to be use by your other hand, that is the hand you don't use for your mouse while your primary hand remains at the mouse.", "This is a great product, but it does take some learning to use it efficiently.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would.  I bought it to use when I play Second Life.  My name is LIMBORG LOON on Second Life.", "I had high hopes for this product. I do some 3D modeling now and then, and figured a 3D navigational device would be a great help. The product itself is good. It has a great feel with three rotational directions - roll, pitch and yaw - and three motion directions - up-down, left-right and forward-backward. I am sure many will find this to be a wonderful gadget.My problem was with Poser 8. I downloaded and installed the drivers. That went smoothly enough. I was indeed able to move about in my scenes, looking this way and that, but there was no way to manipulate and item or parameter using the navigator. This seemed to be an obvious feature, but a check of the documentation - such as it is - showed nothing. Still, being able to move my main camera around in the scenes was pretty useful.Then, as I loaded in more complicated scenes, Poser 8 started to crash randomly and frequently. I installed the various Poser 8 updates and reinstalled the driver with no change in behavior. I undid the installation, the crashes stopped.I wound up returning the device. I still think it is a pretty neat device and will meet the needs of many other customers, but it doesn't work with my configuration. As always, your mileage may vary.", "Anyone doing 3D modeling, particularly in architecture, really has to have one of these devices if their software supports it.The SpaceNavigator supports several products that I use on a daily basis:  Graphisoft ArchiCAD, Abvent Artlantis Studio, Google SketchUp and Google Earth.  [Right-handed user assumed here...] It is placed to the left of the keyboard, so that you have you right hand still on your mouse. It is not a selection device, but a navigation device.Navigating in 3D in many 3D applications is a jerky process - smooth pan, rotate, etc followed by moving your mouse to a new position (causing a pause in the action) and start moving again.With the SpaceNavigator, movement is fluid and (if you change the preferences to high speed) - fast (and fun)!The SpaceNavigator can be set up to work in your model in either a fly-through mode or in 'object' mode.  I prefer 'object' mode.  If I am looking at a building, the movement of my hand on the SpaceNavigator is identical to if I was holding a physical model of that building in my hand.  If I rotate away from me, the building rotates away.  Push to the left, the building pans to the left.  Lift on the knob, the building rises on the screen.  Etc.  Extremely intuitive and slightly immersive.In ArchiCAD or Artlantis, I can work much faster than with mouse alone... and in perspective mode,  so the views are more realistic.  I can instantly get to the back side of the building, looking up at the fascia to deal with a rafter issue there, for example.I'm a heavy user of keyboard shortcuts, and do not find that it interferes at all with that, as suggested by another reviewer.  The device is immediately to the left of my Cap Lock key, so it is milliseconds to get my hand back over the keyboard.With clients, there is almost no need to generate animations (movies) since you can move accurately and fluidly in OpenGL to walk through a building in real time.  But, even for animations, the SpaceNavigator lets you quickly set up camera positions.Google Earth is pretty fun with it, too - again, completely fluid navigation, vs the move, pause, jerk kind of navigation achieved with a mouse.Note that this review is on the SE page, but applies to the PE model as well. The license is the only thing I hate about this thing.  The SE and PE models are identical, differing only in their license details.  The SE is for non-commercial work, the PE for commercial (for profit).  You can 'upgrade' an SE to a PE on the manufacturer web site - although it is cheaper to buy a PE here at Amazon in the first place.", "\"Well, I certainly don't find this input device very usable. Even after a short time of playing with various programs like Google Earth and SecondLife my hand starts hurting. The problem is mainly that software designers like those at Google demand that in order to use the thing to fly very slowly over a city, your hand needs to constantly press the knob in the lateral direction, where there is the most resistance. It's really hard on the tendons of the hand to sustain that pressure constantly over the course of several minutes.The device is much more usable in the 3d animation suite \"\"Blender.\"\" There, you turn the object around only intermittently as you're working... so there's not nearly as much stress on the hands.Another concern is that Linux support is dismal. The drivers which are available on the company's website do not install under Ubuntu Ocelot (11.10)... and I had equally little luck in following all the advice from hobbyists out there who posted on the internet about their attempts to get the thing working with Ubuntu. Linux is fast becoming my main operating system, and so this is a major problem. It does work fine under XP and Win7.All that said, the build quality on the device is exquisite. No complaints there. It has a brushed metal base, the hard rubber knob, and a lot of weight to keep the thing in one place as you press the knob this way and that (it feels like it's made of lead). The knob only moves 1/2 a centimeter to a centimeter in any given direction. It does not twist in circles like you might expect from looking at its design.\"", "This is one well-built, hefty little fella.  I just wish it worked as a mouse in its off-time.I bought the SpaceNavigator to work with Rhino on a Mac because of a Lynda.com tutorial.The video instructor failed to mention that his experience was limited to a Windows system and that while the 3D mouse worked just fine within that operating environment, he did not know if it would work in a Mac environment.I received a suggestion from the Lynda.com instructor that I use the Navigator in place of my current input device.  According to technical support at 3D Connection, the Navigator is not a mouse as it cannot be used for &#34;clicking.&#34;Prospective purchasers of this device should check with McNeel (Rhino's publisher) to see if drivers have been written for the device within their OS - or if people at Rhino even use it. The direct quote from the technician at McNeel was, &#34;I don't use the thing (3D Navigator) because it makes me nauseous.&#34;", "I won this at a seminar, and didn't know about it at the time.  I could not go without this device now. I've been doing 3d drafting for 4 years and there is no question that it saves time.  It makes it much, much easier to manipulate parts while drafting.  It is a heavy, solidly built piece that has held up well.  I use mine with Inventor and Autocad, can't comment on other programs.Just be careful carrying this in your laptop bag in airport security- the TSA thought mine was a bomb or something...", "Not as tactile as expected, but very accurate.  Was hoping it would be faster, but that's probably a software configuration (that I haven't found).  Used on Blender.", "I bought this to use with a 3D modeling package and an imaged editing program.  I also wanted to use it for second life.  It works very well, though it does require some practice.It should be noted that it connects to the first program activated accepting the 3D mouse and will ignore all of the others.  It does not follow the focus of the cursor.It does work flawlessly with a wacom usb tablet and usb mouse.", "I use autocad inventor and after using this 3d knob I don't ever want to go back to using just a mouse. It's a solid heavy product that's fully customizable and runs perfect in a windows environment. It also works well with mac but not so well in a virtual machine like parallels. Designing with this has made it fun and intuitive. Being able to move your model around while working is truly something to be experienced. I would pay double for this if I had too.", "This is a good piece of kit, works as described.Works in Photoshop but not lightroom as of this writing.being able to move around the work space in 3D applications is a thing of beauty.I enjoy working with google sketch-up and this. it allows me to fly through the environment as if controlling a helicopter.my only gripes are I wish the USB cable was longer and the base was a little bit heavier, I might use double sided velcro take to fix the base where it is needed.", "\"This was an easy 5-star to give.  The SpaceNavigator gets as much use as my mouse.  Yeah, really.  You wouldn't think so until you get one to go along with 3D development environments (SecondLife, Maya, Google Earth, others).  If I had to summarize what it's like to use, it's like a complete flight-simulator in your left hand.  Push down, you go down; pull up, you go up; twist it and you turn; push left right back and forth and you go those directions.  You can even control the rate of motion.  After using it for a day in a 3D environment it's almost like thinking and you see the motion happen in front of you.For SecondLife users, you can move your avatar naturally.  None of that \"\"bumping into doorways\"\" thing.  Click the side button and you start moving the in-world camera like you've got it in the nose of a helicopter.  For users of 3D modeling systems, you gain that same easy camera motion for looking at your models and scenarios.  Google Earth is a fun free thing that uses SpaceNavigator and you just fly yourself around.What's crazy fun is to use the mouse and the SpaceNavigator simultaneously.I've used it with photoshop, but frankly it's a bit robust a tool to use with Photoshop.  Perhaps a bit like getting a swiss army knife when the only thing you really need is a screwdriver.There are games available that take advantage of the SpaceNavigator, but they aren't any that I own currently, so I can't comment on how it works with them yet.  Maybe later I can come back and add a video review that shows the SpaceNavigator in action.[followup]I returned to edit my review. It was quite nice of Amazon to let me know that I convinced another person to get one of these. The manufacturer officially owes me one *grin*. Since I originally reviewed space navigator, Blender (the free 3D modeling program) went through a life-changing revision and this is a great too for that application.So, the groove is there. Those of us fans of FPS games need to get game makers to support the 3D mouse. Imagine playing Half-life or Bioshock (sure... version 3 of both) where your left hand fluently moves your character via 3D mouse and your right hand uses the conventional mouse to aim and shoot. How more real is that? The future is at our fingertips: does anyone besides me see it?\""], "Gamma": [0.031719405204057693, 0.031725700944662094, 0.031641338020563126, 0.024160142987966537, 0.031725700944662094,
