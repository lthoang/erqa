"], "reviews": ["This is a good alternative formula to those who are no longer breastfeeding or are transitioning to/supplementing with formula. I particularly like that it is dairy free, and contains added iron.Of course, taste buds in babies are as individual as they are in adults, so your baby might not like it. Also, beware of feeding a soy-based formula as some babies who can't tolerate milk, can't tolerate soy either. With this product, YMMV. Try it out and see if it works for you.", "I tried this with my niece who has always been a bit gassy. I thought she would really benefit from it. Unfortunately, she just didn't like the taste and just didn't take to it. So can't really say how effective it would be.", "\"She's less than 8 months old and she finishes a \"\"can\"\" every 3 weeks about.  Seems to taste exactly like standard formula based on the little finger licks here and there when we handle her bottles.  She started on her mothers milk and now soy and seems to be a smooth transition.  We will also have to do a little test with her on milk based Enfagrow Toddler Transitions Powder Cans and hope that will go well.\"", "To be honest, I tried this formula, because formula is expensive, and this one was offered to me! ;) My son(10months) has had a history of spitting up worse than either of my other two. It started as soon as he was born, and it has improved greatly as he's got older. We went to formula full time when his stomach seemed to reject my breastmilk, and he was losing a lot of weight.He's did pretty well on some of the formulas he's used. Gentlease was great, except for the fact that it cause SEVERE constipation. He did well with the regular Toddler Transitions formula, so we will keep it in mind if milk doesn't agree with him in a couple of months. He's did the best with the AR formula. We LOVE it!All of that to say that this formula caused my little one to start spitting up very soon after using it. It's definitely worth a try for babies with colic! For spitting up? I'd start with a different formula. Based on our experience, I'd recommend using AR. He's had almost no spitting up with it and no constipation.", "Priced reasonably. If you're unable to breastfeeding and your child is lactose intolerant, this is a good choice.  My niece used it for her child who was experiencing a lot of gas with her lactose based formula.  She said it was much easier to tolerate.", "Enfamil Prosobee Soy Infant Formula Powder with Iron This Enfagrow Toddler Transitions Formula is handy to take on long car trips. While we prefer to give premade of breast milk, it isn't always convenient to bring it along or &#34;get to it&#34;. We like being able to mix this as needed.We wouldn't use this everyday, but it makes a handy &#34;stop gap&#34;.CFH", "There was a point where our son was being very fussy and would get lots of gas. We tried different bottles to see if that would take care of the problem but it didn't. We tried this and it worked great. We weaned our son into this and finally had him full on on this for about a month. No gas and very little fussiness. These were pretty expensive so we went back to the regular formula. The gas and fussiness didn't come back. Could have been a stage in our sons development. Overall a great product from Enfamil.", "No formula, particularly soy based, smells or tastes particularly good.  This is easy to mix up, it is well tolerated and as long as the child is unaware that better tasting food is out there, you should be pretty successful in getting it down.  This is no better or worse than others on the market and a bit cheaper than a comparable Similac product.  It is however far more expensive that the brands sold by CVS or Meijer and honestly, I think that they are just as good.", "One of the things I like about the powdered formula itself is that it is shelf stable.  Similar to things such as powdered milk, the formula will need to be kept in a cool, dry place.  The expiration date is approximately a little more than a year.  I used to purchase a ready-to-feed formula, but storage was a problem.  Preparation and storage are definitely issues that need to be adhered to.  We have thePhilips AVENT Electric Steam Sterilizerand have made good use of it over time.There are Enfamil formulas that you can tailor to your specific child&#8217;s needs.  This is very similar to the soy formula I used and is specifically for the baby that is very fussy and has frequent gas issues.  Soy formula is &#8220;easy on the tummy,&#8221; and I&#8217;d agree wholeheartedly.  Powder is powder and sometimes problematic to fix, but a premium formula like Enfamil is well worth the effort.  There&#8217;s nothing like having a screaming baby who&#8217;s pulling up his or her legs in pain.  Been there, done that and soy formulas really help alleviate the problem.  I don&#8217;t like the heavy percentage of corn syrup solids, but soy would be very unpalatable without it.FEATURES:&#9658;  Uses soy protein and is tailored to be naturally easy on your baby&#8217;s tummy&#9658;  Milk-free and lactose-free&#9658;  Provides complete nutrition for healthy growth during baby&#8217;s first year&#9658;  Enfamil ProSobee is a soy based formula designed to reduce fussiness and gas sometimes caused by milk-based formulas, while still providing the complete nutrition your baby needs to reach key milestones&#9658;  Enfamil ProSobee provides complete nutrition for healthy growth during baby&#8217;s first yearNUTRITION FACTS, abbreviated (Normal Dilution);  per 100 Calories (5 fl oz):Protein  2.5gFat  5.3gCarbohydrate  10.6gWater  133gLinoleic Acid  860mgINGREDIENTS:Corn Syrup Solids (54%), Vegetable Oil (Palm Olein, Coconut, Soy and High Oleic Sunflower Oils) (26%), Soy Protein Isolate (14%) and Less than 2% Calcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Calcium Carbonate, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Phosphate, Potassium Citrate, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Cupric Sulfate, Potassium Iodide, Sodium Selenite, Mortierella Alpina Oil (a Source of Arachidonic Acid [ARA]), Crypthecodinium Cohnii Oil (a Source of Docosahexaenoic Acid [DHA]), L-Methionine,  Choline Chloride, , Ascorbic Acid, Niacinamide, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin D3, Riboflavin, Thiamin Hydrochloride, Vitamin B6 Hydrochloride, Folic Acid, Vitamin K1, Biotin, Vitamin B12, Inositol, Taurine, Vitamin E Acetate, L-Carnitine,  Vitamin A Palmitate.", "My son is one of those babies who spits up often and a large volume.  He was put on Prosobee when he was about a week old to try to help with this.  While it helped a little, it didn't fix the problem completely.  Overall, I am pleased with the formula, but my one complaint is that the powder doesn't dissolve as well as other milk based formulas.  It leaves a film on the inside of the bottle (that requires a bit of work to wash off) and the liquid is almost a bit gritty.  I ended up going to the ready to feed Prosobee which solved this problem.", "Enfamil has been a trusted name in baby formula for years. This soy formula fills a definite need for babies who are unable to tolerate regular formula. Downside, it STINKS to high heaven!", "Good soy based formula for those babies who are lactose intolerant. Like my gran-daughter. Cows milk formula gives them a belly ache and or stomach ache which makes a very fussy baby. They call it colic which is baby with gas belly ache. Always use under advice of physical as soy can also cause problems with some babies like my new grandson. He can not use soy nor milk based formulas.", "Enfamil Prosobee Soy Infant (ages 0-12 months) is characterized by corn syrup, oils, soy, DHA, choline, vitamins, and minerals.The sugar in milk is non-sweet lactose (disaccharide), which is not absorbed into the bloodstream already in the mouth, as sweet glucose (monosaccharide), which thus is not a healthy substitute for lactose. Unfortunately, milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in Mead Johnson Nutrition formulas except Enfamil Newborn, Infant A.R., Infant Milk-Based Stage 1, and partially EnfaCare, but not for non-sweet maltodextrin (polysaccharide). Corn syrup (solids) contains glucose and - like high fructose corn syrup - may contain fructose, which presence (sweetness) can be masked by adding other sugars. Scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine. So are corn syrup solids with fructose, which content is not provided on the label. Also, high intake of dietary fructose may lead to liver damage from bacteria due to their movement from gut into the blood stream and liver.So, would you like to start your child's obesity and exposure to a potential liver disease (NAFLD) when he/she is an infant, wait for later, or maybe not to accustom the child to corn syrup at all in order to avoid the fructose desire/addiction, as concentrated fructose is not common in nature, humans were not exposed to its consumption, and thus are vulnerable even those who are not obese yet?!DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) found in fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be synthesized in humans. A study found that preterm infants fed DHA had better developmental outcomes, but not the full-term infants or term infants (1-12 mo) who develop normally.  A formula for the newborn (0-3 mo) without corn syrup seems to suit better both the preterm and full-term newborns while no evidence suggests that supplementing DHA for the older infants (3-12 mo) is beneficial.Choline is found in sunflower, soy, cod fish, broccoli, cauliflower, milk, chicken, etc. Endurance athletes and people who drink a lot of alcohol may be at risk for choline deficiency and may benefit from choline supplements.For the record, Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition has 3 lines of formulas: Enfamil Newborn (ages up to 3 months), Enfamil Infant (up to 12 months), and Enfagrow Toddler Transitions (9 to 18 months) and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step Milk Drinks (1 year & up).  Enfamil Newborn is characterized by easy to digest proteins, choline, DHA, and vitamin D. Enfamil Infant is characterized by choline and DHA. Enfagrow Toddler Transitions is characterized by DHA, choline, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants. Enfagrow Toddler Next Step is characterized by calcium and vitamin D, and is available in two flavors: vanilla and natural milk.", "Since this was for a child, since the child didn't like it...it kind of goes without saying that I didn't like it, either.  Rather than taking to this formula, the reaction was more of a &#34;get this away from me as soon as possible,&#34; so we won't be buying it anymore.  Which is kind of a good thing, as I was hesitant to even try this, as soy is quite the versatile food - but with a large array of negative &#34;side effects,&#34; regardless of how it's prepared.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this...nor would the child that wouldn't drink it.", "Prosobee soy formula is specially formulated to reduce gas.  Gas can cause a baby to feel pain, and pain means crying.  The soy formula is milk free and lactose free, but it isn't clear what else about it is there to reduce gas.This particular formula smells bad when I mix it - almost like rotten eggs.  My jar of formula was perfectly fine, and did not make baby sick or anything.  The smell is mentioned in other reviews and is a by product of whatever they do to prevent allergy.  I tasted the formula, just to make sure that was not bad, and it tastes pretty much like Similiac Advance, which I eventually switched to for supplementing.  Baby didn't seem to have a taste preference for or against this.  Apparently, rotten egg smell is disturbing but normal and nothing to be alarmed at.I breastfeed, and selected Prosobee Soy as formula to keep around for my husband to use if I am on a business trip.  For some reason, when I made my selection, I was thinking about introducing foods and someone having said no dairy for the first year, and so that's why I selected this particular formula.  I was thinking to mix it with purees, because I hate to pump milk.  My dairy avoidance was overkill - I didn't realize how common dairy was in formulas, and I didn't first try regular old less expensive formula.I think for formulas, that you start with something easy to get, run of the mill (and, yes, cheap).  Then, if your baby is having problems with that, move quickly to something else.  The role for this specific formula, the Prosobee Soy, is for babies with a milk allergy or who have worked through other formulas and are gassy and in pain.  Milk allergy will cause diarrhea, upset stomach, and gas, and in a baby all of that is going to cause crying and colic.  Ways to spot a milk allergy are to notice a rash, hives, dry flaky patches of skin, and vomiting, and to notice abdominal pain after the baby eats.  I would guess that painful gas would be spotted by a baby crying or being fussy after meals.  It's hard to know when a baby can't talk.The Prosobee Soy formula is pretty expensive.  It's not the first thing to try, but if milk based formulas go along with a baby being fussy after meals, then a soy based formula is worth trying out.For my particular use, allowing my husband to formula feed when I am on a trip, the extra expense is minimal.  A just-in-case jar of formula for a breastfeeding mother is a one time acquisition.  This formula did fine, the two times my husband used it, there was no tummy upset in baby.  Maybe a regular formula that wasn't made specifically to deal with allergies would have been fine also.  Maybe not.  Anyway, the soy formula didn't stick my husband with a colicy baby when I had to travel, so it has served it's purpose.  I will also be mixing this with solid foods instead of breast milk, as baby begins those.One thing that makes me uneasy about this and all formulas is that the number one ingredient is corn syrup solids.  The top three ingredients are corn syrup solids (54%), vegetable oil (26%), and soy protein isolate (14%).  But many, many baby formulas have this same amount of corn syrup.  I feel uncomfortable about the corn syrup, but I guess breast milk is mostly sugar.", "We don't need sensitive formula all the time, but when my infant comes down with a tummy bug, sensitive formulas are the only way to go. She is back and drinking again faster and consuming a greater quantity than she would have on standard enfamil. The prosobee was easy to mix, the powder is very fine and not prone to clumping which can cause gas and discomfort. The formula is light and packed with nutrients. Babies really like the taste as it is quite sweet compared to other types of formula. This is a great formula to have on hand for times when stomach upset takes over the house. The expiration date is over a year away for me, and I can appreciate that.", "Through a bit of medical necessity, we have had to introduce formula.  This formula seemed to be well-tolerated, and greatly minimized gas and tummy rumbling.We avoid corn syrup and its derivatives with the older children (try telling grandma we'd rather she not feed them &#34;fruit&#34; snacks, ugh!), but that's the primary ingredient in this formula.  I suppose it's okay for a limited time, but I do wish there were a different formula.For a soy formula, this has been a good choice.", "ProSobee is a soy based formular from Enfamil. It is designed to reduce fussiness and gas which is sometimes caused by milk-based formulas. Enfamil ProSobee still provides the complete nutrition your baby needs but only uses soy protein. It is tailored to be naturally easy on your baby's tummy. It is 100% milk-free and lactose-free.Sometimes soy can cause constipation. I'd recommend starting slowly and carefully watching to make sure it doesn't affect your baby in this manner. This has happened to my daughter in the past in her toddler years though. She is lactose free as well. This is a powdered base formula as well, pack of 4 22 ounce containers. The price does seem to be higher then stores so I would shop around first to make sure the prices are somewhat the same.", "My baby was constantly gassy and fussy and someone suggested that I try this ProSobee formula.  It was amazing, after her next feeding with this the gassiness and the fussiness was nearly gone.  This is so gentle on my baby's stomach and even though it is expensive, it worked so well for me.", "If you have a child with digestive issues this works well without you having to spend an arm and a leg for the more expensive items. I found this help ease my childs gas as well as cramps and just made it easier for his system to handle. Overall this is a must have product for kids with tummy problems.", "My granddaughter has had excess gas from early on.  Her mother had tried lots of different products with very little difference in results.  She was nervous about trying yet another product however this product was readily tolerated by her so both mom and baby were happy.", "Gassiness in infants is a common problem and fortunately, this is a product proven effective in relieving such a problem.  If this is a problem for your baby, this is definitely recommended.", "The taste is a little weird (for me), but my little niece likes it. My uncle who is a pharmacist looks at the ingredients and he confirms that the powder contains a lot of nutrients which are essential for kids. Overall, good product at reasonable price.", "This formula mixes up great, no clumps and no difficulty mixing at all. Just combine and shake for the best results. The formula contains all the dietary recommendations for an infant and helps reduce gas for children who have problems digesting lactose based formula. This is also a great addition to breastfeeding because it's a gentle formula. According to the baby it tastes great!", "I'm soon to be a mother of 3 and my two younger children both enjoyed Enfamil Formulas.

I would definitely recommend this formula to anyone with a special little baby.", "This soy formula is good for reducing painful gas or for lactose intolerant babies.  We have no complaints.  It is easy to mix and to use.", "This formula came just at the time my baby had developed a bad gas habit. However after trying this for a few days I gave up.
