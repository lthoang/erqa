I played it on PC and I recommend you do as well if you can because I heard the loading times on the Xbox are really long. Now onto the game itself:Being the sequel to an FPS classic that won over 50 game of the year awards let's admit it, Half-Life 2 had some huge shoes to fill. In my opinion, Half-Life 2 is the most underrated FPS out there. What I mean is, despite huge critic praise and the winning of massive amounts of awards, including 38 game of the year awards, I run into people all of the time who STILL haven't played this game!!! And I'm talking FPS fans like me! Here it is, three years later and I still run into them. I don't get it. You could play this game now and it still has solid enough technology to keep up with the newest games in today's market. You won't believe this came out three years ago when you play it!The physics are incredible, the graphics are top-notch and the levels are a blast!Take my word for it. This is probably in my top 5 favorite FPS games of all time. This is a marker for FPS games and for all games in general. THIS IS NOT A GAME TO BE MISSED!! YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TIME TO PLAY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!", "\"The only way to give the XBOX version of this game less than five stars is to have played the PC version of the game.  I've read reviews (Gamespot specifically) that talk about near abysmal framerate/slowdown drops... to the point of freezing the system.  that's cold, man.  and, umm, dead wrong.  I have a feeling someone over there reviewed an unfinished product.  The game is not flawless.  It does have load times every so often (7-10 seconds) but not as bad as Gamespot says (20-40 second load times).  I question the validity of what they were reviewing.  I've never played FPS on PC and I don't doubt it's better.  But I understand to play Half Life 2 on a PC fluidly requires thousands in upgrades, etc.  It's just not worth it to me.  That's a lot of beer I could be drinking, money to be gambling.Anyway, Half Life 2 is just SUCH a playable game.  The environments are really stunning.  It starts in a train station where you soon learn that this world is throat under boot, a completely fascist regime with civilians walking thoughtlessly like escape psyche ward patients.  You'll soon learn that Gordon Freeman, YOU, has a head on his shoulders and is respected among an underground resistance group.  This game oozes similarities to dystopian society of Oceania in Orwell's 1984.  The enemy in the game, similar to 1984, is a faceless totalitarian one.  You'll see resistance posters on crumbling walls.  You'll feel the burdens of this decadent society.  Moreso, You'll feel respected when people recognize you as Gordon Freeman, the hero.I can't say enough for the enviroments.  They are so well rendered, such a great world create, to experience it slowly.. EXPLORING is not a chore...  Taking your time is what you'll want to do, to enjoy the visuals that have been so well-crafted.A big part of this has to do with the putty-like \"\"structure\"\" of the levels, IE the ability to interact with 99% of object on the screen.  Breeaking windows and smashing tables never gets old.  It's fun to throw garbage everywhere, stack a bunch of crap.  And many times you'll need to.The acting and sound in this game is extremely well done.  It's a relief to come across safe havens with friends excited to see you.  Gets you away from the intense action for a little bit, sometimes giving you better weapons.The controls of the game are very good, right up there with Halo, Halo 2, Doom 3 on the Xbox.  Weapon switching is done via directional pad... It's just real easy to get a feel for.To wrap it up, the Xbox version of Half Life 2 deserves five stars.  It's not gonna be a best seller and it's going to suck to geeks with PCs.  It will appeal to drinkers/stoners alike who take their vices too seriously to spend that much money on a good PC.  Yet these creatures of myth also respect the opinions of PC gamers.  I respect a PC gamers opinion.  Why?  Because they do spend all that much money on their hardware.  If they rave girlishly about something, I listen.  But I don't have a great PC like them.  I have an Xbox.  You know where my money goes otherwise.\"", "\"\"\"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference.\"\"For nearly every PC gamer in the world, Half-Life is one of the most recognizable and acclaimed names in the market, and easily in the top tier of first-person shooters. This was further solidified in late 2004 when, after much anticipation and demonstration, Half-Life 2 was finally released on the PC. It was embraced by gamers and critics alike, and recieved several awards for Game of the Year.And now, finally, console gamers can see what all the fuss is about with Half-Life 2's full transition to the XBOX.Picking up an indeterminate number of years after the otherworldly events at the facility at Black Mesa, players once again don the battered crowbar and HazMat suit of sceintist-turned-savior Gordon Freeman. If you've never played any of first game, not to worry. The narrative of HL2 is very much its own beast, and you'll recieve all the info you need about the previous game from various NPCs you meet in and around City 17.Arriving (somehow, you're not quite sure) on a train, you'll immediately notice a sense of dystopian depression in all the people around you. Apparently, an unknown power called the Combine has taken control of the affairs of planet Earth. People are transferred from city to city with no explanation as to why, reproduction is severely prohibited, and \"\"Civil Defense\"\" task forces are everywhere, masked, armored, and spoiling for a fight. In fact, they'll soon be coming after you, and it's only with the help of a small but determined resistance movement that you'll be able to survive.From there, the game introduces you to some old friends and some new ones, a story of struggle, survival, free will, and good old-fashioned heroism. The story is done entirely in-game; no cut-scenes, no cinemas, no breaks in the gameplay at all. The entire story is told while you are physically controlling Gordon, never taking the player out of the world. And during the course of this story as you traverse the world, you'll experience some truly incrediblt things. You'll engage in fierce firefights with squads of Combine troops (who have incredible AI), you'll battle it out with heavily armed vehicles, be hunted by nightmarish creatures, and lead rebels against seemingly-invincible war machines. You'll grow attatched to some characters, and grow to hate others, and all the while you'll constantly be using the world.Which is where the game really excels. The immersion of this game is practically perfect, and it does this in two very important ways. First, video game characters have never been more convincing; Alyx in particular is an incredible achievement, and you'll find yourself accepting that these characters geniunely exist rather than being AI programs and polygons. Secondly, the physics in Half-Life 2 have to seen to be believed. There is literally no other game on the market, first-person or otherwise, that gives the player as much control over their environment. Using the Havok physics engine, HL2 allows the player to do everything from pile bricks on a see-saw and push a swing in a playground to cause bridges to collapse and drop cargo containers on enemies. This makes both the shooting and the puzzles in the game much more fun, much more realistic, and much more rewarding when you use your brain and get creative.For example, in one part of the game you're running through the canals of City 17 being chased by Combine troops, and pass near a bridge where enemies are firing down at you. At this point, all you have is a pistol and a crowbar, and instead of using up valuable ammo trying to take down each Combine soldier individually, you could just hit one of the conveniently placed flammable barrels to bring the whole bridge crashing down.The entire game is full of situations like this that reward creative thinking, and when you pull it off, it looks absolutely beautiful. Not just because the physics are astoundingly convincing, but because the game is just darn good graphically speaking. HL2 is easily one of the best-looking titles on the PC, and while the XBOX version features a couple downgrades on the texture and resolution side of things, it features the same solid frame rate, gorgeous animation, and brilliant art of its PC cousin, and easily stands as one of the best-looking console games of the year.Additionally, while HL2 lost the mouse-keyboard control scheme in the transition to consoles, Valve did a marvelous job of mapping the controls to the XBOX pad. Gordon Freeman isn't as heavy or cumbersome as, say, the Master Chief, and so the controls feel a little light and quick after Halo and Halo 2. However, they feel RIGHT for the game, for the character, and the world, making even the platforming feel fairly polished, and the shooting feel positively divine.And while HL2 for the XBOX is a single-player-only affair, it's deffinitely a world you're going to have an incredible time in. From the rooftops of the city to the dank parlors of Ravenholm, it's also a world you'll probably want to visit over and over again. If you're a fan of first-person shooters, you simply must experience this game.\"", "\"Damn this game was almost perfect.  I mean it was teetering on perfection.  The first twenty minutes of gameplay I spent weeping at its brilliance.One major hang-up.  LOAD TIMES.  I usually don't bitch about load times.  Hell, I played \"\"Morrowind\"\" ritually, and God knows they've mastered the art of allowing you to cook a four-course meal between loading screens.But in Half-Life 2 the load times will actually devastate the pace of the game.  At first I overlooked them, after all it's an immaculate game with graphics that surpass anything seen on the XBOX.Then you get to the airboat, which easily rivals driving the warthog in Halo (die, Halo 2! Die!).  The action is intense and you really honestly feel like you're right there, driving that damn thing.Loading...You're back---you're soaring through the water channel being chased by a helicopter.  You leap a wall of scrap metal and escape the chopper's gunfire into a sewer tunn---Loading...You fly out of the tunnel into the open again, but here comes the helicop---Loading...And it goes on and on and on, until I literally just turned the damn thing off.  I'd already played the level for forty-minutes easily, and every four minutes of gameplay was interrupted by forty-seconds of loading.Loading killed this beautiful, well-imagined game.Damn...\"", "Half Life 2, for x-box, is probably the best looking game x-box will ever put out.  The physics engine is incredible, allowing the player to pick up almost anything and manipulate it.There are only two gripes I have with this game.  First of all, the intro is really . . . really . . . really. . . long.  It was a good twenty minutes or so before I was shooting stuff.That is a minor gripe compared to gripe #2: no multiplayer.  No splitscreen no x-box live, no nuthin'.  Nothing extends the life of a great game like a solid multiplayer experience (e.g. halo and halo 2).Overall, HL2 is a beautiful game with great graphics, gameplay, and intuitive control.  If you've already bought HL2 for PC, there's no reason to buy it for x-box.  But if you haven't, and you're a fan of FPS's, then I think you'll be very please with this title.", "\"Well, I'm a little late as this game has been out for some time now.  So long in fact that you can't even buy the XBox version from Amazon itself, but from others in the Amazon Marketplace (new, used), which is what I did.  I was a little skittish at first to order it in this way, but it worked out very well.  In fact, I may have recieved it sooner than if I had been able to purchase it from Amazon.  The person must have shipped it the very same day.The graphics are really good for an Xbox title.  I also played the PC demo, so I know the graphics on the PC are much better.  One of the problems with having an XBox version is you can't play \"\"Episode 2\"\".  You also can't play multiplayer, it isn't even an option.  I thought it odd it had no multiplayer, then I read in another review that the PC version DOES have multiplayer.A few problems I had with this game were minor.  I'm not sure if it's the XBox controls, or just the game, but I would have trouble many times trying to do something as simple as get through a door.  I'd just get kind of get hung up for no reason that I could see (no clutter around me).  There was a lot of clutter in the game.  Not so much a bad thing, but sometimes it could make a simple task of walking hard as there was always stuff laying around.I also noticed some slow points as the XBox had trouble keeping up with the action.  This isn't a game issue.  In fact, I have a first gen XBox.  You may find a later generation works a little better.There are two driving levels.  I found them to be a pain.  The controls for the vehicles are not very good.  And, they just seem to go forever.  It may have been better if they split them up a bit.  They went on so long I found myself getting dizzy and had to take a break.Some aspects of the game were just amazing.  As much as I'd like to tell you about them, I don't want to spoil anything.  I know I didn't expect them, and it gave me a \"\"WOW!\"\" moment more than once.This isn't a straight up shooter like the Halo  series.  In many places you have to figure out how to get to the next area.  This can be frustrating.  I found myself in a room for about 15 minutes as I swam to the same places I had been to many times trying to figure out what the heck I missed.  And, it's always something really simple that makes you slap yourself on the head.One really nice thing about this game is the length.  I'm not sure how long it took me to beat it, but it was quite a few hours.  This is nice when you think of other games that only have about 7 to 10 hours of gameplay.  It really makes it feel like you got your moneys worth, even if it did only cost 12 bucks...lol\"", "Im sure the lack of multi player (as said) will bother some but i for one think this may be the best game xbox or any other puts out for sometime to come. As a big fan of the original i was wondering if the feel of the game would be the same and yes folks it is. Gordon Freeman is back along with some old and new friends. All of the intensity is there as well as some new enemies. I know everyone has heard how great the graphics are but i must say it....they are the best. Instead of lamenting the fact that there is no multi player, just pick up your crowbar and go on.  As i said, its well worth the wait. Just finished it and the way it ends i would say there will be a HalfLife 3......we can hope.", "\"For those who missed the PC version of \"\"Half-Life 2\"\" (an understandable venture considering Valve's insistence on using their Steam network), the Xbox port is, happily, one of the best shooters available on said console, certainly rivaling \"\"Halo\"\" if not out and out exceeding it. While there are some issues that indicate this was a game designed for PCs first and foremost, it is an otherwise exceptional piece of work that truly captures the feel of the original \"\"Half-Life\"\" while simultaneously ushering it into the new era.You once again assume the role of Gordon Freeman, a tight-lipped scientist apparently more in his element carrying machine guns around than beakers or test tubes. Awakening some time after the Black Mesa incident from game one, he finds himself in City 17 - a futuristic slum, mostly, overlooked by a massive tower and policed by a group known as the Combine. The game is a little too careful not to fill in all the gaps, but suffice it to say that a rebellion is forming to combat the Combine, and Gordon proves to be their reluctant leader. The characters and the aura of City 17 and its surrounding areas are enough to make up for the shortcomings of the story, which despite being vague is still pretty engrossing.The first \"\"Half-Life\"\" is regarded as one of the best games of all time, so Valve wisely chose not to fix something that wasn't broken. True to form, the game never rips you from Gordon Freeman's point of view, choosing instead to convey the story in a realistic fashion devoid of movie style cutscenes. This is perhaps the series' most innovative and immersive feature, and one that has never been replicated as successfully. You truly feel like Gordon Freeman, surrounded by the sights and sounds that are City 17. The game's story appears to flow in real time, so it all just has this cohesive quality that really gives you a sense of being there.The first-person combat is no slouch either. The weapons available all pack quite a punch, and some are truly inspired. The crowbar returns in a nod to the original (and it can certainly come in handy if ammo's scarce), but newcomers like the gravity gun really steal the show. This device is versatile enough to allow you to fling saw blades at approaching zombies or manipulate a stack of crates so that you can build a barricade to protect you from encroaching Combine troops. This is easily the most useful items in the game, as well as one of its selling points. The knockoff in \"\"Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil\"\" can't even hold a candle to it. That said, virtually all of the weapons have their place and are satisfying to use - although the revolver is entirely disposable thanks to its lack of ammo.The enemies can become repetitive - much of the game consists of gunning down same-looking Combine troops and, to a lesser extent, zombies (the product of those headcrabs we all loved so much from the first game). That said, there are still some truly inspiring encounters, such as late game battles with Striders, \"\"War of the Worlds\"\" style tripods that are essentially walking gunships, as well as a new and frightening breed of zombie that runs full speed ahead while shrieking with abandon. It's just too bad there aren't a few more of these foes in the game, as the Combine make up the brunt of what you'll face, and they're not nearly as intelligent or as crafty as the human opponents in the original game. It's reasonable to expect artificial intelligence at least as good as the first game's back in 1998, but, sadly, it's not on display here.In a conceit to games like \"\"Halo\"\" and \"\"Far Cry,\"\" \"\"Half-Life 2\"\" includes a few drivable vehicles, and while these are a nice addition at times, they certainly overstay their welcome. Some portions of the game just run on too long for their own good, but it's an exception rather than the rule. There's usually some new challenge lurking behind every corner, and it provides that rare addictive quality that the first game had in spades. To top it off, the graphics, even stripped to their basics for the Xbox, are quite impressive. Characters are amazingly lifelike, particularly in their facial expressions. Environments are equally charismatic, each one having that sense of being a real place despite the far-fetched nature of the \"\"Half-Life\"\" setting. There's atmosphere to spare. Other first-person games should certainly take notes.The graphics come at a price, however. Unfortunately this port suffers from a sometimes unstable frame rate. It's nothing major, but it can be a little distracting at times. It's certainly the game's chief weakness, but to take a pass on it if you haven't already played the PC version would be a major mistake. This is an awesome game - not \"\"Best Game Ever\"\" material, as some legitimate game reviewers have claimed (see PC Gamer) - but nonetheless a worthy successor to a classic that retains the feel of the original in a way that few next generation sequels can. Highly recommended.\"", "Half-Life 2 was one of the greatest PC games ever to be released.  It was one of the many reasons why I wanted to have a lot of money to shell out onto an awesome gaming computer.  But then Valve announced it would be released on the Xbox, so I waited a little longer.  Was it worth the wait?  Well, I like the fact that I can now play it, but man, I think maybe I should get a better computer to play the PC version.Half-Life is a game that really doesn't sit down and tell you a story, most of it you have to find for yourself.  Example, when the first game came out, you basically had no idea what was really going on other than the fact that an expiriment went bad and now creatures from Xen are traveling to Earth.  To better learn the story, you had to find clues that were, for the most part, hidden from the game.  No cutscenes are given to you because you're in control for most of the game.Anyway, you start off where Gordon Freeman (no not the actor Morgan Freeman) was sent into a portal and told to wait.  Well apparently you've been sleeping for some time now and when you awaken, you enter City 17 where humanity is run by the Combine.  You meet up with people from the first game then it kicks into high gear.Gameplay is some of the best I've ever seen.  When shooting gets old, they add some new twist, giving you a boat to drive or a car.  The other neat feature is the Havok engine, which uses the force of gravity.  You'd be amazed at how much you can manipulate your environment, in fact a lot of puzzles require you to do so.  You even get a gravity beam to use on other objects.  I really love this concept.  The other thing is that you have team mates that really think for themselves.  Which also brings me to the enemies, they are much smarter and will group up if they can't bring you down alone.So where does the Xbox version fall, if I like it so much?  Well, if you look closely at the character models in this version compared to the PC, you'll see a bigger difference, they're not as blocky.  Also the loading times are a pain, I understand that this is a big game, but I really hate how it constantly has to stop and load.  Pick this up if you need a great shooter and don't have a quality gaming computer"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.005925776902586222, 0.1493542492389679, 0.17937308549880981, 0.07345722615718842, 0.06667797267436981, 0.2930775582790375, 0.19324471056461334, 0.009538781829178333, 0.029350703582167625]]}
