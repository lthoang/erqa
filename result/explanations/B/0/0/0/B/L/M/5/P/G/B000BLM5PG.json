What I really enjoy is playing online.  That is where the real fun exists.  Playing battles against eleven others makes it a lot of fun especially with the live experience.  That is why my rating is higher than what it should be.  Without online I would only give this game three stars.", "\"Saints Row is an online-enabled Grand Theft Auto, with a \"\"hardcore gansta\"\" body kit.For the most part, it's a decent game. There's definitely some quality gameplay inside this box.  I especially enjoy the highly customisable character appearance.A few gameplay innovations address some of the complaints GTA received, and there were also some interesting new mingames but I didn't find anything truly revolutionary to warrant all the hype this game received.In fact, for every innovation that added to this game there seemed to be a glitch that detracted.  My favourite, the \"\"Where did my car go?\"\" glitch, causes your vehicle to disappear for no apparent reason. When this happens, your character comes to an abrupt halt, stuck in mid air. I could find no way to begin moving again or exit the \"\"missing\"\" vehicle. This particular glitch repeated itself every time I attempted one particular mission, rendering the game completely unplayable from that point forward.Even though there were some fun minigames, I found the \"\"Respect\"\" system caused them to become quite repetitive. In order to progress with the story you need \"\"respect\"\".  In order to get respect, you must complete side job after side job ad infinitum.  While fun the first few times, they get old fast. Good concept, poor execution.Still, for its faults there are enough enjoyable qualities to make this game worth playing- just not enough to live up to the hype.Pros:-Beautiful scenery-Highly customisable character-Celebrity voice oversCons:-Glitches/bugs-Rep...rep...repetitive-Too much distance/driving between every point A and point B\"", "Isn't fun. The characters are corny and stupid. It's dumb. It's not fun. It's just a clone of Grand Theft Auto. It's got slow down issues. It's basically the same open sandbox game as GTA but it doesn't have the comedy or satire of GTA. Dumb. I spent $60.00 for it played it for a couple of hours and never played it again. I sold it a week later. Dumb game.", "This game is really fun to play, tons of action and things to do. Really similar to GTA:San Andreas. The ending is terrible and confusing. Doing activities between missions in order to gain respect gets old after a while a frustrating. Not many options when creating, dressing or customizing your character.", "\"Grand Theft Auto, like it or not, should be credited as one of the most important video games in the last decade. It created a genre, reinvented several others, and for better and worse put video games out in front of a bigger audience than ever before. Not the first developer to attempt to imitate this formula, the Champaign, Illinois-based Volition has created Saint's Row, another game with high hopes of giving Rockstar's bad-mouthed baby a run for its money. It does this better than any game before it and ends up as one of the best titles on the Xbox 360.So many sandbox games have been done before and one might wonder just what Saint's Row does to be unique. What's new here that wasn't in Grand Theft Auto, True Crime, Driver or The Godfather? Well, fundamentally, nothing. You've driven cars, done drive-bys, taken out gangs, run over pedestrians, and rode shotgun-why do it all again in a $60 Xbox 360 game? Well, despite the fact that Saint's Row takes you down several familiar roads, it does everything Grand Theft Auto and its imitators did, but a lot better.Saint's Row throws you into a city called Stilwater. In the wrong place at the wrong time, you're the sole survivor of a brutal gang scuffle. You're rescued by Julius, the leader of the Saints, a lesser-known gang in Stilwater. With nothing else to do, you embark on a bloody journey with the Saints to claim Stilwater as their own. It's an all-out territory war between the business-savvy Vice Kings, the gearhead Westside Rollerz, and the drug-dealing Carnales.Saint's Row has a story that's worth listening to. The different lieutenants of the Saints are all colorful characters indeed, and their enemies for each gang are equally interesting. The story isn't an all-out win for anyone, with tragic losses, betrayals, and more for each warring faction. An interesting choice was to keep the main character silent except for a few interesting times throughout the violent campaign-and when the man finally talks, it's always something that'll catch you off-guard. I especially enjoyed his quip during the final Vice Kings mission.Before I get to the open-world things you can find in Saint's Row, I'll explain the mission structure. Unlike other games, where completing story-based missions allows you to continue onto more missions, Saint's Row forces you to earn respect points. These points are a reward earned by \"\"spreading the word\"\" and causing havoc throughout Stilwater in the name of the Saints. This is done by taking part in various Activities, like playing the pimp in \"\"Snatch,\"\" the chauffeur in \"\"Escort,\"\" shooting everything in sight in \"\"Mayhem,\"\" or slowly taking out targets in \"\"Hitman.\"\" Once enough respect points are earned, the player can continue through the story. Not only does this system nudge the player to explore Stilwater and play the game at a less-focused, slower pace, it allows the player to see all of the different gameplay concepts found in the game.As I mentioned, Saint's Row is a story about a territory war, so a large percentage of your time will be devoted to earning 36 different sectors in Stilwater and defending them from the three opposing gangs. These territories are unlocked naturally throughout each gang's storyline, so you'll take over the west side of Stilwater before you're done with the Rollerz, win the south while fighting the Carnales, and raise your flags in the downtown area during your conquest against the Vice Kings. After winning territories, you'll occasionally have to defend them against the old owners. This is done in a way that seems random, so sometimes you'll be cruising along and receive an in-game message that your territory is being attacked. It's not mandatory to fight back for the territory, but it helps greatly when you have to drive through that territory and you don't have to worry about being shot at.On top of the game's 36 story-based missions and the 36 territories, there are Stronghold missions that also help in the territory take-over. When you've earned additional respect points, you'll sometimes be able to take over an enemy Stronghold. Stronghold missions, alongside the Activities, are my favorite part of Saint's Row. These are generally all-out assaults on an enemy base that is filled to the brim with angry defenders armed with bigger guns. There are some Stronghold missions that play things differently. For example, while taking over one Carnales Stronghold, you'll do a little demolition by planting bombs throughout a factory. Sadly, Stronghold missions don't come around as often as I'd have hoped-I would have loved to see a Stronghold in every single sector of the city.I can't go much longer without crediting Volition for giving Saint's Row a typical first-person shooter control scheme. Unlike the abysmal \"\"lock-on and shoot\"\" style of Grand Theft Auto, Saint's Row plays very smoothly in every way. Running around and aiming your weapons are both controlled by the analog sticks, and there isn't even a lock-on button to be found. If you're a fan of first-person shooters (if you've got an Xbox 360, you probably are), you'll feel right at home with this style. Fortunately, shooting isn't the only thing that's really easy to do. The cars in Saint's Row all feel very stable and controllable, which I strongly prefer to the buck-wild vehicles found in Grand Theft Auto. It doesn't matter if you're driving an old beater, a high-end sports car, or a delivery truck, the controls never become a frustrating issue. That's more than Grand Theft Auto could ever claim.There are some gameplay touches that fans of this genre should be very happy with. Volition made this a peoples' game by toning down the backtracking and retracing of the steps-if you're taken out in a mission, you have the option to restart the mission from its beginning with everything you had prior to the mission. This is a simple and small touch, but it's one that I'm personally very fond of when I think back to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and I remember driving for several combined hours to retry missions at their starting point. Also, throughout the game, there are a ton of save points. Capturing an enemy stronghold or crib will spawn another save point location, so by the end of the game, there will be more than two dozen save points across the city. Add the ability to save anywhere on the fly, and you've got a very easily accessible game.Saint's Row runs on all four cylinders in terms of presentation. The visuals are fantastic, spare for a few genre-familiar problems (pop-up, bad draw distance, etc.). The overall look of the game is very bright and colorful, giving a rather comical appearance to a very brutal game. There are so many little touches that make this game look smooth. For example, your characters will hop into the seats of a convertible rather than open the doors to slowly get in. The particle effects and physics engine are definitely the highlights, though. After blowing up cars, you're treated to some of the best explosions ever seen in video games. Don't gawk too long, though, because the debris will eventually come crashing down, crush your body, and then burn it to a crisp if you manage to survive!The sound is fantastic in every way. The radio stations don't rival those of Grand Theft Auto but they're still entertaining. The sound effects are great as well. But what has to be credited the most is the dialogue. Saint's Row features the most ridiculous but excellent dialogue I've seen from a game like this. There are a few too many f- and n-bombs for my taste, but in the actual story scenes, the dialogue is believable and well-done. Some of the other dialogue is so raunchy that you'll definitely want to keep any kids away. During some of the Escort Activity missions, I heard the most perverse sexual things I think I've ever heard in my life. Still, this is a game you'll want to listen to-keep that Xbox 360 Soundtrack turned off!The raunchy dialogue is accompanied by a generally sick sense of humor that mimics that of Rockstar very well. Volition pokes fun at several different things in this game, and you'll catch a lot of them in no time. For example, a common one is the \"\"grown-up, mature\"\" version of the late Dave Thomas's Midwest-based food chain, Wendy's. The commercials heard in the game are pretty ridiculous. Friendly Fire, Stilwater's firearm store, is a complete rip-off of Ammu-Nation, Grand Theft Auto's equivalent. The commercials make this especially noticeable.Saint's Row's online gameplay is something that has never been attempted before in the sandbox genre. Online, you can choose from several gameplay modes. The online gameplay modes are all a lot of fun when the connection isn't awful, but in my experience, the connection was almost always awful, so I didn't have the most fun on Xbox Live with this game. There was severe lag, a ton of disconnecting, and a lot of quitters. Also, I felt like the characters died and ran out of stamina far too quickly. Rather than being a fast-paced game where players were free to run around, the lack of stamina made everything a much slower affair. Still, there's a lot of potential whenever the servers are more stable. The Gang setup (basically the exact same concept as Halo 2's clans) is great, and the lobbies are fun, letting you cap and chat with your buddies while waiting on the game to load.Overall, Saint's Row isn't without its problems-frustrating missions, choppy online play, and a few graphical glitches show that Saint's Row is human. Add those to the familiar ground tread in the game's storyline, and the lack of some of GTA's newer features, and you've got a game that is a few years behind the competition. But does that mean that Saint's Row is bad? No! Far from it! Saint's Row is a fantastic game that had me glued to my seat. I was so glued, in fact, that I played it for more than ten hours after putting it into my Xbox 360 for the first time, completing more than 30% of the game in a single sitting. Then the next day came and went. And the next day. And the next day. Saint's Row's got the great graphics, excellent presentation, control style, online gameplay, and entertainment value to make it more than worthy of your $60.\"", "this game is really fun its way better than gta cause all the gta games are really the samething different story but samething but this game is hot you can custom mize your character the picture is not small like gta you can recruit your friends to join the fun and you can go in stores and rob banks you could'nt do that with gta. And theirs much more in this game and the grapic is amazing gta 5 better have something up their sleeves cause not than this rules gta history.", "forget that this piece of garbage is a GTA clone for a moment...it doesn't even work...it has frozen on me 4 times in a row...unable to get pat 5% of completion due to freezes...inexcusable for a piece of trash that has been out this long to do this...", "This game is awesome! Need I say more? You know the plot and you know the stunts. Great Game, HIGHLY RECOMENDED!", "\"Fans demanded Volition to port Saints Row 1 to PS3 and PC, but they said \"\"NO\"\"! They said,\"\"It will remain an Xbox 360 exclusive.\"\" So I had no choice but to buy an xbox 360 for this game. It's not fair that the first game is an xbox exclusive and the sequels are multiplatform! People who have not played the first game due to the fact they may not have a 360 will probably not get the whole story or origins of the main character. But I'm not here to completely rant about that. I'm here to review the game itself. Saints Row 1 is a good start to the series. This is where the main character started in Saints Row, with nothing, then got an opportunity to join the Third Street Saints gang and take over Stilwater, a fictional city based on Detroit (I think). Customization is nice as well. The downside is your character can only be a guy and doesn't have much dialogue in the first game. If Volition could remake Saints Row 1 with some extra tweaks, like improved graphics, more customization, etc., then that would be a treat. It would be a great idea to do that for next gen consoles. Now I know what you're thinking, I bought an Xbox 360 for one game and know next gen consoles are not long from release? The answer is no because there are other exclusives I want to try on this console. But before I do that, My rating for Saints Row 1 is a 3.5/5. Not much to say since it released in 2006. I said before, it would be a treat if Volition had the will to remake Saints Row 1 for next gen (PS4 and Xbox One). Until that day, that's all I have to say for this game.\"", "\"This is really getting to be absurd. If I could travel back in time a few years and tell myself \"\"Guess what? In 2011, you finally give in and play the GTA series... and you end up really loving it,\"\" my younger self would probably laugh and call me a liar. If I then went on to say \"\"And then in 2012, you love GTA so much that you even play some of the really blatant rip-offs, such as the wannabe urban gangsta thuggery pastiche that is Saints Row,\"\" my younger self would kick me in the nuts and demand that I take back this outrageously heinous insult.Yet it's true. After falling madly in love with GTA last summer (and replaying GTA IV several times in the ensuing months) suddenly games like Saints Row The Third are no longer so easy to ignore. It looks pretty fun, and I want to try it. However, anybody who knows me knows that I'm usually too anal retentive to play the third game in a series first, without having played the previous two beforehand. Therefore, last week I went ahead and scored myself a copy of the original Saints Row.Perhaps it would have been different if I had played this game in 2006, and also if I had played GTA San Andreas in 2004. Maybe then I would have been able to overlook SR1's cleaner (read: sterile, plastic looking) graphics and whatnot. Playing it five years after the fact, all I see is a shoddy, unpolished, incredibly derivative game. It's as if they hired a 13 year old GTA San Andreas fanboy to design a game and his 8th grade classmates were the development team. It often times literally looks like a beta, awaiting texture map implementation. Cars and NPCs fade in and out of existence right in front of you. The best I can say is that some of the activities were genuinely fun, or at least funny. e.g. Riding shotgun for the suburban soccer-mom drug dealer and listening to her comments. [kills pursing policeman w/ head shot] \"\"Oh my! Is it really OK to do that? Well, I'm sure he had life insurance.\"\" [plows over a pedestrian] \"\"Whoopsie-doodle!\"\" One of the worst aspects of the game is that in order to play through the \"\"story\"\" missions, you are forced to unlock them by earning respect points in the various side mission activities. Towards the end of the game, these have been boiled down to the most boring/least enjoyable. Kinda steps on the fun's toes.In fairness, I'm probably barking up the wrong tree here. I see the GTA fanbase being basically divided into two groups: A) those who generally ignore most of the missions and instead unlock weapons via cheat codes and go around causing random mayhem, and B) those who prefer to methodically progress through the game mission by mission until they finish it. Seems to me Saints Row was designed to appeal to group A, whereas I happen to be a staunch member of group B. I eventually learned that the most efficient way to acquire the best weapons and ammo is to intentionally bait the cops until you have full five star wanted level, and then farm them for their dropped weapons. It's shockingly easy to survive this for an indefinite length of time, and wander over to a \"\"Forgive & Forget\"\" booth when you've had enough. In a GTA game, surviving this would generally require cheat codes.EDIT: I completed this game last night and in the end, I must admit I had fun with it and I don't regret buying/playing it. I just bumped my up rating by one star. Minutes later was playing Saints Row 2. After about three hours of it, I can safely say it's basically more of the same, but higher quality. Much more polished, on par with current gen games from its day. I spent approx. 10 minutes in the character creation system's Default Facial Expression menu, just going down the list over and over, laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.\"", "\"The game Saints Row tells the epic tale of one gang called the Saints as they battle rival gangs to become the rulers of the city Stilwater.It starts off letting you customize your character - anything from nose size and hair to muscle definition and weight. From there you're allowed to run around, punch & kick enemies & civilians, hijack or buy and customize cars, spray paint walls, buy clothes and jewlery, purchase guns (and boy is there a wide variety of guns such as RPGs, handguns, shotguns, grenades, etc.) , buy CDs, call up your homies to fight along side you, and MUCH more. In order to do missions you have to earn respect. To gain respect you can do \"\"activities\"\" scattered throughout Stilwater such as snatching hookers away from their pimps, protecting drug dealers as they do their things, race, participate in demolition derbies, steal cars for stores, kill rival gang members, and many more. Also, if you wear a lot of purple (the Saints' color of choice) you can gain extra bonus points.The missions themselves are BRUTALLY fun (with the exception of maybe 3). They go from destroying planes, storming mansions, robbing cars, blowing up buildings, rescuing people... its all really fun, and your rewarded with viscerally appealing and cool sounding cutscenes afterwards.To earn money you can rob stores (eitrher by holding them up or by opening the safe yourself), beat up people and take their money, do the activities I mentioned, or beat missions. The more money you have, the more things you can buy.Also, as you take over enemy turfs for your own they will do these things called \"\"push backs\"\" on random areas. This is when rival gangs try to take back their lands, and its basically an all out war between the Saints and the enemies until you kill the red highlighted lieutenants scattered throughout the territory. Once thats done, you can resume your game. Also owning more territories gives you more money each day... by the time I beat the game I hasd about $8 grand coming to me each day.Moving on, this game has an EXCELLENT sound track. There is something like 100 songs from different genres such as hip hop, rock, and classical to listen to and many of them are really catchy. They even have some big namers on it like Xzibit, Wu-Tang, Winger, and Fall Out Boy (but I dislike FOB). Ontop of that, if you have a hard drive for your system you can upload your own songs into the game which is great. The sound effects are really top notch - like the guns shooting and things blowing up. Additionally, the voice acting is superb as well. Everyone portrays personality through curses, crude humor, and anger.. not to mention THQ also got some big times to do some acting such as the guy who plays Goliath from the Gargoyles and the girl Jackie from \"\"That 70's Show\"\".The graphics are great in Saints Row. Everyone looks lifelike, and the city looks so realistic. The weather changes from sunny to rainy, night to day... its breathtaking. The cars look AMAZING, be it really new and shiny to old and rusty, everything has an authentic feel to it. Easily better looking then Grand Theft Auto.But like always, no game comes without faults. For starters, the weapon selection screen is hard to get down and sometimes when you choose a weapon it wont exactly change to that weapon. Ontop of that, shooting while driving is a nightmare. The ally AI is sometimes incredibly dumb and when you want them to get into a car with you they will just stand there. Finally, the ending was terrible - you kill the last guy and take over Saints Row. Julius, who is the head of the Saints, tells you he still thinks something is amiss and that you're his right hand man now. Then they show you cocking a pistol and overlooking a crew of your boys. Then this mission called the \"\"3rd Street Saints\"\" mission opens up where you have to take a bus and destroy it, and when thats complete you, Dex, and Gat have to blow up like 5 police cars... evntually you meet with a guy running for mayor and he says \"\"thank you but I have to kill you\"\". He proceeds to surround you with like 50 of his goons, then the ship blows up. Uh huh..To sum it up, Saints Row is a MUST HAVE for X-Box 360 owners or people who enjoy GTA-like games. There so much to do, and its so fun to do it that you just have to own this game.\"", "\"Are you really to get your hands dirty Player? Then welcome to Stilwater, an arguable sister city to Liberty City with all of the same problems and more ways to cause trouble. Saint's Row is a blatant rip off of Grand Theft Auto and it is a good one at that. With only a few minor game play tweaks both games are fundamentally the same.A wannabe gangster in a gang infested neighborhood called \"\"The Row,\"\" gets caught in the middle of three way gun battle before being rescued in by the local neighborhood gang Saints, your quickly recruited into the gang  and help the Saints take back the neighborhood and the rest of the city.A lot like GTA 3's `Claude', you are a nameless character who is only referred to as Player, and like Claude you work your way from the bottom back up to the top, not once, but tree times against three different gangs. However you can't just hop from one main story mission to the next, you must earn respect buy doing various side missions like snatching up street walkers from rival games, stealing cars, hijacking various shipments, and driving around VIPs with their dates.The GTA and Saints Row have are classified as \"\"Free Roaming\"\" i.e. you can freely wonder around the game world. But GTA is not a true a true free roamer because area's of the map are locked off and you don't have full accesses to some the items that are used, i.e. all the guns. But In Saint's Row you can explore the whole map and, if you have the money, stock up on RPGs and assault rifles all before the first mission.Tips: Focus on one gang, once you defeat them you will get a new crib will you will be able to gather your cash and get free weapons.When performing break ins, park your car behind the building if it has a back door, cause if you take too long unlocking the safe the cops will just club you as soon as you walk out the door.\"", "This is basically a Grand Theft Auto clone, but MUCH more advanced than GRA. The graphics are super-cool as par for the 360 machine. There's tons of stuff to do in the game. The main storyline is decent and there are plenty of jobs to do on the side to keep you busy. There's also a heavy racing element in the game aside from the obvious shooting/thuggery. The amount of customization you can do for not only your character but your cars is just downright amazing. The car customization screen is really a game in itself.Sample act ivies include stealing a large list of cars for chop shops, snatching hookers from rival pimps, enforcement for dope dealers to make sure they don't get caught and driving around town with a hooker and her high-profile client in the backseat while trying to avoid the news crews in vans. That's not including the multitude of missions where you smoke rival gangs to gain domination over the city. There is ALWAYS something cool to do and you can choose whatever activity sounds good at the time.There is little to no nudity but the suggestive themes leave little to the imagination. Obviously this isn't a game for the kiddos. I would say 18 and up personally.On release the online play is VERY laggy... and i do mean VERY. The game modes available online are very promising. You have the same customization options for your online character as you do for your story mode character. I expect future patches for the game will fix the lag issues. Once that's taken care of the online play will be as cool as story mode.The only reason I'm giving the game a 4 overall is because of the lagg issue online. Once that's fixed it'll be a 5 star game all around.I've put in about 30 hours into the game so far and I'm only listed as 25% complete.", "how can i explain what makes it a little better the GTA... well imagine any thing that annoyed you in GTA or any problem that needed fixing and you will find it in this game, for one thing its easier then GTA, so many things you discover that are new even if you had it for a while, i have a feeling this game will disapear and fall in sales when GTA for PS3 comes out but hey thats not for a long long time, yes more delays from Sonywhat i love about this game is when the cops come to your hood and you entire gang starts shooting at them, also unlike GTA when the cops arrest you and you come out you still have your wepons!!!!", "I don't think I have laughed this much in years!  While the game is 'violent' there is a lot of humor in it as well.  From a variety of cutscenes to the absolutely insane Insurance Fraud missions, this game has a lot of humor and enjoyment.While I'm a pretty big fan of the GTA series, I actually believe I might like this game a little bit better.  That being said, we'll see what the newest GTA installment adds.  Like the previous reviews have mentioned a lot of the painful tasks are gone and you can just run around and enjoy this one. No more eating to keep your stomach happy. (Please! I have to do that in real life...)  Save any time, anywhere.  It will simply load you up at the closest save point the next time you jump into the game.This is more like a free form city with tons of minigames.  I've spent 10 hours so far just running around doing minigames and 1 or 2 of the main quests missions!If your a fan of GTA this is a must buy and if your not this one isn't nearly as intimidating as GTA.  Give it a rental try and see how fun it is.  Totally addicting!", "This isn't the greatest game ever.  However, if you feel like playing GTA on your 360, and don't want to play your old GTA games, then Saints Row might be for you.I can't emphasize this enough, it is JUST a GTA clone.  If you don't like GTA, you aren't going to like this game.  If you are expecting something more than GTA, you aren't going to like this game.  But if you play it and expect it to be GTA with slightly better graphics, you'll have a good time.", "I never been a fan of GTA. In my opinion I think all the GTA game's are the same. But Saint's row is Classic. This game by itself beat's the whole GTA series. This game is not repitive like GTA, and you can customize your character and recruit gang's on your side and let them join the fun. I love how you can customize your character and smoke and drink. That's really cool. This game is Awsome.", "The game has a few fun points but overall the fun-ness wears off fast. It gets really old really fast doing the same stupid quests over and over.", "\"If you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto, then you should definitely check out Saints Row. This GTA style game features the gang attacks, carjacking and other mature fun that can be played for months.Let me first make it clear that this was never intended to be a game for kids. There is a TON of hard core swearing, and it is pretty much constant. Even walking the streets gets you baragged with swearing. Your missions involve driving prostitutes around and listening to them \"\"at work\"\", helping drug dealers make their rounds, bashing up gang members in very violent ways, and so on. This is very clearly aimed towards a mature market, the kind that loves to watch The Sopranos and Scarface.That being said, Saint's Row provides extremely fun escapist fantasy for those who enjoy those worlds. The graphics quality is extremely impressive. You get day-night cycles, and the sunset with the twinkling stars is gorgeous. Each area of your city has its own personality. You can really enjoy walking along the chinatown waterfront in the early morning. The cars have fun touches like spinning wheel add-ons.Many things that were annoying about the Grand Theft Auto series are fixed here. I like the aiming system much better, I like how it saves and how it handles death in missions. Most of the minigames are quite fun and ramp up in difficulty at a reasonable rate. For example you can - right from the start - do a ton of \"\"Insurance Fraud\"\" missions and get just about as much money as you could possibly want, and respect as well.Even the basic character customization is impressive. You can be caucasian, African-American, hispanic, or asian - with a lot of details on each type. Yes, you can only be a guy. Someday they'll let girls into these games, in a way other than a prostitute! The hair, tattoo, body piercings, clothing, etc. choices are pretty impressive.The voice acting is stellar. You get David Carradine, Keith David, Michael Clarke Duncan, Tia Carrere, and much more. It really helps you to get involved in the storyline.  The story is sometimes predictable, but heck, this is a gang story. Of course you know that your gang will gain power while you defeat the others. It wouldn't be much of a game if your gang was destroyed quickly :)There are of course a few things they could have done better. There aren't motorcycles. There are a few strange glitches - like when you're hit by a car sometimes and fly up, it teleports you to a train station. The game has frozen once or twice but it seems to be after full-day gaming marathons, so it could easily be the XBox having a temporary meltdown. The cars don't seem to be affected much by damage.In general, this is amazingly fun to play, the world is simply fun to \"\"be in\"\" with its graphics and details, and there are always new things to do.Highly, highly recommended for a mature gamer.\"", "He played this over his Aunts house and liked it. He watched the trailer for Saints Row 2 and decided he wants to play both and likes them better than the newer Grand Theft Auto games.", "this game was the reason i purchased an xbox 360 in 2007 and in my opinion, is the best game in the series as of right now. before all the wacky antics of the the latter installments, there was Saints Row: a game built around gang violence and comedy. even today, this game has great graphics, great clothing and car customization, an awesome and varied selection of music, EATING FAST FOOD and a great cast of characters. the storyline itself is Solid with lots of main and side missions to keep you busy for a while...but when your not on a mission, just cruising around listening to music, customizing your car and hanging out in the hood as your homies shoot it out with opposing gang members is where this game just shines most. people compare this game alot to GTA San Andreas....and there are some similarities ofcourse....but this game is a completely different monster all together. if youre collecting Xbox Originals or are just curious about the game that started it all, pick this up and add it to your collection, its well worth it.", "\"Saint's Row is a game that is a blantant rip-off of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, from everything right down to the way you steal cars out from people driving them on the street. But make no mistake: This isn't some rushed piece of garbage simply set out to make money off the GTA franchise. It has a little bit of TLC put into it by the game developers, as well.Similarities to GTA:-You can do storyline and free roaming missions-steal and customize cars-participate in Turf Wars taking over neighborhoods for your gang-customize your main character-wield a large variety of guns-listen to a large variety of music-and generally play the game however way you want.Enhancements over GTA:-Much superior graphics-better map-a GPS system for your maps and vehicles-customizable cell phone, with allies you can call for backup-customizable music playlists (in case you get sick of the randomness of the radio stations and want to hear your music anywhere, anytime)-the hands-down BEST car customization in any non-racing video game, ever!-health items (food) you can access anytime-self-regenerating health that heals up from about-to-die to full health in about one minute or so-superior firearms (albeit none of them look very unique)-a slightly better menu interface to access your firearms (I just wish they hadn't put the food and weapons in the same system; it gets confusing)-the police are the most minor threat in the game-public transportation is available to you (although you more than likely will never use it)-if you find yourself stuck in water, you can skip having to swim to shore with the \"\"warp\"\" feature, which will do that for you. Pretty cool feature! Why aren't things like that in other games?-shooting style & difficulity are fair (The shot target is in the fixed-center of the screen and you move the camera to aim, but it's a little harder to use then in GTA)-both men, AND women, can be recruited as allies in your gang, or killed in other gangs. Hurray for murder equality!-celebrity voice acting (I instantly recognized Mila Kunis as Tanya and Michael Rapaport as Troy)Worse from GTA:-No bikes or motorcycles to ride which is diaspointing-no boats or planes either (not that they're really needed here)-character can barely swim-only one safehouse in the entire city/game-clothes choices are lame and uninspired-despite the good voice acting, the dialogue is terrible and it sounds like it was written by the whitest people on the planet (shades of \"\"187: Ride or Die\"\")-an excessive overuse of cursing (if you're going to use it in every other word, it's impact and gravitas is completely lost)-the A.I. is stupid, and the enemy gangs have that \"\"random spawning\"\" effect whenever you have a \"\"wanted level\"\" by them-it's mandatory to do the side missions as you have to earn \"\"respect\"\" in order to do the main storyline missions, and respect is only gained from the side missions-many of the side missions are hard or just plain annoying, like the later level Escort missions-your character, although he has great stamina, has terrible running animation, and trying to shoot while running just looks retarded.-the prices of things are way too high/too much (if you're just staring off and haven't saved up any cash, a fifty dollar hamburger may be a bit much). I'd prefer them if they kept them at \"\"real-world\"\" prices.-the \"\"humor\"\" of the game is just weak and lacks any level of subtlety whatsoever, like the Wendy's burger chain parody, \"\"Freckle B*tch's\"\" for example-the radio stations are horribly put together, and their names are awful, too.-the music is generic and lame, and there's only a few \"\"name brand\"\" artists contributing to the game's soundtrack. Mainly, the Clipse and Twista.-there's no difficulity setting and the main missions in the game are a bit too easy (while the side missions are often too hard)-the \"\"escape the police\"\" method in this game is weak and lame. It's a drive-thru confessional booth, not that you'll ever really need to use it. I never even been in \"\"Forgive and Forget\"\" before.-your recruited allies are complete idiots and you'll spend more time than anything reviving them because they rushed headlong into a dozen or so shooting enemies. They're more of a hassle to use than any kind of help, sort of like bringing young children along for grocery shopping.-it's pretty easy to die in situations that don't call for it. Your health bar, despite it's regeneration, can't take much damage and a few shots from two or more enemies can take you from full health to death pretty quickly. Like, in three seconds quickly. This is darn frustrating and happens A LOT in the stupid Pushback missions that pop up randomally that you can't avoid skipping over.-there's NO Body Armor, anywhere in this game, which only adds on to the annoying \"\"easy to die\"\" problem I mentioned above.-the randomally popping up, mandatory \"\"defend your turf against invading gangs\"\" Pushback Missions. They were just as random and annoying in San Andreas and they're even more annoying here. What's worse is, in order to successfully defend your turf, you'll have to seek out special \"\"lieutenants\"\" instead of just killing everybody in sight. And these 12 or so lieutenants tend to hide out in weird, hard-to-reach places, and you'll have to make your way through dozens of enemies, risking your life, just to make your way to them. It was easier in GTA when you just had to kill everybody invading your land. Here, you'll literally be in an urban battlefield going against dozens of enemies, making your way to one of the four spots in the area your enemy lieutenats are at. (they only hang out three at a time and are scattered wide across the entire neighborhood warzone.) The worse thing about these missions are that they're more or less mandatory, and you won't have time to save whenever they pop up, and they'll pop up often after JUST completing a really hard mission or side quest. At least in San Andreas, it was fun to do these missions, partly because they were do in intervals and all you had to do is be the last man standing. Here, they're just a REALLY annoying chore.-each gun has it's own set of bullets, making it hard to get ammo. In other games like GTA, bullets are shared between guns of similar types (universal pistol ammo, universal shotgun ammo, etc.), but here, each gun is different with it's own unique bullets in them, and you can only have one gun type (pistol, shotgun, etc.) at a time. BUT, because you can't use ammo from other guns, that you'll often find off of dead bodies, you'll constantly be having to decide whether to swap your gun that's low on ammo out for the one of a gang member you just shot. If so, you'll quickly run of of ammo for that, too. If not, you'll just have an empty gun on you. And thus, you'll be deciding which gun you have that is more fuel efficent, quite often in heavily heated turf wars or in missions with tons of enemies to kill. What's worse is every single gangster carries different random guns on them. If the Vice Kings just all had Vice pistols and the Carnales had a different pistol type they all shared, it'd be a lot simplier. But, no, every time you kill someone, it's \"\"do I run out of ammo, or pick this up instead, even though it only has five more bullets in it than the one I already have?\"\" Basically, you'll easily use up all the ammo for whichever gun you have and will have to replace it for another gun (which only has a few bullets in it) and back and fourth like so. (In other words: YOU'RE *ALWAYS* RUNNING OUT OF AMMO!)Overall, Saint's Row is a worthy edition to the GTA genre of video games. Although it's a rip-off, in every sense of the word, it's defintely not of inferior quality.  In fact, Saint's Row is even better than most of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The game, at it's core is nice, but what really bogs it down are the minor negatives, which as you can see, really begin to add up. The game is much better than Three Stars, but all these little things keep it from being Five Star worthy. Other than the numerous minor flaws, the only problem is the story, which is pretty lame and generic, and the script, which is just laughably cheesy in it's attempt to sound \"\"urban\"\" or \"\"gangsta\"\" or \"\"hip hop\"\" or whatever. San Andreas' dialogue and script felt 100% genuine. Saint's Rows, however, sounds forced, like they were too lazy to do their research and just decided to \"\"wing it.\"\"It would be easy to just make a Grand Theft Auto clone that's pretty bad (True Crime has proved that, for us). It would also be pretty easy to try to make your own game, using many of the famous GTA elements involved (I.E, CrackDown). But Saint's Row, however, is a true Grand Theft Auto imitation, that manages not to photocopy the game, but use it as a worthy starting off point for their own series. I like mostly everything in this game, and the only real things keeping it from being superior to every GTA game ever made on the older consoles, is it's cheesy dialogue, numerous small annoyances, it's and cheesy writing, and lame attempts to be \"\"funny.\"\"Other than that, Saint's Row is a worthy duplication of the \"\"sandbox shooting and driving\"\" genre created by GTA itself, and it definitely deserves to be played, even if only as a week-long rental, by ANY Grand Theft Auto fan.\"", "Saints Row - Circa 2006GOOD:- Great Graphics and physics make the game come to life.- Shooting works efficiently and easily, Shooting is more like that of a Third Person Shooter (like Lost Planet on Xbox 360)- Online gameplay either with or against other people, with modes like versus/team play ect...BAD:- Plot is considered pretty weak to many.- Voice acting maybe good, but most dialog feels like a forced/fake attempt to seem hip-hop urban.- No Motorcycles, Boats, or helicopters (only the police get helicopters).- Game might seem like too much of a Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas rip-off for some.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A go anywhere do anything at any time type of game that we have seen in such games as Grand Theft Auto. You're a new Gang member in an up and coming gang and it's your job to help stop (kill off) other rival gangs.- Much like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (on Xbox 360, PS3, PC) you can customize your own character with things like Race/Hair styles/and setting the positions or types of things like eyes, nose, mouth ect. Also you can go back anytime and change these attributes (at the plastic surgeon for body and face and Barber for new hair types or styles). On top of all that you have many different clothing options/styles/types to choose from different clothing stores.- GPS type map lets you put markers on the map and the CPU will map out (using a dotted line to your goal) the best/fastest route to get there.- Lots of Car customizing to be had. Also note your garage can hold over 50 cars (which can be accessed by a scrolling menu). Also once a car is added to your garage its saved their so if you lose your car it will show up in your garage (in the same state you left it in), and if you destroy your car you can get a brand new one from your garage (for a small price).- Pick and use weapons/health ups from a click wheel (like Turok 2 form N64 had), this makes switch weapons fast and easy. Also you don't lose weapons after you die.- If you fall into water in the world of Saints Row you can swim, but you can also warp to the shore saving time and effort.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (PS2/Xbox/PC)- The Godfather: The Game (Xbox/PS2/Xbox 360)- CrackDown (Xbox 360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is already new content out for download for this game (most of which is free) via Xbox-Live. One pack gives you a Santa Suit.- Reportedly this game is also coming to Sony's Playstation Three.", "This is not some cheap thrown together clone of GTA .. at all. In fact the boys at Rockstar/Take2 can learn a lot from this game. Lots and lots of fun .. the missions were just the right difficulty .. I have no complaints whatsoever. A quality title.", "Saints Row is one of the best games on the 360. I have spent almost as much time in this game as oblivion. the comparisons to GTA are inevitable when it comes to saints row, but i dont feel like they're ripping them off. they took the good ideas and moved them to the next level. to hold a lack of originality against this game would be completely insane. you might as well cast out every FPS for the last 10 years. now THOSE games are clones.Graphics - some pop up occurs when you're driving fast, but other than that Saints Row has a smooth framerate with nice textures and lighting effects. not the best looking game on the box, but it deffinitely doesnt look out of place.Gameplay - WAY better than any GTA ive played. ive grown so tired of that nearly broken auto-targeting of GTA. Saints Row decided to go in an fps direction. the game plays almost exactly like an fps with the aiming reticle in the center of the screen and all that but in a 3rd person view. all the cars handle well. everything in this game works very well.Story - meh... its decent, but the characters dont have that same draw as many gta characters and the stories surrounding them. there is a major plot twist toward the end, but you'll have to play through it to find out. basically there's 3 gangs, one ruling each part of the city, and its up to you and the Third Street Saints to clean up the town.Sound - GREAT soundtrack. classical, 80's hair metal, techno, rap, rock, and a little pop punk all thrown in the mix. its also really cool how your character has an MP3 player you can store songs on you buy in the in-game music store. its kind of pointless b/c if you want to listen to music the whole time you play you could just use whatever you have saved on the system.there's so much to do between missions other than killing hundreds of pedestrians. side missions include: saving ho's from mean pimps, driving one around while she does business in the back, racing, demolition derby, causing mass chaos, stealing certain cars and delivering them, kill certain people from a hit list, and others i cant remember right now.theres tons of stores to visit as well. Clothing stores have hats, shoes, belts, pants, shirts, coats, ect. you can get tattoos and the tattoo parlors. you can get piercings and bling at the jewelry shops. of course you can buy guns and such at the gun stores. theres liquer stores scattered through the city (you can get weed there too!). theres a few barber shops and plastic surgery centers. theres a couple car dealerships around too.another thing that needs to be mentioned is the character customization. you can choose from black, white, hispanic, or asian to start things off, and from there you adjust everything from their weight to the distance between their eyes and the style of hair.i was disappointed in the lack of aircraft. thats my only complaint about the entire game, and a very minor one.if you like the open world genre at all, and you havent played Saints Row yet, you need to right now.", "Saints Row is basically an imitation or parody of GTA. Okay we know this. But is it good? Not really. Thing is there seems to have been a rushed effort with this game. Sure there were good intentions, but there was alot left unfinished in this game. You can't pick up hookers. Why even have beat-the-pimp-up levels when you can't even pick them up? The character you customize can't talk. Customization is limited to generic males. The missions are either ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard. There is no middle ground. The cheat system is also redundant since you can't get acheivements with the cheats on, thus you can't make any progress in the game with them on. So why have the feature to begin with? The story line is about as generic-wannabe-GTA as you can get. You don't have the option of picking the gang you can join. This would have been nice. This game is for a rental not a buy. But if you do buy it, buy it used like I did. You'll feel very ripped off. Wait for the next GTA!", "If you are a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, there's a very good chance you will enjoy this title. Unlike the GTA titles, this game doesn't focus on the mafia, it instead focuses on a street gang that comes into existence to put a stop to street gang crime, and while doing so, begins to become what it tries to stop.It has a wonderful soundtrack, and fantastic graphics. IThe only downside? It's an Xbox 360 exclusive. This is fine, if you are a fan of Xbox, however I much prefer the PS3. Still, this is one of the best reasons to own an X360!", "\"I've played every GTA and this game and this game is 10x better - GTA gets old very fast, it feels like the missions are all the same and unrealistic at times...in this game it feels \"\"real\"\", the gang aspect and taking over turf is cool and having to protect it at anytime adds a cool focus to this game...definitely like the voice acting with keith david as the boss of the sains also\"", "\"Look, this game is not as good as GTA, especially the amazing experience that is San Andreas. However, this game is still very good and will hold over GTA fans until IV comes out later this year. If you enjoy playing GTA, chances are you will enjoy this game, especially where this franchise made some significant improvements. If you didn't like GTA games and are offended with overt violence, strong language, and direct sexual references, then steer away from this game. Here are the pros, cons, and \"\"washes\"\" as they compare to GTA:Pros:Better graphicsBetter sound effects of cars and weaponsCars are coolerSuperior implementation of the map functionality.Save system is improved, but I can not understand in today's day and age of gaming why RPG-action games like this don't have a \"\"save-at-any-time\"\" functionality or at least provide reasonable interim mission save points - which this game did not.Ability to save up to 70 cars in your garageInsurance Fraud missions are arguably the most enjoyable missions ever envisioned for a sandbox game.Some other missions that were direct rip-offs from GTA are arguably more fun like the pimp missions, hijacking, and hit-man.Cons:There is no mistaking that overall feeling of an awesome atmosphere you get in any GTA game that just wasn't present in this title. I can't put my finger on it, but you will see what I mean if you get to experience this game vs. any GTA game.Story was a little better in San AndreasNo planes, boats, motorcycles, helicopters, or bicycles.Voice acting is superior in GTA San Andreas. With that said, there was just way too much cursing. Cursing in any game or movie is good for adult entertainment when it is appropriate for the setting. This title just went way over the top on the cursing and was mostly out of place.Music selection is superior in San Andreas in both amount and quality.Washes - neither better or worse than GTA:Open world sandbox environment enabling diverse ways to execute missionsDriving mechanics of the carsDespite popular opinion, weapons functionality, though different, have about the same difficulty/ease factor.Map size and mission amount/scope is more epic in San Andreas, but this title is probably a little bigger that GTA III and possibly Vice City. Not too shabby.\"", "If you like GTA games, you'll probably like this.  It offers different things than GTA and doesn't quite integrate the collection activities like GTA does, but I found this to be great fun, including most of the side activities.  Many fewer things were as boring as some of the other open world activities in GTA, not that I'm degrading GTA at all since it is great on its own merits.  Personally I played Saints Row before GTA IV.  It might not live up to current standards since this was a release in the early xbox 360 life cycle.  But if you like the GTA experience, I don't think you can go wrong with this much to do in the game at a budget price.", "\"Alot of people are saying Gears of War was the best game of the year but I think Saints Row beats out everything. This game has just about everything that made the GTA games great. It has a large to city to explore and plenty of things to do. The missions are fun as well and the side activites are enjoyable. Hell any game that has an activity called \"\"Insurance Fraud\"\" has to be great right? Well this game is! Go pick it up.\"", "As with other reviews, it'd be easy to begin with gameplay comparisons to GTA, as there's no doubt THQ programmers 'borrowed' many elements from Rockstar's staple franchise... But so what? Many development houses learn from their peers and try to improve on its awesomeness - or just try to match it. If comparisons to GTA must be made, aside from stock GTA gameplay elements, it's probably most akin to GTA San Andreas. Specifically the gang turf block wars section where you fight gangs on the street or complete missions to convert blocks of the city to your colors.Saints Row is all about respect. You perform minor missions (called activities) such as escorting hookers or creating carnage on a big scale and this gives you respect - get enough respect and a main mission will open up. Complete a main mission and the block is yours - earning you cash every week. The storyline is usual fodder for these sorts of games - rival gangs are in your turf and you have to defeat them - by destroying their music HQ, stealing their drugs etc.In graphics are considerably improved over the GTA franchise. Stunning view distances, burning vehicles create haze, water looks incredible, and the architecture is almost on par with PGR3 in places. The cut scenes especially show the engine off - with depth of field blurring and nice sfx. Sonically things are equally good - no complaints.So I'm about 9% in (around 7 hours) and loving it. I like to drive around and check out the scenery - do what I want when I want and Saints Row let's me. (Sadly I keep driving around looking for unique jumps!). So yes - it's a GTA type game. It's great fun and looks 1,000 times better than its inspiration.Had rockstar released a GTA game for the 360 I would probably not rate this game as high - but for now it's well worth your money and should tide you over until GTA4 comes out.
