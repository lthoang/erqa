I needed simple drag and drop, with a FM radio and a battery that didn't require me hook up the usb.  I also wanted at least 1GB and didn't want to spend $100.  Enter the Creative Zen Nano Plus!I've used Creative products over the years and never had problems with their quality... this TINY mp3 player is no different. It's small and plastic, but transfers files quickly and effortlessly. I read the short book that came with it and within ten minutes of opening the package I was listening to music files I'd transfered from my computer.I will be getting new earphones for it (the phones are a bit too large for my ears), but the sound quality improved once I discovered the EQ settings and there's volume left to spare!", "This little MP3 player is based on flash memory instead of a hard drive. Compared to hard drives which eventually die, an MP3 player based on flash memory is a longer-lasting investment. The Nano Plus is loaded with features such as one gigabyte of storage for music or other files, an FM radio, a built in mic and various recording functions. Like most consumer grade MP3 players such as the iPod, the Nano Plus cannot play albums without gaps in between the tracks. Audiophiles who carefully encode their albums using gapless-capable formats may want to avoid this player and seek out high-end players such as Rio Karma. Firmware upgrades could eventually give gapless playback capability to the Nano Plus. Sadly, with all its amazing features the Nano Plus is cheaply built from flimsy plastic. From a design perspective the Nano Plus looks like it could have been engineered by Homer Simpson. It has an odd navigation system that ultimately does get the job done. The overall sound quality is decent--as good or better than any iPod but a far cry from the likes of Cowon iAudio. Dragging music onto the device is simple and requires no special software besides basic storage drivers. It shows up like a regular drive. With only the drivers installed from the Creative web site you can avoid using the included CD. It comes with a soft rubber case which is very useful for protecting this delicate toy from destruction. Be extremely careful if you plan to use the Zen Nano Plus while excerising. A single AAA battery keeps it playing for up to 18 hours. Considering the battery is easily replaceable you could potentially own this device for many many years without it needing service or replacement.", "After having no success with a Sandisk Sansa C240 (see my review of that) we decided to go for Creative.  We should have just done it to begin with as I've owned nothing but Creative and iRiver in the MP3 market (Nomad Jukebox, Creative Zen Vision) and they all are fantastic.  No problems at all.  EVER.The first thing you notice about this is it feels solid.  This little player while light, has a good weight.  It sounds great and comes with an armband.  That's right, comes with an armband.  That will save you $25 right there.If you workout, look no further.  This is the MP3 player for you.Very tiny buttons and a somewhat confusing interface to work through keep it at just under a 5 star rating.", "Unlike most, I didn't purchase this MP3 player to listen to music (though now that I have it, I will probably put some of my favorite tunes on it!). Our public library offers downloadable audio books and I needed a portable device that would play locked WMA files. Through browsing the web I thought I would pay $200 - $300 for such a player until someone at the library recommended this one. WOW! Hard to believe such a tiny device can put out such crystal clear CD-quality sound! I'm hooked! The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't bookmark my place in the audio book (Solution is to pause your book, turn the player OFF. If you return to it within 24 hours it will pick up where you left off). Otherwise, I can't say enough about this tiny powerhouse of any MP3 / WMA player!", "Don't believe the negative reviews.  I've had two of them in the house for almost 6 months. No problems. They are great for downloading books on tape and music. Some libraries offer free downloads that will work on this Creative Zen Nano.  They are small and easy to carry around---weigh almost nothing! Email:boland7214@aol.", "\"I would have given Creative Zen Nano Plus (abbreviated \"\"CZNP\"\") 5 stars, except for two small deficiences: it does not have gapless playback (see #4 below), and the build quality and controls are kind of cheap (see #9 below).  Assuming it lasts, it seems a very good unit for the money.  Here's why I bought mine.0. Do I want to make a fashion statement with my choice of MP3 player?Some people will only buy a trendy iPod.  Buying a lesser-known unit like CZNP makes a different fashion statement, especially since you can choose from 12 colors.  I prefer function over form, but CZNP offers some of each.1. Do I want more than just sound?The CZNP is a basic MP3 player, FM Radio, and recorder.  It has a simple monochrome display and controls that make it a good choice for playing music, podcasts, and ebooks, and listening to local radio stations.  It can record from the built-in mike or radio, or from a line input, which may be handy at times.Some players can play videos, show pictures, etc, and cost a lot more because of the required color screen and larger memory.  I don't need these things and prefer not to spend the money needed to get them.2. Will I be listening to mostly music or mostly spoken content?When you switch off a unit while it is playing, or pause it and it turns off automatically after awhile, some units will resume at the beginning of the current track, and others (e.g. CZNP) resume exactly where you left off.  If you are playing music, you usually prefer to start the song over again.  For ebooks or long podcasts, I need to resume where it was turned off (like CZNP does), because it is hard to fast-advance back to where you were.3. What kind of accessories can I get?Creative has a set of speakers tailored to the CZNP, and there are many generic accessories that will work with it.  By comparison, there are entire catalogs of accessories tailored for optimal use with an iPod (and may not work with others).  I have what I need, but pine for some things available for iPod only.4. How convenient is it to use?MP3 players vary considerably on how easy they are to use.  The iPod is famous for ease of use, though it does not do everything I want to do.  The CZNP has relatively cheap controls that work well enough, and does what I want.  You don't have to be a computer whiz to use it or its software.5. How long will it last?On Amazon, click the link \"\"See all 109 customer reviews\"\", then look for the dropdown \"\"Show:\"\" and choose \"\"Lowest review first\"\" and click the Go button.  There are a number of reports from people who had problems with their CZNP, some bad enough to throw it away.  Some are real problems, others might be a lack of understanding how to use the player.Despite these complaints, the average review is high.  You'll find about the same mix of reviews for most players.I decided to take a chance.  My unit will be well-cared for.  If I have a problem, I'll update this review.6. Can the battery be replaced?CZNP uses an AAA battery which is said to last for 15 hours and can be changed easily.The iPod Nano has a rechargeable battery that is not designed to be replaced, which means the iPod Nano becomes landfill when the battery no longer takes a charge in a couple of years. There will be millions of iPods being thrown away simply because the owner cannot make them continue to work, which has an impact on the environment.  There are now battery replacement kits for iPod, with tools and instructions, so this concern is lessened for DIY people, but most won't bother.7. How does it sound?The CZNP sounds very good to when when I use good earphones like Koss \"\"The Plug\"\", or when plugged into a stereo.The free headphones you get with it won't give you the best sound, and you should not judge the player on how it sounds with them.  Go buy quality earphones for any new player, as this will make a huge improvement in your enjoyment at relatively low cost.8. Does the player use flash memory or hard-disk for storage?CZNP uses flash-memory.  Flash memory is more expensive per MB/GB than hard disk memory, and flash memory players are smaller than hard disk players.  I would not want a hard disk, which I think is too heavy and too fragile for a portable player.  Get a hard disk player if you want to carry a lot of content, but make sure you have a backup.  Get a flash memory player if you want to hold the content you will listen to today or this week.9. Does the player have enough memory?I think I can have 12-16 hours of MP3 music at highest quality on the CZNP 1GB player, or podcasts (lower quality) up to 32 hours.  With that much space I can have some new or favorite albums left on the player, and have plenty of room for content that changes (like podcasts).  If you don't use a computer regularly, you might want more memory, maybe even a hard disk.10. Does the player support gapless playback between tracks?Some albums have music that flows continously from one track to the next.  Examples: Radiohead \"\"OK Computer\"\", Dandy Warhols, Moody Blues.  The listening experience is disrupted if the tracks have a gap as the player switches from one track to another.I don't know of any portable MP3 player that offers gapless playback (without Rockbox), though it's bound to come.  The CZNP has a brief gap with no clicks, but it is still somewhat disruptive.  One solution is to rip the album as one continuous track.  The Rockbox open-source technology essentially replaces the firmware on your player, and it features gapless playback.  It is supported on a few players, including some iPods, but not CZNP.11. Does the player require proprietary software or hardware?CZNP includes software, but it can work like a USB drive, so you can manage content with Explorer / Finder if you want to.  All connectors are industry standard (though the 3/32\"\" stero line input is less common).As I understand it, iPod can only load music using iTunes, and other players require software supplied with the unit, or with Windows.  The iPod and others also use proprietary connectors, replacing a lost cable is more expensive.  I would not be happy with such restrictions. Open standards promote flexibility and interoperability.For me, at a minimum, the player needs to look like a USB drive when I connect it to the computer, so that I can load it by dragging files to the player's file system, and the CZNP does that.  I want to have a program automatically create a custom listening program of various short podcasts that play in a particular order to support Radio on Demand, and I want that to happen by simply connecting the device to the computer, with no keyboard or mouse interaction involved.  I have not found such a program, and may have to write it, but I can do that if I want to.  With an iPod I have no choice but to use iTunes (or replace the firmware with Rockbox).12. Is the player file-based or tag-based?The CZNP is file-based: it can play songs in alphabetical order for a given folder.  (It also has shuttle, etc.)  I tried the SanDisk Sansa, but returned it because all content is organized and played on the basis of tags, exclusively.  While my music has tags correctly set to play the way I wanted, podcasts don't use tags consistently enough to play them in a particular order that I chose.  With the CZNP you can at least control the order by putting a sequence number at the beginning of each filename.Tag-based probably have some advantages over file-based, but only if all of the content you want to play is properly tagged.\"", "My review can be summed up in one sentence: You can get a BUNCH of songs on this VERY SMALL player and play them for a VERY LONG TIME!I love the new Sandisk Sansa's, the m230, m240, and m250, and I only gave them 4 stars.  Without a doubt, the Creative Zen Nano get's 5 stars.  It's that good.  It doesn't have all the cool cache' of the iPod nano, but it is without question the most optimized little player I have had the pleasure to review.Creative has been in the MP3 player business for a LONG time.  Their early offerings came up against a market that wasn't fully matured and able to handle the higher end devices they produced.  Apple stole their thunder and has overshadowed everybody with the iPod.  Creative's higher capacity devices are still too large to compete on portability.  It's funny the way things work out.  If not for Creative, Apple wouldn't have ever had a market to introduce the iPod into.The Creative Zen Nano is lighter than the competition, and is actually much smaller than the iPod Shuffle.  Unlike the shuffle, however, you can actually see your track names!  The little LCD isn't high resolution, but it's perfect for a player this size.The controls are simple but effective.  A 2 way toggle wheel let's you forward or reverse from song to song.  There's a play / pause button on the front panel and forward & reverse buttons on the side by the toggle wheel.  Other than a headphone jack and a line in jack, the unit has a USB B port and the battery panel.  That's it.  I think these controls are the best possible for the form factor.  The only potential negative is that they might be on the small size for somebody with larger fingers.What about sound?  The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo.  As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds.  I've yet to use a pair of standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.  I will say that the armstrap could have been better designed.  Also, this unit definitely does not have the power output of the iPod Nano, and as such may not be loud enough for those who really love to blast it.  But as a result, the power consumption is the best I've seen.  I've gone over a week on a single AAA battery!For those needing more space, the Zen Nano doesn't have larger storage options. This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Even with a HUGE music collection, I can get a great deal of music on here and take it with me everywhere.The price isn't a give-away, and this unit won't make it through battle, but it strikes a good enough balance to meet your needs for a long long time to come.  Highly recommended.Pros -- great stereo sound- nice capacity- ridiculous battery life!!!- light-weight- FM tuner ( though it's just average )- voice recording- Direct line-in recording!!!! ( for those without a PC )- ergonomic design- great navigation and sorting features- Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible- USB 2.0 connectivity- replaceable battery!!!Cons- smallish buttons- Average shuffle feature- mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )- some song transfer issues on older computers- not enough size options- no slot expansion(...)", "Sure I know there are fancier mp3 players out there, but I think this one is ideal for the price. I have had no problems loading the songs or using the device at all. I have only had it for a few months, but can find no fault with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the memory could only store about 200 songs as opposed to the 500 songs advertised. The ear buds also did not fit my ears too well, but this probably would be a problem with any ear buds as they all seem to be the same size. This was easily solved with a different kind of head phone set that I purchased for under $20. In conclusion, this is a good mp3 player to buy as long as you don't have a need to download too many cd's. I am happy with it.", "With all the hype around MP3 players, it always seems to be a choice between the Ipod, and everything else. Not everything else seems to actually deliver. That is definitely what I found ou with Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus MP3 players. Although the player is very lightweight and convient in price, I just ish I could say that for the player on its own. This MP3 player doesn't really work with my Windows XP laptop computer, although it did wih my previous Windows ME edition operating system. I was very dissapointed. Although the player handles well wthin the software it delivers, where you can burn music, and convert your files into MP3, windows media, or traditional wav formats, the zan nano plus, sadly misses out on files you download from sites like rhapsody, and musicmatch.All in all, I absolutly recommend this purchase, only for the software, not te MP3 player on its own, because it malfunctioned on my computer. Instead, try another MP3 player like the Ipod, or something that really can work on music downloads.Price: CConvience: DEasy To Operate: DSoftware: B-Overall: D+", "I use my MP3 player mostly for listening to audiobooks. I was looking for a player that would allow me to stop at any point and resume quickly. This unit fits the bill perfectly. While there are no bookmarks, you don't need them. It's better. All you do is shut it off. When you turn it back on it starts where you left off. Perfect for my needs.The software allows you to quickly put each track in order by putting a tag in front of each track. Very quickly and easily. You don't do it manually.In addition, you can easily make voice recordings. I find the sound great. Of course, the sound in any MP3 player is only as good as the headset or earphones. The phones that come with the unit have a good crisp sound but I don't like plugs in my ears as I have keen hearing and they hurt my ears. So I use a headset that fits over my ears. You have to search for phones that sound good to you. Of course, the ones that come with the player may satisfy you just fine. They are decent.I did call support three times and got right through. Their support is pretty good. The manual and help that comes with the unit and in the software is not good or complete. And the software takes a bit of learning. I had to use several different software applications to get going. But once you get used to the software it's pretty easy to use.This is an inexpensive player and wonderful for you audio book listeners. To me 1gig is a lot of space. For some of you it isn't much at all. So consider your needs before you buy. I get all I need from this player and hopefully will have it a long time. Before this I used a RIO 500, which shows you how long I tend to use a player.Oh, it does have an FM radio. I don't use that but it is a nice feature. I wanted something basic and this fits the bill.I highly recommend the Zen Nano Plus.", "It's a handy little MP3 player if you can't afford an iPod (or if you're trying to make an anti-Apple statement). It gets the job done and it sounds pretty good. Back when it was released, it was intended to compete with the iPod Shuffle. The Creative Nano had an LCD screen and an FM radio when the pricier alternative didn't. The Shuffle still doesn't have a DRO or FM radio.It has one feature that makes it both superior and inferior at the same time. It uses 1 AAA battery which means you can replace the battery when it runs out of juice without sending it to the manufacturer. But it's not as convenient as plugging in at night to recharge. And the battery cover is pretty flimsy. The tab that locks it into place snapped off within a week. It is now secured with a very attractive beige rubber band requisitioned from work.4 stars for an MP3 player that doesn't try to impress you with ground-breaking industrial-design and simply works."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10292866826057434, 0.1598874181509018, 0.00010129583824891597, 0.2003736048936844, 0.04875602200627327, 0.4199291169643402, 0.0018688670825213194, 0.01364761870354414, 0.028222428634762764, 0.005065198056399822, 0.019219769164919853]]}
