But SEGA decided to make a more mature game fit more for teens as they created a game that revolved around Shadow the hedgehog, the dark form of Sonic.Story-This is almost a spin-off of Sonic Heroes, as at the beginning Shadow is still trying to remember his past.  As he is thinking, though, some aliens called the Black Arms start dropping down and attacking the city.  The leader comes to Shadow talking as if he knows him, and reminding him that he promised to help them. Shadow doesn't remember this at all, but he sets forth to try to recover his memory.Gameplay-The game consists of missions that have multiple goals that are either Dark goals, Hero goals, or Neutral Goals.  For instance you start out with mission 1 and you can A.help the Black Arms kill humans B.help the humans kill the Black Arms or C.Get the chaos emeralds hidden in the city and escape.  Depending on which missions you complete, you are taken to another location to continue your story, where you choose your next mission to complete.  So, in fact, you are building your own story by choosing how you want it to play out.  The controls are rather simple, and it is easy to use.  Some people complained that when shooting at an enemy, it aims for you.  I rather liked this, for it made it easier on me!  There are a variety of weapons you can use from basic guns to sign posts to a vacuum type weapon.  Also, there are a variety of familiar faces in this game.  See, for each mission you have someone to guide you through the Dark and Hero goals.  The leader of the Black Arms usually guides you through the Dark missions while Sonic, Amy, Rouge, and more guide you through the Hero Missions.  There are checkpoints throughout the game to save on, and if/when you die, you go back to one of them.  You also collect rings in the game, as usual.  They aren't really good for anything besides getting a high score, but if hit, you lose ten of the rings you had.  If hit when you have no rings, you die.Graphics-The graphics are pretty good in this game.  They are usually very dark, but they are detailed, although you are usually whipping through the levels at a very fast speed.  The characters are designed well, but there isn't much blood, so don't expect the game to be gory, just detailed.Sound-The music is nice, but not as good as some sonic games.  It's usually very soft in the background that it's not very noticeable.  They actually all sound the same except for Circus Park which was actually a good one.  Don't get me wrong, the music isn't bad, it's just nothing to get excited about.  The voice acting is just like it is in any other Sonic game, so take that however you like.  There is a \"\"bad word\"\" or two in the game when you die, but it's not a huge deal.  The background sounds such as picking up rings and shooting are nice, as well.Fun-This is a really fun game.  It let's you kind of create the story which is nice, and the gameplay was fun, in my opinion.Length-If you want to play through everything it will take you a while.  There are 22 levels, 10 endings, and several Boss Battles.  Yes, there are 10 different endings.  Only 3 of them contain different \"\"bad guys\"\" but depending which ending you choose depends on how the story ends and who Shadow turns out to be.  After playing all missions and levels, I still enjoy going back and playing this game.This is a great third-person shooter for those who enjoy choosing their own story.  It isn't perfect because the music is kind of boring and other things, but it is a great game that takes the Sonic game, adds Shadow, and makes it a more mature game for teens.\"", "It's all too easy to draw parallels between Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The classic mascot characters have endured the years to become videogame icons, recognized and loved by millions of game addicts around the globe. Nintendo's fat, Italian plumber helped pioneer the platformer genre and SEGA's blue hedgehog transformed it completely, placing a new emphasis on speed and rollercoaster-inspired level designs. In the old days, Mario and Sonic stood on even ground, each taking lead roles in an impressive selection of critically acclaimed titles. But as the years passed and consoles become more and more powerful, Mario's inevitable jump to the third dimension faired much better than Sonic's. Case in point: Super Mario 64 is remembered even today as one of the greatest games of all time. Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast is conversely thought of as a flawed, but still enjoyable sequel by hardcore fans, and an altogether broken platformer by everybody else.It is more than a little puzzling, therefore, that developers SEGA Studios USA and Sonic Team continue to draw upon that archaic, clunky design for various Hedgehog-based sequels. Sonic Adventure 2, for instance, hit Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube with the same fundamental mechanics and shortcomings that blemished the original title. And now, the software house has created Shadow the Hedgehog for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, a game that looks and plays like it was designed for Dreamcast a full six years ago. Sonic's darker half occasionally shines in the same way that its predecessors did -- namely, with an impressive sense of speed and dazzling stages complete with trademark twists and turns. And it's solely for these reasons that anybody who defends the original Sonic Adventure will probably like Shadow's one. Alternatively, though, players unimpressed with Sonic's Dreamcast outings will find more of the same here, and unlike a fine wine, age has not improved the formula.Identity CrisisShadow the Hedgehog seems to be Sonic Team's unofficial attempt at aging up its platformer games and as a result the title regularly deals with slightly darker and more convoluted themes that center on the balance between good and evil. The story is kick-started by a gorgeously rendered full-motion animation cinematic that introduces players to the troubled Hedgehog, who has recently lost his memory and is struggling to come to grips with his place in the world. The tale picks up after the events in Sonic Heroes and consequently Shadow can only vaguely recall in flashbacks that there was a girl named Maria, he may have loved her, and she was murdered.Shadow isn't allowed much alone time before his thought process is so rudely interrupted by the sounds of war and destruction. An alien threat called Black Arms explodes onto the scene and demolishes everything in its path, including nearby city skyscrapers. This is, again, all illustrated in impressive FMA cut-scenes that seasoned Sonic fans will undoubtedly appreciate. Shadow observes this phenomenon with a level of indifference before he is approached by a demon-like figure known as Black Doom, who leads the extraterrestrial forces. The menacing entity acts as though he knows Shadow and commands the Hedgehog to retrieve the seven powerful Chaos Emeralds located throughout the land. The anti-hero begrudgingly agrees, but only because Black Doom promises to restore his memory immediately after the artifacts are collected.This oddball setup is supposed to extend into and become an integral part of the gameplay experience. Shadow is out for himself and therefore he can and in fact does switch allegiances depending on the preferences of players. The hedgehog can be made to carry out Black Doom's commands, or he can switch sides and team up with Sonic and friends, or even Dr. Eggman. Changing teams is as simple as tapping the D-Pad during gameplay. One quick tap and Shadow will find himself being guided to various goals, such as destroying G.U.N. troops, for Black Doom. Another tap and Sonic and friends will appear at his side to fight against the Black Arms.The concept itself is intriguing primarily because it enables gamers to choose different paths for themselves as the hero advances through the adventure. The choices made will have a direct bearing on the stages that follow thanks to a branching storyline that allows for several possible paths and endings. This is a clever way to extend replay value and we're confident that completionists will play through the title several times, switching allegiances, so that they may see everything that there is to see.However, observing the unique goals per different allegiances is a messy undertaking marred by poor design. The fact of the matter is that any level of serious planned strategizing is wholly unobtainable in the intensely frantic makeup of the game, whose mechanics perpetually dart Shadow forward with both limited visibility and control. In turn, even when gamers are trying to fight alongside Sonic and friends, they will accidentally dispose of hordes of allies and even zoom into and activate switches or complete puzzle components that they should ignore. This truth renders the entire operation of choosing sides more or less useless.Speed, Loops and Guns, But Very Little FunDreamcast owners will already have an unfortunately accurate idea of how Shadow the Hedgehog plays (and for that matter, looks). To be brief, like Sonic Adventure before it. What this means is that speed and forward momentum are emphasized over control, puzzles, or to be frank, depth. Honestly, that isn't always a bad thing. Shadow, like Sonic before him, has his redeeming gameplay moments. We're referring to the rollercoaster-like stages complete with loop-de-loops, corkscrews and pinball bouncers that send the hedgehog zigzagging up and down environments at remarkable speeds. Because these scenarios are still plentiful, undeterred supporters of Sonic Team's efforts will undoubtedly find something to like about Shadow's quest.That noted, these thrill-ride fundamentals have outworn their welcome, as far as we're concerned. Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome. Admittedly, Shadow is at its best when the character is zipping through 360s and or skating a rollercoaster track. But it's also during these moments that the game plays itself. It is, in fact, possible, for participants to put their controllers down for seconds at a time and simply watch what unfolds. How is relinquishing control for what amounts to watching Shadow tumble through a scripted corkscrew a rewarding play environment?Unfortunately for Sonic's darker half, there are all-new problems exclusive to his adventure. The very first level in Shadow the Hedgehog is a shining example of spectacularly lackluster game design and probably one of the worst single stages that we've played in any title for many months. The reluctant hero is thrust into a drab environment and immediately nudged forward -- right into a progression of objects, including obstructing walls and enemies. Disappointingly, the platformer also features a horrendously malfunctioned camera system that catches on environments or even occasionally runs amok for no particular discernible reason. The result? Commonly frustrating undertakings where the goal is to burst forward and gain speed, but before that can happen Shadow crashes into enemies and loses rings, or simply goes careening off a ledge. These impossibly trying outcomes are worsened because Shadow moves loosely through the worlds he explores, which at times makes precision navigation an insurmountable hurdle.The character can, unlike Sonic, wield a number of imposing weapons, from massive swords to explosive projectiles. But in a move that again harkens back to the days of Dreamcast, there is no lock-on system in place and therefore what is a simple process in other titles is overly complex and cumbersome here. Successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance. Sonic Team has positioned Shadow's gunplay as a primary selling point to the platformer, but in practice the mechanics are really not that enjoyable.Recycled technology and replicated production values have ensured that Shadow the Hedgehog looks and sounds almost exactly like its Sonic-based predecessors. To Sonic Team's credit, there are more than 20 levels in the game and each is varied in design. Some areas have a futuristic look to them while others feature large metropolis backgrounds and more still take Shadow through lava and forest settings. Meanwhile, the game engine draws long, stretching locales populated with a moderate number of polygonal characters. And on GameCube and Xbox, the fluidity usually aspires for the 60 frames per second mark with some dips. The PlayStation 2 version is noticeably more sluggish despite the fact that it is visually lacking compared to its counterparts. And yet, these are small graphic victories, especially when held to today's more robust standards. Shadow oftentimes looks like it could have been designed for Dreamcast simply because the worlds and characters lack polygon numbers, which leads to a generally square presentation void of curvy shapes. Worse is that many of the game's textures are downright muddy, especially when the camera malfunctions and pans up close, as it consistently does. And overall character animation is primitive and incomplete when compared to the majority of today's games.Shadow the Hedgehog is proof that Sonic Team needs to get with the program if it plans to compete with legitimate current and next- generation software. This is Sonic Adventure with guns and less polish, and players today are far more discerning than they were six years ago. Diehard Sonic fans will cling to the fact that the title still conjures up corkscrews and loop-de-loops, as well as an impressive sense of speed when Shadow really gets moving, and this is all true. But this doesn't make up for the game's long list of shortcomings, from stupid level design, unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphics.", "This is the best sonic game ever to be realsed  it has the coolest weapons ever pistols kifes lazers you name it.Parents are geting so angrey about the game just becuse they thought it was rated E didn't they see the 10+ on the box and secound of all they should look at the back of the box to see what the game is rated befor they even buy it.Anyway at the begianing shadow is still trying to figure out who he is but can't then all the sudden the sky truns red and alians start dystroying the town then shadow gets a message from the leader black doom that if he brings him the 7 choas emralds he will tell him his past shadow dosn't know what to think but he bealives him and sets out the find them.You can choose to do dark missions or hero missions and just normal missions.Thare is also a 2 player battle mode whare you can play has shadow or metal shadow and collect weapons to fight agenist your friends.The thing that sega went to far with is the swearing ever time shadow falls or get hit he says d**n it youll probley here it about 40 times befor you beat the entire game they also say h**l sometimes.This is a great game but in my opinon I think it should be rated T for teens just for some of its content if you are a hudge sonic or shadow fan go buy this game now!", "This is what got me back into the Sonic franchise after the Genesis days. Shadow is, in a nutshell, the darker, more mature, bad-@$$ version of Sonic. Weapon-toting and awesome, a bit of gameplay will get you used to Shadow's unique abilities. It's not quite as clumsy with the controls as Sonic Heroes is either. There's also a choice system with ten very distinct endings which unlock one big, final ending. Getting here can take awhile, and gives it a lot of replay value to unlock many other paths than just the 10 distinct endings.This makes the ending vastly better than, shall we say, a certain Bioware game that was recently released.Some would say that guns, vehicles, cursing etc. don't belong in a Sonic game. My reply? THIS IS SHADOW'S GAME, NOT SONIC'S.Even despite that fact, why not make it a bit more mature? Or have the Genesis fans not matured over the years? I like games with dark, bad-@$$ tones personally.I would highly recommend this game to fans of Sonic, Shadow, shooters and people who like unorthodox action games. I still love it.", "I've only begun playing it, and already it's great (even though there were parts in it that were a pain--but then again, even the greatest games have problem spots!).  It's also great that the player can decide if the hero is good or evil (or neutral).  There should be more games where the player can decide if their character is good or bad!", "This game should've been rated T because it's pretty violent. I just thought it's something I should mention before I review the game. Anyway, critics have insulted this game time after time, when it's actually a pretty good game. It's fun because you can play a different set of levels every time you play through the game. There are always at least two ways to play through each level, so you're not forced to do any one thing.Presentation- 65/100Graphics- 66.5/100Sound- 56/100Gameplay- 86/100Replay Value- 90/100Overall- 81.5/100", "\"My little brother has been wanting this game for some time now. I checked the ratings and was not sure we would like this game. Unlike many other Sonic games, this game was full of gunplay violence and offensive language. It's more like Grand Theft Auto.However, I'm glad we did play this game. Despite the violence and the offensive language, it's neat to meet Black Doom, the leader of the jet black and crimson aliens. Shadow is brought back to life, but can't remember his past, so Black Doom tells him, \"\"Shadow, find the seven chaos emeralds, and bring them to me as promised.\"\" Shadow is not sure whom he trusts, so it's up to you to decide. Shadow's quest between good and evil depends on what kinds of missions he does. If Shadow takes orders from Dr. Eggman and Black Doom, he will become a villian. However, if Shadow takes orders from the GUN army and Sonic and his friends, he will become a hero.Other reviewers have commented on the violence and the offensive language of the game in a negative light, but I think most children find out about this before the age of 7.Overall, 4 stars. Sonic Heroes holds our attention more than this game does, but still, I think this game is definitely worth renting.\"", "Sonic the Hedgehog on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 has gotten arguably the worst rep. of any Sonic game out there, but there's one game I can easily recall that deserves as much negativity. That game is THIS monstrosity. I was at least able to find Sonic 06 to be a guilty pleasure of some sort, but THIS game is just BAD! There's a lot of questions raised that shouldn't even be here in the first place! Why does Shadow have to have weapons? Why do the characters curse all of a sudden? To make the game &#34;edgy&#34;? Give me a break! Arguably the worst offender in this is: Why do there have to be branching paths?Truth be told, I bought Shadow the Hedgehog (via FeaturePoints for Amazon gift cards....Didn't exactly use real money) just to play through its &#34;neutral&#34; pathway in the game, which only requires me to get to the end of each level, and nothing more. There was a bit of fun to be had (In fact, the gunplay isn't too shabby), but that fun was bombarded with tons of unnecessary things!The level design is bad. In the first level, Westopolis, don't be surprised if you run straight into several inexplicable explosions while just trying to get a move on. Other levels don't exactly have as much frustrations, but there are still general problems like not being able to get a good view of where to jump at certain points, and control that feels slipperier than in Sonic Heroes. Instances such as the Shadow clones to fight in one of the later levels, though, get very tedious. Playing through the game would really suck if you do not grab a gun to shoot with, because Shadow's Homing Attacks don't deal damage nearly as quick, and you can FORGET about his punch/kick attacks!If you thought the voice actors in Sonic Heroes were too cringing for you, then you're going to be absolutely ANNOYED with the new 4Kids/Sonic X voice cast's work done here! At nearly every turn in a level, a character Shadow meets earlier in the level feels the need to say something! And if you're not doing what he/she says you should do, the character will just complain or scold at you for not doing so. Leave me alone, NPCs! Either way, the voices here are AWFUL (With the lone exceptions being Sonic and Dr. Eggman)! Yes, I even disliked Shadow's new voice actor. He didn't even sound much like Shadow in the game!You'd think at least the music would be good right? Welll.......not really. Shadow the Hedgehog's soundtrack is mostly crappy, with few exceptions.If all of that wasn't bad enough, you apparently are not supposed to be happy with the ending you get after playing through the handful of levels you've chosen to play through. YEP! In one playthrough, you just have to play six levels, but for the sake of replayability, doing a Hero or Evil mission will lead you to different levels entirely, but each and every mission in this game (With exceptions being to just make it to the end of a level) is a boring, dull, painful chore. Most of them consist of nabbing excessive amounts of objects. I'll leave it at that.Oh, did I say &#34;for the sake of replayability&#34;? Oh I'm sorry. What I meant to say was &#34;for the sake of UNLOCKING THE FINAL STORY SEGMENT&#34;. Yeah....Like Sonic Adventures and Heroes, there's a Final Story segment. They really shouldn't have done that for this kind of game! It completely throws the whole premise out the window!Ugh.....I believe I've gone long enough here. Just stay away from this title if you're looking for an even decent Sonic title. Whether it be the Adventure titles, Heroes, or even recent ones like Sonic Colors, Generations, or Unleashed, they're ALL better than this game. Steer clear.", "\"Now this is what true sonic games are all about \"\" Well is not a sonic game though but improves very well over sonic heroes the game has a good story to it ' all though what they added in it is 326 story path ' so if you do beat the game you wont get bored with it you can just go back and complete all story paths . now this game is like a sonic adventure 3 , the enivorement is so coolGameplay 10/10it has the same controllers from sonic heroes , though but i can see why though but its no biggie . its a good way to move fast in the stage , and the space stages looks so much like they took the space stages from SA2B and remixed them in Shadow The Hedgehog , also the gun fits shadows personailty very well , its actually pretty fast fun paste to use itSound 10/10I maybe the only person who dont mind the sonic x VA in it , but they did do a good job in it actuallyMusic 10/10The music is a blast , some tunes make you wish you owned the soundtrack that is out now also lost impact has pretty music2 Player Mode 9/102 player mode is my only disapointment i was expecting more stages in it not just 3Overall 10/10its a real fun game that will keep ya going at it , if you like shadow the hedgehog , so buy this game you'll like it ^-^\"", "THIS GAME RULES!

Before this game was released, many people didn't know much about Shadow the Hedgehog and his mysterious past. This game would show people just what they were missing out on.The story starts out when we're introduced to Shadow thinking about his past. It is while wondering who he is and where he comes from, he notices aliens falling from the sky and destroying a city before his eyes. At the same time, he meets the leader of the aliens: Black Doom. Black Doom tells Shadow that he can reveal his past to him if Shadow gives Black Doom the seven chaos emeralds. From then on, the way the story goes is up to you.Oh, and did I mention the swearing? That's right; Shadow the Hedgehog contains a mild amount of swearing in its storyline and even when you die or get hurt. Such a fact remains controversial for parents of children who own this game.There are three ways to finish a level: you can be the hero, the villain, or a neutral hedgehog in the midst of chaos. When you are in hero mode, you will team up with Sonic or another Sonic character and do good deeds--such as killing aliens. When you are in the evil mode, either Black Doom or Dr. Eggman will instruct you do either do their will or kill humans. In neutral mode, your job is to either make it to the end of the level or grab a chaos emerald.In terms of gameplay, it plays almost exactly like any ordinary Sonic game--but with a few tweaks here and there. First of all, Shadow can use weapons scattered in his surroundings: a very controversial fact among Sonic fans. He can also use the homing attack, yet there are a lot of places where--instead of doing a homing attack--you'll send yourself flying to your death. Finally you have the spin dash, which isn't very useful in this game except for when you're trying to squeeze through tight spaces.After beating every single level in the game, you are introduced to the \"\"Final Story\"\", but I will not reveal any information about its story. Let's just say its the climax of the entire game.Overall, Shadow the Hedgehog I would have to say is an okay game. It uses the same engine from Sonic Heroes and puts it in a game revolving around Shadow. I'll have to admit that it's very fun before you defeat the final boss. After that, however, it becomes very boring and repetitive.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.027581343427300453, 0.011664108373224735, 0.18470042943954468, 0.10945664346218109, 0.15865455567836761, 0.08733930438756943, 0.01110463310033083, 0.011298419907689095, 0.07096610218286514, 0.2284940481185913, 0.09874038398265839]]}
