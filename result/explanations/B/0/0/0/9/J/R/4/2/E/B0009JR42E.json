(See customer images). Installation was a breeze. The instructions were easy to follow and the mount is very sturdy. It comes with a ton of different adapters and an easy-to-use compatibility guide so you can quickly match up your TV with the right adapter.Highly recommended for someone looking for a low-profile mount.UPDATE 10/03/07: I recently upgraded to aPanasonic TH-58PZ700U 58\"\" 1080p Plasma HDTV. This mount worked like a champ using the thicker set of \"\"bars\"\" to attach to the panel.\"", "I put this unit up for my brother.  Although I needed a quick call to Pearless, it was painless and they had the answers right away.  It's a massive bracket, well made and ready for business.", "Been holding my 42&#34; Panasonic plasma on the wall securely for the past 6 years. Just make sure you locate the studs for mounting!", "I have to admit that I was a bit intimidated hoisting up my brand new plasma TV onto a mount but it was basically a no hassle event.After attaching the base to the wall, and following the excellent instructions on which bracket to use for the TV, I held it up while my wife connected the cable and power cord and we placed it on the mount.Quick and easy.  If you're not sure which mount to buy, the Peerless website lets you enter your make/model and tells you which mounts are for your TV (flat or angled) which is a nice tool.", "Cheap mounts do not let you mount outlets behind it, this is completely open!  I love this mount.  Well worth the few extra bucks.", "Does exactly what it says.  Simple to mount, great instructions, comes with all kinds of hardware for seemingly any kind of TV.  A simple, well built, no nonsense mount.  Exactly what I was looking for.", "I used this with the 50 inch Panasonic TH-50PX60U flat panel TV.  It was straightforward, but I think 20 minutes to install (like some of the reviews stated) is unrealistic, unless you do this kind of thing regularly.The instructions don't specify which of the two different bars to attach to the back of the TV.  You can use either:  one offers a little more clearance than the other.  I opted for the slim design.  This makes the tightening of the safety screws a chore, since it's not possible to turn the screw with the (included) long Allen wrench a complete revolution without it hitting the wall.  This means that each half turn requires pulling the wrench out and putting it back in.  I'm thinking about cutting off the end of the wrench and attaching to a drill for future adjustments.One issue remains: the TV appears slightly crooked.  This may be because the geometry of my walls is not square.  Watch this space for an update after I take more measurements.  Any other users experience this?", "The price changes on this from day to day, it seems. I got mine for under $60 to the door from Amazon. No reason to pay more; wait it out.When it arrives, you will be a little grumpy about paying that much for a few pieces of metal.BUT. I must say, this was a BREEZE to install. Made getting the TV on the wall simple work indeed. So...well worth it.", "I've had this wall mount (sf660) for 2 weeks..I want to tell anyone thinking of purchasing this wall mount.Go for it, this wall mount rocks. I installed it in less than 30 minutes..I had marked where the wallstuds were..so I just predrilled the holes, and attached it to the wall. Right now I'm waiting for the delivery of my new flat screen t.v. which I ordered from Amazon (who else?) I called peerless (their 800 number) to makesure that this wall mount would work with the t.v.  I ordered a Samsung LN52B750 (great price Amazon)and i'm sure it will all be fine.....Willie"], "Gamma": [0.12220457196235657, 0.12220363318920135, 0.1445932388305664, 0.12220363318920135, 0.12220363318920135, 0.12220363318920135, 0.12218404561281204, 0.12220363318920135], "Beta": [[0.5442286133766174, 0.022980161011219025, 0.06531140208244324, 0.0002480626862961799, 0.00041246585897170007, 0.2205413430929184, 0.007259672973304987, 0.13699041306972504, 0.0020277947187423706], [0.5442298650741577, 0.02297965995967388, 0.06531116366386414, 0.0002481040428392589, 0.0004124980769120157, 0.22054164111614227, 0.007259605918079615, 0.13698983192443848, 0.0020276871509850025], [0.5454694628715515, 0.02476629801094532, 0.06452424824237823, 6.550110265379772e-05, 0.00020010523439850658, 0.2167791724205017, 0.006792148575186729, 0.1387919932603836, 0.0026110855396836996], [0.5442298650741577, 0.02297965995967388, 0.06531116366386414, 0.0002481040428392589, 0.0004124980769120157, 0.22054164111614227, 0.007259605918079615, 0.13698983192443848, 0.0020276871509850025], [0.5442298650741577, 0.02297965995967388, 0.06531116366386414, 0.0002481040428392589, 0.0004124980769120157, 0.22054164111614227, 0.007259605918079615, 0.13698983192443848, 0.0020276871509850025], [0.5442298650741577, 0.02297965995967388, 0.06531116366386414, 0.0002481040428392589, 0.0004124980769120157, 0.22054164111614227, 0.007259605918079615, 0.13698983192443848, 0.0020276871509850025], [0.5442226529121399, 0.022981071844697, 0.0653129443526268, 0.0002481195842847228, 0.0004125413834117353, 0.22054265439510345, 0.007260299287736416, 0.1369917392730713, 0.002027884591370821], [0.5442298650741577, 0.02297965995967388, 0.06531116366386414, 0.0002481040428392589, 0.0004124980769120157, 0.22054164111614227, 0.007259605918079615, 0.13698983192443848, 0.0020276871509850025]]}
