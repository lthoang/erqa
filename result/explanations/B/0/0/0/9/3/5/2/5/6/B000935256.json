You'll know the basics of the engine as well as the common button combinations inherent in the genre.If you're not familiar with fighting games of this kind, then this game will be a difficult experience; hell, it's a challenge for advanced players just starting the game. The learning curve on this game is extremely high. You need to have great eyesight and blindingly fast reflexes as you'll need to time button combinations perfectly in order to get what you're aiming for. This game is no simple button-masher. You must learn a lot of these techniques in order to advance in the game. There is a rewarding feeling that comes though, when you feel you've mastered some of the tougher techniques.The game-play itself is solid, with plenty of options to choose from, including a strategy game called Chronicles of the Sword involving a character you create( which is another great option to the play of this game). You must go through the strategy game in order to earn money and new equipment to create better characters later in the game. To go with that are all the individual story lines you can follow in Tales of Souls mode. There's your basic World Competition mode (tournaments and league fighting) along with Soul Arena, an arcade mode that has a number of small mini-games you can play and earn money in. Museum mode lets you explore your previously earned rewards. Plus, you can practice and go through a much needed tutorial.Like all Soul Calibur games, this game has the weaponry system that adds something to the fighting genre. You play to attain more weapons that can give your character better abilities as well as strengthening his or her attacks, something you'll need as you progress in some of the games. Though the list of moves a character can perform is relatively small, it does make the game a little easier to handle, especially since some of the moves are situational--can only be used at special times. When you're tired of doing the same moves, just pick a new character. This game is loaded with them at the very start but with unlock-ables the list becomes huge, adding replay value to many of the game modes.I highly recommend this game to fans of the 3D fighting genre. It's isn't for everyone because of the learning curve, but for those willing to accept a challenge, I recommend you also.", "To begin with, theres a huge amount of unlockable content in this game. You will be unlocking new costumes, characters, weapons and things every single day you play... for weeks!This is an awesome addition to fighting games, which i feel lose their replayability too quick.The new content adds a lot to an already jam packed game.Theres 30 characters to take through story mode and theres a giant strategy/fighting side game called chronicles of the sword. This side game took me 12 hours to get through. Thats a pretty decent chunk for a side game.Theres also a decent amount of fun little games in the mode called Soul Arena though some of the games are a bit too difficult.The thing that seems a little screwy in this game and is its biggest flaw is its AI. This game has no difficulty adjuster so the game is always locked in the same difficulty. The AI is extremely smart, or cheap, and can string together fast moves and reactions that a human opponent cant. Its extremely lame to lose 75% of your life bar to one string of cheap attacks by the computer.But strangely, even though the computer AI is very good and cheap, there are some basic moves which the computer just cannot block. Want to beat the game without losing a single battle? Pick Sophitia and just keep pressing triangle.Its very lame that the computer will block and dodge the most advanced tactics but cannot block the most basic move. Its funny to see the hidden final boss, Night Terror, get beat with the most basic attack in the game.While this game is boatloads of fun and an awesome fighter, it still isnt without a few flaws because of its strange and unbalanced AI. And thats what makes it 4 stars, and not a perfect 5 in my books.", "\"Soul Calibur, as most gamers know, is one of the best fighting games ever made. Soul Calibur 2, which made its way to multiple platforms back in 2003, kept it's great gameplay, modes, and other significant features to keep it's the high profile of the franchise. As a major Soul Calibur fan, I'm very disappointed to say that Soul Calibur 3 doesn't have quite the \"\"caliber\"\" that made its predecessors such great fighting masterpiece.The graphics, while it's almost identical to that of Soul Calibur 2, is still beautiful and detailed, and I'm actually quite glad that this factor was kept as it is. Last thing I would want to see is Namco trying something new only to end up developing a bad game.The sound is also actually very similar, but you guys should probably don't take my words into consideration (just my sound section) because I am one of those gamers who gets too deeply involved to even worry about sound. I still think that it's done pretty well, considering that I've heard a lot of worse in game soundtracks as well as sounds itself.Gameplay is where many changes have been done. First of all, many of the modes seem new and different, but are badly executed for the most part as the gamespot reviewer also said. Some moves also seems to be changed as my favorite character Mitsurugi was doing some weird moves instead of the old crazy move that I used to do on the original Soul Calibur and on Soul Calibur 2, no matter how much I kept on spamming only to realize a few minutes later that the moves have been changed. This makes me more angry every time I think about how hard I tried to master Mitsurugi's moves. My other big disappointment was the change of modes and menu designs, as it was a lot harder and confusing to access to different options. Speaking of confusing, the mode Tales of Chronicles was also confusing and extremely dull for the most part. Lastly, I noticed that the game has gotten more difficult than previous games but then again, maybe I forgot to change the difficulty setting to easy. Though I remember ignoring doing so because I think I read someone's review about difficulty options not existing. That will be the first thing I'm going to check next time I play Soul Calibur 3. I guess other factors of gameplay such as responsiveness of controls, intensity of gameplay, and addictiveness of multi player mode are all still the same as before.Value actually depends on the person. Personally, I find the new modes extremely retarded, therefore replay value goes down on my part. For someone else who likes to try new approaches might favor the inclusion of new modes. But then again, it's still very engaging to try to unlock all the features of the game and to play with friends. Sadly, I can play with friends only so often as most are PC gamers. If they added an online mode (why didn't they? PS2 is online enabled...) I think I would totally forget about the new uninspiring modes (because I love fighting random people) and therefore, give replay value a full 10/10. However, that's not the case and I'd say it would only be about 8/10 if I had to score it.As for the tilt, being a fan of Soul Calibur series, I'd say I still like it despite the fact that there are some main features (what made Soul Calibur so great) that are missing (arcade mode and battle mission mode from original Soul Calibur) and disappointing new features that are added. I continuously play game since I bought it last month and I am still enjoying it. So I guess I'm more in favor of this game.Finally, if I had to recommend this game to anyone, I would recommend it to only Soul Calibur fans and hardcore fighting gamers who likes variety. If you have never tried Soul Calibur, then you are better off buying used Soul Calibur 2 for $5 than paying $20 to get Soul Calibur 3. (well, I got mine for $8.99 at gamestop because it was in clearance. I don't know about other gamestop stores or gamestores. I'm just assuming that it's $20. but either way, I doubt that used SC3 is $5)BUT...if you have extra cash, try to get a Dreamcast and get the original Soul Calibur because I'm telling you, it's the one of the best damn fighting games ever made. In the end, I'm recommending Soul Calibur 1 to all newbies to this franchise.\"", "This game is fun just like part2 is but this one is better. More characters more stages and great graphics. The storymode was fun to and i beat it, it's was more better then soulcalibar2's storymode cause that one was hard but this one was a little easier. The attacks are the same but just some new ones for the old characters but this game was fun.", "\"SCIII is a very entertaining action/fighting game.  The variety of characters and their wide array of battle moves are impressive.  Each of the characters possess weapons that have their own peculiarities and specialties.  As a result, even though the settings are recycled over and over, you will still be able to fight repeatedly without getting bored.  You can use different characters each time you play the game.  My advise here is to become competent using one character before moving on to using another.  The number of possible attack moves per character ensures that you will always have something to learn. To me, the best feature of this game is that you can also create your own characters and dress them up the way you would like to.  The attacks available to your created characters will be determined by the type of weapon they carry.The one aspect of the game that kept me from giving it a higher score is the fact that the battle program is inconsistent.  I agree with some of the comments stating that this is a challenging game.  However, there is nothing wrong with that.  A challenging game is fun and you get a feeling of accomplishment when you finally make progress.  But you do want the game to be consistent.  You do want the game to challenge you and force you to master moves.  However, the problem with this game is that this idea is applied inconsistently throughout the battles.  To use a particular example, let's talk about Talim.  I first used Siegfried to fight Talim.  I was landing heavy blows, they were connecting, and my button presses were timed properly.  Siegfried was executing his moves properly.  I was \"\"chaining\"\" attack after attack.  Talim was stunned and was taking a lot of punishment.  Yet, she would not go down.  And then Talim lands one kick and one swipe and the next thing you know, Siegfried was knocked out! I have beaten Talim numerous times, in different modes, using Siegfried, Raphael, Ivy, and my own character.  During those many battles, I noticed the inconsistency.  It seemed to me like the game responds slowly during some battles, like there was a built-in lag in the battle system.  I noticed this when fighting against Talim and Sheong-Mina.  My characters were moving and behaving like they were in slow-motion against them.  However, they respond and react normally when playing other enemies.  It's almost like the game developers chose them to be the favored characters and added a built-in disadvantage to your player.  It really isn't the fact that the game is indeed challenging, it's the fact that you are automatically at an unfair disadvantage against these two characters.I wanted to make sure that I have the right moves and that there was nothing that I was doing to handicap myself.  I consulted an online guide.  I also bought the Strategy Guide.  Following the advice from those sources, I used the suggested moves to keep Talim from getting close.  Again, the fact that my character became sluggish against Talim made this difficult.  The strategy is sound.  Keep a short range enemy at a distance, and use your superior \"\"reach\"\" to do damage.  The lag between my commands and the system's response kept me from accomplishing my strategy.This is a fun game.  However, heed what some of the reviewers are saying about the battle system, or AI as one reviewer mentioned.  There is that inconsistency, which is almost like a system \"\"cheat\"\".  I have a feeling that this is what the other reviewers meant when they said that there is something wrong with the battle system.  As much as I like the game, I find that one aspect to be a big negative.The game allows you to create your own custom fighter.  You can actually create a fighter that looks exactly like KOS-MOS (the main character from the Xenosaga RPG series) by using the Type X armor.\"", "I have this, but it's so NOT memorable, that I can't even remember enough about it to review it.", "\"Simply put this is the best fighting game on any platform to date. Just as Tekken has gone vastly downhill and is a dying franchise soul calibur has taken its time to release only 4 games (one was a saturn port), yet each has been better than the last. It has rightly gotten great reviews, and sold past the magic million mark easily.The main character stories have been even more improved and are now called tales of the soul. You travel on a world map and can make different choices depending on who you meet and what you do. There are also fully animated cutscene endings for all the characters, along with different outcomes depending on how you do and if you take certain actions. E.g A character in a scene might launch a giant cog at you and up flashes the button press you need to make to avoid it (like resident evil 4). The whole experience is very polished and its only part of the whole package. Superb.There is a challenge section where you can face giant greek gods or race to collect coins. I won't spoil them as some are very inventive and they never feel like \"\"space fillers\"\".A major part of soul calibur 3 is the chronicles of the sword mode mode. This is like an rpg with weapon and armour collection and party members. You play a young recruit in a vast army who though his/her actions can shape the world and history. It's very well made and there is lots to do in it. You can attack the enemy strongholds in groups or switch to vs mode and fight enemies in traditional soul calibur matches. You issue orders to knights, ninjas, infantry etc and many famous SC characters make an appearance. It's a big improvement on the weapon master mode of part 2. Top class. Did I mention that you create your own character with so much variety it puts most PC rpgs to shame, you can chose their class, their wardrobe (hundreds of items), their weapons, even down to eye colour and hundreds of shades to pick.There's a great tutorial, a large tournament mode for various trophies as well as the excellent shops to buy weapons, armour and items from (all stafed by very attractive women!). An art gallery, exibition theater.....etc..etc. This will last you months and months.9/10\"", "From the guys who brought you tekken come soul calibur III. Being relesed six years after Soul Calibur, this game satisfies the hungry fans of the series.Featuring about thirty fighters, not to mention the option to create your own fighter. Modes include, arcade, chronicles of the sword, which is like sc II's weapon master mode. and a featured story mode.With the choices you have it will make this game fun for months on end. A great buy for any fighting game fan.", "\"Soul Calibur III is the latest release in a great line of fighting games. The graphics are really impressive, and the character customization adds a great new dimension to fighting gameplay.There are whole complex back-stories to all of the characters, developed over the game series. You can go into the 'museum' in this game to learn all about that, if you haven't been keeping up with the series. That will help you really understand the interactions between the characters. It's like being a part of a complex, epic story.The graphics are simply gorgeous. There are pirate ships, where the floor moves and sways beneath you. There are elegant Chinese temples with mosaic tile floors and lovely mountains in the background. You've got renaissance mansions in flames, cages in grimy port towns, and much more. Each environment has moving elements to add to the realism.The sounds are pretty traditional. Most of it is BASH - SMASH - YAAAAH! along with the background music, themed to match the environment. I do love this kind of background music far better than games that have rock music.Gameplay itself has good and bad points. On the good side, there are a GREAT combinations you can learn for your character, so if you are diligent you can come up with awesome fighting sequences. You can learn which combos match well against your enemy's weaknesses and exploit them. On the other hand, if you're more the type that likes to button mash, you can have a fair amount of success with that, although you will get frustrated in the higher level battles.The game is marked for teens, although it's far more tame than other fighting games I've seen. Many of the females *gasp* actually wear clothing. There really isn't any blood involved in the combat, although  some parents argue that little tykes shouldn't see swinging swords and flails at all. There's no swearing.That being said, the game is fairly challenging, and unlike the previous game, there's no way to set the difficulty up or down. If you play one on one you can adjust the difficulty so the younger person can have an easier time, but for regular gameplay you're stuck with \"\"hard\"\". I find this to be a shame. While experienced players will get along OK, it really would've been nice for new players to have an 'easy' option to go through the game in, to learn the game and have fun. They could always have upgraded through 'normal' and 'hard' later on.With the customizeable characters and multitude of opponents, you can really replay this game for months without getting bored with it. There are always new combinations to learn and perfect. Well recommended!Rating: 4.5/5\"", "Soul Caliber 3 - Circa 2005GOOD:- Good/Tight controls- Really balanced gameplay- Lots of different and unique fighters- Minutes to learn years to master gameplay- Literally TONS content to unlock such as new Fighters, costume pieces, stages, and extra modes of play- A 3D fighting game that really uses the 3D space (with eight way run)- Three all new characters- All returning characters from Soul Caliber 1 and 2 have their move sets/styles upgraded and slightly changed (in most case for the better)- A nice upgrade over the original Soul Caliber 2, which to many gamers is considered classic- Build your own unique characters- Lots of different modes of play from an arcade type mode to the real time strategy mode- Considered an Instant classic to many fans and many hardcore fighting fanaticsBAD:- Some might say that not much has changed (gameplay wise) since Soul Caliber 2- Have to unlock most of the game content like fighters, stages and items through many different modes of play, which takes time and skill (some people do not have either)- Slight lagging in a few areas- Loading is short but present and when buying items or checking out new content it can be annoying- Saving the game (which happens often while trying to unlock new content) takes a bit of time alsoIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Has medieval theme, both European and Chinese/Japanese- Not traditional fighting game in the sense that there is no real combos and supers, or even projectile moves- Game has built in quest type mode, where you pick a fighter and complete a number of challenges in a type of semi arcade mode (with story), the end result is you unlock more content and are a better player- Fight with weapons, like a 3D Samurai Showdown type of game or a Tekken/Dead or Alive with weapons- Build your own unique characters (pretty much costume only, you pick a pre-set fighting style) and fight with them in versus modes and Chronicles of the Sword mode, (Lots of the new items and costume parts should be unlock to really get a better selection of costume accessories, not much to pick at default)- New different modes of play like Chronicles of the Sword mode you fight in a type of real time strategy game (using your custom character) which plays out like a tactic game when instead of turn based battling it's fighting game battling, then there is even a World Tour mode where you fight in mock tournaments- Lots and lots of stuff to unlock from new fighters to new costume items for your custom characterGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Soul Caliber 2- Tekken 5- Samurai ShowdownADDITIONAL NOTES:- This game is only for Sony's Playstation 2 unlike Soul Caliber 2 which was also for Xbox and Game Cube, note you can still get Soul Caliber 2 for a pretty cheap price and it's a also a great game- This game came with a pretty lame demo disc, which in my opinion neither adds nor takes away anything from the entire over all experience of Soul Caliber 3, although it should be noted that this demo disc has all unlocked content for Tekken Tag, Tekken 4 and Xenosaga (the original)- I am going wish that a version comes to Xbox-360, which would be cool :: Crossing Fingers Now ::", "Great Play station 2 game for everyone. Kids love it  took my 7 year old about twenty minutes to master the game.Has some graphic violence but mainly just a fighting game", "The first difference between this and Tekken is weapons. This was the only difference to beign with but in the end this has come out on top.Firstly is the amazingly good character creator system which may not be as detailed as other games (Tony Hawk games are quite accurate) it still feels really satisfying to watch your creation slice up classics like Voldo and Mitsurugi. Nice and simple.The modes here are very varied for those who have time and for those who just want quick relief. For those who really want depth there is the long Chronicles of the Sword mode which involves basic strategy with the same beat em up power on the real game. It also has a nice little story in it and although the strategy system isn't revolutionary it is enough to keep you entertained. Another mode is the Tales of the Souls, which is like the arcade mode but what you choose affects who you fight against; however after you've played it a few times you'll realise that everyone's story is very similar and the only thing seperating them is the ending. The other mode is Arena mode which is basically a random choice of very random modes (fighting a giant statue!?) that are used for quick relief and addictive gameplay which is what they do best.The characters in this series is literally the entire set. Although there aren't many ? squares in the selection process there is a small area where they've shoved random old characters (does anyone remember Li Long and Hwang?) along with some random other characters. One of the biggest selections so far.Overall...buy it if you have a craving for a good beat em up. If you don't like it then you don't like beat em ups so that's not my problem; everyone else is welcome though.", "I loved Soul Calibur 2 for the Xbox and for all the same reasons, I love SC 3 for the PS2.  It has great replay value both as a single player and playing against friends.  It has great gameplay with smooth framerates and some new characters.  It is only 480p, so it is not quite as sharp as the 720p Xbox version of SC 2, but it still looks great.  If you loved SC 2, then it is worth getting SC 3.", "\"The Soul series has been a staple in fighting games since SoulBlade was originally released on the Playstation several years ago.  The original SoulCalibur redefined a genre.  SoulCalibur II was more of a refinement of that.  This makes stepping into SoulCalibur III something of a conundrum.  The game has a lot to compare to.  SoulCalibur III is more along the lines of being the same old same old.  On the other hand what keeps it down is its kitchen sink approach.  It's a fun and grand game, but they added in just a little too much this time around.  The game is robust and huge, providing a fantastic single player experience, but much of it you're likely to bypass in favor of just getting your friends together and fighting.Story hasn't always been SoulCalibur's strong suit.  On the other hand the characters often times have been.  The relationships and their motivations for seeking Soul Edge to either obtain it or destroy it have always been amusing.  Likewise so have their relationships to other characters.  It has been the bread and butter of SoulCalibur.  It has been what has made the characters fun.  Reading their biographies, and about the levels and environments has always been what has made SoulCalibur stand out in terms of a narrative.  Listening to them talk in battle or watching the story itself play out hasn't always been.SoulCalibur II had a very simple approach to how things went within the story and whatnot.  You played through Arcade mode with various characters in an effort to see different stories and endings.  SoulCalibur III tries for an actual story mode that, for the most part, does a valiant effort, but gets rather annoying at times.  You select a character and begin.  There are branching paths in the story but the end result usually doesn't change much.  Especially because every character's story essentially follows the same arc.  You might go to different locations and fight different characters, but some moments will play out exactly the same.  That's not to say there is no unique nature to it.  The final boss is always different... as are the various endings.  Every character has different endings that are dependent on a button input.  You're more likely to play the story for the sake of completion, but once you go through with the fifth or sixth character, it starts to feel repetitive and boring.  It's not as quick as a typical Arcade mode and some of the exposition and dialog is just silly and not needed.  Likewise, there are some cutscenes that throw in quick time events.  That's right, quick time events... in a fighting game.  But not for the actual fight.  In cutscenes that predate fights.  And at first they can be confusing as they'll say things like \"\"G\"\" (as in, press the Guard button... not \"\"Press the X Button\"\").  You'll quickly get used to it, but it's a wonder why you'd have to bother with them to begin with.For the most part, fighting is the same.  There have been some new moves added and a few moves are easier to pull off, but it's more or less a refined version of the combat you saw in SoulCalibur II.  Battling is very familiar.  If you played SoulCalibur II or the original SoulCalibur you'll know what to expect.  What might throw some, however, is that the difficulty has been ramped up a lot for this outing.  Each story starts off relatively simple enough, but there are times it's unbalanced.  With AI controlled opponents sometimes being able to predict your moves perfectly, or pulling off moves that can feel almost gamebreaking at times.  It's a real test of skill... but sometimes you're apt to lose out on a battle mostly due to bad luck rather than because you're actually not that good.  It certainly proves that SoulCalibur is not the button masher people think it is, however.  It'll get you nowhere when going through SoulCalibur III's various story modes.As I said, there seems to be a Kitchen Sink approach to SoulCalibur III.  Aside from the story mode there is also a Chronicles of the Sword, which has you create a character and traverse a map in a similar style to a strategy RPG.  The problem here is that it's relatively boring.  There doesn't feel like much to do and there aren't that many SoulCalibur style battles to get into.  There is also a missions mode, but it's hardly as expansive as SoulCalibur II's weapons master mode.  Then there is the Quick Battle mode which is effectively the game's Arcade Mode.  And like the previous two games there are lots of galleries and such to unlock.  You can also purchase several weapons from the shop etc.There isn't a whole lot that keeps SoulCalibur III down.  The unbalanced AI can certainly cause problem, but it's not impossible.  SoulCalibur III is at its strongest, however, when you're actually playing with friends.  You can't setup battles against the computer on your own, but get a friend together and SoulCalibur III showcases a lot of fighting chops.  Here, you might find some can win with button mashing, but if anyone takes the time to learn the ins and outs of SoulCalibur's fighting system it's a surprisingly complex and fun game.  There aren't that many fighting games that offer up the same kind of multiplayer fun.  SoulCalibur III is at its best when played in this manner.  That's not to say the single player experience is no fun.  SoulCalibur in general excels in this regard.  SoulCalibur III most certainly has the best single player experience to date... but it also has some of the most frustrating AI to fight against sometimes.  It also throws in far too many characters that are mainly clones or tweaks of pre-existing characters.  A great single player experience, but it doesn't separate from the fact that unlike SoulCalibur II... SoulCalibur III isn't nearly as much to play by yourself with the AI being unbalanced the way it is from time to time.  Even experts at SoulCalibur may have to take some time to really study their opponents before finally getting things going.  Skill is still a requirement... but luck isn't exactly a skill.  It is definitely a game that was designed with the Arcade in mind (as in, it's designed to crush you).  On the one hand, that also makes SoulCalibur III a good challenge.  Master it and you're likely to learn a lot and compete in tournaments (not to mention future installments).  It's a double-edged sword.Visually Namco will never skimp on a SoulCalibur game.  And SoulCalibur III looks absolutely amazing.  Giving off some of the best level design and character models you'll find on the Playstation 2.  Music wise there's a lot of good stuff here as well.  The music is great.  Some tracks are pulled from SoulCalibur II, but that's fine in and of itself.  The sound effects are also really good.  There are few fighting games that look this good.Overall, SoulCalibur III is a fantastic game for fighters.  It isn't quite up to the good graces of SoulCalibur II.  And there are certain things that feel either out of place (Chronicles of the Sword) or like they have no place in SoulCalibur at all (Quick Time Events) but the game is still an extremely good one that any fan of the franchise will enjoy.\"", "\"Soul Calibur 3 is definitely one of the best games to his the Playstation 2 for 2005-06. It features extremely polished and well done graphics, a well augmented fighting engine (compared to the engine of SC2 which had some complaints), and plenty of replay value with it's enhanced single player modes.One of the negatives that the game faces is that after the \"\"guest character\"\" extravaganza of Soul Calibur 2, people were expecting there to be a guest character on Soul Calibur 3. Sadly, we haven't had any such luck, but thankfully Namco had put in a \"\"Create-A-Character\"\" mode in place of the \"\"guest character\"\".The create-a-character mode is very well done, and allows you to create a plethora of video game and anime characters, as well as almost anyone else you could possibly imagine. The only drawbacks to the create-a-character mode is that you cannot fine-tune the faces as much as you can on games such as the WWE games, and you have to unlock most of the costume parts and features of the create-a-character mode. To unlock said parts and features, one must play through the game's \"\"Tale of Souls\"\" and \"\"Chronicles of the Sword\"\" mode.Tales of Souls is the single player story mode in Soul Calibur 3, and it is another place in the game where some negative comments have been stirred up. These negatives are due to the fact that you cannot change the difficulty of ToS, and as a result it starts out easy and quickly goes to extremely frustrating as the computer will become VERY aggressive and block/counter just about every move you throw at it. It is still beatable, but this is a major hamper on players who are new to Soul Calibur. Aside from this negative, ToS is very entertaining, and features a rather well fleshed out storyline for each of the characters in the game, which is somewhat unusual for a fighting game. It allows you to chose your own path, and make different choices in the cut-scenes, depending on what buttons you press. As a result, you can influence how well you will do in the preceding fights, as well as change the very ending for each character.Chronicles of the Sword is the \"\"adventure\"\" mode of the game, and it plays similar to that of a RPG/Strategy game like Shining Force. The only difference is that when your units get into a fight, they duke it out via Soul Calibur's fighting engine instead of via an rpg battle. This mode is creative, although it's storyline is a little non-existent. Still, it is enjoyable, and is worth playing if you wish to unlock most of the in-game content.Overall, SC3 is a pleasant surprise despite the short amount of time that the game took to make. It features some of the best graphics you will ever find on a PS2 game, and it plays well to boot. This game is definitely recommended for anyone who is a fighting game fan.\"", "\"Ok, so I bought Soul Calibur 3 after buying and absolutely disliking Soul Calibur 2, so therefore I guess it reasons that my disappointment with this game is my own fault.First I am going to start off with the good aspects.  The game is beautifully crafted, the backgrounds are absolutely magnificent, the characters are beautifully developed and the graphics and frame rates are by all token beyond amazing.  When the characters are fight they are flawless, their moves, combat and actions are seamless and there is not a skip or a frame miss between them.  The backgrounds are much more developed than in SC2, and they even allow you to manipulate the scenery, for instance if a fighter hits a wall it will break ect.  Next the game is filled to the hilt with tons of extras, tons of mini games, and you are able to buy and absolute plethora of weapons, armor and items, almost mirroring the final fantasy series in a great way.  Lastly the music isn't bad and the story line is pretty good too although it an get convoluted at times.  Finally, I absolutely love that you can build your own character, but I hate that you are relegated to the weapons and moves that the dictator computer forces on you.Now for the negatives which unfortunately far outweigh the positives.  As amazing and as wonderful as the above aspects are, they really dont make the game fun, and for me a video game needs to be fun for me to enjoy it, it needs to entertain me, not give me rage and frustrate my like this game does.  My contention with this game comes in the following areas.(1) The games difficulty is absolutely ridiculous and is not made with common gamers in mind.  I am not serious about video games, I play them to pass the time or on my train commute, but this game is developed for serious gamers and this is clearly reflected in the lack of difficulty settings.  No, \"\"easy\"\" mode or \"\"medium\"\" for guys like me, only hard for the fan boys.(2)The AI is completely unbalanced.  One stage is super easy, the next one is super hard, than followed by easy and so forth in a random order.  This is angering when I am getting my butt handed to me in the first stage because I got stuck against a genius AI.  At least with MK the game gets harder as you progress, and as you get better, this is completely random.  Also how the hell can a massive behomoth such as Asteroth deal tiny amounts of damage, but a little shrimpy girl like Taki can deal mass amounts of damage and over whelm you?  Yea, someone is a feminist!(3)Like in SC2, the computer can pull of these ridiculous moves that you can not even dream of pulling off.  When you get stuck fighting against a hard AI, the computer will have you bouncing in the air for 6 or 7 hits with 3/4 of your life gone before you even know what happened to you.  The computer will block you every 20 seconds and you wont get a good hit in at all, and it will pull off a counter every 3 seconds as is the same with breaking your grabs, but you as the player can forget about any of that, the probability of you timing it right is 1/1,000,000.(4) Who ever designed the characters, clearly had favorites in mind and was by all means close to being a feminist.  All of the female characters are far better than the male characters, are far faster, stronger, more elegant and the computer works their AI much better.  Also when fighting Mitsarugi's AI, he was clearly a favorite of the developers as his fighter wether it is your first or 10th fight is unbeatable and is insanely hard to beat.(5) What the hell, they got rid of all of the great charatcter moves and replaced them with boring moves.  For instance, Ivy cant swing her sword/whip around any more with the L2 button, instead she just stabs.. BORING.. On the upside Taki has a good move where she stabs the ground, with L2 so i guess the got rid of great moves and added some good ones.. Leave the great ones and add more great ones! Also, some of the fighter's outfits are just plain dumb, I think they were better fashioned in SC2.  Asteroth looked better in SC2, as did Taki (I hate her mask).(6) Chronicles of the sword is so dumb, childish and pointless.  I hated the weapon master in SC2 because of its difficulty, but this puts it to shame, makes me love WM.(7) This game is all about practice.  If you have the time to practice and play for 8 hrs a day like a good fan boy should than you will have no problem mastering the moves and combos.  But if you are like me and you are getting a degree, working and conducting a personal life, you can forget about getting anywhere in the game.(8) The memory card currupts if you save another game after playing Chron of the Sword.  This is kind of idiotic considering that I really dont feel like paying for 2 memory cards just to have an entire card for one game that genuinely dislike.I gave this game an additional star becuase its good aspects are phenominal.  Unfortunately none of the good parts make the game enjoyable or fun.  This game is so hard and so frustrating that you will either put it down in a minute or you will toss your controller out the window in sheer rage.  If you have time to invest in practice and all that BS buy this game, but dont buy into the little fan boys and girls about how great this game is.  If you are like me and are a suckie,  casual gamer, this game is not for you, if you are a great gamer.. go for it.CASUAL GAMERS BEWARE... SC3 DOES NOT HAVE US IN MIND!!! WE DONT EXIST!!!\"", "\"The game is pretty, and it's fun to play with friends, although some of the added gameplay dynamics are frustrating: namely that once you're on the ground, you can expect to get hit 6-7 more times before you can so much as regain your footing, and even then, you're on the defensive for the rest of the match.The biggest problem with this game is that the single player, which you're practically forced to play if you ever want to unlock weapons/characters/armor, etc is awful.The main reason is the computer AI.  Enemies vary between being 100% flawless (all of your moves are blocked, if not guard impacted, all of your throws negated, even though there should only be a 50% chance of that if someone's even fast enough to attempt negating it), and being 100% worthless.  It punishes you for even trying to fight, because immediately after the enemy blocks your attack, he immediately counters with a lightning fast move before you can block it (even moves that knock an enemy off balance don't protect you from this counter attack).The enemy alternates between sitting completely still and not trying to block anything, to becoming completely impossible to harm at all; there is no in between.  Skill is irrelevant, as I can beat computer opponents just as well with the character i've used since soul caliber 1 (which i consider myself quite skilled with) as with a new character who's moves I have no idea to enact (which I admit I am god awful with).  This is because any hit you get off the computer is because it allowed you hit it.  Tactics, switch moves, throwing off balance, fakeouts, etc do absolutely nothing against the computer.  You're as likely to strike the computer with the most comnplicated and flawlessly executed maneuver in the history of fighting games as you are by closing your eyes and mashing the triangle button (try it, it works).Second reason is massive load times.  Trying to play through story mode makes you wait 15 seconds to load out of a battle into the map screen, 15 seconds to wait for the next text box, 15 seconds again to load into battle mode, and then it makes you watch every damn cinematic on the way though.Chronicles of the sword seemed like an intersting new game, but once again suffers the same problems as the other single player modes, some of which are even worse here.  Frequent loading saps any amount of inensity the game might hold, and the rediculous difficulty of the computer AI is magnified here.  Everyone in this mode gets \"\"levels\"\" 1-60.  You start at level 1ish, and fight opponents usually ranging from lv 7-60.  Higher the levels, the more health/damage they have/do.  Also, just to spice things up, battles frequently have an effect like \"\"all the attacks the enemy makes are unblockable\"\", or \"\"any hits you make against the enemy don't slow him down\"\".  These benefits only occur for whoever controls the tower, and since 95% of it is you attacking towers, not defending, these benefits rarely if ever get applied to you.With all of this complaining, you might wonder why I gave the game 3 stars.  Remember, this is only the single player mode.  Multiplayer is still relatively fun.  It also suffers from load times (especially when picking characters and trying to see what they look like), and the problem with once you're on the floor you're pretty much a goner, but is otherwise loads of fun.  Once you go through the root canal of single player to unlock the characters that is.\"", "\"I would agree with anybody that the 1999 Soul Calibur on Dreamcast was a Masterpiece. I really loved that game. But that was 6 years ago!There is nothing new about Soul Cabibur 3. It's just the same old stuff that you had already played for hundreds of hours years ago.There are a few new moves and combos, but the new moves just turn the game into a \"\"Button Masher\"\". Which means you can easily  beat the game by rapidly mashing the attack button. The previous games made you think a little about your strategy, but now there is NO strategy or real skill involved.Plus it's on Playstation, so you know what type of graphics your getting (the worst graphics out of the 3 systems).\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.011542427353560925, 0.09658924490213394, 0.0019920591730624437, 0.08769086748361588, 0.05212266370654106, 0.1074715182185173, 0.1103399470448494, 0.005467717535793781, 0.0010097025660797954, 0.011550934053957462, 0.13911917805671692, 0.07187522202730179, 0.0014085365692153573, 0.047502271831035614, 0.014633787795901299, 0.037309836596250534, 0.16912305355072021, 0.0332510881125927]]}
