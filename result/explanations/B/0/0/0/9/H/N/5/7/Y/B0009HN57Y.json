I am an advanced amateur photographer that shoots strictly for enjoyment-no $$$ in it for me. With a few nice lenses-85mm 1.4D, 300 f/4 EDIF-AF, 60 2.8D macro, and Sigma 150 2.8 macro-I have experience with quality glass.With the introduction of the 55-200 VR, this lens has lost much popularity. You can probably find a good deal on a used one now. If you can do without VR and want a good telephoto zoom on a tight budget, this will fit the bill.The performance of the 55-200 impressed me. As far as sharpness is concerned, it is sharp even at wide open aperture. At 200mm and f/5.6, it can just about hang with the big boys(most zooms perform weakest at longest focal length and widest f stop). Contrast was not quite as good as pro lenses, but I'm splitting hairs. And nowdays, you can adjust contrast in editing software or in the camera, so it's not really an issue. I can't speak for chromatic abberation performance because the D300 automatically corrects for it.About vignetting, or dark corners, yes it's there at wide open aperture at various focal lengths. The real question is-is it bad? If shooting a white wall, yes it's bad. In the real world-it's not bad. In many shots I took it's not even noticeable. In the sky is included in the image the 2 upper corners with the sky will reveal it. But it's such an easy fix in editing software. To give an example, see my photos posted here at this review. They're birds and squirrels with the caption \"\"shot at 200mm f/5.6 Arthur Storey Park Houston, TX\"\". I don't see any dark corners and they were not corrected for it.Autofocus speed-yes it's a bit slow. That's a common complaint with this lens. If you're serious about shooting action and motorsports, you'd probably be better off with a different lens. But for most situations, it's adequate. And manual focus is a bit difficult thanks to a wafer thin focus ring. But it's not as bad as I thought when I first saw the lens. The 55-200 is an AF-S lens. That means it has a silent wave focus motor built into the lens(and yes it's autofocus compatible with the D40, D40x, and D60). But one gripe is you can't manually override focus by grabbing the ring and turning. On almost all the other Nikkor AF-S lenses, you can do that. But with the 55-200, you have to flip a switch on the lens to get to manual focus.It's a bit cheap when it comes to build quality. With lots of rugged use, it probably wouldn't last too long. But for the casual photographer is should be fine for years to come. It's one of the few lenses with a plastic mount instead of metal. If you change lenses alot like I do, the mount may wear down over time. But it looks like there's just 3 screws holding it in place-probably easy to swap out.The lens grows considerably when zoomed in to 200mm. But at 55mm, it is very compact and does not take up much space at all in the camera bag. It's super light weight. It balances better on the smaller camera bodies like the D40 or D60. On a D300, the setup is a little \"\"back\"\" heavy. It has a 52mm filter thread. That used to be a very common Nikon lens size, so if you have filters from the old days, they may fit. And 52mm filters are inexpensive and widely available.Some say the slow max aperture makes it hard to throw backgrounds out of focus. Just get creative. The longer the focal length, the less depth of field. So instead of taking a portrait at 55 or 70mm, take a few steps back and zoom to 135 or 200. Of course you may not be able to do this indoors in a small room, but outdoors it has potential to get creative images. And be sure the background is far behind your subject to blur it even more. And speaking of out of focus areas, the bokeh of this lens is decent. Not the smoothest, but it's not \"\"choppy\"\" either. Yes the slow max aperture limits you in handheld low light photography with out flash. But these days, camera bodies give good results at high ISOs. In the film days, if you had a 5.6 lens and some 400 or 800 \"\"fast\"\" film, you were very limited. Also if you do alot of low light shooting you need to invest in some glass that's better suited for it.Ok to sum this up, the lens has it's drawbacks, but great images can be had with it-your skills have alot to do with it. In some reviews, this lens gets bashed-don't let that scare you away from it. Were they expecting 70-200 2.8 VR performance for 1/8 of the cost??? At this price point, it's one heck of a value! I just ordered the 70-300 VR lens. But if I didn't need 300mm so much I would have considered the VR version of this lens-much smaller and alot less $$$ than the 70-300.\"", "If you are looking for something relatively inexpensive and fun to carry around, this is the lens for you.  Quality is good in good light, most of the time, and can be exceptional sometimes.  The plasticy feel doesn't bother me because I avoid carrying around a hunk of metal.The VR works like a charm in good light.However, I've noticed softness (at all apertures, including f/8) often enough where I would not use this lens for any professional work.  For example, the Nikkor 180 f/2.8 blows this lens away in quality of manufacture and resulting photos.I've also noticed softness and noise in almost all of my night photos using this lens, even with a very heavy tripod and no wind.The focusing system on the lens also is slow as molasses.  I tried to capture the Blue Angels flying low over the homes in my neighborhood (an awesome annual occurence), and each shot was blown as the lens hunted for focus.  Plenty of good light for high shutter speeds (midday, 1/2500s at f/4), but by the time the lens was focused, the subject had moved so far the photo was blown.If you want to have fun and need a good lens, buy this one.  If you are a professional or OBAM (obessessed amateur), save for the higher quality lenses because you'll be disappointed.  Moving subjects, such as sports or action photography, again not your lens.I wish more people would objectively weigh the positives and the negatives in their reviews so that those considering buying this lens can make an informed decision.  While this is a very good lens on a tight budget, this is not a great lens directly compared against other similar (and more expensive) lenses.", "I use this lens with a D50. This lens captures great photos of my granddaughter and her team playing Fast Pitch softball.  The D50 is set to take continuous shots of action on the field.  Very few of the photos are blurred due to the AF ability.  98% of the photos taken are suitable for printing on quality photo paper.", "I wasn't aware there was a non vibration reduction for the Nikon DSLRs.  I did like the price I got it for but after I received it, discovered that it didn't have the VR feature.  Not a problem...saved about $40 from a similar lens with the VR feature.  I'd planned on using a tripod for it for serious pics, anyway...and I probably won't be disappointed.  Now, as far as the quality of the photos it's taken?  WOW!!!  VERY sharp and clear, corner to corner.  My original lens is a VR 18-55mm that the camera came with, now the 55-200 just extends the zoom.  My next will probably be up to 500mm or so...a zoom lens, of course.", "I just came across an excellent test report on this lens published in Popular Photography. This lens garnered enthusiastic praise for its optical excellence and fine mechanical quality inspite its relatively inexpensive price. By optical excellence I mean that the lens was quite contrasty with superb resolution at both the center and corners of this lens in virtually every focal length from 55mm to 200mm. It is designed to take advantage of the digital sensors in Nikon's digital SLR camera line, of which the ones which will appeal most to amateur users will be the new D50 and the D70s. Nikon was a pioneer in manufacturing zoom lenses back in the 1960s and 1970s, so I am not surprised that this lens has earned such lavish praise.", "I shoot with Nikon d40 and love this lens. I see no reason to spend additional money for VR unless one has very shaky hands. None of my pics have turned out blurry. Picture quality is great, the lens is light and price is just right. For amateurs whom may occasionally shoot sports photos, landscaping, wildlife - this is perfect.", "This lens has been everything expected and then some. I was so happy with the product that I intend to order a wide angle NIKKOR lens as soon as I can.Kuddos to you Amazon on your efficiency in handling this order, and the quality of the product."],
