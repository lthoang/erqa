Here are my observations:Pros -+ Quality Construction; this is a well made case+ Well Padded; the camera compartment is padded and the material will not likely scratch the finish+ Roomy; there is space for my camera, lens cleaning cloth, extra batteries, and memory cards+ Smooth Zippers; good quality zippers that allow one-handed openingCons-- Outer flap protrudes a little more than I would like, but it's not absurdly so- Flimsy Shoulder Strap; but I don't use it anyway so it's not a big deal to meI really like Lowepro cases and this one is everything I have come to expect from them.Highly Recommended!CFH", "I like this Lowepro compact camera case but decided not to use it. It fits a Kodak Zi8 perfectly with a soft interior to prevent scratching. Has a convenient zipper flap just large enough for a spare battery or SD card but not much more than that. Under the strong velcro flap there is enough extra space for a compact basic battery charger but the charger that ships with the Kodak Zi8 has the unfortunate outlet plug that does not fold down so that charger will not work with this case. I like to carry the mini tripod, charger, battery, cleaning felt with my video camera but this bag is not capable. I purchased a slip case for the camera and used a slightly larger bag to carry that and the rest. This way if I only need the camera, I grab that out of the bag and its in the protective sleeve while I roam around for my shots.", "This is the second one of these I've purchased.  I bought a new camera and got this case for it.  It is plenty roomy for the S95 or most other Canon point and shoots.  Some people may think it has too much room.  I like it because in addition to the camera I can fit a couple SD cards, 2 extra batteries and a small card reader in it.  It comes with a strap and can be used on a belt.", "This case seems like just the right size, and there are small zippered pouches for the remote & extra battery. Neat looking & high quality. Very softy lined inside to protect the camera lens & LCD screen.", "Lowepro Ridge 30The Ridge 30 comes in a few colors, but I ended up buying black. There's an external zippered pocket suitable for spare SDHC cards. Flipping open the Velcro flap reveals another open pocket that might store a small cable or extra battery. The camera is accessible by the outside zipper and has plenty of padding all around. The case includes a strap that attaches to two D loops on the corner. There is also a belt loop available.Pros: Decent storage pockets, good size for most cameras (4 x 2.5 x 2 inches), copious internal paddingCons: Needs more pocketsOverall: 4/5 stars", "Item while small is ideal for my point & shoot camera, that I carry when the DSLR's are just not appropriate or available.", "This case is a perfect fit for the Nikon Coolpix P6000 camera.  For a heavier camera, the zipper closure is more secure than the velcro found on most camera bags.  The case doesn't have as much padding as some others, but I prefer that since that makes the case more compact.  A spare battery and spare memory card easily fit into the outside pockets.  Construction quality is very good.  For $10, I can't ask for any more.", "I have purchased several Lowepro products and have never been disappointed. When I need a small case/pouch, this is the brand I look at first. The Ridge 30 is well-made, sturdy and looks nice, too (just like the picture). The only caveat is to make sure that the dimensions are right for whatever you plan to store in it, and err on the side of buying a size too large.  Things tend to fit quite snugly in these cases.  For the price, you can't beat it.", "This is the perfect size for my small camera. It offers the protection you would expect at a minimal cost. I like the soft case so that i can fit it wherever. The front pocket is convenient for an extra battery. There isn't a whole lot of space for the strap and other accessories. If you're looking for something that holds extra cards and such, I'd recommend a larger bag.", "This little case has everything I needed for myPanasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 14.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue):- Right-sized compartment for the camera- pouch for the battery charger- pouch for spare batteries- belt loop- strapI chose the black but it comes in other colors.I like that the belt loop is one-piece - that means it's not going to unsnap or get loose if you snag something. The last thing I want is for my camera to go missing when I am not paying attention because the belt loop came undone.This will also work with many other similar sized Lumix cameras - my wife is using it for herPanasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black).This will keep your camera in better shape, protect it from light to medium knocks, and slight moisture (like walking past a lawn sprinkler or fountain).Great function for the money!", "\"See photos uploaded with product description.  Click on photos for captioned descriptions.The Lowepro Ridge 30 matches beautifully with my Canon SX230 with Clearviewer viewfinder attachment.

I'd guess that something about 4-1/4\"\" x 3\"\" x 1-1/2\"\" would be the maximum sized object that would fit in this particular case.)I carry a couple of spare batteries in the accessories pocket under the flap and a spare SD card in the flap pocket.I specifically purchased the case in the color red to match the color of my camera.  Not an exact match, but close enough.  Love the color, wish my camera came in this shade.Material quality and workmanship is excellent, as are all Lowepro products.The Lowepro Ridge 30 provides just the right combination of size, convenience, protection, quality, and aesthetics to meet my needs.  5 stars.  Highly recommended.\"", "I purchased this case for a Panny FH24. The camera fits well, with a little room to spare. I particularly like the soft microfiber lining inside the main compartment -- which I hope will prevent scratches to the FH24's LCD panel. The neck strap is a little flimsy, and there are no swivel hooks where it attaches to the bag, so sometimes it gets a little tangled. It's also a bit rough against my skin, but not too bad.As someone else pointed out, there's only one zipper for the main compartment, but honestly...that's no biggie for me, since it's a quality zipper that moves smoothly. In the little outside zippered compartment there's just enough room for a spare battery and an extra SDHC card in a protective plastic case. The belt loop is fixed, and that might be an issue for some people, but not for me since I plan on using the neck strap. All in all, for the price, I'm very satisfied. It's a well made, nice looking case that fits my camera, holds essential accessories, and only cost $10 with shipping.", "I got this case after it is recommended by another Amazon.com customer.  I am aware that it will be a little tight.  It is still manageable but takes a little effort fitting the camera and shoulder strap into the storage compartment.  The front pouch is big enough for a spare battery or couple of SD cards.  I am waiting for someone to make a little bigger case to fit all the new advance compact and micro 4/3 cameras."], "Gamma": [0.44388478994369507, 0.5561152100563049], "Beta": [[0.003753778524696827, 0.16586770117282867, 0.1283484399318695, 0.0010929654818028212, 0.039839234203100204, 0.15660394728183746, 0.00014654346159659326, 0.14938610792160034, 0.14152929186820984, 0.0007694028317928314, 0.0941285789012909, 0.0007482687360607088, 0.11778574436903], [0.0032707443460822105, 0.1660947948694229, 0.1287572979927063, 0.0009164515067823231, 0.03818586841225624, 0.1567784696817398, 0.0001381811744067818, 0.14997710287570953, 0.14205843210220337, 0.0006443446618504822, 0.09415235370397568, 0.0006369015900418162, 0.11838903278112411]]}
