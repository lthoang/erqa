Otherwise, if you wanna have motion-sensored fun buy the kinect and if you want a real videogame console buy the xbox360 or the ps3 and do not let nintendo steal the beloved licensed franchises as Zelda, Metroid and Mario by making a 'console' that doesn't even support high definition. Come on nintendo get serious! by making your market bigger, we, the real gamers, owners of nes, snes, n64 and gc are the ones paying the price dont be sooo cheap", "Note that this version does NOT play GameCube games. Apart from that, it's a Wii. It plays Wii games, and there are a bunch of them.", "In my OPINION, this system was not needed, and was only produced because of the XBOX360 AND PS3 emerging.  The GameCube never got on its feet and then the Wii comes out.  It feels like a gimmick that falls flat with the Wii-motes and many peripherals.However, I admit that some games are fun and done well and it does continue the Nintendo tradition.Not long from now, another version of the Wii will be released that is backwards compatible, so don't bother buying this one at all anymore.", "\"...the Wii has exceeded my expectations. Do you want flashy graphics? Look elsewhere. Do you want fun? Find it here, for a price that's easy on the pocketbook.Nintendo has always been about style. The Wii capitalizes on this. I hope the controller is more than a mere hook, but even if it is, what a hook! There is a great synergy (stupid word, I know, but descriptive in this case) between the launch games and the system, something which cannot be said for the bloated PS3. And there is enough novelty here to make it a good alternative to the X-Box 2 (or whatever it's called), which seems now to be hitting its stride.\"\"Zelda\"\" is a great game. There is a bit of a learning curve for the controller, as the X-Box afficionado reported. Indeed, it took me a whole 5 minutes to get comfortable with it. And Wii sports is an excellent package - that comes with the system.Don't overpay, though - I just picked mine up yesterday, and they are beginning to hit the stores. Amazon will have theirs soon, and not for the bloated 500 bucks some people here seem to think they'll get after Christmas.To sum it up, Wii is the most fun system out there at the moment. Ultimately, its lack of processing power will hurt it in the long run, methinks, but for the pricetag and the initial launch, it is the big winner. Happy gaming!\"", "\"Me myself am a \"\"hardcore\"\" gamer. The Gamecube lacked something..The Wii has it.It's extremely fun. Nintendo fans will have a blast. Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Super Mario Bros. There's also the virtual console. For a few hundred points, you can buy older video games,even Sega ones.This is a great buy,the best console of this generation. It has what the others lack. Fun. Pure fun. It has tons of it.This is my favorite console to date, and most defiantly one of the best consoles.It has a better array of games then the other consoles, and is more fun, in my opinion.I highly recommend this, even if you own a PS2, PS3 or 360.\"", "Wii is a solid pickup, plays all gamecube games and the virtual console allows access to a vast catalogue of old games from nes, snes, genesis, and more.", "I feel like this product deserves a review from the perspective as a toy and from the perspective as a video game console.From the perspective of a toy, this system gets a four out of five.  It has plenty of mindless fun good for short bursts of play.  A lot of my friends and family are intrigued by the Wii and always claim to love it, but they never last very long as its like a toy that has lost its luster after a few plays.  However, its can definitely provide family fun for short play periods.  I subtracted a star for the Wii remote being so inaccurate to use.From the perspective of a game system, this system gets a 2 out of five.  It is absolutely terrible.  There is hardly any storage for downloadable games, it is not HD, it does not have good graphics, the motion controls do not work all the time, and its doesn't have any new games.  They are all rehashes (Mario, Super Smash Brothers, Mario Kart . . . all good, but nothing new).  I gave it two star for just how much I have enjoyed Super Smash Brothers Brawl and Tanks on Wii Play (and a few other random fun moments . . . some people like Mario Sunshine Too).Well, I take the average of those two scores and I get a three out of five.  Personally, I am glad I didn't purchase the console, but I am glad my room mate has it for when I want to try something out.For now, I will continue to enjoy my PS3 and 360 (which absolutely destroy the Wii in the realm of gaming, but don't hold a candle to the Wii's ability to get friends and family playing together.)", "\"Ahhh, the Wii.When it was before it's time I drooled like a fanboy at the notion, watching the previews and imagining the possibilities.When it came out I loved me some WiiSports, and fell in love with the Mii channel. I even made a web site about the Wii...Now here I am a year later and I've barely touched it. Sure, Mario Galaxy is fun, and to some degree WiiSports hasn't lost it's charm... and Metroid, oh, wonderful and beautiful Metroid... but alas, this system is collecting dust. It simply doesn't have any of the games the Xbox 360 has been graced with, and it doesn't quite handle Blu Ray movies as well as my PS3.Smash Bros. may get some juice into it's circuit boards for a few weeks, and Mario Kart is coming in \"\"Early 08 - I mean April - I mean Early 09 - I mean...\"\" and that will surely rock.But is it enough?The Wii seems to present a limitless landscape of possibilities for games, but unfortunately, Nintendo doesn't know what the internet is and third-parties don't want to waste time with motion controls or big budget games.The result? It's like handicap children in a playground. It's not fair. It's not fun. It almost makes you feel kind of sad.Verdict? The Wii has nothing going for it. Let the next snaggle-toothed, hype-train-riding, Coca-Cola drinking sell-out buy it instead. It's a better fashion accessory than it is a gaming console.\"", "I have been a nintendo and a mario fan since I was 7 and I must say this is the greatist nintendo console ever and it has alot of decent fun games. I mainly own a wii for mario games such as: mario kart wii, (it's more fun playing online) super mario galaxy, (can't wait for SMG 2) wario's shake it, super smash bros, super mario bros wii + more. my only complaint is that the physical control movements can sometimes make your wrists sore when you constantly shake the controller but other than that I have nothing else to complain about. I don't believe most people want a wii for all that excercising sport crap but the only sport game I love is the wii sports resorts that ones a fun worthy sport game, But I guess the wii is more appealing to alot of old school nintendo fans such as myself and alot of new or mostly older mario fans, but if your not one of those people who are old school nintendo gamers then you will probably not like the nintendo wii at all.Anyway I love the wii and Im proud to be a nintendo veteran.", "You should buy this... NOW! I got one for Christmas and haven't been more impressed with a piece of electronics, ever. It gives you so much for so little money.If you are tired of sitting around doing nothing... get a wii and get some excercise. I was breathing heavy after boxing and had a blast bowling. This is an experience you don't want to miss. It's simple and it works. You can also download the weather, news, internet websites, classic video games, and more! It's a fantasticly fun futuristic fantasy in a white box! It's awesome!", "The novelty wears off after a while with the wii remote. It has some great games, if only a handful. If you can get this a bargain price, get it. You will enjoy the classic nintendo games. Nintendo is the best in the busness at first party games. Sadly they are generally the worst at third party games. Crappy budget titles bleed from the library. It is a great system for family fun too. Wii bowling is one of the best games period. It's also a very reliable system too. Unlike the 360...In my opinion, if you want to get a new system, go with PS3 or Xbox 360.Mine collects dust. I turn it on once in a while to play bowling with my daughter or play mario galaxy, mario cart, last story, or rabidds go home. Those rabbits are a riot. Better yet, wait to get the wii u. wii is pretty much done at this point and the wii u is going to be able to play wii games.", "By now, you have probably heard all of the news stories about the sensational success of the Nintendo Wii.  It's sold out everywhere.  Grannies are playing Wii Sports in nursing homes because it's so easy to pick up and play.  But here's what you won't hear -- the Wii is a pitifully outdated piece of junk with one major gimmick (the motion control).  I'd like to see follow-up news stories about the grannies to see whether they still turn the thing on.  I know that mine now mostly collects dust, as do most other WiisThe defining features of the Wii is its motion control.  Here's the dirty little secret that the fanboys and enthusiastic recent buyers won't tell you: the Wii controls are terrible.  I have played through a lot of games, ranging from the AAA titles like Mario Galaxy and Zelda, to the party games like Mario Party 8 and Wii Sports and I can say this -- motion control is awful.  There is absolutely no precision to it.  If you had dreams of using the Wii-mote realistically like a lightsaber, than forget it. It doesn't facilitate any kind of decent control.  The only game where motion control actually improves the gameplay is Wii Bowling.  In every other game, it's generally an annoyance that is used in gimmicky fashion.  Random button pressing has been replaced with random Wii-mote gesturing.  By the time you have played a game like Zelda or Bully for a few hours, you will be wishing that you could push buttons in lieu of waving your Wii-mote around.  This is why 90% of the software on the Wii is shovelware party games.  This is why the Wii has the lowest ratio of software to hardware sales out of the three major consoles.Speaking of shovelware, the Wii has by far the worst library of any game console this decade.  Most of what comes out for it is unplayably bad.  There are a few great first party Nintendo titles (which are largely rehashes from prior Nintendo platforms), and a few great third party titles like Bully and Resident Evil 4 that are already available on other systems.  Every multiplatform game that comes out, whether its Madden football, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Guitar Hero, or a Call of Duty game, puts its worst version on the Wii.  If you don't believe me, then look up the reviews for these games.  The Wii always gets the worst version of every game.  I cannot think of one single exception to this rule.The reason for the poor Wii software library is that the Wii is nothing mroe than a Gamecube with gimmicky motion controls.  Everything about the technology, like graphics, level size, and loading times, are bad.  The Wii sees none of the recent advances that have improved video games, like realistic physics.  Not only does the Wii not get a good version of multiplatform games, it doesn't get the great games that take advantage of modern technology.  Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, Mass Effect, Far Cry 2, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead, Assassins Creed, Portal, Half-Life 2.  You cannot play these great games on the Wii.  Want to know why? Because they won't work on the Wii's 2001-esque technology.  You can't get downloadable content for Rock Band on the Wii.  Why? Because it lacks a hard drive.Two years ago, the price point for the Wii was a major selling point, but now that that PC hardware, the XBox 360, and the PS3 have dropped in price, this is no longer much of an advantage.  You can actually get a barebones XBox 360 for $50 less than a Wii now.The only people for whom I would recommend this console are:A:  People with children between the ages of 3 and 10B:  People who have lots of social gatherings at their house.The Wii is a good console for children because of the simplicity of the games, and the motion controls do add a certain element of fun when you are playing with other people.  I must say that the times where my in-laws have come over have seen the Wii get a lot of use.  Other than that, not much.  My wife plays the Lego games with me, but you can get that game on other platforms with better graphics.I bought a Wii about 8 months ago, and I'm thinking about selling it now.  I got some enjoyment out of it, but now I hardly ever turn it on.  The PC provides a much better gaming experience for me, and now I'm considering getting a PS3 or an XBox 360 instead.", "\"I've owned every Nintendo system since the NES. I've been playing video games for over 20 years. The Nintendo Wii is simply the best video game system of all time. The new motion sensor controller and \"\"nunchuck\"\" have reinvented the way games are played. The controller/nunchuck is very easy to pick up and use for the first time with wiisports. WiiSports is a great game. I would have easily paid 50 dollars for it. I love all of the sports but baseball and tennis are my favorites. Anyone can play these games. I own 3 other games but so far I spend most of my time playing wiiSports. The wii is very easy to set up and play. It took me less than 10 minutes to start playing and that included setting up the internet and installing the wii updates. The wii channel menus are easy to understand and use. The photo channel is fun. I'm looking forward to playing games on the wii from my favorite series like Mario and Resident evil. Nintendo has a huge winner on it's hands with the wii. I recommend it to everyone regardless of age or previous video game experience.\"", "I start of by saying this is a review for the console not prices and combination packages. Console - This is a great console it's lots of fun, especally in groups but also good by yourself. The graphics are not as good as a PS3 for example but they not ment be. To really enjoy this you got to get the right games like Mario Kart, Wii Sports Island, the Olympic games, any tennis game and Wii fit. If you want something for a great shoot 'um up get something else. This is great and is lots of fun for adults and children a like.Wii Sports - It's a great game in it's self Tennis and bowling is brilliant.

As an old school gamer who grew up playing Nintendo systems, the Wii was the first \"\"next gen\"\" console that I sought out and I have been very pleased with the gaming experience that it offers. It is not a system designed for the hardcore gamer, rather one that is meant to reach a wider demographic of people who may not have grown up playing games. Below is a summary of the good and bad aspects of the system and the games available; keep in mind that these are subjective to the gamer.Pros:1. Quality first-person titles and an improving library of third-person games. Many may dismiss the Wii on the basis of it being a \"\"kiddy\"\" or \"\"lifestyle\"\" system based on the lack of adult-oriented games, however few can argue that Nintendo really delivers with their franchises. \"\"Super Mario Galaxy\"\", \"\"Metroid Prime 3\"\", \"\"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\"\" and \"\"Mario Kart Wii\"\" are all fantastic games that really do the franchises justice. As the system has aged, more quality third-party titles have emerged such as \"\"Mad World\"\", \"\"House of the Dead: Overkill\"\", \"\"No More Heroes\"\", \"\"Okami\"\", and \"\"Klonoa\"\".2. Innovative controls. When properly utilized in a game, the unique motion controls of the Wii Remote are a blast and they do bring a new level of depth to the gameplay. Sports games, puzzles and platformers all benefit from this and it makes the game more involving; rather than having to remember what 8 buttons perform what functions, it's all about pressing a few buttons and waggling the remote.3. User-Friendly Interface. The Wii menu is perhaps the most streamlined and easy to use dashboard out of all the consoles. The Wii Shop is also easy to navigate in and out of, and shopping for games and add-ons is a snap.4. The Virtual Console. As was the case with the GBA and the DS, Nintendo is making a killing off of their old titles. The Virtual Console allows you to download classic games from the NES, SNES, Genesis, Neo Geo, and a host of other systems. The Classic Controller is require to play them, however this is a nice add on especially for older gamers who grew up in the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.5. Integrated wireless card. If you have wireless internet and your router is compatible with the Wii, this is your best bet for connecting the console to the internet.Cons:1. No Ethernet port. I am not sure how Nintendo screwed this up, however there is no Ethernet port in the back of the console; there are only 2 USB ports and you will need to purchase a LAN adapter separately. This is an annoyance if you don't use wireless internet.2. Inferior graphics. If you are a gamer that needs to have the best graphics, then you will be better off with the PS3 or the Xbox 360. The Wii has good graphics however it is technically inferior to the competition. Sadly, this means that some of the cross-platform titles will be inferior on the Wii, but then again graphics are not everything.3. Gimmicky games. Because of the unique controls, a lot of the games being produced for the Wii are gimmicky and focused more on the controls rather than story and gameplay. For me, this includes the \"\"Wii Fit\"\" and \"\"Wii Sports\"\". Both games were fun for the first few weeks, however I got bored once the novelty wore off and I have not played either game since. This has improved over the lifespan of the system, however this is still a lot of \"\"Shovelware\"\" being produced.4. Limited memory. The Wii only comes with 512 MB of internal memory, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the 120 GB and 160 GB hard drives being offered on the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. I guess this is because the Wii is not download-intensive, however the 512 MB gets eaten up quickly if you download a lot of Virtual Console and Wii Ware games. Fortunately, they system allows you to use an SD card to store and back-up downloaded content.The Pros and Cons of any video game system often depend on the gamer, so the above is just my own personal impressions after having owned my Wii for almost one year. Overall, I like the system a lot and I play it often despite a few shortcomings. I also own an Xbox 360 and that fulfills whatever needs that the Wii is not currently meeting, so I have no regrets about purchasing this console.\"", "\"I have long been a Nintendo fan but was, I confess, a bit turned off by the Gamecube.  The games were so limited, it seemed everything cool was coming out for either the PS2, the Xbox, or both (and not the Gamecube), and the proprietary titles (Mario Kart, Zelda, etc), great as they were, were not enough to keep me enthralled with the console.That having been said, my Wii has rekindled my interest in console gaming.  The unique techology of the controllers, the family-style games, and the virtual console were just appealing to me--so I took the plunge.  And already this thing is well worth the price (and it is the cheapest of this generation of consoles).Most of the great Wii games I've encountered so far are more appealing to either a multiplayer or a more casual audience.  I consider myself a hardcore gamer but do most of my gaming on the PC, so this console is perfect when I just want to relax and enjoy a nice, enjoyable game with my family.  My wife, my kids, my parents and friends--almost everyone I know enjoys playing the Wii.  I don't know that this would be my first choice if I were exclusively a console gamer, but as it is it serves my purposes very well.  And it's got many of the non-gamers I know hooked.One of the great features the Wii offers is the \"\"virtual console\"\"--the ability to download (for pretty cheap) many older games from Nintendo's earlier consoles, the Sega Genesis, and the TG 16.  This, to me, is a great feature.  While many of these games are not as enjoyable as they once were the nostalgia factor is incredible, and there's nothing quite like downloading the original Zelda for a pittance and spending a few hours messing around with it and just remembering \"\"the good ol' days.\"\"  And with new titles being released every week or so this is sure to continue to be a great feature of the Wii.In short: someone looking into this gaming console with the express desire to play very intense, \"\"hardcore\"\" games will probably be served better by the XBox 360.  But for anyone who wants an enjoyable gaming experience with high playability and loads of fun I highly recommend the Wii.  The innovative design and enjoyable games will provide countless hours of casual entertainment.\"", "There are far more party games for this system, and childish games. Its not the family system all the time because not everyone wants to play lack luster games. The good games come out every now and then but seldom are they considerate as far as looks. Some peripherals have their set backs, like the Wii Speak that does not allow you to use it at all if you don't have any Wii Friends. Waste of $$$ on that note. Wii Classic remote could really be used for great games like King of Fighters 12, and Street Fighter 4, if they actually considered making them for the system, but its seen as the mediocre party game system that seldom gets quality content, and thats mainly through Nintendo itself. We are waiting, but it sucks, if the Wii has more juice than the GameCube then there shouldn't be any excuse for last Gen titles with a $50 price tag slapped on them like they are worth it.", "\"Personal admission - I at least aspire to be some form of video game reviewer, and the Wii was the last console this generation that I've purchased by a long margin, largely because I suspected from the beginning that I would hate it forever.  Turns out I was right.  Most of my commentary following will at least aspire to neutrality, but just so the dedicated Nintendo fans can dismiss me now, I'm not among those who welcome any stupid idea from the company with open arms.I hate this thing.  I hate it with every fiber of my being.  When the next console comes out I will take this thing out to a big field and smash it to pieces with a whiffle ball bat.  I hate it for being the only repository for modern Nintendo console games and I hate that so many other people like it and I just don't understand what they're seeing.But what, you might ask yourself, is my deal?  Well, for one thing, I don't like the controls.  At all.  When I play a video game, I like being able to immerse myself in the game and not think about what I'm doing with my hands and body.  The Wii takes that away from me and puts me back in the same position I was when I was eight years old and trying to figure out what the different between A and B were on my NES.  This is an individual response, but as far as I'm concerned, waving my arms around like I'm hitting a baseball doesn't make me feel like I'm playing baseball - it makes it very obvious to me that I'm not interacting with my on-screen avatar in an easy or efficient way.The upside of this is that if you're a casual gamer or a newcomer to the field of computer games, you'll probably have an easier time warming up to the controls that I did.  The irony is delicious, really.  I certainly get what the charm would be for a person who doesn't play many games, but truly \"\"hardcore\"\" players who have spent years upon years learning how to work a DualShock might want to try the system out extensively before purchase.The second reason I hate the system has to do with the fact that it doesn't support HD, and this is something that everybody needs to think about.  The Wii can output a 480p widescreen signal, which is fine for a regular SD televisions, but you definitely need to check the performance for standard definition on an HD set before you invest.  Most low-end high definition sets don't come with Feroudja upscalers, and that can lead to some really, really awful looking SD, including whatever comes out of your Wii.  It's definitely a good idea to track down the proper settings for your particular set if this sort of thing is important to you.I am, of course, being quite harsh.  My mileage with the system has been and will continue to be terrible because of my reaction to the controls, but anybody not subject to my own strange prejudices will probably have a reasonable time.  While there's a shortage of monumentally great games (at least, as a percentage of total game output), there are plenty of wonderful titles that you can find for the system, and it's likely that your children will have a fun time with it.  The best thing you can do in this case is to do some research on your own television's performance and play with the thing in a store before you buy, just to be sure that you'll like it once you get it home.  For my part, I know that I'm not enjoying my purchase at all, but it's entirely likely that you might.\"", "Alot of fun.  Easy to learn controls.  Less intimidating than other consoles due to the unimposing look of the controller.  Yeah sounds like a press release from Nintendo but all turn out to be true.  My wife hates video games but loved Wii sports.  Just pick up and play.  No complicated tutorials.  No shapes on the controller to represent certain actions.  No weird combos.  Just swing a bat/racket/club, and your character does that action.  Simple.  Boxing rules by the way.  Fun in the Mike Tysons Punchout kinda way.  Alot of fun.  The Wii is also a little graphics powerhouse.  Call of Duty 3, Zelda, Need for Speed Carbon, all blew me away with how nice the graphics were.  The Wii is for real.  It's a blast.", "The Wii could be, and should be, great. But it's not. I'm a dad with a 10 year old son. The best game we've played is Wii Sports which comes with the console. That's pretty sad. The controllers should lead to some creative games, but most of the games have been pretty awful. Mario Olympics is pretty good. Lego Batman was pretty good- and used the controls well. Tiger Woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls. Many other games are really poorly done, like all of the Carnival Games, Mini-Golf, etc. Wii Sports is fun for get togethers, and creating Wii characters is pretty fun. Other than that, just about any other gaming system is 99% better. I'm sticking with PC gaming myself.", "my brother owns this and i love playing it with him. there are a few drawbacks, but overall the system is great and unique. i own a ps3 and 360 and this is the most fun of the 3.PROS:-inexpensive-unique controller- great for all ages-fun lineup of games-small, will fit anywhere, even in tight areas-hard to overheat. can be on for days with no problems-gets the family involved-photo, online features and news and weather features are cool.-reliable (unlike the 360)CONS:-terrible graphics compared to the ps3. they are good though since it costs only 250-weak processor. it needs a power upgrade.-cant play dvd movies-doesnt support 1080 high definition-ugly color. black would have been nice. when it gets dirty, the marks are easily visable.", "I've had my Wii for about four years now. It was 250 when I bought it. It seemed a little steep at the time, but fortunately the price has fallen considerably. With that in mind, I'd recommend the Wii to anyone and everyone. It's good fun for the price.As most surely know by now, the Wii makes use of motion controls. I won't beat around the bush: Waggling your remote around can be both tedious and annoying on some games. But fortunately, there are enough games that use normal control schemes. The Wii Remote is often flipped horizontally and implemented as if it was a NES controller. Also, they make a Classic Controller attachment for the Wii Remote (sold separately). With that add-on, you can play quite a few Wii games with SNES-styled dual analog controller.There aren't many graphical masterpieces on the Wii. People often say that its graphics aren't very different from those present on the N64, but this isn't exactly true. The Wii's image quality really is a lot sharper than most of the games present on that system. But since we can make some comparisons with a system released almost seventeen years ago, the Wii obviously can't compete with graphically with its HD competition.The Wii has some online functionality. It doesn't have a social network implemented in the same way the Xbox 360 and the PS3 do, but it does have a Wii Friend code system for playing with people you know. Many games implement online multiplayers. You can also download and purchase video games from Nintendo through the Wii Shop Channel. In additional to all that, you can even browse the web from your console. But unfortunately, the web browser is pretty terrible in terms of functionality.That's pretty much all I can say about the Wii, except this one additional thing: You can get a Wii through Amazon for as little as 70 bucks now. If you don't have a game console and are looking for a good form of entertainment, why not pick up a Wii? Most of the second and third party games are really cheap now too. The Wii is probably worth 150 bucks new, and its a downright steal for the price you can get it at used.", "\"The \"\"Wii\"\" is by far the best video game system we have ever owned and is much enjoyed by our son (12), daughter (16), my wife (48) and me (44).  The controls were easy for all of us to master (using the included Wii Sports game to learn).We have had the Wii for about 7 months and have about 12 or so games for the system, not including all of the GameCube games that it plays as well (which was important of us since we had about 30).The ability to connect over our Internet connection and play games with on-line players is a big plus and works very well (we recommendMario Kart Wii with Wii Wheelfor this, very fun). The on-line polls and contests are also fun.Highly recommended!\"", "Bought this for grand kids they love it.  Games are much cheaper then their old xbox.  What can I say its a wi.", "\"The Wii is a truly amazing system! The controller is very responsive and the whole thing is easy to use and to hook up.So why not perfect? Well...Here is \"\"My Wii Adventure\"\".I put a reso down on a Wii at GameCrazy back a month or so ago, so I knew I was going to get one. I don't have high speed internet at home, so I went out and got a cable modem.Well, I get the thing home yesterday, spend entirely too long getting my modem hooked up (that's another story, but not a fun one), and was finally ready go to online with my Wii!That's when I learned that it's wireless only.And the LAN adapter won't be out until next year.Nooooooooooooooo!But I rallied. My ISP doesn't provide wireless access, but eventually I get either get a Wii adapter or buy a wireless thingy for my cable modem, so that's good.However!The Wii had one last nasty surprise!I went to my local Wal-Mart and bought a Classic Controller, having been told by many that it could be used to control GameCube games, and I wanted me a GameCube game! I then went and traded in a stack of DVDs at my local GameStop (I'm not very loyal to my retailers), and............ found out the Classic Controller can't be used to play GameCube games on the Wii... *sigh*So I instead bought a used GameCube controller and I'll have to deal with that. I returned the Classic Controller to Wal-Mart.Despite those minor errors, and they are REALLY minor, the system is really excellent and I highly recommend it! :D\"", "\"I'm sure a lot of people love Wii because of it's \"\"revolutionary\"\" motion sensing controller gaming experience.  So I am not going to mention how fun it is.Instead, I would like to point out the pros and cons of Wii at the current 2.0U firmware. Things may change for future firmware updates.The reason I give 3 Stars is because I average two major categories: Innovation and Technology.  I give Innovation for 5 stars, and technological achievement and convenience for 2 stars.Motion Sensing technology is nothing new, it has been applied to cell phone gaming and vehicle air bags for quite a while.  The system is barely an upgrade from the Gamecube.  It is extremely inconvenient to share game save data compare to PS3 and even Gamecube.  The innovation point is how Nintendo has achieved to redesign the motion sensors for even better game play experience.Pros:- Parental Control- Able to count amount of time user has spent to play different Wii channels. Best for parents tracking kids video game time.- Motion Sensing Controller is extremely similar as Playstatoin 3's Six-Axis Controller.  This brings brand new intuitive gaming experience.- Bluetooth wireless technology in Wii Remote prevents cord wind up hazzles and less wireless signal interference.- AC Adaptor is separated from the console. This makes it the smallest Next Generation Console on the Market at this moment.- Backward Compatibility to Gamecube and Virtual Consoles.- White color in a very clean design.- Built in WiFi for internet downloads.- New Internet Browser is available for download in April 2007- Cheapest amaong XBOX360 and PS3- Suitable for all ages as long as you can hold the remote and know how to swing it.- My 90 Year Old Grandpa was able to get a strike in bowling, hole in one in Golf, some tennis racket swing and boxing punches.Cons:- Games are not Region Free. Unlike Playstation3 and PSP, that are region free, user cannot play import games at all without modifying their Wii's hardware.  American gamers are going to miss out a lot of interesting Japanese games such as Gundam, Naruto, Super Robot War, and many many others, even those games that don't really require people to understand Japanese!- Unable to count the amount of time the user playing Gamecube games.- Cannot easily exchange the game save data from one Wii to another. Let me elaborate this problem.If you want to share your Zelda progress to another friend, you cannot simply store your game save in the SD card and bring to your friend's house to load in his Wii console.  Instead, you have to do the following1. overwrite his save file. Make sure you tell your friend to backup his own save data. Or,2. if he hasn't played the game yet, you have to create a save file by playing the game and save at the first save point.  After that, you have to overwrite the the save on the console with the one in the SD card.- You must need a gamecube memory card and controller to play Gamecube games.  You cannot backup or save any data on the Wii console's internal 512MB memory nor SD card.  If you want to know how ripoff Nintendo is on Gamecube memory cards, please read my other reviews on \"\"Gamecube memory card 1019 and 59 Blocks\"\".- The system resets itself even from minor configuration.- Cannot use the Wii Remote to call up the system menu when playing Gamecube.  Therefore, you cannot even turn off the system with the remote.- Lacking DVD movie support even Wii game disc has the memory and physical size of a DVD.- The system gets warm during standby mode. Not sure the power consumption during Standby mode.  Anybody can clearify this?- It does not have an option for automatic firmware update in standby mode.- Somtetimes takes nearly 30 minutes or more to receive messages or Mii from other players.- Virtual Console Account is depended on the system's serial number instead of an online account.  That means if you have purchased any games/software from Wii Shop and suddenly your Wii is malfunctioning, either for an exchange or brand new replacement, you CANNOT redownload the contents for free in any replacement system.  You might need to contact Nintendo regarding to giving you back the Wii Points for in-store exchange/manufacture warrenty to redownload the content to the replacement system.- It creates a noise from the disc reader trying to read the disc even the slot is empty everytime the user resets or turn on the sytem.- Currently, most games are party games, it is fun when you have a buch of friends sitting side by side to each other.  There is currently no online games available.- The GPU and CPU is a lot inferior compare to XBOX360 and PS3; therefore, the graphics and controls are really bad especially for any kind of First Person Shooters. We'll see how well Metroid Prime perform in Wii soon.\"", "As always, nintendo may not be doing the whole package such as HD dvd or Blue ray, or monster HD graphics, but The 480P, wireless network, unique controlers, and low price tag make this unit a very formitable competition for the X box 360 and PS3.  One thing nintendo has never left out is the whole family.  This unit may not have all of the violent and top selling games at the other two units, but it has plenty of games that are fun, and allowable for 5-8 year olds to play with.  This is worth checking out.  I'm sure you will not be dissappointed.", "The Nintendo Wii is a fantastic game system for kids especially but I think most adults will love it just as much. The Wii doesn't have nearly as good of graphics as the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 but the game selection is so much better for young kids. Many of the games on these other systems have a lot of foul language and so far I am not seeing that at all with Wii games. In addition there is a huge selection of games that kids will love. Most of the games fully utilize the motion sensing technology inside the Wii remote and will get your kids up and moving. Some of the games are even quite exhausting and I consider very good exercise. My Daughter loves playing Wii Cheer 2 which she plays almost daily. It teaches you cheer routines and you get to unlock new characters, songs and challenges. Wii Sports is fun for the whole family with a variety of sports to play. It is fun to get a group of people playing together and have competitions. The new Super Mario Bros is also very cool; it's a new and improved version of the original Super Mario Bros with great game play and improved graphics. If you enjoyed playing the original on the Nintendo Entertainment System then you have got to try this new version. I could go on and on about how many good games there are but I will leave it at that. This is certainly the best game system for the younger crowd.", "The system is fun, yes, but its looked down at with true gamers. Zelda is the only game keeping it afloat,and its good. But in terms of whats coming, not alot. For the price, its worth it, but the games, wait and see.As for the straps, stop blaming Nintendo for your own problems. Its not the straps, its the gamers that play like a flailing retard.", "The Wii came out, with a refreshing new design and innovative idea: incorporating motion into gaming. Still, after 5+ years, the Wii  still stands as a friendly-to-all type of a console. Family, friends, everyone can enjoy playing Wii games together. In the past, and still presently, the emphasis was on the individual gamer and the online experience. The Wii has many games that bond family and friends together, as well as provide an online experience.What you should know:- Many games on the Wii (at least produced after the Wii's release), are motion based. However, be wary that some games are not fully motion based. Generally, the motion detection is good, with some awkward hiccups here and there.- You can play older Gamecube games on the Wii. I love this feature! I've found myself browsing in my local Gamestop for games I've already wanted to try, but didn't get a chance to. You can also connect the gamecube controller to the Wii, as well as use the Wii's new gamepad or other companies' Wii-compatiable gamepads.- The graphics are bad. I can't put it any differently. I can tell you that it's okay that the graphics are nowhere near modern day technology/standard, but it's not. It's one of the only flaws of this machine. You'd think that by 2006, Nintendo would know how to incorporate better graphics and fun gaming experience together. However, I'd give Nintendo a break because they spent A LOT of money on research for bringing motion gaming to the general public.- The internet browsing, picture viewer, among other Wii menu apps, are very nice. I enjoy watching videos on the Wii browser.My experience:- I love playing games on the Wii that are of multiplayer nature. Everyone has such a blast. The bad graphics actually make the experience enjoyable, funny, hilarious, light-hearted, ironically. There are games that are Nintendo exclusive likeSuper Smash Bros. BrawlandNew Super Mario Bros. Wii. Mario Kart is also a blast. It's unlike any other gaming experience. These games are instant classics, although it's only been just a few years.- Get your butts off the couch! Gone are just sitting down and exercising your eyes, thumbs, and fingers. You can now get up and do simple but addictive sport games likeWii Sports, exercise withWii Fit Plus - Software Onlyand even dance withZumba Fitness. XBOX and PS3 just started catching on, but the Wii remains the most ahead of the curve right now.- I like the interface of the menu, the little intricacies like the sounds, loading icon, etc. etc. Everything feels so happy, delightful, and soft. It's hard to put in words, but the Wii feels friendly to interact with.Bottom Line:- The Wii is the first to introduce the motion style of gaming, and still is the best at doing so. With updates of theWii Remote Plus - Blackand the addition of theWii Fit with Balance Boardshows that the Wii is willing to make updates to continue to improve the gaming experience.- There are much more of a variety of games since the introduction of the Wii. You'll see shooting games, Movie-themed games, sports games, children's games, etc. etc.- 2-4 Multiplayer at its best. Whichever games you decide to play with your friends and loves ones, you'll be sure to have an enjoyable time.", "I have a general question about the Wii that hopefully someone can answer.  I understand you can play NES and SNES games on the Wii that are being released each week.  Now, let's say you purchase a game like Zelda for the NES or SNES.  Will the Wii save your progress on these games, or is it just a play when you want then shut it off and have to start over every time type thing?  I know the Wii will save it's own games, but does it also save older games??  Thanks for any info anyone can give.P.S. I had no idea you could download older games, that alone makes this system blow Xbox and PS3 out of the water!", "The wii is a Christmas gift for my kids. I started looking before thanksgiving knowing how difficult it can be to find them. No luck around town, so I ordered it from Amazon. Received it in two days. Perfect condition.The wii is perfect for my family. My six year old can play all of the included sports games -- and can win against older kids and adults so it keeps her engaged. Plus we have a couple of new singing games (Disney Sing It and HS Musical) that are ideal too.My ten year old loves the sports games, but also enjoys the Star Wars and Bash games. The resolution and gaming is not an issue -- the Star Wars games look great and play great.Its perfect for the family -- everyone can play and have fun. I highly recommend a wii."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08209105581045151, 0.06587886065244675, 0.04543016478419304, 0.10830068588256836, 0.0009079170413315296, 0.058342818170785904, 0.001252033980563283, 0.004932536277920008, 0.0008764143567532301, 0.062267668545246124, 0.03214486688375473, 0.013926138170063496, 0.05321004241704941, 0.0012727758148685098, 0.0007620950927957892, 0.017819756641983986, 0.004319075495004654, 0.01741410419344902, 0.08720652014017105, 0.01868388056755066, 0.02346472628414631, 0.041219692677259445, 0.05875058472156525, 0.043534599244594574, 0.0027233967557549477, 0.031623173505067825, 0.030759263783693314, 0.0007501510553993285, 0.04374413192272186, 0.0013205240247771144, 0.011746863834559917, 0.033323511481285095]]}
