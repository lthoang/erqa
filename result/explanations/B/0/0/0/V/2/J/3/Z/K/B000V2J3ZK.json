"], "reviews": ["\"This product is an enhancement to the rub and scrub method.  It is a nice little perk, but remember,  that once the pad supply is gone, you need to purchase more!!  The Neutrogena Wave cleaner is relatively inexpensive, but you will pay in the long run for the refills.The cleaner is not to be used around the eye area, so what that means to me is that I need to get another cleaning pad or a washcloth to do that area.  So I am back to doing two steps again.  There isn't a lot of soap sud in the pad, but it is easily changeable.With a vibrating cleaner, going up and down, round and round, I get the feeling like I am shaving!  Although the cleaner is \"\"pretty in pink\"\", it makes it easy to locate when you need it.For the long run, skip it.  Like I said,  I don't like using it, then switching to a manual effort and cleaner for the eye area.....Rizzo\"", "Nuetrogena is known for it's soaps and now they've added a device that will also do the scrubbing for you. The wave power cleanser fits neatly in your hand and when you turn it on it gently cleans your face. The pre-soaped cleaning pads are very nice and leave your face clean but not too dry. You can also use it when you're under the shower to save time.This is a good product which is why it gets 5 stars. However, I also like my Olay Daily Facials Self-Foaming Discs, Combination/Oily, 30-disc Tubs, (Pack of 3) which I have been using before the  Wave cleanser. Usually when I am tired at night I just want to gently clean my face of all makeup and don't want to switch on another gadget however gentle. The Olay discs also leave my face clean and moisturized and I like their supple cloth like feel. Most importantly, I use them to remove eye makeup and I don't feel comfortable using the Wave Cleanser around the delicate eye area.I am already using theNeutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kitwhich has a similar powered gadget. It's great for scrubbing your face and making your skin glow. I have found myself using the Wave cleanser more in the shower than at the sink.", "I'm glad I order this product.  I felt an immediate benefit in how my skin felt.  It did feel smoother as promised in product description. I had a red mark on  my face from a pimple and it reduced the color.  I don't recommend using this on an active pimple, but it can reduce the look of acne scars.  I was suprised that it does indeed remove makeup.  I tested it with makeupremover and no makeup showed up after using the WAVE. I will buy more in the future.", "This product is OK.  It is nice that it comes with the AA battery needed.  Cleansing pads are also included.  I suppose this is nice for traveling as it is compact.  I don't think this is a good product for everyday use, however.  It really does not have much power.  It claims it will leave skin soft but I did not find any difference.  I can't recommend this one.", "\"The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser provided a reasonable clean in a compact, battery powered package.The ProsThe package is small and portable.  I enjoyed the fact that I was able to pack it for travel without it taking up a ton of space.  The replaceable pads are also small and water activated.  The vibration is mild and provides a comfortable, gentle cleansing for the face.The ConsThe lather produced was not sufficient for me.  I like more lather for a deep cleanse, or the \"\"power\"\" cleanse promised by the name of the product.  I didn't feel that this product provided a better cleansing than I would get from an old fashioned sponge and bar of Neutrogena cleaner. Therefore, this is not likely a product that will become a staple for me.\"", "I wasn't expecting much from this little product from Neutrogena, but was pleasantly surprised to find it works as promised. It really digs deep into pores and unclogs the dirt and residue from makeup, medicine, or whatever your skin requires. And even though you have to hold the battery operated device under the water, the batteries did not get wet and continued working.", "I am 30+ women who has mixed skin and when I used it I loved that it made my face feel smooth and that product had a nice smell. I like the shape and size of the product. The problem was after 2 days of use I broke-out.My 9 year son used it and loved the product. It cleared up a few of his  problem areas and got him to wash his face (which as a Mom is great).So my only suggest who be to have soap option for sensitive skin and if the product was not pink it would be great for all sexes. The Battery was also difficult to get into - not user friendly.", "After using theNeutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kitand being so completely won over with the results it produced, I had to try this product.I have sensitive skin and with most ordinary cleansers, even ones that claim to be gentle or hypoallergenic, I end up looking like a wind burned mess.  This product is very simple to use and the vibration is very unobtrusive, it doesn't feel uncomfortable at all.  The cleanser is very gentle and the pad is very soft, it feels very nice against your skin.  I was truly impressed with the way my face looked, but more than that I was impressed with how soft my face felt after just one use. I kept having my husband feel my face; I couldn't believe how soft it was.I used it on my husband as well and he remarked how clean his face felt.  He'll use whatever's handy on his face, and it makes me cringe, but I think I have finally converted him to some normal skin care with this product.  He is as impressed, as I am.I don't use it everyday, I use it every other day, rotating between this and my medicated face wash I have to use.  Between this product and theNeutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit, my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.This is a product I will continue to use, I think it is definitely worth the price.  I'm a fan!", "The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is a wonderful product. Lightweight, doesn't take up much space, and cleans my face beautifully. I have very sensitive skin, so was wary the first time I used it. Afterward, my skin felt so soft, and I love the way the cleanser feels as it travels over my face, gently cleansing. No redness or irritation, which is a must for me. I recommend this product.", "This is very gentle on your face, the pads are soft and are loaded with the cleanser. It works well to cleanse your face and you get a gentle massage with it. The harder you press the harder the vibration is. It is easy to hold and use.It does NOT exfoliate though, you would need to use something else to get an exfoliating effect.", "The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is designed to clean the grime from your face... and that it does!  The vibration sent from the device is not rough and the pads feel good on the skin.  I wasn't sure if there was a particular direction that the pads should be placed which caused me to alternate sides until it created suds.  Once I got it started it felt nice until the solutions started making my face burn.  I really don't have sensitive skin so I don't understand why it felt that way.  All in all, I would use it sparingly because it left my skin feeling extra clean and wasn't drying at all.", "The first thing I noticed about this item is that the cleanser doesn't suds up at all like what's shown on the commercials.  The vibration feels good on the face, but I'm not sure that my face feels any cleaner from using it.", "As one who adores beauty products, I am happy to have this one on the shelf. The exfoliant qualities left my skin feeling smooth and invigorated, and, though it does not precisely remove the blackheads which I still have (past middle age), it does make the skin 'breathe' and removes harsh or dry skin. It is a wonderful addition to a facial regimen.", "I got this for my wife who writes:For those in a hurry: this is a great product, buy it!For others: After receiving this, I quickly found the instructions were easy, simple and straightforward.  I was soon using it although the one small impediment of the battery cover being hard to remove wasn't that bad.It's water-resistant so I was able to use it in the shower.  It did a thorough job without being harsh and the soap included in the pad was minty and fresh.I followed the cleansing with my normal moisturizer and now, the morning after, my skin is still fresh and most importantly, not dried out.  There is nothing about this cleanser that I do not like.  Five, well-deserved stars.", "This Power-Cleanser apparatus does an excellent job of cleansing skin.  However, where many of us need it the most (around nose) it doesn't easily go.  I found myself manually washing that area as well as around eyes.  Thus, rather than a time saver using it doubled the process.For me, it's a big plus that it can be used in the shower.  Once again there is the question of the cost of additional pads.  I found them online at 30 for $15.  In all probability, I'll stick with my regular exfoliating cleanser.- Gail Cooke", "I recieved this though the Vine.This came with one double -A- battery, and two packs of small round cotton pads with neutrogena soap in them. The pads adhere to the top.I didn't care for the soap in the pads .This is water proof. I kept it in the shower.If your a Neurtogena soap user, you might like this face soap!It came with a $3.00 off coupon to buy more little pads with Neutrogena face soap in the pads.I think they want you to buy Allot more pads!My face feels a bit smoother after using this.All this does is have a viberating motion!The viberating of the wave power can be a bit strange at first, but after awhile you get use to it.I would like this better if there was some differnt type of brushes on this that moved around to be more of an exfoliant.I gave this to my Granddaughter, she thinks its just ok!", "\"We'd seen this advertised on TV & wanted to check it out.  I didn't quite know what to expect as we've both got pretty sensitive skin.  Both my wife & myself were delightfully surprised how smooth & refreshed our faces felt after using the \"\"WPC\"\".  Even after only the 1st use just as they've been advertising.  It's kinda funny because we've been fighting over usage as my wife says \"\"it's girly & I don't need to use it\"\".  Is it really so wrong to wanna have smooth skin too? :P LOL  The only thing is that it does take once or twice of going over your face before the suds really start to lather up, though using a little more pressure seems to help lather it up a little faster.  Living in Alaska, the long dry winters can really take a toll on our skin.  The \"\"WPC\"\" truely is a blessing.  I'd recommend everyone picking one of these up, we're sure impressed with it & glad we did.\"", "I really enjoyed this product.  I found the vibration invigirating, especially in the morning when taking a shower.  It left my skin soft.  Great to get rid of the winter dryness.  I would highly recommend this prodcut.  It came with a coupon for replacement pads.  Great item.", "Good skin is something I am always conscious of.  I can't even begin to count the number of cleansers, moisturizers, and gadgets I've tried on my face.  When Amazon.com offered the Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser for review to their Vine members, I knew I was interested in trying it, especially after enjoying theNeutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kitso much.Neutrogena's Wave Power Cleanser worked fine.  It cleansed well, it had no issues being submerged underneath the shower spray (I prefer to wash my face in the shower, and the documentation assured it was submersible), and I suffered no ill-effects from its use.That said, I also didn't notice any significant improvement in my skin after adopting this new daily regimen.  It didn't seem to make any more difference than the Aveda Purifying Cr&egrave;me Cleanser I've been using for years with a simple washcloth.Perhaps it is my regular use of theNeutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kitthat caused me to see no difference in my skin.  After a week's use I began to wonder if the Wave Power Cleanser simply could not improve on what that other device is already doing for my skin using it three times a week.Regardless, I see no need to continue to use the Wave Power Cleanser.  Yes, it worked fine.  Yes, it was easy to use.  But it is still a little more trouble than your normal facial cleanser and a washcloth.If you are looking to add a step to your facial cleansing routine that performs more in-depth exfoliation and skin cleansing, I would recommend the Ne Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator rather than the Neutrogena's Wave Power Cleanser.  Why, you ask?  Simple.  The Rejuvenator is recommended for use three times a week rather than daily use.  Simple math says that requires fewer purchases of the special cleansing pads both devices require, reducing your long-term cost of use.  Also, it is less cumbersome to use the simple washcloth cleansing method in your daily routine and add the more thorough cleansing/exfoliation only three days of the week.The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is not a bad device, I simply think for what it does, a washcloth and your favorite cleanser does just as well in most cases, and Neutrogena has a much better option for thorough cleansing and exfoliation in the Rejuvenator.", "I really like the little scrubber that you use to clean your face, but I don't like the scent of the pads (I have allergies) and anything I use on my face usually has some kind of scent to it. I did feel like my face was extra clean without being dried out or roughed up, which actually surprised me.I would have given this product an extra star if it came with unscented pads, but maybe they will introduce them in the near future.I gave the rest of the pads to my 16 year old step-daughter and will update this review with her feedback when she has some for me.", "You would think and electronic makeup remover and the brand name of Neutogena would be a top notch product. Well, this Wave Power Cleanser hardly does the job. The cleansing pads that come with this power tool are useless and overall there is not enough power to get the job done.I recommend you use the old fashion way of cleaning your face- with a bottle soap and a wash cloth. The product is not worth the price or the time.Katiebabs", "I really like the design. This is small, you can hold it well when cleaning. It came with a battery, which is a plus. I am somewhat disappointed with the lather however. The pads don't foam up very well unless you manipulate them with your fingers first. I have small pores and normal to dry skin. It was an ok moisturizer. Another use you may not think of?  I used it on my elbows and really, really liked it for them!", "I'm kind of a splash some water, maybe a little soap and call it a wash kind of gal, but I tried Neutrogena's Wave Power Cleanser (pink) and really like it.  It takes one AA battery, which was conveniently included.  It is a small gismo that fits easily in my hand.  It says to attach a disposable pad, hold under water to activate the foaming pad, then to gently massage over face.  I was going to say that it felt like a face massage, but it felt better than a face massage, because it left my face feeling clean. It has menthol so it feels minty refreshing. It tickled when I used it on my nose. Before I tried it I wondered if it would feel like a car wash, but the brush vibrates rather than spins. My face feels relaxed and much cleaner than when I just splash on a little water.", "\"In essence, the Wave is a pore cleaner that works by gently vibrating your skin to shake loose the contents of your pores. This is NOT meant to be an exfoliator or toner. It does its job exceedingly well, which surprised me. I have tested many, many skin care products over the years, and was quite cynical about this one working. Really, it does.First, the theory. Your face is full of pores - i.e. holes that go downward into your skin. Dirt, sweat, make-up and other junk gets stuck in those holes. That is what forms blemishes. The more dirt and such you have in your pores, the more they are \"\"pushed open\"\" and the bigger they look. Keeping them as clean as possible also makes them as small as possible, so your skin has a smoother overall look.This small handheld device lets you attach a pad to the face of it, then you moisten that pad to get the soap going. It isn't a \"\"big foaming\"\" soap, it's a very subtle one. Again, the aim is not to cover your face with foam. It's for the vibrations to get the small amount of gentle foam down into your pores. Pores are small :) You hold that vibration on one spot, to vibrate open the pores beneath the device. You don't want to \"\"drag\"\" the wave, like you would with an exfoliant. The aim is not to drag the pores open. It is to shake them up gently to loosen their contents, so that the washing stage gets those contents out of your skin. So you put the wave onto various parts of your skin, in order to do that. Then you rinse the junk all free. If anything your aim is to open the pores as little as possible, so that once the junk is shaken out of them, they can close up to a small size.So that this process doesn't take all day, the wave face is relatively large - about the size of a half dollar. This is good in the sense that you can do your entire face in under 10 minutes, but bad in the sense that it doesn't fit well in those big-pore areas along the nose. I understand this was a tough compromise for them to make. If they'd made the unit smaller, people would complain about how long it took them to get their entire face done.I like how easily the pads go on and off the sticky face, but it seems really odd to me the pads come in a non resealable foil pouch. There's no way at all to even \"\"fold over the top\"\" to keep them moist! That's a pretty simple fix for them to have made. That being said, there's really no way I'm going to go out and eternally buy pads for a device. I would just use cotton balls with my own Neutrogena acne soap (which I use daily and *love*). This would get me my favorite soap option along with the pore-cleansing capabilities of this device.I really do find that this shakes loose dirt that normal cleaning cannot get to. My pores look much cleaner and smaller after using this device. I have no doubt that using this is gentle on your skin - I have rosacea and acne and my face will definitely flare if something bothers it. I haven't had any problems with this. I wonder though if most people will have the patience to use this properly. It's not a quick-use device. The whole way it works is to work section by section, shaking loose the dirt, cleaning out the pores in that one spot. I think most people want to do a quick pass with soap or exfoliant or whatever and get on with their life.It's one of those investment things. If you invest the time to keep your skin clear and healthy, it will reward you by looking wonderful and doing its job of keeping you safe from germs. If you want a quick-fix to just soap off the outer layer of grime - or exfoliate off the outer layer of skin - you won't get the same results. So I highly recommend this as something which does take time to use, but you might be surprised at just how much better your pores are if you do invest that time and effort.My only complaints are about the pads, and like I said, there's a solution for that.\"", "my 14 year old daughter had high hopes for this product as it is endorsed by a popular actress these days. it felt as it the included cleanser pads would be gentle enough but it irritated her skin nonetheless. she also didn't like the smell of the cleanser. she didn't want to use it at all and wanted me to just send it back. it's not that it didn't work, it did. she just didn't like it.", "I usually don't use beauty products, but I do love using this one!  My face feels noticably softer after use, and I've even started using it on other parts of my body to make them softer (i.e., my hands).  Wonderful little product!", "\"The product works as advertised.  On my large-pore mixed-skin-type face, it seemed to quickly leave my skin feeling softer and smoother.  The cleanser didn't seem to clean the pores out as thoroughly as a charcoal mask, and I think that the soft foaming pad would \"\"absorb\"\" less from your skin than a clay mask would.  But it's quick and easy to use.As with all such products, you should avoid using it around the eyes where the skin is delicate, and should moisturize after use.The water-tight battery compartment is a little hard to get into and the grip isn't exactly ergonomic, but that wasn't a problem for the short time it takes for a single cleansing.The time savings are minimal since you still need water and a place to rinse your face afterwards.  But there is less cleanup, and no stray bits of mask left behind after washing.For somebody on the go, this could be a convenient tool and not as messy as a traditional clay or charcoal mask.  But for many, this will just be another gadget gathering dust in the bathroom closet.  I didn't find it exciting or compelling, but had no complaints either.This item works as advertised, but since it does not work as well as a mask and  with the lack of a compelling reason to buy this product, I mark it down to 4/5 stars.\"", "Pros:The Neutrogena wave power cleaner does fit nicely in your hand.You can use it in the shower and it does get very sudsy.The disposable pads are a nice touch. I use Neutrogena cleanser anyway, so it's a convenient format.My face did feel soft after use.Cons:I almost broke a nail getting the battery cover off. It is VERY un-user-friendly.All it does really is vibrate mildly. You still have to move your hand around to distribute the cleanser.The pads go on the cleaning head well enough, but I can imagine enough use would render the velcro-like head fuzzy enough to be unusable.All in all, I think better products are out there for a full facial experience. Personally, I think I will stick to Bufpuf pads or a washcloth.", "I am usually a fan of products by Neutrogena, so I took a chance on this particular item which is something that I wouldn't have necessarily considered otherwise.  When it comes to skin care, I am a very low-maintenance person. Soap and water and acne medicine. However, I have, on occasion been known to pay for professional facials as a luxury item and fully appreciated the change in my skin texture.  I even got my husband hooked on them.  As the mother of 2 children under the age of 3, I have precious little time to spend on indulgences such as advanced skin care.  This product really surprised me.  I expected to use it a few times and stick it back in the closet to collect dust.  After one time, I am hooked. The first time out of the box the instructions were simply enough that I had it assembled and working in under 3 minutes.  When I started to use it, I thought it was almost too easy and expected to be disappointed with the results. I was not.  My skin tends to be on the dry side and does not naturally exfoliate well. There is a visible and tangible difference in the texture of my face after a single use. My skin literally felt baby-soft, which I love.  The full treatment itself took only 5 minutes, which I also love.  I cannot say that I would do this daily, but a couple of times a week wouldn't be hard to squeeze in even for stay-at-home moms who need a little pampering.  While I didn't see a tremendous difference in pore clarity with the first use, it does improve with subsequent uses.  Mostly, I was very impressed with the ease of use, speed of process and overall change in skin texture with one 5-minute application.  If you have considered expensive skin treatments, this gives the kind of softness over several uses that you would get from a pro-facial at a fraction of the time and cost. I recommend it very highly and even moreso as someone who has very sensitive skin.", "This product comes is a hand-held vibrating cleanser and comes with two packs of pre-soaped pads and AA battery. It is easy to use and provides a soothing and deep cleansing. The motion in the cleanser is soothing and not abrasive and can be used everyday. It is usable in the shower as well. Easy to use, great product, now only if Amazon would get it back in stock.", "Overall Thoughts:I was pleased with the pink color of the handheld cleaner, however, size wise, it was a bit too short, and hard to grip/hold onto.  Batteries were included in the box, so that was helpful.  Further, there was a large supply of 14 cleansing pads to use, which would last me several weeks at least.  The cleansing pads were easy to apply and stick onto the device, and the pads had a clean, and refreshing smell.Operation:I wasn't very pleased with the operation of the cleanser.  It wasn't very effective in removing all the makeup, and further, it didn't feel particularly soothing during use.  In fact, it felt jarring.  It made no discernible differences in skin appearance, however, at least no residue was left on the face.Final Thoughts:The wave cleanser might be more convenient to bring along than say makeup remover + cotton balls on a business trip, but the wave cleanser was big and chunky and took up room in the suitcase.  I definitely wouldn't buy this product.  It seemed to do a worse job than cotton balls + makeup remover, which are vastly cheaper, and no less convenient.  I guess if you must have an electronic gadget to remove your makeup, you could get this.", "\"The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is a petite, battery-powered facial cleanser that can go into the shower with you (a real plus) and provides a light vibration and foaming action for your skin.My experience with \"\"the Wave\"\" was quite variable.  I absolutely love the shape and size (tiny enough to be comfortable and easy to use even for my very small hands) and the color (hot pink).  I dislike the fact that the pad must be discarded after a single use and that the extra pads provided in the starter kit do not come in a resealable pouch.  I keep my Wave in the shower--so where exactly do I keep an opened, unsealed bag of foaming cleanser heads where they won't get wet and yet will be convenient to take one off the wave and put on a fresh one every time I shower?  So far, I haven't found a good answer.All in all, it is a cute little product, but I can get equally good (and perhaps better) results using my Buf-Puf Gentle Facial Sponge - 1 ea, 2 Packs and a little soap.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030471736565232277, 0.017715100198984146, 0.030825885012745857, 0.036487139761447906, 0.03189999982714653, 0.028666792437434196, 0.031141316518187523, 0.029941780492663383, 0.03227595239877701, 0.030413053929805756, 0.031815122812986374, 0.032739829272031784, 0.032982632517814636, 0.03992648422718048, 0.031430575996637344, 0.03440440446138382, 0.023989036679267883, 0.03259192779660225, 0.028635583817958832, 0.03213879093527794, 0.033251870423555374, 0.029869476333260536, 0.0334426648914814, 0.028362855315208435, 0.03437149524688721, 0.03532933071255684, 0.03377583622932434, 0.029212921857833862, 0.032782360911369324, 0.03157100826501846, 0.028632977977395058, 0.028904011473059654]]}
