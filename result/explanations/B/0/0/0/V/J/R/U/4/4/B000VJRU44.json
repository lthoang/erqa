One of the Wii fit activities was jogging in place with the controller in your pocket, not even using the balance board, as you watch the bland scenery, ugly graphics, and annoying Mii's run with you.  Another was step aerobics.  An actual step DVD program would be more fun then this robotic and slow-paced step on, step off, step on, step right crap.  Graphics were bland and games weren't really that innovative in my opinion.I feel this is a fun little toy, (more or less an expensive scale) but overall, just another short-lived peripheral for the Wii, unless they can find some actual fun and innovative uses for it.  How many peripherals until we've had enough.  Anyone else tired of those Mii's yet, I know I am.", "I can see why this is so intriguing and such a HIT with women esp stay home mums.A range of interesting exercises to choose from. Cardio, Stretching, Yoga, Running and other fun sports like Skiing, Tightrope walking etc  Your kids will love it too.A personal coach and inbuilt tracking system to trace your progress. Weight, BMI over time.The balancing board checks your portage, balance and helps you correct your posture.Get one already!", "\"In a country where obesity is a growing epidemic I think every house should have a Wii Fit. I'm not a big fan of the Wii in general, it can be fun but it is not for serious gamers, but I think the Wii Fit Board is a different thing altogether. The software is weak in organizing and tracking workouts but sadly this is the best option for fitness gaming you can find. This \"\"game\"\" has plenty of challenging and fun exercises. Oddly enough the best aerobic workout included in the game,running, does not use the Wii Fit board. You put the controller in your pocket and it acts a pedometer as you follow a running partner around an island. Running in place may seem boring, but this game makes it fun and interesting.The balance and other aerobic games are where the fun is at. Doing the hula hoops or blocking soccer balls is a blast. The skiing challenges are frustrating and non-intuitive but given time I may grow to like those games as well. Bottom line there is bound to be some part of this game that you like and if it gets you off the couch or adds some variety to your workout schedule than it is worth the cost.I hope the success of this catches on and a slew of fitness games come out for this system. Better yet, I hope the Xbox 360 will come out with even better games. The Wii is too much of a kid's toy.\"", "\"First of all, remember that this is *not* a \"\"game\"\". Its a way to get your 40 minutes of daily exercise without making it feel like a lot of work.What this means is that you probably won't buy this for your under-11 year old. Before you start the \"\"game\"\", you are asked for an objective ... in terms of how many pounds you want to gain/lose. Whether this question is meaningful for your child depends on many factors - and other reviewers question the use of the BMI measure for kids, anyway.The only true game component of this are the \"\"Balance Games\"\" which turn your balance board into a snowboard, or into a tightrope, etc. However, I don't expect kids to return to this game everyday just to play. In short, its not a replacement for Wii Sports.So, how does it fare as an exercise regimen?Not very well so far. I use an elliptical for aerobics, and a [...] machine for strength training, and I can't see myself as shelving those two in favor of this toy. With the elliptical, I can adjust the resistance, get feedback on my calorie burnout, and can determine how long I want to keep going. Best of all, I can even watch TV, listen to music, or read a magazine if I care to.With the Wii Fit, the cutesy graphics are good, but once the novelty wears out, I'm guessing the chinks in its armor will begin to show. My TV is taken up by my virtual Mii running along, I get to listen to canned music, and there's really no way I can read along.Strength training is purely isometric exercise based (such as push ups). So, if you're fairly fit and need to work with additional resistance, this is not the place to come find it.Yoga is where it truly shines. I tried the breathing exercises and a few of the postures, and the instructions were fairly detailed and easy to follow. I expect that I'll use this as a cheap and convenient personal yoga instructor for months to come.The final aspect worth mentioning is core muscle control and balance. I particularly enjoyed learning how my body is balanced, and it does highlight whether you tend to favor one leg over the other. I can see this as being a worthwhile tool as part of a physical rehabilitation or therapy regimen.To summarize - if you have trouble getting motivated to exercise, or get bored by exercise machines at home, or can't get to a gym, and you don't care about its limitations, then this is for you.For those who are really serious about losing weight or getting fit, either setup a home gym or get a gym membership. This will be fun, but will likely be a large waste of your time. The biggest problem would be the inability to set up a sequence of activities that you could run through one after the other. Having to navigate menus to start up the next set is distracting. There is a Favorites tab that lets you get close to achieving this - but I haven't tried it enough to see if its a good replacement.I'm still in the \"\"novelty\"\" phase - so I'm going to try and make this work. I like the way it tracks your weight/BMI, which is much better than the paper and pencil approach I use currently. However, as stated before I expect to use it more for the balance and yoga portions, *after* I've completed my aerobics/strength activities on more conventional machines.Bottom line - as with every Wii product, the apparent \"\"shortage\"\" drives up demand and makes this seem more desirable than it should.As long as you are aware of its limitations, you're in the best position to determine whether this is for you.= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =Update (Week + 1):I've averaged about 30 minutes/day in the past week using this product, and here are some updates to my initial observations:(a) I've been surprised with how interesting the kids find it. They can't wait to get higher scores than me, and are constantly pushing to get ranked higher in almost all activities. Every evening I come home to scores that are better than mine, and am forced to play catchup. The balance games were an expected favorite, but I certainly didn't expect push-ups and the tree pose to capture their fancy.(b) The menus are nagging at best, and annoying at worst. My workout style is to focus on the activities at hand without needless conversation/distraction, and that's hard to do when I have to repeatedly click the A button just to get started. The text has this annoying teletype format as it prints across the screen, and can't be dismissed until it is displayed in its entirety.(c) This is compounded by the fact that this device can be very chatty. While some of the messages are good to know, I'd really like the option to turn these off. Counting the number of messages that I need to click past has become a running joke for us now.(d) Because I can't automatically string together activities in a logical sequence, I need to have the Wii-mote handy. Finding a home for it is a challenge when I don't have pockets, or need both hands for balance and can't be bothered to hold on to it (as in some of the more kinetic strength activities, or the yoga poses that need my fingers locked together).(e) Even worse is that you need to aim the Wiimote at the screen to click the menu buttons, which is an exercise in frustration. I'm mastering the art of using the arrow keys (the rocker switch) and the A button while the Wii-mote is in my pocket, but its still a problem when I hit the wrong button, which I seem to do frequently enough :((f) A yoga/gym mat is a necessary accessory - otherwise having to lie on your back when doing the jackknife for your abs means your flooring comes in contact with a very sweaty T-shirt. I'm not so certain about the silicone cover. We've used ours pretty rough, and I don't see any serious stains or dirt on it. And anyway, I like my workout machines to show some wear as a badge of honor :)(g) There is a half baked interface which allows me to track activities that I do outside of the Wii - such as jogging. So far, I've been logging my other workouts, but since I don't seem to earn Wii points for those, I can't tell how that factors into the overall Wii experience.(h) The BMI/weight tracking using a line graph, is really a nice touch.(i) Rather than a primary weight-loss device, I use it as a nice way to wind down from a heavy workout, and it serves that purpose very well. A commenter below questioned its usefulness for yoga. True, it does seem funny to learn yoga from a game console - but the funnier thing is that the yoga poses do seem to work very well to ease up strained muscles. Combine this with the immediate feedback as to how well you are balanced, especially on single leg poses, and you have a really unique combination.(j) The balance games are fun, but I tend to spend only a fraction of my time on them. I'm willing to take Nintendo's word that its good for me, but I'd rather spend my scarce exercise minutes on the other Wii Fit activities. After all, there's only so many times I can enjoy riding my bubble to the end of the stream.(k) The fact that the balance board is wireless is a wonderful touch. Its easy to hide it under the couch when its not in use.\"", "I would like to say that this is by far one of the best investments i have made.  The wii has been able to involve workouts in a fun and comprehensive way that has made it much cheaper, fun and enticing than going to a gym.  If you were a little overweight and ashamed of going to the gym, or had a lack of time/ money to make it to the gym this is for you.ControlsWii balance board and remote.  The balance board is the best device i have ever seen constructed.  It works on carpets and on hardwood floors.  The board weighs you every day and is able to determine how much preasure you are placing from one foot to the other or how your balance is distributed.  While doing the exercises it shows you where your ideal balance should be placed and helps you align your body properly to get the most of your workout.  The wii remote is used for some tasks like running or jogging.  While in your pocket or in your hand it can determine how fast you are moving just by it being on you. 5/5GraphicsThe graphics are typical wii 3d graphics.  Nothing above the ordinary but what you should be expecting.  If you go for a jog and take an island lap you see a very pretty island with the water along your side.  Its enough scenery to keep you running because you want to see it all.  The side games like balance and skiing look pretty good. 4/5GameplayYou get Aerobics, Strength, yoga, fitness, and minigames all in one.  Personally they are all fun to do.  Aerobics and strength are my favorites.  If you want a break you can cool off with some yoga and or minigames to work on your balance.-Aerobics you can do jogs walk up and down on the balance board and do some boxing along with other things.-Strength you can do crunches, pushups, twists and so on.  These are the workouts people dread but they are executed flawlessly and actually add fun to the game.  As you start out you might have a task to do 10 crunches.  As you do this and complete this task a few times then a new version of 20 crunches will appear. And it will go up further and further untill you get to a challenge mode which lets you go 1 on 1 with your trainer to see who can do more of the task before quitting.  This is the real challenger right here.-Yoga you get simlar yoga poses like the half crescent, or the tree.  You are required to keep your balance while preforming these poses and giving deep inhales and exhales.  The board measures even the slightest movement in your balance and encourages you to do better and better every time.  This is more relaxing and can be used pretty well inbetween things like running and crunches to give your body some cool off time.-Games are there to help you learn how to balance and align your body properly for other various activites in wii fit.  Some tasks might require you to balance on the board to move marbles around.  Or even move a character around an obstacle maze with the balance on the board.  The games add some fun and excitement to the game and are a nice breakaway from working out.5/5 for gameplay.All and all the wii fit is a recommendation for everyone.  Adults and kids alike will have fun enjoy themselves and keep in shape.  You are given a personal trainer that guides you through your workouts.  At the beginning you get a body test that measures your weight and determines what your body mass is.  Then you are allowed to determine what you want to accomplish with your weight, within a certain time line.  You can set goals for yourself that include loosing poundage, gaining pounds or staying in the same weight class.  You can then check in on your goals every day and see how your overall weight control has been going on a daily basis.  On a side note there is a clock that measures how much time you have invested each day.  When the clock hits 30 minutes you have reached your daily goal and it will tell you.  On a side note the game is designed to warn you when you have worked out for an hour time.  Once you hit the 1 hour mark it gives you a notice that asks you to take a 10-15 minute break and drink some water.  This is a great tool and encourages people to not overdo it.", "Wii Fit is a great product, but you need to be clear about what it is and who's meant to use it.  People who only exercise very casually or want some casual exercise to add on the side to their more rigorous routine will do very well with it.  If you're not already highly fit there are definitely aerobic options that will get your heart pumping, balance and yoga options that will leave you wondering how you managed to stand upright before you got more coordinated, and strength options that will have you aching for days.The games are fun, and since it tracks your time and makes charts of the results it can be very motivating for people who have trouble motivating themselves in other ways.  It can also be fun as a way to playfully compete with other people in your household and motivate each other that way.On the other hand, if you're extremely busy and need to pack a really solid workout in the absolute minimum amount of time, Wii Fit is probably not going to be your best choice.  Most of the workout games are fairly short, so a lot of time ends up being spent on getting feedback from the game and on selecting what the next game will be (if you want to maximize your workout though, you can step off the wii fit board during these parts and at least walk in place).  Really, you'll probably be better off with a DVD workout in that situation than you will with this product.I'm sure this is obvious to most people, but also Wii Fit won't make you an athlete of any kind if it's all you use as well.  If you use it very seriously you'll certainly see substantial improvement, but if you become serious about something like the Yoga, at some point you're going to want to move beyond doing one isolated pose at a time into doing full routines that flow from one pose to the next.On the subject of the Yoga, generally the descriptions of poses are very good, though there are some minor errors.  Even some people who are serious about the topic might find it interesting to get more feedback about exactly where they're placing their center of balance in order to fine tune a few positions.It's really a great product overall if you're trying to use it for what it was designed to do.  It's particularly great for giving so much balance training, since that's an area that many people don't otherwise think about much at all (and is an extremely important area of health, especially for older people who become prone to injure themselves in falls due to failing balance).  It really can be good exercise if you pay attention and try to do the activities well (and you're not already extremely fit, since for those people it's probably not strenuous enough).Have fun!", "We bought the Wii Fit board with a Wii several weeks ago based on an idea that it would give us good exercise and it would be fun to use. It was a good idea! The Wii Fit board is fun, and it can be a real work-out as well. I like to start off my work out with Yoga, then do some strength training, and top it off with a run in the aerobic section.The games are great too. They have a competitive edge as you are rated for your performances in all of the areas of the Wii Fit. If you get first place in your favorite game, and then someone plays it when you are not present, you might come back to it with someone having bumped you from your glorious first place spot and have to work harder to replace your good standings.When you get your Wii fit, pay attention when it says not to overdo it. You can wake up with sore muscles if you do too much!The Wii Fit has some great Yoga exercises and a lot of strength training moves to tone and firm up your body. You can work toward a goal of say, losing 5 pounds over a month or so, and you can see your progress from day to day. We have three children and everyone has enjoyed the Wii Fit board - it's also a great way to exercise during the cold winter months.It's been a great investment.", "\"My wife and I are in our *early* 30's and we have found that the Wii Fit is the game that we use the most on or Wii. I have delayed writing this review by about 2 months to make sure that we continued our use - and I am happy to report that we are still enjoying using it on regular basis.One thing to note is that the Wii fit alone will not turn you into lean-mean-fitness-machine but it can be a helpful part of the process. Many of the games are marginal in calorie burning (like the penguin fish game), but are designed to help you with \"\"balance\"\" - which seems to be a bit of a reach.  Other activities such as \"\"stepping\"\" , \"\"hoola-hoop twirl\"\" and \"\"rhythm boxing\"\" can help you shed a few calories. My wife really enjoys the yoga selections that are offered.One complaint is that your fitness age and the size of your character is determined strictly by your BMI. I understand that this is recommended method, however people who have spent time in the gym strength training will generally be recognized as being overweight. For example, every linebacker in the NFL will be labeled as obese. It wouldn't be that big of a deal except that your Wii Fit character looks like a walking beachball!One noce feature is that the Wii Fit offers additional activity logs and a fitness tips. This helps remind us that additional exercise and proper nutrition are components to a healthy lifestyle.Pros-- The daily checking of BMI and weight can help keep people motivated to maintain their exercise regimen.- Most of the games are pretty fun - Top 10 performances are kept to help you compare to other users within your household.- Everything seems to be very well thought out. The games have an authentic athletic feel (even the ones that are not rigorous).- Appropriate for all ages - in all honesty this is the rare game that is good for 3 three to 93.- Price - Nintendo could have charged well over $100.Areas for improvement -- It would be nice if more than one person could be \"\"logged in\"\" at a time. If my wife wants to challenge my score I must exit out of all of the menus. She would then select her figure - get weighed - read a fitness tip and so on.- BMI is leaned on a little to heavily (no pun intended) this may alienate people who are more muscular than fat.- It is a little unkind to people who are bigger. I guess it is meant to serve as a motivating factor, but some people may see it as being insensitive.Overall, I highly recommend the Wii Fit - in fact, it is the one game that should motivate you to buy a Wii. While it is not the answer to total fitness it can be a useful voice in making fitness a part of your daily life.5 stars\"", "The Wii fit craze is an innovative method of exercise.  You start out with establishing a profile giving your Wii fit age and Body mass index.  It was funny seeing my Mii change from a small guy to a big plump Mii.  So even though my body fat is low, the Body Mass Index is high.  There is a caveat to just assessing body composition by one parameter.There are 4 different methods of exercise.  Strength training, yoga, aerobics and balance exercise.  I never thought that a video game system would actually wear me out like an exercise video would but this can and will challenge you physically.  As you continue your fitness pursuit, you can track your progress.Of the games, I feel that the Ski slalom and snowboard slalom to be the most fun of the group, with the tightrope as a distant 3rd.However, the best value of this package is the versatility of the balance board to use in other games.  As more and more games are developed to take advantage of this peripheral, it will become a must have in your Nintendo Wii system.I highly recommend this system not only for the Wii fit disk but also for the balance board which really adds to the allure of such a versatile gaming system.  Once you sync the board to your system, you are set.  However, I strongly recommend rechargeable batteries since it appears to drain through batteries faster than other Wii remotes.  The board is solid in construction and wide enough for most individuals.  It is surprisingly heavy and sturdy, too.CAVEAT: There is a stated limit of 300 lbs for users.  I would personally go 10% under that limit if you want to be safe.", "As someone who's been working out for well over two decades I was skeptical whether a gym veteran like myself could actually get a decent workout using the WiiFit particularly since most of it is done standing on a small plastic platform several inches off the ground. By and large I was quite impressed by what Nintendo was able to do. I couldn't imagine how they could manage strength exercises but they did, although a vast majority focus on the abdominals and lower body.What I liked was how I was able to work the body in new ways particularly focusing on the core muscles and balance. My favorites were the yoga poses and balance exercises that included skiing and tightrope walking. When it comes to cardio I enjoyed the running where your Mii jogs around an imaginary island. In some ways the WiiFit opened my eyes to many other possibilities for the Wii including perhaps a full fledged running game. I know that the new Shawn White snowboarding game uses the balance pad apparently with considerable success. Even the modest skiing and snowboarding games on the WiiFit felt MUCH closer to actual skiing than anything you can simulate with a controller.Although the WiiFit is an excellent effort here are some suggestions to make the WiiFit even better.1. The WiiFit does a rather strange test to check your fitness that does nothing more than run you through a short balance test. It then determines your `real' age. Since the nanchuck attachment is almost totally unused by the WiiFit why not add a peripheral to check your heart rate and give a better test of endurance and conditioning?2. The WiiFit spends an excessive amount of time on non workout related filler. For instance it gives you a warning every single time an exercise comes up that may cause the user to lose balance. After each exercise it shows coins going into a piggy bank with the number of minutes you've banked, displays the ranking of your score and gives you a post exercise pep talk. It's all well and good but it breaks the momentum of your workout. My suggestion would be to allow users to create a routine and then work through that routine without the filler. The way it's set up it feels more like a series of mini games than an actual workout. Also, why not have some preset routines that focus on weak areas. It seems like this would be a small addition since the hard part of creating the exercises is already done.The main problems I see is that the WiiFit plays more like a toy than a legitimate workout for experienced athletes. On the other hand the gamelike feel may encourage beginners to keep with it. I highly doubt the WiiFit is going to cause a health revolution in the United States but as the first of its kind it's very well down.", "I was skeptical that a video game could ever lead to exercise, but my wife wanted this game so I got it. Sure enough, I lost 20 pounds using it. It's definitely a fun and entertaining way for people like me who get bored in a gym. I particularly like how it has a series of games that you can beat, which makes it seem as if your exercise regimen has a larger goal - to get the highest score.Most of the exercises are aerobic, with some limited strength training. However, it doesn't have enough strength training for people interested in body building or muscle development. Rather, it is primarily a way to promote fitness and fun at the same time.", "Great accessory for the Nintendo Wii, play with this are very fun and good for the health too, i recommend !!!", "\"I just recently received my Wii Fit and I have to say that I'm generally impressed.  First of all, the exercises presented work well.  If done properly without any cheating you will definitely raise your heart rate and will probably \"\"feel the burn.\"\"The Good:==> It functions as a very accurate scale, although I noticed that if it is placed on a thick, spongy carpet it registers my weight about 10-20 lbs lighter than I actually am.==> Exercises are well explained by the onscreen trainer.==> Challenging exercises... some of these are really hard, especially at first.  But they are hard in a good way.==> Fun little balance based mini games.  I especially enjoy the Ski Slalom and the Marble Tilt games.==> Built in progress tracking system.==> Menus are very easy to navigate.==> Doesn't cost $50+ per month like my gym membership does.The Not So Good:==> It doesn't have a \"\"Workout Program\"\" that links your exercises together.  You must interrupt your flow by selecting new exercises in between each set.==> Weight limit of 330 lbs.  If you are really heavy, regardless of your fitness level, this \"\"game\"\" is not for you.==> Uses BMI (Body Mass Index) to evaluate your fitness.  BMI is generally a great indicator of healthy weight except that people with large amounts of muscle mass can be mislabeled as obese, regardless of whether or not you can bench-press a truck and run a marathon before breakfast.  BMI is also not very accurate for a lot of children.==> Wii board width.  I wish they would have made it a little wider.  I'm a moderately built guy and I found the push-up positions to be awkward.  The balance board doesn't really allow for much flexibility in how wide you can place your arms.  I imagine that people with much broader shoulders will find this uncomfortable.==> Minimalist graphics.==> Bland music.Overall, I highly recommend this product as a supplement to your regular exercise routine, especially for days when you can't make it into the gym.  As a stand alone workout regimen it is fairly limited but effective.\"", "I was lucky to have pre purchased this product through Amazon months ago, but waited to really try it for a prolonged period before reviewing.  There are a lot of pros as well as a few cons.  Let me begin by saying that my two teenagers and their friends use this as well and the balance board holds up beautifully.  Now to the pros:1st..fun, easy to use2nd...quick workouts for quick weight loss3rd...use whenever...you're at home..use it naked if you want!4th...no gym fees5th...did I mention FUN!**There are many more pros, but I am sure you get the jist.Cons:1st..and it's a biggie!...SHUT UP WII PERSON!the computer is to talkative..heaven forbid you are gone on vacation and don't use for bit.  I don't care if I haven't worked out for week...I was on vacation!2nd...another biggie...my idea of overweight and Wii's idea are two different things!  I really don't like how it calculates weight.  My husband is a twig and he is overweight?  My son, 6 feet is obese?  Please.  I work in the medical profession, I know weight...this bugs me.Overall, I do use this.  The kids and their friends use it and have fun, which is what it is meant to do, but I could really live without the little WII voice.  I would like to jump on the balance board, choose my activities and be off on the road of fitness without traffic lights.", "I bought my 62-yr old mother a Wii and Wii Fit, this is somebody that never play video games or go to the gym, she now gets some exercise every day, and have fun doing it.  thanks nintendo!", "\"\"\"Wii Fit\"\" is one of the first games to make physical fitness friendly and accessible for all ages.This isn't the first physical fitness game--Konami did it first with \"\"Dance Dance Revolution\"\" on the PS One. However, \"\"Wii Fit\"\" is superior to it by making the action much less based on competition and sweating 'till you drop.It plays more like a physical fitness all-in-one video, with exercises for strength-building and aerobics. There's plenty of yoga positions and balance games. However, it excels as a physical fitness instructor for people who aren't typically health nuts. The balance board is necessary for people to find their true center of balance.It seems a little silly and embarassing at first, but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Whereas DDR was solely about fast-paced foot-stepping and loud music, \"\"Wii Fit\"\" is all about keeping people comfortable while staying fit. With the cute, cartoon-like Miis exercising along with your movements, exercise is much more fun than you might expect.Some of the games and exercises don't work as well as they should. I really couldn't figure out how to get a high school in the lotus game, in which the person must sit cross-legged on the balance board and remain as still as possible. Other exercises, such as the last Yoga poses, lack the interactivity of the balance board.Still, the balance board is an excellent measuring stick for people to maintain a center of balance. The actual challenge is in maintaining the proper form--by keeping your balance so the red dot on the screen doesn't escape from the yellow area. It's like an optomotrist eye check, only without the eye strain. The colors on screen are light pastels against a white background, making everything easy on the eyes.Wii Fit may not be the most groundbreaking, exciting game of the year, but it certainly is the most innovative and useful one. It's definitely worth the high price, and people will definitely want to upgrade to \"\"Wii Fit Plus\"\" if they enjoy the original.\"", "Wii Fit, like all Nintendo Wii (and DS) products, is polished and immaculately presented. Its very approachable and friendly. The Balance Board is a tremendous piece of kit - rock solid and absolutely excellent at what its supposed to do.As a product dedicated to fitness, though, its pretty lacking. Now, don't get me wrong - it is far better than doing nothing (what I am used to doing), and actually has some nice perks to keep you going (like score tracking and an unlock mechanic). But it doesn't let you customize a workout, and progression advice is minimal. It literally just lets you do whatever activities at any time. Now, I could go to the gym and do exactly the same thing, but I still would want to get some advice from someone or something. Wii Fit doesn't do it!Another problem is that between activities, you have to stop and navigate menus. It'd be much better if there was a flowchart like menu for setting up workouts so you can go one after the other, keeping the heart rate up. This is a very serious deficiency and I wonder why Nintendo didn't put it in.All in all, as an introduction to fitness, its pretty good, and at $90 its really pretty affordable if you have a Wii already. but I really hope some other company comes out with a good fitness videogame using the balance board, with more workout and eating tips. That would really be a great thing.", "I have only used this now 3 times but I totally LOVE IT. I am so excited to continue to unlock new exercises and am shocked with how right on all the exercises and balancing exercises work. This is the best thing for my WII that I have never bought..", "Pros:- Really fun and a really different way of playing games (Soccer Goalie, Snow Boarding, Skiing, Yoga, Pushups, and the list goes on)- Batteries seem to last much longer than for Wiimotes- Good workouts, they make most people break a sweat; not to mention they encourage people to work out with weight goals and so onCons:- even though WiiFit considers me of ideal weight, I still feel that how WiiFit (the game) determines your ideal weight is really flawed. BMI (determining if you're fat by just height and weight) is really antiquated and near useless. It doesn't measure how much fat you really have, therefore it doesn't account for muscle mass. Consequently it may mistaken a really fit person for being 'overweight'", "\"The Wii Fit \"\"game\"\" for the Wii is far more than a game! It comes with a balance board and lets you practice yoga, strength training, aerobics and other fitness games with your very own Personal Trainer.First, how it works. There is a white plastic balance board you stand on, which is in essence a multi-part scale. It can tell exactly where you are standing on the board, and where your weight is. If you lean forward, it senses the weight shift. If you stand on one foot and wobble around, it can sense that wobble. *Precisely*.So for example, in the yoga area one of the exercises is \"\"tree pose\"\". This is the classic yoga pose you see with one foot against the other leg and the hands up in the air. You stand that way for about a minute. The Wii knows exactly how steady you are, and shows you a red dot dancing around the screen to show your fluctuations. Of course, if you are really good at this, it shows that dot calmly at rest.Being a scale, the system tracks your weight loss (or gain) each time you use it, and because you put in your age and height, it tracks your BMI as well. The charts show you how you progress each day, and what your daily exercises levels are, broken down by the various categories.You can choose a male or female trainer, and the trainer demonstrates the moves visually on the screen while you watch. So for push-ups, the trainer is on the screen, doing them properly, giving you advice on form and what to do. They tell you exactly what muscles you will be working out. They provide front-and-back views so you can get a better sense of what you're doing, and give audio messages as well so you know when to change position.There is really a lot of variety here. There are games like hula hoop and walk-the-tightrope to give you some fun. There are different levels of some games you can unlock. You can \"\"go for a run\"\" where you have the Wii controller in your pocket and run (not on the board) in place, while an interesting scenery scrolls past on the TV. The speed the scenery moves is based on your own running speed, so you can go faster or more slowly. You can even run with a friend!You are told NOT to jump on the board and in fact the game will restart a given level if you do, to help make that clear. The board is a scale, as mentioned, and they do their best to have you treat it relatively gently.You really can work up a sweat if you do harder activities, but there is a LOT in here for the out of shape to start slowly.Now all of this begin said, there are several downsides to this game that they really should have added in.First, they have lots of little short games - and no way to connect them together! You have to track down activity 1. Go through it. Then go back out to the menus and track down activity 2. It can take literally a minute to go between one thing and the other, with lots of button clicking. They should have let you string together \"\"my fitness set\"\" to do this more easily. They do have a \"\"favorites\"\" menu that lets you see the 10 things you do the most, but it's not the same.Next, they don't recommend anything at all based on your weight / BMI. You are completely on your own to know what to do. You can tell it \"\"I want to lose 20 pounds in 6 months\"\". Fine. It doesn't give you any help or guidance at all. No \"\"hey you lost 20 calories\"\" or \"\"only 10 minutes to go!\"\" You have to make your own plans. Normally this is what a trainer does for you - so their virtual trainer is pretty useless.Which goes into another thing a real trainer would help you with - the order of activities. Muscle groups work in combination with each other and you should warm up, then do a combination of activities, then cool down. The Wii Fit has no information at all about this type of planning. You could randomly choose things to do that all work out your legs for example and never touch your lower back. You could cause strain on your body by leaping into the higher activities without doing a warm up lower activity. This would have been SO simple for them to build into the system, but they did not.The scale unit tops out at 330 pounds. I work with many obese people and there are MANY people out there over 330 pounds who this system would have been ideal for. They can't use it. I know someone who was 270 pounds who used this and the system kept giving them errors. I know they can't have an infinite weight scale, but something a little higher end would have been very encouraging.To me these things are all \"\"really should put into Version 2\"\" issues. I will still give WiiFit 5 stars for being a groundbreaking entry into the video gaming world - something that can really change lives and help people become more healthy. There are all sorts of other \"\"would be great\"\" enhancement ideas - for example, if you hooked up a video camera, you could see how YOUR downward facing dog looked, to see if it matched the \"\"trainer\"\" on the screen. That could be hugely helpful for people.WiiFit is definitely a great software package - I wouldn't call it a game - and I highly recommend that everybody get their hands on one if they can. It's a system that appeals to all ages, is healthy for all ages, and is a lot of fun too.\"", "When Nintendo came out with the Wii a few years ago, it gave gamers a whole new appreciation in the way we actually play video games. With games like Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports and Super Smash Brothers Brawl, gamers of all ages have shown a great interest in the new ways we play video games. But, Nintendo has taken that motion gameplay worldwide with a whole new level with Wii Fit. Unveiled at E3 in 2007, it really showed a new method of the way we can use our bodies to flex and stretch in new shapes and forms to balance ourselves into a better fit life, and a whole number of great activities that are really more than meets the eyes, and might.Wii Fit for the Nintendo Wii is one of the most exciting titles to come out for the system this year. The gameplay is more about the motion and abaility to test you shape and movement of your body. You will work with a virtual trainer either male or female, who will help you guide your body to the better future you desire. There are activities that range well from simple aerobics and exercises like Yoga, push ups and Pilates, all the way to more aggessive activies like jogging in place through a run through the park. But, the minigames that you unlock along the way really bring out more of the challenge with the sensitive motion of the Wii balance board. The minigames range from line dancing step aerobics, all the way to balancing on a tightrope walk on a high wire, all the way to simple exercises like table tilt which is actually much easier to master by tilting your body to get the ball in the hole, without causing it to fall down.As I found out, trying the Wii Balance Board out at the Nintendo World Store on May 8th in New York City, the balance board is very sensitive to all your movements, so its takes percise accuracy and timing to master through some of the activites in each of the games like the Ski Jump and the Downhill Ski course. If you move too fast, you might lose points whther blocking a soccer goal or balancing to the top. The graphics look great and appeal very well with the gameplay, as well as the music to the game which is simple and elequent to the gameplay. Sadly, there are a few disadvantages to the game. The first is that the Wii board is extremely sensitive, so much that you can't even have your shoes on when playing the games, and could damage the Wii Balance Board. A second disadvantage is that the battery life for the balance board takes so much energy, that you'd have to constantly recharge the battery in the balance board.While Wii Fit does have a few errors, it is definitely proof that Nintendo really has made a whole new way on how we play video games. Wii Fit is very challenging for all gamers young and old and works pretty good addition to your Wii video game library. While I honestly wish the game could've cost a little bit less, the game it really worth the weight.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: C+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2-", "\"I do not know why I waited so long to get a Wii Fit.  I had the chance to get it early and on a discount from Amazon but I procrastinate.  It took us 2 weeks just to find one because they are all sold out.  They are selling them twice as much from 3rd party sellers at Amazon.Nintendo has did it again.  They made exercising so much fun.  The equipment itself is so well thought.  It looks very solid.  It is beautiful with very simplistic design.  For 89$, it is really a deal.  That includes the main board, Wii Fit disc software, batteries, manual and 4 foot extensions if you have a thick carpet.You can make your goals of much poundage you want lose in a certain period of time, then Wii Fit takes care of all the monitoring for you. There are four types of exercises: aerobics, balance, strength training, and yoga.  You'll be assigned your own electronic personal trainer.  Surprisingly enough, the trainer is also very knowledgeable and very willing to share his or her wisdom in physical training. Do not expect it to be the same as going to a gym.  Be realistic, it won't be the same as paying somebody to train you and use all the gym equipments.  Nevertheless, I have never sweat so much on a video game other than Wii Sports boxing.You can do running as if you are doing it outside of your home. Along the way you'll meet people you know (Mii's you have created) like friends & family members, dogs, waterfalls, and characters like Mario, Luigi, etc.  There is a game that is similar to \"\"Monkey Ball\"\" except you are doing it with your whole body instead of a handheld controller.  You will have fun too doing skiing, hula-hoops, tightrope walking...The whole family is happy and having so much fun.\"", "We are seniors, and my wife and I both enjoy this game.  The demo doesn't show the unlocked games.  My favorite right now is the tightrope walk. The balance games and aerobics are fun.  The strength training looks like a workout, and we haven't done them yet.  First impressions are very positive.  The directions say do it barefoot.  For group play-athlete's foot, anyone?", "\"I've only had my Wii Fit for a little over a week, but I'm addicted to it already.  The first thing I do each morning is weigh myself on it.  It has a very accurate scale, down the a tenth of a pound, even on carpeting.  It always has encouragement and I can see my daily progress on a chart.The exercises are divided into four groups:  aerobic, yoga, balance and strength.  My favorites are the balance games and the yoga.  I love seeing if I can beat my previous scores on the short games and end up trying them over and over.  The yoga is more difficult than I had imagined, but I've never taken a real yoga lesson so maybe that's why.Some things I really like about the Wii Fit is that I can do my weigh in first thing in the morning and then do the training later.  And if I only have time for 15 minutes of exercise, I can come back later in the day and it will add the additional minutes to my total time.  Sometimes I end up using it 2 or 3 times a day.  And there is a place to add exercise other than the Wii Fit games and training into the log.  I really like having an accurate picture of what I've done each day and what I weigh without having to worry about writing it down.The interface is so darn cute!  I love the little voice that says, \"\"3,2,1 measuring!\"\"  This product is motivating in a way that other methods aren't.  Some of the exercises aren't that strenuous, but you can always add a walk, run or an aerobics DVD to your exercise log.A nice \"\"game\"\" or group of small games that compliment the Wii Fit is the Active Life Outdoor Challenge.\"", "Wii Fit is pretty cool, and I think you should read some of the five-star and four-star reviews to get what I'm talking about here. When I saw the first commercial of Wii Fit, I did not expect there to be so much hype-it's like the next generation of Dance Dance Revolution. I do think it's pretty pricey, yet I didn't expect it to be that good. I read a one-star review with something about a carpet? That really sucks for them, but if you have a carpet and want to play, don't take that as a hazard. I have a carpet and the balance board works just fine on the carpet. If it's a really fluffy carpet (and I mean sink your feet in it fluffy), then yeah, maybe you shouldn't risk it. But it would be sort of weird saying you own a Wii, but don't have Wii Fit. After watching a parody, I expected it to be more boring than it was (watch it on YouTube). The parody was VERY funny, so I made fun of it a lot. But it's actually pretty fun. Even if you don't want to get fit (like me, I'm a teenage girl and healthy according to the Wii Fit so I don't really care) the yoga and strength exercises are really fun. Some of them are really hard, but on one I earned the name 'Body Builder', and on another one 'Yoga Trainer'. The trainers are also really nice. The games are kind of boring, soccer's way too hard for me, but the stepping game is pretty fun. I really recommend getting it, even if you're a hardcore video gamer that doesn't prefer the video games in which you have to move, like me (although I enjoy boxing, golf, bowling, and baseball). If you think it's a bit pricey, I can't blame you, it IS kind of pricey. But it's still (almost) as good as Guitar Hero/Rock Band, so it's a LITTLE reasonable.", "If you're the casual health conscious consumer wanting to loose a few pounds, don't waist your hard earned money on a treadmill or excercise bike you'll eventually get tired of.  Instead, invest $[...] in Wii Fit and actually have fun working out.  No, you won't get the same results you would going to the gym and lifting weights.  But you will sweat, you will get sore, and yes you will loose a few pounds if you use it daily.", "\"I think a lot of people are thinking of this as a game to play rather than what it is.Think of this as an exercise machine rather than a game.  There are some fun things on here like balance games and stuff like that, but the point isn't really to have fun.Imagine this as a treadmill or an elliptical or any other machine that you might bring into your house to work out on.  The folks that are saying \"\"I tried this and got bored with it in 10 minutes\"\" are the same ones who will buy exercise equipment and just let it sit and collect dust. If you have exercise equipment collecting dust in your house the Wii board will probably become a dust collector too.As far as the actual exercise goes I've found it to be a great complement to what I'm already doing. In a good week I'll work out at the gym two times and run at the school track three times.  This along with a couple miles a day walking the dog.  The Wii fit does not really replace the \"\"real\"\" thing, but it definitely provides a workout that will leave you panting and wide eyed at the realization that a \"\"video game\"\" could put you in that state.I doubt I will use this every day, but what it will provide me is a great way to break up my already existing (and sometimes monotonous) exercise routine.  Wii fit has a wide range of exercises to chose from that will let you switch things around and keep things interesting, and exercise parts of your body that might not normally get any attention.  It's also great for those vacation days or Sunday mornings when you want to get a good workout in but just don't feel like getting out of your PJ's.  Or for when you just need a quick pick me up before starting the day.Obviously you could do all of this stuff on your own without the TV.  Wii fit does provide a minimal amount of training help though (and although it can get a bit annoying) the training helps to keep your speed and balance where it needs to be to get the most out of the exercise.  I've found that to be really helpful, I didn't realize that my balance and posture were off when I was doing some of this stuff and trying to keep these things under control has proven to be part of the workout for me.The four stars is for the negative reinforcement that Wii fit gives.  Personally it hasn't bothered me too much, but I know how easily it is to get discouraged from working out, especially when you realize you have a long way to go to reach your goals.  There are a lot of insults and other discouraging traits that you get if you don't reach certain levels, all of which are covered in other reviews so I won't get into it here.  We all now though that you need to be encouraged to reach personal levels of fitness, especially when you have a long way to go.  Being told by the Wii fit on the first day that you are obese and a couch potato might not be that encouragement that some people need.In a nut shell, this is a great exercise machine and has the potential to really expand your routine, but can get pretty discouraging with its cute little insults.\"", "\"Leave it to Nintendo to give us not only new games to play, but new ways to play.  As guarded as I was initially about what activities would actually hold my interest, and how effective they would be, I am now doubly impressed by Wii Fit, both as a game and way to get \"\"fit\"\".  After only 2 hours of in-game activities (mostly Yoga and Strength Training), I can already say I feel quite a soreness in me, which is awesome proof of the game's effectiveness.  It is truly a new way to exercise, and is one that is both accessible and highly enjoyable at the same time.  Believe the hype: Get Fit.\"", "I love my wii fit.  When I don't feel like running outside or going to the gym it gives me an easy avenue for physical activity.  There are plenty of games to keep you busy day in and day out.  If you find it hard to get motivated to go to the gym the wii fit can help.  If you find it hard to get off the couch then nothing can help you.My only real complaint about the wii fit is that I can't make a workout.  Each time I play a game or do an exercise I have to select to go back to the menu, select my next exercise, hit OK, get off the board, wait for the game to load, then click to start the game.  I wish they had a feature to string a set of exercises together that would transition seamlessly from one to the other so I don't have down time in between exercises.  If they had this, I'd give it 5 stars.", "I have a job where I sit all day. After a long day at work I really don't feel like going to the gym and busting myself for any more amount of time. Call it laziness, because I'm sure that's what it is. I'll admit it. I'm lazy. I don't like gyms. I don't like long hikes and bicycle rides in the muggy hot sun during the dog days of summer.So here's the reason I gave Wii Fit four stars. Do I trust it to be a substitute for an actual gym? No. Do I think a programmed CGI instructor knows more than a flesh and blood trainer? No. Do I trust a computer to accurately tell me my BMI by simply taking my weight? No,But one thing Wii Fit has managed to do is get me off the couch and doing *something* that approaches the qualifications of being healthy for me. This is the first day I've owned it and I've already done more excercising in this one day than I've done in...well...way too long. It's fun. I've learned something new. I never thought I'd be doing Yoga. But here I am doing yoga.You can spend 10 minutes excercising. You could spend an hour excercising (much more than that may be pushing it). You can do what you want for as long as you want.It may not be a gym. It may not be a bike ride or jogging around the neighborhood. But it is fun and if that's what it takes to get you off the couch, then maybe you should take a look at it.", "\"The other night, after indulging in some greasy lower-Manhattan takeout, I received my Wii Fit from Amazon.  I put the box near the television, took some Rolaids, and resigned to test-drive Nintendo's new fitness machine in the morning.The next morning I warmed myself up for a high-tech exercise experience by playing some of Marvel's Ultimate Alliance and some Paper Mario on the Wii's Virtual Console.  After a few of hours warming up my fingers, I was ready for the Wii Fit.The game is simple enough to setup; the installation of some batteries and an uneventful synch up of the Wii Fit Balance Board with the Wii console are about it.My first session with the Wii started with entering the date, my age, getting weighed, and an initial body balance test.  Wii Fit used those data to calculate my Wii Fit age, an embarrassing 47, about 12 years ahead of my actual age. I immediately repeated the body test and scored an ego boosting age of 31.  Much relieved, I listened as the Wii helped me set fitness goals. It told me I should shoot for a body mass index of 21 instead of my 24 (i.e., lose some weight).Based on my Wii fit experience so far, the technology's strength lies in two areas. First is its variety. There's a large variety of strength, balance, aerobic, and stretching (yoga) exercises, with additional exercises unlocked after completing basic sessions. The more you use Wii Fit, the larger the selection of exercises.Wii Fit's second strength comes in its coordination of the balance board and the Wii's position sensing tech. The system does a good job of tracking where the user is and integrating that into game play.I like Wii Fit's aerobic exercises the best. In the meat-world, I enjoy running, so it wasn't really a surprise that I liked Wii Fit's running exercises. It gives me the opportunity to run with a dog, something my real dog shrugs off all requests for (She usually responds to my requests to run with a \"\"you're joking right?\"\" look.). If you have other Mii's on your Wii, you'll occasionally see them run by you. There`s also a never-ending supply of people waving at you and cheering you on during runs. Before Wii Fit, I'd never would have guessed running in place could be anything but boring and awkward.Again, the Wii's positioning system seems well suited to keeping track of my running-in-place gate. The running exercises start with short intervals and work up to a free run mode.  Be sure to wear sneakers while Wii Fit running.  Running in place can be hard on the forefeet.On the down side of the aerobic games, Wii Step seems to be a bit on the slow side. It's like a lazy Dance Dance Revolution.  It's not that Wii Step is boring, it offers some insanely catchy, but unvaried, music and the advanced version of the game is fairly challenging. The problem is that Wii Step didn't offer much of a workout.  In the accompanying video, when I look at my watch, I wasn't checking the time, I was checking my heart rate.  My average heart rate during Wii Step clocked in at around 110bpm, about my heart rate during moderate walking. Still, the ability of the balance board to detect my position was a real high point of Wii Step. Also, I swear I saw Greg Allman in the audience watching the virtual step class.I also haven't been able to get the hang of the aerobic boxing class.  Wii Fit consistently misses my left, or I have a terrible left. I can't tell which. On the plus side, the boxing exercises push my heart rate higher than the step classes do.  The boxing sessions also have the interesting initial shock of suddenly appearing shirtless with an overly butch shirtless man.The strength and yoga exercises are not as fun-oriented as the balance and cardio exercises, but are focused and straightforward with good instruction from very non-Nintendo appearing fitness trainers.  I'd never attempted any yoga until Wii Fit and was able to follow the exercises and feel like I was accomplishing some real stretching. The pushups with side-planks also offer a decent body-weight workout.Wii Fit's balance games have offered me the most challenges.  They're fun too. You get to play as a fishing penguin on an ice-float; see your Mii's transformed into rolling balls; play a boy in the bubble floating on a river; and do some skiing. A note on the skiing: the slalom steering is exactly the opposite of what you do during actual skiing (In the game, leaning to the left makes you go left.). That took some getting used to.According to my exercise watch, I've been burning between 300-450 calories per 45-55 minute session. That's less than what I'd burn at the gym, but more than what I'd burn playing Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, or even Resident Evil IV.I'm enjoying Wii Fit and I can feel some muscle soreness in my hips from the strength and yoga exercises I did yesterday.  I think that's the point of Wii Fit.  It offers palatable exercise in the privacy and convenience of my home. I'm more likely to play Wii Fit after a long day at work than I am to pack up my equipment and run to the gym.The only other note I'll make is that after four days of play, at about forty-five minutes per session, I've already had to replace the Wii Balance Board's four AA's. Having rechargeable on dock is advisable.\"", "I was one of the first people on our block to own a Wii system.  I loved the Wii sports that came with the system.  Since then, I have purchased several titles and have been disappointed each time.. exception is guitar hero that came out.  But this Wii fit has taken the cake.  I really like this game.Now, I have only owned Wii fit for several hours when I wrote this report, but here it goes.The Wii Fit board requires little to no time to put together.  The board runs on 4 AA batteries (included), place CD is Wii, press sync button and you are on your way.  Quick note... If you weigh over 330 pounds than you will have to be sneaky to get the system to work for you..My biggest dislike is tyga part of Wii fit.  I am not a limber person, and some of the poses are impossible to do for me.Most of the exercises do not last long enough for your heart rate to reach 80% and stay there so rather or not the Wii fit will really make ya loose weight is up in the air, but the step aerobics are really cool.Some improvements that I would make in the game would be to let the user setthe  amount of time/distance or just use the default.  Also, like on the run, a have Mii characters that you are competing agianst.Don't get me wrong, this is a great device and I am glad that I spent the money on it.  This is a great piece of technology and i hope it helps to keep people in better shape, people lke me."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030971204861998558, 0.06285861134529114, 0.08601589500904083, 0.034971415996551514, 0.0021459762938320637, 0.0430295467376709, 0.03706458956003189, 0.03615879267454147, 0.05620809644460678, 0.03585904836654663, 0.018951084464788437, 0.03797471895813942, 0.02522916905581951, 0.034910161048173904, 0.03223216161131859, 0.0013628191081807017, 0.02028123289346695, 0.052910201251506805, 0.04006335139274597, 0.03848423808813095, 0.004355537239462137, 0.001282965880818665, 0.04041706770658493, 0.007909552194178104, 0.037307001650333405, 0.033140555024147034, 0.028430089354515076, 0.048463497310876846, 0.021202106028795242, 0.03587447106838226, 0.012538586743175983, 0.0013962768716737628]]}
