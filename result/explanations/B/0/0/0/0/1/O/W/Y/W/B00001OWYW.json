One of the games that made every kid want to own one is none other than Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  An excellent Playstation title and there's no doubt in my mind that it's the greatest Castlevania game on the face of the earth.  Don't believe me?  Too bad, now read on anyway:THE GOODYou play as Alucard, the son of Dracula, and he's improved over his Castlevania III(NES) version.  The whole castle environment is done in the same vein as Zebes was in Super Metroid; in fact, the whole game borrows from Super Metroid!  You might think that's bad, but the gaming geniuses at Konami utilized that tactic and made it worthwhile.  The soundtrack kicks...especially Richter Belmont's theme (speaking of which, he's also a playable character).  The graphics were state-of-the-art for the Playstation's debut and they're very stylish and, of course, in the Castlevania style.  Also, being a huge fan of Super Metroid and Castlevania, this game not only throws in its own goodies, but has that good ol' \"\"old school\"\" feel to it.  This game also has items GALORE and you can collect cards to cast magic spells and use familiars.THE BADAside from the ending credits song that grates on my nerves (\"\"I am the Wind\"\"), I find absolutely nothing wrong with the game.  If you do find something wrong, consult your physician.OVERALLSome might claim this as the best game of all-time; I can't claim that, but it's certainly the best in the long-running Castlevania series.  I doubt there'll be a Castlevania that will beat this one (for all you 64 lovers, Castlevania 64 and Legacy of Darkness AREN'T that great!).  Its superb gameplay and style marks this as a great game and it should never be forgotten.  If you've never played a Castlevania game before, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU START HERE.  If you hate this game, \"\"Have at You!\"\"\"", "\"It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it \"\"best game of all-time\"\" or \"\"best Castlevania game you'll ever play\"\".I don't think so.  If you want a \"\"real\"\" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.You're probably thinking by now \"\"Alright, talk about the actual GAME!\"\"  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.\"", "It's nice that all these great games for the original Playstation are being rereleased, especially for Castlevania fans. That's because Symphony of the Night, not only one of the best Castlevania games but also arguably one of the best for the PSX is one of the games being rereleased. Look up any review for the game from websites and magazines and you'll see nothing but praise for this classic. At [amt] from Amazon, how can you lose. Get this game.", "This is the first game I wanted to buy when I got my Playstation, sadly, it is super rare and took my 6 months to find used. This is probably the rarest Playstation game, which is sad, because it is also one of the best.It combines classic Castlevania gameplay with RPG elements, such as the use of magic, and level points system, and a deeper storyline. Also adding to the depth is the use of money, relics that give special abilities, and a wider variety of weapons. The ability to equip weapons of your choice is a first for the series. By far the coolest is the ability to transform, you can be a bat, a wolf, or fog (!). The main character is Alucard (spell it backwards), who older gamers might remember from Castlevania 3 for NES. You meed a wide array of characters, some good, some bad, throughout your journey through Dracula's castle. The object of the game: same as the rest-find and destroy Dracula and end the vampire bloodline.The graphics are classic 2-D, which might turn off some gamers hoping for something more like Castlevania 64 (which was fully-rendered 3-D). Despite the 2-D, the control and character movement is greatly enhanced thanks to better animation and smooth controls. Castlevania games always had great music, and SOTN is among the best in that department. Each score perfectly matches the given environment, with beautifuly orchestrated melodies. Don't let the old-school look discourage you, this is an amazing game.Calling Castlevania: SOTN simply a nastalgia trip, while true in my case, would degrade the value of the game. It is an excellent and addictive game that satisfies on almost every level. It ranks among the best games for the Playstation, and you sould expect to pay a hefty price for a copy. It is now super-rare.", "I played this game YEARS after it was released and could not believe how well it has held up. It truly is an amazing game. What makes this game so spectacular is the ambience it creates. Although the graphics are over 10 years old, the colors are soo vibrant, and the orchestrated score is fantastic- prolly the best of any video game ive ever played. Each portion of the castle is like an amazing  painting. It truly is a work of art. The castle is dark, creepy, and full of life. The plot is really good as well, (despite some horrid english acting that will be ridiculed untill the end of time. lol) You control Alucard, the half vampire and half human son of Dracula, as he tries to stop his father. Alucard is an awesome looking character to control and with constant upgrades to collect, it is rewarding to see him progress into a powerful force. This game laid the foundation for the excellent portable castlevanias on Nintendo systems but it still remains the best out of all of them. The ambiance, the music, the simple, but rewarding gameplay, and the colorful graphics still outdo its successors. Definitely one of the greatest games of all time.", "This game, which started the trend of all those terrific Gameboy Castlevanias, like Dawn of Sorrow, is an awesome play and a top 10 of just about everyones Playstation game list.First off, this game is huge. You have to play through this game twice to get the entire experience and real ending to this game. It has a second quest, much like the old school Ghosts and Goblins, if you can remember that game... but with its own unique invereted way.The amount of items you can gather and collect in this game is staggering too. There are numerous swords and spells to pick up and just about every weapon has its own special abilities which adds a lot to this game. Because of that no weapon seems the same.And the relics just plain old rock. They give you abilities like changing into bats, wolves, mist forms, and allowing you to do super jumps and double jumps to unlock new areas.Also, the hundreds of different bosses and enemies are all interesting to hunt down and slaughter. Especially the cool looking bosses, which can sometimes span an entire couple of screens...Though this game is extremely rare to try to get a hold of now, if youre a Playstation gamer or action fan then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Its one of the most complete and enjoyable action/adventure games of the last ten years.", "Love it or hate it, this is side scrolling action at its best.  I see that a lot of people complained that it borrowed from Metroid; I say kudos!  Metroid was also great and was in my opinion the best side scroller until SOTN.  You can read any number of reviews for the particulars, but I want to point out that this game is available for $9.99 to download from the PS3 store onto your PS3 or PSP.Oh yeah!", "Where do I begin? I have played the first four classic entries of the series, and Lament of Innocence, the Mercury Steam Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and I must say that not only was this entry released in Konami's prime, but they have given the name Castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience. The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before. Overall, this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series, and it is one that I would not mind playing again and again, as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of games.", "WTF is this crap, this is metroid not castlevainia......this sucks.  PS stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hair.", "\"There is a reason hand-drawn sidescrollers are still being made: there is so much expression in these games that cannot yet be displayed in polygons, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is no exception. The characters and backgrounds are very well-drawn, the tunes set the tone well, the controls are top notch, the storyline is great, and the animation is perfect.In addition to be to being quite possibly the best side-scroller ever made, Symphony of the Night's music holds true to the title with well-orchestrated tunes that only a jaded misosymphonist -yes, I made that up- could hate.As the story goes, Dracula rises once every century to terrorize the the innocents of Transylvania. This is where a Belmont usually comes in to thwart Dracula's evil plots and send him back to where he came from. When Dracula dies (albeit temporarily) his castle vanishes with him. This time, however, things are a little different.Only four years after Richter Belmont defeated the Count, Dracula's castle rises again. Maria Rennard, Richter's cousin who helped him defeat Dracula, decides to investigate the castle after her cousin mysteriously disappears.Over 400 years ago, Dracula was betrayed by his son, Alucard, who aided Trevor Belmont in Dracula's defeat along with Grant (a nimble thief) and Sypha (a vampire-hunting sorceress). Now Alucard, who had put himself into what was supposed to be an eternal sleep, has risen again to put an end to his father ... permanently!As Alucard, you fight Dracula's evil minions while exploring the castle and the ground upon which it sits. The castle itself is made up of main halls, a church, a bell tower, a courtyard, and a library, among other things. Under ground are the abandoned mine and the catacombs. Things get even more interesting when or if you get to an upside-down version of the castle, where you face an evil grim reaper in earth \"\"above\"\" the castle, and eventually Vlad himself.What I also like about the game is the way it somewhat portrays the real Vlad Tepes Dracule, with impaled victims in the background and an equally menacing portrait.So is there anything wrong with this game? Ofcourse there is!  While you will get the chance to play as Richter, you'll never be able to play as Maria unless you buy a Japanese Sega Saturn (or an American one with a mod-chip) and Nocturn in the Moonlight.Konami also screwed Maria when they released Dracula X on Super Nintendo in America. Maria was playable in the Turbo PC-CD version in Japan.\"", "So I get this game free with purchase of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (which is also a pretty good game). People say Lords of Shadow is a great game, but it is NOT a Castlevania game. So to figure out what Castlevania games are all about I give Castlevania: Symphony of the Night a try. AND WOW JUST WOW. This game is simply incredible. After finishing this game (both actual and secret endings) here is what I thoght.***************PROS********************CASTLE EXPLORATION GAMEPLAY: No spoiler here, but most Castlevania games are about going into Count Dracula's castle and finding and destroying him and in process of doing so, encountering and finding a great number of vicious enemies, some really awesome monsterous bosses and awesome weapons and upgrades. Similar to other Castlevania games, this one also has A HUGE CASTLE where you, the son of dracula, can roam around structure to another doing everything stated above.WEAPONS, SECONDARY WEAPONS, SUMMONS, RELICS, UPGRADES, TRANSFORMATIONS AND ALL TYPE OF SPLENDID STUFF: While exploring HUGE castle (emphasis on the word huge) you will find great number of different weapons (swords, mace, blades), secondary weapons (holy water, throwing axe and some weird things) and relics that will either allow you to summon various allies by your side or transform you into beasts with different abilities. Guess being a human sympathetic son of dracula comes with its own advantages. Search for these items will really push you explore the castle. While some are not so hard to find, the good ones are well hidden and will require a through exploration (or use of a guide).RIDICULOUS VARIETY IN ENEMIES AND TREMENDOUS BOSSES: Loved it just loved it. I was surprised to see there were so many different types of enemies in the game. To top it off, defeating them and making your way through the castle rewards you with spectacular boss fights. These bosses vary from your own doppelganger to almighty you know who. There are so many so many awesome bosses. JUST BE SURE TO EXPLORE THE CASTLE THROUGHLY.CASTLE AND REVERSE CASTLE: Now if you just rush through the game without exploring all the area, you will not get to challenge the real main boss of the game. To do so you have to explore the castle throughly, meet certain conditions and unlock the REVERSE CASTLE, which is practically a reverse version of castle you play, but with  tougher enemies and more awesome bosses. I can't tell you much without spoiling, but it is not hard to do. You just have to know something.LEVELING UP THE MAIN CHARACTER: Beating enemies and bosses will give you XPs and level you up making you stronger adding RPG element to the game. So if you are not as skilled then leveling up and then fighting the boss is always an option. I personally got addicted to this and finding items.GREAT GRAPHICS, ART, LEVEL DESIGNS FOR A PS1 GAME: Yup not much to elaborate here. I loved the REVERSE CASTLE design and idea. Again you have to play it to see what I am talking about.PLAY WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTER: In addition to son of dracula, you can also play as a Vampire hunter with very different abilities, you just have to finish the game once.******************CONS******************SECRETIVE PLACES: While you can get map of the castle early on, you still can't locate many important secret places on that map. I wish they had some type of secret map available so one wouldn't have to rely on online guides. Other than this I can complain about the graphics and stuff, but it is a PS1 game, so judging it by today's standard won't be fair.*************CONCLUSION********************If you are new to castlevania franchise and want to learn more, this is a great place to start. It will truly give you a good idea what Castlevania games are all about and why lords of shadow is a great game, but it is not exactly a Castlevania to be precise.", "This game, without a doubt, is by far the best game in the Castlevania series. Even if you previously havent played any of the other games it's still worth it. There's not much else to say besides it's a classic 2d game and perfectly dark. Alucard is a great main character....but that's not just the reason it's so good. Everything about it is great...from the 2d landscapes and backrounds...to the vast selection of weaponry and armor...and relics...all the way to the voiceovers. There are also tons of secret corridors that will take an eternity to find. Whether you like classic games or not you will probably like this...Forget those lamo N64 Castlevanias...this is where it's at...", "this game, just annoys me to the point i don't want to play it. the term Metroidvania doesn't do it justice if anything it insults the Metroid name because everything in Metroid is about exploration and everything is deliberate. SotN just teases you in the first part of the game and annoys you all together. so, at the start you play as Richter Belmont, picking up from Rondo of Blood, or Dracula X in the west. you reach Dracula and enters chessy voice acting. so your like oh ok, i can dig this, but you're already fighting dracula so what else is there to fight? fast forward a couple of years and now enters Alucard, running through the forest and jumps the gate. awesome scene, now your in control and this guy has a powerful weapon and armor. so everything just dies in one hit! yeah! just as powerful as Richter. then its taken away from you. that. is. so. not. cool. why the big tease?? where in development they thought was a good idea to show players Alucard's powerful equipment then have it taken away??  then the sense of direction. oh my god, after that big tease you follow the path and then after a while you explore but you can't because you need a relic to open blue door, but you need to find the relic, but you don't know where to find it! you find those relics laying around only that they supposed to be in the game already! not a fudging relic to show enemies names or the damage! its cryptic and its not known where to go. then the spells, its never told that you can cast spells to gain small health and summon a spirit. however! moving away from the negatives i will say that the soundtrack is amazing, and the graphics have aged well. its an ok title, much like Simon's Quest this game isn't for everyone and i'm almost done playing the game and i feel i've wasted so much time getting lost i just want to fight Dracula and get it over with! that's the point isn't? to get lost, waste time, get powerful, and then comes the endgame boss, your pretty powerful already, so you'll be disappointed on how the boss fight came out.overall, its an ok title, but to me its just more annoying than fun, i'm already level 21 and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy, but i'm nearly done with the game, so i have to beat it now. its a game that just wastes you time, all games are, but this one and simon's quest just literally wastes your time like no other. the portable games of Castlevania follow this formula now, which is disappointing. just try this game out for 5 minutes then you'll see what i'm taking about. its also an XBLA title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a PS1 title.", "This game is great on its own merits. However, it is a breakaway from the traditional Castlevania level based format. Second of all, you are not one of the Belmonts, or a human at all (you are a half-vampire). Thirdly, you do not have a whip, you have a sword. Despite the breaking of many of the Castlevania traditions, this is a spectacular game. Great graphics, great music, great gameplay. As a consolation, there is a way to play as Richter Belmont after beating the game.This is my second favorite of the Castlevania series, the best of all being Castlevania: Dracula X for the Turbo-Graphx 16 console. Do not play the Dracula X for Super Nintendo! It sucks!", "THIS IS PERHAPS THE BEST CASTLEVANIA GAME EVER MADE! I REMEMBER PURCHASING THIS GAME WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT ABOUT 9YRS AGO AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, THIS WAS VIDEO GAME CRACK FOR ME. THE MOMENT I STARTED PLAYING IT I JUST COULD NOT STOP PLAYING IT. ONE FRIDAY NIGHT I STARTED PLAYING IT AROUND 6PM AND DID NOT STOP UNTIL 5 AM ON SATURDAY MORNING, TOOK ABOUT A 4 HR BREAK AND THEN I WAS UP AGAIN PLAYING THIS GAME UNTIL I FINALLY FINISHED IT THAT SATURDAY AFTERNOON.", "I recommend this game to anyone of any age.  Although it has some nudity / blood, I think it's tame enough and reminiscent of the original era that it's more education than anything for youngsters under 10.  The music is probably one of the major perks.  I've downloaded and listened to the music on MP3 players driving around because it's THAT good.  The gameplay is simple as can be:  sidescroller, jump, attack, item, and magic.  There are literally hundreds of weapons, armor, etc items to find, it's amazing what some of the more rare special weaps do.  The game itself is pretty long too, once you beat it, you beat it again upside down and all monsters/music/items are changed to reflect your stronger levels.Anyway, there's lots and lots to describe of how awesome this game is.  If you've never played it, I pity you.", "No other series quite conjures the atmosphere associated with Konami's Castlevania series. Hearkening back to the days of the original Castlevania on the NES, the combination of classic monsters, from Frankenstein's monster to the Price of Darkness himself, coupled with a decidedly Japanese feel made for quite the gameplay experience, and luckily for us, the classics just keep coming. The latest in the series (sorry, while the 3D Castlevania games on the N64 are adequate, they just don't carry on the tradition), Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, is the first to not feature a whip- weilding member of the Belmont clan as it's protagonist, but rather the all-too-vampiric son of Dracula, Alucard, last seen helping Trevor Belmont in Castlevania III on the NES. Playing more like Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest, or even Super Metroid on the SNES, Symphony of the Night adds some RPG elements like the ability to gain in strength by levelling up, equipping items and an occasional NPC. While the gameplay is a bit different than previous games, this is a good thing, as it adds depth to the already tried and true play mechanics of the series.The first thing you'll notice upon beginning Alucard's quest, is that this is not your usual Castlevania title. More closely resembling Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (NES), or to be quite honest, Super Metroid (SNES), SOTN sprinkles the tried and true play mechanics with a good many RPG elements. The ability to equip multiple items (weapons, armor, items, etc.), level up to gain strength and the ability to purchase potions, maps and other items, even conversing with the occasional NPC (namely Maria), are all typical to RPG's and their addition to the Castlevania formula results in a game that's very much more than the sum of its parts. Dracula's castle and the catacombs underneath are a huge area to navigate, requiring some time in the early going (you'll soon open warp portals to speed your quest later), and as such, the map is invaluable as far as finding areas you have yet to explore (again, they took it straight out of Super Metroid). The thing is that to unlock certain areas, you'll need to acquire items or abilities. Indeed, the true challenge in SOTN is not only defeating Dracula, but being able to explore the entire castle, both normal and inverted. And lest you think all this will be a tedious chore, let me assure you that controlling Alucard is a small pleasure in itself. While his movement is very fluid, he controls wonderfully, and while it will be second nature to any Castlevania fan within movements, the additions of certain spells to Alucard's repertoire make mastery a bit more involving. And for those who would rather control a belmont, Richter is selectable later on by code, although the going is considerably tougher for him. Konami could not have delivered a more complete experience.While I refrain from calling Castlevania: Symphony of the Night the Playstation's best game in the face of games like Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid &amp; Xenogears, I must admit that if I was forced to choose but one, it may very well be it. I will say that it is an amazing title in all aspects, and sadly, as things seem to be unfolding, perhaps the last 2D Castlevania title. The latest two Castlevania games, both on N64, have been in 3D, and to be honest, quite lackluster. As fate would have it, the only other known Castlevania title in development is also in 3D, this time for Dreamcast, and while I can only hope it can recapture in some small way the splendor that is SOTN, one has to suspect that the inherent problems with the titles is that they are not 2D, which is the soul of the series. If you want a post 16-bit title that is truly Castlevania, there is only one route to take, and that is Symphony of the Night (or the Saturn import version known as Nocturne in the Moonlight, which actually has a couple of extra areas and a playable Maria).", "\"\"\"Die Monster! You don't belong in this world!\"\"This was the sort of reaction many long-term series fans gave Konami circa 1997-1998, when they first attempted to bring the Castlevania series into a 3D world on the N64. It wasn't a much better reception a few years later either when Lament Of Innocence & Curse Of Darkness both arrived on the PS2. Even though the rest of the world opted to go into 3D gaming because it was \"\"the cool new thing\"\" back in the 90s, few companies such as Konami & Capcom stuck to their guns and kept pumping out some amazing new (new at the time) 32-bit generation 2D titles... and the mighty Symphony Of The Night stood as the proud flagship and proof that 2D gaming is here to stay, no matter what the trends are.\"\"Wait a moment! You look familiar. And yet.... What do you here?\"\"Sporting tons of monsters, RPG elements, outstanding artwork, Super-Metroid style gameplay, a killer soundtrack, and huge areas to explore (as well as the \"\"other\"\" castle later on), Symphony took most of the best elements of previous Castlevanias, gave the series a massive overhaul in the structural and aesthetic departments and started what is essentially the 2nd generation of Castlevania games. To this day, it remains a gorgeous feast to the eyes, ears, and gaming experience that does in fact, stand the test of time. Although at the time, it appeared that this would be the big hurrah of 2D Vampire Hunting... that is, until the GBA arrived years later heeding the cries for more Symphony:\"\"It was not by my(Team Symphony's) hand that I am once again given flesh... I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.\"\"...Tribute in the form of \"\"Circle Of The Moon\"\". More titles arrived soon afterward such as Harmony, Aria, Dawn, Portrait, and the recent Excelsia, all of them spectacular in their own right, and yet still they borrowed heavily from Symphony's style, making this one the Granddaddy of Classic Metroidvanias.\"\"Tribute?! You steal men's souls and make them your slaves!\"\"Well... I'm not a slave to Symphony exactly, but I'll admit, this one's quickly become my favorite 2D game of all time due to the fact that I can keep coming back to it year after year and still find something new and fun about the game (try collecting all the rare items(!)). So I suppose it has stolen my soul. And while I can certainly see how newer generations of gamers could find so much to nitpick about it, this one remains a classic in my eyes... all bumps involved. So let's get the cons out of the way: Yes, most of the voice acting is terrible. Yes, the dialogue is cheesy as hell. Yes, the game's difficulty could be a little more challenging. Yes, the \"\"other castle\"\" is essentially the first one upside down. No, you can't get rid of all the inventory clutter of old items to make equipping items easier. But all in all, the gameplay stays amazing as it's ever had in the series, and a style that many gamers now follow to this day.\"\"Perhaps the same could be said of all religions...\"\"Controlling Alucard (and Richter) is as fun and fluid as ever, eliminating all the \"\"oh no!\"\" moments from previous games where managing your jumping direction was much more difficult. The animation of your character, the monsters, the castle details and even some of the 3D backgrounds are top notch for the PS1 as well. Definitely a labor of love. With all the special powers, relics & moves you can acquire throughout the game, you can turn your half-vampire/half-human from a simple dagger wielder to a force to be reckoned with. And by the time you reach your father Dracula, you too (along with Richter) will shout out:\"\"Your words are as empty as your soul. Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!\"\"And yes, for the first time in the series (aside from his small playable role in Castlevania III), you get to control Dracula's son. But when the Belmonts are essentially nowhere to be found upon Dracula's arrival (and thus, less whip cracking this time around), mankind seriously needs a savior such as Alucard to pick up the slack and put his father (along with Death, Succubus, and the Dark Priest Shaft) back in their places. Richter brought Dracula down years earlier, but it's up to Alucard to figure out why Richter disappeared as well. And so...\"\"Evil can only triumph when good men do nothing.\"\"And that leaves us with just one more question:\"\"What is a man(Metroidvania)? A miserable little pile of secrets!\"\"Secrets. There are LOTS of secrets. But this adventure is also an amazing ride into gaming history nonetheless. If you dig the Metroid style 2D gaming of the newer titles (or just any game like this period), then I HIGHLY recommend you pick up this game in any form you can. (It's also available on the PSP release \"\"Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles\"\" and Xbox Live Arcade, thus eliminating the need to hunt down the original for high prices [9/15/09 UPDATE: I learned that the voice acting changed in Dracula X Chronicles... for the worse. So it's your call]). I also suggest (if you haven't played them already):-Circle Of The Moon (GBA)-Harmony of Dissonance (GBA)-Aria Of Sorrow (GBA)-Dawn Of Sorrow (DS)-Portrait Of Ruin (DS)-Order Of Excelsia (DS)-Metroid Zero Mission (GBA)-Metroid Fusion (GBA)-Super Metroid (SNES)\"\"But enough talk... HAVE AT YOU!\"\"\"", "\"Castlevaina: Symphony of the night - Circa 1997GOOD:- Great-tight controls- Very large 2D world to explore- Hundreds of different enemies to battle- Hundreds of items and secrets to findBAD:- Graphics might seem dated to some- Voice Acting, is not that greatIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Multiple endings- A non-liner 2D side scrolling action RPG- Old school Platforming in a non-liner worldGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Super Metriod- Castlevaina X (Japanese version for the P.C. not the U.S. version on SNES)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Put your disc in the CD player and play Track 2 for a bonus music track- In the Castlevina Time line this game takes place after Castlevaina: Dracula X on Super Nintendo- The First part of the game states \"\"Final Stage: Blood Lines\"\" this is a recap of the last stage of Castlevaina: Dracula X, but to many it seems as if it's the last stage in Castlevaina Blood Lines (on Sega Genesis) because the level is called \"\"Blood lines\"\". Note Blood Lines is in reference to the Blood Line Dracula and Alucard share and not the game for Sega Genesis- There is an Extended version of this game for Sega Saturn- After beating the game in a certain way you open up a bonus world, which really is just an upside down version of the previous world- This game is now on Xbox Live Arcade. It was the first Xbox Live Arcade title to exceed the 50MB limit restriction, because of this game the limit has been increased to 150MB. The download comes with an HD version of the game (SotN now in Widescreen!) and a original unfiltered port of the game. As well as Xbox Live Achievements (12 in all). It sells for 800 Points or $10.00 USD- Konami also announced a port of Symphony of the Night will be included in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles for the Sony PSP. This version will be packed with a Copy of the Japanese Castlevaina: Dracula X (which was never put out in America before) as well as a total remake of Castlevaina: Dracula X (in 3D, but still plays like the 2D version), this PSP version of SotN will feature full screen graphics as well as a touched up localization in terms of all new voice acting.\"", "In my opionion this is the best CASTLEVANIA out there. This is a 2D game with some nice 3D backgrounds. You have alot of different weapons, spells, and other helpful items that lend support in your long journey. The enemies are very cool to look at (nice animation) however, that doesn't stop you from wanting to shead much blood. The game carries a &quot;T&quot; for &quot;TEEN' rating. There is quite a bit of blood in the game which is cool. I'm telling you right now and many of you know this..CASTLEVANIA: SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT is HUGE. You will have to back track alot in the game. With that being said, I will also say that even though you do alot of back tracking the game never feels repetitious. The gameplay gets a 100% without a second thought. If you own a PS1, dust it off and buy this masterpiece.", "Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night is a great example of how sequels should be done.  Even though Alucard uses a sword instead of the traditional whip, the game seems 100% worthy of the Castlevania title (Don't worry though, if you prefer the whip style of play, you can play through the entire game with Richter once you have completed certain tasks). The gameplay is tight and refined, the graphics are wonderful, there's tons of items and rooms to find, and the music fits each section of the game perfectly.  The 2 castles to explore are massive, but a teleportation system keeps you from having to back track the whole way by foot to get to a desired area. Every feature in this game was obviously paid close attention to by Konami. Fans of the Castlevania series will not be let down.  This is a true classic that every Playstation owner should have.", "Castlevania has been around since the original NES. we have played as countless belmonts, earned countless powerups, and destroyed draculas on countless occasions. Now the castle is back and to the rescue come Alucard, an acient vampire slayer with a shocking past. The castle is huge, the action is huge, and the enemies are huge!Throughout some of the more recent installments of castlevania there have been several different powers to acquire. whether those be magical cards, or the collection of souls, its been around. In this installment Alucard collects relics. These relics can do anything from allow you to jump twice in midair, to summon a ghost to help you in your battle through the castle. The relics are all nicely organized uin the pause menu, and are easily tuned on and off with the simple touch of a button.Another great addition to SOTN is the spells. You are able to buy magic scrolls from the merchant, which contain button combinations of how to perform different spells. Everything from health regeneration to summoning souls for a quick attack on the enemy, with ease! with this merchant comes my one and only gripe. In this game you only have the choice to sell of different gems, zircon, aquamarine, garnet, and so on. Toward the end of the game a relic which duplicates any item use becomes available, the only problem? its 500,000 dollars! seeign that the most valuable gem, the diamond, only pulls 20,000 bucks, it takes quite a logn time to find all the money for this item. I thought being able to sell off old, useless weapons, armor, and accesories would have helped this problem a long a bit better than simply wandering the castle for cash.In conclusion, it is impossible to talk about the plot of this game and not give anything away, so you will just have to play it. Take it from me, a person who has been collecting videogames for years and years, this game is going to attain a very high price tag in not very long. The original version can go for upward of 50 dollars, and ive even seen the greatest hit version for 40! Its a great expierience you won't be able to put down, great for the action/RPG junkie!", "The Good: Fast fun gameplay, nice graphical style, some of the best video game music ever created, long, good storyThe Bad: Extreme difficulty can really turn some people away, the age here shows quite a bitI never played this game before until now. I was too young at the time to really understand the game. Now that I've played it I understand why it got it's praise and I don't understand at the same time. What really makes me not like this game as much as other people is the extreme difficulty. Either that or I just suck at the game. I'm not really good at 2D platformers to begin with but this game does deliver on all accounts.It has a great story, great graphics, fast fun gameplay, you can equip stuff on every body part you have (ahem), you can buy things! While I'm not a huge Castlevania fan to begin with (first CV ever was Lament of Innocence (PS2). I'm not saying this game is terrible but for me the difficulty was way too hard for me. I just couldn't get past the third stage.", "This grows on, in, and around your consciousness.  Castlevania: SOTN is bliss, a heavenly escape from life.  Transcending mere fun, this game becomes a way of 10-hour life; maybe not so long, but one joyous ride.  Corny voice acting gives a lighthearted twist to the intended serious story, but that's hardly enough to detract from the uncut fun.  If you enjoy hybrids, I've counted these genres: platform, action, adventure, and RPG, one heady mix, and need nonstop action from your games, Castlevania should have long ago been yours.", "\"When people talk about the greatest game for the PSX most people will probably tell you Final Fantasy VII or something like that.  But I always think of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  By far this is the greatest 2D platformer to ever grace the gaming world, and there is no Castlevania better than Symphony of the Night.The game begins in 1792 with Richter Belmont going into battle with Dracula.  After Richter emerges victorious and banishes Dracula, the mysterious Castle disappears.  But a year afterwards Richter suddenly vanishes.  Maria, a close friend of his sets out to find him and out of nowhere Castlevania, the home of Dracula appears out of nowhere.You play as Alucard, the son of Dracula, who rushes into Castlevania when it appears in order to destroy it and prevent Dracula from returning.It's a very simple story, but its an action/adventure game.  The game also throws in some RPG elements.  Unlike the past Castlevania games, you're character now levels up and can equip weapons and armor.  Alucard also doesn't use the trademark whip like the Belmont's used to.  You actually use a Sword in one hand and you can even have a different weapon in another.  The game also presents a Super Metroid style map that you will use as you explore the castle looking for bosses to defeat and finding all of your abilities to take on Dracula.Like the classic games you've got \"\"Sub-weapons\"\" that use hearts.  Each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages.  For example, the throwing knives can be used for long range attacks but are fairly weak.  The Holy Cross does TONS of damage but cost a lot of hearts.You also have \"\"relics\"\" that you either find lying around or get from defeating bosses.  These relics help Alucard out and enhance his abilities.  You can use some relics to help you turn into a Wolf, turn into a bat or a cloud of mist. There is also a relic that lets you summon an ally known as a \"\"Familiar\"\" by your side.You can also use spells to hinder your skills.  The spells are done with a D-Pad combination.The visual look and feel of this game is astonishing.  A 2D game has never looked this good.  Even so many years later the graphics look really good.  Some are a tad bit fuzzy but you'll quickly get over that.The music is perhaps the best part about Castlevania: SOTN.  The tunes are addicting and you'll be humming them for a while.  The tunes were so good that I found myself just... standing around in one area just so I could enjoy the music.The game also throws in a twist halfway through.  Once you're done exploring the first castle you'll go to a \"\"Reverse\"\" castle in which everything is upside down.  The game also has four different endings.This is perhaps the best Playstation game of all time.  It is the best Castlevania hands down (with the excellent Circle of the Moon coming in second) and is the most breathtaking in the series.\"", "\"Quite frankly you are smoking rocks if this game doesn't become one of the most pleasantly infectious gaming memories of your life.  I should really hate this game for the hundreds of hours it has managed to detract me from doing things society would label as \"\"important\"\".  I love this game more than my mom and I've told that to her face.  Even if you don't end up liking this game I believe everybody owes it to themselves to try it out.With that said, this game is poetry in motion.  From the music to the artwork, everything is simply a pleasure for the senses and when coupled with solid simplistic and fun gameplay you really can't argue.The game has a sprite based watercolor feel to it and you aren't going to find an artistic direction like this in many other games because the lead character designer on this game, Ayami Kojima, is entirely self trained.  The art is perfect for this game though.  From the most obvious to the smallest detail you ARE in Dracula's castle.  Nothing feels out of place.  My only gripe here is that if you aren't playing the game on an overclocked Saturn then you're going to experience some lag when a lot is going on meaning that sometimes they were a little too ambitious with their work.The music sets the mood perfectly in this game.  I kind of like video game music from time to time, but I own this album and listen to it regularly.  The music can be serene and creepy for underground areas or drive powerful metal guitar riffs for those more intense moments.  Again, everything is paired perfectly (environments and music) and not a single area rubs you the wrong way.  There's also a hidden music track on this game if you put it in to a CD player which is kind of funny, so check it out.The gameplay, what's not to like here?  Taking everything cool about RPGs and pairing it flawlessly with everything good about action/platforming games.  The controls are solid, you can belt spells out Street Fighter style at a moments notice or backdash for dodging without thinking about it.  My only gripe is that the game can be super easy once you know what you're doing, but I really don't care because the game is such a joy to play.It's not necessarily obvious upon completing the game but there are TONS of replay modes and different endings to get.  You can play through with a different character, and several different sets of starting stats by entering a different name when you start the game.  There are also certain items, like the Duplicator, that are only available after you have cleared the game once.I could go on for days about the pleasures of this game but I've told you what you need to know.  With this game now being on the 360 arcade and supposedly coming out on the PSP there is no excuse not to play it.  I dream of the day when a true console sequel is made for this game with Guilty Gear Isuka quality graphics *DROOL*...\"", "Throughout Castlevanias history there have been only three thus far that did not follow the mainstream pattern.  Those were Castlvania 2 Simons Quest (NES) Castlevania Circle of the Moon (GBA) and Castlevania Symphony of the Night.  What seperated these three titles from the rest of the series?  They were Action RPG', not mainstream action games.Castlevania Symphony of the Night is the second approach at the RPG format.  This time however you are not a Belmont, instead the last one to this point (Richter) has mysteriously vanished around the same time that Castle Dracula has Re-emerged.  Maria goes in search of Richter and that's where you come in.You play Alucard, a half vampire half human.  Alucard was last seen fighing alongside Trevor Belmont, Grant DyNasty, and Sypha Belanade in Castlevania 3 the prequal to the first game (but not the earliest Belmont).  These three are somewhat resurected for a bossfight.  Alucard has reawaken to fight his father and put his cursed bloodline to rest.  after being stripped of his items early on you must explore Castle Dracula for clues as to what happened to Richter and put an end to Dracula.Graphically this game is a wonder.  Easily one of the best PSX games of all time (PSM rated this #3 for the top 50 PSX games).  It is (gasp) 2D, almost unheard of today.  In truth however that made this game even more fun and graphically amazing than before.However what truely stands out is the music.  Never has a Castlevania game had such outstanding music than this.  It is amazing and a wonder to own.In the end this is a definite keeper.  The only way not to like this is if you are either a devoted follower to 3D games, or don't like Castlevania.  Buy this now, I command you to.", "Exploration. Gothic Theme. Power-Ups. Great Music. Perfect Pacing. lots of Items. Huge variety of Enemies. Secret Areas. Well made puzzles.I really love the ambiance of this game. From the very start this world is just dripping with grit. The boss fights aren't too tough, but if you're like me you like feeling overpowered. Additionally, this game has several play modes. I don't want to spoil anything, but you can play as people other than Alucard. Or as a modified Alucard ;)MUST MUST MUST BUY! That is if you like Castlevania games...", "\"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night harkens back to the early and great Castlevanias of the old NES, but with vastly updated graphics, gameplay, and even ambiance.  Sure, it's still a 2-D scroller where you roam around and jump around on platforms and what not, but it's at the top of the heap.  The game starts somewhat oddly with you as a vampire hunter facing off against Dracula in a fairly wacky fight that always reminds me of a pro wrestling match.  You beat Dracula, at which point time warps ahead and you switch to Alucard, Dracula's remorseful son (spell Alucard backwards..yah, clever) who brings the fight to Dracula's vast and labyrinthe castle in an effort to do away with his evil sire for all time.  At first I was put off by what I thought was a bizarre and inelegant introduction (the human vampire hunter is a character from one of the mediocre middle Castlevania games, and is very unwieldy) but it turns out the manner in which you use him to defeat Dracula \"\"historically\"\" in the plot affects Alucard's starting abilities.  Meaning if you beat up on Drakula with magic, Alucard later favors magic.  Ditto for melee combat.Anyway, the game is lush and filled with endless amounts of loot.  Any monster has a chance to drop rare goodies when slain (based on Alucard's Luck stat), fake walls crumble to reveal hidden platemail, accidentally-tripped switches open bookcases or trapdoors, and zillions of types of monsters appear from all over the place.  The music is great and quite haunting, and the game's RPG and money system are quite well developed.  Alucard has quick \"\"combo\"\" spells you can use while fighting, and many of the weapons, shields, and armors he finds have their own effects which have to be discovered in game play.  I've located weapons that let Alucard teleport, summon the undead to fight for him, call lightning, ice, or fire, or even waves of holy light down on his foes.  Everything from helms to circlets to rings to boots can be worn, and Alucard eventually even develops the ability to transform into traditional vampire modes.  Dissipate into a swirling cloud of mist and waft through a ceiling vent to escape your enemies, turn into a wolf and charge through crowds of zombies, or transform into a bat and fly around breathing fire on everyone.  Lastly Alucard collects various magical relics throughout the game, that do everything from let him breathe underwater to have permament familiars that float around with him on screen and help him out (the dancing runesword is not to be missed).  As an example of the thought put into this game, your familiars themselves even gain experience and go up levels, growing both stronger and smarter over time.  For example, the runesword familiar at first just kinda floats along behind you, lethargically swinging at things long after they took a bite out of you.  But after a while it turns into a gleaming heat seeking weapon of vengeance, mercilessly smiting anything the second it shows up on screen.  At one point I turned Alucard into mist and just drifted around while the sword familiar took out a boss for me.  This game also has more items and secrets in it than your average Final Fantasy, and is more addictive.  It is also one of the least frustrating games you can find; you can save as often as you want in save rooms you find on your map (in a coffin, natch), heal yourself easily, and as a vampire you're more than a match for the sluggish beasts you meet early on.  The challenge of the game comes from an easy balance of combat and puzzle solving, rather than a heavy reliance on one or the other.Lastly, and most entertainingly, the bosses in this game are amazing.  Unlike earlier side scrollers where the game progressed through 'levels', in Symphony of the Night you simply roam around an enormous, maze-like castle.  You never know when suddenly a steel grate will drop behind you and you'll find yourself trapped in a fight with, oh, a grotesque giant mummy suspended on steel hooks that takes up 6 screens worth of animation.  That's just the sort of thing that's worth the price of admission.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0014299608301371336, 0.030148496851325035, 0.0728243961930275, 0.005402110982686281, 0.0964396744966507, 0.0015760756796225905, 0.003328594146296382, 0.035823121666908264, 0.09426280856132507, 0.04920261725783348, 0.009470081888139248, 0.021339192986488342, 0.0005370267317630351, 0.0006766545702703297, 0.03996405750513077, 0.052007075399160385, 0.09903278201818466, 0.04927996173501015, 0.0004909313283860683, 0.038023874163627625, 0.012687133625149727, 0.0036143469624221325, 0.0016436058795079589, 0.027233613654971123, 0.0005024471902288496, 0.10676157474517822, 0.020994320511817932, 0.0798109620809555, 0.04549247398972511]]}
