They put just as much effort into this second game as they did with the original. Once again, the game graphics are decent, the sounds are well done, the controls work well, and it has an interesting story. The latest patch is 1.01. It runs fine on my PC with Windows XP Home SP3. It's the kind of game that I would replay in the future.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections", "This game leaves you wanting more, in every missions there is more than one way to complete an objective.  Usually it's going in silent or just go in with guns raised and blasting.  Now when you first start the game it will take a little while to get used to the controls but that shouldn't take to long and besides it's worth the game play.  I bought this game about a week after it came out and I still play it.", "Not much difference in this game from the original. Had some difficulty with the controls, especially switching weapons... The original was a nightmare... Hitman 47 and IGI were both nightmares! I kept playing them until I couldn't stand it anymore...  The controls were terrible and I still see some problems with it in this game... The game is interesting and it's definitely fun to blow somebody away, but the controls are still a bit awkward... I'm on the fence with this one folks...You might find it a lot of fun and manage to work the controls better than me. EADOS needs to do some work on this game before it's really top notch... It has the makings of an excellent game with some deficiencies...primarily contols... The demo didn't allow me to save either, n'or did the first Hitman game. Like IGI, EADOS was supposed to have addressed that issue in the new game...", "I loved the first game. I am expecting a lot from hitman 2 the previews and screen shots of the game looks very promising. The preview said Hitman 2 will have limited saves for levels, much better interface and a first person option also. Cant wait to get Hitman 2.", "\"I played the first Hitman a lot. I liked its style and it did have some well-done aspects. However it did have some glaring mistakes that kept it from being a hit. Thankfully most of those have been done away with. And what was good before has been refined in to an even better game. If you did like Hitman, the sequel is much better. If you did not like Hitman, the sequel is much better.There are many things to like. The sound stands out in my mind. The weapons all sound good. Some I liked more than others just for their sound. And the music is top notch; a real symphony adds much more atmosphere than the usual video game background noise. The voice acting is good enough and is kept short and to the point.The graphics are good with some notable lighting and shading effects. The physics are also above average for a video game. The models vary in detail but are generally good. Lots of cool particle effects, from the lingering smoke of automatic weapon fire to the flash of a bullets smacking off metal pipes as well as some impressively gruesome blood spattering. But the many guns look great. They are highly detailed even out of first person mode. And the addition of a first person view is great since there are many indoor areas. While it is not the newest engine from Id, it can hold it's own.The AI on the other hand is a mixed bag. It is not too quick, but just smart enough to offer a challenge. While the enemies you will face are competent enough to detect you if you act suspicious they will not use much in the way of tactics. In one instance a few bad guys came running straight at me in a line down a corridor firing away. It was easy enough to now them down. It knows how to locate you and to shoot at you, that is about it. However when not going in Rambo style you can admire some of the more subtle aspects of the AI. Even when using a silenced gun a guard near by can still hear the bullet hitting the wall. If a civilian sees you do something suspicious he/she will run and find a guard, even tell them what you look like, who will then investigate the location of the disturbance. Yet after games like SOF2 and NOLF2 this AI fails to impress but it is still not bad.Of course the core of any game is the gameplay. Here Hitman2 uses what worked before and refined it. It also improves or drops what didn't work the last time. Stealth is still rewarding but not required. Hitman2 let's you set the pace, either to the beat of automatic weapons blazing away or the steady footsteps of a silent hunter. Usually you will end up in the middle. Either method works, and works better in some cases than others. While it's fun to whip out an Uzi and waste anyone standing in your way, I also enjoyed the professional hit by keeping my body count low. It's this dynamic with great sound and good graphics that make the game worth playing.Unfortunately I found some parts of the game less than impressive.  The story starts out strong with some great cut scenes, but drops off by the mid point of the game and really doesn't appear again until the final two missions. For the most part, it serves as a thin reason to send the player off to some exotic locations. But these locations do little or nothing to support the story. I can live with out a story to a game, just that his one started with one that seemed promising. Thinking of the later part of the game, I found the last few missions (before the final two) to be dull and tedious. There were not as good looking as the previous ones or as well designed. I got the impression that they were tacked on to fatten the game. They were not bad, just not as interesting and mostly repetitive.What my biggest complaint is that the map is still near worthless, making any real pre-planning pointless. I had to screw up a couple times each mission just to get a good feel for the layout of the level. An early mission has you knock off a Russian general and local crime boss in a public park. I decided the use a sniper rifle to take them out. I studied the map and saw a building marked radio tower. I thought a tower would be high enough to have a good view of the target. So I planned my way and it was going perfect until I got to the tower to find out that it had no line of sight at all with the target. Why couldn't this have been indicated on the map? In another mission I had planned an elaborate route to my target based off of what the map indicated were walled off alleys. Only when I got there I found out that I could get through some of them since some were not really blocked off. Yet the map leads me to think so. Other things like windows or where stairways lead are not clearly marked. I like thinking; I don't like guessing at what the map is telling me. It should be helpful, not confusing.Still the rest of the game is a great experience. Whatever flaws are quickly out done by the many strengths. If you are looking for a slick and stylish \"\"thinking shooter\"\" with an action movie quality, look no further.\"", "This game is fun. Generally you will progress through the levels with guns blazing. Sometimes you may stealth, but it is fun to run around with a double barrel shotgun and cause havoc. The thing that makes this stealth/action game fun is the fact that there are so many weapons. The music and sound effects add to it, but there are a LOT of weapons. I love the combat knife and anesthetic sneak ups.I just don't see a need to tell you about the graphics or the gameplay. The gameplay is good for stealth, but it is better for action. The plot is interesting as well, and I think the final level really brings it up nicely. Although the badguys may start to become annoying(there are quite a few), you will learn their names with time. Anyways, this game is pretty good and should not be overlooked. 5 stars"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.20717035233974457, 0.10172740370035172, 0.18045227229595184, 0.0683860331773758, 0.24114419519901276, 0.2011197805404663]]}
