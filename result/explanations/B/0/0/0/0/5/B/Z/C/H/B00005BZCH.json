This game is a popular series that has --until this point-- been very enjoyable. But Treyarch has seriously lost their touch. Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game, the ability to visit street level and foil \"\"everyday crimes\"\" around the city is awesome. But the \"\"level bosses\"\" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game. This game deserves no honors whatsoever, since the designers spent too much time trying to do \"\"cool\"\" things, rather than making it playable. Go back to the older Spiderman games and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more.\"", "\"They say if it ain't broke, then don't fix it. I loved the first Spider-Man game. The graphics were crisp and detailed, the story was deep and involving, and the controls were precise and tight. Then Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, which completely re-wrote the video game genre. Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula: Free roaming cities, mini-missions, mayhem and violence, etc. Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results.I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below. Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented, the latter is dull and repititious. Like GTA, there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Whenever there is trouble, a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place. Unfortunately, there is a lack of variety in these missions. You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away, take an injured civilian to the hospital, catch a civilian from falling to his or her death, or save people from a sinking boat. After a few of these, you'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story. Solving these missions contribute to your \"\"Hero Points\"\" which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store. Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos? Strange...Unfortunately, due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game, the graphics are the first to suffer. In most instances, the game resembled a Playstation 1 game. Spidey generally looks good, but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes. I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly, Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game.Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel. Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat, the gameplay and graphics truly suffer. This one is definately a rental.\"", "This game is incredibly beautifully made. The graphics, the physics, the freedom... they are truly amazing.  The horizon of graphic is pretty far, there are many interesting things to explore.But... other than being gorgeous, the game simply lacks gameplay.The missions are all very easy. The enemies are all very easy and the gameplay must have been geared to a younger group of players than me (I'm on my early 20s). The only true enemy of Spiderman in this game is water.  All the fights are easy, Rhino, and all of them... just fall very easily (and there aren't even that many of the more special enemies that try to make it challenging).  The only truly difficult parts of the game are the ones that involve water, the duel over the statue of liberty and the final battle against Dr Ock both involve the constant risk of falling on water and since that kills you at once it is the only true challenge in the game.  I find that annoying and frankly a bit old.The side quests such as finding sckyscraper special locations and stuff are a good idea (reminds me of Grand Theft Auto), but frankly there is no payoff. You find all of them and all you get is a medal on your status screen saying you did it.  Who cares? There are so many things that could have been added such as different costumes for Spidey, changes to Peter's apt, and etc. (Again, similar things have been done before for example in GTA).The random missions are very repetitive (by the 8-9 time a armored car was being robbed it got to be pretty boring).The game still is pretty funny though, the voices are made by the actors from the movie so they are great.I just wish they had spent some of the time they used making the amazing NY in the game creating some more story and gameplay instead.The 9/11 memorial in the game was a pretty neat and sensitive inclusion though.", "THE SHORT: Go anywhere anytime in a full version of Manhattan.  Crawl buildings or swing all day, stop random crimes or take on the story.  Similar not to GTA but True Crime, but too unique for direct comparison.  Not as horribly difficult or badly acted as I've read, but it could use more variety in some areas.THE LONG: When I was first debating buying this game, I kept seeing comparisons to Grand Theft Auto. I will immediately tell you this is misleading. You don't steal cars, you can't beat up civilians, and there's no big series of missions to take from different people. It has a couple similar elements to GTA, but in fact the game plays more like True Crime. Like in that game, you can co anywhere at any time, your missions revolve around random street crimes, and aside from a main storyline the bulk of the game's fun is coming from exploring and building up your records. This isn't to say Spider Man 2 isn't fun on its own, because it is. And it's different enough from most other games to really stand out.The game starts you off as Spidey and guides you through a brief but helpful and humorous tutorial delivered by none other than the man, Bruce Campbell himself. After that, it's up to you.  Swing from the rooftops, stop random crime, help citizens in distress, or take on the main storyline. It's all fun, thanks to the great graphics and controls. The game's gravity and speed system gives you a very proper sense of weight and control over Spiderman, and it's a definite blast to just zip around through the rather large city.Fight controls are, in my opinion, good as well. Like a true comic book hero, Spidey does all kinds of goofy leaps and flips mixed in with the fisticuffs. You can literally run and knock an opponent fifteen feet into the air, jump up and kick him down, then throw a web to catch him before you land and throw him against the side of the building. It's wild, and although you can simply beat guys up with one button, the joy is in all the different flourishes and moves you can execute.  And after seeing the films again last week, I was surprised by just how many specific moves they took from the movie for inclusion into the game. Still, there's also a sick humor in just grabbing a mugger, webbing up to the top of the Empire State Building, and hurling him off. Yes, the game lets you do this. And yeah, it's fun.The random and distress crimes are fun enough as well, but their downside is that, like True Crime, they boil down to the same core missions when it's all stripped down. It doesn't matter if the enemies are robbing a bank or stealing a purse, it'll still come down to you chasing down the baddies and beatin' em down.  There's some variation that involves Spidey's particular skills like rescuing hanging construction workers and people from sinking boats, but after a while the crime stuff does get repetitive. In all honesty I didn't have a problem with it until a good week after playing (and finishing) the game, but some will tire more quickly of the lack of variety in the actual objectives.Which leaves the storyline, which can pretty much be followed at your own pace (although most of Spidey's coolest moves will be unlocked this way). The actual story mode follows the general course of the movie but throws in much substance and characters for filler, and can probably be beaten in about a dozen hours for a casual player. Some, like EGM magazine, have made the boss battles seem ridiculously impossible, but I hardly had a problem with any of it. The toughest spot for me was a sort of obstacle course I was forced to participate in pretty early on, but this type of story mission occurred only once, and the rest to me was just fine. The voice acting was perfectly adequate as well, with no one sounding particularly worse or better than they sounded in the films (again, EGM's review notwithstanding). The same can't be said for the citizens though, who sound quite dumb, but in a fun, somehwat conscious way.But if all the rest of this stuff doesn't grab you, there's still loads of optional goals to complete. There are literally hundreds of icons to collect in the city, as well as races to try to win and small secrets to uncover (minor spoiler: don't expect too much other than pride if you expect to collect all the green info tokens. This is one of the more wiseguy jokes I've seen in a game, and you'll either laugh or cry after all that work. So heads up).In my honest opinion, Spider Man 2 is a hell of a game. It's just plain fun to rush around the city while web slinging, crawl to the tops of skyscrapers and swan dive off, and beat up countless thugs with crazy moves. I put in about 50 hours, and a lot of that has been spent just exploring and collecting.  It's good enough in the substance that it borrows from True Crime, and it's unique and well made enough on its own to really stand out. I really enjoyed it.", "Top line: great game and the best Spider Man game ever!Environment: 10 out of 10. Manhattan is perfectly recreated. People walk by chatting and yelling stuff like &quot;Go Spidey!&quot; when you pull off something cool, or &quot;Menace!&quot; when you swing over their head. Cars move around and you can surf on top of them.Kids will lose balloons, and you can deliver them back to them... thiefs will attempt bank robberies, ships will sink... and you can have your say in setting things right.Graphics: 8 out of 10. While the city is perfect, characters are sort of weak. In up-close shots, you will notice how people look like a ballon with a human skin attached to it.Physics: 10 out of 10. GREAT STUFF! The best part of the game is just swinging around... its so cool you will almost get dizzy on it. Moreover, you can pull-off some style combos while flying around and this will get you energy back and make you have even more fun. Its like having an SSX3 game put into a super hero game.Plot: 7 out of 10. The game follows squarely the movie, adding however a bunch of side quests. Side quests do get sort of weak after a while, though.The Bottom Line:This is truly a well done game! Buy it if:1) you are by any means a comic fan or a Spidey fan.2) if you saw and enjoyed the movie.3) if you like action games with awesome physics!", "Didnt let me down. im a spider fan myself. when i played the first one i didnt like it at all. the controls where all goofy and the story was all jack'd up. i didnt want to play it again. but after see'n spiderman 2 i went out and bought the game. after a few minutes of playing i was hook'd. this is way better then any other superhero game ever made. you get to perform all of spider man moves from the movie as well as a few that was off screen. the story line is very good. it doesnt drift of or anything. the side missions are very fun. the boss battles dont disappoint either. there are tons of unlockables, even after you beat it you still have stuff to unlock. i still play this game today. its has a very high replay value. you will not be disappointed.", "\"I bought the game yesterday (July 3), and I have been playing it ever since.  It is GTA (without carjacking) meets THUG (without skateboarding) meets the Spider-Man comic book.  This game is amazingly fun to play, if you're playing the missions, or just taking a \"\"Spidey\"\" tour of The Big Apple.  This game does not stick to the storyline, it adds characters in, such as Mysterio, Shocker, and Black Cat.  It does use the storyline of the movie as a plotline basis, though.  The one problem that I have with this game, however is the graphics.  I feel that they can be much better than they already are, but in a game as fun as this, who cares?\"", "\"I love the way you can go anywhere in this game .But the mini missions are repetative.graphicaly this game is not so bad, but I have a \"\"S\"\" video cable for my XBOX ,which improves resolution. That is if you have a compatable TV. I think some younger kids might like this game better. All in all a good concept game but could've been better. Like More diverse side missions .And maybe you could talk to people on the street instead of the same cutscenes in the mini missions. This game is fun to swing around the city and see the day change into night with all the city lights is pretty kool.It'd be nice to play some of the other characters too.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.19953787326812744, 0.19125230610370636, 0.07330116629600525, 0.018464434891939163, 0.27114659547805786, 0.015514986589550972, 0.0036645974032580853, 0.12080105394124985, 0.10631702095270157]]}
