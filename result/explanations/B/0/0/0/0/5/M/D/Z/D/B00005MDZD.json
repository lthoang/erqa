With even high quality S Video/Red and whites (oxygen free wrapped too no less) my ps2 on my samsung high def screen looked Terrible. I could barely read the text on the screen, the colors were muted, and overall the picture was muddy.I bought these cables hoping to correct the issue, and they worked beautifully. The PS2 now looks better than it ever did which is great for when I start getting retro game cravings. I don't know yet what I'm going to do about some of my other older consoles (other than continually buy game collections for my 360 and PS2?) but this was a much needed, and much appreciated product.Just plug them in, and you're off to the races. Double check to make sure you're setup for component cables in the systems configuration. (mine changed automatically)The monitor is only a couple of years old. So these cables WILL work (despite misinformed reviews to the contrary) on newer monitors.Ace Combat 5 went from muddy with nigh unreadable text to very sharp, very clear overall picture quality and perfect text clarity. I'll be testing some of my other games later.But these cables are easily worth the money spent.", "\"First, I have a newer model Proscan LCD flatscreen and I believe the component inputs are of the type that are not supposed to work with this cable.  But as others have noted, they DO work.  At first I thought that this would not work because I was getting a staticy, intermittent signal.  I notified the seller, who sent a replacement cable, which works fine.  I did have to raise the PS2 off the top of our VCR (yes, we still have one) because there was some interference that was causing the picture some issues.  I just put a couple of small wooden blocks under the Ps2 and now it's fine.So, do these cables make a difference?  Yes, and it's worth the minimal investment to me.  If you don't tend to notice such things, then it might not be worth it to you, but text and subtle details are smoother and more defined.  To my eye it's a substantial improvement, but \"\"substantial\"\" only because I was never pleased with the way the Ps2 looked on the flatscreen.  I'd noticed a similar improvement by hooking our Wii up with component cables, and so gave this a try, and I'm glad I did.I followed the suggestions of others in these reviews:  1. changed output on the Ps2 to component from RGB, 2. turned off Ps2, 3. changed cable, 4. turned Ps2 back on and switched to appropriate input on the tv and voila - improved Ps2 visuals.I also have to give kudos to the seller, who replaced my cable immediately without questions.  That kind of customer service for such a low-cost product is hard to find.\"", "This was an excellent deal. The cable came quickly and in perfect condition, and works still to this day. I currently have it plugged into an HDTV and the picture is great for an old PS2. Definitely get this if it's what your looking for!", "\"I tried my old fatty ps2 with composite on my 46\"\" Samsung lcd and it looked terrible. So blurry and pretty much unplayable. Burnout 3 takedown was really atrocious especially with all the speed. I ordered this component a/v cable and I am shocked on how it looks so amazing now. Burnout 3 takedown which was unplayable with composite... now it looks amazing with component. Bright, crisp images even with super speed of the game. Burnout 3 does 480p and does 16:9 so it looked really nice. Tekken 5 is another great looking game on hdtv that does 480p and 16:9. Tried 6 games and I was very impressed with picture quality. I may just buy some old cheap ps2 games now. I am using large 46\"\" lcd so I would think the ps2 with component would look even more crisper on a smaller 32-40\"\" hdtv screen. Now I can chuck out my tube TV and composite a/v cable. Some people say that it doesn't work with y/pb/pr?! Hmmm... Well, this does work with Y/Pb/Pr on my Samsung lcd.Everybody with a ps2 should definitely use component a/v cable with their HDTV.... Huge difference compared to composite a/v cable.\"", "they do make the picture better but i got them to record gameplay on my Roxio HD capture and it works perctly", "\"Purchased these cables despite the negative reviews saying that they will not work on newer televisions.  I just have to say that I have a 42\"\" Panasonic Veira LED with a modded PS2 (HDD added) and these cables are shockingly better than the regular RGB cables.  So, they definitely do not have problems with all new televisions since mine is well under 2 years old, a newer technology being an LED television, and they work very well.All I did was set the PS2 to component settings in the setup, then plugged the cables in and everything worked perfectly.  I was actually surprised how much better things looked.  I tested it out on Bully since that game is one of the worst looking on my television.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear, well as clear as they can be on a 10 year old console.Moral of the story, $5 is worth the risk.  If they don't work then bummer, you're out $5 if you decide not to return them and it goes back to the way it was before you tried the cables.\"", "These were a replacement for the original cables that I had for the PS2 when I originally bought it. I wasn't looking for a better quality, just for something that worked. It was a pleasant bonus to get an improved picture when I used them. Definitely worth it for $5 shipped.", "Stopped working after about 6 months.How do A/V cables stop working when you plug them in and dont touch them?!? I can understand them wearing out if their being plugged in and unplugged constantly,but to just stop working? Cheap .99 cent store quality.I guess you get what you pay for.", "Doesn't work for Y Pb Pr TVs like the other reviewer mentioned. My TV is new from 2009, I don't know why they wouldn't make compatible cables for recent TVs!! It shows the Playstation logo on the screen and then the picture freezes. Not recommended", "i needed bettr comp cables 4my ps2&snatched up these cheapys for few $$$$!very good build quality for no real $$$?!&they work rlly good too!nice thick cable.i tried to squeeze em&they hold up rlly well!glad i got these because standard def rca/looks HORRIBLE on an Hdtv!omg yucky-picture....still crank up my old 2001 model ps2!works like just received as a gift!cables can make all the diff.D&H is a good company/thank u guys&keep up the good work", "But its a given with the ps2 when playing on a HDtv. But there are exceptions the top game you expect to have good visuals do look good in hd somewhat. Not sure if its worth it but its up to you if you want  to play your ps2 games with slight boost in color clarity. But most if not some of the graphical flaws will stick out especially older games.", "What can I say, I'm happy about this a/v cable. I was somehow missing my old cable, just wanted to play a PS2 game for some reason.
