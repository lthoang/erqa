The game was made by Capcom, but distributed by Squaresoft, and anything by Square had to be good, right?Anyway, the game itself was fun, if standard. You control Ryu as he and his merry band of adventurers attempt to defeat an evil dragon (whose name escapes me now, I am sorry to say). Of course, the story spirals from here, and you are caught up in a plot by a goddess to rule the world. By today's standards, it may seem trite, but there are many bonuses (for example, how many games let you fish?). Your characters (eight or nine in total) each have special abilities, allowing you to open secret areas, which adds to the replay value. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I think it has been seven or eight years since I played it. However, I am sure that the Advance version will have new bonuses, so needless to say, I'll be killing a few MORE hours with this game. I think it is worth checking out...", "I first played Breath of Fire 10 years ago, back when the SNES was all the rage, and I am reminded of how much fun it was. Though it was not as good as the Final Fantasy games, it is a decent RPG. I am glad I have it again, since the SNES cart is a rare find these days.The original 16-bit graphics and music have been restored, making the game feel very retro. This is a major plus for me, because I cannot imagine Playstation quality graphics on such a tiny system. Every element of the original is here: the battle system, the characters, the secrets, and the stories. The story is typical RPG standard, which now seems cliched since all the similar RPGs have come out on the PSX. But I always say that the originals are the best, and I am not wrong in this case.The only real drawback to this version is the often fuzzy sound, which can be quite annoying. The editorial review mentioned that the sound is a bit tinny, but I found it more fuzzy. Maybe it is just a problem with my GBA, but I haven't noticed it on any other game.BOF is a nastalgia trip for me, and will prove just as good for first time players. It is one of the classic RPGs, and one I recommend getting before it becomes rare like the older versions.", "Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: T.R.C.Breath of Fire by Capcom for the Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Micro and Nintendo DS. This is yet another port from the SNES to the GBA system. Breath of fire is one of the lesser-known RPG's that turned out to be really good.You start out as a young teen and your town is under attack from the DARK dragons.Your older sister sacrifices herself to save you and the town. Thus starts your quest for revenge. You meet up with a Princess, a Thief, a Bad Merchant, a Wolfen-Hunter, a Mole person, the Brute Ox, and a Sorceress. All of them have talents you will need to get your revenge. Be prepared for a 20 hour-long quest.Graphics 7/10 - For a GBA based game the graphics are good. There are some movie-like full motion videos.Music 5/10 - Same as the SNES version, Capcom could have updated it.Gameplay 9/10 - Fun and addictive, some of the mini-games like fishing, digging, and hunting were lots of fun.Battle System 6/10 - The same turn based system we all know and love, with the addition of being able to turn into a dragon and morph into a mix of the people on your team. The magic system is earned in levels and by finding the spells.Overall 7/10 - The game was fun and kept me entertained until the very end.My only complaint is that they could have updated the story and the music a bit. Burn Baby Burn!", "My first recollection of Breath of fire came with Breath of Fire 2 for the SNES. While I admit, it was an awesome game in its own right. I was anxious to round up the original for it. But, alas, I wasn't able to. Now, with the Gameboy Advance, I finally get the chance to check out the Classic. So, what can I tell you about Breath of Fire for the Gameboy Advance....Well, it's been an absolute blast to play. I hadn't been able to put it down since I got it for Christmas. I've even brought it to work with me a time or two to play. Graphically, it's very colorful and animated. There's alot of exploration, and things to do in the game. Hundreds of spells to do battle with and battles galore. You can even exchange items with your GBA link cable. For a classic RPG, I highly recommend it to all.Given it's not Final Fantasy but it's just as good. If not better in some respects. It's definately worth the price of admission.Do yourself a favor and check it out.", "\"One of my biggest dissapointments ever. Now I have never played the playstation version, so I can not compare the two, but this game was horrible.You start out in a small town, its being attacked by some evil family. So some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die, then she attacks this guy. All of a sudden your back in the huge building, and some guy says go on a quest. So you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are, except you are part of the dragon clan. You go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle. Now the king tells you \"\"You are awesome!\"\", and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes. Not only was this task stupid, I do not even know why I did it, because I got no reward. Also, couldn't the king have sent his men to clear out the castle? So you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards. Keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game. You kill a knight and turn off the quake control. Now you go back to the king and he says \"\"You rock again! I am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero, now leave!\"\". Then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill. So you play as Nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard. How did they know the wizard had a remedy? Then you get sent to help Nina kill him. Back at the castle, the king gets up and Nina says \"\"I am going with Ryu because I need to stop evil in the world\"\". So then you leave. Notice you have done 3 quests and got nothing but Nina.Not only do you have no info about who you are, you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end. I am still not sure anyone knows my name. This game is overrated. Also, there are too many random battles. You cannot walk 10 steps withouht having to fight some weak monster. Now if you want an RPG on the game boy advance, get Golden Sun. If you want an RPG that serves no purpose and seems like people made up as they created it, get Breath of Fire.\"", "Here is another classic game that i somehow missed. People who complain that this game has outdated graphics or sound dont really seem to understand that  this was a SNES game & the start of the new series.  Very few ports gets a graphic upgrade but playing this game on the DS will make this game look great.  Anyways this game gave me alot of entertainment.  I would get stuck in various places not knowing where to go & even though the save points were pretty rare in this game they were available.  I never had a problem with the saving in this game & i think with some of the newer games they tend to have too many save points.  Overall i think this is a great game & a true RPG like Final Fantasy.", "Shaken by the lack of excitement or engrossment upon PS1's Breath of Fire III, I shook my head in disgrace, feeling betrayed by a series in which I held in such appreciation.  A full fledged Fantasy reader by that time, the lackluster and insipid dialogue dragged me far, far away from Capcom's RPG.  But its not to say I was never a fan.  I was.  And, if extrapolations are accurate, BoF V will come out bursting in noble bearing and reestablish my fanhood.  I am though, very fond of the first two BoF games.  Both games, early drafts of the future fabrication of traditional RPGs, had an excuse to have unsavory dialogue of today's gut-wrenching standards.  Anyway, back in the day, BoF was an underrated landmark of RPG greatness.  Vaguely recalling how I lost my copy for the SNES (I think it revolved around a starving kid and one of his favorite RPGs), I felt compelled to revisit the game on the GBA.  Borrowing it from a friend, then stuffing my flabby butt on a warm, cozy couch, reasons why I was so intrigued with BoF slowly seeded and came into palpable emergence.Square originally published the game, hence the word PUBLISH.  They did not get their hands in the grim and take part in the actual production. Capcom did.  In their effort, they shaped something entirely new and unsuspectingly praiseworthy.  Unlike most plot-driven RPGs, an RPG to have a story woven around dragons is enormously sporadic.  Personally embracing a scenario set in the combat of dragons, I found myself coaxed and immersed into a nifty plot.The tale picks up when Ryu, a dragon disguised as a blue-hair human, sets out to envelop vengeance on the wicked Dark Dragon Clan.  Leaving Ryu's home village in ashes, the Dark Dragon Clan then focuses their sights on freeing Tyr, the female apocalypse.  Ryu, ordained by his higher ranks, must prevent this with his personal score to settle.  On his lengthy journey, he enlists the aid of a few comrades, and ultimately helps them resolve their sticky origins.  What struck me most about BoF was the balls Capcom had.  They presented some of the most oddball characters ever made.  Characters like Gobi (a Fish-man), Bo (a Wolf-man), and the Mogu (a Mole-man) wouldn't have been so well received in today's grueling critiques.  Nevertheless, the likable cast is quite a departure to be had.Gameplay-wise, the traditional RPG menu of Fight, Magic, Item, and Defend are faithfully intact.  BoF is  your customary fantasy quest with all the stereotypical dungeons and environments to delve into.  What truly set BoF apart form Traditional RPG counterparts though, is Ryu's ability to morph into a number of mighty dragons.  Each dragon had its magical property, cladding the game in sorts of strategic value.  All throughout the vast lands, Dragon Shines were found.  When Ryu entered one, he and he alone proceeded in a  backbreaking duel with another dragon to gain its type.  Gratifying the challenge appetite, those shrine battles were  particularly unforgiving, but with time and re-evaluating the line of attacks, success reeled in.Outside the shelter of friendly towns, the game is played in a 2D overview and the party usually went to explore dungeons and what not.  Each character had a special skill not directly found in combat but in discovering pathways, those are Ox who demolishes walls and  Mogu who dug passageways underground.  Together with all the trappings of an old-school RPG, BoF has some addictive minigames.Bo is a professional when it came to his use of bow and arrow, and he snapped the bowstring when animals were found moving on screen.  The hides of animals are traded in towns for several items.  But of all the minigames, Ryu's ability to fish was awkwardly addicting.  Nicely executed, BoF on the GBA identically matches the SNES experience.On its presentation, the graphics on the GBA are nearly indistinguishable as the original.  The only exceptions are the upgraded view of vibrancy.  Not flamed with glamour like Golden Sun, BoF is as simple as colorful pixel art.  Hey, with its fluid sprite animation and additions of new face portraits, I have no latent quibble.  The tunes are swell, stuffed in the right moments and keeps a hale and hearty overall feel.  Besides, the discharging world music is godsend, briefly hypnotizing me back into what I haven't played in ages.For the most part, BoF employed and triggered old SNES nostalgia.  Grateful of the GBA port, I propose RPG fans to take a look.  If and only if your expectations are sky-high in a game's design, and if you do have a copy of Breath of Fire with a healthy SNES, I wouldn't go as far as to purchase it, because the enhancements are minimal.  Replete with all the trimmings of a lustrous old-school combination of sorts, BoF is a whipping combination of blueprints on how Traditional RPGs came to be.  Even in a new era of gaming and the lack of fancy-schmancy graphics, I hope never to return this enjoyable cartridge to my pal, because friends are for the taking and this little gem is already lodged along the likes of Golden Sun and portable Zelda greats.", "Final Fantasy aside, Breath of Fire is one of the longest-running RPG series around, and the handheld version of the first adventure gets decent treatment. Yet despite the re-appearance of the game's fresh visuals and unique play aspects, the lifeless narrative doesn't provide the immersive experience that you'd expect. Originally released by Square on the Super NES in 1994, Breath of Fire arrives on the Game Boy Advance with enhanced cinemas, but otherwise remains unchanged. You play as Ryu, a lone hero who can also transform into a variety of powerful dragons. During the course of Ryu's quest, various characters join your party, each with their own personal demons and diversions that involve the entire team. An RPG's lifeblood is a strong story, but BoF's narrative is remarkably uninvolving. You'll spend a lot of time engaging in mundane tasks-&quot;talk to A, then B, then A again, and then C&quot;-and navigating a series of seemingly endless mazes. Even the turn-based battles lack flair, except for the boss battles. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with this one, but a new Dash feature speeds you through the game and saves batteries. BoF delivers a tight visual and audio package. Colorful sprites fill the screen with arresting colors and special effects, while the soundtrack provides decent music accompanied by muted sound effects. Workmanlike controls feature easy menu navigation and responsive character movement. On the whole, Breath of Fire is an enjoyable RPG that easily kills spare time. Just don't expect a thoroughly involving adventure on the same level as later games in the series.", "\"The original Breath of Fire! You start out as \"\"Ryu\"\", one of the villagers of a dragon clan that is being attacked. A very short time in the beginning of the game you don't do much, otherwise than moving around. It'll then follow the scene where your character is frozen but soon afterward you'll be able to continue on.Pro's:-\"\"Animated\"\" Turn-base fighting, the characters don't just \"\"stand\"\" then \"\"move foward\"\" then do an attack. The graphics are designed where they actually \"\"move\"\" while their idle/fighting, and react to being hit. Which was pretty cool seeing that most of the TB games back there were just \"\"standing around\"\".-\"\"Nina\"\" seems like the smaller version of the \"\"grown-up-nina\"\" in BOF2-Minigames such as fishing are fun in their origin.-Different characters to add to your party.Con's:-Gameplay is dated along with graphics-SNES direct port-Music is dated-Random Battles-Be prepared to walk around alot-May seem \"\"short\"\" by today's standardsBreath of Fire is the start of the original series. Although not as good as it's second installment (BOF) it is still a cool game to add to any oldschool gamer's collection.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0017064260318875313, 0.22894719243049622, 0.007688560523092747, 0.006701258476823568, 0.21016813814640045, 0.1285594254732132, 0.021779872477054596, 0.22432558238506317, 0.17012356221675873]]}
