Nintendo has really gone downhill since this system but they have brought themselves back up again with the Nintendo DS. This has pretty good graphics but PlayStation 2's and Xbox's graphics are way better. Some things I really like about this console is that it is very small. It even has a handle which is very easy for carrying. The fan is really nice too. This is one of the only systems that doesn't overheat if you leave it on for a day or so. The controllers are okay and pretty comfortable and they are pretty cheap now. The Wavebird is really cool because Nintendo makes it and PlayStation 2 and Xbox have wireless controllers but they are made by wierd providers.

After all, there are now three major consoles on the market, each boasting its advantages.  In the end, however, I stuck with my old and stalwart friend, Nintendo.  Ever since the days of my original Nintendo system back in the mid 80s, I have frittered away countless precious hours of my life to playing games, games, and more games.  I hoped the Gamecube would live up to the standard of its predecessors, and I was not disappointed.To me, one thing matters more than graphics, sound, etc.  That thing is gameplay.  And, for a variety of utterly enjoyable and very playable games, its hard to beat Nintendo.  My friend has a PS2, but since I got my Gamecube I find we haven't used it much.  The Gamecube is great because it contains such classic series as the Mario series, Zelda, Starfox, and one which recently returned to the forefront--Metroid.  All in all, I absolutely love Nintendo's games, and find myself much more entertained with the games available on this system than those on the PS2 or the Xbox.To me, this is the best system out there.  It's also the cheapest.  If you're struggling with the decision of which console to pick, I highly recommend the Gamecube.", "Looks the new plays great I love it . I even got an extra controller and memory card  free . Nice suprise  . I think the cube is under rated .", "The Nintendo Gamecube came out around 11/10-19/01 and from it's begining to this very day, it is considered as a child's system. They're partially right: About 60% of the videogames coming out are Teen & Mature rated,& only a fraction of them ever reach the 'cube (restating the fact that this is for mostly kids.)The console does pass at an 80% though. The graphics on Nintendo's latest console are better than ever, but Sony & Microsoft are still in the lead. The design of the Gamecube is.... well, a cube (duh). Compared with the PS2 and Xbox, it's the most compact of them all(mabey not the slim PS2), so you can set it up almost anywhere. If you're a die-hard Nintendo freak, then this for you.Anyone else may lose interest very quickly and buy another, different console, but keep reading.As I said in the begining, the graphics could be improved, but  about 100 of the games have stellar graphics.The controller, in my opinion, is the most comfortable for your hands than the other big-boy consoles. It dosen't have a kajillion buttons like it's underling, the N64.Also it is smaller than Xbox's mammoth controller. It sports 4 buttons, 3 shoulders, a joystick, control pad, and a camara changing c-stick.The games are mostly 1st party games(games made by their console company) with some big name multi-console games. Nintendo sticks to it's roots with its original titles, like Mario(mostly for kids), Donky Kong(party game/kid game), which uses bongos instead of a controller, Metroid(for teens and adults), and my favorite: The Legend of Zelda(for kids and teens and adults). Then some other games like Resident Evil 4, the NBA live series, and Prince of Persia.I'd say try the cube at a friends house, if you like it, buy it, or try the other consoles, you will find one you like. If you thinking of getting this one, here are some recomindations, you'll be satisfied: Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario 2, Metroid Prime 1&2, Zelda Wind Waker & Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, Prince of Persia, and Super Smash Bros. Meele.Look for Nintendo's next Revolution.1up.com forever!", "\"When I first saw the Cube, sure, I was a little confused with the look. Yeah, I'm a little shallow too. I'm only human. But the first time I picked up the controller and played a demo, I was sold and half.The controller really is the perfect shape and size to fit the average human hand. It takes the general design of the PSX and PS2 controller and streamlines it to do away with any awkwardness inherent in the design. Shigeru Miyamoto himself spent considerable time working on the controller design to perfect it, and it really shows. There is absolutely not controller, first- or third-party made that feels better and can be used longer.The system is incredible. Nintendo has decided not to try to split power between DVD and CD playing, and focus purely on gameplay. And that's a good thing. This is the machine of a blue-blooded gamer, someone who only cares about the love of the game, not number of the widgets. The built in fan keeps the system cool for literally hours. Unlike the XBOX, which was shipped in 2001 without a cooling fan, the Cube can be left on for hours at a time with not skip or melt or shutdown. In addition, unlike the crashing experienced too often on the XBOX, the majority of GC's won't crash during their lifetime. Add to that the most durable shell ever seen on any console, and you have a hell of a well-put-together system.The medium, additionally, is, according to third party publishers, the easiest to use. And it more than does its job, as attested to in its fantastic library. Nintendo has always tried to make titles for all ages, and on the Cube it has succeeded:Eternal Darkness (rated M)Resident Evil (M)Resident Evil 0 (M)Zelda: The Wind Waker (E)Rogue Leader (T)F-Zero GX (T)Resident Evil 4 (M)Animal Crossing (E)Pikmin (E)Metroid Prime (T)Super Mario Sunshine (E)Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (M)The list goes on, but you get the point. The GC has the largest library of AAA first party titles of any system. . . well, ever. Far from being a \"\"kiddie machine,\"\" the Gamecube manages a wide range of variety meets quality.Now, many people would complain about the lack of online support for the GC. I'm not one of them. I have a computer, thank you very much, and that meets my online gaming needs just fine. I don't need to go to the net on my Cube to be happy with my system.And that's what it gets down to. The GC has seen more play time in my house than any other system. It's just the fact that the games on the system are fun. With PS2 and XBOX, I find myself waiting for the next Halo, Metal Gear Solid, or Grand Theft Auto, with little to no must-haves in between. However, with multiple branches of Nintendo working on its different franchises, along with it farming off some to third-party publishers, the games I love are flowing more freely on the Cube than any other system.All in all, this system, especially considering the recent price drop, is well worth the purchase, and with a solid line-up on the 2004 horizon, there has never been a better time.\"", "Well, I am a self-proclaimed Nintendo fanatic and could never pass up a new gaming machine from them, but how can anyone pass up on such a cool videogame system?  There are tons of amazing games to attract a multitude of gaming tastes. Everything from simple games for kids to role playing games, action adventure, sports and first person shooters. Add into that mix the unsurpassed franchises Nintendo supports that rarely fail to rock the videogaming industry to it's foundation and you've got a system that has appeal to all gamers.But Nintendo doesn't stop there. With this gaming machine you can add adapters for online play (broadband or dial up) and connect your Game Boy Advance (GBA) to it for trading gaming information between the two devices, opening up hidden ares and expanding your gaming experience. Soon, you'll even be able to play your GBA games on your TV through your GameCube with the Game Boy Player!The Nintendo GameCube is quite simply a gaming powerhouse!  Expanding our ideas of what videogames can do and where they can take us.  It's designed from the ground up to take us into the next level of gaming.  Join the fun! Don't miss the ride of a lifetime!", "\"As all of you know this console is produced by Nintendo, a pure gaming company with an extremly rich history. Nintendo has been in the industry so long that many of us grew up with a Nintendo console in the home. Nintendo revolutioniized the gamin industry with the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 1980's. Bottom line Nintendo has been producing games and consoles for over 20 years and they are the seasoned vetrans of the gaming world. You can't go wrong with a company like that.Nintendo released the Gamecube in November of 2001, thats two years ago to this date. Since then sales of the \"\"Cube\"\" as some call it, or \"\"GC\"\", have fallen like a boulder. However in September 2003, Nintendo announced that they would reduce the price of the Gamecube to $100. In the first week sales doubled and just recently they annoucned that their weekly sales in October had quadroupled. Its kinda sad to see that people waited so long to purchase such an excellent console.Now with the reduced price, sales are going through the roof. Parents and yound adults are looking in the direction of Nintendo, attracted by the price cuts. Normally their glances would have left out close inspection and they would have looked at that black tower, or the giant green X. But $100 is attractive to anyone and upon closer inspection they found an excellent console that was much much much better than any other console out there.GAMESNintendo produces quality games. No human being can deny that fact, they have always released quality and visually impressive games. However, when compared to the Playstation 2, the Gamecube may seem not to have as many games, but it sure does make up for lack of games with quality. Even if a console did have a huge selection of great games, how many people out there have enought money to purchase all 99 of those so called \"\"great games\"\"? Not me and I doubt anyone else is unlike me. So, by coming out with quality games, Nintendo has a few games, but nearly all of them are excellent.-Mario Cart: Double Dash!-F-Zero GX-Mario Sunshine-Star Wars Rouge Squadren Series-Mario Party series-Mario Golf-Zelda SeriesKeep in mind folks that all of the above games are exclusives, meaning that no other console out there features the game. If you want the oprotunity to buy these games, the Gamecube is the only possible solution. Most games are kid friendly, making this an excellent choice for the parent worried about their kids. I have no idea where the \"\"kiddie\"\" conontation came from. Nintendo has never been a \"\"kiddie\"\" company, and I am outraged that many folks haven't bought a Gamcube because of this.CONTROLLER-Nintendo produces the best controller on the market and also are the only company to produce a first party wireless controller; The Nintendo Wavebird.CONSOLE-The cool looking cube is visually attractive and comes in Black, Blue, and Silver. The small compact design is awsome for anyone who wishes to transport the console over to a friends or parents home. A carrying handle is permanently attached to the cube.Well thats pretty much it. I recenlty bought a Gamcube in August right before the price cut and I love it more than my Playstation 2 which I have over 61 games for and have had since Chirstmas 2000.\"", "Any fan of the Nintendo 64 needs this console to add more depth and knowlegde to their already large collection of games. I highly recommended a Gamecube for any fan. And soon the Gamecube Revolution will be released making another ultimate console due out in the future.", "Please know that I love Nintendo, and have owned all of their major systems. GameCube was the first of this generation of systems that I bought (I now own a PS2 and an XBox). I love Nintendo games, so I am happy with it. If I had to choose only one system, this would not be it.Pros:* Nintendo's own games (e.g. Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Metroid, Paper Mario) are some of the best in the industry.* The graphics and audio power of this unit are amazing.* The system is very portable, complete with a handle for carrying.* The controller is very ergonomic and easy to use.Cons:* Many major titles have not been brought to GameCube, even if they are on XBox AND PS2.* The system requires that you purchase memory cards, and a hard drive is not available.* Online gaming is not available (I think there might be one game), and is not encouraged by Nintendo.", "Sure gamecube is cool best good graphics ps2 x-box they practicaly evry game looks about the same i used too hate the controls and the controller not no more! its the next generation system! but the x-box has the best graphics out off all of em' ddesent controls and downloadable music and dvd player what more can u ask for yaknow!ps2 the best controls best controller out they folks but they brake too easaly from most gamers i heared of and sorta complicated! i cant explain it but i hate the controller now for some reson ever sense it broke and got a x-box!well over all for the cube it has the most fun games preety standered graphics but not the best we have seen the controls can get sloppy in some games good platinum color awesome nintendo!! you can hook up your game boy advance or sp too hit and pick up a gameboy advanced player soo you can play your favorite games on your gba or sp on your game cube you can use your controller too you dont need your gameboy advance just hook it in and go for 50 bucks!and gamecubes price is only 100 dollars now so people with not alot of money and want the next generation games just geta gamecube who cares what anyone thinks yaknow!", "\"As a games retailer, I have become keenly aware of the assets and drawbacks of each game system. The Nintendo Gamecube is often given short shrift when compared to the PS2 and the XBox. It's often seen as a \"\"kiddy system,\"\" appealing only to children and preteens. But when stacked up against the other two systems, it is second (barely) to the XBox in overall quality. The Gamecube features excellent graphics (a 485 MHz aluminum processor and an IBM CPU, second only to the XBox's 733 MHz) and smooth, even gameplay thanks to a three linked processors and twin Emotion Engines. This keeps framerates smooth, load times to a minimum, and allows for gorgeous graphics. Its hardware isn't as complex as the XBox's, but it makes better, more efficient use of what it has. Like the XBox, it has four controller ports for mulitplayer use (the PS2 has but two, and requires a separate multi-tap for extra players), and two memory card slots. It does have a couple of drawbacks when compared to the other systems, though: It won't play DVDs (Cube games are minidisc-based, not DVD-based) and currently there's no online play to speak of.In terms of games, the Cube does have a smaller selection of titles than the other two systems. However, this is largely due to the fact that Nintendo keeps most of its gaming licenses in-house, doling out a few to select companies. This means that although there are fewer games, the ones available are of good quality (unlike PS2, which will license anything, no matter how bad). Certainly, there are some bad games for the Cube--just a lot fewer than the other systems. Plus, certain titles and characters are Nintendo exclusives; you won't find Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Starfox, or Donkey Kong anywhere else. They also have exclusive rights to the excellent Star Wars: Rebel Strike. Plus, one can get Madden, Medal of Honor, NBA Street, and other popular titles for the Cube. Also, Nintendo has recently released a nice piece of hardware that expands the number of games available: The Gameboy Player (about fifty dollars) hooks up to the Cube and allows one to play Gameboy games on the television. Nintendo has often been criticized for having few Mature-rated games; this is largely due to their focus on keeping games kid- and family-friendly. Between the quality of games and the first-rate graphics and gameplay, I have to say that this system is an exceptional value, and is highly recommended.Suggested games: Mario Party 4 and 5, Luigi's Mansion, Metroid Prime, Animal Crossing, Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Starfox Adventures, Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, F-Zero GX, Soul Calibre, Mario Kart: Double Dash.Suggested accessories (when possible, stick with the Nintendo brand. They're the best quality): Memory card 251 (a must-have, as this is the only way to save games); a second controller (available in blue, black, and spice orange); for wireless play, get the Nintendo Wavebird, an excellent controller at a great price; the Gameboy Player (for playing GB games on the TV); if you have an older TV without RCA A/V jacks (red, yellow and white) that has a cable jack in the back, you'll need an RF adapter (about $15); racing wheel (I recommend the Logitech brand); if travelling with the system, I recommend the Intec gamescreen, which includes everything you need for portability.\"", "Labeled as a video game. Anyways, this console is a classic from my childhood that I just had to use again. It is a powerhouse with very fun games to play on it. You can leave it on for a long time without a heat issue which is rare for modern consoles. The included controller has a short cable but other than that this is a good buy.", "\"I've been a Nintendo fan since the SNES(Super Nintendo Entertainment System) and i have enjoyed all the classics since then, ecspecially the Mario franchise.Nintendo Gamecube is the latest in Nintendo's home console gaming and featues state of the art graphics wich were amazing...in 2001.As you may know or not know Nintendo is plannign on releasing a new consol soon,very soon.So is this truly worth buying?(Read on and decide for yourself)Gamecube had a strong,strong line up in the beggining of it's life span with instant classics like \"\"Super Smash Bros. Melee\"\"(duke it out in a crazy fighting game with Nintendo classics!) and \"\"Star Wars:Rogoue Squadron 2\"\"(or pit yourself into the realm of Star Wars and man your vehicle and prepare for war!).Even as the years rolled byNintendo got possibly better!With hits like \"\"Phantasy Star Online Episodes 1&2\"\"(one of the few online games on the GC, great RPG and it's multi player too!) and \"\"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle\"\" by working a few deals with Sega.Sadly the Gamecube started to become sluggish lacking the online features other consols now fully supportet speccifically X-box.Nintendo went their different ways but still managed to produced multiple titles that still had major success.Keep in mind Gamecube prodominatley features multiplayer games and child based games, but that doesn't stop them from releasing mature single palyer goodies like Resident Evil 4(one of the best games of ALL TIME!).Don't forget the Nintendo vault of treats to with all their franchises making epic returns and new arrivals, Animal Crossing is very addicting think of it as a wacky The Sims(in a nutshell that is).Super Mario Sunshine is Marios way back into people homes with all his platformer goodness and one of the greatest...Legend of Zelda:The Winder Waker, a powerful RPG conducted of elements from all the previous LoZ containing clean clear cell shaded styled graphics!All these good games and you wonder why a 4 star?Nintendo as i mentioned did superb, but then started disabling many titles that came out on PS2 and X-Box as if they wanted to kill off fanbase (but still failed, long live Nintendo!).With all that said you pick a Gamecube up for a relatively cheap price considering all the other system costs of around 150-200$.\"", "\"I'll start with the controller, since that is not addressed very often. The Gamecube controller may look funny but it dits rather comfortably in most hands and works well with most games, despite the three buttons less than the competition's. The digital cross-pad is not very comfortable to use, I think, because it's sort of detached from the left handle, making it hard to reach unless you have a long and very jointable thumb.It's true that the GameCube cannot play music CDs or DVD movies and, I'm not going to deny it, that is a weakness. If you want to watch DVDs, play music CDs, and play video games all in one system, the Gamecube is not for you. There is also minimal support from third parties, hence the long list of games available for the other consoles but not Gamecube. I'm not a sports fan, so the lack of sports titles doesn't bother me. The Gamecube also has no hard drive, and there are no plans to make one. Online play is limited to one or two video games, maybe a smattering more. There aren't too many bloody games on this system, because most third parties don't believe they blong there, and Nintendo's in-house development team is more interested in games not limited to adults.The strengths of the Gamecube rely on its first-party titles such as Animal Crossing, The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Metroid Prime.The Gamecube does have a lot of titles that are mostly aimed at children, but that doesn't make it a \"\"kiddy system\"\" per say. That is, unless you think BloodRayne, MK Deadly Alliance, Eternal Darkness, five Resident Evil titles, Red Faction 2, Blood Omen 2, Hunter The Reckoning, Turok Evolution, BMX XXX (which is uncensored on GameCube), the True Crime games, Dead to Rights, Eternal Darkness, and Hitman 2 are there just so mom or dad or an older sibling can play once in a while. Maybe that doesn't matter to some hardcore gamers since many of these titles are also available on other consoles. I still think this is just a result of jaded game companies who haven't forgotten or forgiven Nintendo for censoring the blood in Mortal Kombat on SNES and the sex in Duke Nukem 64 for Nintendo 64.The unit is rather small, measuring about 6x6x4\"\" without the GB Player attachment. It's fairly durable and travel-friendly.The Nintendo GameCube is a video game system, plain and simple, and if you want to know what's avaiable for it, feel free to look for the many Listmanias or \"\"So You'd Like To\"\"s right here at Amazon.com or check the databases at GameFaqs.com.\"", "Awesome Game system!!!

I bouoght GC just for this game and now I can honestly tell all of you that no doubt GC is supposedly for kids (that's what a lot of people say) but I can guarantee you it is not. Since having my GC, I bought Resident Evil Zero, Resident Evil Remake, 2, 3 and Finally The most awesome game ever to released RE: 4. I had so much fun and enjoyment playing GC. Not a moment did I experience problems with the console. It had surpassed my expectation and will forever keep me entertained. I did also purchase Price Of Persia 2 and enjoyed it very much. Do not underestimate the power of GC. The graphics are stunning and unbelievable.... I have no regrets whatsoever and certainly am recommending GC to everyone.... Try it!!!

High Praise 4 NINTENDO GAMECUBE!!!", "Why can nintendo just grow up and realize that normal people today only play games like GTA and Halo and not their gay kiddy games. Nintendo needs to realize that their gaycube was a flop and become like PS2 and Xbox. Games like mario and donkey kong are only for whipped kids of hypocritical evanangicals.Gta and company are for hip and open mined people", "Before I begin, just note that I am a completely unbiased gamer. I have owned at one time or another, many of the the nintendo, sony, and microsoft consoles, and love them all equally. After selling my cube recently to get a Wii, I recollected my memories of the cube, and pondered over whether it was a good investment.The answer, I found, was a hesitated yes.Here's why.Games-There are about a dozen really good ones, but overall, there is nothing special at all about the cube game library. Unfortunately, Nintendo had no third party support because of it's special discs and development kits, that were much harder to program than a PS2 or XBOX game. That was a huge mistake for nintendo, bacause it is very unlikely that a console can be successful without third party support. But when you do find one of the few rare jems, then the cube really shines. Examples of these would be:1. Super Smash Bros. Melee2. Mario Sunshine (kiddie, but fun)3. Resident Evil 44. Mario Strikers (sleeper hit that was suprisingly violent)5. Zelda Windwaker/ Twilight Princess6. Metroid Prime7. Tales of Symphonia8. Timesplitters 29. Mario Tennis10. Paper Mario11. Mario Kart12. Pikmin 2These games, while mostly kiddie (though a few are very violent), are some of the most fun you can have on a console of the gc/ps2/xb generation. These games alone make it worthy of a purchase, but maybe not strong enough to stand against the quantity of great games on other consoles.Design-This referes to only the design of the system and the controller. This is mostly a failure on nintendo's part, due to a couple key mistakes. First of all, the standard gamecube is purple. It is also a cube. Both these factors make looking at the gamecube extremely hard on the eyes, and those looking for a sleek addition to their home theaters will be extremely disappointed. But the interface of the system is wonderfully easy, and the inclusion of four controller ports made party games easy and fun.But another mistake was the the disign of the controller. First, there is the rediculous ABXY setup, which makes the A button too big, the B button too small, and the X and Y buttons positioned so akwardly, that playing games becomes a chore. The C stick is also a chore to use, because it is an unresponsive nub of a stick, that would have greatly benefited by becoming a full analog stick, like the main one on the left. The shoulder buttons could have also used a second set of triggers, instead of the completely useless Z button. But the controller is easy to get used to, and the big A button does mean simpler mechanics for simpler games. But considering the other two consoles had very similar controllers, this akward controller made porting games over to that cube increadibly wonky and undesireable.Hardware-Im not going to go into details, but the Cube's hardware is generally good, and graphics can almost compete with the XBOX (almost). Gamecube games also put you through much less loading times. the cube is also very reliable, and you will rarely, if ever, suffer through a crash. Cube discs did not allow developers to do as much as a PS2 or XBOX disc, but they work and there is not much to get offended by here. No online play is a big letdown, but the party games on the system almost made up for that as far as multiplayer goes. DVD functionality is somewhat of a letdown as well, but DVD is really not very important, when almost every other elecronic device can play DVDs. The lack of DVD support did not hurt the quality of games, so in the end who really cares?Price-Origionally $199 ($100 less than the competition)Dropped to $99 a few years later (much less than competition)You can now find them under $50 (still much lees than competition)nuff said.Overall-The cube is not nintendo's best effort, and I'm sure we will see much better from them in the future. But this is still a fun system to play with, and still has great value. Considering it is much cheaper than all the other consoles, it amounts to much less than it's competition, but much more than failure. That is why I give it an overall 3 out of 5.", "I've owned a purple Gamecube since it was released back in 2001. I have played it a ton until the Wii came out, since the Wii can play Gamecube games. If you are looking to buy a Gamecube get The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker, Metroid Prime 1 & 2, Mario Kart Double Dash, and Super Smash Brother Melee, just to get started.", "Im mostly a computer gamer, but I also have this system. I find it hard to find good games that arent RPG or adventure. Mariokart and madden are a few of the games ive been able to find for this system. What I like about this system, is its cheap price and portability. I can easily move it within a couple of minutes to another TV. The graphics are not as good as XBOX, but they are satisfying. Overall, I think this system is good, but its library needs a touch-up.", "\"Nintendo have always been known for quality wheather it be their hardware or software.  I have owned the platinum cube for about 8 months.  This really is a fun system that uses 3\"\" discs that store quite a bit of info (although not as much as xbox or PS2 which use dvd style discs.)  The Cube sports a wide and vast number of games for different gamers.  I got mine for $99.99 and don't regret buying it.  I have heard Nintendo have stopped producing the cube to make way for their new console (a shame) So if you haven't yet checked the cube or are curious for the current price its a steal and a good oppertunity to add Zelda Mario F-Zero and countless other games that are exclusive to Nintendo.  Oh and while your at it get the wireless wavebird controller for maximum fun.\"", "I have had many game systems over the years, while the Super NES will always be on the top of my list of best console ever.  The GameCube is not all that far behind.  Nintendo has games that are the best developed/designed/Mascots/etc. and that is something Sony and Microsoft can't claim.  I own both the PS2 and Xbox as well, but on days I don't know what I want to play I find myself playing games like Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong...(The list goes on and on).  The GameCube is an excellent second console if you already own one of the others.  Nintendo made the GameCube to be powerful but inexpensive, [less expensive] than the other two.  Don't be fooled by FanBoys out there that will tell you the cube is for kids, it has the horsepower to keep up with the PS2 and is close with the Xbox.  Yes it might not look like the coolest thing or have DVD player installed, but it can play games and does it GREAT!!!  Also don't miss playing the 2002 Game of the Year, Metroid Prime, because you can only play it on a 'Cube.", "\"XBox? PS2? Gamecube? Where to look?By now you probably own all three, or at least have in the past. But if not, and you're considering the Gamecube, listen up.The Nintendo GameCube, in my opinion, is the best console out of all three competitors on the current market. Its simple fool-proof design is the sturdiest, longest-lasting, and best looking of all the consoles. 90% of the time you will never have a single problem with the Gamecube. The other systems have about a 40-60% problem percentage. That's risking a lot for a console that you could easily spend a whole paycheck on.Who HASN'T heard the horror stories about PS2's going bad for no reason? Maybe it wasn't the laser that quit working, or just plain stopped reading discs; but perhaps it was one of the PHYSICAL components that broke, like the CD tray or perhaps the cooling fan. You don't have to worry about anything like that with the Nintendo Gamecube.So let's consider the XBox. Well, there's Halo...Halo 2...and well, I think that's about it. Sure you have the average racing games and the sports games, and you can probably store more than 1,000 CDs worth of MP3s on the unit, but let's face it - unless you're a hardcore FPS (first person shooter) fan, you're not going to be satisfied with the XBox.So what does the Gamecube have to offer? Oh, so much. There's so many secrets that so painfully few people have had the pleasure (or patience) of finding. On the outside, the Gamecube looks like a system geared towards the youth between the ages of 6-12. But upon further examination, you find that these \"\"kiddie\"\" games aren't so kiddie after all! They're actually quite fun.No, I'm not saying you should swear off \"\"Devil May Cry\"\" and fall in love with \"\"Dora The Explorer\"\", but you would be pleasantly surprised at many of the excellent titles that this console has to offer. Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and who could forget the Resident Evil releases? Games like \"\"Toadstool Tour\"\" will have you laughing comically at the cute characters and their \"\"moves\"\" - but at the same time you'll be ooohing and ahhing at the beautifully rendered backgrounds and smooth gameplay. Other famed titles like \"\"Zelda : The Wind Waker\"\" scored an average of 97/100 from numerous, numerous reputable sources. NINETY-SEVEN out of 100. Can you say Wow? And let's not forget the Resident Evil series. This is the whole reason I bought the console, and for the most part, these RE games do not disappoint.So while the Gamecube may not have hundreds and hundreds of titles that the PS2 and XBox have to offer, the quality of games certainly makes up for it. The added reliability factor of the Gamecube allows you to comfortably play whenever you please and spend less time worrying about how long the system will last. Many friends of mine have purchased several XBox systems and Playstation 2's, yet they are still on their first Gamecube. It's rather ridiculous how many video game systems these days are built with \"\"cereal box\"\" parts and poor craftsmanship.The crew at Nintendo refused to cut corners or add anything that really shouldn't be there (can anyone say a 60GB hard drive or a built-in DVD Player?), and simply chose remain faithful to the gaming community - excellent move, Nintendo. Any average game tech worth his paycheck knows that it's simply too much workload on a gaming system to have it operate like an all-in-one unit. It's pretty much like having a pack mule pull a passenger vehicle. It's a procedure that's bound to fail - and most of the time it does.Summary -PROS:Elegant, sleek, fool-proof designGreat construction and durabilityQuality gamesBest value on the marketCONS:Limited game libraryNo DVD-capability (if that's your thing; personally I don't care)Only one Final Fantasy title available for the system ;-)(...)\"", "GameCube isnt that good. Heres the good and the bad.Good:Its the cheapest.You could play clasic games like Mario.Its the most portible.It has four player.Bad:Its better fou younger kids like 5.It has the least amount of games.Its not a DVD player or a CD player.You have to buy a memory card.Most of the games are cortoons.", "I no longer play video games but my kids love this system.Theres tons of games for it and I admit I play Super Smash Bros Melee with them but I havent played a single player video game in years.Im too busy reading and listening to the radio but for those who have the time its a great system.", "I give this a 5 star rating because it is five star fun, but it is not as good as XBox or PS2.  Obviously Xbox would be the best because of its huge standard memory (which PS2 and GameCube can only dream of) and graphics that are way, way past PS2 and GameCube.  Graphic-wise I am pretty sure even PS2 is better.  Don't get me wrong, GameCube is a super fun system that I want, but I luckily decided XBox was the right way to go.  And if you do to you would never regret it.", "I own all three next-gen game systems, and by far, this is the one I use the most. I have played only a few good PS2 games, and zero good Xbox ones, but nearly every game I own for Gamecube is a winner.Yes, I am well aware that it cannot go online. Who cares? If you want to mindlessly battle over and over, on and on, over an ISP, go ahead and skip this console. But if you want true gaming brilliance in GC-exclusive titles like The Wind Waker, Paper Mario 2, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, Super Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, and every other amazing game that is available solely on this system, then I welcome you to the crowd of real gamers. Gamers who appreciate art and innovation in development, not pretty graphics and a bunch of shotguns.The bottom line is, if you don't buy this, you will never experience some of the most beloved franchises of gaming in all their next-gen splendor, nor will you witness the birth of countless promising new intellectual properties.Therefore, I declare the GameCube the system for the true gamer. The gamer who would rather play a real adventure on an older console than a slapped-together fragfest on an advanced graphics engine. The gamer who would rather live through an emotional adventure in single-player than play hundreds of identical battles with their friends. The gamer who shakes their head sadly whenever another exclusive deal or hostile buyout is announced, knowing that it only results in less originality.Does the gamer described above sound like you? Then buy this (but then again, if you're like that, you probably already own this console). Now, if you'll excuse me, this hardcore gamer has to go remove the letters E and A from her keyboard in protest.", "This is one of the best 6th generation consoles ever. What I enjoy about the gamecube is the ease of accessing my memory and when I need to delete memory on the memory cards. I know that this console is not as great as the Wii but when this first came out in 2001. It has and had its issues. I've had a couple a problems like for example when I plugged it in it wouldn't start, because I had the Gamecube sitting in a room with too much light coming in it so I unplugged it and took it somewhere where it was a little darker. Also I tend to play my games at night which I hold the belief my system functions better and doesn't have to deal with exposure to light. I love how quiet this system, it makes virtually no noise. Compared to the Wii there about the same but it all depends. I also love some of the accessories that Nintendo made but I will talk about those individually. The model I have is the early 2001 model with the Analog (A/V) and Digital (Component) which I don't use at the moment but might use later down the road which I will be sure to update this review, when I do. I This video game system is awesome so for anyone looking to buy a Gamecube go for it, It's an awesome system also lots of great games to look into. You can check out my reviews for info on games I highly recommend for this system. Also keep in mind on some games that have two discs vs. one disc keep in mind to keep those games especially clean and make sure the system can read them. I already have to buy a new copy of the Lord of the Rings The Third Age on Gamecube since the System was unable to read the discs.", "the nintendo gamecube is the best next gen console out there my very first video game console was the ps2 after having the ps2 for many years i hated the technical problems it had so i went and got the xbox 360 i like it but its not my favorite video game console then i got the original xbox and i thought it was the best console ever made i was wrong after buying a n64 and a super nintendo which are great consoles i saw a gamecube and i bought it i loved it after playing the gamecube i cant go back to the ps2 or the xbox it has great games and graphics BUY THE GAMECUBE NOW"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.054854098707437515, 0.06022970378398895, 0.0435509979724884, 0.00041883194353431463, 0.022958161309361458, 0.06775067001581192, 0.05437695235013962, 0.022877255454659462, 0.0005938376998528838, 0.012541497126221657, 0.048320040106773376, 0.0010758150601759553, 0.014823276549577713, 0.046867404133081436, 0.05250823497772217, 0.022096730768680573, 0.001145915943197906, 0.07133595645427704, 0.025039562955498695, 0.04975619912147522, 0.03436912223696709, 0.0031563714146614075, 0.01842011697590351, 0.010334070771932602, 0.011573080904781818, 0.010583160445094109, 0.04744604229927063, 0.02651122584939003, 0.057406168431043625, 0.003141673980280757, 0.10028398036956787, 0.0036538734566420317]]}
