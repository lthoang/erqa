But the first game in my alphabetized library is not *Half-Life* or *Max Payne*. Since I enjoy epic games as much as shooters, I bought and played *Civilization III*, the latest in Sid Meier's brilliant world-strategy series. Not exactly a sequel, I find *Civilization III* a polished and streamlined remake of its predecessor.What do I mean by remake? Well first let's take a look at the series. The original *Civilization* put the player at the head of a human pre-civilization. His or her job was to lead the people into recorded history, across 6,000 years to the present. The player could choose governments, build a war machine, control emigration, and develop science. Back in my day, *Civilization II* ruled the roost of intellectual strategy games (mainly because my computer could run it). But it also expanded greatly upon the original game, by increasing the types of units and concepts, by improving the existing units and concepts, and by adding various editor programs and expansions. After *Civ II* Activision developed a separate series-*Call to Power*. *CtP* added an entire future age; complete with a story and timeline. In other words, *Civ II* and *CtP* came that much closer to being epic and diverse.*Civilization III* does not step forward; it runs in place and shows off its muscles. And I have to admit; this game looks and plays pretty good. *Civ III* initially loads a bit slowly on my 1.05 Ghz and my 256MB. In-game reloading is quick and animation is generally smooth. The graphics easily surpass the previous titles, and includes unit animation as in the *Call to Power* offshoot. Looking at the map window is like looking at a real satellite image, and the terrain tiles blend together. I can't complain about the interface; the multiple menus of *Civ II* have folded into a single screen here. Handy buttons allow all unit commands to be quickly and easily issued by point-and-click (only the appropriate buttons will appear for each individual unit). I can complain that even on my gaming platform *Civ III* crashed several times, particularly when I was using catapults to bombard a rival city.The programmers at Firaxis don't bombard the player with features either. The watchword around the office must have been \"\"slim and sexy.\"\" Homogenizing the menus and adding a unit orders panel seems to have led to a complete revamp of the previous SOP. Trade no longer depends on special units; instead it is handled through the diplomacy screen. Diplomacy is accessed directly from buttons on the main map screen. Speaking of diplomacy, embassies and spies are also handled by buttons instead of units. Military units also no longer consume resources from individual cities; instead they simply cost gold from the national treasury. By the way, the player must now take extra caution when choosing city locations-terraforming doesn't exist in *Civ III*. Finally, the numbers of civilizations, government types, and victory time limits have been reduced.All the reductions and subtractions do not allow this game to step forward, at least when compared to the considerably longer and more developed *Call to Power*. But Firaxis doesn't let Civ *III* step back either. Many important additions make *Civilization III* relatively dynamic, and the most important to me is the concept of Culture. Previous games lacked political boundaries, which meant the player's civilization was always a collection of city-states. Any rival civilization could walk right in and start planting its own cities. In *Civ III* your cities still claim personal resource squares, but they also generate a Culture influence. Each city's culture grows if the right improvements are built. The areas of influence not only overlap to claim an entire mass of land and sea, but neighboring cities may defect if their own culture is too weak to resist. Along with the concept of Culture is the concept of Strategic Resources, which are needed to build certain units and improvements. Civilizations will automatically collect any resources falling within the culture boundary, provided said resource is connected by road or rail.It may seem to the reader by now that *Civilization III* is more realistic than its ancestors. Many of the changes and eliminations have been balanced out by concepts such as Culture and Strategic Resources. The manual explains most of the revisions and additions.And yet the world of *Civilization II* remains. From the graphics to the game play, *Civilization II* is polished and revised to make this current incarnation. I was a bit disappointed at first, when I realized that so many concepts and units were cut back. But once I realized *Civ III's* place as a classic remake, I relaxed and just played the game. For a shoot-`em-up guy like me, that's pretty civil.\"", "The Civilization series is perhaps the best video series of all time, or at least is certainly up in the Top 2 or 3.  If you haven't played any of them yet, prepared to get VERY addicted, as you lead your civilization through a grand sweep of time, from the stone age right all the way to the modern age and beyond.  Casual gamers beware - you will become hard core after you buy this game.That said, Civ 3 isn't much different from the previous games - it doesn't change much in an already great formula.  So, if you still dig the Civ games, buy this now!  However, I found myself wishing for improvements in the areas that have always hurt this series:  The AI still mindlessly swarms all over the map;  the difficult levels are still just a &quot;cheating handicap&quot; for the computer;  the new diplomacy options are completely wasted on the moronic AI;  the warfare model is still rather crude;  blah, blah, blah.  Also, the basic Civ playstyle has changed in small but important ways, enough that I still prefer Alpha Centauri.", "I like this game.  But, it's just the same Civilization, just with better graphics.  I got bored with it very quickly.  Probably because I've already played it.  Great concept, they just need to find a way to make turns go faster.  I would play my turn, then go do dishes or something while the computer took it's turn.  That's how long it could last.", "\"There are only a few games I have stuck with to completion and Sid Meier is the only developer that has produced two of them - Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri.  This is not a reflection on the quality of other fine titles such as Half-Life, Quake 2, Diablo 2, Red Alert or others (I did finish the original Quake and C&C; though), it's just that I suffer from \"\"Adult Deficiency Disorder\"\" - there are so many new titles coming out that it's easy for me to put down what I'm currently playing.  The failure of others to copy his formula stands as a testament to how addictive his games are. I, like many of you, was highly anticipating this new offering.The graphics are up-to-date, and the game runs smooth.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the now-common annoyance of dumping the entire game on your hard drive (well, technically it's \"\"minimal\"\" install will put 500MB on the drive but it's good enough to deserve 700MB of space.)  I've only been playing this game a short while, but I'm writing this review to counter those who say this game is simply a cleaned-up version of Civ2.  They couldn't be further from the mark.One major difference in this new Civilization is the removal of the so-called \"\"unit block\"\", the tactic of placing units at various places on the map to block other units from passing by.  I used to exploit this weakness frequently to keep other civilizations from entering my territory or other lands I was planning on settling in.  Now units pass side by side without problem and even trespass on other lands quite frequently.The AI has significantly improved in this game as well.  I used to collect information and trade skills with every nation I had diplomatic relations with.  Now it's much more difficult to trade freely.  It's apparent I can no longer wheel and deal my way to greatness.  Instead the computer opponents are much more demanding and I usually can't trade skills without getting the short end of the bargain.  This will make winning the game thru economic domination much more difficult.I was able to beat both Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri the first time around.  Of course I made mistakes along the way and did things I would do differently had I played again, but for the most part I found the games challenging, but not difficult to beat.  Already in two plays of this game at monarch level (second from easiest), I have had to retire early as I am getting my (...) whooped!  The dynamics of this game have changed dramatically compared to the other two.  My initial impression is success in this game is more dependent on a \"\"land-grab\"\" strategy.  At least that's what the computer opponents seem to be doing.I'll put up a more comprehensive review once I get further along in the game.\"", "Civilization II is my all time favorite computer game. When I lost that game when a computer virus damaged my hard drive I recieved the Third edition of this series. And what a utter crock of $h!t. I am so dissapointed I am almost crying in disbelief.There are so many thing that completely ruin the qualities of this so called game. First you can't bribe rival units. Second, there is no cheat mode to toggle. Third there is no complete it button to spend money to build improvements, units, or wonders. God, is there no end to this sorry story.I felt so excited when I got this game for my birthday but when I installed it all it did was crash almost a few minutes after starting and it wrecked my hard drive. Needless to say is that this is nothing but a computer wrecking hunk of garbage.I personally am going to the computer store and am buying a replacement copie of the Second civilization. This one on the other hand will be sitting on the shelf and collecting dust or heading to the garbage can.Maybe if my computer is fixed and upgraded this game will be playable and given a higher rating but from where things stand right now this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever.For those who are rushing out to buy this: Stick with your older versions because all this one will do is eat up hard drive space and ruin your hard drive.", "Civilation 3 is the best civ game so far. As many people know, the last civ game, Civilization Call to Power was a huge dissapointement. Even though the graphics were improved, the gameplay was dissaproved. The gameplay was trumendously bad. The was because the Sid Meider did not make the game. Sid came back, and made the next civilization.Civilization 3 is a cross between Civ 2 and Civ: Call to Power. It has the great gameplay of civ 2 and the good graphics of Call to Power. This is why I recommend the game to everyone.Newbies, if you have no idea what i am talking about, here is a review for Newbies:Civilization 3 is, i think, the best game to start out with. Civ 3 has some better menu commands, and it comes with a civ dictionary, so u can find out every term that may come to use with you. Don't be scared of the 300 page instruction manual. You don't need it. If you want to read it, it will give you a lot of background knowledge. If not, just play the tutorial. My newbie civ friends learned right away how to play just by doing one or two tutorial games. It's simple and fun!I RECOMEND CIV 3 FOR EVERYONE!!!", "If you even ever play a turn-based game and liked it, I would highly recommed Civilation 3.  The game is one of the best of its kind.  Challengeing, fun, and a perfect learning curve.  But this comes with time. At first when I got this game I thought I had bought a poorly game with good graphics.  But after making myself play for hours I came understand why the game has the &quot;annoying&quot; features.  Features like demands, towns turn over to a another empire, ect.The games A.I is great, the best I have in a turn base game.  Just has impressive is the trading.  Things you do at start of game will come in play with trading.  Say you wipe out the Rome(for no reason) at 2250 b.c.  Later at 1955 a.d civilations will view you has a hostile empire and not trade.  This is very annoying but make you rethink delcaring war.  Another great bonus is the good graphics and good sound.I highly recommed this game.  But if you don't have time it is shoveware.  It takes around 30 hours just to get good.  Other than that it is a great game.", "My opinion of Civlization III is based on the fact that I have played its predecessors.  If you haven't played any of the Civilization games, by all means, purchase this game as quick as possible because you have no idea what you're missing!  A time encompassing game primarily about world conquest, you control a civilization from caveman times to the present day and expand world borders attempting to win the game in different ways.  The third version of this popular series still follows the same gameplay format that made it a universal favorite and that's why I had problems with it: It didn't change much.I suppose it's difficult for a software company to live up to a famous title's reputation when it's already one of the classic strategy games of all-time but I didn't feel like I got my money's worth after playing this game for a week.  Frankly, I'm already bored with the game.There are some new and interesting changes to the game.  One of the most obvious new features is a system that relies on specific resources (oil, rubber, etc.) rather than allowing you the ability to build anything you choose.  Another great new feature is the expanded diplomacy option with just about anything in the game available for trading with other countries.  The game is much smarter now and computer opponents make better decisions.  This may have led to what I find one of the biggest problems in the game, the incredibly slow running speed.  The more computer controlled civilizations you allow in your game, the slower it runs from turn to turn.  Even with low amounts of civilizations, when the game has progressed to a later point in time and the world is heavily populated, it can take at least a minute for the computer to decide its moves in one turn.  I have a decent system and would recommend that anyone with a slow processor be prepared to practice their patience as you will be playing games that will take a LONG TIME.  I have no problem with strategy games that take a while before completing the objectives but Civilization III loses its appeal when I make decisions in a few quick seconds and then wait a minute or two for the computer to complete its turn.If this is your first time to play the Civilization series, the instruction manual is phenomenal and it is equipped with an in-game encylopedia that describes all units, buildings, wonders, etc. to you.  I was disappointed that the game didn't come with enough new aspects to force me to read the instructions much.  I jumped right in to Civilization III as though I didn't miss anything from the previous version.The provided scenarios/maps aren't near as good as the other versions and civilizations do not start in their historically correct positions on a simulated world map.  I would check the internet as there are bound to be plenty of interesting maps and modifications created by players.  Also, the game does not come with a multiplayer internet format.  Knowing the recent history of PC games, the company will probably release a costly expansion pack in later months that will allow you to play this on the internet with other players.A great game for anyone that is new to the Civilization series but in my opinion, only a fair game for returning players.", "I bought this thinking I'd find a new game, with new units, with some interesting changes from the previous two versions.Instead, I got Civilization that was released in the early 90s with new graphics.There is nothing new that I would justify this being called a sequal.  This is simply a re-make of a great game.  It's not worth the investment in the high price they are asking for this item.", "This game is now a few years old but still the best version of Civilization in my opinion. I played Civ IV for many years after it came out, and really just did not enjoy it nearly as much as Civ III (although it had good replay value due to the expansions and scenarios). While IV added the culture aspect as an influence and victory condition, it lost some truly great aspects of the game that were in III--mainly involving advanced diplomacy options with other nations. Civ III will always be the best version of the 5 games in my opinion."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.011475940234959126, 0.03275454044342041, 0.16364791989326477, 0.002423137193545699, 0.13154038786888123, 0.0015738155925646424, 0.13879457116127014, 0.2586842179298401, 0.1659705638885498, 0.09313491731882095]]}
