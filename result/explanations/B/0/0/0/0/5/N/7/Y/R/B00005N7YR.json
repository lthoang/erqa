I have RTCW and was fairly bored throughout.  I downloaded the demo for this game and played it over and over and put RTCW back on the shelf.  I just got the full version and to say I am impressed is an understatement.  No endless running around inside castles - the variety inside this game in just the first few levels is truly awesome.  Every FPS compares itself to Half-life.  This game (so far at least) appears even better!  Hard to describe - JUST TRUST ME AND BUY IT!. (if you like FPS that is....) Stunning graphics, and the sound is amazing.  But most of all it has great game play.  Great eye candy alone doesn't make a great game - but combine that with great game play, and you have a winner.  This game will be the benchmark to compare other FPS to.", "MoH vets will be right at home in this, the first pc edition of the classic Ps2 game.  Stepping into the muddy boots of Army Ranger Jimmy Patterson it's out of boot camp (with a great advisory voice over by retired USMC Captain Dale Dye) and off to the battlefield.  And what a battlefield.  Jim will be taking part in many daring WW2 missions, embarking in Africa and spanning the globe to frost-bitten Germany.  And yup, there's that now famous Normandy Landing to make it through in piece.The graphics are crisp and (very) realistic, if your graphics card is up to the challenge.  A downloaded blood patch will add some realistic gore if that's your thing...otherwise its just puff's of dust when you rip into those naughty German's with your Thompson carbine.  The sound is also pretty involving, as bullets zip overhead, grenades go boom, and your squad mates bark orders and scream for medics.  In fact its a lot like real war.  Without the potato peeling in between levels.With lots of varied landscapes to hide behind, and a nice (and authentic) variety of shooty tools to play with you'll have a blast on your first play through the game.Sadly its a very scripted experience, and once you've pegged where that german sniper is, you'll find him waiting patiently every time you play through.  This is particularly true of the riviting Omaha Beach level.  The first time through you'll be in veritable shell-shock at the detail crammed into the level...from staggering out of your higgin's boat under intense mg42 fire, to the agonising crawl up the beach as your fellow rangers are blown sky high its a level that will go down in video game history.  But make no mistake, it'll still be the same when you play though the next time.  And the next time.Still, there's a brilliant multiplayer game to duke it out in, with lots of diffent levels to suit the junior rocketeers as well as the wily snipers.  I'd certainly give this five stars for the first time-through single player game...and the multiplayer saves it from being a one-hit-wonder.  Add on the short-but-sweet Spearhead expansion pack and you've got one fine military crusade.  On the ready line soldier, time to hit the beaches...", "I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars, but no lower. The game is without a doubt fun. From driving a tank to blowing up anti-aricraft guns, this game has been very solid. Graphically, it's good though not as good as Return to Castle Wolfenstein. the sound is very solid too except for the grenade explosions which sound like a popping balloon. Here are some of the bad things:1. All of the guys run around like they have stomach cramps2. You can't see very far becasue the graphics get pixally. You can't tell if there is a man in the guard tower or if it is a rail.3. The online play is slow and connection is laggy (My commputeris a Dell PIII 1000mhz, 256 rdram, 64meg video card and I have a cable modem and just getting connected to one of the servers is chore). And alot of the maps it's just a sniping battle.4. You and some of the enemies are like Superman. I shot one guy in the head 3 times and started targeting someone else when the guy got back up and started shooting me. So I shot him 3 more times and he got back up again. Same thing for you except you can take even more damage.Heres what is good:1. Some very interesting levels, especially Omaha Beach. Anything you heard about that is for real. It is definitley the best level and one of the hardest (You got to play to find out why).2. No end bosses. I get tired of playing games that have an end boss all of the time. Seem like all FPS do anymore.3. Nice stories and missions (I was worried in the beginning as it seemed all you did was follow other around while they killed everything. Kind of boring in the beginning)4. Lotsa of different scenery and things to do. There is a level where you have to take out some anit aircraft guns and other units in a heavily wooded area covered in snow. These levels are by far the best graphics and sound in the game. Everytime the breeze blew, I swore one of them dogs was coming at you. Very nicely done. Kept me on edge the whole time.The only other complaint I have is at time the AI was bad. I shot a guy in the back and had to reload my weapon and he didn't even check to see who shot him. Just kept walking. Another time, I came to a depot with 2 guards in 2 different towers and 4 on the ground. I picked them off one at a time with no alarm going off and the other guys didn't seek cover. Anyone who played RTCW knows that those guys came after you in a hurry.But this game is definitely worth it. If the Internet play (which is still pretty fun if you can get on. Unfortunately it is on Gamespy which I think is horrible) were alot better and a little faster paced, this would be one of the best FPS's ever. Oh well, maybe when Half-Life 2 comes out......A little update on the internet play. They now have a patch you can download that gives you an in-game browser, but it has to reload everytime you want to change games or it says server is full. The game also plays a little better, but is still laggy.", "I've been a longtime fan of Medal of Honor since it first began on the PSone. I've collected them and will continue to collect them as I love war games and first-person shooters.  Needless to say, when this came out, I had to check it out. I must say I'm impressed. EA did an excellent job with this game for the PC. I hope they continue to make the Medal of Honor series for the PC. I think everyone needs a taste of MOH. It's thoroughly engaging, exciting and intense with reality based objectives. The graphics are crisp, and they make use of the Quake 3 Engine quite nicely. Although, they lack the detail and atmosphere of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, at least to me. The Medal of Honor series has always been famous for its' sound so it's no surprise that this game has exceptional sound. Everything from germans speaking to shotgun fire, everything is topnotch. That's what gets you so engulfed in the game because you feel as though you're actually there. Control is deadon. The gameplay is quite challenging, too, especially the Omaha Beach level.I really loved this game and highly recommend it to all first-person shooter fans or war fans alike. You'll find after playing it that you could be playing one of the greatest shooters of all time. Sure, it may have alot in common with Return to Castle Wolfesntein(which is an outstanding game in its' own right) but this is a reality based game.I salute and honor all those who served in World War 2 just as this game strives to honor them. Thank you for all that you've done.", "If the PC port of the game is even half as good as the PSX version, it's going to rock. Medal of Honor (and to a lesser extent, its sequel) is one of the best first person shooters I've ever played. It also happens to be a very good representation of World War II combat. The weapons represented in the game really are what was avaiable during the war (in other words you're not running around with an M-16 wasting everything in sight) The ammunition dispersal is realistic. You take it off dead enemies, steal it from warehouses.  The missions are very plausable. You had to take out German weapons productions, stop the Nazi A-bomb, and destroy a V-2 rocket lab.  And, unlike most other games, you do have to watch what you shoot! If you nail an oxygen tank, for example, you and anything withing ten feet is done for. I've seen some screen shots for this game. They look absolutely amazing. Then again, that's what gamers can expect from a Quake III engine game.", "Allied Assault may not seem much different from other first-person shooters, but it is in every way. For one thing, Allied Assault is the most realistic game ever created in terms of plot and storyline. Of course, it follows WWII and many important events during the war. For some, it may seem like a history lesson for the gaming world. In some ways, it is, but it also brings an enormous amount of enjoyment along with it. Who could not like playing the D-Day level over, and over, and over again, honestly? That is the most fun I have ever had while playing a PC game! That brings me to my next point, which is that the level design is incredible! On the D-Day mission, U-Boats flood the shoreline, gunfire flies everywhere, and soldiers are running along the beach, fighting for their life as explosions occur right on their tail. This is the most incredible portrayal of real life in any game, just like in MOH Frontline for consoles. The other levels are very fun, and some are quite hard, even on the easy setting, such as in the sniper level. They hide in homes and lean out of windows. You are being shot, and not knowing where it came from. That is another incredible feature of the game. The controls are very smooth, and although they follow the same basic scheme as all other FPSs, they are much easier because they flow better. For any Castle Wolfenstein junkies out there, yes, that game is fun and we all know it, but this game is much better. Who thought up the idea of zombie Nazis anyway? Probably a pothead or a very sick and violent person. Allied Assault is the best game in the MOH series, and while it may not have the flair of Frontline, it still is a must game to buy for FPS lovers, or any fan of action-packed gaming!", "Finally I have played a game that surpasses the Best Game of All Time, Half-Life.  Even your stubborn old Dad who hates video games will want to play this one, once he sees it.  Metal of Honor: Allied Assault (MoHAA) is 30 missions in Northern France and Europe that will take you through WW2 like you have only seen in movies.  MoHAA is beautiful, it is exciting, and it often reminded me of what my grandfathers went through.  Parts of the game are ripped straight out of great war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, or even Schindler's List, with a little flavor of Indiana Jones mixed in there to temper the sometimes harsh events.MOHAA is intensely beautiful.  Every image I ever had of WWII is present - the U-boat facilities, the bombed french villages, the concentration camps, the bridge from the finale of Private Ryan, or the creme of the group - the invasion of Omaha Beach, D-Day, present in every tiny detail.  At times, there is so much action going on, so many soldiers rushing around me, there I just stopped to admire the detail (and promptly was shot into a thousand pieces).  I was often amazed how far video games have come, I saw so much progress in this game. The music is Hollywood-quality, and the sound effects deserve special mention, as I think the developers used actually weapons to create the very convincing sounds I heard.If only you had time to admire the scenery.  The enemy AI is outstanding, and will definitely keep you on your toes:  German soldiers fire from behind cover, or run to find a better position.  They hide in towers and dark corners and rush you from all directions.  One mission has you moving through a destroyed French town crawling with Nazi snipers, another has you creeping through the woods in the middle of dense fog, looking for a hint of the enemy between the trees.There are only a few minor problems, and I mean minor.  The game requires a very powerful computer, more than it's minimal requirements.  There are a few graphical glitches here and there, but nothing distracting or important.  The multiplayer portion isn't all that great, but who really cares?  You don't buy this game for the multiplay.A landmark game.  A piece of history.  Something you can show your father, maybe even your grandfather.", "I was hooked on this game shortly after the multiplayer demo came out and have been playing it ever since.The single player game drops you right in the middle of WWII and allows you to experience some of the most well known battles of the war.  Each campaign demands different techniques.  In some you are storming through bunkers machine gunning everything in sight, while another puts you in the middle of a dreary sniper-ridden village where paranoia reigns supreme.  Along the way you'll work with and be assisted by other troops who are more than willing to put themselves in harms way for you.  My only complaint is that the single player game is a bit too short.  There were more missions than I was expecting, but I wanted more.The multiplayer game is a different beast all together.  There is a different set of maps for multiplayer.  The games range from free-for-all (deathmatch) to objective based team matches.  The multiplayer game is as least as much fun as the single player.  The biggest downside here is the use of Gamespy.  The game has an internal browser for finding network games, but you'll probably find yourself using Gamespy since the internal browse is quite poor.  With Gamespy you'll be subjected to watching ads (unless you decide to register it) just to find a game to play.Finally, I just have to say the initial release of this game was terribly buggy.  After playing the demo for months with no problems I installed the release version to have it continuously crash on me early in the game.  I was stuck with a non-working game until the patch was finally released.  I had similar experiences with F1 2001 and Black &amp; White.  EA's initial releases are clearly beta (at best) and should be treated as such (ie: don't expect much until the first patch is out).  Luckily the patch for MOH is out now and most of the problems appear to be resolved.", "This is the best wwII game out get this but theres no blood so when you shoot some one in the head dust puffs fly out lol but there is a patch you can get to see blood but the 1st time you see dust puffs fly out of someone it will give you a chuckle lol get this game it really is good  :)", "As is said above, this is definatly the best WW2 FPS out on the market now, the game runs very smootly on my P4 1.8 GHZ 32mb graphics card and below averge 128RAM, stomping down and choking the never ending lagginess of BattleFeild 1942 and having enough relism to seriously injure the Nazi Zombies and Demons of RTCW. The graphics are pretty good and run perfeclty on Medium and slightly laggy on High, but still are very stunning on my prefered setting, medium texures with all the other settings at high. The level disign is fanstastic, every level has some stupendous, exciting part of it, from Running up a hill in a line with your 5 squad menmbers in the Algiers level, to looking out at the never-ending horizon of the ocean in a Nazi U2 harbor, with an ever moving and dynamic factory behind you, or storming up the long and hard beaches of omahah beach in normandy with constant explosions, men running up the shoreline, men hiding behind dragons teeth (the tank traps) and frequent reinforcements coming from boats back at the shoreline, that D-Day level is great, beef up the sound quality to high, put you two speakers on your left and right sides, turn them up as high as they go, and you will be completly immersed in the virtual normandy, and constanly lost in all the exlosions and gunfire of fake war. My second favorite level in in Brittany, France, which looks just like the sniper and child scene in saving private ryan, with houses blown in half with blackened, powdery furniturte inside, snipers hiding in church towers, and a rumbling thunder storm overhead with an occasional bolt of lighting to scare you in a few places. After defeating all the eagle eyed and Inhumanly accurate Nazi Snipers in the area, it can be very good for you to walk around and appreacitate the scenery. So the level design and scenery is fanstastic, and it runs pretty well on slightly below-average computers, so what about the gameplay. Well, this game, i'll tell you now, Is definatly now for Rainbow Six fans, it is definatly a shoot-em-up where you shoot anything that moves with infuriating rage and ignoring all aspects of stealth whatsoever. But the people who like those games will definatly love this one, with its realistic weapon sounds, satisfying death animations, and a great grenade throwing method (you dont have to waste time holding the mouse button, just press it once and there goes the grenade). But people who like the realistic game will slightly like this one too, the sound is so realistic, the AI is pretty good (watching nazis run from and incoming granade and then seeing a couragues one kick it back at you is too cool), and realistic squad commands can make this game a favorite for both types of gamers. Lastly, the multiplayer experience is great, I've been playing it on a dial up modem, and you can move and doge bullets at lag-less speeds, but after you press fire, you have to wait about 1/2 a second before the gun actually fires. Its still great though, Imagine this, two allied players stand on the side of a door, another comes in between them and opends it, all of a sudden all hell is let lose and the door-opening player is blown back by sudden machine gun fire, the other two player both lean out to avenge their freind's death, but fail to escape the explosions of the two grenades that suddenly come lobing from the door, about four nazis player spring from the door feeding many machine gun bullets at the remaing allied troops, and after about a half minute full of gunfighting, the four nazi players are finnaly eliminated in one titanic instant from two lucky allied machine-gunners. The objective mode, which was just described, is pretty team based, although there are many people who refuse to work. This mode has a certain objective to each level, such as Nazi team blow up a bridge, allied team defend it, Nazi team protect you rocket, Allied team blow it up, and the same thing with a flak cannon. This is definaly the preffered mode over the average FFA, team FFA's, and No Respawn FFA. The objective mode is pretty much a No Respown Team FFA, with the addition of the objectives and the relating teamwork. As in the single player mode, level design is great, with many sniping spots in French villages, close-combat in the V2 Rocket facilty, and a combantion of both in The Bridge level, plus theres a multiplayer objective map that is omahah beach itself, only with re-spawns for the allies. After beating the single player mode, I have been completly obssed with multiplayer, and even thoughe that part is not nearly as good as Battle Feild 1942, is a very, very big loud blast.", "\"I have to say, the whole nazi killing and world war 2 thing has gotten kinda boring. A year ago, I was excited for this game's release, and I am highly dissapointed.I had also been looking forward to RTCW, and this is a very good game. I have to admit, it is fun, but the story is dull, the violence is toned down, you have to play multiplayer on Gamespy Arcade, which swarms you with advertisements the instant you open it. I am highly dissapointed to see such a great game have so many downpoints, that I actually rated the game \"\"so, so\"\"The other thing is that the system requirements are way, and I mean way, to high. The system requirements are 500mhz with 64 megs of ram. My 500mhz P3 computer with 256 megs of ram doesn't cut it. If you think that your old computer will do the job, think again. My computer has done nothing but crash and freeze day and night. This is very strange because I also have a radeon 8500 GPU, which should also have done the trick.Except for the toned down violence, the gameplay is pretty good. (This game also has relitively bad AI too). Most of the time, the blood helps you out, and you find out if you have hit the person or not. I found it annoying when I thought I would kill someone and they would just run right up to me and shoot me dead.I like the choice of weapons in the game. You have machine guns, a rocket launcher, rifles, SMG's, pistols, and some far out grenades.To sum it all up, this game is good, but with many downsides and the system requirements are too steep. Hope this helps! This should be a good game on high end computers.\"", "\"I was skeptical of buying MOH:AA at first, but after reading various comments of others and formal reviews, I decided to take it on. Boy was I glad I did!Allied Assault presents some of the most realistic feeling, immersive war-time experiences ever incorporated into a video game. While the game itself is not realistic as far as damage and equipment carrying goes, etc.., the sound, graphics, missions and locations are incredibly well detailed and produced.  The atmosphere is very immersive and the attention to detail regarding 1940's WWII locales is tremendously recreated.The Normandy Beach mission, straight out of \"\"Saving Private Ryan,\"\" provides one of the most memorable PC gaming moments ever. Your mouth will remain open as you dodge explosions, watch your men die and fall around you as you approach the beach and run for cover from the German fortifications.The cut scenes are done a-la \"\"Half Life\"\" where you are able to control your character's point of view while they are running, a very good choice.Most importantly MOH:AA provides a lot of varied missions, preventing it from getting monotonous, lots of action and intense gun fights, and using natural elements as obstacles make for a realistic experience despite the run-n-gun style of the game. At one point I was driving a tank blowing up buildings full of snipers, in another I was running through German countryside using tomb stones as cover from a nest of Nazi's holed up in a bombed-out church (see the SP demo).The game is a bit short in duration, but has a significant replayability factor in that you can go back and play on 3 different difficulty settings, and pick and choose which mission you would like to play over again. Every time you complete a mission, it will be done slightly differently depending on your weapon(s) of choice, strategy, and ability to shoot accurately.The multiplayer mode has serious potential, but has yet to reach it. The ability to play in co-op mode through the single player missions with others would be a great addition to the game, and a MOD is already available which does just that, covering the infamous Normandy Beach Invasion (D-Day).Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, is certainly one of the best First Person Shooters ever made, and if you enjoy games like No One Lives Forever, you'll love Allied Assault as well, an instant classic from EA Games and 2015 (ID Software). You will need a Pentium III 600mhz processor or better, and a 64MB video card of high quality to run the game at respectable rates, keep in mind, in my opinion. The game's requirements are indeed quite high, even at lower detail levels.I play a lot of different PC video games, RPG, Adventure, Sports and FPS genres, and Medal Of Honor is definitely a game I can recommend without hesistation.\"", "I would really love to have someone release a WWII shooter that actually felt like WWII.  And while EA likes to boast the realism, frankly that only goes as far as the weapons, the launguages and the location.  The game is 100% linear and 99% predictable, and after finishing it, I feel more like I have finished reading a book, not playing a game.  Honestly, the mistakes are so glaring that EA really could have made a better game if they would have tried harder.  This is definatly one you will need to try for yourself, and reach your own conclusions on.The GOOD:- Missions remain interesting throughout the game.- Some wonderfully scripted encounters, and occasionally you will get to see wonderful character actions in your allies as well as your enemies.- Nice range of American and German weapons, and fairly accurate noises.  Tanks are fairly life-like as are aircraft.- Lots of speaking (English and German).  Scripts are correct for the locations, and you don't run into situations where dead soldiers are carrying on conversations and such, as you do in some other titles.- Accurate uniforms (within reason).- Sniper rifles are accurate, powerful and fun (and there are plenty of opportunities to use them, if that is your thing).The BAD:- The graphics are not as good as, for example, Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the Xbox (I'm using a Nvidia GeForce4 64mb DDR video card), or as nice as Delta Force Blackhawk down (which is a better game).- When shot, your character's aim flies across the screen.  This may enhance the realism, but when you are confronted with multiple enemies it makes it virtually impossible to hit anyone and soon becomes incredibly annoying.- Enemies have certain locations from which they spawn, in fact you can find them and stand there and gun them down as they suddenly materialize.  Also, some enemies (like snipers) have not materialized until you step past a certain point (into their line of fire) and then they spawn and fire.- Cannot interact with surroundings (doors, windows, etc.)- Lack of blood (to maintain the Teen rating).- Very linear.The UGLY:- MG42/44 is lethal in the hands of the enemy, but when you have the opportunity to man one the bullets fly everywhere but where you are aiming, in fact, the machine gun is only slightly more effective than any of your standard arms, and much more frustrating to try and use.- Allied AI is NIL, and considering some of these guys are supposed to be Rangers...they just run into the open and fire then stop, then fire and stop again while they are being gunned down.  I was happy to see them get slaughtered so at least I could move (oh yah, you are stuck behind any obstacle as if it were twice as wide as it really is).- Enemies continue to rush you with no regard to their own casualties, and will even run from around a corner straight into your fire, requiring no effort from you to gun down entire squads.- Shrubbery and leaves will block your bullets, but not the bullets of the enemies, making Snipers almost impossible to kill unless you rush their positions.- Snipers are way too good (even when I knew exactly where they were they could see me before I could see them).- The signifigant lack of an ending of any sort is unforgiveable.  What did they do, just give up halfway through???", "This game has good controls and great graphics. I had loads of fun killing nazis... I especially liked being a sniper and blowing their heads off... You can also shoot their dogs (wish they were pit bulls...) Follow the missions and accomplish your assigned tasks and have fun killing along the way. It really is a good game and well worth the money. I can't imagine how hard storming the beaches would be in a difficult mode. Easy was hard enough... And, you CAN play it on Windows XP...", "Medal of Honor Allied Assault is a great game. The grafics are good and the missions are really fun. In one mission you behind enemy lines and are pretending you are a german officer. Theres alot of weapons to choose from. If you liked the Medal of Honor Frontline you would probobly like Medal of Honor Allied Assault.", "Medal of Honor : Allied Assault is a fps set in the real world during the second world war and you get to play an american soldier. The multiplayer gameplay is poorly designed but the single player gameplay is excellent with great level design, fairly good enemy ai and intresting missions, But it has the worst ending ever in a computer game. The d-day mission is one of the best levels ever in a fps, it makes you feel as if you are really there and it is quite disturbing, It alone is worth buying the whole game. Mohaa is built on the quake3 engine, I played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. The graphics and sound are great but the main menu is badly designed and confusing. The load times are not long and the quick loading is almost instant. Medal of Honor : Allied Assault is an excellent computer game and not to be missed if you like fps.", "Medal Of Honor is without a doubt the best historical military fps game to date. The realism with the weapons and uniforms is unprecedented for a fps style game. Excellent graphics and playability make this game a must own for military game lovers.I really hope they make a sequel to it.", "I have never played the MOH series before so I was brand new to the scene when I picked up MOH: Allied Assault last week. I was very impressed. Medal of Honor is a very well made game and is a lot of fun to play. Here is a quick rundown of my opinions on the game:Graphics: The graphics are very good, but I have seen better. (Namely, Return to Castle Wolfenstein) The game somtimes can get very dark in some areas and you have to adjust the brightness level accordingly.Gameplay: The gameplay is great. A great weapons system and the gameplay is easy to pick up on quickly.Storyline: The storyline for the game is awesome as it is modeled after real events of WWII. Right down to storming the beaches of Normandy (which by far is the hardest damn part in the game)Overall: Overall, I think the game is great. It has a few flaws, such as a couple graphic glitches but nothing that can't be overlooked. One of the things I liked best about this game is that it has a lot of variety in the types of things you have to do. Not just shoot the bad guy. You have to steal battle plans, plant explosives, disable vehicles and so on. Very cool.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Return to Castle Wolfenstein. MOH is a great game but it just can't hold up to the level that RTCW is at. I would say that this is the second best FPS I have ever played. RTCW being the best. Both games are great and if you're a fan of FPS or WWII games, either one is a safe bet.", "I recently purchased this first person shooter expecting more of the same run and gun type of action found in dozens of other games. (I lied. I played the demo to death while waiting for this.)  After playing the playstation 2 version, I didnt expect much.  When I finally played the PC version I was literally blown away.  When I seen the depth of the game I knew I had to buy it.  The demo was the most used program on my computer for months.  Now the full game is in my posession and I love it. The PC version is actually a completely different game.  The missions are different as is the character you play. Obviously the game in general is far better than the console version.True, the game has no blood or gratuitous amounts of fleshy, dripping, guts, but the game has style. You will learn that other games with gallons of bright red liquid gushing from enemies when you shoot them is rediculous anyway. There are other means of telling when youve scored a hit like sound and slick model animations.  Also, the graphics are great.  You can hide out in rubble or lush leafy bushes.  The sound is the best.  You can tell where your enemies are by listening for them (you may need a better sound card to support the enviromental audio, but they arent that pricey).  I swear that in multiplayer, I have hunted my friends down by listening to thier boots jogging on the ground.  You can always tell where stuff in the game is by litening to it. You may have to creep with some stealth sometimes, but it all adds to the game.The review stated that the multiplayer is average at best.  The reviewer clearly has to be talking about another game.  This was a mistake, because in my opinion, MOHAA has the best mutliplayer.  It adds the intelectual factor of Ravenshield with a faster paced game.  All of the maps are wonderfully thought out.  Even the smallest, forgotten nooks and crannies, that seem like developers accidents are purposely put in the level for the advantage of whomever hides in there.  There are little spots under rubble or in bushes.  There are so many places to hide out and yet there is never a break in the action.  The maps can be kind of large, but can be played with few or many people.  The game tpyes are fun and have much variety. You will love the sinlge player Omaha beach invasion and you get to recreate that online. The multiplayer is not sub-standard.  In fact, it has to be the most fun FPS deathmatch or teambased game ive played.  This game is so well done, it make many of the games out today look like garbage.  The funny thing is: I dont even like EA Games after being dissapointed with several of their other titles.Buy this game.  If there is anything you will get out of it for sure, it is a sense of appreciation for the most horroble war of all time.  You will feel the emotion in this game.You will feel like you are part of the raw battles of WWII, making adifference.  After playing this game you will run out and watch Saving Private Ryan.  You may also feel the need to research some history on the war.  It makes you feel.  Check it out.", "This game has incredible depth. It spent several nights trying to figure out the right strategy for the situation. I can't wait for an expansion pack to come out!!!", "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault may be the most exciting game I have ever played. The gameplay is quick and fun, and the graphics are great!It is imperitave that you buy this if you are into PC games. You will NOT regret it!", "Ok, you said...EA, make sure a game works before you sell it. I say to you...Make sure your computer can handle a game before you buy it!And about the blood, if you go to alliedassault.com there are blood mods. You can have from drops of blood to tons of blood. Great site for modifications of this game.", "I am a big fan of FPS games but Allied Assault goes beyond shooting at everything you see.  In all missions, there is some degree of strategy and planning required to complete the assignmet.  The graphics are great and the assortment of weapons is perfect for the game. They are all WWII vintage, adding to the realism of the game.  I also like the seemingly unlimited quicksaves. Overall, this is one the best action games I have seen in a long time. Very realistic and not overly violent or gory considering the subject matter. I hope EA will release expansion packs for this game. Great job.", "\"World War 2 is finally made better than it must have seemed! This earns only 4 and a half stars because of how complicated things get. That's the beauty of this game! It has great graphics, realistic, life-like battle scenes, and violence. Just like that movie Black Hawk Down, but it is different. How, you may ask? Because, this was in Germany. That was only in Africa. The beginning of \"\"Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault\"\" is almost like you're in Africa. *Shrugs*. I don't know. It's Germany anyway, but you won't find Hitler anywhere soon. Maybe he shot his eye out with his  Red Ryder 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle, so you don't have to kill him. Oh well.Apparently, I had already played another awesome Medal Of Honor game before, when I thought it was this game.....I was right. It doesn't need blood to be a good army game. It just is. The graphics are cool, the battle is cool, the weapons are cool, the projection room you go into to review a mission after you've completed it is cool....THE WHOLE GAME IS COOL!\"", "If you have a high speed modem you will be playing this until the end of time.  My only complaint would be a lack of multiplayer maps.  But other than that this is a fun game.", "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is arguably the best first person shooter game for the PC. It's two predecessors, Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Underground don't even compare with the gameplay, texture, or graphics that the computer enhances. Allied Assault brings a whole new array of weapons into play. You can control more artillery, and a wide variety of authentic WW2 weapons to help defeat the Nazi war machine. You also get to take place in biggest operation ever: Operation Overlord, a.k.a D-Day. With a lot of help from your allies, the Nazis don't stand a chance of defeating you.The only minor annoyance that I know of is that the enemy is such a good shot. And I'm sure those who have played the sniper level will agree with me.Bottom Line: Medal of Honor does it again", "MOH Allied Assault is a great 1st person shooter game and I really was impresssed with it. Yet I would advise you to read the following so as to decide wether you want to purchase it or not:1. Requires a very fast computer with atleast 256MB Ram, 700Mhz and a Very Very good Video card if you want to really experience the charm of the game.2. Different from the PS2 version. The PS2 Version is way better!!3. Moderate Graphics..Nothing Great!!Similar to the prior MOH games!4. No Blood and no Gore. Takes away the fun of killing the Nazis!!In conclusion if your computer meets the above listed requirments, If you can deal with the moderate graphics and if you can forget blood and gore, GO GET IT BABY!!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.034434206783771515, 0.01735330931842327, 0.04094351828098297, 0.0006172626744955778, 0.0019610256422311068, 0.0006613031146116555, 0.030827121809124947, 0.04314078390598297, 0.06495469808578491, 0.022902915254235268, 0.03768591955304146, 0.003890883643180132, 0.0026812732685357332, 0.06639944761991501, 0.058294396847486496, 0.036459848284721375, 0.04159907251596451, 0.04369087889790535, 0.09899159520864487, 0.08871816843748093, 0.020429469645023346, 0.06279712170362473, 0.027217984199523926, 0.04052647948265076, 0.0779775083065033, 0.0005149441421963274, 0.03432891517877579]]}
