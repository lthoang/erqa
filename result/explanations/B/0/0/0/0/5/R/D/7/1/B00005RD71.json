I'm to retrieve something from a burial cave near a campsite of people who don't like you too much.  Not only was there some flame monster chasing me on the way there that wouldn't leave me alone after I got there, which the camp people didn't help me with.  They wouldn't even sell me potions or anything unless I forked out alot of gold!  Stupid!  The burial cavern is also impossiple!  You have to have magic spells or magic items.  If I would've known that, I would've brought all the ones I had with me!  The creatures in the cave aren't effected by normal weapons.  Not only that, but I'm gonna have to face that fire monster on the way back and may not make it.  Stupid!  You also get effected too much later in the game with blight or other status where you have to keep on taking special potions till you're back to normal.  I understand there should be an element of difficulty in games, but this is overkill!  Not only that, but it takes forever to get anywhere in this game.  There's too much to do and keep track of.  I'd rate the beginning parts/quests 4 stars, but so far I haven't felt like getting back to it, so I'd rate it at most 2 stars where I'm at now.  If you like first person RPGs, I suggest King's Field.  Think they only made those for the PlayStation 1 and 2.  They're about due for another one!To be fair to the game I decided to follow up this review with something I would've written before I got stuck.  The game is pretty inventive and has quite a bit of tasks that will keep you busy.  The only thing is the game seems a bit repetative.  There's not enough variety, and I do agree with one review I read about there not being any waterfalls, bird filled forests, sunrises and sunsets, and other similar visual attractions.  Yes, this game is a bit dark, but isn't bad.  For the time it came out the graphics and sounds aren't bad.  I like the first person view and that you can make it 3rd person to look at your character and she how awesome he/she is with his/her current armor/clothing.In my opinion the positives are:1) You can bribe salespeople so you can buy low and sell high.2) You have free reign with your character creation.  You have quite a bit of options to choose from as far as character origination, class, and specialty.3) There are alot of items you can find in caves, homes, etc.4) You can clean out homes as long as no one is watching.  I find this funny as I can clear people's shelves and take the pillows off their beds. LOL  You can also steal from shop owners.  I stole quite a bit of weapons and armor from someone's chest while peaking around the corner of a village not too far from the one you start in.  Only thing was I had to keep on coming back, because I would get overencumbered.  This really helped me build some money and get some good equipment.  I know it's not good to steal, but this is just a game, and if you don't get caught, why not? LOLIn my opinion the negatives are:1) Later on in the game you get infected with blight, disease, and other status effects too often.  I guess they want me to always carry a bunch of cure potions on me???2) You end up being unprepared for some places you spend alot of time getting to.  I am in one such place now.  I spent alot of time getting there as well as having a flame monster chasing me.  I didn't have what I needed and the people at the camp did not want to help me.  This quest is actually part of the main game.  Casius Cosus, or whatever his name is, tells you to come here to prove you are the chosen one.3) Some things are too repetative:  people say the same things; the caves look the same, I've had the same armor like forever; same enemies except some are blighted, diseased or otherwise; your quests are all the same where you have to go retrieve some item... sometimes you have a hard time finding it4) Your weapons and armor breakdown too fast. Would be nice if they lasted a bit longer or allowed you to repair them yourself. I have repair vices, grips, etc. but the game doesn't allow me to use them for some reason.5) Some of the enemies are way too hard for where you're supposed to be in the game. I was kicking butt until I got to a place that required me to have magic weapons/skills... really stupid. I don't like being forced to have to use magic if I don't have a magic based character. I find that really stupid.6) It takes too long to get to some places, especially if you become overencumbered. I was in one such place in Vivee I believe... took me forever to get there and back and would get overencumbered too quick. Also had enemies there that kept on decreasing my stats thus making me overencumbered too quick anyway. When I learned this, I would save right before facing them, and they kept on re-appearing after I already killed them all. Maybe there's a wizard/sorceror that keeps on calling them up there. Who knows?7) Some towns are way too big and confusing: towns like Vivee. Everything looks the same, and it's easy to get lost. I understand there should be some mazes here and there, but in towns???So all in all as I said originally I give this game 4 stars in the beginning when it's easier to figure things out and things weren't so repetative but 2 stars later on when it gets too boring, repetative, and hard.", "\"Morrowind overall is a decent game, but it has a LOT of things going against it. At times it feels more like a solo MMORPG, and it's not for everyone.Pros:*Plot - This is the only part of the game that I don't find flaw in. The main story is great and there is plenty of amazing lore. This is the part of the game that is worth playing.*Music - Composed by Jeremy Soule, the music is fantastic.*Environment - The island is fantastic and mysterious, with an endless number of neat places to explore.*Graphics - The graphics are great for the time the game was released.*Character Class Customization - Provides you with endless ways to customize your character, though the physical customization is severely lacking.Cons:*Music - Okay, the music itself is amazing. However, it is implemented VERY poorly. Instead of songs tailored to specific aspects of the game, such as a main theme, battle themes and zone themes, there is just a handful of songs that loop throughout the entire game. This greatly cripples the environment and overall feel of the game. For example, in Icewind Dale you have beautiful wind instruments for the peaceful town and bellowing horns for the ruins of a dwarven city. In Morrowind, you have a few themes (including main theme) that loop all the time, and a few battle themes. You can be in a dark, evil Sixth-house cave and hear the gorgeous wind instruments and strings of the main theme playing, which pretty much ruins any sort of immersion. It almost feels like you're listening to a small playlist on iTunes while playing the game.*Environment - While there may be some really well designed areas in this game, it's very repetitive. Once you've seen one cave, shipwreck, grotto, Dwemer ruin, Sixth-house shrine, etc. you've seen them all...and there are a LOT of them. It gets old exploring areas that all look the same. The cities are very similar; with the exception of a few such as Vivec, they are all just a few buildings overloaded with lifeless NPCs.*Battle - The battle is utterly terrible. Magic is generally worthless. You can have a very high destruction skill and your sword will still do triple the damage of one of your destruction spells. Swords aren't much fun, either. Melee consists of constantly spamming the mouse over and over again until it finally hits that huge creature that is practically on top of you. It is just frustrating, not fun. Unlocking doors and disarming traps is the same - you must spam your lock over and over again until it succeeds. Very tedious and very boring.*NPCs/dialogue/quests - They lack personality. Very few of them are memorable. They all feel like clones and most of them say the same thing. The dialogue is a drag and consists of pushing random words/topics on the side and seeing if the response from NPC #135435 is different that the response from NPC #135436. The quests the NPCs give you are generally errand boy quests and are very boring. There is also little reward for doing them, aside from some reputation and gold. Some of them are frustrating and make no sense; for example the empire sends you to assassinate a group of people, but if you kill them first, when you come out the empire arrests you.*Vendors/trainers - Vendors and trainers are a complete drag. There are so many of them and it takes forever to sell anything (they have gold limits and you have to sell to specific vendors, e.g. sell swords to weapons vendor). Returning from a dungeon, it is an absolute pain to try to sell all of the loot you found. This may be fine for some players, but most gamers would be really frustrated with this.*Equipment - Honestly, there is not very much cool armor in this game. Glass armor is neat, and there are some nice weapons, but that's about it. Combined with the fact that most of the \"\"dungeons\"\" (which are mostly small and insignificant) are repeats of one another, the lack of equipment takes away from the desire to explore. You can find the coolest armor very early in the main story, and after that there isn't much motivation to go digging in the clone caves scattered throughout the island.*Enchanting/spell making - Adds a nasty shine to armor that makes it uglier than before. It's also a very tedious profession; you can either pay exorbitant amounts of money to an enchanter or do it yourself with a low success rate. It's overly complex and is more of a pain than it's worth. Spell making is not as fun as it sounds, it mainly consists of combining spells you already know into another worthless spell.*Physical character customization - Lacking, not many ways to change your characters appearance.*Bugs - While a lot of this has been fixed through patches and expansions, the game still has a lot of issues, including frequently getting stuck (in many ways), crashing, lag, etc.Overall, I think that the main story is worth doing and the game is worth buying just for that. It takes a long time to get into and definitely isn't for everyone, though.\"", "I have to say this is one of the best video games I've played.  I've played a few RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, but Morrowind has more of an openended, do-what-you-want D&D; feel than all of them.  The graphics are beautifully rendered, character creation is fun and versatile, and replayability is HUGE.  I intend to replay this game with different characters, various downloaded plugins, and with some of my own plugins (once I take the notion to start fiddling with the construction set that comes with the game).  This game is certainly not for those who like structure and firm story-lines.  There are simply too many things to do and see, and the game really entices you to get sidetracked, which, to me, is one of its strengths.In a nutshell, sound effects and music are good, visuals are state of the art (especially outside), gameplay is engaging (though on occasion some quests become monotonous and one does have to get use to being rather alone in a world of uninspiring NPCs), and the possibilities of the game, thanks to the construction editor, are virtually limitless.One warning: As many have said here, system requirements (that is, what you need to run the game smoothly) are quite high.  This is a game made for tomorrow's computer. Also, many players will experience at least some technical issues with the game (such as crashes and freezes), especially regarding memory management and its over-sensitivity to certain hardware configurations and settings. If you know someone who has the game, it would be a good idea to borrow it and test it on your computer before buying it.  Otherwise, this is a fantastic game that sets a new standard for the role-playing genre.Rating: 4 1/2 stars", "Ladies and gentlemen, I have some terrible news. Morrowind, the third chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga, has proven to be one of the biggest PC let-downs in history. The game is a definitive example of what happens when endless opportunities meet horrible gameplay. By endless opportunities I mean that our good friends at Bethesda Softworks spent countless hours developing an amazingly beautiful and immersive 3d world...one in which you can go anywhere and do almost anything.-Open ended, epic world and events. - Though I did also say horrible gameplay...and Morrowind suffers immeasurably from just that. The fighting system is agonizingly weak. Unless you have a great weapon and awesome abilities with that weapon, you're going to spend a great deal of time getting [beat] by some of the games lowliest creatures.  Also - There are so many spells and enchantments to use that it gets overwhelming trying to remember what does what and how to use it. Not only are the spells too many, but the interface with which to use them is cumbersome and annoying as well. You get stuck in these skirmishes, and you're struggling to attack and switch spells at the same time while your enemy(impossible to outrun) beats you down with little effort. _ Like I said, the world is very beautiful and the characters are amazingly detailed, but all this is lost as the game tries to run before it can walk.  I'm sure geeks with nothing to do with their lives will have a fun time modding this one to death and spending every hour playing it until their character can stand up to the game's foes.  But for the rest of us, crap on that. - - In short, Morrowind's designers tried to stuff 5 pounds worth of greatness into an 11 ounce box.** Too much at once for any gamer who doesn't think an aggravation induced stroke should be part of epic fantasy gameplaying. - Buy at your own risk.", "I don't think I've ever played such a detailed, intense game.  I'm pretty sure I've put in atleast 300 hours playing this game.  Now the only downside I found was when I brought up the screen for the map, sometimes it froze.  So make sure you save often.  This game is great!!  You can interact with all the characters and pretty much go where ever you want.  I really don't know what else to say about this game except that it's probably one of the best I've ever played.", "\"\"\"Morrowind\"\" is a wonderful game.  Except for the mediocre combat, this game is everything that a role-playing experience should be.  There is no multiplayer game (thank goodness), which means that all of the attention goes into single player.  When I think of great RPG's, I think of \"\"Fallout\"\", \"\"Baldurs Gate 2\"\", and now \"\"Morrowind\"\".What makes this game so great is the huge world of Morrowind, and the unbelievable attention to detail.  There is a lot more to this game than just being beautiful to look at.  You could wander around in Morrowind forever, off of the path of the main quests in the game.  There are countless little side quests and miniature areas to kill monsters and pick up loot.  I spent probably 10-15 hours simply wandering around the first little town in the game before beginning the main quest.  Every room has a bunch of little objects in it that you can interact with.  If you want, you can pick up books off the shelves and read them, or you can pick up little knickknacks, like the silverware .  Most of the books are non-essential to the game itself, but they are entertaining to read, and they add depth and flavor to the game.  The NPC's have more to say than the usual computer game NPC's, although they do repeat themselves quite a bit (that happens in every game).The role-playing system for this game also presents endless variety.  There are a lot of different character classes to choose from, and many different character abilities.  You hone your skills by using them, or paying someone to train you, instead of the usual system of assigning skill points.  If you want to develop your character a certain way, you have to use those skills as often as possible, even if it means the risk of getting killed.  I played a character with a bow and a melee weapon, so I made sure to keep switching back and forth between the two weapons.  I also made sure to include magic and backstabbing, so that I could keep my magic and sneaking skills up to par.  Paying someone to train you is expensive, but you can make it cheaper by getting on their friendly side in some way.In the spirit of a true RPG, there are different ways to solve every problem.  \"\"Morrowind\"\" offers seemingly unlimited replayability.  In one example, I needed an expensive item from a shop to complete a quest.  So, I mixed up a telekinesis potion, and then stole the item off of a shelf from a distance so that I wouldn't get caught.The interface for this game is very good.  Pop-up tool tips provide information wherever you need it, and it only takes a few mouse clicks to get most tasks done.  The only problems with the interface are the tiny, microscopic inventory icons.  The inventory icons in this are game so puny that you can't tell what anything is without moving the mouse pointer over it.  A sword looks like a dagger, and a bow looks like a tiny stick.  A gauntlet or breastplate just looks like a little blob.  This is a neglected part of the game.So, that leaves us with combat -- the weakest part of this game.  One of the problems with combat is that there seem to be only about 10-15 different types of opponents to fight in the game.  The combat does have strategy built into it -- you have to fight with your character's strengths.  For instance, I had a weak melee character, so I got through tough battles by summoning beasts to fight, and then picking off the enemies from a distance.  However, the visual and sound effects stink.  The enemy has a health meter, but there is no indication of how many hit points of damage you are doing.  Your character simply pokes or hacks away at the enemy with little chops or stabs.  A hit doesn't look any different from a miss, except for the little red cloud that poofs up for a moment (I assume that's supposed to be blood?)  You don't see the weapon actually make contact with the enemy.  The only sounds that come from a hit are a cheesy \"\"smack\"\" sound and maybe a moan from the monster.  The hit sound sounds like something you would hear in a cartoon when someone gets hit with a pie in the face.Another downer with the game is the lack of voice-acted dialog lines.  The only voice acted parts of this game are greetings and battle taunts.  That's why there are no memorable NPC's in this game at all.In my opinion, this is a can't-miss, 5-Star game for those of you who just love role-playing games.  \"\"Morrowind\"\" is not a \"\"something for everyone\"\" game though, so if you are not a big RPG fan, then you might find it to be kind of dull.\"", "First off, let me state this. This game is not for simple minded people. You must bare some intelligence and some roleplaying know how. If you want a standard diablo clone go after neverwinter nights (ok the dm thing is cool but the combat!). If you want a real rpg this is where it's at.In the land of morrowind you play a released prisoner, you can do sevearl things when you reach the land. Become a guard, explore vast lands, do quests, or find out your mysterious release. There is one main story and about  400 other side quests just as engrossing. You can specialize in whatever you want, a wizard rogue, or a warrior knight it's up to you.The graphics, sound, exploration all come together beautifully, maybe the best in a game yet.The game does get boring, but then you shrug it off and you continue on your path towards self destruction.A MUST BUY FOR SERIOUS, INTELLIGENT GAMERS.", "\"Please keep in mind this review was written when the game was first released, before any patches or even mods were released.  The game is obviously quite a bit different now and would get a higher score from me certainly.Morrowind, the 3rd installment of the Daggerfall series from Bethesda Software promised to be the first open-ended single player RPG game in a fully immersive 3D environment with cutting edge graphics, length and depth.Well, they got the cutting edge graphics part right apparently.The character development system is excellent, plenty of options to choose from in the areas of magic, melee and ranged combat, and classes/races.  This promising, involved character creation system is intuitive, deep and fun to play around with by itself.Once you've landed in the first town and are introduced to the reason you've been chosen by the Emperor and are allowed to enter the outside world, it can be a bit over-whelming and confusing - the game is very open-ended.You can pretty much do anything you want, buy some stuff, kill someone or something, sneak, steal, barter, join a guild, accept a quest from an NPC who gives you one etc.., or you can just run around the world at your leisure.The frustrating and ultimately disappointing aspect of the game is how incredibly tedious and boring the game becomes after you've gotten more than halfway through the main quest, where the game reveals just how shallow it really is.The vendors never carry much money, so finding expensive items means absolutely nothing at all.There are only 3-5 suits of armor or types of clothing any character in the game can wear, along with one or two special suits you can only find in certain areas and after completing certain quests.  This simply adds to the tedium, wearing the same stuff for over 4-5 levels or more at a time.It can take up to 15 minutes or more to travel from one area to another.  And the landscape is barren, boring, and repetitive, despite the hand-placed items. Everything looks the same.On top of that there are only 3-4 monsters you will do battle with 90% of the time in the game, and you get really, really tired of combating the same monsters over and over and over for 100 hours (which is what it takes to finish the game and really complete most of the quests).  If I see or hear another Cliff Racer I'm going to puke, seriously.  The difficulty level of these enemies never changes, they are always the same. And certain areas don't offer harder challenges than others unless you \"\"want\"\" to wander into a ruin, and those are of all the same difficulty level as well, no matter where you are in the game.Around level 22, as a Nord Warrior specializing in long blades, I could kill everything and everyone in the game with little problem at all, and I hadn't even finished the main quest yet - still had at least 10 or more hours to go, at least, to finish. This was horribly designed, there were no challenges left, just errand running and talking to the same people over and over.Magic and Thief characters add some depth and much-needed complexity to the game, but they get old fast and their lack of combat ability can be frustrating, ecspecially early on.  You can collect and steal tons of different little odds and ends, but it gets so boring and useless that it's easy to give up after doing it for hours on end.Despite these major problems (similar to my complaints of MMORPG's) the game is very entertaining and fun because of it's explorative nature at first, at least the first 40-50 hours, making it worthwhile at least.But once you've tried and done everything for the most part, there's simply nothing more there, it gets old quick and I really can't see myself playing it again any time soon.Finally the system requirements are incredibly high and it didn't run all that well even on my 1GHZ/Geforce3 rig, but at high detail it ran more than adequately.  The load times are annoying and constant also.Simply another hyped RPG that is just a single player version of Asheron's Call, EverQuest or Anarchy Online.  And like most RPG's of late, boring and tedious despite the intrictate story line and world politics that push you along.If you are a hardcore PC game lover, I'd recommend it, but if you are not, take a pass, ecspecially if your PC is less than ideal for these high end games.\"", "\"Like others reading these reviews, I came late to the game.  I'm past the hard-cord crowd, by a few years, looking through some of the older fare in an attempt to see what good has come before.  I love the RPG genre, and as someone with absolutely no interest whatsoever in the MMO craze, I'm always eager for a good single-player RPG.  Sadly, Morrowind did not fulfill my interest.I think, most importantly, I would've been better off going into it if I had known that the intent of the game is be as open-ended as possible.  As possible as it can manage, to the point that it's difficult to say if there was a plot (I didn't last long enough in the game to find out).This, in turn, is compounded by some of the minor in-game frustrations I encountered.  A big one being that it takes forever to do anything.  This, of course, is due in part to the fact that the world you are in is absolutely massive.  Unfortunately, it's also due to the fact that the avatar moves at a rather slow pace - even when running.  And unfortunately, the \"\"side-quests\"\" are usually more of the fetch-quest fare, that have no background or plot; just minimal, plodding progression.  I've played games where it took hours to do one task and was invigorated.  When it took me hours to get one thing done in this game, I just felt 3 hours older.It also doesn't help that combat itself tends to be a frustration.  You can equip yourself with a weapon and literally sit there clicking the mouse like crazy trying to hit whatever is attacking you and there seems to be complete randomization as to whether or not you actually hit or miss - though miss greatly tends to outweigh to hit and up the frustration factor.  In general, I love real-time battle so much more than turn-based...but even real-time battle needs rules.  This game feels like its creators were too lazy to think up any.A personal, aesthetic criticism is that I'm not a fan of the first-person perspective.  True, you can play through the game third-person, but it becomes almost impossible to see your attackers in combat and so is practically useless to do so.The environment, of course, is fantastic.  The graphics aren't the prettiest, in my opinion, but they do rather fit the atmosphere of the game in an odd way.  There's a rather dour feeling to the whole experience, and everything from the absolutely outstanding soundtrack to the incredible in-game design, and the 360 degree sound alone is almost engaging enough to keep interest in the game despite its lack of immediate story presentation.Where this game really excels is the customization.  I think that and the extreme non-linear aspects are what would greatly appeal to a particular crowd of RPG fans.  There's so many different ways to alter your character - both in the initial creation, but also significantly over the course of the game.  If you run and swim enough, your athletics will increase; if you use combat more than magic, you'll become more proficient at melee combat, etc.  It really is geared toward ultimately creating a unique character that fits your style.Unfortunately, it just couldn't keep my interest.  Over 20 hours into the game, I had made little progress, and encountered not even a hint of there being a plot.  And so I just rather stopped caring and gave up.  I love side-quests as much as the next RPG fan, but I find myself more interested in the overall process if there's a bit more linearity or structure - even a side-story to add to the overall experience would've been something.This was my first foray into the Elder Scrolls saga - I have yet to try Oblivion - but it does rather dampen my interest.  I respect and understand that customization and non-linearity will appeal to some RPG fans; but for me, personally, I like there to be a little more meat on the bones.\"", "Imagine your perfect epic RPG where you see directly what the character sees. What would your perfect RPG have, would you want to be a guard, soldier, warrior, adventurer, pilgrim, healer, mage, sorcerer, wizard, thief, murderer, thug, miner, killer, vampire, demon, unimaginable creature, should I keep going? You can be anything and everything with one character in this game. Would this game have you helping others, defeating enemies (there are some amazingly creative ideas for creatures), selling goods, ruling a kingdom, going treasure hunting, tomb raiding, dragon slaying, charting undiscovered lands, casting spells, making spells, making weapons, fixing armor, enchanting objects, stealing souls, flying, swimming, swinging axes, staffs, swords, hammers, spears, throwing daggers stars or shooting bow and arrows from a distance. This game has it all, and the more you do something, the more you get skilled at what you do. If you swing a sword to defeat every enemy you will become a great swordsman, if you use magic to destroy everything, you will become a great mage, if you hide yourself you will become a great ninja, if you constantly pick locks you become an expert in security, when you run around you become a better athlete, when you jump around you become a better acrobat, and when you take some damage to your armor, clothes or skin you get better in heavy armor, light armor or medium armor. That's how the game works there is no structure, you can become an invincible force. So why is there a main quest if you can do anything? Because there are 350 mini quests! You do not have to do them all, in fact you do not have to do any of them and the quests vary from deliver this message, kill the rats in my attic, take me to this city to the more challenging slay this dragon, eliminate the enter thieves guild, assassinate the emperor. Your actions dictate this RPG, you begin on a minor quest (which leads to the real quest of the game) if you steal something, you are arrested and must pay a fine or go to jail, if you free slaves expect the owner to be angry, if you prove your love, expect to get some love, if you tease someone expect for that person to hate you, and if you kill someone you are feared heavily by the public! This game is anything you would like it to be, but the only catch is this game does require quite a super computer, at least more than 1.4 gHz.", "\"Before writing a review for a game, I usually either finish it (for the good ones) or deem it unplayable (for the bad ones).  These people who write reviews before ever having played the game sort of boggle my mind a little.Anyway, I was all set to buy this game for my Xbox as I knew it was going to be a resource hog, one that my aging PC was unlikely unable to push.  To make a long story short, I ended up getting the PC version for three reasons; 1. It came out weeks before the Xbox version (weeks mean years for those of the short attention span), 2. it has a massive campaign editor and construction set, 3. because of 2., there are going to be lots of official and unofficial add-ons and plug ins, one of which I've already downloaded.Always give bad news first: This game is the resource hog I feared it would be.  If your running anything less than the best, prepared to either upgrade or lag.  My PC has a 1 ghz processor, 512 megs of RAM, Soundblaster Live Platium, and an old 32 meg Geforce2.  I was able to play the game reasonably well at 1024 x 768, but it was nothing to write home about.  The performance was poor at best, especially in the out of doors.  The graphics look pretty lame at this \"\"low\"\" resolution and those sophisticated textures look like poo-poo at anything less than 1600 x 1200.  Fortunately, I found a 64 meg Radeon 7500 video card a couple of days ago REALLY cheap, and decided to go with it.  This has helped immensely.  I can now go as high as my monitor will allow (1600 x 1200) and the graphics look much better. I still experience some lag outside, but the performance is MUCH better.  If you don't have a beast, can't afford to upgrade and own an XBOX, I advise you to get the Xbox version and save yourself a lot of headaches.More complaints: Morrowind has some very irritating little glitches that cause you to get stuck behind stuff, on the sides of hills, between objects, etc.  The movement is pretty clunky to begin with, which is further hindered by your characters attributes.  There have been several instances where I've had to revert to a previous save because of this whihc can be absolutely maddening.  Save often and be prepared for this one, it's one of my biggest complaints.Ok, a few more random complaints and then I'll get to the good stuff.  The interface as a whole will take some getting used too.  I still don't like the inventory menu with the teeny tiny little items that you couldn't possibly tell apart if not for the pop-up windows.  Also, be prepared to do a lot of wandering around aimlessly to find certain buildings and items.  When a NPC sends you on a quest, he updates your journal with text based instructions (if you think to ask for them) and doesn't update your map for you.  The map is so huge, that it can take awhile to get where you're going.  Also, I tried walking from one city to another with my first character: big mistake.  It took forever and I never did get there.  The scale on the game is huge, this is a good thing and a bad thing.  Get attacked, start running for your life, and the next thing you know you're lost.  There are signs posted here and there, but somtimes you can get way off track before you find a new one.  Also, no multiplayer, 'nuff said there.Ok, now for the good stuff: this game boasts what may be the largest, most detailed simulated world ever created.  Just wandering around gives you a sense of awe an immensity unlike any game I've ever played before, including Everquest.  The rich textures, huge mountains and detailed terrain must be experienced in the finest detail possible, or quite frankly, you aren't getting your money's worth.  While games like Baldur's Gate rely on strong story to create a compelling world worth returning too, Morrowind doesn't really have too.  From the moment you step off the boat, you're there.  Fortunately, Morrowind's beautiful world is supported by a strong story.  Like any RPG worth its salt there are hundreds possibly thousands of quests, mini-quests and hidden details that make the most mundane walk through the swamps worth your while.  The style and look of the game is just breathtaking, and honestly like nothing I've ever seen before.  It is equal parts weird and amazing.  Bottom line: it's an incredible world worth exploring which will be directly affected by your actions (unlike those Everqust type games).One of the things I liked immediately is the character creation process, which you can do one of several ways.  First, you pick a race, some of which are fantasy staples, like elves and orcs, but also includes a race of cat people and lizard men that look really cool.  Once you've chosen your race, you can choose class by either answering a few simple questions that will determine your class by gaging your (or your characters) personality and preferences; you can choose a class from the list (there are lots of classes); or you can create your own custom class.  These options really provide a lot of diversity.  I test drove a couple of characters from various methods before settling on the one I use now.It takes a while for the game to get going, but once you build up some momentum, it is incredibly fun.  Save often in the beginning as even the peons will be taking you out, or so it will seem.  Finding a character that fits your playing style is almost as fun and challenging as the game itself.  There is so much variety between races and characters it is unbelievable.  I'm so glad I bought the new video card and didn't give up on this game after the first couple of days.  If you've got a system that exceeds the recommended requirements and are patient, you will be rewarded.  With all its flaws (hopefully a patch will remedy most of them) this game is worth your while.  It is a true achievement.\"", "\"I almost feel like I shouldn't write a review of this game, because I just don't know where to begin or how to say all that I want to say. This game is by far the greatest RPG I've ever played. It is big and sprawling and almost literally allows you to do anything you want. After the character creation process and the initial 'start' of the game, you walk outside and are free to go *anywhere* and do *anything* you want. You don't even have to pursue the main game, and there will still be 100+ hours of things to do.I played this game for several months non-stop and never once got tired of it. Even now, a few years later, I still have memories of doing things in the game that are so vivid that I feel like I've been there myself and actually *did* do those things.A quick anecdote: I was used to playing console RPGs (old-school types, like Breath of Fire, etc.) in which everything was linear, and you (and everyone else who played the game) had to progress at the same pace and in the same way. This meant if you came to a river, you'd have to wait until you found the 'boat' or 'canoe' and then you'd have access to that part of the map. In Morrowind, I chose to play as a mage, and one of my starting spells was \"\"Waterwalking\"\". I didn't know what to make of this at first, but then I used it and my character was walking across the water! I wasn't used to having that kind of ability right at the start of the game, but that's what makes this game so great -- you can do virtually anything, and at your own pace.The world is huge and the cities you can visit are numerous. You can spend time in each one almost as if you were in a real city and you were touring it (especially Vivec).The expansions are good also, but naturally they aren't as large as the original game.Just an amazing, unbelievable experience.\"", "I got Morrowind on a whim after reading some good reviews. I was impressed right from the start and it only got better.Morrowind, simply put, does everything right for an RPG. Most everything about the gameplay seems natural. Skills for example increase based on usage rather than using arbitrary skill points. I really enjoyed the amount of freedom the player has in almost anything the player can do. From enchanting custom items, to the methods used to complete quests or even not do any quests at all and just wondering around leveling up. The range of options made available to the player is amazing. You are not &quot;required&quot; to do things a certain way or even do anything at all. I played the main quest from start to finish. Then I started over and chose to ignore it and joined another faction. There was still plenty to do and see, and some things I didn't see the first time, with out having anything at all to do with the main quest or story. I still feel like I have only done a tenth of what there is to do in this game. This is a massively single player role-playing game.One thing that stood out was that Morrowind has a unique look and feel. This comes from having a large and original story. Nothing is based on D&amp;D rules. Races and characters all fit in to Morrowind's elaborately crafted world. You can spend a lot of time studying the many books in the game to just learn the history of Morrowind. This is all represented with some impressive graphics. Visually the game is very appealing. My favorite is the sky at night. You can see very detailed stars through the wisps of animated clouds that nothing at all like a skybox. You could write a book on the many fine details found in the game that all help it seem living world and not a static backdrop made for the player.If the game has flaws it's that there are still some things that seem unfinished. There are too few ambient sounds, making most places oddly silent and empty. The number of monsters to fight is limited to a dozen constantly reused models. NPCs will stand around in the same general area day or night. Enter a diamond mine and you find miners but you will never see them mining anything. These things detract from what is otherwise a very immersive game. It seems odd that these things could not have been improved before release.Yet these things in no way stop it from being a very good game with a seemingly limitless number of quests to do and a huge range of options for the player.", "I love the game. I really do. I love being able to do whatever I want. The game has flaws. One major flaw is crashing. The game has just closed out 50 times. It happens a lot. The game just closes out. No big deal if I remember to save a ton.The game has open-ended stuff. You can steal anything. There are tons of things to look at. There are also alot of different subfields of things. Alchemy, Quests, and tons of land to explore. The game though feels a little lonely. Morrowind doesn't have a lot of people once you look at it all. There are mods though. There is one mod at morrowind summit which drops in people all over the place. The mod requires both expansions and another mod but works well. As for the quests, fun. There are quests where you go to dungeons but there are quests where you get to do other stuff. Still, a lot of the time you will be in vast lands by yourself.Graphics are great. The water looks fantastic and there are tons of different things you can pick up but they all have their own models. Although monsters sometimes walk like idiots, they are fine.Actually, the game does have one awesome feature that you won't find in alot of other games. A construction set lets you do whatever you want. There are thousands of mods and little features people have created already. Morrowind Summit has alot. I would reccomend the predator mod which just rocks, but is big.Overall this game is fine. The loneliness and everything else can be solved with mods. -Though it can be boring when you can't walk a while without being attacked by some stupid monster like a cliff racer.- The game has it's high points and lows. I would reccomend it though over the Xbox version as the mods are exclusive to pc. There is no multiplayer, but if there were it would probably cost money. It's cheap now, and that really makes it a good deal.", "\"Morrowind starts you off in some pathetic one horse town and says \"\"Go do whatever you want, we don't care.\"\"  And that's what makes this game an instant hit.  The actions you take have consequences, you have complete freedom to roam wherever you want, and there's plenty of treasure to find to encourage your curiosity.  The graphics are high end (although they have suffered with age) and the lore is plentiful.  The design of the island is also mesmerizing.  You can walk through a wet marsh, sandy desert, or a massive city.The downsides to this game come down to the combat, voice acting, and amount of characters.  The combat usually comes down to frantic clicking and it can be tiresome at first as you hear a \"\"wiff\"\" noise every time you miss.  As you level up your combat, this problem goes away.  The voice acting is hardly there and you're forced to read through a massive amount of text to get anywhere.  And lastly, you'll be walking through a bustling city with nary a person around.  Considering the limitations at the time period, I don't think these things are that negative.  It just may throw off a modern gamer.However, for myself, I still find myself drawn to the complete freedom and wonder that permeates Morrowind.  Getting this will be the best choice of your life!\"", "I honestly do not see what everyone else does in this game. I bought it based on the all the tremendous hype it received. I was really excited about the game when I first played it, but within a week of installing it, I realized that it just wasn't all it was made up to be by all the hype.The world is expansive, yes. In fact, its overwhelming. The landscapes look great and the enviornmental and weather effects are amazing. The problem with this gigantic world is that it is sparsely populated. You only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons. Most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited. And that makes the game lonely. In fact, this game is like playing Ever Quests and other similar massive online games...except you are the only player. There is no one else. And that gets lonely. Why a multi-player option was not included is beyond comprehension.The character models are quite possibly the ugliest character models I have ever seen in a game. The faces are hideous, and all the models look deformed and blocky. This is not because of a system configuration (my computer running top of the line hardware), it is just horrible character design. Further adding to the feeling of repetition, there are only about 5 or 6 different faces per race, further split up between gender. So, with hundreds of NPC's in the game, you see the same faces repeated...ALOT. Not only are all the faces and character models virtually identical, but they all repeat the same text over and over. Although there is a long and involved story in the game, I could never follow it. I didn't find it interesting at all, and frankly, since every character said virtually the same thing, after a while I just found myself not really caring what NPC's said. I ignored them completely. That made the game utterly boring. Maybe its my own fault, but I honestly just got sick of reading the same text over and over from the repetetive NPCs.Creating your character is probably the only entertaining thing about this game. You have the option to pick a pre-existing class, have a custom class created for you by answering questions, or creating your very own class, mixing any abilities that you wish. There are multiple races to choose from, each having unique abilities that set them apart from one another. Picking your appearence is pointless, simply because there aren't many choices, and they all look the same. Plus, you'll see whatever face you pick for yourself repeated over and over in the game on the NPCs, as I mentioned earlier.Upping your skills in the game is simple enough, though it takes hours and hours. If you have the time--and high boredom threshold--you could stand in one spot using your skills over and over and get them up. Using your skills over and over is the only way to advance them, and until you find heavy combat areas, you wont advance much at all.Despite the amazing environmental graphics and weather effects, great ambient sound and sense of exploration, Morrowind just doesn't really cut it. I found the music to be repetetive and dull. There is alot to do in the game, but quests just seem so empty. Of the few quests that I did, I never once got a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. In the end it just felt like more mundane tasks to do, and that made it boring.The heavily touted World Editor allows you to do all types of things, editing almost anything about the game.  You could build your very own world if you had the time and patience.  Oh, and did I mention you need a degree in Quantum Physics to even comprehend how complex the editor is?  Only die-hard, heavily devoted users who would forsake everything else in their life and spend countless hours, days, even weeks trying to learn and master the editor should bother with it.  It is definitely not for the casual editor, or someone with a remote interest in tinkering with the game.If you have countless hours to devote to this game, then you might find it enjoyable. Frankly, I just do not have the time or patience to devote to the game...and it quite simply does not live up in any way to the tremendous hype it received. If the game DID live up to its hype, then I would enjoy it...then I would find the time to devote to this game. In the end, I found it to be nothing more than a repetetive, boring, and dreary gameplay experience. Morrowind should only be played by fanatic, hardcore RPG players. Casual gamers should stay away.", "--Written as Newspaper review in 2002(released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007).  For whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site.Morrowind, one of the largest RPGs (role playing games) I've seen, stands in line to revolutionize console gaming.  Although Morrowind has been released on the PC, I think it is a much more important game in regards to console gaming.RPG games have had a distinct and varied history.  Ranging from the Ultima series of the 1980s to the Zelda franchise to the PC games such as Everquest and Diablo, RPGs have proven very popular.  There are two main types of RPGs.The first one, which has found a very long life in consoles, is the closed-ended RPGs where you have a very clear plot to follow and there's not much getting away from that plot.  The immensely popular Final Fantasy games are excellent examples of this, as well as the Zelda games.The second type, which Morrowind falls under, is a very open-ended game, where the game focuses more on giving you the freedom to play whatever character you would like.  Everquest and Baldur's Gate are good examples of these.  These games focus much more on the `role playing' element instead of a fantasy plot that the game moves you through.  These games are mostly found on the computer.Morrowind is a mixture of both types.  It does have a main plot to attend too; however, Morrowind sets you in such an expansive environment with such a wide variety of things to do that you can play for a very long time without ever touching the main plot.  Morrowind takes the best of both RPG genres (the ability to do whatever you want; having a very good plot) and succeeds wonderfully at doing so.What makes Morrowind such a revolutionary game is actually just the format it is released in.  Console gaming does not have to many of the open-ended RPGs that the computer has.  Console RPGs focus much more on the plot-oriented games instead of giving you freedom to play how you wish.  With Morrowind released on the X-Box, console gamers get a taste of what PC gamers have been experiencing for years.  Hopefully, this trend will continue and console gaming will start getting their share of the open-end games, which (to me and many others) brings much more depth to RPGs tha closed ended games can offer.The best feature Morrowind has to offer is the sheer freedom to do whatever you want.  Like the RPGs you play with dice and a gaming master, Morrowind has you decide what kind of character you want to play based off skills and strong suites.There are ten races to choose from, ranging from Orcs to three different races of Elves to three human species and then to the Argonians (a lizard type species) and Khajiits (a cat race).  Do you want to be a mage or a thief?  Or an assasain?  Do you want to play a moral character such as a knight or a monk?  Do you want to play the part of a barbarian or an elegant businessman?  Or do you want to be a religious pilgrim?The sheer diversity and replayability of Morrowind is astounding because of how many different type characters you can play.  Bethseda (Morrowind's studio) was creative enough in this game to make it possible where you can spend more time on all the other missions to do than on the main plot itself.  How you play is up to you.  My character?  He's an assassin.  A person you watch out for because he is both very stealthy and, if he were ever caught, have a very long criminal record.  But he'll never be caught.", "\"WOW, a game that lets you do anything that you want. You have probably heard this before but this game is HUGE, with fabulous graphics. It does have some problems though I'll get them out of the way first.1. Now you probably thing that I am going to complain about the system requirements, but im not. That is because I have a 2 gigahert p4 computer with a 64 ram geforce 2 Mx video card and the game runs fine, it doesnt slow down at all. What is does do is crash about every 5 hours, but im patient enough to just start it back up again. I'm sure this will be fixed in a patch in the future2.This game has bugs, you might want to wait until the game gets more stable before you buy it. While most bugs are mild, some are medium to spicy. The worst one involved the game not responding when I clicked on any inventory items to use them, but restarting the game fixed it.3.Maybe a bit too unlinear for some, for those that like to be guided in a game you might find yourselve lost. Some people have to have a answer to the question \"\"What do I do in this game\"\"?I got over those problems the minute I fell into the world of Vvardenfell. There is a main quest in this game and I encourage you to follow it, but take a break from it and do one of the hundreds of side quest to get some good money. You can kill anyone you want but if a guard sees you kill a innocent. You will be under arrest, at which you can either pay a fee, go to jail, or resist arrest and start killing everybody. The choosing is up to you. Sorry, im going back to playing the game. Bye everybody\"", "Now that was a good game.  It had decent music, decent graphics for its time, and the characters you chose looked beautiful.  This is so so in my opinion, as it is not enough better from what I've seen to warrant an overhaul of your machine (you need a Pentium 3 or more, a dvd-rom, and everything else to work well; Daggerfall ran on WIndows 95/98).  I managed to get it to run even without the dvd-rom, but I wasn't really impressed.  That all considered, the controls are harder to maneuver (since I didn't have a manual, I had a tough time figuring out how to talk to people), and they scrapped the default design from Daggerfall, so you have to move forward using alphanumerics instead of cursor keys.  If you have a manual, and you have the specifications, it might be worth your while.  Given the choice, though, I'd rather purchase Daggerfall again. I just found out that even though XP generally forbids Daggerfall, if you are unlucky enough to have XP and not have capacity to run Morrowind, go type in Daggerfall XP patch into the search engine to reconfigure the system. I think the deal is that it's illegal to have both on your computer, so if you have Morrowind capacity (I hate you), you shouldn't install this patch.", "Introduction: Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind might require a P3/500MHZ with 128 MB OF RAM for Win9k and 256 MB OF RAM for Win2k, and more but don't listen to the requirements. Even on a p4/1700mhz with 256 or 512 mb of ram, win2k and more the game doesn't run smooth. IT needs a very powerful system to run smooth. Besides the technical part, morrowind offers extremely open ended game play. There are so manys things you can do in the game it is redicoulous. You can literally be anything you want and can do anything you want. There are hundreds of massive locations you can explore in the game. You can spend year after year on a game like this and you woudn't get bored. It is really incredible. Truly, it is a masterpiece. Here is the score:Graphics:Decent. Not Excellent, not Perfect, but good enough. It offers advanced terrain scenery. Indoor and outdoor scenery is certainly fineley designed. The Dynamic Lightning system and the real-time shadows are very good. The high polygon accounts and realistic textures and objects throughout the game and so on are incredible. Although the animations of the characters are done cheesy from my opinion. Graphics score: 7.8/10Audio:Very Good. I'm going to start out with the music. The music is excellent, it suits the theme of the game. When you are exploring a huge mountain or city and so on when you here that classical exploration music or when you are in an intense battle with a creature in morrowind the music really makes you feel like your there. Sounds? They are OK. They suit the game well. Ambient Sounds and triggered/scripted sounds are done well and are decent. Voice acting is very good. Sound score: 8.5/10AI:Damn tough. Nothing too special, but damn tough. The AI is very good ans use good tactics in the game. It is very realistic to watch AI at work in the game. The AI is one of the most spectacular done elements in morrowind. AI score: 9.0/10Game play:Extremely open ended. Done perfectly. Offers what no RPG ever has. You can literally do anything you want. And it is quite realistic in the game with the game play elements. That's all I can describe it. The game play will have you playing the game for years, year after year. I assure you. Game play rating: 10/10.Storyline:Well, the storyline is quite interesting in morrowind. I won't ruin it (meaning I won't say it), but I'm sure it'll grab RPG gamer's interest for sure! Storyline score: 8.8/10Overall final grand score:9.0/10Final word:Morrowind is an superb RPG stragedy over all. It offers vast elements not found in normal games. I suggest this game for any gamer with a powerful enough system to run it and that are fans of this time genre game :)", "\"Morrowind is basically a world.  If you can think of something you'd like to do in Morrowind, chances are there's a way to do it.  Jump from a rain barrel to a rooftop to escape pursuing guards.  Poke around in the bushes outside of town and discover a hidden crypt filled with ghouls.  Paddle out into the ocean, fire an arrow at a giant jellyfish, and high-tail it back into town so the militia will protect you.  There is a lot of fun to be had in this entirely 3-D world.  That said, of course, there are some rather serious bugs that still haven't been corrected.1)  The most egregious I've encountered is the disappearing item bug.  Basically things in your inventory simply vanish.  Sometimes it's so minor you never notice.  Other times, it's a gem worth 15,000 gold.  Then, you notice.  At first I just assumed my naive 20th level guy was just a constant victim of pickpockets.  Then the suit of chainmail he was _wearing_ simply vanished while he was walking down the middle of an empty road.  I reversed course back into town and tried to buy another one from the local guard.  Since I had joined the Imperial Legion, no one would talk to me since I was now \"\"out of uniform.\"\"  Finally I found a non-Legion shop that carried Legion chainmail, bought a suit, and put it on.  The game crashed.  Reloaded, tried again.  Game crashed again.  Finally I just gave up on either being in the Legion, or ever having a Legionnaire NPC ever talk to me again (still out of uniform).2)  Ranged combat is bizarre.  For anyone used to 1st person shooters, using a bow and arrow and crosshairs to peg a target shouldn't be too challenging, but it still requires some coordination and timing, particularly when that target is trying to sneak up and kill you.  However, it's not enough to simply line up something with your bow and shoot it.  You have to ALSO \"\"hit\"\" it with your stats.  So if your character is bad with a bow, you can fire longbow arrows directly through people's heads on screen and not hit them.  Doesn't matter how big and lumbering the target is, if your stats say you miss, you miss, even if you see that arrow go right through its chest.3)  If you start the game and just barter with the first shopkeeper you find for about an hour, you'll soon be able to turn a huge profit just selling him back the items you buy from him.  So whenever you need money, you can just swap the same expensive item back and forth a few times to clean out the house.  Then you can use the money to just train yourself up levels.4)  Unpredictable NPCs.  A lot of the time, fairly innocent things will turn NPCs aggressive.  On the plus side, the guards will usually let you go with a minor fee/bribe, but it can get annoying fast, particularly when all the NPCs are \"\"linked\"\" so that if you [irritate] one, someone on the other side of town somehow magically senses it and runs over with their axe.  A classic example is opening a chest 3 floors above any NPC, then heading downstairs into a swirling pack of angry people.  Then when you kill them all, you're the bad guy, heh.All in all, it's a visually stunning game that can prove to be very frustrating in play.  I find I can only take it for an hour or two at a time.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0028693394269794226, 0.026178525760769844, 0.002259740373119712, 0.003348028054460883, 0.0704856738448143, 0.0010764081962406635, 0.08414845913648605, 0.0018544896738603711, 0.016977734863758087, 0.10896658152341843, 0.1109648123383522, 0.002657898236066103, 0.0017635913100093603, 0.03081393800675869, 0.06341686099767685, 0.015575800091028214, 0.08761128038167953, 0.16428238153457642, 0.11272388696670532, 0.002381508005782962, 0.08964302390813828]]}
