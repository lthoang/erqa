However, growing up in the early 90's, the Super Nintendo version of Link to the Past will be the one I will have fond memories of and cherish the most.  Any updates are just that- updates for all the young people out there who weren't around when the classics were being released.  With that said, either version is a nice addition to your video game library.  Grab some hearts, battle some classic bosses, and have a ball.  The adventure of a lifetime is back.", "\"The Gameboy Advance is becoming a great venue for older games to find a new audience, and by far the best is \"\"Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\"\". This was the first game I played for the Super Nintendo, back in 1991 I think it was, and I could not be happier to play it again.You assume the role of Link, a young warrior who has a telepathic connection to Princess Zelda, who has been kidnapped by an evil Wizard who plans to plunge the land of Hyrule into darkness. You must go through many different stages, solve many different puzzles, and battle a wide array of monsters. This is as good as Zelda gets, and it hasn't been done better since. While \"\"Ocarina of Time\"\" was excellent, this is still by far the best in the series. Everything about it is perfect, the graphics and music are still great, and the role-playing elements keep the gamer hooked for hours. I rarely see a newer game that matches this one.Every inch of the original game is included here, with the addition of a 4-player game which requires each player to have a link-cable and an individual game cartridge. So if you and three friends all plan on buying this game, you can enjoy that little bonus. I haven't experienced yet, but then again, that's not why I bought this game. I bought it to play one of my favorite video games of all time again.Gamers who enjoyed this game over 10 years ago need no more motivation to buy this, but younger gamers are definitely in for a treat. While few games can be rightly be called timeless, this game definitely is. A 5-star masterpiece.\"", "Admittedly, lately-I've seen alot of SNES remakes for the Gameboy Advance. While that is good and all, it seems they aren't bringing back the ones that are worthy of seeing time on the handheld. Well, somebody must have got the right idea when this one was suggested. This classic is one of the best games of all-times. If you hadn't played it, you need to. It's a lengthy quest and definitely worth sinking your hard-earned money and time into. The graphics are colorful and crisp, and everything runs smoothly. An Awesome prelude to playing the new Wind Waker game for the Gamecube, that's for sure. I highly recommend it.", "To this day i still feel that A Link to the Past is the 2nd greatest Zelda adventure after Ocarina of Time. And considering how great that game is, thats saying a lot.A Link to the Past is every bit as enjoyable and polished as the day it came out over 10 years ago. I still remember picking it up the day it came out for the Super Nintendo. And now replaying it on a handheld brings back all the fond memories.The graphics are still great today and look very crisp and detailed. The play control is still perfect and the gameplay and fun is just about unsurpassed by any other game. Plucking the Master Sword from the lost woods or finally donning that Red Mail suit still makes me happy to this day.However, since i dont link up with other players i cant comment on the Four Swords multiplayer adventure. But looking at the graphics and items, it looks very similiar to Minish Cap and thats another amazing Zelda game... so Four Swords cant be all that bad. ;)So if youre looking for a near perfect adventure with the popular Link than look no further. This little game pak has it all.", "As far as SNES to GBA transitions go, this is awesome. They changed a few things, such as some of the dialogue from the SNES version, as well as adding Ocarina of Time's SFX to Link, but that doesn't bother me too much.This is my 2nd favorite Zelda game, right behind Ocarina of Time. For 16-bit rendition, it's epic and very time consuming. There's loads to do, and the story's very compelling. The game has a haunting atmosphere with some of its music and events, but it overall adds to the mysticism and epic quality of the long-sought &#34;Golden Power,&#34; and the price that has been paid by those who seek it.It's very loyal to the original edition, and for those who don't have an SNES but have a GBA, Nintendo DS or the Gamecube add-on that lets it play GBA games, it's a dream come true! Haven't played Four Swords, though I very much want to and I enjoyed Four Swords Adventures. Even without Four Swords though, I'd say this is worth buying.", "\"I can't count the hours I spent playing the Zelda games as a kid.  I was very pleased when Nintendo decided to start re-releasing the classics on the GBA.  This is very true to the original with a few changes.  Most additions they made I consider to be nice improvements, and they add a little \"\"new-ness\"\" to a very nastolgic game.  Other features, like Link screaming whenever he falls or swings his sword, are a bit annoying but quickly become unnoticable due to the sheer fun factor of the game.  The 4-swords addition is a nice touch as well, and adds a bit of multiplayer fun to the package.\"", "This game is a very good game. My experience with it was emotional, for I played this game on SNES and it broke on me. But, this game has no flaws, perfect gameplay, spectacular graphics, and better effects. It compares with Sword of Mana for it's XP points, Final Fantasy Tactics for its graphical design, and Golden Sun for it's art and creation. The game is good because it doesn't cross the line at difficulty and it helps the player with common sense. It puts the player in Link's shoes. There is no flaws, it is all fabulous.", "Borrowing a friend's copy for the Super NES system years earlier, I gave up on Link to the Past before I even found the wooden sword.  Having found the travel-sized version at a swap meet (tucked in with a copy of Professor Layton, basically getting 2 game for the price of one), it remains my first true exposure to Zelda.Before long, I was learning the ins and outs of every game that would follow; getting that wooden sword, cutting down foes and bushes, collecting rupees towards the purchase of healing potions and bombs, hoarding vital items and upgrades, exploring dangerous dungeons, and preparing for the final showdown with the Big Bad in order to rescue the princess.  And harassing harmless chickens.A central feature to LTTP is a magic mirror enabling Link to travel between the world of light and darkness--as a bunny.  Though the player eventually acquires an item that solves this problem, there are still traps that bypass the desired effects, and temporarily turn Link into a vulnerable bunny.  And unlike the Oracle games, one cannot come and go as he/she pleases; to travel from the Light World to the Dark World, the player must go back to the point from which he/she warped.  In terms of sound, the music and effects are outstanding, if you don't mind hearing the same 3 tracks through the majority of the game.To its credit, the other items available throughout LTTP makes the journey a lot easier, such as an ocarina that signals a bird to fly you to different areas in Light World, along with 3 hidden medallions that attack multiple enemies.  In the graphics department, LTTP looks exactly as it does in the Super NES version, and those Dorkly parody videos.  My one complaint is that the dungeon maps are so small compared to the SNES version.I can't really complain about the other game in the cartridge, though.  Actually, I can't say anything about Four Swords as it requires 2-4 people with their own GBA's and their own copies of Zelda to play it.  So by itself, LTTP racks up 4 stars in my book; as a bundle, you'd have to travel to the four corners of the globe to get the most out of it.This game is rated E for Everyone.", "\"One of the best games ever made for Nintendo's Super NES was undoubtedly the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and it's perfect port to the GBA was not only faithful to the original, but even improved on the classic game in some aspects as well.  Playing as stalwart hero Link, you are on a mission to once again save Princess Zelda from certain doom as you progress through Hyrule and traverse dungeons, solving puzzles and collecting items in your quest.  A Link to the Past featured many revolutionary elements back when first released for the Super NES, including the ability to travel back and forth between a \"\"light\"\" and \"\"dark\"\" world as you progress through the game, and it's dungeons still remain some of the best to ever appear in any RPG ever crafted.  The game's graphics are plenty colorful and look fantastic on the GBA's screen, and the ultra catchy music score and overall epic feel of the game is still second to none.  The additional feature, entitled the Four Swords, is a multiplayer (via link cable) blast that is an excellent little bonus in itself as well.  There are some minor tweaks in the game as well, including some digitized speech and sound effect elements and a few graphical and gameplay upgrades as well.  Do yourself a favor: if for some reason you missed out on the original Super NES classic and own a GBA, or even a DS, you have to add Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past to your library.  It's simply a perfect port of an all time classic that remains one of the best GBA games ever crafted, as well as one of the best games of it's type as well.\"", "I never played the origional lttp,(Link to the Past) but this game gives me a taste of early 90's gaming. The dungeons in this game can get extremely fustrating, and you might need a walkthrough many times, but it is a must-have nonetheless. The game also includes Four Swords, the first ever multiplayer game in the hit series. They are both great games, and I assure you that you will not be dissapointed when playing this game.", "This has to be one of the best deals available. Zelda Link to the Past and Pitfall Lost Expedition. I think Link to the Past is one of the best games available for the Game Boy Advance. Pitfall is a fun game in its own right. I cannot understand the less than perfect review it got from the critics. Did we play the same game? I happen to really like it. It's got great graphics and fun gameplay. I own many game consoles and top-notch games. In my opinion, and I have played countless video games throughout the years, Pitfall is a good game. You can't compare it with Zelda as it is an adventure game. Pitfall is your typical platformer. I have also played Pitfall for the Playstation and can say that this iteration is just as good. Pitfall gets my approval. You should get it while it comes free with Zelda. I did. You won't be disappointed."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.11622536182403564, 0.10503484308719635, 0.11046261340379715, 0.04031119495630264, 0.01029754988849163, 0.07452479004859924, 0.23953306674957275, 0.050875380635261536, 0.001493982970714569, 0.13319818675518036, 0.11804300546646118]]}
