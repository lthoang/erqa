I've set up many routers and never had issues.  I had a spare Linksys WRT54G wireless router and hooked it up to my cable modem for use in my house.  Unfortunately, I could not get the Linksys to connect to the Charter internet access account.  After researching online and going through MAC address cloning, plugging and unplugging, etc... it still didn't work.  I then went to Charter's website and saw that they provided the Netgear router to customers that rent the router from Charter.  So, I ordered it.I normally don't use the software setup on routers since I've configured many in different situations, but I figured that if this was the recommended router on the Charter website, that I'd use the software setup first.The setup was easy and clear to understand.Net result, within 7-10 minutes, I had Charter cable internet access working through the router.  Once I had the basic setup completed, I logged in manually to the router and configured other options that I wanted.  I added a Linksys Access Point for wireless and everything is working great.Pros:  Works with my cable modem (Charter) with no issues first time.Easy set up.Cons:  This con is for all home routers:  Not enough LAN connections.  I always end up adding a LAN switch, but I've got lots of connections at home.", "This is the fourth router of this type I've ordered and would order abother one of them again. The only problem I've run into is the powder supply will fail and take the router with it, Otherwise, I've had no problems with this router. I keep a spare on hand and will continue to do so. It's easy to set up and use and does a fairly decent job of blocking most malware. The two hardware firewalls work well and I've not had a serious infestation since I've been using it. Overall. It's fairly easy to set up but your should remember to turn pop up blockers when installing as they can block infor that you will need. A good buy for it's price.", "I purchases a Linksys router, because I happen to have 5 laptops and two PCs.  I got tired of switching cords.  Well, it works like a charm, thought it was a pain to install and set up.  EXCEPT, I could not download updates from Microsoft, I could not use Outlook Express with any hotmail accounts, I could not post messages in MSN groups.  Well I do these things dozens of times a day.  They help people responded with all sorts of stuff to do, but it NEVER WORKED.  I needed to access those things, so after a period I GAVE UP.I ordered Netgear and WOW.  In a matter of 5 minutes I had all all my computers on line at once, they accessed Microsoft update, they used Outlook no probs, and I was able to post in MSN.  So real installation to speak of, not settings ISPs, nothing.  Plugged it in and go...Boy, this is the way it SHOULD BE.  I recommend Netgear over Linksys anytime!", "\"I ordered mine after some exhaustive Internet research on all the other routers in the same price range on the market today.Two weeks later, mine allows me to share cable internet but not share files and printer between our two PCs.  In fact there is NOTHING in the otherwise excellent documentation and setup help manual & CD ROM that even touches upon this aspect of the router.  Therefore one is left with the unenviable task of trying to figure it out through Windows' [bad] Help files.Methinks the reviewer who said he had this router up and running 3 minutes out of the box must be either: 1. already a techno-geek well versed in the black arts of PC-land, or 2. working for Netgear!Lastly, the included \"\"Freedom\"\" Internet Security software is basically useless.  You're much better off with Norton's Internet Security or even ZoneAlarm.Sadly though, compared with other similarly priced routers, the RP614NA actually shines!\"", "I bought the NetGear RP614 to replace an Asante FriendlyNet 5 port 10 MBit hub and a Netgear RT311 10 MBit Gateway Router, both about 9 years old, for my home network running 3 Macs and an Airport. The RP614 has 4 ports which was perfect for my needs.Although the RP614 is rated at 10/100 MBit/s, my home cable network is unlikely to reach even the 10 MBit mark.  But I was tired of all the collisions that I was getting on large file transfers and thought that replacing the old hub with a switch might help.  And it did.  Totally.There was no set-up to speak of (God Bless Macintosh). I just removed the old hub and router and plugged the RP614 in and connected all the computers and the airport and restarted the modem and then turned on the RP614 and everything was happy.  I checked the disk that came with the router but there was nothing on it that was needed for a home network that was already configured.I noticed a small speed boost right away when connecting to commonly used commercial web sites (I am pretty sure this is true even though I didn't bother to measure it or even test the ping times - and I don't know why this happens since my cable does not come close to 10 MBits/sec) but the biggest difference was in large file transfers when several computers and the Airport are active.  No more collisions.  I think just getting rid of the hub and replacing it with a switch was probably the big thing, but now I only need one power supply instead of two and the RP614 is about the same size as my old hub was, so I am totally satisfied.  All this, and less than $40.  A good deal in my book.", "\"This router seems to work pretty well. Throughput is good and setup via the web interface is simple and has many options if you want to use them.  I did have a major problem with this unit; after several weeks of operation, it would randomly quit working and would require cycling the power a few times a day to restore operation.  I was ready to toss it in the trash and replace it with something else when, as a last resort, I pushed the \"\"default reset\"\" button on the rear panel, next to the power connector.  This dumps all the configuration settings, requiring them to be re-entered; but in my case, doing so restored normal operation -  I haven't had to cycle the power in weeks.\""], "Gamma": [0.4999552071094513, 0.5000448226928711], "Beta": [[0.002428127685561776, 0.8638790845870972, 0.01105552725493908, 0.0449087880551815, 0.05875227227807045, 0.01897622086107731], [0.00242809671908617, 0.8638788461685181, 0.011055274866521358, 0.044908955693244934, 0.058752503246068954, 0.01897633820772171]]}
