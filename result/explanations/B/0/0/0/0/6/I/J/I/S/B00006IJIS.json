I am convinced that Shenmue was the ONLY reason to own a Dreamcast and I anxiously awaited Shenmue II.  But then Sega announced it would discontinue the DC and that eventually even Shenmue II was cancelled for US release (though Europe and Japan did get it).  Luckily for us, Microsoft kindly picked this title up for it's XBOX and gave us US gamers hope that the series would continue on!It was a long wait, but finally the definitive version of Shenmue II has arrived!  XBOX owners truly benefit and to reward us for our wait and loyalty, Microsoft included a full length DVD movie of the first Shenmue game (awesome!!) and they went back and improved the game by improving the textures, adding voice dubbing (I hate subtitles) featuring the same voice actor who did Ryo's voice in Shenmue 1, and added hard drive support, faster load times, a rock-solid frame rate, and so much more!  And it's all on ONE DVD disc!  No need to swap discs during play like we were used to on the Dreamcast versions (the DC version of Shenmue consisted of FOUR discs!).  Needless to say, Microsoft and Sega did a fantastic job making this the definitive version for the true Shenmue fan!  They could have done a quick and dirty port and just called it a game, but they wisely chose to improve it!The game is great...a strangely addictive mixture of Virtua Fighter-style fighting, 3D exploration/detective work, and some QTE events. The world you interact with is a true living/breathing world complete with clock and common people who follow schedules and daily patterns!  It's so much fun just to walk around interacting with everyone and seeing how people react.  This is as close to a virtual world as you'll find!  The fight scenes are great and there are also full versions of classic Sega games like Hang on/AfterburnerII/Space Harrier!!Whether you're a true fan or just looking for a great adventure with plenty to do, buy Shenmue II today.  You will not regret your purchase!", "A year ago, I waited and waited for Shenmue II to come to the Dreamcast, but after I heard that it was cancelled because Yu Suzuki decided to port it over to the XBox, I was all but angry at Suzuki-san ! If it hadn't been for the cancellation for the North American DC Shenmue II, then perhaps the Dreamcast would be a more memorable machine before it died out in 2002. Now in November, Shenmue II is about to hit the shelves for the XBox only. And you can bet, it will be one of the greatest Sega titles to hit the XBox...of course, Sega will be making mostly XBox titles than just PS2, GC and GBA games ! From what I've heard from all of you, the game still retains its realism from the prequel and the QTE still exists ! And as always, Shenmue II's visuals will be served as eye-candy to the gamers who have stuck with the prequel and the European version of Shenmue II. This is yet another preview that I'm giving out ! When it comes out, expect an immediate review from yours truly ! Can't wait 'till it comes out !", "I was a fan of the original, but just barely bought the sequel because I had Metroid Prime... Metroid will always win out in priorities, but Sega fans and Xboxers should buy this game without hesitation.Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the sleeper Dreamcast hit that debuted at the end of the Dreamcast's life, in fact it was the last Dreamcast game I bought, and it is to this day my favorite DC title simply because this game is a very versatile title. There is no genre that this game series does not cover at some point. Ryo has to learn new skills, and master them, like RPGs, he has to gather clues and information collect items, etc, like RPGs, there's a deep and compelling story, like RPGs, there's mini games galore, exploration, adventure, fighter game type action (similar to the Virtual Fighter Engine.) There's so much going on in this game, its part sim, part RPG, part adventure, part fighter... How could someone not enjoy it? Especially since many of the flaws of the original game have been fixed? Lost? You can easily find someone to show you around. Broke? Part time jobs, though I don't recommend gambling... I lost over $1,000 that way, ironically right after I had won that much! All this in the midst of what is at its core one of the most comprehensive and beautiful epic stories of our day. I've been enthralled by the story of the game, but sadly sales of this remarkable game have been less that stellar. The game is selling so poorly that there may not be a Shenmue 3, and the story is far from over. It isn't fair that such an artistic and beautiful game like this be passed over without so much as a second glance. I implore all Xboxers out there, please save Shenmue and at least give this game a look. There's a movie included with the game that summarizes the plot of the first game, although the movie does not do justice to the original game itself, which has a great deal more to it, it will still let you know what you need to know to get by story wise in Shenmue 2, and in all honesty Shenmue 2 has far fewer flaws. Many people found some aspects of the original tedious, like having to wait around for hours on end for an event, but thankfully this one allows you to fast forward to the appropriate time, rather than seeking out stuff to do. Because Sega and AM2 addressed so many of the flaws of the first game it is well worth it to pick this title up, even if you haven't played through the original. Just watch the movie first and you'll be fine. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME! Don't let this masterpiece fade into oblivion... imagine if 24 were cancelled midseason and you'd know how I feel about there not being a Shenmue 3.", "\"I can't really explain why I fell so deeply in love with Yu Suzuki's first console release, the Dreamcast's original Shenmue. Perhaps it was the sense of complete freedom, which allowed players to spend their income however they saw fit, completely disregarding the story in favor of video games and little toy capsules. Maybe it had more to do with the utterly enveloping environment, which went further toward becoming a totally immersive scenario than any other game in history. Who knows, maybe it was the game's setting in mid-80s Japan, two cultures I've always found fascinating (80s pop culture and traditional Japanese culture). One thing's for certain, it wasn't the emotionless, deer-in-the-headlights expression constantly sported by the story's hero, Ryo Hazuki. Regardless, I was hooked on this story of revenge, reality, and the kind of awkward relationships characteristic of our teenage years.Though the Dreamcast sequel never arrived in America, Sega revamped the title, added a few new features and finally released it on Microsoft's Xbox. Alongside Halo, it was my first purchase for the enormous black and green machine.Bar none, the coolest thing about the Shenmue series is its outrageous attention to detail. There exist hundreds of storefronts, people, objects, games and environments that don't have any impact whatsoever on the story itself. They could've just as easily been left out, yet their inclusion broadens the game's scope substantially. Almost every doorway can be opened, every object, from the fliers hanging in a popular street corner to the televisions hidden away in the corner of a pawn shop, can be examined in detail. Sega even carried on the tradition of including emulated versions of Suzuki's arcade hits, this time packing in Afterburner II, Out Run, Hang On and Space Harrier.There's no such thing as a cut scene in Shenmue II, everything you see is live rendered. And, while that was a real feat for the Dreamcast (producing graphics on the fly that rivaled those of the Psone and N64's pre-renders), it's not as impressive on the Xbox. Though it gives it the old college try, Shenmue isn't as visually impressive as Rygar: The Legendary Adventure on the PS2, Metroid Prime on the Gamecube or even Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee on the Box itself. Honestly, though the visuals are improved slightly, this still looks, feels and functions much like a Dreamcast game. The water effects, especially, pale in comparison to what we've already seen the Xbox can do. The game looks above average at best. Not great, but still good. As I mentioned earlier, the real strength of Ryo's world is the tremendous variety in the storefronts, environments and various items, and this is something that helps set it apart from the pack.Occasionally, Ryo will be drawn into a fight scene, which functions like a strange blend of Final Fight and Tekken. Visually, the transition between \"\"wander and talk mode\"\" and \"\"fight bunch of guys mode\"\" is almost seamless. Very rarely are these fights one-on-one affairs, and you're usually called upon to take down upwards of a half dozen guys at one time. You've got an impressive list of moves at your disposal, with more available as the game progresses, but really only utilize about ten or eleven on a regular basis.The musical score to Shenmue II follows in the footsteps of the original; it's epic. Every one of the arrangements in the game serves to broaden the scope of this already impressive, expansive title. It truly feels like you're playing a character in a major motion picture, and it invokes your emotions at just the right moments. Near the game's conclusion, when Ryo stands atop the roof of the tallest building in town, staring into the sunset, you really feel as though you're coming of age along with him. When he first rides into port aboard an enormous ocean liner in the game's opening scene, the music further emphasizes that this is the beginning of a tremendous journey. It really is that solid.Pity I can't say the same about the voice acting. Every one of the characters is just as wooden and emotionless as Ryo himself, which is one of the dark clouds that seems to have followed this series throughout its existence. Though everyone in town has a distinct voice, they all share similar traits; nobody gets excited about ANYTHING, and they all place intonations on the wrong words with frightening regularity. Ryo himself is one of the least appealing characters I've ever played, and nearly everyone in the world seems to share this disposition. It's hard to get excited about the revelations involving Lan Di and his relationship to Ryo's father, when those making the revelations are themselves completely disinterested in the proceedings.Included with the Xbox version is a DVD containing the majority of the cutscenes from the original Shenmue for Dreamcast. I found this to be a great, somewhat quick, refresher course before diving into the new events. It'd been years since I last ventured into this world, and I was reminded of several small threads I'd have otherwise forgotten. On that same hand, I can imagine how much the inclusion of this disc would have aided players with absolutely no experience with the Dreamcast. A great idea, and something I wish more gaming dynasties would consider.Overall, I found myself enjoying the first Shenmue more than I did the sequel. This is still a series I'd be interested in seeing pursued, but no matter what you may have heard... it HAS taken a small step down with this release. While the first game focused much more on Ryo's inability to relate to his peers, his awkward social life and his pure intention to avenge his father's murder, the sequel delves more into the spiritual and political ramifications of his actions. It wasn't quite as much fun as the original, though the overall feel was very similar.\"", "This was a great RPG game.  This is the only kind of RPG I can play. I really don't like most other RPG's requiring you to learn a new language, fight every other scene, etc. etc.  Its like playing Starwars, without any weapons.  (I hated all the Starwars movies!)I do, though, enjoy this type of game though!  I love the games that give us a beautiful, well known city as the backdrop (Max Payne, Fear Effect 1 and 2, Spiderman, Shenmue 1 and 2, etc.)with a great mix of gameplay, and exploration.  This is my favorite type of RPG style game.I give this game two gamer thumbs up!!!  Awesome!!!MC White said:  Check it out!!!", "While Shenmue 2 never sold well on the Xbox,it sold quite a lot on the DC. This was due to people being outraged that a completed DC game got canceled at literally the last minute and moved over onto the Xbox for a North American release (Shenmue 2 was supposed the DC very last game,think of it as going out with a bang) So a majority of people ignored the Xbox version completely and imported the English subbed PAL version. Anyway enough with the history lesson on with the review.Shenmue 2 takes place right after the events of Shenmue 1. Shenmue 1 only contained 1 chapter of the Shenmue universe whereas Shenmue 2 contains 3 chapters. One thing that people will notice right away is that there was a whole chapter dedicated to the ship but it is only mentioned in the game near the beginning in one sentence (you can unlock a few books that tell you what happened on the ship) A nice touch that was done for Xbox owners who purchased the game was that Sega decided to included a 1hr 30min DVD on the events of Shenmue (it's just a DVD with every cut scene in the game). I can tell you right now if you didn't like Metal Gear Solid because of all the story telling. Then Shenmue 2 is not for you,it is basically just an interactive movie. I found that there was not as much fighting as the back of the box makes out to be.The graphics of Shenmue 2,while beefed up a bit for the Xbox,Shows it was essentially a straight port from the Dreamcast with a few extra features added in,there is now a camera option in the game witch lets you take pictures of people in the game to unlock a whole lot of stuff.Overall Shenmue 2 is a great game if its your kind of thing. Its just very sad that we are most likely going to be stuck with the cliffhanger ending that ended Shenmue 2.", "\"One of the Greatest Dreamcast games ever made is finally making it's second appearance...ON THE MICROSOFT XBOX.  Shenmue II not only out does the first one in every way but surprasses it even more, this game is unbelievable.  It is handsdown, my favorite Xbox game ever...EVER.  The story continues with Ryu Hazuki on the journey to find his fathers murderer and to meet a man who may know alot of things about his father then he'd imagine.  Now the game takes place in Hong Kong, and Ryu is still on the hunt....get ready because not only are playing one of the best sequals to a game ever..but you'll be having one of the greatest video game experiences....ever..Shenmues Graphics are just amazing, As you've already notice I'm not going to give it a negative on visuals since it's not fair because this is a DIRECT PORT from Dreamcast....Those idiots like IGN and gamemagazines should of known this is a direct port and that the visuals were going to be bumped up, hell it would take poor suzukie EVEN MORE YEARS to make the visuals amazing....but who cares cause this game is still AMAZING.  The sound/music is just as beautiful as the original Shenmue, sometimes I'd just stand at one area and listen to the music..it's just so brilliant..  The level desighn for Hong Kong/Kowloo is just incredible, especially one the final chapter of the game, which I won't spoil.  Something I like Shenmue II more then Shenmue I is that Shenmue II is just one of those flat out \"\"Sequals that didn't fail one bit\"\" as I can see alot of people love this game but are dissapointed compared to the original...I'm not one bit, Something that Shenmue I had that made me fall in love with the game was the FREE BATTLES and QTE'S....Theres even WAY MORE of those in Shenmue II, and they've never looked so good on the Xbox.  Other then the sequal having more action then it's predecessor, something that I loved about Shenmue is that it got you all pumped up all the way to the grand finale...THIS DOESN'T FAIL AT ALL.  Especially the Yellow Head Building part, which is by far one of the greatest moments in Video game history..  Everything about Shenmue II on Xbox is amazing....It's just so Brilliant!!!!!Now for anyone who hated Shenmues Slow paced gameplay DO NOT GET THIS GAME, Shenmue II is just the same(but a lil better) as it's predecessor.  It will take awhile to get to the action....More like when you're at the end of the first chapter which by the far longest in this game..  Did I mention this has a very good Length..If you skip all the sidequests and just beat the story for the first thenmue, it would take about maybe...10 to 14 hours...It took me about 13 hours and 45 minutes.. Shenmue II takes about 20 to 30 hours of just playing the story mode of it and skipping some side quests....It's just bigger, better and longer...The Good-Superb Visuals and got a bit bumped up on the Xbox-longer then the original-the voice acting got a tad bit better but not by much-Theres more character development and we finally know what SHENMUE means!!-An amazing scenarion that has to do with the Yellow Head Building and LAN DI!!-More FREE BATTLES and QTE'S-More clues to find and people to ask, for me it was fun-The Music is beautiful-IT'S Just better then the original...that's all I can say about that....The Bad-The controls are TERRIBLE, I had to adjust em' before playing the game-It got a lot of bad review on lots of sites about it's visuals...they should have known it's a straight port from the Dreamcast-Just like the Dreamcast...Poor Sales for Shenmue II means NO Shenmue III in the future-Some like myself were left wanting more after Shenmue II's Ending...amazing though..Shenmue II on the Xbox is one of the best games ever made, and one of the most overlooked xbox title ever..period..  Just like every other Sega Game on Xbox...  Please if you liked the original you will LOVE Shenmue II, it's just better, longer, better looking, more action, MORE EVERYTHING!!  Why the perfect score?..Because on like most of the idiots who gave it abad score cause of Visuals, I'm being mature about it, so what if it's a direct port from DC, The visuals are still amazing even if it's no Doom 3 or Ninja Gaiden....Other then that, Shenmue II is just a beautiful game and that is why I give it a.......5 out of 5 stars...Brilliant game....\"", "I'm starting this review with a plea to Sega, you have to release Shenmue 3, how can they leave the series dead after the ending of this game.  The Shenmue series are among my favourite games of all time, I finished Shenmue II and immediately wanted to play the next episode in the saga.  Sadly it seems at the moment this isn't going to happen, which is a crying shame, but I can only hope Sega change their mind.As for my review of Shenmue II, it like it's predecessor is a classic, in fact I think they even outdid the original with this.  It is a much bigger game, taking place over 3 large areas, including Kowloon in Hong Kong.  The scope of the game is massive, there is so much to see and do, and in Kowloon there are 40ft scyscrapers to explore amongst other things.  The only drawback from the original is that the online features are gone, in other words you can no longer set high scores for the mini games and put them on the world ranknings.  This is only a minor compaint however, the fighting is as slick as the previous Shenmue game, with numerous moves (taken from the virtua fighter engine) to master.  There are now more arcade games, with classics like Outrun added, and more slot machines and even more toys to collect.  If you wanted to you could waste days on this game, there is just so much to see and do.As with Shenmue I, it's a classic, I only hope Sega get it together and Ryu Hazuki's adventure ends properly.", "\"Long wait. Then here it came, SHENMUE 2!! I remember getting this game for christmas, then I played it for a week straight all day everyday. It left off EXACTLY where Shenmue 1 ended, so it took you right into the next chapter of the story!! This Shenmue has way moer of a free world than Shenmue 1 did, which is a little better. This game is awesome graphics, ALOT more people and alot more things you can do! It just blows my mind that this game didn't sell more copies than it did! This game has an awesome storyline to it, and it also has alot more fighting in it which is a good thing, since Shenmue 1 didn't have THAT much fighting. If you have an Xbox, I HIGHLY recommend this game, and if you have a Dreamcast, I highly recommend the \"\"Shenmue\"\" on that system. This game is great, its also a longer game than the first Shenmue which is a plus!!!I hope SHENMUE 3 hits stores!!!!!!\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07235970348119736, 0.017825083807110786, 0.009320169687271118, 0.1119515597820282, 0.020560624077916145, 0.23164010047912598, 0.025152355432510376, 0.30598902702331543, 0.20520137250423431]]}
