Funny because story wise it marks the earliest game.This game was marred by the partner system, which is not implemented very well. It's a shame because the game is oozing with atmosphere and introduces some very cool new monsters. This game introduces more new enemies than any of the other sequels to the original.The control is the same as any traditional RE game except they have removed the spin from this one. That joystick now controls the partner character. As much as I have tried to hate this game I cannot for the very reason that it does have great atmosphere, revisits some old locations from a past Resident Evil (you'll know which one if you play far enough) and marks the end of the \"\"real\"\" Resident Evil series.Get this one but only after you've played the better ones such as 1,2,3 and Code Veronica.\"", "\"I've been a on again off again fan of RE for some time now. I like the concept of the games, but I just don't like the games. RE 2 and every game after it was just too boring. Code Veronica for Dreamcast was the best of the lot in my opinion, so that upped my memories of the games a little bit. Sadly, upon playing RE for the Gamecube, all the truth about this series came flooding back. I rented it for five days, played it for two.First off, this game just isn't scary anymore. RE2 could creep me out like nothing since the original Alone in the Dark. This game however, just feels so \"\"been there, done that.\"\". The first zombie I met I tried to shoot and kill, big mistake. Surprise, it killed me despite being pumped with several rounds from my handgun. So, annoyed, I restarted. This time I ran&#65533; and that worked. After reading up in some walkthroughs, I found out that you spend the vast majority of your time doing just that, running. \"\"Survival Horror\"\". I was depressed. None the less, I figured I'd give it a try. For two days I ran from everything in sight. I tried not to chuckle at the \"\"horror\"\" of it all, and kept running. Even when I finally got the firepower to fight back a little, the game had lost appeal. And of course I use the word \"\"firepower\"\" very lightly, ammo is rarer than gold in just about any RE game out there, and of course you'll never get a useful unlimited hand to hand fighting tool except for your worthless survival knife. Why can't your character effectively shoot them in the head? Just give me some dang weapons and the ability to use them!I really can't see why anyone would enjoy a game of this type. I can't see the appeal to anyone but the most casual gamer or hardcore horror fan. My advice, avoid this one completely. If you're a big RE fan, rent it. But don't buy it without trying it first or you may regret it.- Rirath_com\"", "\"When I met the Resident Evil Series, it was Code Veronica for the DC.  It was amazing.  I was hooked even before I had left the first area of the facility.  It was a mood and a style of play that needs to be experienced.Now comes RE Zero.  For the first time you can actually have 2 usable, working charactors on the same screen, something no doubt that many players of the other games wondered about.  This fact alone greatly increases the fun off the game...and the annoyance level.  Nothing is worse than getting a player trapped in a room because he or she is being eaten on.  It is difficult of not impossible to bypass tough enemies with both players at once.  And oft times, the shotgun armed charactor will shoot a leech on the ground, wasting a precious shot unless watched.These gripes aside, you will find that the possibilities of play with two charactors are endless or nearly so.  Boss battles take on a whole new ideal thanks to the ability to quickly change perspectives.  Puzzles are now even a little fresher due to the need to use both charactors.But this is still RE, the game many love to hate.  A friend of mine was watching me play and asked politely,\"\" how do you know theres a zombie on the screen?  How do you know you are hitting him?\"\"  This is a common problem of the game.  To fully build the ideal of a scary movie, most areas are broken into set scenes.  This means that unless your in the same scene as the enemy, you'll be unable to see him.  A normal experience for the vetran but a terrifying one for newbies.Finally, there has been a lot of general marryment over the completion of the story.  This is Zero, the first RE.  But I felt things were just a little dis-jointed in comparison to the origional.  By my thinking, Rebecca should have been leading Chris around the mansion after experienceing all she did.  Just a few small things.So buy it if you like RE, think carefully if you passingly like the idea, stay away if you prefer killing in first or 3rd person.\"", "But the formula is getting old at this point.Granted the developers tried to shake things up with the character switching.Honestly I didn't care for that aspect of the game, it just made the whole thing very tedious.The graphics were great.The music is there.The atmosphere is there.But this is the first RE game I literally had to force myself to finish.It just wasn't that much fun for me.If you're new to RE than yes this is a great game.But for me?After playing RE, RE2, RE Code Veronica.Zero just felt stale.Run around, push crates, shoot zombies, solve puzzles, fight big scary guy at the end.There was nothing new brought here.I'm still giving it four stars because it's still a good RE game, it's just too much of a rehash.Thankfully RE4 came along and gave us some much needed change.That said.It's a great game by itself just don't expect anything groundbreaking if you're a veteran of the series.Recommended.", "\"I see a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews on this game. I dont know maybe there playing another game because from what I see from this game is not at all impressive. While the concept and graphics of the game is good, the control of this game is where it falls way WAY short. Controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome, simply walking/running in narrow areas can get frustrating, I won't even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction. I don't know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is, but it works!! On top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions, when your trying to pick something up, you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds, you press the shoot button, and your characters just stand there while getting attacked, when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen, you can still be attacked even though you can't see where it is so you can shoot it. Top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take 7 shots to kill with the pistol. I'm sure the controls take some getting used to, but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls. The game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens. Cut screens when you pick up something, cut screens when you walk up or down stairs, cut screens when you climb a ladder, cut screens when you open a door, cut screen when you switch character controls. And if the game wasn't already SLOW enough, text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster. \"\"A..R..E.T..H..E.......F..A..I..N..T......S..O..U..N..D..S......O..F.........F..O..O..T..S..T..E..P..S.....T..H..O..S..E.....O..F.....S..U..R..V..I..V..O..R..S.?\"\" is NOT something I want to sit through EVERY SINGLE time I load a game.I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game....If this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly, had controls like Xbox's Splinter cell, then maybe this would be a very good game. But as it stands, my second GameCube game is a waste of my time and money. I guess I was spoiled by my Xbox's splinter cell and even my game cube's Metroid Prime. And to think I thought splinter cell was cumbersome when I first played it. HA! Don't waste your money unless you absolutely LOVE the resident evil series.\"", "What's strange about a series like Resident Evil is that with 5 main canon games (1, 2, 3, Code Veronica and Zero) before 4 overhauled the series for the better, many were complaining about the lack of gameplay innovation and Capcom's tendency to stick to the same thing many grew to despise over the years and yet we almost forgive the same thing with series like Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, Halo or Legend of Zelda. So Zero in a sense is the last time the old gameplay will be featured and while there's a couple of new innovations and refinements, it's still the same and like the saying goes: it might not be the best but it's certainly better than anyone else doing the same thing.Story: Taking place before the mansion incident of Resident Evil, Rebecca Chambers of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team is en route in helicopter investigating strange murders when they experience engine trouble and make an emergency landing. While exploring, Rebecca finds an empty train and encounters Billy Coen, an ex-marine who was scheduled to be executed when he escaped. The 2 have to team up in order to survive and in the process, learn about the founders of Umbrella and many other secrets.Graphics: The REmake boisted some of the most atmospheric and all-around immaculately detailed graphics the Gamecube has ever seen. While it doesn't have that great art design the mansion and its surroundings brought, Zero is a step-up with even more realistic shadows and lights, especially during the train where lights whiz past the windows and throw quick shadows on the floor. The creatures are just as messed up and awesome as well but the color palette is kind of, I don't know, bland.Sound/Music: What was odd about the REmake was that there was a lot of really eerie, atmospheric music yet most of the time it mainly used the sound effects to set the tone and Zero makes better use of the sound spectrum with so many sounds and creepy music to provide its weirdness. The voice acting, while still B-movie in nature, is a bit more improved and not as annoying.Gameplay: Same control scheme so veterans will not have issues but newbies will definately feel the learning curve. Basically, wherever your character is, pressing Up will always be forward and Down will make them back up. In a 3D environment, it does feel awkward but if you've played previous games, you'll know what to expect so it's not as big an issue. But the big gameplay change is the zapping system where you control Rebecca and Billy at the same time where you can either have them follow you or make them stay in place (a la Ashley in Resident Evil 4). Some puzzles require teamwork. One early example is Billy is locked in a room with a jammed door, a dumbwaiter and a key. He puts the key in dumbwaiter, switch to Rebecca who grabs it, unlocks a door to get an Ice pick, send it back to Billy who uses it to unlock the door. Some of it is clever while others aren't used to their full potential. Also, the partner can be set to Action where they'll attack the enemy who's trying to grab you or Idle where they just sit there, helping conserve ammo. It's not as cumbersome as you'd expect and it's even welcome in some areas.The other gameplay change is in regards to the item boxes. While I personally never had an issue with them, many had an issue with having to walk back everywhere to deposit an item you don't need yet or ever or get an item that's required for story advancement. Now in Zero is the ability to drop items whenever you want with a handy map that tells you not only what's there but the specific location on the map. While it's incredibly useful to get rid of ammo for a gun you don't even have, there's times where you leave them in close proximity to another and have to somehow accurately put your character over it to pick it up, plus there's just way too many items, from herbs to ammo to bigger weapons retaining their taking up 2 spaces aside from REmake's one slot (a major letdown), they'll just be a lot of stuff to sift through.As far as the difficulty is concerned, it's a little bit more annoying than the REmake was since while gone are the Crimson Heads, in its place are leech zombies who have a loooong reach with their tentacles, can withstand several grenade blasts and even explode before they die, making it hurt even more. Advice is to avoid at all costs, then of course there's big toads and agile monkeys and with narrow hallways and cluttered rooms, you'll end up running into a lot of monsters. While the series has always recommended you save ammo and run, it should be greatly emphasized here.Resident Evil Zero is certainly a welcome addition to the series with its creepy atmosphere, gameplay mechanics and its story but one can see why 4 became the overhaul that changed the series for the better.", "Resident Evil 0 serves as a prequel to every single Resident Evil game that has been made thus far. With that being said, this game had a lot of pressure to deliver a really good story. For the most part, its' story is unchanged: The protagonist becomes stuck in an isolated location and must fend off zombies in order to survive. However, this game took away the whole box system that Resident 1,2 and 3 used. Instead, it let your characters (that's right: you control two characters at the same time in this game) drop off items to make space and then come back and get them at a later time. The controls are pretty much the same from all the other RE games before RE 4. A big weak-point is the variety of bosses. While they are not necessarily easy, they do not take much effort to kill, and they are nothing more than just over-sized insects and other amphibians. All in all, I don't regret buying this game, but it is definitely not the best one in the series by any means.", "\"Need more proof that Nintendo GameCube is indeed a powerful console? If you still think that XBox is the end all tell of video games, shame on you. Once more Capcom has put out a game of amazing beauty for the GameCube, once more they have given us a game containing better graphics than anything on XBox, and once more they manage to scare us half to death, and make us have a blast at the same time.This game is not without faults, however. I play this game on a 27\"\" GE TV. I guess because of the large screen (there are larger) I can see a lot more of the flaws that SOME, but not all of the game's cut scenes contain. Over all this game looks better than the RE-make released earlier this year, but there are some scenes that contain a jarring amount of aliasing (jaggies), which I firmly believe, could have been smoothed out better. On the other side of the coin there is not one hick up in the flow of the cinemas, where as the RE Make had occasional skipping in some parts of the game. I believe that neither flaw needs to exist, but neither the occasional jaggies, nor vinyl looking FMV sequences detract much from the enjoyability of RE 0 which is still a fantastic game.The control is still an issue. While I agree that the control style is clunky, I am so used to it these days that it doesn't matter to me. I'll take this control style over the mouse & keyboard dual analogue control style that has been rearing its ugly head a lot of late. I also enjoyed the character swapping; it was smooth, with no additional loading like I feared it would need. It ads a lot to the game play.I think that the ability to drop items anywhere is a double edge sword. On one hand its nice to be able to do that for an emergency when you need a really big gun and can't grab it because you have two herbs that are wasting space, or a brief case, or whatever... but I miss the item boxes where I could dump everything and be able to magically get it from another box further in the game. Having both would have been nice.Over all RE 0 is a worthy addition to the Resident Evil Saga, and a welcome one at that. I still wish that they would completely remake RE 2, 3 and Code Veronica while they're at it. So far these GameCube Resident Evils have been phenomenal... I am eager to get my hands on part 4.\"", "Resident Evil 0 is one of my favorite Resident Evil games. In this game, you will play both characters Rebecca and Billy. The controls are similar to the GameCube games. The graphics are awesome, scary, and brutal. This game had scary monsters, hard puzzles, and partner switching. I played this game before, it was scary, a bit hard and I managed to beat it. This game takes place before the Mansion Incident aka Resident Evil. S.T.A.R.S. Bravo member, Rebecca Chambers is dispatched to a train incident where leeches and zombies are inside and find convict killer and former Marine member Billy Coen who is sentenced to death. In this game, our heroes will discover revenge, corruption, hate, and murder caused by one certain person. This game is now rereleased to the WII system and I gave this game 5 stars.", "Resident Evil 0 is the prequal to the original RE. Taking place before the mansion. You play as Bravo Team's Rebecca Chambers [a hottie] and Billy [ a man accused of murder]. When Bravo Team's copter crashes, the team finds a wrecked transport and learns about Billy. Meanwhile, Rebecca investigates a train, and so the nightmare begins...Gameplay: It's the standard Re gameplay: solve puzzles, survive, kill zombies. But this time there are a few twists. For example, it now has a character switcher. Rebecca and Billy will work together. You can split them up, make them work together, and more. You might need to split up to solve puzzles. Another twist is that this time there are no item boxes, but this time you can drop items and the map will keep track of the items. Lastly, we now have this tough new zombie called a Leech Zoimbie. These things are hard to kill, and are annoying as hell. Even if you blow off their head, they will still be alive.Graphics: Very realistic. Very detailed, and the cutscenes look awesome.Sound/Voices: Voices are pretty decent this time. The sound is great.Overall, a great entry that is somehow underrated. Great for RE fans.", "This Zero is sucha a great game!!! I love it so much because the graphics are amazing.. I have not seen such a relistic graphic b4... The gameplay is superb!!! Being able to control both characters and play as either solo or team adds up to the resident evil magnificent survival horror game franchise. I recently bought Nintendo Gamecude because of MGS: The Twin Snakes. I was also a Resident Evil PS2 fan... Having finished Resident 2, 3 and Code Veronica, why not give Zero a try and I was rightand indeed happy and satisfied. My money well worth spent on such a fantastic game. I am therefore looking forward for Resident Evil 4 this fall......2004", "The prequel to the first, RE ZERO is a fantastic video game. The graphics, the sounds, the gameplay... it's bursting at the seams with its own evil goodness.It's completely original, too! The leeches, the leech-zombies.. ugh. I HATE the music when you see a Marcus zombie, but it's a great composition, if not abnormally CREEPY.ZERO has unique features not fond in your usual Resident Evil game. The partner switching is.., well, what can I say? WOW! Capcom just displayed another genius idea!", "Resident Evil Zero did not live up to its hype. Graphic wise I think its great but gameplay can get boring at times. Some parts meay leave you stuck looking for puzzle answers instead of having some action. If you haven't played any Resident Evil game or Eternal Darkness then I suggest that you play ED first before playing RE0 just so you could appreciate a good game. - Another note, when you don't make use of bullets effieciently the game is pretty much over, while on the other hand in ED you can always use magic, swords, maces ect.", "This game is sweet!  It enriches the already awesome RE storyline by showing you what happened before the mansion!  The gameplay is classic resident evil style (i.e., tank like controls), and the sound and graphics are top notch!  This game really shows you what the GameCube is capable of.  The challenge is much lower than the remake of RE for GameCube (for that I am thankful!), and the play through is rather quick.  I think it'd be easy for most people to play through in less than 10 hours.  Don't let that short time scare you off though!  There is plenty of replay value.  If you finish the game once on any challenge mode (no matter how bad you do), you get a bonus game and access to extra wardrobe in the regular game.  THe better you do, the more extras are unlocked.  This really is an outstanding game.  [The only bad thing about this game are the leach zombies (they're kinda like normal zombies, but rubber-like and nasty).]", "The first GameCube All Original Resident Evil. The game picks up the backstory, before the mansion, the Island, Raccoon City...before it all. Now we know why Rebecca Chambers was in the mansion in the first place. We know her story.Controls:Typical Resident Evil. For new RE players, a learning curve is involved, but fans will be well used to the layout.Visuals:Breathtaking cut-scenes and character movements. It stays in league with the RE remake and also expands in certain ways. Japanese model & singer Ayumi Hamasaki modeled for the character of Rebecca, so anyone familiar with her will know the charater is gorgeous.Gameplay:Typical RE gameplay, search, explore, unlock puzzles. I'm not going to go into great length on this review simply because most of us know what to expect by now.Gameplay II:The buddy system is like a double-edged sword. It's clever to add the new aspect to the game which helps in tough spots. You can have a character explore one part of the passenger train and the Umbrella Research & Training facility while the other explores another area. Team the two up (Rebecca Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen) and you've got double firepower to take down the various creatures (both new ones & old ones, some of the newer are very interesting.) Certain situations will leave one character needing the help of the other, i.e. trapped in a room and the only way to get out is to have the other character solve the problem.Sound:One of the creepiest sound settings in RE history. Turn out the lights, put the headphones on, and play away. Every movement, natural sound, and haunting music was placed into the game.Overall:A great new prequel to the Resident Evil series. With RE 2, Nemesis, and Code: Veronica due out in 2003 for GameCube, the series will live on. Don't forget, the all new continuation Resident Evil 4 is due in 2003 as well.Robert Eldridge (...)", "This game is one of the little good games of zombies from the Resident Evil series. I recommned you at lot, the graphics and sounds are excellent. You sure will feel fear", "This game is awesome, I got a gamecube just so i could play it. It's great that you can leave items wherever you want and exchange them between characters. The switching characters part is also great. Sometimes these two features can be annoying, but most of the time, it's fun. It's also easier to kill a lot of the bosses in this game, which makes sense once you think about the storyline of all Resident Evil games. You also get to play a bonus &quot;leech hunter&quot; game once you win. The graphics and sound are flawless. This game is a must have!", "After several years of encountering zombies, there's no doubt, the Resident Evil series has definitely aged. When Capcom signed an exclusive deal with Nintendo to bring the series to the GameCube, it still brought little hope to the already tired RE formula. After the impressive Resident Evil remake, Resident Evil Zero was finally released. Gamers had to wait nearly four years for the game to come out, due to the jump from the N64. However, the results are still exceptional. While its been argued that RE0 is still flawed and failed to offer anything drastically new to the Resident Evil saga, it is still very much fun nonetheless.The game follows the events one day prior to those that took place during the mansion incident, when the Bravo Team was ultimately wiped out. One of its survivors, Rebecca Chambers, meets up with Billy Coen, an escaped convict. The story attempts to explain who established Umbrella and the origins of the T-Virus. While gamers were disappointed to know that it produced more questions than answers, RE0's story is more interesting than the RE remake. Also, the relationship between Rebecca and Billy is the most realistic in the entire series. Graphics-wise, its a masterpiece. Wine bottles move flawlessly, curtains flap in the wind, and dust trails behind you. The rain and water effects are also stunning. The sound is also welcome to one's ears. Silence is often utilized to instill impending fear, while the voice-acting has improved. The music is adrenaline-inducing when suddenly attacked, and calm during moments of relief. The graphics and sound create the perfect atmosphere, with some of the best audio-visual presentations of any game thus far.The Resident Evil series has always reinvented itself control-wise with each consecutive release, and Resident Evil Zero contains its share of unique gameplay. This time around, the magical item boxes are gone, which allows the player to drop items anywhere they please. Zero's zapping system gives you the ability to switch between characters on the fly. This inventory system will be clunky and frustrating to first-timers and even to RE veterans. It takes time getting used to. The game forces you to manage your items carefully between the two characters and make sure both remain alive. Its up to the player how to figure out puzzles using one or both characters. With Rebecca and Billy at your disposal, you can either go solo or team up on enemies, strategically saving ammo and each other. It isn't all perfect, however. At times, your computer-controlled partner may not respond to attacks accurately. Although the inventory and battle systems aren't perfectly polished, RE0 is the most innovative Resident Evil game since Nemesis.Resident Evil 0 is the least scariest of all the RE titles and it touches on all-too familiar territory. These reasons explain why it is also one of the least appreciated games. Managing the inventory will certainly turn people off, but another run through will definitely help you become better, it will make you like the game a lot more. The game's combat system is also cumbersome, but its fresh idea offers something new to the fold. By now, the RE series has grown old and overdone. It has come to a point to where the usual RE traditions have become too predictable, and the tried-and-true gameplay is just routine now. Even though Resident Evil 0 was not exactly the breakthrough title gamers and RE enthusiasts hoped it would be, it is not a bad game by any means. Avoid comparing it to other RE titles and simply enjoy what the game has to offer. Even after several years of the same zombie killing and puzzle solving, this Evil outing may still offer a night of fun.", "\"I must say since i am a RE fan, this one is highly impressive yet great! this tells how it all happen before the Mansion or the City.A series of bizarre grisly murders take place somewhere in Raccoon City, STARS Bravo team member \"\"Rebecca Chambers\"\" investagates a Train somewhere in a forrest near the city and discover what's causing the murders, she is helped by a rougue criminal named \"\" Billy\"\" and both must survive on the Train and in a secret mansion ( which is not the mansion from the original or remake).Excellent prequel that has tons of action, character switching mode, cool creatures including new zombies, and more suprises in store. A must own if you own a Gamecube and if your a Resident Evil fan.\"", "An interesting twist on the Resident Evil formula in that storage crates no longer exist, you play as two characters whom you can switch between at any moment, and you can now drop things when they become useless. However, it takes a couple steps back from the previously released remake of Resident Evil. No longer do you need to destroy the brain or burn a zombie to destroy it completely and while no storage crates is more realistic, it just creates a lot of needless backtracking to get a certain item you left somewhere. Also, while having two playable characters may sound good in theory, soon enough you'll just play as Billy thanks to his ability to take more punishment and use Rebecca as a sort of pack mule since she can carry more items. Not a bad game by any means, but not as good as the remake of Resident Evil.

This game stars Rebecca and Billy who team up, and have to find their way out of...guess...a mansion. This one tells you what went down before Resident Evil 1. The worst monster is the Leech Man, and he is a pain in the arse, he killed me more then anything, because you have to throw dumb burning wine bottles at him, and mostly miss and he runs at you, and it's hard to get distance so you can deploy a burn bottle, he's a jerk, other then him, the whole game is fun. I didn't need a walkthrough with this, unlike RE1. The puzzles can be figured out, after some simple thought. It comes on 2 discs, and is a must play for any Resident Evil horror fan.", "Other than having to get used to the tank like controls, and having to backtrack through a few places to fetch items, the game is pretty good. The puzzles and gameplay elements are well thought out and mixed very well, the zombies and monsters are fun to fight against, and the 2D atmosphere with it's bland and dark colors and creepy music, really sets the tone for a fun time moving through the game story and trying to figure out whats going on. Not a bad play through at all.", "RE0 is by far the best lookin re to date.  The graphics are fantastic.  JUST PLAY TRAIN MISSION AND YOULL SEE WHAT I MEAN.The story was very amusing.  A rookie cop who partners up with a cuvitctid criminal sounds pretty interisting.  The zombies look awsome but not as real as the remake.  It goes to show you that gamecube is not a kiddie system and should be taken seriously.That sad trueth is it is suppose to show you what happend before the mansion incedint but not that much shows you an indethp look at what happend before it.  It really didnt tell you that much except about a back look at the leech quenn( he is a dude if you didn't know)  But over all it is awsome.  I got this game when it first came out. oct,02, sadly i shoulda waited till it turned in to a 19.99 game but still is is awsome.  I recomend the remake the most.....You will not be dissapointed if you play the remake.  Billy coehen is my most favorite re character ever madeThey should use him for a movie.

The game has a simple Plot which I won't get into but I must say this is a great game but also a huge disapointment.The games biggest aspect was the story!  Alot of people wanted a really good, decent god honest truth on how this alstarted.  Well it really doesn't expect that this was more of a side story then the real thing.  The game gives you somethings like who did all those things in the Mansion in RE1 and some other plots but ultimatley there is just so many plot holes in the game.  The game had an ok story but I wish you could have more simpathy for Rebecca and Billy, which you do, but they don't show as much emotion as what Jill and Chris go through.  The game does feel like a side story then a real pure prequal/sequal.  The game also features some good twists which keeps you playing on and on but not good enough!  The game features some RE1 characters like Weskers and Enrico and some more characters that didn't have enough spot light in RE1 or RE0 either!  I mean it's a prequal you're suppose to show things before what happend man!  Like I said before..there is too much things left out.  Now that I got that out of the way..The gameplay is pretty solid like the rest of RE games and this one is no different.  The game is pretty good just as good as the Remake and has some really cool creatures that are not seen in any other RE game.  The Crimzin heads are gone but that doesn't take away the feel or fright you get from this game.  The game scores big time on music and I really loved the music in this game, especially the parts were you're in the saving room.  The game has some really memorable music and is one of my favorites in anygame other then Zelda Oot.Other then Music and gameplay the visuals in this game are abosolutley incredible and amazing.  One of the most memerable parts in the RE series is the Train scenario in RE0 which is absolutley amazing.  The graphics and background of the train station is just sooooo realistic.  The visuals score big time and are just as good if not better then the visuals on the Remake.  The zombies look even more realistic in RE0 then in REmake.  Simply...The graphics in this game are awesome and one of the best in the gamecube.  The weapons look just as good as the characters and I must say the character models for both Rebecca and Billy look incredible.  The visuals in this game Get a * just...Awesome..The new Zapping system is really great too.  It's a great addition to the RE series.  You can switch between partners to do puzzles and switch ammo, Guns and medicene.  The Zap system is a really fun to but do no think your characters will always be together NO-HO this game will have you fighting for your life...ALONE...in some parts in the game and that's another thing that I loved about RE0 is that when the two main characters are back together you'll feel somewhat...safe..In the game.  It's truly a great edition in the game.OVERALLGood-Great gameplay and tons of exploring-The new zapping system is awesome-The games story will keep few on the verge of playing all night to say how it all ends...don't!-The game has amazing visuals and one of the best on the gamecube-Switching guns, ammo ect makes it tricky but fun.-lots and lots of Puzzles to solve once again..fun aint it?..Bad-More like a side story then the real thing-some will be dissapointed on how this game ends..overall I mean.-The game can get annoying with the switching and zapping..The ugly-The last boss.ehehehOverallResident Evil had the chance to reveal everything and be one of the best RE ever but it fails...badly!  It's a great game but a huge dissapointment at the same time.  The game has amazing visuals, great gameplay, lots and lots memerable moments, great music, lots of cool boss battles and nice Puzzles added to it.  Besides the whole Zapping system and everything I mention the game should have revealed more.....This seemed like a big side story then a REAL DEAL prequal/sequal...Overall this game is great and...of course..a disspointment and I give it a..4.3 out of 5 stars..Lates", "\"Great graphics!!! Though kinda dissapointing in the script area, like the RE movie, I don't really care, it's Resident Evil!! At least it's got one great line, which some better RE games Don't have \"\"The name's Rebecca Chambers, but that's OFFICER Chambers to you! Ok, REBECCA!\"\" The only thing that bothers me about it is the guy in the dress. Why does he wear it? It doesn't explained!!\"", "\"I love the setting of the Train in the beginning, and I love how we get to see Rebecca's point of view and her side of the story. I love how you can switch back and forth between Billy and Rebecca and how this is the first resident evil \"\"co-op\"\"(sort of) of the series. Only thing I didn't like was that Billy and Rebbeca didn't kiss at the end :)\"", "This game is my favorite Resident Evil so far.  It's got beautiful graphics (okay they are scary, but hey they are supposed to be).  The ability to have two characters team up was an improvement I enjoyed.  I've said before in previous reviews I am less than stellar at playing video games and an edge like having a second charcter was great for me.The story did seem a little out there if you've played previous versions simply because it is supposed to be before Resident Evil and the story just doesn't seem like it is playing that way.However, I don't play these games for the story (don't shoot me but I don't).I like the new drop system they have included so you don't have to worry with finding a box to put things in, but I didn't like the fact that some of the weapons take up 2 spaces and you end up not able to carry much with you.  I'd have preferred being able to carry items such as first aid spray and herbs as multiple items like the bullets.  It may be unrealistic, but for convienence it would be great.  Especially considering the time limit on the game for bonus items.  You have to finish the game within a specified length of time to get certain special items.  For folks like me that don't sit down and play a game straight through you never qualify for those items.These things don't take away from the overall experience of the game.  For me this game was scary and I loved every minute of it.  I'm a grown woman and this game could still scare my blood pressure into the high figures.  I loved every minute of it:)I hope that the creator of these games will get a little smarter and decide to contract to all the consoles in future instead of signing on for just one.  I'd love to be able to play these games on the PS2 simply because I hate the Gamecube controller size.Overall, I LOVE THIS GAME!", "For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. One of the best video game series of all times. This game was released as a 2-disc GameCube exclusive.Story: While the original RE game starts with the Alpha team's story, Bravo team was sent in first but their story was never explained. The main character, Rebecca Chambers was just a helper in RE but now you get to find out what her story was and how she survived while the rest of the Bravo team did not. Bravo team is called in to investigate a series of grisly murders in the Arklay Mountains region outside of Raccoon City, same as the Alpha team later on. On the way to the scene, Bravo's helicopter malfunctions because of a sabotage and is forced to crash land in the forest. The team soon discovers an overturned military police transport truck, along with the mutilated corpses of two officers. The remaining bravo team members split up and Bravo team's field medic, Rebecca Chambers, finds a train stopped in the middle of the forest. She discovers the prisoner, Billy Coen that was being transported by the military police. The train starts moving uncontrollably. The two work together from then on, stopping the train before it crashes and discovering an underground research facility owned by Umbrella. Things aren't what they seem as they explore the facility, fighting all the creatures and insects from Umbrella's experiments. The game ends at the entrance to the mansion from the first RE game.Gameplay: Single player survivor horror. You control both Billy Coen and Rebecca Chambers, each having their own unique abilities and each needed to solve puzzles and advance the plot. The storage containers are gone from the original RE game so if you need an item and your inventory is full, you then drop an item and it is tracked on your map in case you need to go back and get it. Fighting is the same as the other RE games. You can shoot from a stationary position only. The weapons include various custom handguns, shotguns, magnums, sub-machine guns, grenade launchers, and close-combat knives. As for the characters abilities, you need to use Rebecca to mix chemicals and get into tight spaces (she is petite) while you need Billy to move large objects and use a lighter. The enemies include mutant insects, zombies, primates, and leeches.Conclusion: Controls are easy to use. Sound and graphics are both on par for GameCube quality. If you love the RE series, you will like this game. There are multiple difficulty settings and the game is quite challenging on the standard difficulty. Worth picking up if you still own a GameCube or it can be played on the Wii using a GameCube controller and memory card.", "Maybe I am biased since Resident Evil was my first Survival Horror experience(And actually the first game I stuck to long enough to actually finish as both characters). So, It didn't take much convincing to order this prequel to the series on the Game Cube.The game features Rebecca and Billy, the two main characters whom you will switch between through the game in order to complete it. Like most RE games, you will be shooting through hordes of Zombies and gathering items to solve a variety of puzzles. Despite the fact that there are puzzles in the game, they aren't overly complicated to figure out. In fact, you will probably be more challenged by the Zombies, than you will by the puzzles.As for the controls? You are either going to hate it or love it! There's no middle ground. If you are not used to classic Survival horror games, then there is a good chance the controls will just tick you off. If however you are an old skool survial horror gamer, then you will love the familiar tank controls. The same applies with cameras, The game lacks camera controls, however this adds to the games challenge.Loading times are a pain, but that's pretty common for classic survival horror games, and in fact: I would dare say it's a staple the genre."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04640725627541542, 0.015777528285980225, 0.06160721555352211, 0.026474468410015106, 0.001044374774210155, 0.01048949733376503, 0.02378198131918907, 0.019253408536314964, 0.021877942606806755, 0.03229968249797821, 0.007259875535964966, 0.033080413937568665, 0.042576659470796585, 0.00048099091509357095, 0.0019574034959077835, 0.04912722110748291, 0.04967876896262169, 0.007229638285934925, 0.007778602186590433, 0.059975042939186096, 0.04349849745631218, 0.04671468585729599, 0.033060137182474136, 0.03775890916585922, 0.04129214957356453, 0.03204997256398201, 0.030528966337442398, 0.04984816163778305, 0.04418829455971718, 0.049414701759815216, 0.05771006643772125, 0.01577749289572239]]}
