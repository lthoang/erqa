This mouse isn't for people with serious arthritis like my mom. This mouse requires intricate thumb function to use the left and right buttons and people like my mother will have a very difficult time using the thumb buttons.I had to return it because she was unable to use the thumb buttons at all. If the buttons where elsewhere on the device I think it would work better.", "This device does exactly what I expected and what was described.  I am tatally satisfied with this substitute for a plain mouse!", "I really hate this design as it's really awkward but I guess you can get used to it.  However, by the time you get used to it, it will start making your thumb hurt after extensive use.  But IF you have severe issues with regular or ergo mice, this is OK to use I guess.", "It is difficult to use this mouse with precision but it is much more comfortable than a regular mouse. My sore wrist did not hurt anymore using this mouse. The only problem is it broke in a few days. I sent it back and have been unable to get a new one.", "The handle cannot be angled at all, so if you have pain at that angle, well sorry no adjustment at all.I am sure for someone with no pain at that angle it's great.For me, it just didn't work out.", "\"This mouse provided some relief over a regular mouse.  I think angling the hand in a more \"\"pistol-grip\"\" manner is more natural.  However, after using it for awhile, I still developed strain because of the need to move the mouse around.For me, having a stationary input device is the best.  I have the Logitech TrackMan Wheel and I am loving it.  It takes only a day to get used to.  It is very fast and easy to use.  I would recommend a trackball over this 3M mouse.\"", "I bought this because of the ergonomic factor but I am having an awful time dealing with the sensitivity of the mouse. It's hard to click on things and the left/right click on one button is hard to use. Hope I can get used to it soon.", "I have used a Logitech Trackball mouse for years and I love it but when I'm doing a lot of mouse work (highlighting text to cut/paste it and move it around on documents) I start to feel the stress in my elbow and forearm from having my hand rolled over onto the trackball for so long. When using this joystick-type mouse, my hand and wrist is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to how it is when using the trackball and it seems to completely relieve that stress on my elbow and in my forearm. Maybe with extended use it might stress other areas or cause different stress in my elbow and forearm where I would need to periodically change back and forth between the two but for now it's a welcome relief. It didn't take very long for me to get used to and it's simple to use. The button on the top of the vertical column is both a left and right click button and there's a separate button on the vertical column for scrolling.", "I still use a regular mouse at work, but at home i use this one.  It really varies the motion and using the thumb as the primary button pressure is great once you get used to it.  The scroll bar on the trigger isn't as ergonomic or easy to use, but it is there if you need it.  I generally use page up/down anyway.", "I bought this for a person in my office who was having carpal tunnel problems.  This has been much better for him than the mouse.  It does however take some time to get used to maneuvering it.", "I'm on the computer 10-12 hours a day. I was hopeful that this device would help with my over-use issues in my right-hand. While I did experience some relief initially, almost a month later and I was back to square one, and the over-use issues had moved from my wrist to my upper hand.Might be helpful for temporary relief, but it is not a cure for tendinitis and over-use."], "Gamma": [0.16850514709949493, 0.06588645279407501, 0.06588947027921677, 0.06588645279407501, 0.03105614334344864, 0.06588645279407501, 0.06588645279407501, 0.06584223359823227, 0.06588645279407501, 0.03571514040231705, 0.06587338447570801, 0.06588645279407501, 0.17179977893829346], "Beta": [[0.1647849977016449, 0.12488846480846405, 0.1475343555212021, 0.18890513479709625, 0.1537998914718628, 0.005344622302800417, 0.04796310141682625, 0.00027830072212964296, 5.223049447522499e-05, 0.16049453616142273, 0.005954302381724119], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.163217231631279, 0.12658725678920746, 0.14581558108329773, 0.18438899517059326, 0.1515152007341385, 0.008834686130285263, 0.05319759622216225, 0.0008581637521274388, 0.00018355550128035247, 0.1586497575044632, 0.00675189308822155], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.1631832718849182, 0.12378239631652832, 0.14274698495864868, 0.18334372341632843, 0.14945672452449799, 0.010447259992361069, 0.05984211340546608, 0.0010328232310712337, 0.0002609386865515262, 0.1563776284456253, 0.009526246227324009], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.163215771317482, 0.1265890747308731, 0.145814448595047, 0.18438325822353363, 0.1515136957168579, 0.008835900574922562, 0.05320693552494049, 0.0008586953044869006, 0.00018365486175753176, 0.1586458534002304, 0.006752737332135439], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.1633003205060959, 0.1242685317993164, 0.14323431253433228, 0.18349744379520416, 0.14980150759220123, 0.010132996365427971, 0.058829788118600845, 0.001003382378257811, 0.0002454318746458739, 0.15673092007637024, 0.008955261670053005], [0.1632167398929596, 0.12658748030662537, 0.14581531286239624, 0.18438787758350372, 0.15151485800743103, 0.00883544608950615, 0.05319877341389656, 0.0008583005983382463, 0.00018359028035774827, 0.15864919126033783, 0.0067523992620408535], [0.16321717202663422, 0.12658736109733582, 0.14581555128097534, 0.18438884615898132, 0.15151511132717133, 0.008834851905703545, 0.053197797387838364, 0.0008581994916312397, 0.0001835640869103372, 0.1586497277021408, 0.006751925218850374], [0.16482146084308624, 0.12483622878789902, 0.14757521450519562, 0.18902361392974854, 0.1538563221693039, 0.005270898342132568, 0.047824110835790634, 0.00026980196707881987, 5.045428770245053e-05, 0.1605386584997177, 0.005933251231908798]]}
