I also loved using the hacking aspect and giving my character a sword.", "Worth buying if your a fan of the movies and the animatrix series. But wished they had a HD reboot of this game with path of neo. Regardless still a good game.", "This is an excellent game brought out by Atari, and developed by Shiny. Speaking of graphics this game has them. The game runs at a smooth frame rate even during large fights. Contrary to what the box says, this game does in fact have multiplayer. It can be acessed by unsing a cheat code in the hacking mode. The fighting sequences are awsome and the action is very fast and furious. You can play through the game using two different characters, Ghost and Niobe, both of whom make appearances in the newley relseased film. To top it off the game packs in a little over an hour of never before seen fotage from the film and also a short trailer for the third and final Matrix movie. I my opinion the unreleased footage from the movie is worth the money. Another cool feature of the game is the ability to enter and exit slow motion at your onw pleasing. In slow motion, you can see the famous bullet time effect and you can dodge them. Overall an excellent game, with only one drawback which would be some graphical glitches.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Replayibility: 5/10Multiplayer: 1-2 Players (With cheat)Online: No", "This game too is one that I purchased for my cousins, and they like it a lot, so it is safe to say that it is a great play.", "\"Never has a movie based game been as good as Enter the Matrix. This has very fast paced kung-fu fights, awsome looking slow-motion gunfights, sweet car chases, and adenline-pumping agent encounters. It also has an hour of exclusive footage done with actors from The Matrix: Reloaded and has very close ties with the movie. You cant fully understand the movie without this game, and you cant understand alot of this game without also seeing the movie. The action is uncomparable to any other game on the market of that genre, unlike most action games where you go through each level shooting everything, here you can get up close and do complicated and fast disarm moves and unleash a devistaing series of punches kicks. The focus(Bullet Time) move has never before been used so well in a game. In Max Payne, you could barely see the bullets fly through the air, but in Enter the Matrix they are big, shiny, and leave a trail of soundwaves behind them, making it an awsome experience to dodge them or fire them. Also, when using focus you can run faster, jump inhumanly long distances, run up walls and 360 kick someone of of it, and do many other special moves not available in regular speed. The car chases are not quite as good as those in a James Bond game, but are still pretty good. The interactivity with the enviroment is the thing that stands out from all the other car chases in video games: Streetsigns fall when shot at, those annoying \"\"Your speed is ____, the speed limit is ____\"\" signs explode when driven past at 100mph, windows shatter when you crash into buildings, but there is an awful lot of fog when doing this, and a little amount of innocent traffic in places where there is supposed to be swarms of them, like on the highway. While the car chases arnt perfect, the gunfights are almost so. Focus moves are extremely important to this game, and unlike max payne, is not just a thing to make it look cool. You can barely hit a wall while running and jumping in normal speed, but when you turn on focus, your accurasy boosts much higer because of the slower moving targets, you can pinpoint the heart of a guard after running up a wall and somersaulting off it and then diving headfirst over a deep gap. The slow motion gameplay makes this a blasts, and not only is it used in gunfights, but it also makes your kicks, punches, and throws faster and more stronger, this is very essential when fighting an agent, vampire, or Seraph, in fact its almost impossible to win a boss fight without using a few focus moves somewhere in there. The fighting engine is also great, this could be a great fighting game, only they decided to make it better with the gunfights. There is a wide range of kics, punches, combos, and focus moves, and each one is slightily different whether you have a weapon out or not, for example, when you try a throw move while unarmed, Niobe/Ghost will pick up the opponent and throw them, but while armed, he/she will grab them by the neck, crack it a bit, drop them outward and shoot the opponet in the neck at a point blank range. The liscensing here is also used just as good as the Star Wars series used it's. You will fight many opponents from the Matrix movies, and some that barely made an apperance in reloaded become much more complicated and deep in this game, particualrily the vampires. There are also some heart-pounding agent encounters, imagine, running down the streets of chinatown whith eight agents behind you, all of a sudden, another one jumps out from a window in front, backing away, you quickly turn around and run the only open rode you see and find yourself diving through the window of a tire shop, the owner crouches down and whimpers, you run to the back about to open the door, when you hear some strange noise coming from the owner, you look and an agent stands where the owner was crouching, you elbow open the locked door and quickly run to the pay phone ahead, but all of a sudden someone throws a grenade and it blows up. The chase continues on and eventually you find yourself running across rooftops, sprinting up stairs, and diving through glass. With such great agent chases, forget The Getaway, Enter the Matrix is the most movielike game out now.\"", "wow. i played this game long time ago! but still very impressed with the slow motion and bullet time effects and the graphics! very cool", "When I first bought Enter the Matrix I was hooked.  Hears why. Imagine being surrounded by four guards, and they are closing in.  In most games you'd be screwed in a position like this, but not in Enter the Matrix.  One guard comes in to grab you but with a front kick and an upper cut you easily take him out.  Two other guards charge in, but you take down one with a flurry of punches, and you grab the other guard and throw him into a wall, knocking him out.  The last guard runs in quickly and try's to kick you but you run up the adjacent wall land behind him a crack his Neck with one stroke.  Oh yeha and you did all this with only using three buttons.  Now do you see why I am hooked?  But sadly there is a bad part.  First off the graphics Suck. They're not as bad as an N64 game but they come close at times. Second off there is a friggin save screen about every two minutes, if you are lucky maybe five minutes. Last off the game does not have the best replay value; sure the fighting kicks ass, and it is addicting, but the story is farley boring, and you may not want to sit through it again.  One other thing I'm wondering about is why are there so many guns.  There are four different types of pistols yet they all do the same thing.  But in a happier note, Enter the Matrix is a good game, being able to play as two Characters (Niobe, Ghost) is cool and the driving parts our ok but you may want to rent this game first.  The game is very addicting for the first couple of days but after that it will become an average game in your gaming library.", "Well at one time or another we all dream of doing the cool things in the Matrix but since we can't they did the next best thing, make of video game about it.  Whats cool about the game is that they shoot actual live footage for that's in the game only, you wont see thisstuff in The Matrix Reloaded.  So it has it's own story line that adds on to The Matrix Reloaded and whats cool about it is that you wont know the story unless you play the game (Wonder what the other charters besides NEO were doing?  Wonder no more).  This is by far the best game thats based off a movie.  One other cool thing, when you beat the game you get to see a trailer to the Matric Revolutions.Okay now about the game play, well basically you are fast as hell and you can't beat everyone down that is normal.  There's a button that lets you slow things down and do all that cool slow motion action. You only get to play as two characters Niaomi and Ghost, I didn't mind much, I mean if you got to play as NEO you would either already no the story from watching the Movie or you would spoil the movie. The basics of the game is to beat everyone down, there isn't really a strategy.Bad Points- Sometimes your characters stays locked on to NPC that are already dead and you get your ass kicked by the baddies and it is only sometimes, not all the time.- Load time is horrible and the levels are pretty short, oh when you die, you have to load all over again and start from the begining.  (Ya it sucks)- There's a part in the game where the voices start echoing, it gets very annoying.Good Points (End with positives)- You get to fight Trinity- You get cool moves with the touch of a button- Awesome weaponsThat's all I can think of at the moment, now the big question 'Should you I buy it?'  Well I don't know, if you a big Matrix fan you probably already have it and if you don't you should buy it.  If you're not, well... you will have to decide on your own.  Is Slow motion and a whole lot of gun fire and fighting really worth the money?", "\"Enter The Matrix brings gamers into the world of the matrix. The game is a lot of fun for all Matrix lovers such as myself. You have the...kicking kun-fu action of the movies. You really get to kick a lot of [bad guys] in this game, it's just a very fun and fast paced game. You don't get to pick Neo, Morphious or Trinity but you get to choose between 2 other characters from the new movies. You don't get to choose Neo because he's the one, he's too strong. Mean that's the excuse I read in a video game magazine to why you can't pick him anyway. Not sure why you can't pick Morphious or Trinity at least though.The characters that you get to use a very cool anyway. I don't know much about them since I didn't see The Matrix Reloaded yet but still they do all the kun-fu...kicking stuff so that's good enough for me to like them, haha. Just take the advice of a character in the first film though \"\"when you see an agent you run\"\". You can easily beat the...cops and other people in the game but only Neo can take on the agents. I tried to fight an agent and he destroyed me easily so don't try that, haha. Anyway if you like the Matrix films then this is the game you got to get.\"", "\"First off, after reading a lot of the review below, I caught myself wondering if we were talking about the same game. Graphics? \"\"Unbelievable??\"\" - Either someone is pulling the consumer's chain or these reviewers have not played very many video games in their life. The graphics are sub-par. Mediocore at best. The level design is very average and bland with little to be real excited about. The character models are OK, but again, rather bland.But the issue here is gameplay. While at times, the gameplay is fun (e.g. fighting agents or a couple bad guys at once) sometimes, the gameplay is just plain annoying. Mostly due to the very poor control setup. Using your weapons in the game (e.g. pistols, shotguns) is pretty much useless. Targeting barely works at all and it all feels very clunky and awkward. Most of the game I found myself fighting with my hands, just to avoid using the weapons.The Story: \"\"Who Cares?\"\" That is the question. We are thrown into a story that is barely coherent to begin with and on top of that, we get to play as 2 characters that we don't know, and most importantly, don't like. I have no interest in playing with either of these characters. Not letting us play with Morpheus, Trinity or Neo is simply, a smack in the face.Anyway, It's not all bad. Some levels are quite fun to play...beating up every guy you see and trying to pull off cool \"\"bullet-time\"\" moves on them. This, in my opinion, is the redeeming quality of the game and earns 2 of it's 3 stars. The other star is earned by the effort that went into putting the dvd quality cut scenes into the game and having the game work around those.In summary, This can be a fun game at times, it can also be annoying. I suggest renting it to see if you're going to like it or not before shelling out the 50 bones for it. If you ask me, this game is nowhere near the ground breaking game it was hyped up to be. Oh so you have Bullet Time? Ever play Max Payne?\"", "\"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. I grew up on Philip K. Dick novels, and the whole Matrix concept is one I've always loved. I thought the movie's plot, characters and special effects were great. Also, I'm a big fan of Splinter Cell and played it many times. I've always loved the Bond style games where you work your way through a level, finding objectives and taking out the bad guys.So while I really, really wanted to be blown away by Enter the Matrix, I just wasn't. It was a GOOD game, but not nearly as good as it should have been - not nearly as good as many other games that are out right now. I almost wonder if they rushed the game into production to match the timing of the movie, instead of finishing up some much-needed polishing.First, the good parts. It was directed by the Wachowski brothers and features the quite talented actors and actresses from the movies. It really ties in to the movie and sort of 'immerses' you in the experience. So that is quite neat. They do have Matrix-time \"\"focus\"\", much like in Dead to Rights, where you can temporarily slow time and do cool moves. Just like in Dead to Rights, it seems cool at first and is hardly used in actual gameplay.Gameplay is intriguing. You're given general objectives but then have to figure out how to get to them. So you're not exactly led by the nose. There are sometimes big rooms with lots of directions, lots of offices, lots of choices. Still, the game is about getting from Point A to Point B. I definitely miss Vice City's free-roam ability.I was pretty disappointed by the graphics. There are many other games out right now with truly STELLAR graphics, and this isn't one of them. Objects vanish from the screen. The rendering just isn't very good, compared to other games we play quite a bit. The physics models are a bit bizarre. People slide like hockey pucks across the floor. You can leap on some things but not on others, apparently at random.The sound has serious issues. My brand new CD right from the store started double-talking almost immediately in several scenes. Also, one of the hallmarks of a great game is that the sound is context sensitive - quiet and brooding at times, thundering at the exciting parts. But this game is ALWAYS thundering. It gets very monotonous after a while and completely destroys the atmosphere.The load time is incredibly long, and many missions are incredibly short. There are times that you almost load longer than you get to play that mission area! With the instant-reheal-totally, the instant-restart-10-seconds-ago and the lack of challenging enemies to fight, most of the game is a cakewalk.Add to that the quite annoying aspect that there are times that a door won't open until you kill all enemies in the room. So you go around and check the doors, but you have to slay everyone there before the \"\"special door\"\" will open up. Yes, some games use that technique. But this game in general is supposed to be a realistic adventure. In realistic adventures, doors don't sense when all enemies are dead and then spring open.AI, one of THE most important parts of any game, is spotty at best. Sometimes the guards hide behind cover. Sometimes they stand in the open when cover is right next door. I've had cases where a guard stood pointing a gun at a door even though I was right behind him, pounding the stuffing out of 2 of his friends. He didn't even turn around until I bashed him in the head.And finally, the camera is just plain annoying. Every friend I've had try this game says the same thing. They all play tons of adventure and action games. Somehow this game just does a bad job with positioning the camera anywhere useful.The game really had a great deal of potential and I think with another month or two in QA testing it could have shone. But there are many, many areas that appear to have gotten through in a \"\"good enough\"\" state instead of a \"\"ready for prime time\"\" state.Yes, I'll play the game. And yes, I'll see the movies many, many times and talk about them endlessly with my programmer / hacker friends. But I do feel let down that with all of the money and talent available to the Wachowski brothers, they didn't give this game the attention it merited. They focussed on the MOVIE aspect of the game, but not the GAME aspect.\"", "this game is a fun game the graphics are pretty good and you'll enjoy playing it. It did feel like your mostly just along for the ride rather then the main character it is linear but it is fun.", "\"When Enter the Matrix came out alongside the Matrix Reloaded, it got caught up in all the disappointment surrounding the movie sequel, and was bombarded with negative reviews from critics.  Well, neither the two movie sequels nor the game deserve all of the criticism they often get, and, at a low price, Enter the Matrix warrants a purhase.You play as either Ghost or Niobe, (two comparitively minor characters from Reloaded and Revolutions), through a story that begins before Reloaded, and weaves in and out of it, ending at the start of Revolutions.  Through exclusive movie cut scenes, (which the Wachowski brothers wrote and filmed with all the real actors exclusively for this game - you won't find many of them anywhere else) some of the events in Reloaded are better explained.As for the gameplay, it is played from a third-person perspective, and is generally quite fun.  At worst, it is an average third-person shooter/beat 'em-up.  At best, you ARE playing the Matrix films.  Combat is divided up between shooting enemies with a handful of weapons, and hand-to-hand martial arts combat, just like the three films.  By using Focus, (slow-mo, \"\"bullet time\"\") many more fancier moves become available.  Dive in to a gun fight, propel off a nearby wall into a kick to the head, and of course, run along walls, and jump off guns blazing.  Press against corners, and jump out to fire off a shot or two - the combat is generally fun, but the gunplay gets boring pretty quickly.  Hand-to-hand combat is awesome though, and the animation is top-notch.  During martial arts confrontations the camera will swing around to your side for a more cinematic feel, and rotate a bit like the fight scenes in the movies, but it won't interfere with the combat, since it's really just a button masher at its heart.  Fun though, and true to the spirit of the films.  Still, many of the moves, like hanging from pipes by your legs to shoot enemies below, will only be used once, if at all.Also, occasionally you will run in to some glitches, and might even need to reset the game.  Once it froze during a loading screen, and once my character got permanently stuck beneath the floor of an elevator I was supposed to be in.  Annoying?  Sure.  But the glitches won't ruin your overall experience.The graphics aren't anything special, but they certainly aren't horrible.  Some of the in-game cinematics (the ones that use the in-game graphic's engine) look awful, but some of them look picture perfect.What Enter the Matrix does best, however, is that it truly feels like the movies.  Right down to the details.  The green tint on all levels within the Matrix; the way pillars crumble when shot, and characters interact with the environment (throw a character in to a book shelf, and books will come tumbling out); the music, taken directly from the films, the costumes, and lighting; even the fitting (although boring) cheat system: computer hacking.  Everything comes together to make this a very believable Matrix experience.Some levels are far too short, and some aren't really fun at all, such as the sewer levels, but all in all, this is pretty much waht you'd expect from a game based on the Matrix.\"", "\"I hate it when every one of you go \"\"Dis game is nothing comp@R3D TO THE MOVIE! HAR-HAR-HAR!\"\" I loved this game. Not as good as the movie, but by a short hair.GAMEPLAY: 10/10 Great slo-mo action, and You can play as either Ghost or Niobe. They both rock. :)!GRAPHICS: 6/10: Not the best, but still good.SLOW MOTION: 10/10: Sucks that it's limited, but It's still all food. IT's best to shoot in slow mo so then you know who and where you're shooting.SOUND: Music's great. Dialouge and Sound can be a  little corny, though.OVERALL: Very good. Give it a shot!\"", "\"At first, I was apprehensive of playing this title.  Most of the time, games based from movies, TV shows, and cartoons are nowhere near the same calibre as that of originals.  They're just a way for the companies that franchise the name to make a quick buck.  But that all changed when I got behind the controller and entered the Matrix....Enter the Matrix features some of the best animated martial arts I've seen in a game.  The real-life mapping of the moves leaves you laughing in astonishment as your characters punch, kick, and flip enemies with incredible accuracy.  The game also features a slew of guns, from pistols, to submachineguns, even sniper rifles and grenades, all used to dispatch your foes.  Plus, it features a gauge similar to that of Max Payne's \"\"Bullet Time\"\" where you can slow the action down to dodge gunfire and perform even more stunning hand-to-hand combat moves on your opponents.Rent this game if you can.  It will definitly be worth your time to check it out.  And, if you're happy there, go ahead and buy it!\"", "I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool. I felt bad that I had paid $ to view an ad for Matrix 3. I felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring. It was exceptionally easy.The only good thing about the game was that the CGI in the game matched the terrible CGI in the movie, so I felt like I was actually playing the movie.If you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie. Don't waste your time or money if you're interested in gameplay.", "Enter The Matrix is a very fun game to play. There are some cool levels to play through,using awesome hand to hand combat,and some bad a** guns to shoot the bad dudes with. I highly recommend this to Matrix fans,and to gamers that like a great action game.", "This game is to be  commended on a few things. 1)It's ability to show you what their was no time to show in The Matrix Reloaded film. 2)The amazing film like quality of the cut-scenes that actually do give some insight into the events of the film. (P.S. Be sure to beat Seraph for the most revealing part of the entire game) 3)It does help one to live the fantasy of actually being in the movie. You can do all the neat things you've seen in the movie and it provides a bit of a rush if you're REALLY into the matrix films.4)The in-game graphics are decent enough and the environments look really cool. 5)The fighting can vary enough so it's not boring, the gun play is wicked cool, and nothing feels finer than destroying an army of military men with your one man/woman army.Now onto the bad, for this game IS very flawed.1)While the cut-scenes are incredible the game graphic cut scenes are a joke, you laugh as they switch from real life to cut scene and how ugly it really looks.2)The Driving car, and logos levels (Especially the final logos level which is unbelievably glitchy and it's impossible to see where you are going, in the Niobe game.) feel rushed and rather than add a vary in the game playing they become tedious and boring levels you wish would end so you can resume having fun again.3)It does feel rushed at times, and the levels (the airport, the sewer, and the powerplant for example) sometimes seem to just go ON AND ON with no end in sight, they easily grow tiresome and you again just wish it to end so you can resume having fun.4)The automatic save feature picks alot of strange places and times to save, while it is convenient so that you don't have to play an entire level again, it seems to happen too frequently and can at times feel slow.This is a split down the middle choice. It is better than 90% of all movie to game translations, but it is in no way perfect. Only get this if you love the matrix movies, and can let go of these  flaws in order to live out the movie. It can be fun alot of the times, and has a great deal of cool moments where you break into fights and they punch out the techno music. Those make it a worth while purchase in the end.P.S. It  ends as abrutly as the film did. Very anti-climactic. Although the Revolutions trailer in the game is far superior to the one playing in theatres.", "ENTER THE MATRIX is an interesting game. Probably over half of the games of the past were movie tie-ins. However, I don't recall a game being so tied to a film series as ENTER THE MATRIX. While playing the game, you basically are allowed to take a part in the movies. The game fills in many plot holes left between MATRIX: RELOADED and MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS. Plus, once you beat the game it has one of the best previews for MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS that were available.I enjoyed playing this game and had a lot of fun. I defeated the Ghost course over in a little over four hours and the Niobe course in about five. I think the Ghost sequence is a bit more difficult, but I played the Niobe level first and it took me time to get used to the control of the game.My favorite part of the game is after you beat the game, you are able to enter into a two person combat mode. In this mode you are able to choose several different characters to fight with someone else. My brother and I have a blast playing these levels.  One of our favorites is the police car versus the fire car. Seeing the two cars fight for the first time is absolutely hilarious.The game is pretty easy to play, but also a lot of fun. Many hard core gamers do not like it because they find it too easy, but it's a great game for a novice or average gamer.  Also recommended for Matrix fans.", "\"There is little doubt that this is going to be one of the top games of 2003. The December 2002 Game Informer Magazine gave this a full-length feature, and it left little doubt that this is going to be a powerhouse game.

ETM's plot runs parallel to the events of the Matrix Reloaded.  The gameplay in this game I thought was very fun and exhilirating but soon got a little repetitive.  What really brings this game down are the numerous bugs and pathetically designed driving and flying levels.  Some of the many bugs include echoeing voices during cutscenes (making it virtually impossible to understand what they're saying), players actually can get stuck in one place, all because of a glitch.  There are some parts on the game that actually freeze (everytime you get to that point) making it impossible to even complete the game, on some retail copies that is.  The enviroments are lacking texture and depth.  The levels are dull and unimagitave.  The driving and flying missions are just horrendous.  The driving physics are all out of wack; when you hit a bump you go flying in the air and normally land on your side or hit a wall.  The flying mission lacked any kind of ingenuity.  It was extremely easy and boring.  After a time (on a normal mission) your health regenerates automatically making the game very easy.  Although this game does have its upsides.  It has nearly an hour of actual exclusive movie fotage, a cool cheat/hacking system, and awesome looking but easy to perform fighting.  It took me about 4 hours to beat it with each character.
