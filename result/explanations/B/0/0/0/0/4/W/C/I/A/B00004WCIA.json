It's small enough to comfortably carry it in a shirt or coat pocket. I power it with four AA lithiums to keep weight as low as possible. Despite its small size, the recycling time is amazingly fast, 0.1 to 4.5 seconds with alkaline AA batteries or 0.1 to 2.5 seconds with rechargeable batteries. That's faster than both the 420EX and the 550EX!The shoe lock of the 220EX is fast and simple to use. Once mounted, you simply flip a small latch to lock it. Much more convenient than the thumbwheel found on some Speedlites.Although compact, the 220EX is surprisingly powerful and full featured: GN 72.6 feet (22m) at ISO 100, 28mm full frame coverage (17 or 18mm APS-C), near-infrared AF assist light, flash exposure confirmation light, E-TTL, TTL, second-curtain sync, FE Lock (flash exposure lock), flash exposure compensation and FP Flash (high speed sync). You won't notice most of these features as the control panel is nearly barren: on-off switch, ready light, FP Flash switch and flash exposure confirmation light. FE Lock, flash exposure compensation and second-curtain sync are controlled from the camera. To access all flash features you need a camera with a flash menu, e.g., Elan 7 series, 3, 1V and most EOS DSLRs.The 220EX was discontinued in 2009, so does it work with newer cameras? Yes, it works fine with any EOS using E-TTL flash metering, e.g., , all EOS DSLRs. I used the 220EX on a 5D, 5D MKII, 6D, 7D, 40D, 50D and 60D and it performed like a champ.Where the 220EX falls down slightly is compatibility with flash menus of newer EOS. With the 6D, the menu can set FEC, second curtain sync, toggle between E-TTL II and Averaging, set sync speed in Av mode and disable flash firing (with AF assist enabled). Flash bracketing, manual power and custom functions are grayed out. High speed sync (FP Flash) can only be set on the flash itself. The 60D, 7D and 5D MKII are the same as the 6D except sync speed can't be set in Av mode.Focusing in the dark is quick and discreet thanks to the near-infrared AF assist light. The AF assist light has a range of about 16 feet (5m). With the 220EX mounted, low light AF is vastly improved. Unfortunately, the AF assist light of the 220EX only covers the center AF area. It affords no slide sensor coverage for multiple AF arrays such as the 5D MK II or 7D. However, the top, center and bottom sensors are covered by the AF assist beam. With 45-sensor arrays--e.g., EOS 1V or 3--it only seems to work with the center AF sensor. Nevertheless, I find the near-infrared AF assist light a welcome feature and greatly preferable over the disco strobe AF assist of the 270EX.This Japan made flash was discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the 270EX. Why buy a 220EX when you can get a newer design like the 270EX for $150? For most buyers it's all about the near-infrared AF assist and/or a bargain price of old stock or used. In my experience of dropping a lot of Speedlites, the single piece design is stronger than two piece units. However such strength means no swivel and tilt so look elsewhere if you need these features. Of course, you could use an off-shoe cord and use your hand or a bracket for bounce functions.I bought my 220EX in 1999 for $125 and, nearly 15 years later, it's still going strong. If you need a basic compact flash with E-TTL features, the 220EX is a great choice. It is a perfect travel companion due to its petite size. I refuse to let go of mine because it's the smallest E-TTL Speedlite available with near-infrared AF assist. The 220EX is a wonderful blend of simplicity and power in a petite package that fits in your pocket.", "I bought my G6 in December, borrowed a Canon 420 EX speedlite and liked the results but I wondered if the smaller, lighter, less expensive 220 EX would be good enough?  Some of the reviews here say it is underpowered.  Is it?  I bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in 8 PM darkness to try them at 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet and 40 feet on the G6.Conclusion #1:  The G6 has a good builtin flash.  It makes good images within it's limited range of 5 meters/16 feet (or 4 meters/13 feet when the lens is set to telephoto) and works well as a fill flash.  Complete failure beyond 20 feet.Conclusion #2:  The 420EX (range 24.2 meters) and the 220EX (range 15.7 meters/51.5 feet) both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range.  But both are limited by the autofocus range of 5 to 7 meters.  That's right, neither flash can focus on a subject more than 20 feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto.  Both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at 40 feet.Final Conclusion:  I'm keeping the 220 EX.  The G6 is small and light, so is the 220EX.  They make a good team, but the G6 also does well alone up close.", "A great flash and it really compliments my new Canon Camera.  I have used this numberous times and have not been disappointed with the results.", "I notice another reviewer called the Speedlite 220 the perfect companion for your G1; I thought of it as the perfect companion for my G2. Whichever camera you have, the Speedlite 220 is indeed the perfect way to get better illuminated flash photos and extend battery life in your G-series camera.The single most important thing you can do to get rid of red eye and insure that your flash photography subjects don't have that flat, pasty-faced, deer-caught-in-the-headlights look is to seperate the camera from the flash. (You'll need Canon's off-camera extension cord for this) You can shoot with the camera in one hand and hold the flash in the other, or use a bracket to hold them. Or you can get creative, bouncing the flash off the walls, lighting behind your subject, etc. It's great for providing fill flash on sunny days, lighting shadows- and with digital cameras it costs you next to nothing to experiment with lighting and get immidiate feedback.The 220 talks to all the G-series cameras (as well as all modern Canon SLRs) so you can concentrate on lighting and composition and let the camera worry about exposure. Add a couple sets of rechargeable AA cells and a small charger- cheap these days- and you have an inexpensive but powerful lighting studio. Some may recoil at the price- after all, you can get a tiny flash unit for half or a quarter the cost- but the ability to integrate withe the camera electronics are well worth it.", "I purchased this flash to use with my Canon G1 digital camera.  When using the latest Canon camera lines there is a huge benefit in going with the Canon &quot;EX&quot; flashes, as they deliver E-TTL metering.  Without boring you, the essence of this is that when you press the shutter button the flash is momentarily fired so the camera can measure the actual light and determine the best exposure, and then it fires the flash again and takes the actual picture (all in a fraction of a second).  Sorry, if you don't have a Canon camera, you don't get E-TTL.Why is this important?  Because it is measuring the real light and not estimating what might be needed or trying to turn off the flash while it takes the picture when it thinks enough light has been delivered.  Its complicated, but trust me you're pictures will be a lot better.Now the 220EX model is Canon's smallest and lightest.  You can opt for other Canon models (380EX is discontinued, 420 EX, 550EX), and you'll get higher light output (so you can use flash from more than 100 feet away), and swivel/tilt so you can bounce flash - but at the added cost of larger size, more weight, and more cost.The 220EX also provides a long battery life (check out Amazon's price on Kodak photolife batteries) - I seem to get well more than 300 shots per set of AAs.  And it also manages power by shutting down the flash after inactivity.The 220EX makes sense for any smaller Canon camera, or even a larger one where the photographer is less likely to use flash form more than 70 feet away or use bounce flash capability.  If that sounds like you, then buy this flash.  Its a winner.", "This is a basic flash that makes all the decisions for you-it's auto only. However, the fixed flash head does not allow bounce flash which to me is a deal breaker. Indoor shots can be so beautiful and evenly lit with bounce flash, but this unit is just a better version of what's built in to the Rebel or G series, complete with harsh lighting and blown out detail. It's too bad Canon feels this is a good entry level flash-Nikon has the very basic SB-400 for a similar price, but has bounce ability and is much more powerful than a built in speedlight.", "I was waiting on this flash unit and then I got a message informed me that they canceled the order .", "I ordered this flash as a replacement for a 420ex (that I was borrowing from a good colleague). The minute I opened I had the ominous feeling that it was going to be a disappointment. Indeed! The very first test shots were incredibly telling as to how lousy and shoddy this flash is. First, it does not swivel so you can kiss your hopes for bounce flash goodbye. Second, it's lacks punch and power. In many of the informal tests I performed, the built-in flash of my camera (and even that of a point-and-shoot I have lying around the studio) is more powerful!!!!!! I re-packed it and sent it back. Got a 430ex and am nothing but satisfied. In short, stay away from this flash! In this case you won't even get what you paid for--avoid!"], "Gamma": [0.10688866674900055, 0.11484377831220627, 0.10688866674900055, 0.10688866674900055, 0.10688866674900055, 0.10688866674900055, 0.10688866674900055, 0.10689029097557068, 0.13693399727344513], "Beta": [[0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0009700815426185727, 0.0007560162921436131, 0.28774294257164, 8.907391020329669e-05, 0.00010930618736892939, 0.3202318251132965, 0.276271790266037, 0.11382890492677689], [0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0008985565509647131, 0.0007317313575185835, 0.28703439235687256, 0.0001228518522111699, 9.933317051036283e-05, 0.31639131903648376, 0.27800124883651733, 0.11672050505876541], [0.0008985713357105851, 0.0007317361305467784, 0.2870345711708069, 0.00012284339754842222, 9.933523688232526e-05, 0.316392183303833, 0.2780008614063263, 0.11671987920999527], [0.0012296250788494945, 0.0008359731873497367, 0.2896869480609894, 3.276583811384626e-05, 0.00014701591862831265, 0.33215874433517456, 0.27071452140808105, 0.10519438236951828]]}
