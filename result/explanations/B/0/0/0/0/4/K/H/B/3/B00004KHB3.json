I've seen this so many times between the three games ~ people expect them to be similar, so when they play a new one they are extremely disappointed because they were expecting it to be like the previous game they played.Baldur's Gate is character and dialogue driven. It is extremely non-linear and allows you to wander around and do things at your own pace in whatever order you choose (reasonably).Neverwinter Nights is focused on creating and managing only one main character and is a mix between linear and non-linear. It has limitless custom content and roleplaying potential.Icewind Dale is very linear and is combat and strategy based. The battles here are far superior to the ones in BG or NWN. They are well-balanced and always challenging. They require planning, thinking, strategizing and ample use of the pause button. It's not an easy game but that is what makes it so much fun. Of course, it's not friendly to newcomers, which is one reason many people dislike it so quickly (i.e. they suck at it).The music in IWD is phenomenal and one of the best video game soundtracks. The sound effects and superb and the game is full of brilliant art, level design and atmosphere. This is a game I keep coming back to, over and over again, because it has such high replay value and exciting combat. It's very different each time, based on difficulty and party composition.", "If you like good, American-style D&D; RPG's with tons of fast battles, then Icewind Dale (based on Bioware's Infinity Engine--also used in BG1) is for you!  The overall pace of the game is much faster and less tedious than BG1 and Tales of the Swordcoast.  The price is great, there's a lot to see and do and plenty of monsters to kill!  You'll definitely use the save function a lot in this game, but you won't find yourself getting frustrated as the difficulty seems pretty well balanced out.At this price...you can't go wrong by buying this title if you missed out on it or if Baldurs Gate II is a little out of your price range.  Lots of great gaming for a low price!!", "As a fan of the Baldur's Gate series, I decided to give Icewind Dale (IWD) a try.  Unfortunately, Black Isles did not strike gold twice.  While Icewind Dale is a carbon copy of their excellent Baldur's Gate games in many ways, it lacks the personality that make the BG series great.IWD actually has a number of things in its favor.  The character creation system is very rich, allowing you to customize your party of six in true D&D; fashion.  Also, there is a long list of abilities, spells, and equipment that you'll run across, as well as visually appealing environments, solid voice acting, and compelling music.  Some of the dungeons can be genuinely creepy, and there's a sense of accomplishment once you clear one out.Unfortunately, the game is deeply flawed.  IWD is a bit too hard, even for a person who has some experience with RPG dungeon-crawling.  Even worse, it's an artificial toughness designed to lengthen the game by requiring you to repeatly reload saved games.  Your characters will die countless times, and this simply can't be avoided.  And since your cleric will not be able to resurrect dead party members until late in the game (Raise Dead scrolls are expensive too), you will not be able to continue the game with dead characters.  It's really a shame that the developer did not pace the game better, since it's going to turn off a lot of people from the very beginning.If you can get beyond the tedium and frustration of having to save the game every 2 minutes (and reload it almost as often), the gaming experience is still rather uninspired.  The story is lackluster and cliche.  There is none of the banter between party members that made Baldur's Gate so fun.  All of this together becomes mind-numbing after a while, since the game profoundly lacks a sense of purpose or narrative power.  It's all really unfortunate since some effort obviously went into creating the game.Ultimately, if you haven't played Baldur's Gate, by all means play it (both BG1 & BG2). If you've already tasted the glory of the Baldur's Gate series, then IWD will probably be a disappointment.Pros:+rich D&D; character creation+good voice acting and music+wide range of spells, items, etc.Cons:-unnecessarily tedious and difficult-lackluster story-Baldur's Gate clone without the personality", "I've always been a gamer, but I was never an AVID gamer until Icewind Dale came along. The game sucked me in and wouldn't spit me out until I had finished it. The game brilliantly allows you to create not just one hero, but a party of heroic companions from scratch. There aren't any generic Diablo characters here either - you don't just pick a pre-made warrior, sorcerer, or rogue and begin hacking away mindlessly at your foes. You get to fine tune so many aspects of your characters that just creating a party can take hours (and it's bloody good fun!). Despite the battle-oriented gameplay (which requires considerably more strategy and brainpower than anything in Diablo), this game is a pure RPG all the way. My only complaint (aside from the game actually ENDING eventually) is that the game design is somewhat linear. All the same, the game is masterful at hiding this fact, and indeed, this element keeps the story strong. Icewind Dale is a brilliant game. Period.", "I actually purchased Icewind Dale after I bought BG2 and in my opinion BG2 was not that much better.  Icewind Dale definetly has the best sound out of any game ever made.  The graphics are a little sketchy, but still beautiful to watch and admire.  The gameplay is a lot more linear than BG2, but I actually like the linear parts of BG2 more than the wide open areas, so that was definetly one of the aspects I loved about this game that some people hated.  Because this game is based on the 2nd addition AD&amp;D rules the gameplay is fast and gracefully complex.  Im sorry if I compared Icewind Dale to BG2 to much in this review, but there is just so many similarities between the two.  Overall Icewind Dale is an amazing game that supplies many hours of fast and furious RPG action.", "I was surprised by the quality of this game. I played this in December 2002, and it was much better than I though. Sure, the graphics engine is getting a little old, especially compared to games such as Dongeon Siege. However, I was still surprised that a game of this age looked so good.What isn't great however, is the lack of a manual. In fact, I wondered whether the contents of my box were incomplete, but apparently that is not the case. This severely limits the game. This simply isn't acceptible. If there was a manual, I would have rated this game at least one star higher than I did.That would make 4 stars, so why not 5? Well, there are some issues that keep the game from receiving a top rating (aside from the graphics). I do not like how the inventory is managed. It is very hard to see whether a weapon or armory is better than the one you currently have.Also, the path finding sometimes isn't great. All the members of your party go one way, while one of them gets lost. He/she will catch up ultimately, but it simply is annoying. Also, sometimes you try to get out the door but can't because the leading member of the party is blocked by other party members. The same happens when you try to talk to people.Addition: I now found the manual on the CD. This makes things a little better, but I still think it is a farce that a game like this doesn't ship with a printed manual.Unfortunately, the manual failed to explain some of the questions I had, and some of the oddities I couldn't figure out work just like I thought but are just a bit cumbersome. For instance, it is not a lot of fun to purchase a piece of armory for 5000 gold pieces just to figure out it is actually worse than the one you had before, forcing you to sell it again for 200 gold pieces. But I guess that's just how the old AD&D; rules were...", "Fails. I've never played baldurs gate. I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale. He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows. I stopped about half way through. The most ignorant part about the games is the battles. As you go they get increasingly frequent. I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second. As for fighting, the game lacks as it is more of a point and click.I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while.Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change.The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option &quot;max hp on level up&quot; set.Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive. Sorry but don't get it unless you wanna blow 5 bucks.", "Thankfully, I didn't waste much money on it.  My seller was alright and everything was there, including the cool cloth map.  However, I had problems.  For one thing, it took me the longest time to level up, even with all the sidequests.  For another, the enemies were too blasted difficult, the magics tended to backfire in the worst way.  I would face a wolf with a paladin, a druid, a cleric, and a bard.  You would think that the druid would be about as strong as a wolf, but no, my first druid got killed of by a couple of goblins.  Then I fired a burning hands at point blank range on these wolves and it killed my full-hp paladin, while barely scratching the wolf.  My paladin has 10 or 12 hp and the wolf had 13 hp on average, which led me to believe that at least my paladin would make it against this critter.  But three hours later, when I got to the cave, I had trouble beating orcs.  I had to have my whole party gang up to beat one and there was a cave full.  Then when my thief finally levels up, I never figured out how to increase hp or anything else for that matter.  Having a 2nd level bard with as much or not much more hp and no discernible increase in effectiveness (he seemed _less_  able to fight orcs now) was the final straw.  I had wasted enough time on this game. It would have been one thing if I was given enemies like that in later battles, but I had such enemies from the beginning.  Furthermore, I had my biggest problem with the fact that point and click with the mouse was the only option, half the time, I killed my own party.I would recommend a multiplayer game if it was more like Neverwinter Nights: hands on tutorial, cursor keys enabled (if I remember correctly), totally customizable controls. If I wanted to set the format to call animals, to arm, and to use certain spells it was easy to do. Level up increasing was easy as well."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.15060016512870789, 0.0036977746058255434, 0.1006842851638794, 0.15111689269542694, 0.2516205906867981, 0.33662793040275574, 0.0025532483123242855, 0.0030990506056696177]]}
