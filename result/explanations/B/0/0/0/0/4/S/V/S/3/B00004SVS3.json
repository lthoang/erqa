Some were even original.There's Heat Man, Bubble Man, Metal Man, Wood Man, Air Man, Crash Man, Flash Man and Quick Man.Difficulties are as follows:Heat Man - 6Bubble Man - 3Metal Man - 2.5Wood Man - 5Air Man - 7Crash Man -7.5Flash Man - 3Quick Man - 8.5Then you go to Wily's Castle, which is of medium difficulty and interesting to say the least.You get a chance to beat the pants off of some Dragon thing, that's annoying to say the least, but easy.You fight Dr. Wily twice, in a contraption he has concocted and out of it. He is mildly difficult the first time, and hardest the second time around.Graphics - 3.5/5Sound/Music - 4.25/5Controls - 6/5Game Play - 4/5Overall Difficulty - 3.5/5Overall Grade - 4.5/5", "\"While the first Mega Man adventure is a classic in every way, it was still a concept game and was very hard due to the lack of energy tanks and so forth.  Mega Man 2, however, proved to be the true beginning for the blue bomber.In this game you get energy tanks and the \"\"Item\"\" weapons, which were very similar to Rush.  I love how this game connected with the first one, and it's a shame that the games stopped connecting with each other after Mega Man 4.  The music and sounds are more fine-tuned here and this game is much easier.  I heartily recommend this one to the first-time player of the series.  The original is good but it's very hard (see my review for that one).  If you find it somewhere, GET IT.  You won't regret it.\"", "\"Younger Mega Man fans won't know just how popular and fun this game was back in the day, and how the years have gone by and the game is STILL a lot of fun.So many positive things can be said about Mega Man 2. The fantastic theme music, which is still the best music in a Mega Man game to date. Every single tune in this game is amazingly creative and memorable. If you don't think so you're crazy.Another thing that fascinates me is how people can never decide which of the first three Mega Man games is the best one. The first one I have never played, but they say it's extremely challenging, and because it only features 6 bosses, I don't think it's possible for me to prefer that one over Mega Man 2.Then we have Mega Man 3, which video game fans like to compete with Mega Man 2 to find out just which game delivers the ultimate Mega Man experience. Many people will try to say 3 is the best NES Mega Man game, while many others will say the clear winner is the 2nd one. Which one do I prefer? I have played 3, and while that one was also a fun, addicting action game, I think this one tops it. It doesn't smear it, it just beats it. The level design and the weapons Mega Man can equip just excite me more in this game. The creative juices were really flowing here.Mega Man 2, despite Capcom probably not completely sure if the Mega Man name will take off or not, marks where everything fell into place for the series and it feels SO MUCH like a classic because everything about this game feels so right. Mega Man 3 feels more like \"\"just another Mega Man game\"\" (though a great one- it just doesn't have that special feel, though of course many would disagree).Mega Man 4 is also a good game to own, and by the time Mega Man 5 was released it felt like players were thinking to themselves \"\"ok Capcom, that's enough!\"\". But really, all 5 of those NES Mega Man games are probably worth owning. I also have never played the 6th installment. People don't seem to like that one so you may want to avoid it. From the small amount of pictures I have seen of the game, it does look different from the previous 5. Though graphics aren't everything, so who knows if I'd like it or not.I really don't have any complaints with Mega Man 2. It's a lot of fun playing this game 15 years after I first rented and eventually bought. I can't remember where I bought it. Probably a yard sale. Back in the day you could buy NES games used at yard sales, garage sales and whatnot for extremely cheap prices. Just think, there was a point where I probably would have only had to pay a dollar for the first Mega Man game. Wow, it's definitely not like that today.I'm still angry that the video store in my town always had the Mega Man 1 cardboard box on the shelf, and when I took the box up to the man behind the counter so I could rent the game, I was always disappointed to find that the game was never available because someone never returned it, and to this day I never got to play it.Mega Man 2 offers a nice challenge, but unlike many NES games it's actually possible to beat this game with some practice. That's how a challenging game should be- hard at first, and the more you play the better you get. With practice you WILL beat this game, because there's really no place in any of the levels that can be called frustrating. Just a nice small challenge all the way through.This game has it all, folks. Great level design, fantastic music, weapons and bosses that make you want to keep coming back to it again and again. There's really nothing bad that can be said about it. It's Mega Man at his most Mega Man-y. As cheesy as that sounds, it's true!\"", "\"If it wasn't for the underground buzz that Mega Man received, Capcom would had most likely not released the 1989 sequel for the NES outside of Japan. If anything, it set itself up for Mega Man 2 to be a success. But not even Capcom expected how much of a success it would turn out to be: millions of copies were sold across the world and Mega Man would be quickly recognized as much as Nintendo's mascot, Mario. And when Mega Man 2 was released, the Blue Bomber returned in the breakout NES sequel that had gamers in a frenzy. I never bought it because I borrowed it from my best friend numerous times and it was worth it.Mega Man 2 had Mega Man return to save his world. Dr. Wily was really upset that he lost to Mega Man before and he vowed to get his revenge. To show he was better than Dr. Light and to crush Mega Man, Dr. Wily invented eight Robot Masters and challenged Mega Man to beat them and to fight him again. You picked one of eight stages to play through and beat the Robot Master to gain its special weapon. In addition to the special weapons, you were able to acquire three adapters that helped you cross gaps, climb walls or reach platforms out of reach. Once you beat all eight stages, you were whisked off to Dr. Wily's castle. There you had to play through six more stages, filled with more enemies, boss characters, the same eight Robot Masters from before and finally, Dr. Wily and his new robot contraptions. The game provided passwords so you could save your progress and come back later to finish your game.The PROS: Capcom responded to those gamers who felt the first game was too hard to beat by offering easy and hard modes. Because of that move, Mega Man 2 was accessible to every gamer and that helped it gain popularity. You had new Robot Masters, new weapons and more stages to play through. Everything here was better: the graphics, music, stage layouts, enemies and boss characters. The sound effects were mostly the same from the first game but were still good and so were the controls. The new weapon adapters were pretty cool and helped out in certain sections of the game. Since the game was longer, the password system was a nice addition so that you could play for a bit, copy the password and then use it later on to finish the game. Mega Man 2 was the first game to introduce \"\"energy tanks\"\": a health power up that filled up your energy bar when you needed it (the only catch was that you could carry up to four at a time.)The CONS: Mega Man 2 went down in the franchise's history as the easiest game in the series to beat. If you played it through the easy mode, it was an absolute but enjoyable walk in the park. But if you played it through the hard mode, the game gave you a mild challenge but nowhere near what you saw in Mega Man. Some players wanted more of a challenge besides those two modes but Capcom wanted everyone to enjoy the game so that's why it wasn't as hard as the first game. When you use the passwords, they saved your progress as far as how many robots you beat. If you used it during one of the stages in Dr. Wily's castle, the game always brought you back to the first stage of the castle. Also, the passwords never let you kept the energy tanks or extra lives you collected; you started without any energy tanks and three lives.Mega Man 2 was and still is regarded as one of the best in the NES series. To this date, it stirs the debate as to which NES Mega Man game reigns supreme and it's always been between Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3. No matter which game was your favorite, this one had a lot of fans and brought a lot of good memories to those gamers who were fortunate enough. If you're a Mega Man fan, you have this game in some form: the actual NES cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released for the PS2 and Gamecube consoles, or downloaded it to your Wii from the Virtual Console Service (500 points.) This was a game that anyone could have enjoyed and millions of gamers can attest to it.\"", "All the Megaman games are way to dawn hard, esspessially MM 6 thats insane.  I have played all these and the only one I enjoyed and played alot was Megaman 5 on origional gameboy the rest just pissed me off.", "Mega Man II was a truly needed installment of this 10 year great. Obviously, something must be right because everyone loved Mega Man. It played very simple but it was still like no other NES game at it's time.It added more challenge, longer boards with new enemies and new items and the bosses were NO push overs. Mega Man II had it all and it became a platform for the series and for other Action/Adventure type games.In many ways, a lot of games out there still show derivitives of the Mega Man series and for good reason. It's one of the longest running and most successful series that was on Nintendo and then SNES and now the PS (hopefully someday on the PS2).This is a definate for any of you retro collectors. seriously, no retro collection is complete without Mega Man II. No other game will challenge, make you think strategy and kick more butt than this. Get it or regret it!", "Like most fans, I love Mega Man 2. No ifs, ands or butts about it, Mega Man 2 single-handedly spearheaded my interest in the blue bomber and video games in general. But as simple of a joy as the game is even today, there's something my ever-evolving self has to ask, has Mega Man 2 been hurt by the hype?I ask this question because over the years I've seen other gamer's continuously put other landmark titles I grew up on unrealistically high pedestals. Final Fantasy VII may have been great, but does a sealed black-boarder copy of the game really warrant four hundred dollars? Xenogears may have had a psychotically layered narrative that turned it a playable anime, but was the game really perfect? Metal Gear Solid put you in the ever convincing shoes of a professional killer but can its aging gameplay match the cinematic quality of its story? It's rampant fandom that ignores such obvious questions that makes me wonder if such views are damaging.Damaging or not, even after replaying Mega Man 2 for the first time in the last few years, I can't even begin to tear this game down. Sure, it's rather lax in the difficulty department, but that's an area I've never been too concerned with when it comes to games in general. Even running through the game like I was on auto-pilot wasn't enough hurt it, which leads me to wonder how one could even take down Mega Man 2? A stake dipped in holy water? My guess is a good as any.Regardless of my ranting, Mega Man 2 is the hallmark everyone remembers it being. Despite my attempt to approach the game from safe vantage point to avoid the disappointment that sometimes comes with reminiscence, my worries evaporated quicker than a snow cone on a hot summer day. Relieved as I am that the game is more-or-less timeless, I'm still uncomfortable tooting the game's horn, something I'm not afraid to do for the also stellar Mega Man X4.", "Mega Man 2(1988). Part two in a series of nine games.The Mega Man series was created in 1987 as a result of an experiment where Capcom wanted to try adding the feature of stealing boss weapons in a platform game, instead of simply having the main character be always the same throughout the entire game. The first game actually fared decently when it was released, but it was no hit by any means. However, Capcom saw it to be successful enough to warrant a sequel, so they gathered all their best programmers and put together what could be considered the series's defining moment. Afterall, MM2 was responsible for Mega Man becoming a household name and spawning TONS of sequels over the years. It's my second favorite MM game(after 4 that is). Read on for the synopsis of this legendary title:PROS:-THERE ARE NOW 8 DIFFERENT BOSSES TO FIGHT. This is simply awesome because not only does the player get more options of what to do, but also THE BOSSES IN THIS GAME ARE SOME OF THE COOLEST MM BOSSES EVER CONCEIVED. Quickman, Crashman, and Metalman are personal favorites of mine. Plus, at least half of the game's bosses present a reasonable challenge.-THE ADDITION OF THE ITEM ADAPTORS. There are three different items to be acquired throughout the game, each having its own unique transportation usefulness. For instance, Item #3 is good for climing walls with, while Item #2 is useful for flying across large pits. These are all much better than the previous game's Magnet Beam Generator.-Now and forever on, YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WITH PASSWORDS. IMHO, I find that passwords in a MM game are pointless because the games don't take very long to play through. However, if you do lack patience and can't sit still for an hour or two, using passwords will help you.-THE LEVELS ARE ALL VARIED AND FUN TO GO THROUGH. Example: Crashman's level is mostly vertical climbing, while Bubbleman's stage forces you to wade through water avoiding spikes, and Quickman's level involves racing to the bottom avoiding the advancing beams. No stage before the Wily levels ever gets repetitive in this game.-THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY GENIOUS. All the tunes, with the exception of one, are catchy and fit the Mega Man games PERFECTLY. Several tunes really stand out, such as Airman, Bubbleman, Flashman, the boss theme, and the first Wily Stage. Of all the MM games, MM2 arguably has the most consistently good soundtrack.-INTRODUCTION OF THE E-TANKS. These are a must in MM games. When you grab one, you can fill up your health to the max, but the greatest benefit is that you can save 4 tanks up for when you really need them, such as boss battles. Even with the E-tanks, the game's challenge factor doesn't suffer one bit.-TWO LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY: EASY AND NORMAL. For the most part, playing the game on normal is the best option because it keeps the game hard enough to offer enough challenge for seasoned MM veterans. However, if you're new to the series, playing it on easy mode is a great way to get equainted with the controls.CONS:-Beating the game on easy mode gives you exactly the same result as playing it on normal, so the replay value is diminished slightly.-One thing that isn't a real big deal but has always bothered me is the realistic sense of Woodman's weapon. A leaf shield? Come on. I must congradulate Dr. Light on a job well done for creating a super metal blue robot that can be destroyed by fluttering leaves.-Although most all of the music in this game is very good, the tune in the 2nd half of Wily's castle gets repetitive, and grating.-Believe it or not, MM2 ACTUALLY HAS THE WEAKEST STORY OF ALL OF THE MM GAMES; NES, SNES, and PSX MM games included. Here's all the plot really is: Dr. Wily is back for revenge with 8 more robots to take over the world. That's it. How unoriginal and contrived is that? Good thing this &quot;story&quot; happened to be in an early MM game as opposed to one of its numerous sequels.Despite a few slight shortcomings, this is THE mandatory MM game to have on the NES, and should be the first game for those of you getting into the series. 5 stars overall. Even though the MM series couldn't exist without the first game, it certainly wouldn't have taken off and become a huge franchise if not for MM2. If you have a softspot for good oldschool gaming, then you've come to the right place. This game coined my favorite dialog phrase used in a MM game. I've used it in other reviews, but I'll say it again: GET EQUIPPED WITH BUBBLE LEAD. If you see this game, do not under any circumstance hesitate to pick it up.", "This game is a definite step above the first game, but one could say that MM1 was more of a prototype. MM1 is missing many of the features that was introduced in Megaman 2 - namely the power to gain different weapons from the vanquished Robot Masters along with the assistance of the robotic dog Rush.The points/score system has been eliminated, which is good since it didn't really serve a function in MM1. This game would actually set the tone for the rest of the series - cans of Energy, the help of Rush, and the fact that the number of Robot Masters were upped to 8 as opposed to the original 6. The graphics are also a step ahead, since MM1 had fairly simpler graphics - but then, comparing MM1 to the rest of the series is like comparing the first Legend of Zelda or the first Super Mario Brothers game to the rest of their respective series. Megaman 2 is a solid title and set a good note for the rest of the series, and a definite must-play for any Megaman fan.", "huge fan of megaman ever since i was a little kid and its great to finally be able to add this to my collection. great game arrived mind condition with the label and everything. A+", "MegaMan was a good NES game, but people seem to overlook it. The sequel, on the other hand, grew BIG.The MegaMan series is known for its amazing graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics, precise controls, and frustrating difficulty. MegaMan 2 has all that.You choose from 8 different robot masters, selecting your own order of levels.The level designs are as creative as ever. However, they are also very hard. Luckily, killing certain enemies might give you an orb to restore your health. Or better yet, if you're lucky enough, a 1up! Unfortunately, that won't save you from having to go through Heat Man's puzzling disappearing blocks.Dr. Wily's stage is a total pain in the neck, too. Deathtraps are set here and there.But still, MegaMan 2 is one the best and most frustrating NES games ever. If you are a fan or looking for a challenge, then you should buy this.", "\"I remember years ago when I was just a kid. My dad took me to the store to purchase a new NES game for my July birthday. (I got the NES for Christmas and had only rented games.) The clerk at the store sold us on Mega Man 2. He said it was really popular and was just released. So with that my video game obsession began.Mega Man is a classic platform, side scroller that does have some sandbox elements to it. It allows you to choose which levels and bosses to go after first. Once you defeat them, you gain their weapons. This is vital, as some bosses and levels are nearly impossible without the right weapon combinations. It does allow you to \"\"save\"\" your progress with a bingo style code system that allows you opt out of defeating levels you already completed. IMO this is the BEST Mega Man title, and it still plays very well. Now my 5 year old son and I play it together.\"", "\"I literally hit myself over the head in thinking \"\"why i did'nt get this game when I was younger\"\" because finally playing it is super fun!  I heard many good things about Mega Man 2 on Nintendo Power magazines and a few of my peers, but I just did'nt take the time to play it.  Unlike many 70's and 80's babies, I did'nt own a huge library of Nintendo titles because they were very expensive and my dad encouraged us to rent them before we decide if we want to own them, but I should have given this a shot back in the day.  Mega Man 2 was rented out most of the time, but I should've snagged it that one moment it was staring at my face.  I finally bought a used copy off Amazon that still plays great.Mega Man must face Dr Wily, again so he must go through 8 of his new creations and absorb each and every one of their powers to use against robots that varies in weaknesses.  The most useful weapons to use are the Metal weapon and the Quick weapon of which may be used on almost all occasions without quickly depleting your power bar.  I haven't yet completed the game, of which I intend to do, but it is a hard game and requires quick strategy, serious thinking, and moderate memorization to get through the first few of Dr. Wily's stages.  Just because a game is hard does'nt always mean that its bad.  It is one of the top 10 NES games and the gameplay/graphics/greatness more than proves it.  It was well advanced for 1988 and it still a great game to play in 2008, so its better being 20 years late than never having to play it at all.  I will plan to get Mega Man 1 and 3 in the future, but I will ignore the last 3 in the NES series.  The reason why I did'nt get the PS2 Anniversary collection is because I heard that the last 3 Mega Man games were not that great and I did'nt want to risk it with my money.  Another reason is that I like the joy of building up my NES library with good games that I did'nt get to do in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  Many popular used, but decent quality NES games are dirt cheap and are worth the investment and the thrill if you still have your NES today.\"", "Mega Man II is perhaps the best of the original series on the NES.  It may not have a fantastic plot, but those of us who remember the NES days weren't too concerned with plot anyway (remember, you were Mario going to rescue the Princess from the clutches of King Koopa).  Mega Man II introduced a few things to the series that the first one lacked.  The biggest new assest was perhaps the Energy Tank.  While you could only carry four, it was nice that for once I didn't have to go back and forth killing enemies for energy pellets.The gameplay was a step up for this.  Mega Man II also has more balanced difficulty.  It isn't just the energy tanks, it's that you're more likely to survive in cases where you can't.  There are eight robot masters as opposed to six, and the weapons are a little better.  The element of Robot Masters being weak to other Robot Master weapons is still there, and it works out even better here than it did in the first one.  It's a bit more unpredictable.The difficulty may be balanced, but it isn't by any means the hardest of the Mega Man series (the first one is).  It's actually one of the easier ones in the series.  The bulk of the difficulty may come from Quick Man's stage, and even that can be taken care of quite easily.  Taking on the robot masters a second time is also pretty easy when you've got all their weapons to use against them, and they always drop an energy pellet that restores probably more damage than they'll do to you.  In other words, the game is not a challenge.  There are still moments where it's difficult, but for the most part, unlike the first game, it seems more managable than the first game.The music is also a lot better, and so are the graphics.  There are fewer graphical glitches, and the music gets stuck in your head for a long time.  Mega Man II is a huge step above the original Mega Man in all respects.  It plays better, it's not nearly as difficult (even on the difficult setting) and has fantastic music to boot.  This is the Mega Man game that serves as the staple for the series.", "As the title describes this is one of the best NES games ever.  This particular title include colorful graphics, simple controls, and incredible music.  Plus a hell of a plot.As the title implies you are Mega Man, a cyborg built to stop Dr. Wiley and his evil plans.  You ahve to face 8 robot bosses in no particular order (although it can help if you know the weakness)and then go off and face Wiley in his Castle.This game doesn't lack much, the dificulty is a little much and the level designs are amazing (for the time and system).However the thing that seperates this title is the music, the music is one of the best ever, on all game systems.  It fits perfectly.Buy this game.", "One of the best games EVER.... nuff said....Mega Man RULZ!If you don't have the compilation, GET IT!!", "This was the Mega Man game that brought passwords, eight robot leaders, energy tanks, specialty items, and several other now common aspects into the series. The play control is simple, but excellent. Graphics are nothing by today's standards, but back then were top of the line. And besides there's more to a game than that. Being able to tackle the stages in an order of your choosing is a convenience, but also forces you to take strategy into account. The game difficulty isn't terrible (though Dr. Wily's fortress is a pain the first few times), meaning most gamers shouldn't have much trouble beating it. If you have an NES this is a game you should not be without."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.015425270423293114, 0.05218784138560295, 0.03404935821890831, 0.040056418627500534, 0.06479006260633469, 0.0754670724272728, 0.06479733437299728, 0.14966687560081482, 0.027396807447075844, 0.08648990094661713, 0.04867752641439438, 0.01240099873393774, 0.07142918556928635, 0.02083607204258442, 0.09096746146678925, 0.12431364506483078, 0.021048158407211304]]}
