(lol yeah I was geek.)I think the greatest feature of the game was story which was always interesting. I will warn you though that the story is really heavy and questions our very existence.", "\"On November 2, 2003, I wrote a review of Xenogears and it went like this:\"\"Out of all the RPG fansites and magazines and such, you'll find many RPG fans adoring this particular game. Xenogears is a decent game and it's a shame that it wasn't released under a Greatest Hits collection like the horrible Chrono Cross has. Still, I find myself finding this game to be far from great. Being somewhat of an RPG fan (I use \"\"somewhat\"\" very loosely), I find myself disappointed but also intrigued. Read on or face the fires of Hell:THE GOODThis game has a REALLY good storyline, and we get a main character that's unique in the sense that he doesn't want to fight, but he knows that he must. The storyline has often been touted as the best plot an RPG ever had, and while that can be debated (I always thought Chrono Trigger had the best storyline...), it's still awesome. A futuristic tale of social class warfare with various different symbolisms... very complex. I was a bit disturbed at the game's athiest point of view, but oh well. I'll let that slide. The battle system is also quite good, featuring several different combos your characters and gears can perform. The music is top notch, and since it's the same composer of Chrono Trigger (Yasunori Mitsuda), you can expect a gold musical score here. The multiplayer feature is quite good, too, and I shun all those people who have beaten me by using Xenogears (the ultim---er, CHEATING gear *Cough Cough* Someone I know.... *Cough Cough*).THE BADThe unfortunate downside of this game happens to be in the presentation. This game is virtually 70% dialogue and story and 30% gameplay. I'm not kidding. I came here to play a GAME, not WATCH it! I guess the RPG fans just want to sit there in awe, but when a battle is going on, I EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. I was vastly disappointed when it cut to one of the characters in a chair talking about the battle with the pendant in the background swaying back and forth. This happened a lot on the second disc and it's a shame. I also felt the love story, albeit far from bad, didn't quite get the boost that it needed; it just seemed to \"\"happen.\"\" Oh well.OVERALLDie hard RPG fans no doubt love this game and while it's far from terrible, I do think it's overrated. A great story with interesting characters, but not nearly enough gameplay involvement. If I wanted to watch something, I'll watch a DVD. Nevertheless, I do recommend this game to any RPG fan, BUT ONLY TO THOSE WITH A LOT OF PATIENCE. I might get negatives for this, but that's just because the people that give negative votes are usually very shallow.\"\"Seven years later, I decided to return to Xenogears.  I don't play video games that often these days, but this was a game that haunted me.  I gave it an average---nearly sub-average---review and as you can tell from my earlier review here, I already had bias going into it.  I felt it was overrated and was really let down by the second disc, in particular.  Also, being a Christian at the time, I didn't like its atheistic storyline and despite \"\"letting it slide,\"\" I think it seeped its way into the review, nonetheless.So, as a bit of an addendum, I am changing my review.  Also, some of you complained that my reviews have spoilers.  Well, this is an RPG that I'm reviewing, so therefore, consider yourself warned.THE STORY10,000 years before the game's story takes place, a ship called the Eldridge was flying through space.  The humans onboard had dismantled \"\"Deus,\"\" a powerful biomechanical invasion computer that was deemed too powerful.  Deus had become self-aware, a la The Terminator's SkyNet, and started to take over the ship.  It crash-lands with only a handful of survivors; one of them was Abel, a boy who came into contact with the Wave Existence (some sort of supernatural god-like junction...it's a bit confusing there.), and thus, many descendants and reincarnated versions of him appear at several different points of the game (in order to relentlessly stop Deus).  For all intents and purposes of this review, the last incarnation is the game's main character, Fei Fong Wong.What starts off as a Gundam-like game shifts into a very deep, very philosophical storyline.  We have awesome characters like the \"\"Doc\"\" Citan; We have Bart, the prince and heir to the throne of Aveh; There's Rico, a physically strong prisoner originally in Nortune; Also, there's Billy Black (my favorite character, actually), a former priest who specializes in guns; and Elly, a former Gebler soldier who crosses paths with Fei not only within the current time frame of the game, but as different incarnations in the past as well (and his love interest in all incarnations).  There are villains in the game, two of them having a connection with Fei; the only two I'll spoil are Krelian (who was a friend of one of Fei's past incarnations) and, of course, Deus.What is so controversial about this story is that it takes on an atheist (or humanist) approach.  Deus is worshiped as a \"\"god\"\" by the humans throughout the centuries and it is only revealed much later that it had malevolent intentions.  Square has a lot of cajones for getting this game released; Fei essentially has to kill god!  The scene that really stuck out to me was near the end of the game...Fei chases after the departing/ defeated Deus to rescue Elly and confronts Krelian, who---by this point---becomes a part of Deus.  Krelian kept whining about how he thought mankind needed to return to the \"\"beginning,\"\" when human frailties didn't exist and all there was, was God.  Fei followed that with talking about the inherently good qualities of mankind, and that \"\"we don't need a god\"\" to understand and embrace concepts like love.  This sensitive subject almost caused the game to not be released here, and probably turned away a lot of potential gamers because of its stance.  I turned away for a while partially because of that reason, but I'm glad I returned.The character Fei is also not your typical hero.  I will not spoil his backstory, but you will learn that he's a very Freudian type of hero and not your typical righteous youngin' like Cecil or Crono.  I also liked Citan, whose real intentions were very \"\"behind the scenes\"\" most of the game, and I identified with Billy's upbringing in the priest hood and then learning that it was all a cover up.  Bart is your typical smartass, whip-wielding hero, who despite his rambunctious nature wants to bring a democracy to the kingdom of Aveh.  There are other characters to flesh out, but I will leave it to you---the gamer---to explore the rest on your own.GAMEPLAYThere are two different kinds of battles (well, three, if you count the one-on-one arena battles).  One is with your regular people (up to only three this game) and you can perform combos.  The second is your gear battles.  When you're fighting in gears, it's a bit more complicated.  You use fuel, so you have to learn to play smart and conserve sometimes; later in the game, you can find different accessories that allow you to \"\"Charge\"\" up to 500 fuel at a time, so it gets easier then.  You also perform combos, but the combos can lead to higher attack levels and even into Infinity Mode.  It's actually not as complicated as it may sound, but if you're expecting a button mashing RPG, you've come to the wrong place.ANIME CUT SCENESThere are several anime cut scenes located throughout the game, especially on the second disc.  They are nice, although for someone like me that just wants a good story and awesome gameplay, they're not all that necessary.  More on that later.MUSICThe music is composed by none other than Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda.  The soundtrack is AMAZING.  It was the one thing that kept me going through some of the game's rough spots, and I especially liked the vocal tracks (\"\"Stars of Tears\"\" did not make it into the game except as the instrumental \"\"Emotions\"\" world map theme, but the ending theme is still there.).  His themes for Grahf, Thames, and the love relationship between Fei and Elly (\"\"The Treasure Which Cannot Be Stolen\"\" and \"\"Shattering Egg of Dreams,\"\" among others.) were very well composed.  Some tracks remind me of Chrono Trigger, like Bart's theme (\"\"Bonds of Sea and Fire\"\") and \"\"Leftovers of the Dreams of the Strong,\"\" which sounds ironically similar to the theme of Guardia in Chrono Trigger.  \"\"The One Who is Torn Apart\"\" (played most during the \"\"Id\"\" encounters and Fei's revelatory scenes) reminds me of Zeal Palace and Magus' Castle from Chrono Trigger, respectively (ambiance and everything!).  My favorite track is probably \"\"Flight,\"\" which plays during some momentous fight scenes (one of them with a giant Chu-Chu...erm, k...).  The score as a whole is well-rounded and while the game could've used a couple more tracks to break up some of the monotony of the second disc, I have no complaints.  Yasunori Mitsuda is the man.NOW, ONTO SOME OF THE NEGATIVES...Despite my newfound love for the game, it does have its drawbacks.  Like many reviewers have already said, it has a LOT of dialogue.  For one thing---going back to the anime cut scenes---they didn't sync up the English voice acting with the scenes at all, which may throw a lot of you off; I didn't find it to be a huge hindrance, but it was a minor distraction.  Another thing with the dialogue was that once you reach the second disc, the first freaking half of it is basically a couple battles and a lot of \"\"chair\"\" scenes in which a particular character---for instance, Fei, Elly, or Citan---will sit in it with Fei's pendant in the background swinging, all the while said character explains what's going on.  There's a particular point when you discover Solaris using dead people as medicine and food, even going so far as to reference the \"\"Soylent Green\"\" movie, and reading about the further explanation of that was pointless.  During this time, also, is when you discover Deus is the reason some of the population starts mutating into zombies (to recollect them as part of its bio-mechanical being...yeah.), and that part I found particularly annoying (I also found it odd that Fei talks about killing the zombies off to save their souls, but when a ginormous zombie monster bursts out of nowhere to eat them, Fei's like \"\"OH NO!  We have to save them from the MONSTER!\"\"  Weren't you just discussing putting them out of their misery?  Am I just a cold-hearted you-know-what from playing too much Resident Evil?).  BUT, fair reader, ONCE you get to the point on Disc 2 where Fei's personality is explored, THEN it gets awesome again.  So, do be patient!One other complaint before moving on is that some of the characters are pretty much useless towards the end; I'm not going to say who, because maybe someone reading this will find (or have found) different strategies with which to beat the final hour of the game, but there were a couple that I started using at the start of their entry into the storyline, but quickly found that the later battles did not suit their fighting styles.  I would like feedback on this particular part of the game.OVERALLSo...after my rediscovery, do I highly recommend this game?  Well, it is still a difficult game to rate.  The pacing is a bit sluggish, which is the main drawback of this game.  It throws a lot at you at once in terms of story, and believe me, the spoilers I gave you aren't even half of the game.  I don't know if Square lost money during production, or they just ran out of time and couldn't smooth it over, but either way, the pacing will frustrate you for a time.  Also, I could've done without the anime cut scenes, despite how beautifully they're done...and like I said before, the minimal voice acting present is off-sync with the anime cut-scenes and switches to Japanese during the fighting parts, which can be a bit distracting at first.That being said, the game is infinitely better than I have painted it out to be before; the music's awesome AND diverse, the gameplay's addicting (when it's not sluggish), and the storyline is not only immersive, but very deep on both an emotional level and a philosophical one; its challenging of religious authority and support of the human condition deserves some commendation.  I also liked the love story, which plays out well despite some unnecessary angst right when Disc 2 begins.  The characters, for the most part, are very memorable; any time you actually make me CARE for the characters is a good thing!  If you can get past its flaws, the game will sweep you into its narrative.So, to put it simply, if you are a novice RPG goer, you might be turned off by it initially.  But if you've played a few RPGs, especially some classics like Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Trigger, then by all means, get a copy of this game and enjoy it!If you're a gamer like me that was turned off by initial impression, I hope you've at least given the game a second chance.  It's a must-have for any fan of RPGs, and I hereby take back my statement that it was \"\"a mixed bag.\"\"  I'm glad to finally see why Xenogears gets the status it so richly deserves.My recommendations before/alongside this one are:Super Mario RPGChrono TriggerFinal Fantasy IV (II on SNES)Final Fantasy VI (III on SNES) or VII\"", "This game is amazingly good and well worth the money if you have a system capable of playing it.  The combat system is really neat (you create combos in a turn based battle system), the gears have a fun, albeit very simple, equipment system, the anime cutscenes are cool and if you're an old school rpg nerd there are some fun cameos (Lucca from chrono trigger for one).", "\"Truthfully, I really want to be able to recommend this game.  It's not as though there's not a lot here to recommend--the story is well written, and though it doesn't stray TOO far from the well-beaten RPG path, it does break some new ground.  The battle system, while not revolutionary, is at least workable.  More than anything, I got around forty hours of solid enjoyment out of this title.The only problem is that it took me sixty hours to finish the game, and it's those other twenty that get in the way of my giving an unconditional recommendation.  There are a lot of ways to screw up a game.  You can poorly design the levels, you can write a broken combat progression, you can blow the ending--the list is pretty well endless.  One way that I never thought I'd witness, however, is simply not finishing the thing.  This game is not done.  There is no other way to put it.All the way up through the end of the first CD, things cruised along nicely.  Then, all of a sudden, the world map disappeared.  That's the only way I can think to put it.  Whereas before I had been able to control where my characters went and explore the environments, now I was forced to sit through rather uninteresting sequences featuring one of the lead characters sitting in a wicker chair and telling me what I supposedly just did.  The ONLY interaction between the game and the player through that second CD consists of fighting the boss battles that it unceremoniously thrusts you into.That is a terrible, criminal sin of game design.  You are allowed to put the plot on a rail if you want, but you DO NOT get to take away any ability the player may have had to control the game or interact with the world.  At that point, your \"\"game\"\" ceases to be a game and becomes an experiment in button pushing.  I don't mind exposition, but I do expect to have some control over my own fate when the speech gets done.  If you take that away from me, I get angry, and this game made me VERY angry.There are other problems here as well.  By Square standards, the localization is dismal.  While it's not as incomprehensible as, say, Okage, there are still some pretty serious mistakes in the English script.  Is it just me, or is it reasonable to expect that the people localizing my game for me know that the word is \"\"should've\"\"--not \"\"should of.\"\"  Mistakes like that are strewn throughout the game text, and I must admit that it detracted a little bit from my ability to enjoy the experience.  Of course, as the game progressed, those errors got worse.  Around halfway through the second CD, the script writers were dropping words by the twos and threes.  Now, that didn't throw me SO much, since I normally read like that anyway, but for people who, you know, like to have all the words, this could be a problem, particularly coming from Square--a house made famous in part by its great localization efforts.The plot is a little bit more adult than you're likely to find with other games in the genre.  Indeed--any parents out there who might be concerned with their children reading thinly veiled discussions of pedophile priests and cartoon buttocks would be well advised to avoid this title.  It's really pretty standard anime/manga fare on the whole, but, strangely enough, you don't see much of that in the video game industry, so the game manages to be unique and interesting.  Of course, the religious references could use some work.  I know from Dogma that Metatron is the recording angel (and that's pretty obscure), but I find it difficult to believe that somebody who hasn't been through seminary is going to be able to appreciate all of the parallels that this plot has with the Christian faith.On the whole, this game is ALMOST incredible.  Had it stayed in production for another year, it might have made it all the way there.  Unfortunately, the product that we're left with is unfinished, with some incredibly serious problems near the end (for example, what is the point of letting me run around all over the world map and collect all these great pieces of character gear if the last dungeon is a GEAR dungeon?).  As it stands, RPG faithful and anybody willing to overlook the game's faults should find an interesting experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's not a member of one of those niche groups.  We can only hope that Xenosaga (NOT a prequel, as most would have you believe), due out early next year in the U.S., avoids the mistakes that hold this title back.\"", "\"This is a very long video game.  For me, it took about 90 hours to finish.  But let me emphasize that those 90 hours were some of the most engrossing that I have ever experienced with a video game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who does not mind the somewhat below-average graphics.  The game's soundtrack more than compensates for any graphical shortcomings.The battles are random, and perhaps too numerous in quantity for this gamer's preference.  However, most can be quite entertaining.  Some battles are fought while the characters are controlling giant machines called \"\"Gears\"\".  Most battles are fought in hand-to-hand combat, with each character having the option to unleash powerful attack combinations.If there is a shortcoming to this game, it has to be the fact that the story was too complicated and too deep to communicate in the manner that they chose.  By the second disk, some of the main characters had to basically sit in a chair and narrate the story to get it moving in the right direction.  Perhaps the older Playstation console just did not have the power for the inclusion of cutscenes.\"", "\"Xenogears is one of those premier titles that for some reason you can't attack. Unlike Final Fantasy VII which has just as much naysayers as it as fanatics, Xenogears is one of those kind of games where any attempt to label it less than a masterpiece is met with \"\"you just didn't get it\"\" or \"\"you don't know good videogames then\"\". So allow me to be one of the few that will say the game is in the \"\"gray area\"\": it's a good, even great game but it's just shy from the awesomeness everyone says it is.Story: Fei lives in Lahan, a quiet pastoral-like village. One night, massive robots called Gears(similar to Evangelion's EVA's) land and Fei jumps in an unoccupied Gear to fight them off. Something is awakened however inside him and he unleashes, which doesn't bode well for his village. Shunned by the villagers, he leaves and finds himself in a massive plot with serious religious overtones.Graphics: It's the Playstation so it does look a bit outdated. However the graphics at times are nice to look at during the cities/locations. The overworld looks awful while battles look pretty decent, especially the Gear battles. The only problem is the camera sometimes. It's 3D so you can rotate the camera but sometimes the camera won't go higher or lower so sometimes it's pretty much guesswork how high something is.Sound/Music: Funny how both opposites these are. First off, the VA during the anime cutscenes are fine but the lip-sync is even worse than old kung fu movie dubs. The music however is excellent and you should definately track down the soundtrack.Gameplay: The battle system is slightly different than that \"\"tap X\"\" stuff but not by much. You get 3 moves, Weak, Mid and Strong. Weak takes 1 AP, Mid 2 and Strong takes 3. You have a certain limit of AP that you can use. However, you can decide to \"\"save\"\" it and add it to a meter. Save up enough and you can unleash one Deathblow move after another. The only problem is that I couldn't find any indication on what your Deathblow moves were. It's pretty much trial and error trying to figure out what the combos are, or simply research on the internet. I went through a good 5 hours before I realized how to get a Deathblow cause there was no way of knowing what they were, let alone how to get one.The Gear battles are somewhat the same, except each move costs Fuel and you have a preset limit. You can Charge to replenish your Fuel or you can Booster which costs Fuel but your attacking is better. Your Deathblows as a human are important because they carry over to your Gears as well. And they're quite important too. One early battle in my gear I was doing all my best attacks against one boss and I didn't know how to heal Gears yet so he completely beat me before he even got close to dying. Learning deathblows, I quickly beat him afterwards.How's the story? Well it's well-written sure with a lot of religious references and elements. However, the game's so serious that the characters in a way feel like ways to advance the plot without being fleshed out. Also what I call the teaser happens too often. That's the \"\"wait, this happened, could it be he's...?\"\" parts and you find out 2 hours later what that is. Questions upon questions get piled up leaving you quite confused until later.It's certainly a recommendable game, it's just not one of those \"\"best RPG ever\"\" ones, it's merely one of their better ones.\"", "From what people make this game out to be, it was supposed to be the &quot;best game of all time&quot; perhaps, but I saw it completely different. I dunno if it is just me, but I found this games storyline incredibly boring, the battle system was OK in some areas, and the music was absolutely dreadful. Let me break it down for you....Music: 1/5...Why? Because it repeats the same tunes over...and over...and OVER AGAIN. The reason I gave it one star, is because when you first hear the music it sounds good, but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game, its tedious and very annoying. And when it comes down to it I wasn't very satisfied with the music to begin with. Like for example, most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music, so it gets very repetitive.Storyline: 2/5I found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating. Not once in the game did I really care about the characters or what was really going on. And there is so much talking in this game I could probably fall asleep after drinking 10 glasses of cafe mocha...To be blunt...there is way too much talking...and the story isnt explained till the end. So throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going on.Entertainment- 3/5Why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment? Well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interesting.Playability- 4/5This is probably the only good part about this game. You can actually jump around here (unlike most RPGs) and there is plenty to explore in your environment. This sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeons...not so dull.Graphics- 3.5/5The graphics are alright, not good enough to give four stars, but pretty good for when it came out. I am a sucker for 3d playstation one style graphics...kinda the old-school style that playstation RPGs used to have. If you are looking for final fantasy 8 graphics....you wont find them here.Overall- 2.5/5If you have a lot of time on your hands...or like playing games for extended periods of time...this is for you.I however, do not enjoy playing games for 80 hours just to see the ending. Yes thats right...80 + hours just to finish it off, not including finishing everything such as side quests...just the storyline. How someone can sit through 80 hours of jabbering and a boring storyline...and let's not forget annoying music...I have no idea. I hope some day I will understand why this game is considered to be so great...but I don't think it will happen.Do i recommend this? Nope.", "\"Xenogears is another one of Square's epic masterpieces to come out of their golden age (around the time they were making Final Fantasy VII through Final Fantasy X).  Sadly, Square seems to have jumped the shark after merging with Enix.  After making so many masterpieces they start pumping out the absolutely dreadful Final Fantasy X-2 and the lackluster Final Fantasy XII.  I really don't know what happened to them...  Anyway, back on topic.  This game is awesome.  Let's find out why!Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics could be better.  These are not the best I've seen on the PS1.  I can't quite remember whether or not these were outstanding for their time, but they certaintly aren't on the highest level of what the PS1 can achieve.  The cutscenes are done in a 2-D anime style, which just feels timeless and classic.  Thus, I'll give the graphics an overall average score of \"\"7\"\".Music (score 9/10): The music is very good.  Everything feels like it belongs and nothing particularly grates on your ears.  The battle music is upbeat and enjoyable.  Some of the music is quite memorable.  In fact, it's good enough you might buy the soundtrack.  So, no complaints at all.Characters (score 10/10): This is what characterization is all about!  The main characters are all extremely well developed and interesting.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and backstory.  This is what makes an RPG good (aside from the story, of course).  Fei (your main character) is particularly well-developed.  He seems to be suffering from a fictionalized form of Dissociative Identity Disorder.  I love it when my video game characters are mentally ill!  Even characters that you might think are just comic relief later prove themselves to be multifaceted and complex.  This section gets a perfect score from me.Story (score 10/10): Is there even a word for how awesome the story is?!  Among of sea of standard \"\"save the world from generic evil bad guys\"\" plots this game really stands out as unique.  I mean, the storyline deals with some surprisingly mature topics for an RPG (including themes of religion, the nature of memory, prejudice, reincarnation and even cannibalism).  The story might be even better than the much touted storyline of Final Fantasy VII (and I love that game immensely, so I'm really giving Xenogears high praise).Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based, but unique compared to the more traditional turn-based games like Final Fantasy or Grandia.  Basically you have AP which are points that you can use to perform strong, moderate or weak hits (these are mapped to various buttons, like the triangle button and the O button).  You use up your AP for the turn and then perform a string of attacks.  Certain combinations are Deathblows which are much stronger attacks.  There's also more traditional magic attacks to choose from and such.  This system, although similar to more traditional RPGs, feels somehow fresh and different.  It's a bit more complex than just choosing the \"\"attack\"\" option.  The only downside is that it can feel a bit tedious having to input all those commands sometimes.Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The menus are fine.  This game was a bit unusual at the time because it features a rotating camera.  In other words, the camera isn't fixed - you can rotate a full 360 degrees.  For the most part this works fine and navigation isn't too confusing.  I must complain a bit about dungeon design, which can be a bit confusing.  A whole lot of the dungeons are rather maze-like and easy to get lost in.  Whether or not this bothers you will probably depend on your sensibilities as a gamer, but I found just a little nerve-wracking (and I opted to use a guide - don't shoot me!).  Anywho, the only other issue I can think of has to do with a bit of a glitch.  My copy of the game would tend to freeze up in this one area over and over again.  I eventually got past it and never had that problem again on subsequent playthroughs.  I don't know if it was just my copy of the game or if the game's programming may be prone to glitchiness or what, but I just thought I'd warn you.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this game has certainly earned its place among the \"\"classic\"\" RPGs.  If you are a serious RPG fan and somehow haven't played this game yet, I strongly suggest you pick it up.  It's rather expensive right now, unfortunately, but it's well worth having in your collection.  Go get it!\"", "\"It's a shame to know that such a wonderful concept of a game had to go through budget cuts due to other Final Fantasy games coming out.  Xenogears is a pure RPG classic.  However, I only recommend this to those who are in love with the RPG genre and also whom don't mind to read for long periods of time.  This brought a great gaming experience, but some times frustrating.  Often the mazes the characters were forced to find their way through brought on a lot of aggravation when there were a lot of random encounters.  By the time the battle was through one could almost have forgotten where they came from.The Pros: Excellent story with strong, believable characters.Beautifully done animated cutscenes with voice-oversFun battle system with learned combos and magic.Quite a lengthy game, (took me 63 hours to complete)A gorgeous musical score, (get the soundtrack too!)The Cons: Often times frustrating areas to explore.Graphics can be quite pixilatedThe battle sounds are quite repetitiveOverall, Xenogears is one of those hidden, \"\"treasures\"\" in my oppinion. However, if you are not an avid RPG player, young into the genre, and lack patience for lots of reading, Xenogears may not be the game for you.  Though the game is hard to find, (which may change, since it may soon become a Greatest Hit) Although if you can't wait, and believe your game collection is not complete with out it, (which is what I believe), run and get it now, it is worth a great cost. If the gameplay doesn't capture you, then at least the heartwarming, yet complex story will...and vice versa.  There's enough to love about this game!\"", "And it's true too. This IS one of the best, if not THE best, rpg/rpgs ever created.Luckily for me, I bought this game right when it hit the shelfs ;) . I think the only way you can get one is by buying it from someone or getting it off an auction.Anyway, the story is amazing. It's preety confusing at first, but if you REALLY pay attention you should understand it. But this game is for people 13+ years old, because younger kids would never get this story.  But like i said, it is amazing and it is written perfectley.The gameplay is very fun. The battles, unlike the final fantasy series, are very fun to play. You get to use combos, magic, etc. etc. etc.  You press triangle for weak attack, square for medium attack, and x for strong attack. Its great. Most rpgs just have an attack command an stuff.The graphics is where this game lacks. They aren't bad, but it just isn't good either. The people look very blurry when the camera gets really close, but 90% of the time the camera is in its normal angle.Buy this game if possible  its great", "\"When I first played Xenogears, I thought it was absolutely awesome.  Its been awhile, and after thinking about it this game is pretty messed up.  It has some good qualities, but isn't as incredible as I thought it was.First to mind is the characters.  They are really cool, and somewhat unique, like Billy the gun-toting priest, or Rico the arena battling green thing.  What could be better?  I did have some problems with the main character Fei though.  I have never been able to forgive games for having characters which refuse to fight \"\"because fighting is bad, and it kills people\"\".  Especially when their own and other's lives are on the line.  I can't stand that.  Anyway, Fei gets over it, and I got over it, but that is cliched, and quite frankly, lame.Xenogears has an excellent turn-based combat system.  It uses varying levels of attacks (you can do 4 or 5 light attacks, or 1 or 2 heavy ones), combines those with combo moves, and the ability to build up combo chains, to create a fun, challenging battle system.  There are magic attacks, of course, but they are almost always worthless (useless magic is another feature which annoys me).  The addition of Gear (giant robot) battles adds a lot more to the game.  Gear combat is essentially the same as normal combat, but they are tougher, have different moves, and tend to fight cooler bosses.  I don't think there were too many gear battles, but the second disk definitely could have used more unarmed combat (like I said, the characters are cool).The soundtrack is good, better than a lot of video game music, but I don't really remember anything spectacular about it.  The graphics are just okay, but Xenogears is old, and it is an RPG.  All in all, I didn't mind them.  They weren't good or bad enough to ever pay attention to.  The Xenogears jewel case claims that there are 10 minutes of Anime cut scenes.  There are about 30 seconds through most of the game, and 9 minutes at the end.  Although, Anime cut scenes fail to thrill me, in nearly every situation.Now, on to the story.  The plot line of Xenogears is potentially excellent, involving a nice mix of commentary on religion and ethics, and it was gratifying to have a change from \"\"Hero goes on a quest, saves the day, repeat\"\".  However, the story was flawed.  It was difficult to comprehend, and almost ruined, if not by its complexity, then by its poor translation.  The words the people say don't make any sense (especially towards the end).  In addition, most of the philosophical/religion/science/whatever stuff turns out to be sort of pointless (in a sort of \"\"lets have a cross somewhere, and maybe something about the purpose of life or something\"\" sort of way).  It is also full of the classic cut scenes that won't make sense until 25 hours later (or ever).  They add some ambiance, but several of them never do come back up again.  There were issues that left me scratching my head that were never resolved.  The ending itself was difficult and awesome.  It is worth it (at least, as worth it as any 60 hour game's ending will ever be).All in all, Xenogears is probably one of the best Playstation RPG's out there.  It might be somewhat overwhelming to younger players or those new to the RPG genre (although, it was only the third non-Genesis RPG I ever beat, and I was 14 at the time).  Xenogears is a classic that should be played by every RPG fan.  I highly recommend it.\"", "Every now and again a videogame comes along that attempts to do something too few strive for. Rpg's are known for their heavy reliance on story and character relationships, but few ever really do anything about it. Xenogears is the RPG that does not follow the curve, but instead breaks it and reshapes it.I've only played one other series that compares in theme and storytelling, Metal Gear Solid. The thing that sets them both apart is the value the developer's placed in creating a rich history and backbone to support the gaming world built on top of it. The story in this game touches on everything from philosophy and the meaning of life, to racism and the ongoing desire of humanity to view the world as group of seperate nations instead of seeing as what it really is, the same planet we all live on and try to survive on. The psychological figure that is the main hero, Fei Fong Wong, is something that only FFVII has tried to do with a chracter. The story is mostly about his torn identity. It is played out over the stage of the world and has more to do with the rest of humanity than he seems to realize. Does that mean he's the only character with real, human prodblems? Absolutelly not. His love interest is just as mentally fragile, as are all of the characters that take this amazing journey with him. This story is set against the backdrop of religion and the effect our actions will and do have on the planet we live on, which in turn effects all of our famalies for generations to come. Does this sound like an impossible task to take, trying to sum up all of these themes and stories in a piece of software that will only last about 40-50 hours? In most cases, it is, but not in the case of Xenogears.The gameplay does not take a backseat to any of this, however. The battle system was, and still is, unique and invigorating. It is a unique blend of turn-based combat and combo-driven mechanic's that always keep you on your toes. The graphics and music were about as high quality as you could get at the time. There is enough gameplay to keep you playing this game for upwards of 70 hours on your first playthru. There are cutscenes that show the war of nations played out through the use of giant robots and battleships that stir the senses. I can't overplay how much qaulity was put into this game's gameplay, and never at the expense of the bigger picture.If you never play this game, you're only hurting yourself by not having had one of the most incredibly rich gaming experiences of all time. This game should be emulated by all, but its pretty damn hard to follow such a class act.", "\"After playing Xenosaga, I was quite eager to pick this game up in some way.  Unfortunately, somehow Crash Bandicoot made the greatest hits collection, and great games like Xenogears are forgotten, but I was fortunate enough to drop the name near a kid who had a cousin who had a copy, which I was glad to purchase, since the cousin didn't like it.I must admit, I was somewhat disappointed with the battle system.  Although it can be fun at times, it lacked the luster that the Materia and Sphere Grid systems had in the world of Final Fantasy, simply making battles mediocre button pushing.  The slightly dull combat system wouldn't have been so bad if battles had taken any strategy, but, for the most part and with a few exceptions near the very end, battles are mostly just using your strongest combo and healing yourself when necessary.  Once you get Billy in your party, you become practically invincible, since he is able to heal the entire party for more than 300 HP for a paltry 4 EP.  The best aspect of the game's combat system, however, would be the gear system.  Although not used as well as in Xenosaga, Xenogears makes gear combat fun by separating it from the status of the characters, but also giving the gears abilities based on the abilities of the character riding them.  Fighting in gears, however, is always done in a way that you can't win without them, or you can't use them.  The only times you'll have access to your gears is on the world map and in places with large enemies that would crush a party on foot.  This is once again a place where SquareSoft could have added strategic elements (benefits of battling in gear Vs. on foot, an element used brilliantly in Xenosaga), yet decided to opt for simpler battles for a more complex story line.The music in Xenogears, composed by the brilliant Yasunori Mitsuda of Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross fame, was terrific for it's time, but with the quality sound that the PS2 is able to put out, Xenogears music will just get dull, especially to the ear of one who has played Xenosaga.  Also, like in many other RPGs, Xenogears music is extremely repetitive, especially during the second disc.  The theme song for this game was done by Joanne Hogg, and is verysimilar to the theme songs from Xenosaga, using the exact same instrumentation and style, yet Hogg's voice just has that enchanting quality which I haven't yet tired of.Xenogears' story is where it shines, and earns its entire five stars.  Xenogears takes elements of religion, fantasy, and sci-fi and mixes them to create the uplifting, suspenseful story of youngFei's search for the truth (and escape from it) in a world of lies.  Enter the character of Elhaym, the beautiful soldier who happens to stand at odds with Fei due to her birth and origin, who changes Fei forever by showing him the joy of love.  Each character has his or her individual motive, from the villains to the heroes, each trying to find what they most desire.  Some wish for power, others for love, and others simply answers to life's most difficult questions.  From the beginning of the first disc, you are propelled from Fei's quiet existence in a small village in the woods toward the flying cities of Shevat and Solaris to the paradise Mahanon.  The second disc, unfortunately, falters, as the action is greatly reduced, and the game becomes almost a series of monologues telling us what happened and how.  For a good example, imagine if the scene whereLuke and Han rescue Princes Leia in Star Wars were replaced with Luke and/or Han sitting in a chair saying, \"\"We then traveled to the Death Star to save the Princes.  We found out that she was being held in a certain cell and saved her, but on the way out, we encountered some guards (picture in background of the heroes and storm troopers engaged in fighting), we only survived by jumping down a hole into a trash compactor...\"\" etc.  This gets somewhat obnoxious, but I'm sure that this was only done to save space and avoid the obvious irritation of having a third disc for the end movies.  If you're completely into the game's story, you won't mind the dialogue bits too much, since they allow you to skip over some annoying bits that would keep you from getting to the incredible conclusion.For those Xenosaga Fans out there, this game will make a great hold over until Feb. 15, when Episode 2 comes out.  I know I'm going to be at Wal-Mart at opening to get my copy.\"", "\"Xenogears is an odd game that manages to both excel and fail horribly at the same time.GRAPHICS / VISUALSFor the time it came out in, the graphics are decent.  When exploring sometimes becomes difficult to navigate when underground though, becuase the low-res washed out \"\"rock/earth\"\" textures all blur together making it difficult to tell if something is a wall, or has something you can jump onto, etc.  Also, while the game allows you to move the camera, it's just a token gesture since you can't change the elevation or distance.  Oftentimes you'll be completely unable to see the character as he goes between two tall buildings or things like that.The game features some anime cutscenes which are, unfortunuately, mostly worthless.  They're well drawn, but are often nothing more than something like 2 characters staring at eachother for 5 seconds; with the exception of the ending almost no plot ever happens during them.The combat visuals, however, are great for its time.  The characters do more than just move up and swing a sword.  You can chain different moves together (and learn deathblows, which are powerful combinations) that are usually visually appealing.  For instance, a character will run up, punch, jump in the air and do a sping kick, sweep the enenmy as they land and then finish off with a headbutt.GAMEPLAYWhile the combat graphics are nice for its era, it also makes the battles take too long (and boy are they frequent, often 1 random encounter/ 2 seconds of movement).  It's like final fantasy summons all over again, making each combat last minutes upon minutes...even when you fight the enemies from level 1 when you're level 60 it still takes forever.There is a bit of load time anytime you change rooms/go into your character menu etc. Very annoying.My 2 biggest complaints are:The dialogue is waaaaaaay too slow.  There is a lot of excessive dialogue, a lot of repetition, and it comes on the screen so slow you'd think a 4-year old child was typing it.  Sometimes you will have to go through an hour and a half worth of this only to get to a difficult part in the game, die, and have to go through all of that dialogue again without the chance to save in between.Secondly, as many reviews here have pointed out, the 2nd disc is drastically different.  I thought people were exaggerating; they were not.  It happens suddenly.  Exactly at the point you put the second sic in, most exploration is taken away from you.  A character literally sits in a chair and tells you what happened.  It becomes 1 hour of dialogue, then fight.  2 hours of dialogue, then fight, etc.  You get to explore again though right before the very last dungeon.CHARACTERS / STORY / PLOTThis is where the game is good...for the most part.In typical squaresoft fashion (or is it just all Japanese RPGs?) the main character is fairly UNlikable.  He's whiny, immature, a jerk even though he means well, and at times a bastion of self-sacrifice and purity in the name of good willing to risk everything for some small good and pulling it off through rediculous Deus Ex Machina.Fortunately, in typical squaresoft fashion, the supporting cast is well done.  There's a suprising depth to most of the characters, above and beyond most games I've seen.  Most are mature, and the game itself brushes with some mature topics of innosence, when is war right/justified, the cost of it and what its worth to end one.The story is a bit overlarge.  It's good, but needed an editor to trim it down a bit as it just gets too big for its britches by the end of the game.Overall I enjoyed the game.  I'm glad to have played it, but some of the gameplay problems means I have no desire to ever play it again.\"", "I'm not sure what a lot of these haters are saying I've had this game for many years way before the greatest hits came out and to this day I still go and play it. This is my top 3 of favorite RPGs its so good great story and you can jump on a old RPG its amazing"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10403405129909515, 0.024764254689216614, 0.0031095624435693026, 0.18805105984210968, 0.0020507844164967537, 0.004930225666612387, 0.20550121366977692, 0.005062114913016558, 0.13343000411987305, 0.007340467534959316, 0.020510980859398842, 0.16790375113487244, 0.11075009405612946, 0.0016313696978613734, 0.020930124446749687]]}
