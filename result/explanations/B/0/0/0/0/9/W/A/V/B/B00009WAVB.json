After having finished the entire game in about six hours, I'm a little dissapointed. The graphics are incredible, it's obvious EA's advanced them well beyond where they were for even Frontline. But the A.I. is still not too bright except for perhaps the Guadalcanal invasion level. The rest of the levels the enemy just isn't too bright and you can mow them down easily.I did enjoy the different types of missions however. In this game rather than most of the missions set in towns like Frontine, they're set in towns (including one part in a hotel) but a few are also in the jungles of Pacific islands, which is a fun change, including one where you've got to go running through a wrecked train.However, the missions just seem too short. I was shocked at how fast I could complete every mission except perhaps two where I got lost and had to find the right way back again. The in level saves probably are the difference as to why every mission seems shorter, but I think they're a bonus because if you die you don't have to completely re-do a level if you've saved.PRO--1. Graphics are great2. Added gameplay including riding an elephant and also missions where you're in a PT boat at Pearl Harbor and using AA guns. As well as a tail gunner for an airplane in the final mission.3. In game saves lessen frustrationCON--1. A.I. still needs work, the enemy is still not too bright2. Missions are too short, the game could have been longer.I have read that this is part I of a two part series, with part II coming out sometime in 2004. There is a cliffhanger at the end of this game, I hope the next release perhaps takes us all the way to Japan. THAT would be fun!", "This game is awful. Very bad graphics by a first person shooter. Ugly, bland enviroments with bad atmosphere. Seems they went bachward from the first one. They now added a multiplayer mode witch is essential to a good FPS, tobady is sucks. I never understood what was going on and it is easy to get lost in the jugle witch all looks the same to me. Get red faction 2 instead. Did't live up to the standard as the first one and is a huge disappointment.", "This is my favorite game. The grafics are great. My dad even plays it. Everyone is saying they beat it n 2-4 hours. That is impossible to do. It took my that long to get to the 3rd level. There are 9 levels. It has multiplayer and multiplayer campain like in Halo. You get to pick how smart the computer people are in multiplayer. In the first level you have to get out of a battleship then you get on the deck and shoot down Japenese planes with a anti-aircraft gun. When your ship gets bombed you become the gunner on a U-Boat. Its really cool. After you defend the battleships you beat that level. In the next level your in the Philepies. You have to get back a lost amunition truck and safley cross the burning bridge. The next level is the hardest. You have to survive a midnight raid on a enemy camp. The next 5 levels are cool too but my favorite one is the last level. You have to destroy a enemy aircraft carier. After you set it on fire you hop in a plane with a british soldier and fly around the carier shooting planes with the back guner. Its really fun being the back guner. If you liked Medal of Honor Frontline you would like Medal of Honor Rising sun.", "As the Sequel to MoH: Frontline I tought MoH: Rising sun would be the best game EVER, but I soon dicovered that it was nothing more than a cheezy scam in order to make money, the best part of the whole game is the opening, when your in Pearl Harbor defending a ship. And that's vaguely satisfying.MoH:The Rising Sun is a terrible game stemming from what seemed like a great Idea, I mean it looks so awesome on the commercials, but it really isn't that great, MoH:RS (Rising Sun) is very short, only a couple of missions.The graphics are maybe a little better than they were in Frontline but not noticable to the untrained eye.Really MoH:RS had loads and LOADS of potential, but it was put out onto the market not only too early, but too expensively, I mean the game is just a little bit longer than a demo for SOCOM or MA:GitS, its a terrible game, that seems like there was barely any effort put into it.RENT this game if you are interrested, but as a warning, it's not really worth the rental money. In summary MoH:RS is a great concept carried out terribly and severely poorly made, this game was a waiste of time and money to the producers, and a waiste of money to you and, if it was long enough, a waiste of time.", "This is a great MOH game and it is one of my favorite today. It has ten missions on it and it is short but it is worth it. The graphics r good for the background but the people and the guns r not very good. The war is in japan and the missions r in the water, citi, jungle, on a ship, and in a village that goes into a baseball field. It is amazing of how addicting it gets so u cant stop. The music changes as what the act is like, like it changes to fast pace if u have to hurry to do somthing but most of it is japanese. It has the best multiplayer out of all of the MOHs because u can battle up to four people on the same team or against each other. U can even be by ur self on multiplayer but u r against cpus. U can choose how many and whoever u want on ur team or who u want to go against. There r so many places to battle at too and u get to choose how many minutes u want to play and what guns u want to use and either do free for all or team deathmatch. There is two player mission too so u can do missions with ur friends. This is my favorite MOH for the ps2 and it has the best multiplayer.", "This game was highly anticipated, but sadly it falls short of what it could have been.First off, format wise, they throw in a Multiplayer mode, sadly missing from the PS2 version of Frontline.  They also support online play.  These features are great--the bots in Multiplayer can be tough.  So what happened to the AI in the regular mode?Overall, the first player mode falls short.  These EA shooters are all starting to look the same.  I loved the Bond games, they were fun and captured the spirit of the movies.  MoH Frontline was fantastic as well.  Rising Sun has a lot going for it, but sometimes feels like they just got lazy.For one, the game is very easy.  I finished this game in about two days, effectively.  There is very little strategy involved, and the computer AI is plain bad.  The Japanese soldiers are, of course, lousy shots, and at times will just charge right into the barrell of your gun.  The game gives you computer controlled teammates so you can fight side by side, but as can be expected, that AI is pretty awful, making the feature useless.  Your partners are bumbling buffoons.  I also found myself running around certain boards trying to figure out where to go and what action to perform, something that rarely happened in the first one or in the Bond games.The graphics are very good, the sound is awesome, but there are some things missing.  There is hardly any interaction with the surroundings aside from what you must do to finish a board.  It may seem like a small thing, but it's just lazy.  You can't open any doors except for ones that are essential to you finishing a board.  You can't break random things and shoot up rooms, something that both the Bond games and Frontline had.  There are some new features, such as the opening bit of manning a carrier gun during the Pearl Harbor attack and shooting down 0 fighters, or riding an elephant.  But again, it's all way too easy.  Matter of fact, I actually couldn't believe I finished the game when I did, the last mission hardly offers a challenge for a first person shooter.  And the Pearl Harbor opening is nowhere near as tough or as new as the D-Day landing of the original.I dropped fifty bucks on this game when it came out, and the only reason I'm not selling it back used is the multiplayer option, which still doesn't make it a great value.  I think MoH fans will find a lot to like, but the game could have been much better.You have more weapons, and some great looking boards, including very realistic jungles.  I did find myself getting lost on boards and getting frustrated because of the layout, but in the end, like the original and like Bond, the game just guides you through the missions on autopilot.  Even timid first person shooter fans will finish this game in no time.Of course, the game is bloodless and carries a teen rating, which is a shame.  I don't understand why they try to sanitize a WWII game, but it's EA, and I guess they want a bigger market.I'm hoping the 3rd person Bond game next year will be a lot better.  I was looking forward to this, now I need to go out and buy something with a little more replay value.", "The Good: World War II movie clips are interesting, you can use cheat codes, new arsenal of weapons, fun opening levelThe Bad: Wonky controls, terrible AI, boring gameplay, horrid framerate, ugly visuals, an overall lack of polishPearl Harbor was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the US, and was what got us involved in World War II. EA decided to leave the frontlines of Europe and head to Hawaii at Pearl Harbor and into the Japanese and Philippine frontlines. It's a nice change of scenery, especially back in the day when WWII shooters were coming out nearly every day. The problem is, Rising Sun is a reskin of Frontline with the lack of polish, detail, and just doesn't feel complete. Rising Sun needed about 6 months more of development before being anything remotely decent. What we have here is a sluggish, boring, and mediocre shooter, probably one of the worst shooters of 2003.The game actually starts out pretty nicely. The bombing of Pearl Harbor feels epic in this game, you are just a nobody sailor who gets woken up by the bombings. After you see the poorly pre-rendered cut scene you start controlling your guy and it feels very similar to Frontline, too similar. Right off the bat you realize the control issues haven't changed. The aiming is really sensitive and finicky, there's no iron sights aiming, and the controls just suck still. Once you run around the boat trying to escape you notice you can save at checkpoints. This is actually one of the only two major issues that were fixed from Frontline. The missions are very long and you no longer have to start at the beginning of every level when you die.Once you get out you notice the framerate is worse than Frontline. The FPS drops into single digits often and it actually affects gameplay. Trying to shoot someone when the game is chugging along at 5 frames a second is nearly impossible. It doesn't help that the aiming is already wonky. The change of pace in the beginning using the turret on the boat and shooting down planes is fun, I also have to mention that the only great part of Rising Sun is the music. Medal of Honor has a fantastic score across all the WWII games, but Rising Sun needs more than that to save it.Once you start the next level you realize the game is just so bad. The level design is abysmal with confusing mazes, it was cute for EA to try to make you feel like you have multiple paths but you really don't. It just makes things more confusing. There are also secondary hidden objectives this time around but they are nearly impossible to figure out, hell even the regular objectives are hard to figure out. Items don't flash so you can't tel if it's part of the scenery or something you need to interact with. Most of the time you just get lucky when a prompt comes up on screen when you pass something.I like the new selection of weapons, the shotgun, Type 99, Sten MKII, and a few other Pacific Theatre weapons. That's probably the only other great change from Frontline, but the guns control so horribly that you won't care. The most annoying part of Rising Sun is the forced and failed implementation of stealth. During one of the last few levels you get recruited into the OSS and have to infiltrate a Japanese summit at a hotel. The game gives you the Welrod which is a one shot silenced pistol. Sure that's fine, but Rising Sun wasn't built for stealth. I shot the first few people silently then all of a sudden I was being attacked. I had to run around the whole level with just a pistol and the Welrod. Not very fun. The hints say to stick to the shadows and stay in the column areas. Yeah sure what shadows? The stealth is just completely broken, but at least healing items give you more health so the game is a bit easier in that regard.Let's finally talk about graphics, the game is butt ugly, even uglier than Frontline. During the jungle levels the devs just put a flat texture of a forest on the walls. Yeah good jobs you lazy jerks. The game is just ugly and is so unpolished. The events in the game are so unbelievable that it's hard to think that these things actually happened. Did I mention there's still no blood? The last thing to go is the terrible AI. The friendly AI just stands there while they're being shot and completely ignore enemies, the multiplayer is also as boring as ever.Rising Sun sold millions of copies, but couldn't live up to the previous games quality. With ugly graphics, horrible framerate, terrible AI, bad level design and various other issues, Rising Sun stands as one of the worst games in the series.", "The 2 Player Cooperative Genre is a small genre indeed.  It had it's fun in Arcades with such games like Gauntlet.  It was popular in the Nintendo world with Ikari Warriors and other hack and slash games as well.  Socom is probably the best multiplayer cooperative, but requires online play, and really isn't fun when two players are in the same room.  Games such as Desert Conflict 2 could have been perfect if they got the level design and save points correctly, but the genre never reached that pivotal point until now.Granted it's not perfect, but it sure is fun and mesmerizing while it lasts.  First off, the atmosphere is amazing.  It really feels like you're in the jungle with all these enemies in camouflage attacking you.  There is a bit of strategy involved as you have to discuss who goes where and who gets health.  The game only ends when both players die, so sometimes you have stay back to let the other one take the hits.  Really fun.  Most levels require trekking through a jungle, fighting enemies, and completing objectives.  The graphics and scenery are not only fitting, but play well with the level design perfectly.Yes, there is also a single person  mode, but from what I hear, it's nothing compared to Medal of Honor: Frontline.Here's the bad though: The gun controls (I use a standard PS2 controller), are jerky, and the player's movements are a bit too slow.  The first level consists of you walking up a ship and then firing lots of gun fire from stationary guns.  While the atmosphere is beyond impressive, it gets old after a while.  There are about 5-6 missions total, and unfortunately, a friend and I finished it just 5 hours on the normal setting.There is also online play, which is somewhat cool in that exists.  The online play, however, only consists or Quake like deathmatch and team deathmatches.  No cooperative level game play like Socom.  Unfortunately, the people who do play are not that fun to talk to, and are quite the First Person Shooter Nerds who will kill you as soon as you turn a corner.  It really only works when you can get enough people for a private room.All in all, it's a great game with great atmosphere, but way too short.Pros:Great atmosphereSuperb two player cooperative modeAt least has some type of online playLevels are intuitiveCons:Way Too shortFirst two missions are pointlessSave points have to be found, cannot save anywhereJerky gun controlsOnline play is boring, ruined by FPS nerdsHours to Complete (Cooperative): 5 hours (normal setting)Difficulty Level: EasyFrustration Level: Non-existent", "Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not exactly what you'd expect from the MOH franchise. In fact, compared to previous installments this one is dangerously weak in a few departments.  The game has it's highs and lows and while the PS2 has online play, that doesn't make it much better than the other platforms.To begin, the graphics aren't up to date with today's current standards.  Just as simple as maybe two years ago these graphics would be a little better but the fact that the layout of levels is dismal and not much color and texture went into the landscapes is a little disappointing.  If you ignore the environments and such, the graphics of say...the characters or the weapons don't look that bad, in fact they're decent but looking at some of the landscapes made me feel like I was playing my outdated PSX again.The music in this game, however, is top-notch and doesn't sound that different from other Medal of Honor games. So the soundtrack is outstanding!  Sound effects are great too.  Gunshots sound good and the voice acting isn't bad. So sound is certainly a nice edition to the game.The gameplay is a MAJOR department where this game could've used some improvement.  Things that worked well in the past MOH games don't stand out in this one.  Such as enemy AI.  As I said, they needed to keep up with the times.  MOH has usually presented a bit of realism and in this one it is completely lost!  For example, enemy AI is decreased. I stood in front of two enemies and shot one of them until he was dead while his partner just stood there and watched.  Then I had to reload, and while I was doing so the enemy still stood there. When I was finally done reloading he finally attacked.  The next result was that I shot him 15 times: IN THE HEAD!  This is NOT realism at all.What's also strange about the realism is that shooting an enemy in the leg with a shotgun actually causes them only to jump around on one foot for a while and then they recover and act as if nothing happened, almost as if the shot never took place.But the gameplay does have it's high points.  It's still a little fun to play.  You start off at the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Medal of Honor is always good at giving us this intense war feeling and Rising Sun does this to perfection. So the levels are complex, each taking about 30-60 minutes each to complete and this was actually pretty nice so the game does have longevity.Plus, the game features a few historical videos with a great narrator to present them. So the game has several extras to behold and completeing missions only unlocks more.The multiplayer, I can't help but admit, was a bit of a letdown.  It's nice to play the multiplayer with a friend but it becomes boring after a while. You select the weapons that you want to battle with, which are no different than what the MOH verteran is used to.  What makes the multiplayer a drag for the PS2 is it's online capability.  Yes, I like to play games online as well, but with this, it's no different than if you played it with just yourself and a friend.  No new, or extended, maps or new weapons and all the character animations look very identical to one another.The co-op on the game was nice to behold. There is actually a differene in the gameplay this way, such as player one will have to do things for player two to advance forward.  Makes the game a little more involving for both players.So while Medal of Honor Rising Sun isn't a terrible game, it isn't really good either.  It's worth maybe a rent or two and if you can get past the very unrealistic gameplay it may even be worth the buy.  But I can't help but think what a few more months in developement would've done to it.", "This game is just all right.  We enjoy playing it on 4 player &amp; teaming up.  I wish there was an option for auto target or an option to see your man but there's not.  The boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer.  I think this is a good game to rent but don't recommend purchasing it.", "What more can I say. Well, the newest and latest edition to the Medal of Honor franchise is here and available on the Playstation 2. Of course it would be better than Frontline because it is a new and up to date game. But some things have changed and some things haven't. Of course EA would keep the game in first person mode, but there has been some slight alterations that have made this MOH unique. Like the fact that there are bonus/hidden objectives and that at the end of each mission you are graded on 3 different things: Hits Taken, Accuracy, and Bonus Objectives completed. All of these categories makes getting a medal a very tough and a challenging thing indeed. Also you can find certain items that will aid you later on in the game and make things much easier, but you have to look for these things.Now let's talk about the levels. Well to say the least, these levels are huge!! I'm not kidding. The Day of Infamy level (Pearl Harbor) is very well done and is fun to play over and over again. But most of the action takes place in the jungle (duhh! You're fighting the Japanese around the Philippine Islands) and the Japanese pop up in the most unlikely places and ambush you from behind. So watch your back. And like I said before, the levels are massive. There are so many different paths to take you could easily become confused, but they're fun all the same.Next we are going to discuss weapons. Well there is not a whole lot to talk about. There has not been that many changes. You will have the usual M1 Garand and the ever faithful Thompson SMG, and yes you have your Shotgun, and your Bazooka, and oh yes, your standard Mark II Frag Grenades to chuck at some holed up Japs.So now you want to talk about controler capabilities. Well let me say this, there has been a slight change since Frontline. The throw Grenade and Reload weapon capabilities have their own separate buttons which really uses up all the buttons on the controller and their are more controller layouts than Frontline had available.So there you have it. Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is yet another great game from Electronic Arts and if I have heard and seen correctly, there will be a sequel to this game (the first sequel for the Playstation MOH series) which continues this game's story.Bottom Line: Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a really great game to open up a new theater of World War II."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03370695933699608, 0.19306859374046326, 0.16138023138046265, 0.09401237964630127, 0.2341664433479309, 0.005159508902579546, 0.03837944194674492, 0.02690598927438259, 0.0028483557980507612, 0.11465640366077423, 0.0957157239317894]]}
