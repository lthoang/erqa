This set is lighter (though not as durable as the PMX100's), has a lower profile which allows you to rest your head back on an airplane, and are more muted in terms of their design...more classy in a sense.However, the PMX100 most definitely takes the prize in terms of sound quality with a broader range and deeper bass. Though, it should be noted that this set has a higher decibel output...not always the most important factor.With all of this in mind, the PMX60 is in my opinion the perfect set of everyday use headphones. Better sounding than the packaged ipod headphones, cheap enough to the point where you won't be angry if you lose em, ridiculously light and comfortable (if you like behind the neck sets), and attractive to boot.", "If you are like me and like behind-the-neck headphones for getting around town and at the gym, and was baffled by Sony's redesign of their streetwear series then these are for you.Sound is comparable to my old MDR-g72's, maybe even better.  They are much better looking than the new Sony or Koss models, and they are much more comfortable than any lightweight headphones around.  Also they seem well-made (compared to my Sporta-pros) and stand up well to normal wear and tear. They are super-loud on my iPod nano compared to the new low-end sony models.  They are also reasonably priced.Three issues:-I wish they folded up like my old Sony's.-They do leak a lot of noise, probably because they are so rockin' loud and lightweight.  Be aware of this on the subway or the plane.-My first pair has acquired a rattle in one ear, not unlike what eventually killed my old faves.GO FOR IT", "Comfortable, great sounding and won't break at the backband like most of the cheapies. You won't be sorry!", "I would guess I've tried at least a couple dozen sets of headphones and earbuds with various iPods over the past five years or so. I'd place these Sennheisers in the upper half of the pack for sure. For less than $20, they have very good sound and they're comfortable to wear. I haven't had them long enough to really make a call on durability, but they seem well made and feel solid.I listen mostly to acoustic music, with some rock, jazz, and classical thrown in. These headphones have a pretty good range, but I'm not sure they'd be right for someone who listens to very bass-heavy music.Some reviewers have complained about sound leakage, but it's not really a concern for me. I primarily use these headphones for listening to music and podcasts on my iPod when I walk my dogs. I wanted headphones that didn't cut me off from environmental sounds -- I want to be able to hear traffic, dogs barking, people calling out, etc. And if you don't buy sound isolating headphones, leakage is pretty much part of the deal. And I seldom play music loud enough to be a real nuisance to anyone nearby.All in all, I'd recommend these headphones as long as you understand that you'll be sharing your musical tastes -- at least to some extent -- to anyone close by.", "I like the sound qulity of the headphones. The only negative is that the around the neck band is NOT adjustable.", "I would not consider myself as a hard core Audiophile but I am certainly headed that way.  Let me share with you first of how many things I am listening to (same type of content generally but different outlets to hear from)In the Gymrecently moved from the [Bose TriPort In-Ear Headphones - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - black toSennheiser PMX60 Headphonesin both cases being played on theApple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (2nd Generation)ORApple iPod Video 60 GB Black MA147LL/A (5th Generation)The bose definitely has deeper base but Sennheiser delivers on loudness. Someone had complained earlier that its too loud where other can hear around you. I find this to be a feature actually because the gym showers don't have and sound or music there.  Just crank these up and you can instantly hear music!In the car (2006 Lexus GS300)There is very good sound imaging in this card mark&Levinson; system. So I really enjoy that clarity in the car via the native CD changer.The home studio:Podcaststudio Firewire BundleIn the living RoomWell the living room is the grand slam setup of:Polk Audio Monitor Series CS2 Center Channel Speaker (Single, Black)So sadly this review has turned into a listing of my stuff. So to make things simpler:These headphones are noAudio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphoneson an airplane obviously but they are perfect for those heavy and fast workouts!I was worried that on some exercises this will hurt my neck or something but doing everything in the gym from aerobics to glider run, it fits well and sounds great! Of course the price is just right as well.  If your looking for something that will compliment your listening all around, these headphones will do the trick.UPDATED STATUS ---- DONT GET THESE! They last about 1 yearThis set despite its sound quality prowess, did not last a full year! The year barrel and the inside tweeter just came off! Next thing i know it got yanked out of  their place -- it looks really crappy! i am so sad cause i had love the sound in these and comfort. Let me enlist what i have tried so far:Apple Earbuds (White with Gray Earbuds)these just kept falling offBose In-Ear Headphonesthese just kept falling off + they developed gunk on the plastics after a while of usage (but the sound is awesome)Sennheiser PMX60 HeadphonesWell these sadly just broke under a year! but amazing sound!Now will try theSennheiser CX380 Sport Series II Noise Isolating Earphonesafter reading several hands on reviews of people! Will let you guys know how it works out. In the meantime don't forget to check out [...]", "I've owned 6 pairs of the Sennheiser PX100 over the years.  I always keep 2 pairs on hand in case I break one of them.  Well the PX100 have been discontinued and have been replaced by a $70 new model.  That's insane.  I went on EBay and purchased some old Px100 but they were counterfeit!!  So be careful there!  I decided to try these PMX60.  I have to say I'm very happy.  They are actually louder than the PX100 but do lack some of the bass the PX100 have.  The bass is still good just not as good as PX100.  I tested them both and have actually been wearing these more than my PX100.  They don't hurt around the back of head like an old Sony pair I've had in the past.  You can buy almost 4 of these for price of new PX100's.", "\"I would largely agree with many of the reviews here.  If found the sound levels to be robust, and the frequency reproduction to be above average.  I have trouble with any sort of in-the-ear phones, whether they are the \"\"over\"\" or earbud type.  I've found these to be extremely lightweight and fairly comfortable.The only drawback is yes, others could potentially hear your music selections if they are in the same room, and the volume is cranked a bit.  But for those who do not like in-your-ear, or covering-the-ear designs (hot, sweaty, hairdo issues), this is a nice compromise.For the price, they are a very reasonable and satisfying choice.\"", "Sound quality is acceptable.  It's clear but the bass response is limited.Comfort is very good.  My ears are sensitive to the pressure from headphones.  I can wear these for over an hour with no discomfort.Since they're the open ear type they're not the ideal choice for wearing on public transportation or in elevators.", "I like them so far (after about a week). They sound good (for what they are). It's hard to find ones like these in stores. Amazon saved me yet again. I've liked previous Sennheiser products that I've used and this one continues that trend.I dislike earbuds and though the ones that came with the Zune sounded fine they made my ears feel uncomfortable. Also I worried about the issue of volume and not being able to hear sounds from outside. With these I can walk safely due to being able to hear cars and other sounds well.Edit: Six months later and they are still performing well. They've held up to the wear and tear of being wrapped up into my coat pocket much of the time I am not using them. (It's cold where I live.) No loss in volume in either ear, and the jack is holding up well.Edit2: 10 months after original purchase the earpad where the cord connects snapped off (though the cord itself remained intact, so that's a big plus) when tugged on by my niece. Sound was better with these but I got a pair of neckband earphones from another brand that are better designed. The fact the connection of the cord to both the earpad and jack held up leads me to keep it at the 4 stars I rated it originally. (That and they were much cheaper when I purchased them compared to now).", "I run 50 to 70 miles a week with an MP3 player, usually listening to books or lectures, wrapping up with music.  These headphones are very comforable, the sound is clear and crisp and I don't have to crank up the volume on my MP3 player to hear.But what really distinguishes these from some of the otherwise equally good headsets are how well they damp out the wind.  Even with in-ear buds, the wind can overwhelm the volume to the point you can't hear.  I've run with these in 20 mph wind, head-on, and could still hear adequately.  Yes, you can still hear the wind rush, but these are the best!"], "Gamma": [0.3333333432674408, 0.3333333432674408, 0.3333333432674408], "Beta": [[0.0008181327139027417, 0.0008529200567863882, 0.2795294225215912, 0.0009918548166751862, 0.35473257303237915, 0.0013973201857879758, 0.0006356047815643251, 0.0432337149977684, 0.31659096479415894, 0.0005751766730099916, 0.0006423189770430326], [0.000818127125967294, 0.0008529292535968125, 0.2795296907424927, 0.0009918531868606806, 0.3547325134277344, 0.0013973425375297666, 0.0006356019293889403, 0.04323366656899452, 0.3165907561779022, 0.00057517847744748, 0.00064231944270432], [0.0008181195589713752, 0.0008529233746230602, 0.2795296609401703, 0.0009918445721268654, 0.3547326326370239, 0.0013973322929814458, 0.0006355966906994581, 0.04323356971144676, 0.3165908753871918, 0.0005751739954575896, 0.0006423135637305677]]}
