After I completed it, I set it aside.  Coming back to it, it's still the second best game in my collection  (Deus Ex is hard to top).  If you enjoy FPS games, then you should give this a try.  It's a cut above the usual Doom and Quake type shooters, as you are allowed plenty of flexibility as to how your character performs in the game.  You are given upgrade points, and can put them towards whatever attributes you want..  which basically means you can play the game in a number of ways.  You aren't really given the freedom that a game like Morrowind or Deus Ex gives you, but the game does ask you to think about what you want to do, and it accommodates your decisions better than most games.However, after coming back a year later, the single player FPS part of the game isn't what keeps me playing it.  I'm addicted to the Light Cycle races, now.  The light cycles are the most innovative, hyper, and fun thing I've seen in a game in a long time.  I'd rather play Light Cycles than buy Half Life 2 at this point.Overall, this game has a lot to offer you.  It isn't the kind of game that you'll stop playing after it's done.  With the multiplayer and light cycle modes, you shouldn't be done with this game until the sequel comes around.", "\"After reading through several of the reviews here I've noticed that the single most common denominator is that the majority of us are 30-something males who saw this movie in the early 80's and have had a deep affection for the basic idea of it all. I mean, c'mon now, who wouldn't want a few days *inside* the computer in neon highlighted clothes while throwing a guided Identity Disc at people and get to drive around in a Light Cycle? No other movie I can think of screams for some kind of sequel quite the way TRON does (especially in todays' computer-driven world), and Buena Vista has tried to fill the gap with this awe-inspiring game.The plot revolves around an encroaching data corruption plague that threatens the computers of ENCOM, against the backdrop of a hostile takeover from rival corporation FCon (on paper it sounds like a Bill Gates-like boredom fest in the making, but it works out quite well). The main protagonist is Jet Bradley, son of Alan Bradley (voiced by Bruce Boxleitner himself), who is sucked into the computer world, a la Flynn, by Alan's brainchild computer program Ma3a (voiced by Cindy Morgan, Yori/Lora of the original movie). Needless to say the storyline is intriguing and wonderfully put into the aspect of the Digital World with such panache that I wonder how this game didn't do better sales than it did.Graphics wise this game is a virtual feast for the eyes. Where Doom 3 might hold the title for most visually realistic FPS this game is by far the most beautiful. Syd Meade's virtual world comes completely alive in this game, and to get to be *in* it is a dream come true. Almost every surface of every character and object is gorgeously highlighted by the cool neon lines of Tron-esque cyberspace. There is absolutely no other way to play this game but on the highest possible graphics setting because to put it even a smidge below that would be almost criminal.Gameplay is equally absorbing. You begin your stay in the computer world with your trusty disc weapon. There are a number of weapons you can pick up later in the game, such as the mesh Blaster (basically a machine-pistol), Suffusion (a cyber-shotgun), LOL (a sniper rifle), as well as a wide array of energy ball weapons. You'll find yourself highly reliant on your trusty disc though, and really there's nothing wrong with that as it's the most reliable weapon you have and a pure joy to use. In addition you can aquire various \"\"subroutines\"\" by downloading them from data bins located all over the digital world. These subroutines allow you to do various improved styles of combat, or give you armor bonuses, or can give you increased abilities such as jumping higher or running silently. Most subroutines start out as giant Beta versions which suck up a lot of space in your configuration, but can be upgraded to Alpha or Gold versions throughout the game, provided you can find the subroutine enhancement critter-thing (there seems to be one for each level). This increases the combat/power value of the subroutine while letting it take up less space in your configuration, thus allowing room for more. Quite clever indeed!One of the biggest sells of the game is of course the universally loved Light Cycle. No one who tries this game can deny what a long-dreamt about experience this alone is, and the inclusion of the Syd Mead-designed Super Light Cycle only sweetens the deal further. Cycles zip around on racing grids and every sound you remember from the movies is there, from the digital \"\"thwip thwip thwip\"\" of your cycle passing over grid lines to the fantastic sound of an opponent running into your light-trail. There are admittedly some rather odd (and questionable) maneuvers that your computer opponents can perform that will have you shaking your head in disbelief, but overall the Light Cycles half pay for the game by themselves.Jet begins his trek in the digital world hotly pursued by ENCOM's ICP's, basically Anti-Virus programs, who blame him for the spread of the corruption. With the help of Byte (an upgrade to Bit, from the movie) Jet travels from server to server, hard-drive to PDA, and all over cyber-creation. Some of these digital world locale's are genius in design and are pure fun to go through, notably the Net (complete with a pub called, quite cleverly, \"\"The Progress Bar\"\") to the old EN-8212 mainframe of movie fame. All the while Jet is pursued by ICP's and the corporate thugs of FCon, who seem obsessed with finding and capturing Ma3a.As gorgeous and engrossing as the game is there are a few weak spots that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 star review. Others have pointed out a dislike for the puzzle/key-finding aspect of the game, but I rather enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun exploring every nook and cranny of the Tron universe. But I will say that while most of the maps are great fun to experience there are a few that are outright frustrating. Right off the bat the PDA is a living, breathing nightmare to navigate and beat(can I get an Amen?). The old ENCOM mainframe is a lot of fun, no doubt, but something of a letdown when you discover that you can't find Tron himself but only a sparkly bubble known as the Tron Legacy Code. Further the FCon antagonists are quite a bit over the top in their sinister designs. The HR woman looked like she was on a 48 hour caffiene binge at any given time. And the tragically short encounter with the infamous digital Tank only left me wanting for more, in addition to the elsewhere-mentioned scarcity of Recognizers (the few times you see and hear them really bring this game out). And the ending was almost anti-climactic. This is a long game and to go successfully through it to an ending that was, shall we say, underwhelming at best, really just irks you.I should note though that Tron 2.0 is left open for a sequel story-wise, but that the luke-warm sales of this game probably told Buena Vista Games that it wasn't necessary. And that's what really saddens me because the Tron universe has a truly rabid following. The Light Cycles alone could make a fantastic game in and of itself, and it's included in the package! The ending leaves a number of questions. Where's Flynn? Is the CEO of FCon who I think he is? And most of all, where the heck is the sequel??? Overall a fantastic game that I find myself playing again and again! Fantastic work Buena Vista and Monolith!\"", "I have never said this before. And i doubt i'll ever say this again. There is not one thing i can think of that is wrong with this program. It's beautiful, Immersive, Musically uplifting , humorous , exciting , riveting , frightening ,and more adjectives i can't even come up with right now. I have just completed this game and i am already looking forward to another run through.  Disney had a hand in creating the most unique sim/shooter/rpg/anything else you can think of that has yet to be created. This is the next level in gaming. It all started with the vision of the first system shock pc game , was powerfully updated with the system shock 2 sequel. And, now, TRON 2.0 has stepped up to the plate to give us gamers every little sweet joy that we so love. This ran beautifully on my system. I have : 900 mhz athlon thunderbird -- 1 gig pc 133 ram -- 128 mg ddr geforce 4 4600 -- soundblaster audigy 2 -- 120 gig 7200 rpm hard drive. I pushed all of the graphics to the max and it does not even lag! NOT EVEN A LITTLE! Get past the fear of the cheesy nature of TRON and grab this game. It will grow on you and you will not want to stop playing!", "Tron 2.0 is a computer game that lets you enjoy many different types of gameplay, from shooting to puzzles and racing!Based on the classic sci-fi movie Tron, this game sets you in the 'future' where you are Jet Bradley, the son of the original Alan Bradley. Once again you're inside a computer trying to get out.It's amazing how far technology has come since those early days of Tron, and this game really shows it off. The graphics are great and really do an excellent job of having you feel like you're inside the movie. The sounds are just as good, reinforcing that idea. I highly recommend you rent the movie and watch it before you play, so you can appreciate just what a good job they did.Of course a great atmosphere can't make up for poor gameplay, but this is another area that Tron 2.0 shines. There is combat that is fast and furious with a variety of weapons, plus other games like the light cycle strategy that I've always enjoyed so much.You can play single player through the various areas or go on the net if you want to have a virtual world battle in a virtual world!", "\"The Good: Amazing graphics and effects, great sound effects, weapons look really cool, subroutine and level up system is intuitive, feels just like the movieThe Bad: Spotted cheesy dialogue, weapons consume too much energy, not enough enemies or bosses, Light Cycle races are far too few and shallow, no one's playing online, frequent bug crashes are annoyingThe first thing you'll notice in Tron is the amazing graphics and detail to them. It really feels like you're in the movie and inside a computer. Everything is bright and highly detailed and look exactly like the movie. The only people who'll really feel and appreciate the detail in the game are people who know a lot about computers. There are many terms and words that refer to more advanced computer users, me being one of them, so I understood everything. When you first start the game you feel really giddy and it's just so cool playing this game! Monolith did a great job with the number of weapons and their design. The weapons look really slick and the \"\"subroutine system\"\" that is here is effective and nicely done.You can find \"\"archive bins\"\" throughout the game that store permissions (which grant you access to move further in the game), subroutines, and emails that you can read that give you updates on what's going on outside the computer. The subroutine system is cut into 3 categories: Defense, Weapons, Utilities. You place them in a ring and every time you enter a new level you have different \"\"memory requirements\"\" which means you can equip more or less. You can also upgrade your subroutines through optimizers you can find which upgrade it from Alpha to Beta to Gold. Upgrading each step makes subroutines more powerful and take up less room. You can also upgrade yourself through a basic RPG type style. Then you have energy which weapons consume and so does downloading things.Now all this in theory sounds great but this game just wasn't thought through all the way. Even though weapons consume energy they take too much so you're just left with your weaker disc all the time. The makes battling many enemies and bosses annoying since you're constantly dodging and restarting the level. Speaking of restarting there are NO checkpoints anywhere and you have to CONSTANTLY quick save every step you take. The story is also somewhat confusing and the dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times. There aren't enough enemy types in the game, and the boss fights are all same. Micromanaging your subroutines is also annoying when they get infected while fighting off the Corruption. You have to manually disinfect them and it takes forever if you are badly infected.Now the errors and flaws are tollerable but they do get old near the end of the game. Speaking of that there are some bugs in this game that cause it to crash a lot near th end and as a result I couldn't finish the game (due to me quick saving right when it crashed so every time it loaded it reloaded the crash.) I also have to mention the Light Cycle races and they are few and shallow. There are 3 races in the whole game and even though you have power ups and all that its hard to get them and the races end too quickly. Half the time I wound up just moving around the grid until everyone killed themselves off so I could move on.This whole game feels really neat in the beginning but near the end you just wish it would hurry up and end. I didn't get a chance with online play since no one was on but I'm pretty sure it would have been neat. If you want a snazzy looking FPS experience then go for Tron 2.0 you will walk away pretty happy.\"", "\"\"\"Greetings, Program.\"\"Remember those days, when the original movie \"\"Tron\"\" came out? It was like seeing your fantasy there on the screen, a computer user transported into the world of the computer, seeing what it's like to play games from the inside. Back then, it was a distant futuristic vision to think along these lines. These days, as games have become more and more realistic, that faraway vision has gotten ever closer. \"\"Tron 2.0\"\" is, in some ways, the realization of it: a video game in which you play someone (once again) trapped in the digital world, playing games.In this sense, \"\"Tron 2.0\"\" completes the circle begun by the movie over 20 years ago.  It also takes the concept of \"\"Tron\"\" and brings it into the modern world, incorporating technology and terminology we use today into the overall idea. The metaphor continues to work very well for the game, as your character's advancement is gained through build points and version upgrades, special abilities can be attained in the form of subroutines, which can be installed or disabled from your program memory, and healing is gained from patch routines. At some points in the game, you may have to defragment, disinfect, or port some of your subroutines using procedurals within your program. Some of the environments you'll be travelling through include a PDA, a laptop, the Net, a router, and of course the Game Grids.Despite the updated framework, the original \"\"Tron\"\" is still clearly here. Your characters staple weapon is the Identity Disc, which can be upgraded and will be the weapon you have with you throughout the game. The look and feel of the game just screams \"\"Tron\"\" like nothing else, with the same clean lines and glowing environments that characterized the original film so perfectly. Recognizers, tanks, and Bits all make their appearances through the game. There are many references back to \"\"Tron,\"\" both direct and indirect, as the story progresses. And we mustn't forget the lightcycles, which are incorporated into the single-player story, as well as being playable in standalone form both on- and off-line. Frankly, the lightcycles alone are worth the cost of the game...more on that shortly.In terms of the technical stuff, \"\"Tron 2.0\"\" holds up quite well. The graphics are gorgeous. They meet and occasionally exceed the standard set by the film, and really allow the user to involve themselves in the story without interference. In one memorable level, one of the most vertiginous moments I've ever had in a game, the graphics go a long way to conveying the impression of height and distance and speed. The sound is excellent, particularly the effects and music, both of which work well throughout the game. The voice acting is excellent as well. The stability of the game is fairly good.  I experienced a few sudden crashes in key moments on my Windows 2000 machine, but for the most part I didn't have problems.The single-player story should sound fairly familiar. Jet Bradley, son of Alan Bradley from the original \"\"Tron,\"\" is brought into the digital world and must find his way out. In doing so he discovers a conspiracy to not only take over his father's company and their sought-after digitizing software, but taking over computer networks all over the world. As you play through you'll learn more about Jet and what's happened to Alan since the events of the film, as well as uncovering more and more of the plans of your enemies. It leads up to an ending which was a bit unsatisfying to me. In this game, getting there is definitely most of the fun.The multiplayer levels offer some good variety. You can participate in Disc Arena and Tournament play, which allows you to compete on some updated game grids using only your disc and your agility to defeat your opponents. There is also a Derez match, often called \"\"deathmatch\"\" levels for other games, in which you have a fuller arsenal to choose from and more room to fight in. And, of course, there's the lightcycle levels, which allow you to pit your skills on the lightcycle grids against other riders around the world. Now that I've finished the single-player game, I find myself spending a great deal of time racing other riders in my super ligthcycle, seeing who can run rings around who. It's completely addictive and I love it.\"\"Tron 2.0\"\" is great fun. Perfect for those who saw the film in the eighties and have always wanted to re-live it from within, but also just a good game for any gamer.  Fairly light, not easy but not too difficult, and playable by just about anyone. It has lots of replay value and should be enjoyed by kids of all ages. Drop yourself into the digital world for a while and give it shot.\"\"End of line.\"\"\"", "\"I was at first somewhat skeptical of this game; I'm both a huge First Person Shooter fan as well as an enthusiast of the original Tron movie.  When I heard they were making an FPS based on Tron I had mixed feelings; I was worried that the genre would provide an insufficient medium for the game and would turn off many potential player.  I'll be the first to admit that Tron 2.0 does cater to some of the more obvious gameplay cliches that are nearly everywhere in the FPS world.  Alot of the weapons in the game remind me of the generic weapon set in any FPS; you've got your sniper rifle (known as the LOL in this game), your shotgun, your rocket launcher (known as the ball launcher), etc.  The levels were also a tad linear, and while the game length was of a good length for the story, the game overall wasn't that difficult to complete.  That much was unrefreshing to say the least.Honestly though, none of that matters.  \"\"What?!\"\" you ask?  Tron 2.0 has a lot of features that, even if not totally unique, cumulatively make it an addictive and fun game experience.  The action is pretty much nonstop, and there are few puzzles (jumping and otherwise) to detract from the frenzy.  Learning to master the disk makes the game very rewarding as well; it's a versatile enough weapon that it is still useful even when playing on the hardest difficulty level, and gained experience from single player disk use carries over largely to multiplay.Furthermore, the graphics are completely immersive.  Though the game uses a Quake3 based engine which will soon be outdated, I'd never have guessed that just by looking at the game itself.  The level design and stylized nature of the game looks every bit as good as it did in the movie.  Trust me, it does.  Really.  From the \"\"glowy\"\" effect from characters in the movie to the virtual landscapes around you; the overall game looks totally beautiful and are creatively designed.  The best part is, you don't need a state-of-art system to enjoy the visuals; this game runs very well on a 1.0 ghz 512 MB RAM based system with a Geforce 3 (or Radeon 9200+) based system, and that's on med-high detail.The weapons you use, while being similar in function to many other FPS games, look very cool as well.  The LOL is my personal favorite and I use it almost exclusively along with the disk. When you whip the LOL out, instead of having it just magically appear for no good reason, you summon a bunch of geometric figures that inevitably flurry around your hands and form into the weapon, which looks totally sweet.  It, like every other weapon you collect, is an enhancement of 4 \"\"primitives,\"\" the basic weapons you can use no matter what.  You can get these special enhancements to these primitive weapons by collecting and using \"\"subroutines\"\" that you can find in boxes or defeated enemies.The voice acting in the game is top notch and features guest appearances like Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Bruce Boxleitner, and Cindy Morgan.  The music is AMAZING, and essentially consists of remixes of Wendy Carlos' original score from the first movie.Light cycle racing is also here as well, and as someone said on a Tron message board, \"\"it's like snake on crack.\"\"  That's very accurate to both the gameplay and the challenge, and it accomplishes this all while staying true in form to the movie.  There's even a grand prix mode that you can play through with only light cycle racing.Overall, I think this is a very well made FPS.  I enjoyed playing it and will likely pick it up again.  If you're looking for a more intense multiplayer experience then I'd recommend Battlefield 1942 or Jedi Knight 3, but if you want a more visually and atmospherically robust single player experience, this is the best you'll do on the PC.\"", "Tron 2.0 is a sequel to one of the legends that disney has unleashed--tron, imagine what it would be like living inside your computer as a good guy. Pretty cool!
