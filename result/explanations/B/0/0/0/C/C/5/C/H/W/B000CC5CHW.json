The storyline is good, the war sequences are the most fun yet, the minigames (particularly the fishing minigame) is entertaining, and yet, and yet...NOW LOADING...You will never get more sick of a screen, and truthfully, there is no excuse for it. After every battle, after going into any door, NOW LOADING, every time. Every time.The battles would be nice except that each one is about 10-15 seconds longer than it should be, due to the ridiculous amount of time necessary to enter and exit the battle screen. Couple this with an uncomfortably high encounter rate (in some dungeons, about 1 battle every 10 steps), and you are looking at hours spent waiting for battles to begin and end. Were it not for this (very noticeable) flaw, Suikoden V may have given Suikoden II a run for its money. As it is, it'll have to settle for second.I won't spoil any of the story, but I will say that if you know Suikoden II, there are MANY more ties to that game other than Georg Prime. Moreover, the story is interesting enough to survive the incredibly slow beginning (it took about 6 hours for the game to get off the ground!) and the overly long battles. Nearly 60% of the Stars of Destiny must be discovered on your own (i.e. they won't join merely as part of the progression of the game), and there are numerous sidequests involved in finding them. Unfortunately, the load times really hamper the experience (and frankly, I see no excuse for them, as this is the 3rd offering from Konami on the PS2 - haven't they figured out the hardware yet?).", "this is the original suikoden gameplay revival. after I  playing  suikoden , and suikoden II.this game is the  best of all on every aspect of the suikoden games .history, gameplay, humor ,tragety, perfect score  even the price .a classic gem  as the  the original suikoden  buy one copy and keep it .final fantasy games are left on the dust with this game,with the exeption of FF#3 for the snes and 7 for the ps1.  and don't get me wrom final fantasy games still are my faborites but they lost the crown aster final fantasy 7. after that just mediocrecy games exemt for ff9.", "I'm not quite sure what I expected when I started Suikoden 5.  My first meeting with this series was Suikoden 3, which I enjoyed greatly.  Konami had made a definite effort to compete with the Final Fantasy series, and while they are different style games, the result for Konami was a genuinely compelling fantasy odyssey.  I was less thrilled with Suikoden 4, which was a step backward in technology with very flat characters and a plot that lacked the vastness of Suikoden 3.So here comes Suikoden 5 which, strangely enough, has been simplified to the point of almost being a throwback to a PSOne game, lacking event the graphic finesse of its predecessor, but which is every bit as interesting a game as Suikoden 3.  Once you get past the lack of fine detail, you can't help but notice that the artistic design itself is excellent.  The plot is intricate, and the fight system is solid without being overwhelming.  And it's a very big world with plenty to look at and interact with.If you haven't played a Suikoden game before, the underlying structure is political, and a good part of the game involves international and interpersonal relationships.  One of the keys to the games are the 108 stars - characters that must be found, recruited, and used during the fights and battles to come.  They must be trained, armed, and occasionally coddled in order to complete the game successfully.  You not only get to deal with the traditional hack and slash of traditional combat, you have to cope with a real time battle system.  When you're not doing that you can go on trading expeditions to make money.  And you will always need to make money.This otherwise successful game has two flaws from my point of view.  I found the tactical warfare system difficult to work with.  I seemed to be getting the job done, but I was never sure what it was that I was doing right.  Another irritant is the number of random fights encountered in fields and dungeons.  When you are in the middle of trying to figure out a puzzle or a maze, getting interrupted every three steps can get on your nerves.Over all, this was a game that far exceeded my initial impressions.  I contribute this to the complexity of many of the characters.  This kept up the flow of surprises that make a game interesting.  I'd play it again some day.", "\"First off, let me just say that I find negative reviews for this game completely laughable. The complaints I hear all seem to revolve around reading and waiting. Dear god say it aint so. I thought they made games for people who liked leveling up but hate reading and have no patience. Aren't they called God of War? Readers do not be put off by the negative things you have heard about this game but rather judge its merits on your own. Or better yet, my standards!  Wink!The storyline in this game runs deeper than almost any other I have ever seen in a game. At worst this game should warrant no less than a three, and this I say despite any personal taste, because you are expected to enjoy the genre you are reviewing otherwise you provide nothing useful, just as I would provide nothing useful if I reviewed a sports title. Some things are just good. Empire Strikes Back is just good. However, there is always someone who wants to be a contrarian, and then there are those with just plain awful taste. To those who can't handle this game's long build up, or as I like to call it \"\"Pacing\"\" (A concept few seem able to understand in our flash bang world today.)Perhaps you should master your adult onset ADD and give it another shot. Normally I would never criticize someone for their taste, but in this case it had to be said.This game is one that comes across every few years when the stars align (The real stars not the stars of destiny). It's not just a good RPG, it's not just a good game, it is just good! A quality piece of interactive media that creates an impression on those who can appreciate it! The tragedy of this game, and really the series in general is its puzzling lack of support and popularity despite its hardcore but small fan base. These games are very well made and fun to play, and yet they seem to be somewhat obscure in spite of this. If you are looking for a story that will give you that \"\"Oh my god Aeris noooooooo!\"\" feeling all over again, then this is the one.Plot and CharactersThe plot of this game is truly epic; so epic in fact, that there is nearly two hours of exposition involved before you begin to control your character, and can freely roam about. Is this a bit much? Yes, perhaps to some but I would argue that this set up is completely necessary. Suikoden games have always taken their time to get under way, but the pay off is a lushly fleshed out title, which makes you care about the characters, and what they are doing. The game sets its plot up not in a long winded way, but in a methodical careful way so that when the proverbial finally hits the fan, you are left drooling for more. You can expect all the same themes of intrigue, honor, betrayal, sacrifice, duty, and friendship that were present in the other games. I personally say this game is superior to the second title which is still considered the golden child of the series to many. I suspect a combination of nostalgia and rarity are all that places II above V, but that is not at all to say it is a bad game. They are both utterly fantastic in my eyes.You take on the role of a young prince in this game, who is caught up in the court intrigue and political maneuvering of his once prosperous kingdom. The game goes through great pains to introduce you to all the key players, rather than have them materialize in a big cape and say \"\"Ha ha ha I'm going to blow up the world!\"\" The characters, even the villains are complex, and you will really feel immersed in the court drama, and plotting that takes place in the game. I don't wish to give any more specifics for fear of spoiling the story, but after about 4 hours of ticking, this bomb explodes, and when it does you will not want to stop playing until you beat it.As for characters you are certain to find a few you like out of the 108 possible to recruit. This game has a long standing tradition of having the largest party both in battle and out of, for any RPG, and the large number is based around the story line itself. The 108 characters, including the main one correspond to the mystical 108 stars of destiny. Each person you bring on board has a special role to play, and recruiting them all makes up not only much of the content of the game but much of the fun as well. As in other games most characters won't throw their lot in with you until you perform a certain task. This aspect of the game requires much searching and backtracking to previously visited towns. You never know when a new face might show up. There are even a few reoccurring characters from other Suikoden games. If you have played through the others, and you should, you will be delighted to see these characters become playable once again.The main characters themselves are well designed, interesting and interact well with each other. So much of the story is conveyed through conversations between the main characters, and they are truly well crafted. This game is more reminiscent of a novel that was converted into a game in some ways. The characters personalities are replete with flaws, strengths and everything in between and even the \"\"bad guys\"\" of the game are extremely relatable.Game-play:Suikoden V does exactly what I want with a sequel to a beloved series of games. It preserves all the major elements of play, and adds in or combines a few extra bits as well. Unlike some series which feel the need to reinvent the wheel with each new title, (recent Final Fantasy offerings spring to mind) Suikoden has done a relatively good job of keeping its game mechanics integral. This game combines elements from previous games in a very effective way.There are three elements to the combat of the game. There is your basic 6 person party which constitutes most battles in the game. This is a fairly traditional turn based style of combat, but obviously having six characters instead of the typical three or four adds a new element to the flow. Then there is a one on one duel type battle, wherein you must preempt the actions of your opponent based on his or her words in order to effectively fight. Finally there are all out war segments, where members of your party lead units of soldiers, and act as generals. Each one requires a different type of strategy, and all are fun.Apart from this there are tons of mini games, and a nice customization element taken from Suikoden 3 and refined. The rune magic system offers a refreshing change from typical MP based magic in other games. The result is that you are able to cast magic less often, but it is far more powerful. I like this concept much more than the magic in other games which seems to have bright flashy graphics, but does barely more (or even less) damage than a melee attack from some spiky haired hotshot with a sword larger than his body.The game play overall is nice and solid. Nothing too difficult or too easy, and most of it revolves around strategy rather than button mashing or reflex. Moreover it is good because it offers that nostalgic experience to fans of the original two games. I am from the more traditional camp of RPG players, and it should be noted that I enjoy turn based strategy driven role playing games, much more than the more active type seen increasingly today. So if you started playing Role playing games recently you may find the slowness of this game off putting. I think it's minor and if you are invested for the right reasons you will hardly care about the combat system anyway. It may sound uppity but if you pass right over the wealth of great story and character interaction in this game and complain about the turn based battles, then you aren't a real RPG fan anyway in my book.Sound and GraphicsThe music in the Suikoden series is great! There is a very distinctly Asian sound to it but also a noticeable European influence. In fact the setting and graphics of the game are much the same. It's like a fusion of Japanese and European cultures, and it creates a subtle yet highly imaginative effect that is equal parts strange and appealing. The game is colorful, but not garish. Each character is rendered in a distinct fashion, and they have character portraits to show more detail. The cut scenes in the game are enjoyable, but perhaps a little awkward. There seems to be a lot of strange idiomatic hand waving that goes on for too long and other similar things. They aren't the best but they move the game along, and they aren't an unwelcome addition in any case.Graphically the game is not spectacular, but because of this more time could be spent making the game in depth in terms of plot, and it certainly has kept the game from being linear. Some titles have suffered for their primary emphasis on graphics, particularly in the PS2 area. This game looks good. It's not trying to be eyeball exploding. It doesn't want to be, or need to be. It's a classic styled game made specifically and unapologetically for fans of the series, and shows that this team of developers really understands what their fans want. Integrity!I'll wrap this up as it's already run a bit long. I can't say enough good things about this game. If you have played and enjoyed Suikoden I and or II then you must try this game. At the risk of sound sycophantic, it has it all. I am typically very harsh with games, as I have exacting standards for what I will call a good RPG, but I can scarcely think of a single negative comment about this game. I played once all the way through, and then literally restarted it and played through again before touching a single other game. I don't think there are any other games I can say that about.\"", "Look out Square/Enix!  Konami has really built this series from the ground up.
