"], "reviews": ["The thinkThin bar is not a snack bar, but is intended to replace a meal. It is sugar and gluten free, and is intended to carry you through a part of your day with a high protein jolt. The bar itself contains 240 calories (70 from fat), and has 24 grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of protein.The taste on the fudge thinkThin was OK, but not great. Also, the price per bar is a bit high. On the other hand, though, it was somewhat filling, and did do a good job of replacing my lunch - keeping me going though the afternoon.It's not a bad bar, having a decent taste and it does its job, but there are better bars out there.(Review of thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Bars)", "Rarely has a product offended my taste buds as much as this bar did. I'n definitely not going to stock up on these bars.", "\"I recently spent several months counting calories and monitoring everything I ate in an effort to lose some weight. Never in my life had I ever paid much attention to the actual calorie numbers in foods. I just looked at grams of fat. In the 90's that's what we were all told to do, watch fat grams. Of course now we know better. Calories do indeed matter. I spent a few months using the calorie deficit method (taking in less calories than I was burning daily) and lost about 30 lbs total. I found this worked better for me than going to the gym, since spending every day running on a treadmill just made me eat more! I've been back to eating normal for a few months now, and so far have maintained the weight loss. But I haven't forgotten what I learned during the time I was dieting, and now I check out exactly just how many calories are in the foods I'm eating.Just because something says \"\"thin\"\" on the label doesn't mean it's necessarily going to help you reach that goal. After trying this bar, I also read up on the calorie and fat numbers. Each one of these chocolate fudge bars has 240 calories and 8 grams of fat. To give you a comparison, a full size Butterfinger bar has 270 calories and 11 grams of fat. There are actually MORE calories in one of these chocolate fudge bars than in a large Butterfinger bar you can pick up at any gas station in the candy section. What these do have is a bunch of protein. So if you're just doing some basic dieting by cutting calories and trying to shed some pounds, this bar is not going to help you meet any calorie goals. If you're doing intense cardio workouts and need some protein to keep up your stamina, then these are for you. They obviously have some benefit over the empty calories of a candy bar. But for many of the popular diet programs that require you to watch calorie numbers, these bars have the same numbers as a typical candy bar.As for taste, this chocolate fudge is okay. People who only like real chocolate and dislike anything that isn't the real thing, will probably not find the taste all that appealing. For others who are more accepting to the taste of \"\"diet foods\"\", the taste/flavor is okay.For those people who prefer the taste of real chocolate, but are looking for something more healthy than candy bars, I'd suggest checking out the KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars. They have very similar calorie/fat/protein numbers as these thinkThin bars, but use real chocolate that can be loved by even the pickiest candy lovers.\"", "\"My mouth watered when I saw this fudge! I love fudge, so I had to have it.When it arrived I opened the bar immediately and took a bite. I was disappointed because it did not have that delicious chocolate flavor. It was too soft and doughy; tasted more like a Brownie to me. Darn...I don't have a gluten problem, but this might be more acceptable to someone who can't tolerate gluten.Sorry I can't be more positive...Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 10, 2013Author of \"\"Millennium Babe: The Prophecy\"\"\"", "\"Sure, this is a \"\"healthy\"\" chocolate bar, but man is it good.  It is a solid fudge candy bar with a smooth texture, not grainy or powdery like so many other protein-rich products.  It is also very filling:  I ate one at 11:00 am, replacing both breakfast and lunch and was not really hungry again until 4:00 pm.  Nice.Very chocolatey, easy to bite into, not like cardboard, good price.  Recommended.\"", "As others have posted, this bar is not anywhere near anything I would ever eat again.  While I use protein bars to supplement my appetite throughout a day, this one was as tasteless as I've come across.  Bland, blah and borderline nasty.", "\"ThinkThin Chocolate Fudge Gluten Free bars may very well be the worse bar that I have ever tasted. Think of everything that the words \"\"chocolate fudge\"\" create in your mind. This is none of those. It has a very strange texture as well. Total pass!\"", "These bars taste wonderful and have 20 grams of protein! The texture is soft and chewy, very fudge like. Excellent flavor and taste. My teenage boys have already eaten half the box and I have to order more....", "For something with no sugar and 20 grams of protein, these are actually pretty good tasting.  For something you can just grab and go, it is healthy and good tasting.", "\"Lucky me, I work in a place that frequently finds ways to deprive employees of an actual lunch break. Because I frequently have to eat \"\"lunch\"\" on the run, the thinkThin Chocolate Fudge bar is pretty darn good. I like the fact that it has some decent chocolate taste minus the sugar. For a diet bar, the texture is pretty much like a chewy candy bar. Add a cup of room-temperature coffee, and this is lunch!\"", "\"I've had quite a few of these bars in my bag as I travel - the Clif Protein bars are the top, with a couple of the Atkins varieties slightly below, and this one near the very bottom. They're sold under the auspices of healthy - that halo effect from the \"\"gluten free,\"\" but they're really just a not very good candy bar.Pros:- No sugar, so if you're low carb they'll work- Um, they're larger than some of the teeny tiny bars, so that's good.Cons:- They taste pretty terrible. Flavors of wet cardboard, stale beer, and old cigarette butts meld with that something you'll find on the floor at a fraternity house.- They're not good for you. Just eat a candy bar instead, seriously.\"", "This is a review for the Think Thin Crunch White Chocolate Mixed Nuts bar. Protein bars are usually not my thing but I like this one because it's mostly just nuts and (white) chocolate.Taste: I like nuts and chocolate, so I would like anything that's made of those two things and I really enjoyed the taste of this.Ingredients: 12g of fat but only 2.5g of that is unsaturated fat, still 13% of RDA. I'd expect most of that to come from the nuts. Zero artificial sweetener which I like. 4g fiber.Summary: One of the most natural protein bars I've come across. I like the taste. This is one of the few I'd buy.", "These are OK.  Not the best kind of protein (soy is inadequate to whey or other types) and not a whole bunch of it.  They taste good, but I have found better tasting bars for around 200 calories.  Not the highest quality ingredients either.  For this type of bar (meal replacement), I would recommend a Clif bar.  It tastes better, has higher quality ingredients, and leaves you feeling much fuller for a much longer period of time.", "\"These bars have an excellent flavor, and a smooth, chewy texture. They are very filling and satisfying. They are not sickeningly sweet, but they would make a good replacement for a dessert, if you are craving chocolate or other sweets. They would also make a decent meal-replacement bar.I am highly sensitive to sugar alcohol, and I would probably not have eaten one of these bars if I had checked the label before consuming it, because it contains malitol. If it were not for the sugar alcohol, I would definitely buy this product again. Unfortunately, within six hours of consuming one of these bars, I began getting predictable GI complaints.Another issue with malitol, for those who are concerned about carbs and/or calories in general, is that there is disagreement as to whether it truly is a \"\"zero calorie\"\" sweetener. Supposedly the body cannot digest sugar alcohol, so it passes through the GI tract without having an impact on the body nutritionally. However, some sources claim that the body can utilize about half of the 4 calories per gram that all carbohydrates contain, though sugar alcohol does not raise the blood sugar as much as other sugars.This bar is listed as having 240 calories and 20 grams of protein, making it qualify as a high-protein bar. It has 24 grams of carbs (1 gram of fiber, 12 grams of sugar alcohol). It has 8 grams of fat (no trans fats).This bar is certified as gluten free, but it does contain milk and soy products. Some people do not like to eat canola oil, which is the fat used in this product. The ingredient \"\"natural flavors\"\" is questionable, as well, for the health conscious. Information on that is included below.Ingredients: Protein blend (whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, calcium caseinate, casein) glycerin, malitol, coating (malitol, cocoa butter, chocolate, sodium caseinate, milk fat, soy lecithin, natural flavors, salt), almonds, water, canola oil, chocolate, alkalized cocoa, soy lecithin, natural flavors, sea salt. CONTAINS: MILK, ALMONDS, SOY. MANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT ALSO PROCESSES EGGS, TREE NUTS AND PEANUTS. GLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO, gfco.orgNatural flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: \"\"The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional\"\" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.\"", "\"The thinkThin Chocolate Fudge Bars don't offer much to stand out in the aisles of Snack/Meal Replacement bars found at the market these days.  They seem to be yet another product that has jumped on the \"\"Gluten Free\"\" band wagon which I find manipulating and off putting.They boast 0g Sugar and 20g Protein but have 240 calories per bar.  The taste is very bland and for me had an off flavor. I think if I want a jolt of protein with low calories for my afternoon pick-me-up I'll stick with a couple of hard boiled eggs.\"", "This review is for the Chocolate Fudge flavor of the Think Thin Bars.  In a word, yuck.  This bar may be all kinds of nutritious, but you have to want to eat it for that to take any effect.The taste and texture was kind of like eating cocoa powder dusted Styrofoam.  It was kind of chewy and soft all at the same time and the only flavor, aside from a dry flat taste, was the cocoa powder.  And it was more like a milk chocolate for the cocoa powder as it had that kind of sour aftertaste.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy it.The ingredients are decent.  The following is the ingredients list copied from Think Thin's website:PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN) GLYCERIN, MALTITOL, COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, CHOCOLATE, SODIUM CASEINATE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SALT), ALMONDS, WATER, CANOLA OIL, CHOCOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SEA SALT.You would think since it was real chocolate and cocoa butter that it would have been a bit better tasting, but all I can think is that perhaps they used low grade chocolate.  And I was really surprised to see almonds listed in there, I didn't taste them at all.  And using Maltitol for the sweetener, I would have preferred stevia or even just a tiny bit of cane sugar (yes I realize part of this products boast is having 0 grams of sugar, but a tiny bit wouldn't hurt).  Still, for a protein bar this isn't a bad list in comparison to other brands.This product is certified to be gluten free and it is sugar free unlike many bars out there.  So it is unique in that aspect and good for those on special diets.  There's 240 calories per bar, but this is meant to be a meal replacement or training snack, not a regular snack.  8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber are in it along with 20 grams of protein, which is a lot.  And while there is no sugar, sugar alcohol is present as 12 grams of this bar.I wouldn't buy these again.  At least not in this flavor.  Perhaps some of the others are a little better tasting.  But I couldn't even finish this bar I thought it tasted so bad, and I'm not normally one to waste food.  But, perhaps with different taste buds, someone could enjoy this enough to reap its nutritional benefits.Review by M. Reynard 2013", "Ideal for on the good. Individually wrapped and easy to carry. If you like chocolate, you will like this. It has a cake/brownie texture on the inside, with a chocolate coating.i really enjoyed the taste, and it left me satisfied. It is a very nice protein bar, enjoyable to eat. 20g of protein and 0g of sugar and gluten free.", "?!?  It's unfortunate that reviews of all the different ThinkThin bars have been corralled together.  Makes them less useful in my opinion.  But in any case, this is a review of the Chocolate Fudge bar.The bar is very brownie-like.  Dense and chewie.  It's covered with a nice chocolate that smells delish and tastes good.  Inside is a dense fudgey bar where the protein comes from almonds and soy.My personal readings of late have indicated that soy is not healthy, but I know most of my vegan friends would disagree.Not for those allergic to nuts, milk, or soy.  This bar is tasty and if you are looking for something to tote in your lunchbag, backpack, purse or pocket, you should check this out.Pam T~", "\"I had almost given up on trying power bars and protein snacks. We came across Larabars a while ago and decided we should stop there. They were soft, moist, chewy, but not leather-like and no chalky after-taste.I'm glad I gave these a shot. I am truly impressed with the overall flavor and texture of the bar. In fact, I let my kids take a taste and they ate the rest of it. The overall consensus was that it tasted like a brownie. I didn't bother to tell them it was a \"\"healthy\"\" snack. They just loved it.We not keep these kinds of snack bars in our glove box and diaper bag when we travel for family snack attacks. I would much rather give my kids one of these than drive through McD's.\"", "Just make sure this is your only food source, and i guarantee you'll start dropping pounds. Starvation is a more tempting option than letting these pass your lips.Because i'm a slow learner, i've tried two different flavors: chocolate fudge and chocolate covered strawberry. In both cases, for the first half second or so, i thought they might be decent. The first flicker of flavor is unoffensive. But then that vanishes and something dreadful replaces it. I can't even describe it.There's nothing redeeming in the texture either, something along the lines of fluffy damp sawdust.And lest you think i have a problem with all high-protein meal bars, i assure you, i'm a lazy person and often end up eating zing or clif or builder bars instead of tracking down an actual meal. Some are good, some are decent, some are not so good, but they're all better than these.", "I have tried my fair share of protein bars and they all seem to taste like powdery chalk.  This high protein bar by Think Thin is not an exception.  The flavor is chocolate fudge and while there is an element of chocolate it is mired with a bitter aftertaste that is prelude by powdery chalk aspect that haunts my palate.  This protein bar is designed to be a meal replacement, hence the calorie count of 240 and a total fat count of 8 grams.  I would imagine that if a person is willing to sacrifice the calories and fat, this meal replacement bar should taste better.  In addition, this protein bar has cholesterol in it, which I found quite disappointing.  There is no sugar or trans fat in this bar but cholesterol?  I believe I will continue using homemade smoothies as my meal replacement.", "If taste is one's first priority in selecting a protein bar, then one is likely to try any number of products before being satisfied. I thought this product is tasty. When I opened the package, there was a rich scent of chocolate. The bar is chewy, with the consistency of a dense brownie, and the chocolate coating did not seem over sweet to me, and I usually do not eat many sweet foods. I enjoy chocolate a great deal, however, and if I were craving chocolate, this bar would satisfy that craving. It does not have a rich, full chocolate flavor, however, in spite of its scent; expecting it to taste like just-baked food would be unrealistic, after all.This bar packs 240 calories, 70 of them from fat. Low in cholesterol (2%), sodium (8%), and fiber (4%), it packs 20 grams of protein. It has only 10% of the calcium and 8% of the iron needed in an average daily diet. It is gluten free but processed in a plant that also processes nuts.Consumers who are considering using this product as a meal replacement should take these nutritional issues under consideration. Those on a limited-calorie diet should consider how large a day's allotment goes to this single 2.1 ounce bar."], "Gamma": [0.07350611686706543, 0.0740494653582573, 0.06527876853942871,
