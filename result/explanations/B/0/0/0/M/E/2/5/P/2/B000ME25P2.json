They are:1. Missing Letters2. Split Decision3. Pasta Letters4. Block Letters5. Word Shuffle6. SafecrackerThese six games are varied and entertaining enough to become close to addicting. They are easy games to learn, and offer enough variety that the games don't feel as though they blend together.In regards to improving vocabulary. I am not to sure how much improvement there will really be, unless it is a child playing the game. The description says there are 17,000 words I only recall running into duplicate words a couple times. So there seems to be enough variety there as well.Some have complained about the difficulty for users who are left handed. I didn't find it to be a problem at all. That could very well be a personal thing though.Overall, I enjoyed this game and found it to be very addictive. I also like the daily score that you need to reach to advance to higher levels. It's a nice touch and encourages people to play. While it may not have the depth in number of words I would have liked. It held my interest and provided hours of entertainment. I recommend this game to the younger crowd, I am not sure how much benefits adults will get out of it aside from fun.", "\"I decided to give the Nintendo DS word coach a full week of playing (the recommended amount time for each day) prior to reviewing. What strikes me as interesting are those who say the game is too easy. During the first few days this is true, but the game becomes harder and some of the puzzles become \"\"difficult\"\". Some other reviewers have complained about the software's ability to identify the letter you draw with the actual letter - I have some issues, but nothing too major. I would guess that it identifies the letter correctly 90% of the time (and I have horrible penmanship)The question many parents and teachers may ask - does the game help you build a stronger vocabulary? My answer.... Probably. The game has a large variety of puzzles that require different levels of skills - some emphasize spelling, others word recognition, and yet others focus on strict word definition. After about 3 hours of total game time I feel that it would make a nice supplement, especially for middle schoolers.The game is fun for all ages but probably most helpful for those 10 and up. I wouldn't stick it in the fun/wow factor category of Super Mario Brothers, but anyone who enjoys word puzzles would definitely be intrigued by \"\"Word Coach\"\".Final verdictFun factor - 3.5 StarsEducation Factor - 4.5 StarsFinal Score - 4 Stars\"", "\"I have to knock off the 2 stars because there is not left handed option. There is a level/stage called \"\"Block letters\"\" Where the DS needs to be turned to it's side like playing \"\"Brain Age\"\" (1 & 2). And for a lefty like me, your arm overpowers the top screen and you can't really see anything so It becomes difficult to play. But since a lot of the levels/stages don't require you to turn your DS sideways, It's still 80% enjoyable.\"", "I love this program, I use it every day.  but I also got the iPhone version and I prefer that over DS, because I already carry the iPhone with me everywhere.  and the iPhone/iPod Touch version only costs $5.", "CON first: I can't help but start out this review by mentioning how needlessly long winded the explanations are, which aren't the least bit helpful or instructional.  Even in a live class, if the professor were to prattle on like this the audience would be lost out of boredom and wondering what motivated it.  Explain it in the book or on a website, not page after page on the tiny screen.But there is more on the positive side to say about this software than on the negative.PRO: This is not a game.  While it could be more engaging and enjoyable I have to say it's extremely well done and really does provide a quality evaluation, drilling, and learning experience.I do not agree that a mastery of word structure or a more sophisticated vocabulary makes for better communication, but in terms of linguistics this is far more than you could expect from a piece of software made for a handheld gaming device.  Praise goes to Nintendo of course for creating this subculture of handheld gaming as a learning device--and on the cheap--but the creators of this particular software deserve a lot of credit for the level and quality of the content here.BOTTOM LINE: While I wouldn't recommend this as fun or agree with the premise that better communication is a matter of greater vocabulary, this is a great piece of software for those who want to develop their ability to understand even unfamiliar words, where it's more about your ability to reckon an answer rather than know it.I love the fact that it teaches the student to think of the composition of words, because this is a valuable reasoning skill. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun way to digest this material, it doesn't make the grade.I recommend it for those serious about improving their linguistic abilities, but don't buy the idea that it will make you a better communicator and therefore do such magical things as increase your income or cause people to listen to what you have to say any moreso than they do currently as it seems to be claiming.I only take one star away overall simply because I don't agree with the hypothesis, but this is five star work.", "I like this game and it is a lot of fun. I have been playing for a week now and I feel that I improved my vocabulary slightly. I wish that they had an option where they actually said the word, because some of the words in the game I just cant say, so it would be nice to hear it. Also, it would have been nice if they used the words in a sentence so you actually see how it is used. Overall this is a good game game but if they added those options that I mentioned, it would make this a great game.", "\"I was very pleased with this game; it is certainly an enjoyable way to learn lots of new vocabulary.  Of course, on the other hand, it's a little distressing to realize how much I DON'T know!!  Nevertheless, an excellent tool for students or really anyone who wishes to expand their vocabulary.  As a writer, this reivewer finds the experience invaluable - kind of like forming your own thesaurus in your own mind!I only gave this FOUR stars on fun simply because it IS learning and sometimes the games can be a little difficult, especially when presented with several unknown words.  That IS a good thing, it gives an opportunity to learn these words.What is very nice is that immediately following each mini game, the words utilized in the mini game are presented again along with definitions.  Also, some of the same words will be used in subsequent games (especially those which the player \"\"missed\"\"); this is a wise thing to do in my opinion, what has one learned if the \"\"missed\"\" words are simply missed and the player simply goes on to new words?  This at least will help the player (hopefully) retain the new words, even the \"\"missed\"\" ones.I DO wish that the game gave the player a little more time on the falling block games - it's one of my favorites; however, I almost always get a time PENALTY.  Just a hint, to go a little faster, tap the down arrow and more letters will drop so you won't waste precious seconds waiting for the correct letter - you may have to use the bomb a few times but you won't get as much of a penalty.  The penalty does not really mean anything other than your pride...  You still get credit for correct answers.The handwriting recognition is certainly decent.  It misses a few but it is not bad and it seems to be getting better as it gets \"\"used\"\" to my manner of playing.A fine addition, fun for adults.  May be too difficult for youngsters under 10. They may be discouraged by lack of knowledge of many of the words.\"", "\"Although \"\"My Word Coach\"\" is not the kind of game most kids would appreciate receiving as a gift, as educational games go it is a pretty fun one.Pro:- Lots of mini-games, which are used for training but are also fun.- Players are given a choice of four coaches; the \"\"personalities\"\" differ enough that it should be easy for anyone to find a good one.- Crisp, clean graphical look.Con:- The game's initial player screening is not very precise. I'm a college graduate with a large vocabulary, and I got 100% correct on the minigames the program gave me to determine my starting placement. It still put me at 20%, \"\"primary school graduate.\"\" I have to wonder what it would have called me if I hadn't gotten 100%!- The handwriting recognition is not perfect; the program has repeatedly confused my \"\"D\"\" for an \"\"M\"\" (and I have very clear handwriting).- As a result of the first \"\"con\"\" above, I find the game too easy. The words it is giving me include things like \"\"juxtapose,\"\" \"\"jurisdiction,\"\" and \"\"overawe\"\" -- there hasn't been a single unfamiliar word so far.I'm sure the game will give me increasingly difficult words, and that if I stuck with it for a few weeks I would start learning new words from it; but I don't know if I have the patience to keep playing until I get to that point.Overall, this would be a good game for children, if they would play it. It's probably too basic to be of much use to adults who already have good vocabularies and are interested in improving them.\"", "I am not as enthusiastic as some other reviewers.  Yes, this game exposes me to words I am unfamiliar with.  The farther along I get, the higher the difficulty level, the more games I unlock.  Words I miss are put back in the queue and I eventually become familiar with the definitions.Some of the games involve speed, rather than knowledge of the correct word.  They may give the same amount of time to spell a long word as a short word, sometimes with not enough time even if I know the answer.  The cereal game, for example, where a definition is given and we have to spell the correct answer from the letters floating in the bowl.I am not sure of the purpose of the falling tiles game.  We have to find the words in order to knock out the tiles, which stack higher and higher.  We have to knock out the blocks so they don't reach the ceiling.  The only thing we learn in that game is recognition of words, but no definitions or anything; and again, it is mostly a game of speed.Some of the games have the risk of motion injury, as I found playing the safe cracker game, where players twist their wrists back and forth and click to pick out the letters of the word that fit the definition given.  My wrists and thumb were eventually very sore.  In that game, I felt a standard game controller would be nice.What I would really like is to hear a voice pronounce the word and see it used in a sentence.  It would be nice to see some of the games involve placing the correct word in a sentence to show true mastery.  In fact, I kept playing and playing hoping one of the new unlocked games would involve something like that.  My hopes were not realized.  I had unlocked everything and no sentences to be seen.I do like the fact that words we miss are presented repeatedly until they are mastered.  It doesn't hurt to be exposed to all the definitions of new words.  I would like them to take it a step further, because if I could hear the words in a sentence, it would help me use them correctly in my daily writing and speech.", "\"While not necessarily a game this vocabulary building software for your DS is more of a daily brain bulding diversion much like a Brain Age.After several weeks of playing this daily I have unlocked all the single player game modes and all of the available multi player modes.  The ability to choose which word lessons you engage in and the initial selection of which character will guide you through the game as your word coach are the only really individualized concepts at work here. However the games ability to determine your vocabulary level is fairly uncanny making it a unique experience for each player and skill level.The multiplayer word games are fun for more than one and the 15 to 30 mins you will get out of this on a daily basis make the \"\"game\"\" coated educational software go down smoothly.  The Wii and DS versions are virtually identical I would say go with the DS version as it has better controls for the writing and letter grabbing games this title offers.\"", "\"I tried playing this game as an adult and found that it was fairly pointless.  I would recommend it for kids age 9-15.  I think anyone older than that would get too easily bored with it.  It's definitely more fun than studying a dictionary or textbook, but not fun enough to hold onto your attention for very long, especially not the wayBrain Agedoes.  There are six games you can play to increase your vocabulary:1. Missing Letter - Screen displays an incomplete word and you must write in the missing letter.  I found this incredibly easy, especially since anyone with a decent vocabulary will have at least a good guess as to what letter is missing. I could see this being a decent game for younger kids, but it still seemed pretty easy and dull.2. Word Shuffle - You are given 4 words and 4 definitions and must match the correct one with each.  This is a much better game since it seems more useful, and some of the definitions can be tricky since they are similar.  My only complaint is that the interface on the DS is a little hard to get used to, and I think they could have done better on this one.  Maybe drawing a line to the correct definition?3. Pasta Letters - There is a bowl of soup filled with letters and a definition in the top screen.  You use letters in the bowl of soup to spell out a word that matches that definition.  This seemed pointless to me.  It would have been more efficient to have you just write out the word, but I guess the \"\"fun\"\" part is to wade around in the soup and find the letters.  I guess you have to have a balance of fun and education, and maybe this would appeal to kids, but it was just an extra step I didn't need.4. Safecracker - Almost the same as Pasta Letters, except you have a safe and have to move the dial around to spell out the word that matches the definition.5. Split Decision - Another variant of matching the word to the definition.  You can also match a definition to the word, but doing it this way is almost too easy.6. Block Letters - A chalkboard is presented with words on it and in the next screen, you must select the correct letters from a group to form those words.  The good part of this game is that the letter pool you use to spell out the words doesn't immediately contain all of the letters you will need, so you have to know in advance how to spell the word, and where to put the order of the letters.  Although this seems like a simple game, it is probably oneFinally, the game gives you a score when you're done to indicate how good your vocabulary is, just like Brain Age.  Ultimately, I think this is a decent game for kids, but I'm not sure how many will really stick with it.  It could be good for adults who have a weak vocabulary.  Where I think the game will really excel though, are with the foreign language editions such asMy Spanish CoachandMy French Coach\"", "\"No matter your status or current situation one thing remains certain - words are truly power.  The bigger your vocabulary the better your command of English.  Such mastery of your core communicative tongue will give you confidence as others will perceive you to be smarter as well as helping you to move further in life as  your ability to read faster and master difficult subject matter gives you that extra edge in the competitive game we all know as life.  Ubisoft's Nintendo DS game, \"\"My Word Coach,\"\" is a compelling edutainment title that promises to strengthen your vocabulary through a series of mini-games and exercises while keeping detailed track of your progress and development to fully tailor a curriculum of sorts for the user.If the concept of strengthening your linguistic skills through a simple series of games intrigues you then I hightly suggest you give this title a try.  While the graphics aren't the snazziest around the title does manage to deliver what it set out to do - to build up your vocabulary and mastery of the English language.  One thing to note though - only purchase/use this title of you have at minimum a High School level command of the English language.  This program is definitely tailored for  the average, native speaker of English and may be somewhat difficult for those who utilize English as a second language (but fear not, there are more appropriate software out there to help those who fit this category).\"", "My Word Coach for the Nintendo DS is an educational video game designed to teach new vocabulary words. I really wanted to like this game, but ultimately, it fell short of what I had hoped it would be.The most important thing to know when considering purchasing this game is that it probably will help to build your vocabulary, but only if you use it to the point where all the word games get old. In fact, in my experience with this game, I had to play on average twenty to thirty minutes just to reach my daily quota of words. The problem is that there are only about six games, which means that things get old fairly fast. Perhaps I am just not a very disciplined person, but I began to lose interest in the games after a few days, and by a couple of weeks, I stopped playing the game altogether.However, the games really can help you learn new words. When you start out, the game evaluates what level your vocabulary is at. Then it gradually introduces new words. I felt the balance was good between new words, words I already knew, and words that I was in the middle of learning. Also, the game has a dictionary feature included, so you can easily look up definitions to words.The games are fairly fun, but nothing super spectacular. Some games are more helpful, like the game where you write a letter in to complete a word matching a given definition, while other games are less helpful, like the falling blocks game that teaches you how to spell words rather than what they mean. I felt the handwriting recognition was fairly good.In conclusion, if you like educational video games and are a very disciplined, consistent person, this game might be able to help you learn new words. However, I think for most people this game will get old after only a few weeks or less, so you may want to reconsider purchasing this game.", "As an aspiring writer this game was certainly created with me in mind. I love words and nothing is more exciting then learning a new word and adding to my vocabulary on a regular basis. I normally seek out my word fix by reading an endless amount of books but thanks to this game I have another way to feed my need for words words words. Not only that but it does it in such a way that your not aware your learning words instead your playing a game with words. Making it fun as well as educational. Now granted this game isn't for everyone but if you are a word-aholic such as myself theirs no better way to spend your time then with this game on the DS Lite.", "\"Word Coach will appeal to fans of games such as Brain Age.  Those not interested in edutainment need not apply.  That said, Word Coach provides a reasonably friendly environment in which to expand one's vocabulary.  Mini-games are unlocked over time- each providing a different way to familiarize oneself with the words on offer.  Over time, your vocabulary \"\"level\"\" is tracked and increased within the game.The two problems/issues I found are these:1) the game will probably start you out at a far easier level than you want.  It tests you at the beginning of the game to assess your vocabulary level, but I felt that the words I was playing games with were far less complex than the ones I had identified in the initial test.2) You need to be dedicated and play often.  In fact, the game will even chide you for not playing for a week or two.  I ended up not playing the game after a while, but I'm pretty sure that there are people out there that would eat this up, as I'm admittedly not the type that loves the Brain Age games either.Aspiring wordsmiths will find much to enjoy, regardless of the game's faults.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06686952710151672, 0.05963307246565819, 0.04116518422961235, 0.05580027028918266, 0.08886908739805222, 0.049367573112249374, 0.08213601261377335, 0.04702531918883324, 0.08963663876056671, 0.057212162762880325, 0.11393123120069504, 0.0012951677199453115, 0.0773298367857933, 0.10543996840715408, 0.06428901106119156]]}
