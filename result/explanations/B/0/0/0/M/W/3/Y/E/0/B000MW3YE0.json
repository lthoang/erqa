This is a full service camera for dummies! The menus are easy to use and understand, the functions are easy to access and use and the design is really comfortable to hold. The view screen is the sharpest and largest (a full 3\"\") out of all the cameras I looked at before deciding on this one. Downloading is really simple and editing is fun. This camera is so enjoyable to use, I would suggest it for young people as well as us seniors. I would suggest, however, that you invest another few dollars and buy the screen protector because the screen shows smudges easily. It's just a clear plastic stick on that you can buy almost anywhere camera are sold. (The 'fish lady' also recommends getting this camera in blue..it's really pretty!)\"", "The Panasonic Lumix TZ3, a 7.2-megapixel digital camera featuring its 10x optical zoom (i.e., the equivalent of 28mm-280mm) and image stabilzation is an excellent value for the money. It's relatively compact and lightweight (though a bit bigger and heavier than some cameras with shorter zoom capabilities) and offers a wide range of shooting modes to make picture taking very easy and virtually error-free. And, most importantly, the quality of the digital images taken with the Panasonic Lumix Leica lens, is exceptional. I highly recommend the TZ3, especially if having a broad zoom range is important to you.", "\"This is a great camera if you like zoom and don't like high picture quality.  I bought this because of all the rave reviews, but I can't STAND the awful picture quality. I have tried every setting, and I can't circumvent the extreme noise reduction that dominates my pictures.  The only pics that are good are in daylight.  Nighttime pics - forget about it. Colors are washed out, everything looks fuzzy (not out of focus fuzzy, but extreme NOISE REDUCTION fuzzy), and looks like I've taken pictures with a 1.0 MP camera.Overall it's a decent camera, but certainly not worth the $$ in my opinion.  The new TZ5 is supposed to have corrected the extreme noise reduction issue when it gets released.  Google TZ3 noise reduction and you'll know what I'm talking about. It's ashame we've come so far with technology, and yet this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction as far as picture quality goes.The low level of detail, along with washed out colors in almost EVERY picture, makes this camera very frustrating for me to use.  A lot of professional reviews say that a lot of \"\"post processing\"\" is necessary (in Photoshop) to get good photos. Personally, I don't have time to tweak every single picture I take.  I want a camera that, given the right settings, takes good pictures the first time.  I had one (Sony DSC-P100) but unfortunately sold it to pay for this camera. I have huge buyer's remorse.It's a compact, high zoom camera which is a good feature.  The video quality is pretty good.  But I'm telling you, you won't be able to take a decent low light shot to save your life.  I'm very tech savvy, and if using this camera for a year didn't help me get better picture quality, you can bet the average consumer won't be able to figure it out either. My advice would be to buy from somewhere that has a good return policy so you can send it back when you realize how awful your pictures turn out.  My vacation in Mexico will forever look fuzzy and washed out because of this camera.\"", "Best price-quality EVER! I wish I knew it before, you won't regret.Sometimes It makes me have second thoughts about bringing my Nikon D80.SUPERB!", "\"Let me start with my credentials: I've been working for a major daily newspaper for 23 years. I've won various photo contests, from local and regional contests, to national and international contests such as NPPA, POY, as well as the National Baseball Hall of Fame (several times). I've literally traveled around the globe, covering news features and sports. So, please allow me to lend my own feedback on this camera, which I have owned for several months now. I've also started actively shooting with camcorders such as the Panasonic AG-HVX200 high-definition camcorder, and the Sony DCR-SR30 camcorder.I'm a proud TZ3 owner (purchasing it with my own funds), and I've been using Lumix cameras since I was issued a DMC-FZ20, at my request. (That camera taught me about versatility when I went to the Superdome and the Convention Center to cover the plight of the survivors of Hurricane Katrina, who struggled to survive the elements following the storm). I've also used the FZ30, and also own a TZ1, the older and less-impressive sibling to the TZ3. And I'd pick this camera, over even the Nikon D2Xs and D2Hs cameras, if I had only one camera to pack in order to cover any breaking news story as of the date of this writing. Why? Because the Lumix line of \"\"bridge\"\" cameras are the most versatile and quick-performing that I've experienced to date. With the pro SLRs, I'd need to carry lenses from a 17-35mm, 80-200mm, and 300mm lenses, to shoot images while all that glass is wrapped into the neat package of the TZ3. Yet the Nikons I own don't shoot video. The Sony camcorder shoots only 3 still images per recording session, which don't match the image quality of the TZ3. And the HVX200 is too bulky.The TZ3 is a great run-and-gun camera. At a heartbeat, I can switch over to video and shoot some decent footage at widescreen mode (my preference), which is widescreen, at 848 x 480 (better than most hybrid cameras, which tend to shoot only in 640x480. The TZ3 is such a low-profile camera that you can shoot very candid stills and video when you want to capture people at their most human moments.The body is so compact, I can do 3 very vital and exciting things: place it into tight spaces, shoot without attracting unwanted attention, and mount the camera on unusual items (most recently, a bass drum belonging to a high school student in a marching band, and it recorded video during the band's practice). I've also clamped it onto a wheel barrow and also placed it among stocked food in the refrigerator section. That yields such wide ranging perspectives that could hardly be accomplished with many other cameras and camcorders.I like keeping the ISO setting at the minimum of ISO 100 or 200, for the digital noise can yell loudly at higher ISO settings. Most recently, I shot a gorgeous image of a moody scene at midnight, with street lamps and the moon being the only light sources on a fog-filled street.Some drawbacks: I'm not satisfied with the way the camera captures images at the default setting because they seem too washed out. So I set the camera at 2/3rds stop under-exposure. It adds better tonal quality. And the audio quality lacks for the video. I wash the sound in some audio software to crank up the treble, and add some bass. It takes more time, but it helps bring back the muffled sound that gets recorded through a single hole on top of the camera.The TZ3 is so compact that I carry it with me almost everywhere at work and wherever I go, because in a heartbeat, something could happen. If so, I'd be prepared to document whatever happens. Think about it: on my days off, I'd NEVER carry my Nikon pro bodies. And so this is great for sticking in your pocket for day trips, extended vacations, or a family gathering. If you can just remember that you can capture a moment, just pull the TZ3 out, and within about 5 seconds, you can record what could be some cherished memories.\"", "Panasonic has put an extraordinary Leica zoom lens (28-280mm) with excellent optical image stabilization on an average 7 mega pixel camera body. The lens makes the camera very attractive for travel but somewhat larger and heavier than its competition. This is the essence of this new camera and the rest is just commentary.", "On paper this seems like a great camera; 28mm wide angle lens, 10x zoom range, image stabilization and a huge 3 inch LCD all packed into a very affordable well built pocket size package. I really wanted to love this camera, but after using the camera I really can't recommend it. Read on.I once owned a Panasonic FZ5 and took many outstanding pictures with it before I upgraded to a DSLR. I bought the TZ3 as an easy to carry alternative for those days when I wasn't up to lugging around my DSLR. The TZ3 only fills the bill in good outdoor light, or when using a flash about 8 - 10 feet away. The low light performance of the camera is dreadful and it even losses detail at ISO 100. This, I have read, is because of excessive noise reduction processing. The flash is very wimpy, which compounds the inability of the TZ3 to take pictures indoors at night. The image stabilization is a nice feature, but you quickly use it up, because the TZ3's small size makes it hard to hold steady. It might just be me, but I also find the camera misses focus a lot. The net result of all of the above is a lot of blurry pictures. This was a common complaint I noticed in the reviews here on Amazon, before I bought the TZ3 anyway, thinking these reviewers were just inexperienced. I now think the people who are rating this camera highly are the ones who are inexperienced.The colors produced by the camera are also a little under saturated for my taste, which is an easy adjustment on most cameras, but there is very little you can adjust on the TZ3. You can limit maximum ISO, which you definitely need to do. White balance is adjustable, but the auto white balance is one thing that does work pretty well on the TZ3. Exposure compensation is the only other manual control and it can be useful, as the TZ3 often wants to overexpose by a 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop.What can I say? After having great luck with the Panasonic FZ5 I was expecting this to be a slam dunk. Maybe I have become jaded after a couple years of seeing what a DSLR can produce, but my wife has a discontinued Cannon A620 that runs circles around the TZ3 in image quality.The best feature of this camera is the 28mm wide angle capability of its lens. This is a significant upgrade from the 35-36mm found on most digital cameras. The 10x zoom range found only on the TZ3 is certainly useful, but not at the price of image quality. I have returned the TZ3 and will look at one of the Canon models that offer a 28mm lens with a 3X or 4x zoom range. These Canon cameras are also truly pocket size, where as with the TZ3 is too heavy and thick to be something you want to have in your pocket all day long.", "\"Panasonic has quite a digital camera in the TZ3. There's not much missing from this camera - love the 28mm wide angle lens that zooms to 10X. The 3\"\" LCD screen has excellent IS/Image Stabilization. I have been looking for all the features in a fairly compact camera. Love the \"\"clicking\"\" sound produced when you push the shutter release button. This camera takes great pictures. Haven't tried the video mode as yet. Overall, this is really the best compact camera I've owned. It does so much in such a small format.\"", "\"If only the Lumix TZ3 had the instant reactions of a much more expensive Nikon or Canon DSLR, it would be the perfect pocket camera, a worthy successor to the Leica M3, M4 or M6. As it is, the TZ3 comes really close to being the perfect digital pocket camera.The lens is the biggest part of the story: 28mm - 280mm (35mm equivalent), a full 10x zoom that doesn't extend more than 2 inches from the body. The 28mm capability makes a huge difference. I just spent the weekend with my sweetheart and five of her sisters. From a few feet away, I could capture the whole group - a substantial change from using the 35mm equivalent focal length of most other cameras. At the telephoto end, the 280mm definitely doesn't have the reach of the 350mm of the TZ1. Too bad one can't have it all. By using a smaller portion of the sensor, you can create higher effective optical zoom extensions, with a commensurate loss of quality, though this is not as bad as with digital zoom.The 7.2 Megapixel sensor provides adequate image quality.While there are no explicit manual controls, you can get a great deal of flexibility from using the pre-determined \"\"scenes\"\" and the basic controls such as bracketing.The TZ1 had a physical lens cover which was always a pain to deal with. You had to take it off. It dangled from a string and unless restrained, could wind up in the photograph. The TZ3 has an automatic lens cover: hooray! It also has a 3\"\" display, which is great to work with. The brightness of the LCD can be adjusted to accomodate bright sunlight (works reasonably well) and unusual viewing angles (works quite well).The TZ3 is smaller than the TZ1 which is good and bad. It is lighter, which is good. The camera fits neatly into a pocket, which is better than good. The automatic lens cap is wonderful and I suggest a screen protector for the LCD. The ergonomics of the TZ3, however, suffer with the reduction in physical size. The swelling on the right-hand side, which created a nice, hefty handgrip on the TZ1 has been slimmed down in a major way. A little more concious thought is now required when grasping the camera. It is also possible, as this large handed user quickly learned, to inadvertently place a finger in front of the flash.In terms of responsiveness, the TZ3 seems to power on a little faster than the TZ1, but it still takes time. Shutter lag is reasonably short. But in an ideal world, shutter lag would be non-existent. If that were the case, the TZ3 would indeed be the best camera for street shooting since the Leica M6. The zoom is smooth, if a little slow. Autofocus at lower focal lengths is practically instantaneous in well lit situations and distressingly slow in poor lightings. At longer focal lengths, there does seem to be some hunting.The battery is rated for approximately 270 shots. You will not appear foolish if you always carry a spare or two. Flash photography appears to quickly drain the battery. Also be careful if you decide to use 4GB SDHC cards: not all built-in laptop card readers will accept them. You may need a USB adapter such as the one supplied with this card:Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card(SDSDB-4096, bulk) & BlueProton USB 2.0 Card Reader Writer (Blue).Overall, the TZ3 is a great little camera. Even if you have a Nikon or Canon DSLR, you'll find yourself carrying the TZ3 far more often than you might expect. For everyday occasions and ordinary travel photography, this is an almost perfect camera with an extreme zoom, small size, light weight and enough settings to cover most situations. It is not, to be sure, a Nikon or Canon DSLR, but it is more than adequate for most tasks. By the way, video quality (640 x 480 at 30fps) is excellent.A great piece of engineering by Panasonic.Jerry\"", "\"I have to get on the bandwagon here.  This is a superb little camera, definately five stars!  I also have the TZ1, which showed promise, but has  limitations. In my review of the TZ1, I noted it had lots of \"\"noise\"\" and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp.  I also wanted more manual controls.The TZ3 fixes and improves almost everything about the TZ1 and adds some new, very useful features.  The noise has been drastically reduced, the lens is better, the sensor is bigger, and the processor is not only faster, but produces better pictures.  The TZ3 adds a very handy \"\"function\"\" button - or I should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so \"\"most used\"\" settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several.The TZ3 keeps the Mega Optical Image Stabilization and adds Intelligent ISO, increases the sensitivity without adding noise,(I have not tried the 3200 setting yet.), increases the size of the viewing screen, etc., etc.The TZ3 is a \"\"well-rounded,\"\" and very capable camera.  There is simply no comparison between the TZ1 and the TZ3 as far as the quality of the pictures.  The TZ3 wins hands down.  In my opinion it also beats some big name, higher priced digicams - a couple of which I own - rather handily.Of course, the big selling point for the TZ3 is still the 10X lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera.  This lens is SHARP, and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results.While there are no manual controls, per se, the camera seems to do very well without them.  Pictures are sharp, exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet, but low light forrest shots were excellent), colors were accurate, appropriately saturated, and vivid (OK.  I like the vivid setting.), good contrast, etc.  There are a variety of AF settings, settable focal points, and focus modes.  There is also exposure compensation, and exposure bracketing available - and they work well!  The live histogram is a welcome bonus.  The TZ3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent, sharp results.  The TZ3 is very well speced out.One nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the TZ1.  It was  really not to inconvenient, but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake.  The TZ3 lens includes an built in lens cover.  Very welcome.I currently own five top flight digicams (including this one), and have owned about that many others, I am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results.  It is a quantum step forward.I also have a couple of quite nice, and fairly complete DSLR kits.  They are wonderful, and in a class by themselves, but when I want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10X, wide angle lens, or a back up for the DSLRs, the TZ3 is now my camera of choice.\"", "\"I tested this camera extensively.  For casual point-and-shooters, who print small prints, this camera is small, has a great zoom lens, and gives usable pictures.  For those like me, who like enlarging pictures, or cropping, this camera blurs details.  The Venus noise reduction system applies a blur to all images, greatly softening detail at high magnification.  At close magnification of test images, my old Canon S50 pocket digital camera provides much more crisp detail, while this Panasonic TZ3 blurs all the fine details in an image.  This was true in bright daylight, flash, at all ISO's, and was especially severe in low light.  After testing this, I returned it.If you want a casual point-and-shoot camera with a great zoom lens, this is a good choice.  If you are into semi-serious use of the images, you will find loss of detail unacceptable.UPDATE:  I've since discovered that all current \"\"ultracompact\"\" cameras have worse picture quality than the compact digital cameras of a few years ago.  Since people continue to buy tiny cameras, the camera makers are putting in much smaller CCD's than a few years ago.  So if you're like me and you have a compact digital camera that's a few years old, don't count on any of the current ultracompact models to do as good a job.\"", "This camera could have had it all. Panasonic packed more features into this camera than anyone could probably use. The lens is great, the zoom range is great, the amount of configurable features is great, and the movie mode is great. Unfortunately, I bought this camera to take pictures, and that is the one thing that isn't great.I get a new point-and-shoot camera about every 15 months. Early on, I stuck with Sony, then moved to Canon, which made the last three of my cameras. This was my first Panasonic, and I am not impressed. I took about 200 shots in and around my house and neighborhood. I used all the different settings and features, then went to look at the photos on my computer. From a distance, they look great. When you zoom in to 100% (so you see the actual resolution of the photo), the pictures are grainy, noisy, and blocky; even in bright light, even with the sensitivity turned way down.What good are all the bells & whistles when all the camera can give you is a lousy photo?(Note: I recognize that half of digital camera users don't care about image quality. Those people will love this camera, as the rest of the camera is great.)", "I owned the first generation DMC-TZ1. The DMC-TZ3 has some welcome improvements; wider angle, automatic lens cover, maybe 25% faster shot-to-shot. In particular, the wider angle is a really useful feature.The camera's strength is in its versatile, daylight shooting. It does best with lots of light. Indoors, the flash coverage is just ok. Shot-to-shot flash recycle time is sometimes a pokey 4 seconds. Digital picture noise is noticeable with lesser light.Setup Tips:1. Use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos.2. Use vivid mode as normal mode looks washed out.Update: 28-May-2007 The flimsy automatic lens cover has broken. I'm able to keep it stuck in the open position. Rather disappointing. The rest of the camera seems pretty durable though.Update: 12-Jun-2007 The automatic lens cover has somehow fully healed itself. Over the course of two weeks of frequent use, it began to progressively return to its proper open and closed positions.Update: 15-July-2007 The automatic lens cover has again failed. Unfortunately permanently. I've upgraded to a DMC-TZ5. It has the same lens cover mechanism -- fingers crossed.", "\"I've had my TZ3 since June, and as a casual photographer I'm very pleased with its ease of use and with the pictures I've taken with it.  But for the reason discussed below, this is not a camera you can just toss into your purse or backpack without a protective case on it.  That's why I'm giving it four stars.I chose this camera because of:-- the 28mm lens (which so far I haven't found on any other point and shoot digital camera - though there may be one out there somewhere),-- the 10x optical zoom,-- the big(!) 3-inch LCD display, and-- image stabilization.The TZ3 is a bit heavier and larger than my old Nikon Coolpix 7900, but these additional features make the small extra weight and size worth it to me.  I've taken it on trips to Wyoming and Peru, and have been pleased with the pictures I've come home with, from such a small and easy to carry camera.I'm glad I bought an extra battery, because I tend to use the camera intensively, taking lots of high-resolution pictures, which drains the battery faster than \"\"normal.\"\"  I'd rather carry an extra charged battery when out all day with the camera, than worry about getting stuck with a dead battery and no spare late in the day.  So far, that's not been a real problem since the batteries are still fairly new.The only major weak point I've found:  the built-in automatic plastic lens cover is flimsy!  The one on my first TZ3 quit working about 45 days after I'd bought it (fortunately I bought my camera from a retailer that let me exchange it for a new one).  This time I'm more careful about using the padded bag that came with my camera, instead of just dumping the camera unprotected into my purse.  That also protects the LCD from scratches.If Panasonic improves this camera with a better lens cover, it would in my opinion rate a five star review.\"", "I bought this camera as a replacement for my aging powershot. Ive had the camera for two months or so and I love it. I mainly use the camera for concerts and it does a wonderful job for the most part - it's not even comparable to my last camera. The zoom was the biggest selling point for me and it's been great at shows. With my last camera the videos I shot were always poor in sound quality, but this camera is ok with the heavy bass of rock shows. The camera isn't tiny by any means, but it doesn't attract attention and can fit in a purse easily.The only con I have noticed is that when I'm taking a picture of a band the camera will choose one person to focus in on and slightly blurs the rest. I'm sure this is user error and I have some setting wrong but I can't figure it out. I've gotten compliments on those pictures but personally it's driving me crazy.I haven't used the camera in any other settings but concerts, but so far it's everything I had hoped for! Easy to use and the battery lasts longer on a charge then I had expected.", "\"Shopped around quite a bit for my next camera and settled on the Panasonic Lumix with 10x zoom and I haven't been disappointed. Excellent picture quality, good interface (not perfect - sometimes hard to figure out exactly what \"\"mode\"\" will yield the best pictures), beautiful and large LCD (with high setting for outdoor viewing), and that fantastic 10x zoom that takes close-ups and long shots with equal aplomb.All the features work extremely well and I've been very impressed with outside, inside, low-light, flash and backlit pictures that I've taken (and I've taken about 400 to date). The battery life is very good, lasting about 200 pics from what I estimate. While it doesn't charge with USB (which would be ideal) or have a cradle, the charger is very small and light and easy to travel with. The features on the camera are mostly automatic, but many can be adjusted manually pretty quickly to adjust to the situation.I'm also impressed with the video, in particular the ability to take 16:9 format video (and still shots too) makes it a must-have for anyone with an HD TV. The video isn't quite HD, but it looks fantastic on the TV. The only downside is how much space the video takes (I assume because of the Quicktime format). Get a big memory card - at least 4GB if not 8GB if you plan on taking lots of video.Overall this camera offers a relatively compact size and is as easy to use as any point-n-shoot with some of the most necessary features of a DSLR. It isn't professional quality - but it's as close as you can get for the price and size as most consumers looking to take great pictures will need.\"", "Having used to the popular brands of cameras like the Canons and Sonys - I was used to use to using the camera in a particular way - try to adjust the aperture, shutter speed ...  I was disappointed when I first got this camera that it does not have too many controls and knobsWhen I started using it, I noticed that the Camera is so intelligently build that you do not need to be very complicated to use it.Just use it with very few settings and you get amazing picture quality - both on the print as well as on the computer.Pros:=====(1) Image stabilization - You need this feature in a digital camera, since digital cameras are so sensitivie to minor shake.  This camera (and the casios) is way ahead of other cameras to have image stabilization a part of the standard feature(2) Color reproduction - Of all the cameras I have used (sony, canon ...) (not comparing to SLRS, but only to point and shoot) - this one has the best color reproduction - not sure if it is due to the leica lens or the image receptor, but the color reproduction is ultra realistic(3) Usability - Simple to use - just turn the knob to Best shot and shoot.  If you want to go a bit deeeper, select the scene type as night/underwater/cloudy ... and shoot.  Either way you get amazing snaps(4) Zoom - One of the best zooms available in point and shoot cameras(5) Battery life - Excellent battery lifeCons(1) Slightly bulky - I wish if this camera was a little less bulkier(2) Cost - Seems slightly expensive, but if you compare to the cost of Leica camera, these are only 1/10th the price, so it is ok(3) No viewfinder - Usually it is ok, because even in bright sunlight you can see the LCD, but I wish if there was one"], "Gamma": [0.14748896658420563, 0.1474878489971161, 0.1474878489971161, 0.1150684505701065, 0.14748896658420563, 0.14748896658420563, 0.14748896658420563], "Beta": [[0.11348360031843185, 0.0002728649997152388, 0.012364589609205723, 0.0029420293867588043, 0.0040900311432778835, 0.0020579230040311813, 0.00025764264864847064, 0.008418772369623184, 0.0002656594442669302, 0.006643979344516993, 0.02898721769452095, 0.5923851728439331, 0.0029843526426702738, 0.00026459849323146045, 0.21367648243904114, 0.008250889368355274, 0.002654135460034013], [0.11348362267017365, 0.00027286511613056064, 0.012364594265818596, 0.0029420291539281607, 0.0040900325402617455, 0.002057923935353756, 0.00025764276506379247, 0.008418776094913483, 0.0002656595315784216, 0.006643978878855705, 0.0289872158318758, 0.5923851728439331, 0.002984355203807354, 0.0002645986096467823, 0.21367651224136353, 0.008250893093645573, 0.002654136624187231], [0.11348360031843185, 0.0002728649997152388, 0.012364589609205723, 0.0029420293867588043, 0.004090033005923033, 0.002057923935353756, 0.00025764264864847064, 0.008418777026236057, 0.0002656595315784216, 0.006643979344516993, 0.028987227007746696, 0.5923851728439331, 0.002984353806823492, 0.00026459849323146045, 0.21367648243904114, 0.008250889368355274, 0.002654135460034013], [0.1148471012711525, 0.0002859011001419276, 0.012573052197694778, 0.0030278826598078012, 0.00426497682929039, 0.002149788662791252, 0.00027010191115550697, 0.00876270979642868, 0.0002780861977953464, 0.006862575188279152, 0.02881748415529728, 0.5886504650115967, 0.0031074341386556625, 0.0002773911692202091, 0.21464577317237854, 0.008452184498310089, 0.0027270729187875986], [0.11348360031843185, 0.0002728649997152388, 0.012364589609205723, 0.0029420293867588043, 0.0040900311432778835, 0.0020579230040311813, 0.00025764264864847064, 0.008418772369623184, 0.0002656594442669302, 0.006643979344516993, 0.02898721769452095, 0.5923851728439331, 0.0029843526426702738, 0.00026459849323146045, 0.21367648243904114, 0.008250889368355274, 0.002654135460034013], [0.11348360031843185, 0.0002728649997152388, 0.012364589609205723, 0.0029420293867588043, 0.0040900311432778835, 0.0020579230040311813, 0.00025764264864847064, 0.008418772369623184, 0.0002656594442669302, 0.006643979344516993, 0.02898721769452095, 0.5923851728439331, 0.0029843526426702738, 0.00026459849323146045, 0.21367648243904114, 0.008250889368355274, 0.002654135460034013], [0.11348360031843185, 0.0002728649997152388, 0.012364589609205723, 0.0029420293867588043, 0.0040900311432778835, 0.0020579230040311813, 0.00025764264864847064, 0.008418772369623184, 0.0002656594442669302, 0.006643979344516993, 0.02898721769452095, 0.5923851728439331, 0.0029843526426702738, 0.00026459849323146045, 0.21367648243904114, 0.008250889368355274, 0.002654135460034013]]}
