"], "reviews": ["\"I have hair that does NOT like to hold a curl, and conventional curling methods (iron, regular hot rollers) don't work well for me -- or they work, but an hour later, my hair looks like I never did a thing to it!Well, the Remington rollers with the heated clips definitely give me a lasting curl! My hair after using them can only be dubbed \"\"Texas-sized.\"\" I thought maybe it would settle down a bit in an hour or two, but no ... it remained HUGE! So definitely believe the instructions when they tell you to only leave them in for a couple of minutes!I found the rollers easy to use, once I got the hang of putting them in without burning my fingers. They were somewhat heavy, but they aren't meant to be left in for long. (Incidentally, I think it's great that this set has so many rollers! I have really thick hair, and most sets have nowhere near enough for my hair.)The only problem I had was one other reviewers have mentioned -- that the clip left a slight \"\"crimp\"\" at the top of my hair afterward. I did have to touch those parts up slightly with a curling iron. It wasn't a huge deal, but it did keep this from being a fie-star product.\"", "\"I based my review in comparison with that set I have been using the Babyliss Pro Instant Heat 20 Roller Ceramic Hairsetter (Model: Babchv21).I love how quickly the rollers were ready to use (less than 2 minutes) and the convenient storage case the rollers sit in.  Since the roller clips are heated as well, the actual set of the curl is much better than ordinary hot rollers that use a wire clip or plastic clip.  Another bonus is that the rollers come in only two \"\"useful\"\" sizes instead of the normal 4 or 5 sizes that range from large to too tiny.  I have been using hot rollers for years and I like the concept and design of the Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter but it does have it's flaws for women with thick hair.  My hair is thick and coarse and since I had to use less hair for each roller so the clip would hold in place, I was only able to do half of my head with 20 rollers.  The curl did hold in place and there were no indention marks or lines from where the clip held the roller in place. The only flaw was that top portion of my hair was curly while the rest was flat.  In order to get the results I get from my other set, I would have to do two roller settings with this set.So with that said, the Remington H-2050 will work great with women with thin or normal hair but for anyone that has hair that is thick like mine, you might be better off looking for another brand or style.\"", "This is a set of twenty curlers which are slitted to sit on a heated metal rack inside the case. The top of the case, which lifts up is transparent. It's a pretty large unit.It takes just a minute and a half for all the curlers to be heated and ready to apply.Twelve of the curlers are large, the other eight are medium sized. There are no small sized curlers, which I would've liked but still produce a tighter curl when left on for the maximum ten minutes.Negative ions produce smooth,shiny curls.No need to worry about your hands and fingers, the parts which heat up are the inside of the slits and inside the clips. (where your hands won't be touching)I'm impressed with this curling system, which is quick and simple and pleasant and recommend it highly.", "Well, they aren't the most prettily packaged hot rollers I've ever owned but they do a great job. They take up a lot more counter space than the traditional vertically heated rollers do as each curler is heated on a horizontal bar. The case they come in is shaped like a small typewriter (remember those?) and takes up about the same amount of space. Since the case is taller on one end I think it would be hard to find a drawer large enough to shove it away in.They do their job as advertised though. My other rollers took at least 10 minutes to heat up, then had to be in my hair for about 20 minutes- and they didn't come with clips, I had to purchase those separately. These new curlers heat up in under two minutes- as long as you remember to flip the ON switch, very important- are easy to twist your hair into since the surface helps grab on to your locks. The heated clip isn't uncomfortably warm, and in just 5 minutes I had long wearing curls that bounced and stayed even on a rainy evening with my long, fine hair. I was impressed.One thing to remember: pay attention as you grab each curler! Because once those metal bars they warm up on are exposed you can easily burn yourself on them if you reach into the case blindly. Trust me. Oh, and as a side benefit there's a little cord keeper niche in the back of the case. Hope this helps you purchase the right rollers for you!", "\"Ok before I got this  read all the reviews on it. I was afraid to order it. I have sorta crazy hair thats different because Im what you called  \"\"mixed chick\"\". Theres even a hair product you can look up on Amazon now that will explain that if you dont know what that means lol. Anyway when this roller set came I looked at it.. plugged it in.. planned it on purpose for a night I wasnt' going anywhere in case things didn't go well. Well.. guess what. Things went great. This set rocks.. and Im gonna tell you why.. I tested it not only on my mixed chick hair but on my friends hair that is a real blonde with super straight unchemical touched hair. It totally made us both look good. I think the people that complain it leaves \"\"marks\"\" in their hair dont understand how to really DO thier hair. We had no \"\"marks\"\" in our hair.. wasn't even a issue. It really does curl fast.. if I had to say one bad thing I'd say.. well its a little tricky to grab those clips fast.. they are hot.. you have to work fast is the key. I wish they came with something on the clip so the clip wasn't so hot where your fingers touch... but in all fairness every hot roller set I've ever used you wind up working quickly if you have any sense because the end of the roller will sting your fingers. This is no different.. not worse. I think some people shouldnt' be able to write reviews because they dont even bother to figure out how the product really works. This set got a bad rap in reviews unfairly. Buy this with confidence. Your gonna look great. Hey if you get what they discribed as a mark in your hair.. just take your blow dryer after you secure your hair in a clip and smooth it out.. get over it... its not big deal.. dont blame it on the product. Im A.Zerkle. I approve this message. lol.\"", "\"I've used several similar products in the past and this curler set is easily the best.  The set includes the storage/heating case with storage for the cord, twenty rollers/clips (twelve 1 1/4\"\" and eight 1\"\") and instruction manual.The curlers begin to warm via a metal rack in the case within a minute or so of turning it on.  Within five minutes, they reach optimum temperature and achieve maximum effectiveness within ten minutes.The curlers are easy to handle because the parts that heat up are not on the outside, but are on the interior of the clip and on the slots along the side of the curlers.  The clips themselves are simple to use, easy to remove and put back in place once you roll up your hair in the curler.I've found that the rollers heat so well (quickly and evenly) rhat a curl will take to the hair in just a little while.  If you leave the rollers in for maybe a half hour at most, you get a nice curl that holds for the entire day and night.Of course, a lot depends on your hair type, so if you have long, fine hair you probably want to heat up the curlers for 10 minutes or so and leave them in for a good half hour or more.But you don't need to sleep with them in or anything like that.  You will see a curl in as little as five or ten minutes after wear.The product appears to be well designed and the case is not too big, about a foot wide and a little less deep than that, so storage is not a big deal.If you are in the market for heated curlers, this product works great and is a fantastic value.\"", "Okay, the truth is out: I'm an old school electric curler girl.  I need body and bounce in my stick straight hair, and there's nothing like electric curlers to give my hair some movement.  However, I'm always losing those stupid pins that come with the set, and the curlers' ridges can hurt.  No pain, no gain, right?  But that's why I'm head over heals -- er, curls -- for this set.  The curlers are soft, the clips attach directly to the curlers in the storage unit so you won't lose them, but most importantly, my hair looked great!I put the curlers all over my head, and took them out again as soon as I'd finished curling the strand.  So in what -- 90 seconds maybe? -- I had the soft wavy curls that I love.  Fast, easy, convenient.  Whoo-hoo!", "What can you say? This is a great product. It heats up quickly and evenly, the rollers hold the heat, they don't burn your hair, and the curl lasts a good while. I like the ceramic inserts in the clips. I thought they would be on the rollers themselves, which would probably be too much intense heat for the hair. Instead, there are 2 small inserts on the clips themselves. The rollers are soft felt-like material that doesn't tangle your hair. There is a nice distribution of sizes, including large rollers, which some brands skimp on. The large covered case with clear lid is appealing and sturdy. There is a slot in the rollers where they sit firmly on the heating element lengthwise. They do fall off and get all mixed up if you turn the case sideways or upside down - so just don't do that!", "This heated curler set is simple and it works wonderfully. Even if you are a beginner, this product is quite fun and easy to use. Its a very nice-looking set too, by the way.Once you turn on the switch, the set heats up very quickly. The velvet on the surface of the curlers coax the hair around the roll nicely and the clips grab without pulling, even if you are clumsy like me. I find that my curls hold beautifully after only 10 minutes and my hair looks shinier, and they last.The case itself is large, with a translucent plastic hinged lid that has no latch. At first I thought the clips felt hot but its managable. It heats up in less than two minutes so I would recommend that you do not leave it unattended for a long time while pre-heating to be safe. I think its a very well-made and fun set, and I would highy recommend it.", "The first thing I noticed when I took this set out of the box was how BIG the set is.  I own two other heated roller sets which use metal pins to hold the rollers in place.  Both those sets are about half the size of this set, so if you don't have a lot of storage space, I'd probably look at another set.  This takes up about 1/4 of the space in my under-sink cabinets in the bathroom.The set heats up quickly - faster than my other curler sets.  This was also my first set which had velvet-flocked rollers, which I very much preferred to the plain plastic type (tough to get the roll started sometimes) and the rubber type (which tends to snag my hair) that I have on my other two sets.  The material grabbed my hair and made it very easy to start a good roll without crunching up the ends.Having an on-off switch is also something that seems to be lacking on so many of my other curler sets, so that was a nice addition as well as having a nook in the back of the set to wrap up the cord so it's not bulky or in the way.What many may consider a downside to this set is the clamp-type clips that this set utilizes to hold the rollers into place.  The clamps have a metal interior which heats up and helps to create a nice curl, but they do not have teeth and do not hold the rollers exactly where you might want them. These clips also prevent you from being able to spray your hair while they sit in curls (something I like to do with my other sets for a light hold) since the clips cover your hair totally.  If not placed just right, the clips also leave a tell-tale crimp at the top of the curler placement which is a pain. There is NO way for you to hold a super tight roll with those clamps. You will not have Shirley Temple like locks after letting these rollers cool. Because I already own two sets which do very tight rolls, this was a pleasant alternative as it automatically gave very natural, soft waves instead of bouncy curls.Despite all these issues, I really liked this set.  I would definitely not make it my only hot curler set, but I would recommend it to someone who already has a hot curler set and might be looking for more natural-looking waves instead of tight bouncy curls.", "I love that this heated in 5 minutes and curls were ready in 10 minutes. Unfortunately with my thick hair below my chest these curls just did not hold and easy to burn your self. I used hair spray and they were beautiful but only lasted about and hour and half. **Burn hazard* Do not let child under 13 use these without adult supervision due to burning themselves. If you have fine shorter hair you will get better results as my friend did.", "The Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline provide beautiful curls that have staying power - used with the right hair products for your hair type.The roller heat up quickly, a must for those of us who always seem to be rushed in the mornings.  When I have time, I like to let the curlers cool in my hair, but even when I've had to take them out while still warm, I've found that the curler and heated clip has produced great curls very quickly.The curlers are set lengthwise on a heated bar in the base unit.  Because of this, the base is a bit larger than other models, but I really don't see a better way to design this since the clips are attached to the curlers to be heated simultaneously with the rollers.My only complaint with the Remington H-2050 is that it crimps my style in the worst place.  While the heated clips provide the advantage of a quick set, I can't seem to keep the one in the front area above my bangs from putting a crimp just above the root of that section of hair.  Just where I want height the most, the clip ruins it.  I've tried a number of things to prevent this, but simply haven't found a good way to keep this from happening yet.  And to be honest, if I have to work so hard to rig a way to prevent this from happening, I can't in good conscience rate these rollers more than a 3.  It is a shame, because if that one problem didn't exist, these would be a 5-star roller set for me.", "I was concerned because some reviewers remarked about the impression left in their hair by these Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter rollers.  That was not the case for me.  Removing the case from the box, I was surprised at the size of the case, but then, there was little space wasted on any outer edge since the rollers are housed on metal rods, abutting one another and packed very tightly.  Two sizes are included and neither is huge.  I think it's a rather average sized roller, not like the juice cans which were used in the '60's.  The cord is well hidden in the rear of the case, there is an easy to identify On/Off switch, and the dusty pink of the clips and roller ends is lovely.  It's a solid package that looks good.Directions state that these heat in 90 seconds and they do.  It says your hair can be curled in 5 minutes and it can.  I had no problem with ridges, but am really careful in placement.  I also figured that the metal interior of the rollers would be hot, so I DID NOT TOUCH the metal parts.All in all, I think this is a really nice set and expect it will not need servicing before the 4 year warranty expires.  I'd recommend it too those who have a head of hair longer than a few inches.", "UPDATE: My wife wanted me to revise the review to note that she was wrong about the curlers being too small for her long hair.  Now that she has used these a while she still thinks the clip handles are slightly too small but she likes the variety of sizes and still maintains that these ceramic curlers work faster and better.As the guy who waits for her to get her hair done and is put in the position of judging the ultimate results so we can get out the door on time, I can attest to the fact that her curls look much better and are more durable when using these ceramic curlers (what the hell has marriage turned me into that I think of these things?!)Good stuff.  Rather decent Christmas gift I imagine.-------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:In considering this product you should know that the rollers and clips are successively smaller towards the back.  However, even the largest of the rollers is apparrently too small for my wife's long hair, and the they are also stiffer than her Conair rollers.  She also complained about the handles to open each clip are too tiny even for her child size hands (she's 5' tall and only about 100 lbs).However the ceramic rollers with ceramic clip combination do a far better job of curling her hair, and faster to boot--which I, as her husband who is typically waiting by the door while she gets ready, very much appreciate.BOTTOM LINE: I predict that she'll try these at least a few more times and either prefer them or dump 'em.  Overall, they're far better rollers than the ones she already had, but she has an issue primarily with their small size and ill-conceived clip handle design.", "Normally my hair does not take a curl no matter what product or tools I use. This hair setter set, along with some product, actually set my hair! My hair set in about 7 minutes. I had nice full, bouncy waves that lasted the entire day. The curlers heat up quickly, and are easy to use (even for someone who doesn't use curlers more than once a year). Great product!", "When I recieved this item, I was a little nervous about using it. But, as part of my obligation for getting it is reviewing it, I had to give it a try. When I tried to find the cord for it, I was a little confused because it was nowhere to be found. After investigating further, I found it in the back, tucked neatly away. I found this to be a great plus!Tucking this item in an unused drawer or sitting it in a permanent place on your counter is easy since you don't have to worry about the cord dropping into the sink or becoming tangled with anything else.Using this item is a little tricky. After plugging it in, I found another great detail. As I was waiting for them to heat up, I figured it would take the same amount of time as my curling item because this was basically a set of curling irons in a box. Now, on average, my curling iron take anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes to heat up but ninety seconds after plugging these in, they were ready to go. This is great for those days when you are crunched for time.While the clips get hot instead of the curlers themself (like older versions), the outside of the clip only heats up slightly. I didn't burn myself once while using this.The best part? The rods come in three different sizes so you can get differentiating sizes that look natural and stay all day (a little hairspray or gel required).All in all, I love this item!", "The clips have a hard time holding onto my hair.  I have very fine hair and these clips aren't tight enough to hold it.  The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on.  I also don't care for the lines left in my hair from the plates on the clips.  I want my hair curled, not crimped!This thing is big, too.  Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom and I find it teetering off the edge, very dangerous, especially with the exposed hot metal.I did like that these heated up fast and I will continue to use them, but only leave them in a couple minutes before the crimp lines start to set in.  I also like the flocked roller.  I just wish they'd had the whole clip covered with the plate so it wouldn't leave the lines in my hair and I wish they'd find a way to make a smaller unit.", "This is a fantastic set of hot rollers if you are looking for long, loose curls that are quick and easy to set.The soft velvet flocking on the rollers made it so easy to curl my hair around the rollers tightly. The rollers themselves heated up very quickly. Although they only take 90 seconds to heat up, I found I had a better curl when heating them up for five minutes before rolling. The clips helped to keep the heat in while securely holding the rollers.I prefer a tighter curl so I hope that Remington comes out with a smaller set of these since I prefer these to any other set of rollers I've ever used.", "The Remington T Studio Collection hot rollers impressed me. The unit is larger than most sets I have used and seen (and I have owned dozens of these things), so make sure you have a space to put this in.  I actually like the larger size and feel it looks professional.The rollers are a pretty rose color.  A roller fits atop the heating element, and a clip places over it during heating and storage.  This should eliminate lost clips, which has always been a problem for me.  I love the grip on the clips, and had no problem keeping the curlers on my hair with the clips on.20 rollers in two sizes is just right for me.  A 90-second heat-up time is outstanding.  I also appreciate the fact that the heating unit has an on/off button right in front.  That means you can leave the unit plugged in and just turn it on and off as needed.The cord storage is great.  So as you can see, I like many things about these hot rollers.  But the coolest thing of all, to me, is the heated clips.  That's something I haven't seen before.  I find it to be a nice feature.Overall, I am pleased and would recommend this purchase to anyone in need of a hot roller set.", "I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn't impress me.  I will qualify this by saying that I have exceptionally long hair that is difficult to curl.  Even with the length and texture of my hair, however, I can usually get a decent curl that last as least a couple of hours.  With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes.  I was really disappointed.  Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution.  (It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)", "I love this!  Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST!  My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up.  I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time.  This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them.  My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all.  The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter.  It takes up a bit more space than I have free.  So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug.  No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.", "I've never been a big fan of curlers, so it took a little practice for me to an optimum result from these. It was worth it!These curlers heat up quick - just a couple of minutes. They are very gentle. My usually frizzy hair comes out in beautiful curls that last for hours. The curls were very soft and natural looking - which is very hard to do as my hair is long and thick and typically very frizzy.Unlike other reviewers, I had no issues with crimping. I was very happy with the results. My hair is naturally thick and wavy though, maybe this is a problem with straight thin hair?I did not burn my fingers eithers. Of course, I was careful where I grabbed the rollers at. You would not grab the hot part of your curling iron either.There are a lot of curlers in this set. It was good to have enough curlers to do all of my hair. One reason why I usually don't use curlers is that I would typically need 2 sets. With this set, there were enough rollers for all of my hair. Yes, the footprint is huge, but I keep it in the cabinet when not in use. The nice box shape is easy to store.This is a five star set!", "I've been using electric curlers over 30 years and these are best improvement yet.So nice not to have to search for right size clip, they are right on roller.  Really goodselection of sizes and amount of rollers so can do whole head at once.  Nice set up.Heat up fast.", "\"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned.  It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product.  It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair.  This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair.  It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out.  It also will leave a \"\"crease\"\" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on.  No way to avoid it.  I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me.  Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.\"", "I was quite doubtful at getting nice curls from this as I have been so disappointed with other brands.  I was very wrong in my assumption.  I have stick straight hair and the curlers from this gave me wonderfully beautiful curls that lasted quite a bit longer than I could have possibly hoped for.  The curlers are a bit on the warm side when handling but other than that I am more than satisfied.  I would recommend this for any of you out there that long for curls and have been let down from so many other devises.  A great product that will pay for itself in no time.  A+++ in my book for something that I will treasure for quite some time to come.
