It connected easily and functions well.  My laptop keyboard drank a beer, so we started using this with the laptop.  My laptop had no bluetooth, but the included software and dongle were also easy to install and worked within minutes.  The keyboard is styled great, and the buttons are among the best feeling of any keyboard I have used.  The button are easy to customize, and the volume controller worked with out changing anything.  The round scroll wheels took awhile to get used to but is better that the standard square ones.  I would only change one thing - the touch pad could be slightly larger.  The battery life is extremly long on this keyboard, we only charge it overnight every few weeks. Overall this is a great keyboard, and i would reccomend it to anyone.", "I just got this keyboard delivered the other day.  Well worth the money i spent on it.  Installing the keyboard took literally 10 seconds, plugged the bluetooth dongle in and hit the sync button, didnt have to do anything else.  The touch pad works great, its not over sensitive or anything.  Im still trying to figure out what some of the buttons do but i guess ill have to read the manual for that part.  The battery life seems really good.. i took it out of the box, didnt charge it and it lasted all night for me.The only thing i would change on the keyboard if anything would be to have a backlight for all the keys, everything else is great..  all of the special function keys light up tho when you hit the FN button.  The left and right click under the touch pad are a little awkward to me but it might have to do with the fact tho that i'm left handed.  There is a left click button on the left side of the keyboard which is great.Logitech has always made high quality products, and this keyboard is just another great example of their craftsmanship.UPDATE:Ive had this keyboard for 3 years now, still love it! battery still lasts as long as when i got it.", "\"I did all my research for this product and it was basically, but not fully, what I expected it to be. When you take it out the box, the first thing you'll notice is how slim and sleek it is. I've been using it for a little over  a month so far and I've only charged it up once. I used this keyboard every day for a few hours a day. I usually turn on my computer in the morning and leave it on until when I get back in the afternoon or night. The batteries are amazing. It only takes about 2 hours for a complete charge; 15 mins if you want to use for 1 day. The charger itself is a nice little stand for the keyboard; really a nice thing to have and show off your computer setup if you have people over. The keys are not as spaced out as a regular keyboard [but they are regular sized... as least that's what it seems to me], but I didn't have a problem switching over from my other one. The Tab, Caps locks, and Shift keys on the left side of the keyboard are smaller than a regular keyboard, so you might hit them a lot when you're first using it. The keys are very smooth when you're typing. For gaming, I tested this keyboard playing CS [Counter Strike], I didn't really notice a huge difference in delay, but there is a very very small delay, in my opinion, however this may be due to lag on my part. I will have to continue testing it because I barely game anymore and that was only a 1 time test. No one every wrote a review for this product on ghosting, so I will be the first to do so. Ghosting [pressing a few keys at once and having the keyboard register all the keys] is decent on this keyboard. While playing CS, I was able to do a couple things at once [jump around the corner or far jump, while changing weapons, etc.]. I believe I was able to have the keyboard register up to 4-5 keys. Message me if you want to know more about it. This keyboard wasn't really meant for gaming because it's so slim and looks kinda fragile. If you're a hardcore gamer, I would suggest something else because if you abuse/pound on this keyboard, it will break. There are, however, options for gaming in the software it came with, like locking the windows key, etc. As you know, there's no number pad. I didn't really seem to miss it that well except when I want to use the calculator program or use the shortcut for character maps [alt + #]. The shortcut for character maps need the number pad in order to do it. I'm still trying to figure out a way to do it without the number pad. This keyboard can also be used for your PS3 if you have one. The F1-12 keys have macros; you can program them as shortcuts to different programs or website, commands, etc. However, to use the function keys you have to press and hold the Fn key that's located on the bottom right corner in between the alt and ctrl. There's no Fn key on the left side of the keyboard... a little of an inconvienence, but no big deal. The volume scroll pad is a little too sensitive. Unlike the touch/mousepad it doesn't recognize your finger [say if your sleeve of your shirt accidentally glazed over the volume, it will change it... the touchpad however only works when it's your finger]. I also felt that for a keyboard this costly, it should have a backlight option. It's a little difficult to use if you're in a pitch dark room. The software that it came in is decent, it lets you change the function keys, the mouse speed, keyboard options, and lets you see the battery life, etc. The battery life that it shows is not accurate. When it's on full charge it'll say 43 days for me, but it will stay like that for a few days before dropping to 38, then maybe a day later it will go back up to 40. I found that a little annoying. When your batteries are low, the battery light on the keyboard will flash red, and it'll have a little popup screen on the lower right corner of your monitor telling you it's low. You can also turn off the keyboard when you're done using it to save power... leaving  it on doesn't have a huge impact on it when it comes to power tho. When I first used this keyboard, there were a few problems with it like when I press a key, it'll register as another key [ex. press \"\"?\"\" register and comes out on screen as \"\".\"\"] This only happened once. There were also a bunch of things that happened once and never again. There are NEW updates for the keyboard... originally when you press the caps lock, the keyboard will make a beep noise, which is really annoying, the new updates will allow you to lock it so it doesn't work. The new updates improved the keyboard a lot. YOU WILL notice when dust particles land on the keyboard and when there are fingerprints. It does come with a cleaning cloth, but you'll realize you can't keep cleaning it forever. I, personally, have kinda greesy fingers, but it wasn't a huge problem for me. I don't think this keyboard is worth what it is. I got it for $155 with a $45 rebate. Everything seems pretty good, except I thought Logitech could of made it a bit better and have better quality control. This keyboard is basically in a way a laptop keyboard. If the price was lower, I would of gave it a 5 star. Message me if you want to know more about this keyboard.\"", "works great; sleek, slim, sharp design; extremely long battery life; sometimes i would be nice if there was a number pad but for the most part i don't miss it.now if there was only 1 receiver that worked with all of logitech's wireless devices... this is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.", "\"I tried a cheaper model before getting the diNovo Edge, and I just wasted money and time (although maybe my experience helped me find peace with the diNovo's hefty price tag).This is everything you would expect a wireless HTPC keyboard to be. The most important feature relative to its competition is the usable pointing device; it functions like a laptop's touchpad.It is the perfect input device for our Windows 7 Media Center connected to our 52\"\" TV.\"", "This is the best keyboard I have bought to date, and I have has this for 2 years.  I was looking for a keyboard similar to a laptop.  Short keystrokes and slim profile.  The battery life is beyond imagination - the rechargeable batteries last for months on a single charge and the charger is slick looking, keeps the keyboard up off the desk to give you extra room, and charges quickly.I would really like to see the same keyboard with a number pad and backlit keys.I also have the diNovo mini keyboard for my home theater.  The keys light up and the keypad works well.  The touch pad is horrible and there is no getting used to operating it smoothly.  The similar touchpad on the diNovo Edge works great.", "\"If I were going to use this as a primary PC keyboard, I'd rate it lower...  I much prefer a \"\"full keyboard\"\" when working (as I am now).  But that's not what I'm using it for, and I don't really think that's what the \"\"target usage\"\" ever was.This keyboard is PERFECTLY suited for the living room, and the \"\"Home Theater PC\"\" application role.  It's small, stylish, and has more than enough range to work from a TV tray or coffee table across the room from my HTPC (which is hooked up to my big-screen flat-panel through my receiver).Most of the time, when using the HTPC, I don't even use a keyboard (or mouse).  I just use the remote control, almost entirely from within \"\"Media Center.\"\"  However, when ripping music, or configuring software, or updating Windows, or on those rare situations when I want to do \"\"normal computing\"\" in the living room, this does it all.The \"\"touch disk\"\" is FAR superior to the conventional touchpad, as far as I'm concerned, if for no other reason than that it's NOT WHERE I'LL ACCIDENTALLY BUMP IT (which is why, on my laptop, I've permanently disabled the touchpad and instead us a handheld trackball).  The charge capacity is terrific (I've let it go for several weeks without a charge and never seen even a hint of signal loss).The only issue I've ever had was with a neighbor who, apparently, bought one of these for herself and kept \"\"channel hopping\"\" to the same channel I was on.  A brief \"\"teaching moment\"\" with her and I was able to get her to set it to a particular \"\"channel\"\" and then ensure that mine was on a different one.  If you have difficulties... check into that, first.  If there are multiple devices in the same place, using similar technologies, trying to use the same channel... you'll frequently lose your connection and have to turn the device on and off to reconnect.  Frustration, but easily fixed by a little consideration between neighbors!*****************************EDIT:I find that I must edit my review, as I've just discovered a tremendous flaw in this device, as well as the solution to that defect.The Logitech DiNovo Edge is a fantastic piece of design work, and the design team who developed it should be proud of their efforts.  But someone, at some point, forced them to compromise their design (no doubt supporting this argument with a \"\"business case\"\" involving selling replacement units after a couple of years!)The DiNovo Edge has pretty straightforward construction.  If it were not for the presence of a heavy, bright-orange adhesive-backed panel on the rear of the unit, the assembly and disassembly of the unit would be extremely simple.  Further, reviewing the existing molded parts, you can tell that the engineers who created this design fully intended for there to be a battery access panel.The problem with this device is that it uses a Lithium-Ion film-based battery module.  These units provide great power, initially, but INEVITABLY will fail.A failed battery can easily be detected by the following symptoms.1)  Reduced charge duration2)  Swelling of the battery pack (its center is at the top of the palm-rest, directly underneath the left-side \"\"alt\"\" and \"\"windows\"\" keys).  You can easily detect this swollen region.  Battery packs swell when the chemistry inside starts to decompose.  The main GAS product is oxygen...  which is why lithium-ion battery failures often result in very hot fires which can't be extinguished (and are often referred to, in accurately, as \"\"battery explosions\"\"...  a more accurate term is \"\"extreme thermal events\"\")3)  The on-board software identifying the failure and indicating it through an \"\"undocumented\"\" flashing LED pattern...  three red flashes, one green flash, then repeat..  on the charge indicator of the keyboard.If you have seen ANY of these, you'll likely see the others in short order.  This is a clear indicator that the internal battery has failed.  Continued use is not practical, and in fact the battery has become a potential fire hazard as well.The trick is to remove that ugly orange vinyl backing sheet (the adhesive will soften if heated... I recommend putting the keyboard outside in the sun on a hot, sunny day, and the adhesive will become quite easy to manage.Once this is done, you can see where the battery is (there's a \"\"window\"\" in the plastic backplane.You can also see eighteen of the nineteen screws which hold the two halves together.  (The nineteenth is under one of the two labels near the charger terminals).  Remove the screws, carefully pop the two halves apart, and you can see the battery.The battery is not soldered in, so it can just be popped right out and replaced.  There are numerous sources of battery replacements...  this is not anything \"\"custom\"\" so find one of the same size and rating and it will work just fine.  Several are available right here on Amazon, including one which comes with extensive instructions and a tool.Put the new battery in, snap the two housing halves back together, reinstall the screws...  and you've got your keyboard back, fully functional (be sure to fully charge it, of course).  If you really like that God-ugly orange backing, re-heat it (again, I recommend the \"\"bright sunny day outdoors\"\" approach) and re-stick it.  Myself, I always found the orange mat to be incredibly ugly (my one major stylistic complaint about the device) so leaving it off seems a better choice as far as I'm concerned!Realize, if you do this, you'll have voided your warranty, so be sure that it's out of warranty (if it's still in-warranty, Logitech will repair or replace it for you instead).  I have two, one of which is still in-warranty and one of which is out of warranty.I really do love this keyboard, and it's clear that the engineering team who developed it did a great job.  It's also clear that some idiot manager smacked them down, and likely hard, for making the device so that the battery would be able to be replaced, and insisted on a redesign to make the battery as hard to access as possible (short of redesigning the entire unit from scratch.  I'm sure that this \"\"manager\"\" got a big bonus as a result of \"\"increasing revenue by forcing replacement instead of repair.\"\"  Trust me, I've seen this in real life...But ALL LITHIUM ION BATTERY PACKS BEHAVE IN THIS WAY.  ALL FAIL, AND WHEN THEY FAIL THEY BECOME FIRE HAZARDS.  It's inevitable.  It is UNSAFE to have non-removable devices with this sort of battery in it.  In fact, it's also unsafe to simply throw away these batteries, as they can result in \"\"dumpster fires\"\" or \"\"garbage truck fires\"\" or even \"\"landfill fires\"\"...  and they often do.Lithium ion battery technology is NOT YET READY FOR TREATMENT AS A PERMANENT SOLUTION.  They're the best, by far, for energy density, but their life is not good, they become hazardous at end-of-life, and they need very special treatment for disposal (something we don't have any infrastructure to support).This will inevitably change, as new chemistry work is done.  But for now... I think I'm going to refuse to buy any future devices with non-removable Li-Ion battery systems.  If the battery can't be easily removed/replaced... I will not buy the product, no matter how good it is.And neither should any of you.\"", "\"It was easy t install and configure. It seems very well built, too. The key layout takes a little getting used to and the mouse...err...trackpad is, well, \"\"interesting\"\".Not sure how I like the rather large DEL key and the layout of that area of the keyboard but I will likely get used to it soon.Key action feels smooth and responsive. Having no real problems typing pretty fast right out of the gate on it.I do miss the number pad because, as a geek, I use Alt-248 a lot when describing the temperatures of my computer gear and I cannot seem to get the degree symbol to work using the normal 0-9 row...I got this keyboard to replace a Microsoft Laser 5000 wireless and I already like the feel better. I can sit on the couch and lay it on my leg and type just fine while looking at the monitor which is something I had problems doing on the microsoft unit becuase it would lose signal at nearly any angle other than flat and level.I like the ability to recharge this in the cradle, which was a feature present in the keyboard I had before the Microsoft. Coincidentally, that keyboard was also a Logitech.I am giving it 5 stars because I am more impressed with the typing action the more I use it.\"", "My last keyboard was a diNovo multimedia keyboard, numeric pad and mouse combo. It was a very good board but not made to the same caliber as this one.In construction this one is really second to none. Some have said there were some fit problems but my board arrived in perfect order. It looks and feels substantial. This board will not slide around on your desk. Where you put it is where it will stay.Setup was a breeze and typying is pure pleasure. The key resistance is perfect not to light as to give no feedback and not to heavy as to make your fingers fatigue. Logitech must have done a lot of research on this board and on it primary typing function and it shows. I have never typed on a more perfect board.Orange lights light keys when they are pressed. In my opinion this is more gimmick than anything else. But it is cute for the first day or so when you are using the board. The board is lightly programmable which is frustrating. Functions like single key strokes to bring up My Computer or My Document folder have been eliminated and in their place are four programmable Function Keys. I can live with that but it would have been nice if I could place these programmed keys as a default instead of constantly having to press the FN shift key and then the appropriate Function Key to get the response I want. Probably this only bugs me since I am used to their previous diNovo model which had a toggle for this default.One thing that bears mentioning is the Touchdisc. It is a pad that takes over your cursor control and it is fabulous. It has eliminates constant mouse usuage and keeps your hands on the board. Why Logitech doesn't make more noise regarding this little gem is beyond me.Another thing is the aluminum fronted palm rest. Perfectly designed with the right slant to support your hands and keep them in the right position for typing. The added benefit is that it almost always remains cool to the touch which, and this might sound touchy feely, soothes your hands. If I were Logitech I might have called it the strip the palm spa. OK maybe I wouldn't have but it sure feels good.The board is solid and performs impeccably.Worth every penny.Note: Since writing this review I have gone onto the Logitech forum which does mention an erratic volume control on this keyboard. It is being postulated that it may be ambient light, interference from speakers or monitors or a bad charging station that may be the cause. I have not experienced the problem yet however if you are thinking about this board you may be well advised to check the Logitech forum before purchase.The volume control and TouchDisc can be disabled using the Function Lock key and Off combination however that is not a solution for a board that costs this much.", "For [...] bucks I would expect a number pad.  The keyboard is nice looking, the keys are comfortable and it is over all very stylish but not worth the asking price.", "\"This keyboard is being used in a conference room along with a bluetooth mouse. The keyboard by far has stolen the show. People love it, they even don't mind using the touchpad to mouse around if it means never taking their hands off the keyboard.Sleek, smooth and definitely has that \"\"cool\"\" factor for execs. Battery life is great, 5 minute charge last all day, 24 hour charge lasts all month. Yeah its expensive for a keyboard, but completely worth it if you have to have a bluetooth keyboard.\"", "\"I should probably confess up front that I have become totally accustomed to keyboards in the Dell Inspiron line because of the light action and short key travel. I'm also quite fond of the touch-tying keyboards that I used heavily in the late 1980s and 1990s, although these types of keyboards are extremely rare and nearly impossible to find today.Instead, manufacturers like Microsoft, Logitech, and others have used cheap, clumsy key switch mechanisms with a single pole and center-loaded spring to house the key cap that are ill suited for hours of use by touch typists.The biggest problem with these keyboards is that the cheap plastic key switch is directly centered under the key cap and lack adequate balance so the keys must be pressed straight down from the center of the key cap. If your finger moves even slightly off center or moves at a slight angle, the weight of the key press increases dramatically and may make it nearly impossible to activate the key switch.The long travel and heavy weight required to activate the key switch exacerbates the problem and usually results in hand fatigue after a few hours of use.Yes, I am extremely finicky (and opinionated) when it comes to keyboards.To me, the Logitech diNovo Edge keyboard feels nearly perfect. The keys have a relatively short travel and are easily pressed from just about any angle without requiring a lot of weight thanks to the scissor action between the key switch and the key cap. This scissor action allows the keys to have nearly the same action when pressed in the center, along the edges, or anywhere in between. This makes it easy to touch type for hours without feeling any significant fatigue in my hands and wrists.The Logitech diNovo Edge is nearly perfect. Although it is true the keyboards lacks the context menu key (or what some refer to as the \"\"right click key\"\"), I found this to be less of a problem than I initially anticipated. I use the context menu key a lot in Visual Studio (perhaps even too much), so I assigned shortcut keys to the most used items in the context menu. For those items used less often, I use the right mouse button provided right on the keyboard.The keyboard itself feels very solid as if it is made of one piece of material and I like the round mouse pad on the Logitech diNovo Edge much better than the Synaptics touch pad provided on the Dell Inspiron... but I have to say I despise the Synaptics touch pad because it rubs my finger raw whereas the Logitech diNovo Edge touch pad has somewhat of a textured feel that results in less friction. Even so, I don't recommend using the touch pad for extended periods because even it results in some amount of friction->heat transfer to the finger over time.Overall, I think this one of the best keyboards I have used in the past 10 years as far as keyboards go. I use the touch pad occasionally as a light-duty mouse and I really like the touch-sensitive \"\"slider\"\" to adjust the speaker volume.I haven't really found much use for the specialized keys, though. I experimented with the magnification keys and immediately decided those keys are... well... less than desirable. Instead of actually magnifying a portion of the screen as I had expected, it seems to adjust the DPI setting in Windows in a funky way... that is, text and icons increase or decrease in size as if changing from 96 to 120 DPI but I couldn't find a way to return to the default setting.\"", "Who spend 150-200 for a keyboard, I do.  I came across this keyboard when I was looking for a media/couch keyboard (kb) for my PS3.  I ended up getting the Logitech MX5000 and returning it for a Versapomt RF Wireless Keyboard.  I then broke down and got this for my new computer.  So I have tried many wireless keyboard lately.The goods:+This is the only Bluetooth that I found that is rechargeable.  Most other wireless kb use battery, which is bad for the environment.  The recharge indicator on your computer indicated it will last for 42 days, maybe.+The design is simply modern with oranges light-up and touch sensitive inputs like the PS3.  Also very sturdy for sitting on your lap in front of the TV set.  This is design as a media keyboard for a nice AV system.+The circle touch sensitive mouse is a little frustrating, but is surprisingly one of the better one out there, similar to the laptop touch pad.  Versapoint touch pad is the worst and BTC 9019 wireless is the best like a console joystick. (I returned this since it often loose connection with the PS3)+Yes, it is compatible with PS3 Bluetooth after update 1.6. without plugging the Bluetooth 2.0 dongle.  Too bad you can not use it both at the same time with your computer and PS3.  You most sync it to one device at a time, but the option to switch is there.+QuietThe bad:-The price for design and technology is rough.  200 would be ridiculous but 150 or less is somewhat reasonable.-Yes as other have mentioned it use laptop's keyboard and touch pad technologies, but high quality laptop's technologies.-No number pad, but I don't use it that much, making it smaller.-If you don't mine throwing batteries away, there are cheaper RF and Bluetooth wireless options: Apple~60 (no touch pad), Versapoint~90, BTC~40 and Logitech PS3~80.-frustrating input at timesOnly buy this for your media system, since it is the coolest keyboard out there.

This upgrade was mainly for it's elegance of design and simplicity.  The key \"\"feel\"\" is perfect as others have testified to, making typing feel precise.  The slim profile is very elegant and it is not cluttered with unnecessary buttons that will not be used.  I like having the mouse pad which although used infrequently, still it is convenient at times.  I love the fact that I can charge it in the stand which eliminates desk clutter while it is charging.  Apple has been the leader in industrial design in it's products for a long time.  Logitech is one of the companies that \"\"gets\"\" it also.

Most keyboards with glossy black/acrylic materials look very cheap, however this keyboard reeks of luxury. The lights on the keyboard (orange!) are fantastic, and the multimedia functions on the side are great, which would make the keyboard useful for a media PC hooked up to the TV or projector.My girlfriend is using this keyboard right now and enjoys it.

Aside from the price being exorbitant, this is a great keyboard to say &#34;Hey look at me, I'm fancy.&#34;", "First, this really is an Amazon verified purchase; we put it through my husband's separate Amazon account.  This keyboard is fairly unique in that it has a built in touch pad, very rare to find in wireless keyboards but something my husband had to have.  That said, it loses a star because the touch pad is off to the right.  It should be centered to make it easier to use for either left- or right-handed persons.  The other main reason my husband wanted this keyboard is that it weighs less than a pound; he will be recovering from surgery for several weeks, and this will be on his lap for internet access through a TV in the bedroom.  More later on how the keyboard performs over time; in the meantime, he has tested the keyboard, and the action of the keys is solid.  We have owned several Logitech products, all demonstrating quality and excellence.The installation is very easy via a disc, and it connects through a Bluetooth device.  There are not many of wireless keyboards available; a comparable one at Fry's sells for $225, so this purchase represented a saving of 30 percent over that one.

The trackdisc is horrible, especially if you are trying to any type of productivity work. Get a mouse, it will make your life so much easier. It is great for web browsing, movies and music. I love the keyboard though, I am typing on it right now. Very convenient and comfortable in your lap if sitting on the bed or the coach. It is priced really high for a keyboard and the trackdisc is not worth it. It is however, sleek, sexy and very functional, if that is what you are looking for.PS: I was experiencing some connection problems, and I see that other people have experienced the same thing. If you have your Bluetooth receiver around any wireless products, i.e. routers, wireless PCI cards. The Bluetooth will have interference with the wireless products around. Don't know why.

The first keyboard I received had intermittent bluetooth issues, so I got it replaced under warranty.  A year or so later that keyboard developed battery issues, where it would only run for a day or less between charges.  To Logitech's credit, they did send replacement keyboards under warranty.  A buddy who has the same keyboard noted that he finds it doesn't charge every time you put it in the charger... sometimes you have to insert it several times before it actually starts charging.  So I'm wondering if my battery issues were maybe charging issues.  At any rate, the three year warranty makes these reliability issues less painful, but I still don't like having to send it back so often.", "\"I have used laptops all my life, but because I do a lot of photo editing, I recently had to buy a more powerful desktop system. However, there was one thing I was not willing to give up, and that was the comfort of working with the keyboard resting on my lap and with NO mouse. I looked around at several other solutions, mostly from Sony, but none appealed to me, technically as well as aesthetically, more than the Logitech diNovo.Because I am a cautious person I needed to try it out first, that's the reason why I ended up not buying it online, preferring to pay some more for the right to return it at a brick and mortar store.It was so easy to install and configure (on XP, I am having a few issues installing it on Vista right now: I find it works best on Vista WITHOUT installing the software, you barely loose some configuration settings but at least you don't mess up your PC) that it took me about 5 minutes from the time I started unpacking to the moment I was up and running -and then I had to charge it before I could start playing with it-.The installation CD is extremely well designed and you are guided through all the few necessary steps: this stage takes you about a minute, after which the keyboard is already operative. I used the supplied bluetooth dongle, but the manual says that if your computer already has bluetooth, you can venture to configure your bluetooth connection through Windows. From past experiences with the windows bluetooth utility, I have my doubts about the outcome: when trying to configure a bluetooth connection on a laptop running XP to work with Skype, I had to eventually uninstall the Windows bluetooth utility and replace it with the Widcomm one! I recommend keeping both bluetooth devices separate, the Logitech one working exclusively with the keyboard.Next you configure your settings, like scrolling speed, pointer acceleration and the likes, all very quick and easy. Here I have to make my only negative observation about this product: you cannot disable tapping, so if you are not used to it you'll have to learn to be gentle when using the touchpad, which by the way is as good as any I have had on a laptop. There is a second left-click button on the left side of the keyboard, so you can keep your right index on the touchpad and click with your left index: very handy once you get used to it.You can configure a lot special keys to perform actions like opening a browser, running the media player of your choice etc., there are even three keys dedicated to zooming.Volume control is achieved through a touch sensitive part of the glossy black plexiglass surrounding the keyboard itself: very neat!When you are not using the keyboard, it gets in a stand-by mode; simply caress the touchpad to get it operative again.Battery life is amazing: I have had my diNovo for a week and the battery meter in the system tray stil says \"\"good\"\". When you need to recharge, just drop -not literally, though- the keyboard on its stylish black cradle and that's it.So, to sum up my long review I give the diNovo wireless keyboard with built-in touchpad two thumbs up.And yes, like another reviewer said previously, fingerprints do show on both the shiny black plexi and the satin-brushed metal, but cleening the diNovo will be the only work this amazing product will give you.\"", "Nice looking product, looks like it smudges very easily though.  I am a tech and surprised at what a pain the setup is.  I will update this review once I start using the product.  For now, first impression is that this is worth half what I paid.", "I bought this keyboard for use with my laptop, which I use while sitting on the sofa. Putting the laptop on my lap was hurting my back because it make me hunch over to look down at the monitor. So I bought a laptop stand, thinking that would solve my problem. But the laptop stand was too unsteady to type on, so I raised the height of the laptop stand to eye level, bought a lap board for a keyboard and bought a different Logitech wireless keyboard. This way, I could type with the keyboard on my lap, which is great as far as ergonomics go. That worked well but the wireless mouse that came with the keyboard kept falling onto the floor when I would put the board down. So I bought the Dinovo Edge because it has a trackpad and I wouldn't have to worry about a mouse.THE GOOD1. Stylish design. The best looking keyboard I've ever seen.2. Great feel.3. Connectivity great.4. Using the trackpad wasn't a problem.THE BAD1. The touchpad scrolling feature doesn't work well and isn't worth using.2, Too expensive.THE UGLYAfter using this keyboad for a couple of months, I noticed that the charge was lasting for progressively shorter lengths of time. I've had this keyboard for 6 months. When I went to use it this morning, there was no charge left, even though I charged it overnight two nights ago. I called Logitech and they're going to replace it (although they're making me pay for shipping it back, which is probably going to cost me about $8 through FedEx). Oh yeah, and they say it's going to take two weeks after I send the old one back before I'll get the replacement.********************NEW ADDED INFORMATIONIt's now just under two years since I received the replacement keyboard. The left mouse button has become really difficult to click--I have to apply a lot of pressure. I've taken to tapping the pad instead.In effect, this is a disposable keyboard that will only last a couple of years. I would replace it with another one but I can't afford to.", "This claimed to be Bluetooth device. But there were no instruction of how to connect keyboard to other bluetooth dongle or connect other bluetooth devices to Logitech dongle.There is no different of having a RF keyboard but much more expensive. It's definitely a don't buy.", "this keyboard looks sexy and that's just about it. it's way overpriced even with all its features and built in track pad. get a real mechanical keyboard like the razer black widow for half as much if you're a typist or a gamer. your fingers will thank you afterwards", "I've been having the same problems that other people on the forums are seeing: the charging light flashes red, and doesn't do any charging.  The suggestions about cleaning the contacts or re-positioning on the charging stand didn't work.My unit is out of warranty, so it's a total loss for me.", "\"(Edit: See end of review for PS3 info.)Primary use: Gaming, surfing the net.Everyone spends a fortune on thier computer and many spend a fortune on thier monitor.  Even fewer buy themselves a good mouse.  Pretty much nobody buys a good keyboard.  Sadly your primary interface with the computer is your keyboard...should it really be the ugly redheaded stepchild of the family?Bad stuff: No numpad and logitechs subpar software (Edit: Software isn't needed so not really a bad thing.  Running it without any software/drivers)First off, I have the previous dinovo set sitting on another desk so I had already made the leap to spending a fortune on a keyboard. (Edit: For anyone that has a previous dinovo set, this one is worlds beyond the originals.  Added feature is it responds near instantly instead of taking 15 to 30 seconds to come out of sleep mode, sucks having to go get coffee for your keyboard)Once you bite the bullet and decide you want a good keyboard the price of the dinovo edge seems a little more reasonable and the quality is excellent.It's a logitech and I swear by thier interface devices.  The only company that rivals logitech in the world of interface devices is microsoft and I don't think microsoft comes very close.I grabbed mine when they were first released.  I'm guessing that was about 6 months ago.  I've had to charge it twice since then.  Average usage is between 4 and 6 hours weekdays and 16 hours weekends.  (Edit: Been a month or two since I wrote this review and I had to charge it the other day)The biggest thing about this keyboard is how it looks.  If you don't like the way it looks then you should stop looking at it and move on to a keyboard you think looks better. (Edit: Good luck finding that)Keys are laptop style, I'd say better than laptop.  Take your average laptop keys and think about what you'd improve on them and thats the dinovo edge.  Smoother keys, a little more resistance, and a slightly longer travel distance, plus its full size.The little touch volume controller works fairly well, not perfect but it doesn't matter.  Chances are you have a set of speakers that you will control the volume with as opposed to using the windows settings.The touchpad....well it's a touchpad and I assume you have a mouse.  Completely useless except for when you are bored.  If you were to use this keyboard to control a multimedia box as opposed to a typical desktop machine, it's got everything you will need in one sturdy little flat thing that will probalby make your coffee table look much sexier.One thing that is a bit odd and I've not found it detremental is thier treatment of the cluster of keys to the right of the main keyboard.  Namely the insert, pgup, pgdn, home, etc. keys.  The delete button is much large and easier to hit since it's the most commonly used key over there.  There is no pause/break button so if you need that then don't look at this keyboard.  Home, End, Pgup, and pgdn have been shifted around to compensate the delete key forming two vertical rows instead of two horizontal rows.I mentioned the horrible logitech software but since this is a nuts and bolts keyboard the software has little to do with it and amazingly it synched up and worked flawlessly.  Wish I could say the same about the previous dinovo.ConclusionI: If you don't need the numpad, do need a slick wireless keyboard, and it's in your price range...order now (Edit: really can't beat the ~$150 price.  I paid $300 to logitech back when it came out).  Match it up with a G7 mouse and you'll love your computer all over again.PS3: Syncs with the PS3 no problems at all.  Only tested with XMB but don't know what else you would use a keyboard with.  Perhaps home (will try to remember to \"\"beta test\"\" that eventually).  Touchpad works great for mouse and keyboard works fine.  Haven't figured out a PS button, start or select button yet but those aren't so important since your sixaxis is probably sitting right next to you anyway.  As far as controls in the XMB: Esc, Enter and the Right touchpad button function as X,O, and triangle.  Sure can't say it's flimsy.  Been debating on the logitech mediaboard but reviews saying its flimsy have kept me from ordering.  Now that I know the edge works...no mediaboard for me.And it really does look sexy on the coffee table.Conclusion II:  For the PC I say get it, refer to conclusion1.  A second reason to buy it is the fact that it syncs nearly instantly to both the PS3 and PC.  Have your PC dongle in an easily accesible location and carry the board between the living room and office depending on where you are working/playing.  Two for the price of one and its only like $150 right now.  Must buy.I will be either picking up a second one or carrying mine between rooms from now on.\"", "Great addition for a hometheater PC. Product functions just as advertised with good connectivity and long battery life.The keyboard back light really helps in low light situations.The charging stand makes for an easy place to store the keyboard while not in use and makes remembering to charge the keyboard easy.", "It's small, light, thin, and the rechargable battery is great.  Of the keyboards out there with an integrated touchpad, this one is clearly one of the best.  The scrolling function on the touchpad is especially well implemented.  The only button I wish it did have was a dedicated button to bring up Windows Media Center.  Oh, the software lacks some features / options to that I think should be standard, especially if you use it with other Logitech bluetooth devices.", "\"With keyboards costing as little as $10 these days, it is quite interesting that Logitech would market a $200 device. When first considering this purchase, I began to wonder if consumers were merely running out of computer accessories to buy and needed an outlet by acquiring superfluous peripherals. Yet, I was willing to take a chance as I spend 10+ hours per day in front of a computer. For me, any productivity enhancement is worth the investment. And that is exactly what I got with the diNovo Edge.Like most users, I have grown accustomed to notebook keyboards as their keys have a much smaller travel than those on desktop keyboards. For me, I am simply able to type faster. The shallow keys were initially what attracted me to the diNovo Edge. As such, I have been very happy with the keyboard's feel. Moreover, it is probably the fastest desktop keyboard I have ever used.Another feature of importance is its Bluetooth connectivity. My notebook has integrated Bluetooth, making setup in the morning a rather brief activity. Nine of ten times, my Dell XPS notebook recognized the keyboard without a hitch. In fact, even the initial setup was relatively easy. However, I would recommend *NOT* using the CD included as Logitech has made several revisions to the Setpoint software. Download the latest version from the Logitech web site. Even if you don't care about the additional features, Logitech tech support will always tell you to install the latest version of the software if they can't figure out what is wrong with your setup.This leads to one of my biggest irritations with my user experience. When pressing the Caps Lock key there is beep. Disengaging the Caps Lock key creates another beep with a different tone. The Setpoint software has a setting to toggle this audible alert on or off. However, it doesn't work with this particular keyboard. After installing and uninstalling different versions of Setpoint four times, I contacted Logitech tech support. What was really irritating is the representative wanted me to reinstall it again in safe mode. I finally gave up when someone on the Logitech user forum, who appeared to be an employee, said that the toggle did not work - for now.There are some other shortcomings with the diNovo Edge that the buyer should be cognizant of before purchase. Most obviously, it lacks a number pad. This can be issue for some users. As I am accustomed to notebook keyboards, this isn't a big problem for me personally. What is a daily irritation, however, is the mirror surface of keyboard shell. It attracts fingerprints more easily than any opaque surface I have even seen. It requires constant polishing with the enclosed cloth or with tissue - if you care about its appearance. Clearly, Logitech engineers knew this was going to be a problem given they included a piece of velvety material to remove smudge marks.Despite the price and shortcomings, the diNovo Edge was a worthwhile purchase. Additionally, I consider it a good value from both an overall quality standpoint as well as in a return on my investment through productivity gains. If you spend a great deal of time typing and are looking for an extra \"\"edge\"\", I would suggest acquiring this keyboard.ProsPrecision keysBuilt in lithium-ion batteryCharging cradleAesthetics (sans fingerprints)ConsNo keypadMirror surface easily attracts fingerprintsUncontrollable beeping when depressing the Caps Lock key\"", "are there 2 different mac edition diNovo edge keyboards by Logitech? amazon has 2 listed for very different prices but i think there is just one so be sure you click the cheaper link if you still are inclined to purchase after reading my review...I had the original dinovo windows edition for nearly 2 years running with my mac mini home setup. I really loved the design/looks and the concept of a mouse keyboard combo for a home theater setup. So sold my old version on amazon (got a decent price) and bought the mac edition...Now the bad news... the mac edition is a little worse which pushes it into the DON'T RECOMMEND category. why worse you asked? Well it boils down to one feature - they made the left and right click buttons slightly smaller and rounded the edges. using the pc version was a little laborious but now with smaller click buttons, it's unusable. Clicking and dragging and dropping a file or a moving a window is near impossible and bloody frustrating. my cool home theater tool became a thorn in my side all because i traded in for the mac edition just to have a front row button instead of a windows home! I hope apple is listening and will improve on logitech's original concept - logitech has obviously lost the plot!if anyone wants to trade the windows version for my mac edition - get in touch, i still have the box"], "Gamma": [0.006138892844319344, 0.044579073786735535, 0.04537723585963249, 0.04537723585963249, 0.04537723585963249, 0.04537723585963249, 0.044347044080495834, 0.045287661254405975,
