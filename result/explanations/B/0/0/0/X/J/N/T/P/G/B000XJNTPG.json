Old classics mixed with newer genres makes the soundtrack eclectic and not boring. The story is fun and at times is hysterical. Gameplay is fun, yet simple.The best thing about this game? Cameos by real Heavy Metal artists! Ozzy? Halford? Lemmy? They're here and they actually make the game experience all the more fun. Try it, you'll like it!", "\"Brutal Legend is a great game. So great in fact it's only down fall is it concludes very fast. The saying goes \"\"Time flies when you're having fun\"\" and no quote could be more genuine when summing up Brutal Legend.To be honest I was excited about this game until I found out that in addition to the action oriented hack n slash game play it was also a real time strategy game. RTS has never been a genre that appealed to me. I'm more about being a loner or in a small group as opposed to dictating the actions of up to 50 or so troops  with different strengths and weaknesses. Yet somehow Double Fine had me addicted to the RTS \"\"battle of the bands\"\" set up as well as the driving escort missions, gunning death rack tower segments, and even helping my head banger bros score beer and babes. Getting a gamer to be captivated by genres he normally dislikes is no easy feat. As a matter fact to date I'd say Brutal legend is the only title that had me enjoy types of game play I'd normally be insanely frustrated by.While Brutal Legend is influenced by Heavy Metal I don't necessarily think you have to love that genre of music to be enthralled by what is offered. It tells a decent fantasy tale with its' own unique mythology.  Despite the fact Brutal Legend throws Grand theft auto, God of war,  Zelda Ocarina of time, and Over lord into a blender it retains being original and non confusing.Starting off Eddie Riggs is a likable hero. When I saw the first Brutal Legend trailer I thought maybe Eddie would end up being like Kratos aka a dumb enraged testosterone jock covered in leather and spikes. Instead Eddie cares about others, refuses to be a glory hog, and is more akin to that lovable best friend you knew in high school whom despite looking \"\"scary\"\" was very charismatic, generous, and optimistic.However Eddie does not start out our tale as a happy camper. Pretty much the game drops us into a scene where Eddie's talents as a roadie are being exploited by a tween pop band trying to pass themselves off as the new equivalent of heavy metal.  Eddie's awesome stage is referred to as \"\"ironic in a retro sort of way\"\" and one of the rockers gleefully enjoys breaking  guitars just so Eddie has to fix them. In a humorous kind of way the scene reminded me of Cinderella only Eddie is a guy and instead of having 3 wicked step sisters he has to contend with three jerk wad step brothers. Most of us would understand if Eddie cussed out the manager and quit on the spot but instead he selflessly saves one of the band members from plummeting to his death. Eddie's heroism is ironically rewarded by having a stage prop fall atop his burly frame. Riggs' martyred blood mingles with his magic belt buckle summoning an angry yet noble monster of yore. With a mighty roar Omigodan the fire beast slays the blasphemers stopping their terrible music than it whisks Eddie away to an enchanted dark fantasy world influenced by the awesomeness that is \"\"True Metal\"\".Yes, I realize this sounds cheesy. We can draw parallels to it being similar to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonder Land. However the rock n roll death metal studded presentation of the tired \"\"Stranger in a strange land\"\" plot device works perfectly.Upon arriving in an alternative lifestyles version Never Ever Land Eddie slays a bunch of blood thirsty occultists with an axe he finds then meets a sweet yet fierce young woman named Ophelia. She tells Eddie the robed weirdos he decapitated are the servants of the demon emperor Deviculous and that there is a human resistance trying to over throw their evil master. Equipped with his battle axe and electric guitar that can raise relics of ancient power or melt faces Eddie constructs a hot-rod on the spot, riding off into the sun set with the mysterious yet hot Goth girl to save mankind.You will proceed to interact with the lovable yet eccentric guardian of Metal Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy the hellacious biker healer, Lita the spirited Amazon, and Lars the golden haired hero who fast becomes your new best friend.  If these famous real life cameos were just thrown in to sell a bad product I would have felt cheated. As it stands they are woven in seamlessly with the world they are apart of. Every person in the game has good motivations for being the way they are and they seem more concerned with contributing to a good yarn than with out-staging each other.Brutal Legend has a sand box world. In truth you can blow through the story line as fast as a guitarist riding the lightning but if you go that route you are going to miss out on a lot of land marks, extra missions, hidden music tracks to play while driving around in your Druid Plow, world folklore, and secret guitar riffs which grant Eddie arcane war-spell techniques whilst battling making victories come much easier. Unearthing these mementos of the forgotten age likewise increases \"\"fire tributes\"\" which you use to upgrade your hot rod and fighting combos within Ozzy's motor lodges.The thing I really hope developers learn from Brutal Legend is its' perfect balance of campy humor and emotionally driven sincerity. While it can be stated Tim Schaefer's newest offering doesn't take itself too seriously it also doesn't undermine itself with an over abundance of bad ham and moldy cheese. Jack Black whom voiced Eddie walks the delicate line between satire and tragedy with perfect harmony. I honestly  have more respect for him now. I'm hoping future movie producers see Jack's true potential and stop giving him roles that undermine his hidden talent.By this point I've explained enough. I cannot say anymore without edging dangerously close to spoiler territory. This game is one that has to be experienced instead of merely read about. Words alone fail to express the creativity, awe, and mirth packed into this sour yet sweet nostalgic road trip through Heavy Metal heaven!Pros+Breath taking twisted yet beautiful world to traverse.+ Good blend of RTS, driving, exploration, fun mini games, and visceral combat.+ Acting and sound track are the best in the business.+ A tale that is not too grim yet not ridiculously silly either.+ Fun multi-player RTS battles over Xbox live+ The enemy types are scary yet outrageously hilarious at the same time. Every creature encountered is some sort of parody or tribute to the various kinds of heavy metal music.Cons-Game is a bit short but to its' credit the ending brought a smile to my face. (Unlike Fable 2. Cough.)-The upcoming down-loadable content is \"\"meh\"\" if you are more intrigued by the single player story line than you are the RTS aspects.-Tim Schafer is not renowned for making sequels. For those like myself who want a sequel we may have to bite off  a bit of bad tasting disappointment.-Side missions get repetitive and there are only around 4 types of them. For what its' worth these mini quests extend the game and they're fun for what they are.-Though I took to the mish mash of game styles some may be more puzzled than pleasantly surprised by BL's patchwork Frankenstein of genres.\"", "I love Tim Schafer, he is responsible for some of the greatest, most inventive games out there.Brutal Legend is very much the first game he's developed that has gotten the hype it deserves, and I hope it is successful because he deserves it.The story itself is incredibly inventive and fun, especially if you, like me, love metal. Jack Black is genuinely not annoying as the main character. The art design is phenomenal too.One thing that surprised me was that this was not at all the platformer game like the demo that I had downloaded. The emphasis seems to be a lot more on this sort of weird RTS thing going on, which I am not a fan of.That said, buy the game and support creative and interesting games that aren't FPS's", "The only two reasons why this game got more than one star is because I actually like Jack Black, and the soundtrack is freaking awesome.  The game play, though, lacks so much to be desired.  The story doesn't flow very smoothly at all, and the play control isn't very precise.  About 95% of the game seems to be boss battles, where you really can't tell whether or not you are even hurting the boss or how much damage the boss actually has.  The rest is just some hack and slash nonsense interrupted by some cool dialogue and music.If this was a movie, I would probably rate it much higher.  But it's not.  It's a game, and the game part of it isn't very good.", "When you hear people like me say I would rather have a fun game than state of the art graphics, someone was actually listening.ProsThis game is awesome. The storyline is great. With Jack Black, you know it is going to be funny and rock. Great music, great one liners, and fun and inventive gameplay. It is a mix of RPG style 3rd person, and RTS. Definitely an all around fun game that will keep you interested in the storyline through the end. I would recommend doing the side quests as you go.ConsThe game is short. Really the only reason it got 4. The bad thing about these new games is their price tags. I think that definitely reflects in most of the reviews of any game. It is hard to justify spending 60 bucks for a game that you can only play for a few days. It is easily a 5 star game if you ignore the price tag.I would like to see a better selection of things to buy from Ozzie.They set up the ending for a sequel, but apparently the odds of that happening aren't great.Didn't get a chance to play the multiplayer, but it is set up just like the stage battles on the main game which were actually quite fun. The main thing to keep in mind was to slow down and take your time with them.", "\"I picked this up after the price dropped. Not because I thought it wasn't worth the $$ but because I had so many other games to finish. Since I had some down time, I popped it into the 360 and have had a great time playing it.Lets get the very few low points out of the way:It is a somewhat short game if you follow the main story only. Get out there and find some of the hidden stuff like dragon statues and others that give you hidden songs, alters that provide short story plots and alters that are upgrade stations. OZZY is here and has some good one-liners.There didn't seem to be a whole lot to do while free-roaming though. Just look for alters and there are some short side plots you can find around the map.The GOOD:Well, OZZY being the Metal Master. He had great lines and the more you came back to see him, the funnier he got.LEMMY! Lemmy is a major character! Nuff said there.Lita Ford? What's not to like here?Graphics: Pretty good for a game that wasn't a huge budget game. I only had one time that I had a bug where I got stuck and had to respawn.Which brings us to difficulty. Death? Death is a petty thing. It frequently autosaves so you won't go back far and if you raised an alter, it doesn't make you go back and do it again. It only respawns you back where the autosave was but your progress is still there.Voice acting is campy but that's what this game IS!I recommend it to have a laugh and waste some time while listening to some good tunes on the games \"\"in-car\"\" radio.\"", "I bought this game for my boyfriend because he was talking about it and he really likes it so I'm happy that he's happy", "There is no game like this. Tim Shafer is very talented at making games. This one is no exception. The game oozes with artistic creativity that brings to life a form of heavy metal throught the world you explore. I am no heavy metal fan but I enjoyed the soundtrack provided for the game and the influences of it throughout the game. The characters are wildly unique with great voiceovers and animation. The story is while not overally impressive does have an interesting twist.As for the gameplay, it is very different than your typical action title how it layers on strategy elements. With this ability your able to have groups of fighters helping you out at a time and often times they are used to set up stage battles. Stage battles are pretty unique. Instead of using resources such as trees, rocks, gold, or whatever to gain more units, you instead does this by having lots of fans. To get fans you have build stage pieces. The more fans you get the units and better ones you will gain. As for simply yourself, you gain abilities through Ozzie Osbourne who provides you with new weapons, parts for your vehicle, and so on.This game is really fun but a bit short. The worlds you encounter can all be wildly unique but as I said, have that heavy metal influence. Don't worry if your not a fan of heavy metal. I am not but enjoyed the game. It is very humorous. I recommend this game to anyone fans of heavy metal or not.", "I initially liked this game but the more I played it the more I realized how rushed and short this game really is.  The music is great and the game is still fun to play but some of it is not well thought out. It is very repetitive. You can quickly earn more fire rewards than things Ozzy has to sell. There is not enough double teaming with the main characters since you can mostly do this in the major battles where all your time is spend commanding your troops.  The battle controls are annoying.  The individual orders command is deeply flawed.  The graphics while good are not as good as a game of this type should be.  The multi-player version of this game just sucks by making the commanding general be it Eddie or whoever much whimper than the one you become familiar with in the single player game, the car is useless in this version and hardly plows anyone down. Your character is basically just ordering your troops to take down this tower or putting up that tower  while fending off attacking hordes, until you get into position to take down the stage.  Looking for the last five of this or that like the dragons can become very tiresome and makes you want to turn to Internet cheats to find them for the reward things. There are a lot of areas on the map where you can't go and are just a waste of space. This game was way over hyped when it came out but it is still fun to play.", "Brutal Legend is not only a game... fans of classic rock will love it! As you play you enjoy an awesome playlist of the best rock! You can even edit which songs will be playing...The game is not too short but could be longer too... but it is a lot of fun!", "\"The Good: Creative and unique artstyle, superb voice acting, awesome tribute to metalThe Bad: RTS elements are out of place, a tad short, repetitive side missions, just feels like something's missingAhh good ol' metal. That is exactly what you'll say when playing Brutal Legend thanks to Tim Schafer's genius imagination, and Jack Black's great voice acting. Brutal Legend isn't exactly revolutionary, but it does have some ideas that are interesting.When it comes to the story this is one of Brutal Legend's strong points. You play as Eddie Riggs who is a roadie and gets sent to another world, and that world is full of metal. Eddie runs into many characters, but his main goal is to find out why he is there and defeat the evil lord Diviculus.The game starts out strong and shows you the ropes of combat and your Deuce. Yes the vehicle you drive around in the big open world. Combat consists of a strong attack and a normal attack followed by your axe. Your axe can shoot lightning upon foes or burn then. Along with this you can smash down on the ground to send foes flying. There are some upgrades you can get that will extend combos and lead into using your axe, but combat is pretty shallow. Nothing ever really evolves, and it can even be a bit sluggish at times and a tad unresponsive. Upgrading the pain and strings on your guitar can make certain attacks more powerful. Not only can you upgrade your axe, but the Deuce as well (more on that later).While you may think combat sounds shallow you can also use \"\"super powers\"\" which are little riff mini-games that can do certain things. The main ones you will use will be the one to summon your Deuce anywhere. Another is the face melter which is followed by a great camera cut of melting faces! There is even one to rally your troops, block your enemies from creating more troops and so on.Finding the relics for these powers is a huge pain since the world is so big and finding these rare relics can be tough, but wait a second I'll get back to the open world later.First let's finish combat. Yes you can upgrade your vehicle with weapons to help shoot down foes and even get a secondary weapon such as mines or flame throwers. The main focus of the game is RTS...wait...what? RTS? You're kidding me right? I thought this was a God of War type game...I'm very sorry, but this is true and while it works it is the game's biggest let down. I too thought this game was all action adventure until I got hit with a tutorial on how to do this. Well to make things simple all your basic RTS elements are here: Creating troops, upgrading your \"\"base\"\" to create stronger troops, and collecting \"\"resources\"\" to fund all this. With a unique take on RTS you have to build \"\"merch booths\"\" on green holes in the ground to create fans which in turn let you create troops. Upgrading your base, up to two times, lets you create greater troops like roadies, bouncers, and even fire barons. You have basic troops (head bangers) and chicks that shoot fire out of their guitars. There are a lot of units, and while you command them around the map via a light you can tell them to hold, attack, go to, or follow you. Eddie gets to fly around the map and when you need to aid your troops you can use any of your \"\"special attacks\"\". If you Eddie dies he respawns at his stage thanks to his fans.Now while all this sounds simple it really is TOO simple and could have been cut from the game. There are \"\"in between\"\" levels that have you fetching these troops, or going from A-B and I really liked those missions better. The RTS just took too long and felt out of place in an action adventure type game. I was also disappointed to see only two boss fights which were at the beginning and end, thus the developers using side missions as fillers in between story missions. These side missions are interesting at first, but become extremely repetitive since there isn't much of a variety.Side missions vary from helping the Ironheade (yes with an E so people know we're serious...) members ambush an enemy convoy all the way to racing. Some other missions consist of using your vehicle to fight off convoys and the rare unique side mission. There is even a hunting record breaker, but this allows you to send that creature into battle to help you fight. Of course you get something for completing these missions and that is fire tributes. Think of these as currency to buy stuff at the store.My favorite part about the whole game is actually the art style. Everything from the trees to the rocks to the animals is influenced by metal from the 70's ad 80's and Double Fine captured the feeling perfectly. The graphics are amazing and the voice acting is top notch, but you can't help but notice the attention to detail in everything. Not only is the art style unique, but the execution as well such as the dry ice mines, and the great wall which is made of amps that are so powerful they can kill you. Everything is pure metal and so is the great 40+ song soundtrack.Brutal Legend isn't for everyone, but metal heads or people who just appreciate great games or music will enjoy this very much.\"", "I was expecting so much better.  The gameplay is terrible, story is weak, and its not that funny.  The voice acting is decent.  From what I read I was expecting something new and fresh, instead I got a bad game.", "I applaud the games concept (the whole metal tribute) and love a lot of the ideas - like the 'headbanger' units. It's really enjoyable in that aspect, and there was a spot or two where I definitely laughed out loud.However the actual gameplay is just not that enjoyable to me. Maybe it's just not up to the stellar standards of so many of the games i've played, or I've been spoiled by amazing PC RTS games, but I just don't find the actual battles very engaging or enjoyable. Also, I've found myself frustrated at a few parts of the game, which is never a plus!", "You can always count on Double Fine when you need a game that really deviates from the norm. Run by the legendary Tim Shafer, their games are about as unique and funny as they come and Brutal Legend is no different. Sometimes, however, Brutal Legend can seem to be a style-over-substance affair, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This game's style is so completely rad and over the top that it can't help but overshadow the gameplay at times, and that is a good thing.First off, the game's strength: the art direction. Imagine taking every epic metal album cover you've ever seen, combined with Frank Franzetta's paintings, Norse Mythology, Conan the Barbarian, and anything else you can think of that is metal related. If you associate it with headbanger music, this game has it in some form and it is a very faithful, loving tribute to all things metal. Then, dial up the testosterone to 11. Seriously, this game is epic! The environments really steal the show, and there's a lot of variety. Metal music is a huge category of music, with tons of sub-genres that all fall under its umbrella. This game features it all, from 1970's Black Sabbath era attitude and visuals, to an area that is all goth-black-death-metal. The characters and creatures all appropriately represent all of heavy metals's variety as well. It's pretty cool.Since the premise of the game is hugely based on a genre of MUSIC, the soundtrack is pretty awesome. I personally enjoy SOME styles of Metal music, but not all. In general, it isn't a kind of music I find myself seeking out in my personal life. Still, I really enjoyed it in this game. It also features the voice talent of Jack Black as the main character. He did a really great job at furthering the charm of the game. It also has some of Metal's biggest figures in real life as well. Lemmy Kilmister(Motorhead), Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Lita Ford (The Runaways), and Ozzy Osborne are all in here, and they do a fantastic job at bringing life to their respective characters, who are already very likable and fairly deep. I was pleasantly surprised. The writing, as you would expect from Double Fine, is both charming and hilarious. The story in this game is campy and funny at times and surprisingly poignant and touching in others. I was very impressed by it. Great job Double Fine!The gameplay is by far Brutal Legend's weakest point. It's not bad at all, but it really isn't that great. Brutal Legend is a long island iced tea combination of gameplay ideas. In this game, you'll be playing an open-world game, a real time strategy game, a hack n' slash, a music rhythm game, a racing game, and several others. It all really comes across as s a jack-of-all-trades but master of none, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the game. It is worth noting that fact going in.Now for the problems I have: There is hardly any variety to the tasks to do outside of the story (hunt this animal, race this guy, shoot a mortar at these bad guys, defend this base, and of course, collectables), but the game sort of requires a bit of it. The tasks aren't poorly executed or bad in themselves, but there's hardly any variety and you'll quickly tire of performing them. Unfortunately, if you want the points to level your magical guitar, axe, hot-rod, character, etc, you have to do them. Also, this game is very, very short without the paltry diversions, about half the length I expected and would have liked. Still, these are minor qualms, and overall this game is one worth enjoying.Overall, this is a game that exceeds in its art direction, audio, story, characters, and falls a bit short in its gameplay execution, gameplay variety, and length. Does that mean this game is not worth getting? Absolutely not! The strengths of this game are so excellently implemented that the good definitely outweigh the bad, but not enough to keep it from losing a single star. I'd still buy this game and recommend doing so for anybody out there that is interested. For metal fans, this game is a no brainer. Get it. For those that are a fan of Double Fine, get it. For the greater number of people who aren't fans of metal or don't know who Tim Shafer is, I'd still recommend it. It's a very lighthearted, unique experience, and a breath of fresh air from the constant barrage of sameness in games these days. Buy it, headbang to it, bring the enemies of metal to their knees with its awesomeness!", "\"Brutal Legend is a fantastic journey into a video game representation of the heavy metal music genre starring Jack Black and the legends of the art form in a madcap adventure that combines elements from a great many styles of gameplay to make for an unforgettable (albeit brief) gaming experience for fans of heavy metal.  Newcomers to gaming might be put off by the RTS learning curve, but veterans should have no trouble adjusting to the multiple game types.  Virtual explorers will have plenty of ground to cover and hidden treasures to search for and there is even multiplayer if you feel like battling you Xbox Live buddies for metal supremacy. Given the extreme brevity of the game, I'm glad I got it for only $20; but at that price it's well worth it since this is the kind of game you are going to want to play more than once. Brutal Legend opens with one of the funniest cutscenes ever. While watching this brutally sweet intro, you have the options to PG-13ify your gaming experience to bleep out the swearing and do away with the dismemberment. If you are a loser, that is.Eddie Riggs is the best roadie in the business, but he is not pleased with today's popular metal scene. He longs for songs about vikings and album covers with demonic monsters on them and singers who shriek as if they were being dragged into the bowels of Hades. Well, he's about to get his wish. Finding himself transported to a savage land filled with demon nuns, rocker chicks, and medieval weaponry, Riggs finds is true calling when he encounters a group of human rebels waging war against the Tainted Coil race of demons. All they need is for somebody to show them the ancient power they lost. The power of METAL!  Brutal Legend is really more like 5 games in one. It's a hack-and-slash action game that has Eddie wielding his two weapons (guitar and battleaxe) to mow down the baddies with cold hard steel, pyro, and of course, heavy metal thunder. He gets around the world in his highly customizable hot rod The Demon Plow (affectionately referred to as The Deuce) which he can summon anytime by busting a sweet guitar solo. These solos are activated in a Guitar Hero-like sequence of timed button-presses and serve many purposes throughout the game from uncovering relics to delivering orders to troops or slaughtering large groups of baddies (by melting their faces, see). The landscape is littered with side quests that earn you Fire Tributes (aloft lighters), which indicates favor with the Metal Gods and is used for currency to upgrade your weapons, abilities, and vehicle. Waiting to be uncovered in every corner of this epic land are chained stone beasts who will grant you power and tales of the history of the world you now inhabit if you can figure out how to release them. Plus there are bonus songs and powerful new solos to discover and unlock. Most of your time will probably be spent just cruising around smashing random hordes of demons and staring at the amazing landmarks while you search for more hidden hotness. Exploration is very important in this game.The meat of the game's primary missions revolves around the \"\"stage battles\"\", where Eddie sets up a rock show war machine to run the enemies of their group Ironheade out of town. These large-scale battles are a simplified version of the classic real time strategy format, but can also incorporate the other aspects of the game for a unique experience. Flying above the battle on wings of a demon, Eddie can summon and give orders to his troops or he can get personally involved by kicking tail on foot or in The Deuce. He can also activate powerful double-team attacks with any member of his army, which is very cool. My personal favorite has to be the mosh attack, where Riggs thrusts a devil horns hand sign in the air and calls his troops to gather around while they bang their heads in unison and bowl over enemy infantry. It makes for a very cool and funny gaming moment. Brutal Legend has a lot of those. Over the course of the game, Ironheade will not only take on the Tainted Coil, but the evil forces of Lionwhyte (representing for hair metal) and the emo/goth-tinged Drowning Doom. The way these armies and their leaders are presented is extremely satirical and is a blast for music fans familiar with the countercultures they represent as they trashtalk their way through each fight.Now all this is well and good, but what really makes the game a must is the story, the cast, and the music. Sadly, the story is short enough to easily play through in one sitting, but it is funny enough that you'll want to play it more than once and you will have to spend significant time to see everything there is to offer. The soundtrack is MUCH longer than the game and I still haven't heard all of the ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN songs included. The music is a diverse sampling of various styles of metal featuring everyone from big names like Black Sabbath and Rob Zombie, serious death metal like King Diamond and Loki, 80's pop metal from bands like Def Leppard and The Scorpions, industrial from Ministry and KMDFM, power metal from Dragonforce and Manowar, and a hell of a lot more. Naturally, the metal gods who lent their voices to the game also lent their music and Jack Black's folk/metal band Tenacious D is on hand, of course. The way certain classic songs are used in the narrative is pretty awesome too. Now, I keep telling you about how great the characters voiced by the legends of heavy metal music are so you're probably wondering who they are.  Well, do you want to lead a cadre of headbangers flanked by Lemmy and Rob Halford on choppers to smash up an emo pity party?  Yeah, you do.  Do you want to ride out of the underworld with a brand new batch of weapons while Ozzy shouts \"\"Go f@#%ing CRAZY!\"\" after you?  But of course. Sadly, the late great Ronnie James Dio was stricken from the game due to a tantrum by a certain Prince of Darkness (or more likely, his wife) and his absence in this is HUGE. I'm sure Jables was devastated by this criminal omission and the fact that I played Brutal Legend mere days after his passing didn't help. Still, Dio or no, one cannot underestimate the awesomeness of battling a giant chrome spider to secure the steel webbing necessary to string Lemmy's bass so he can heal your Lita Ford-inspired ladyfriend (Ford also voices a character). That's right: Lemmy Kilmister's bass-playing heals the sick in this game. I always suspected he could do that. The story is only a few hours long, but its' packed with awesome and a surprising amount of emotion for what is essentially a spoof. The game does a masterful job of slowly introducing the various elements and it never gets particularly challenging on normal difficulty. The only way I really died is by carelessly driving off of a cliff (or ten).My biggest complaint with Brutal Legend is that it feel as though it's just getting started when it's already over. By the time each game element is brought to bear, you are at the final confrontation and already anticipating the next big battle that will never come. This is just plain wrong. There's only one battle in the whole game where you have your entire selection of units to utilize. What the hell? On the other hand, multiplayer allows you to challenge the computer or another player to rock as many stage battles as you like as either Ironheade, the Tainted Coil, or The Drowning Doom, which is an excellent addition. However, the difficulty is ramped waaaaayyyy up on these so the clumsiness this RTS veteran showed integrating into the different aspects of the main game's stage battles did not go over well.  The multiplayer AI plays to win. All in all, the only real problem with Brutal Legend is it's extreme brevity and failure to integrate the entire world into the story. If you want to see all of the great metal-themed visuals, music, and powers that the game has to offer you are going to have to spend a lot of time just driving around. The main game's stage battles are few enough that it feels like they are more of a tutorial for the multiplayer (which is NOT the reason to get this), and that's a big wrong. But still, at a discount price and with all the great music and heavy metal coolness of this game, it's still a rockin' way to kill some time.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.025923853740096092, 0.019900940358638763, 0.06809409707784653, 0.045095935463905334, 0.09074292331933975, 0.0720064640045166, 0.08368344604969025, 0.038789331912994385, 0.02841666340827942, 0.09767941385507584, 0.000804269453510642, 0.1349032074213028, 0.08361570537090302, 0.16202446818351746, 0.048319291323423386]]}
