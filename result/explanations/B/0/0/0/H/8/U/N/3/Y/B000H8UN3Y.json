"], "reviews": ["\"Being that this is the \"\"ultra\"\" deep cleaning formula expected better results than the original Biore strips, but I got the same results.  Upon first applying the strip, I immediately noticed the tea tree oil aroma.  After leaving the strip on for 15 minutes and letting it completely dry, I was left with a white residue all over my nose and it was especially caked into the crease between my nostril and cheek.  The strip only had a few small blackheads on it, the rest were still on my nose.  It seemed to take out the smallest blackheads but left behind the largest ones which are the most noticeable and ones I want to get rid of.In my opinion I don't think these strips penetrate pores enough to pull out the majority of blackheads.\"", "I have tried just about every pore strip available and most of them, including the original Biore, have given about the same results. Application with the new Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strip is the same as before - you wet your skin, dry your hands then peel the strip from the plastic backing and apply to your nose. After about 15 minutes, the strip should be hardened to something similar to paper mache. Gently peel the strip away and you can see just how much dirt, sebum and blackheads are removed. After just one use of this newest version of Biore's Ultra strips, you can see a HUGE improvement over any other pore strip on the market. The strip itself is larger than the original and contains witch hazel and tea tree oil, both of which help minimize the pores and for me, have a wonderful soothing effect. I do think these strips hardened a bit more than the original so if you have sensitive skin, you will want to be especially careful when pulling them off. My only negative comment is the cost - all of the other Biore versions of pore strips (along with other brands) are much less expensive. But even with the premium price tag, you will never go back to anything else.", "The trick I've found when using Biore strips is to make certain the strip gets very wet/moistened. The more water, the more the glue on these sticks to your face, and the more stuff it will pull out when you take it off. Just be certain to leave the strip on till the strip is very dry and solid. That way the glue has attached to everything it's going to, and will come out with you pull it off. Biore strips are also great for using on the chin, not just the nose.I was teen and Biore first came out with their Pore Strips and loved the idea that something could pull blackheads out of your pores. I found that the more open your pores are, the better these work. Now all these years later my pre-teen daughter uses them to help her complexional. One thing I have found is they don't exactly pull anything out from the tops of your nose, but it's a magnet for anything in the pores on the sides. That's where you really notice these working. What these strips pull out from the sides, you usually can't even see before they pull them out. It's similar to the experience of waxing your eyebrows. When you wax, you're expecting to see the dark eyebrow hairs get pulled out, but are then surprised to sell a bunch of fine light colored eyebrow hairs there as well you didn't even realize were there to begin with. These strips work the same way, pulling out some stuff you didn't realize was there.", "\"I really like several face care products with tea tree oil and like that these strips feature it on the pad along with witch hazel. While you only get 6 strips in this box compared to eight in the boxes that aren't \"\"Deep cleansing\"\" these are cheaper, so the price per strip basically evens out. I looked into this because I was contemplating taking ordinary strips and moistening them with tea tree oil and witch hazel instead of plain water if these had a much higher purchase price.If I ever found a great deal on the plain ones, I would still try this technique out as I really feel like these offer slightly better results beyond the clean scent and tingly feeling they provide. Despite the fact that I cleanse before using regular strips, I still felt like my nose was nicer looking in terms of smoothness and pore refinement after the \"\"deep\"\" ones.\"", "I've noticed that with this product, the strips tend to take a while to harden compared to other brands, which is a really good thing in my opinion. The other brands' strips would act like those Screen Protectors for your phones, where you would get air vacuum on some spots. But, not with this one.", "For some reason, I thought the Ultra pore strips were just a slightly larger version of the originals. I know as soon as I opened them this was not the case. While they are VERY SLIGHTLY bigger, they also have a totally different smell. Personally, I couldn't really tell a difference between the normal strips and these.", "I used these pore strips as directed. Washed face, applied strip and waited 10 minutes. It was completely dry by then. Removing it was more uncomfortable that I expected. What really bothered me, though, was the gooey residue it left behind at the edges of the strip. I had to wash my face again to get it off. Anyway, after closely examining the used strip, I saw that it removed some debris from the pores, but not as much as I would have expected. I also noticed a few fine hairs.", "\"These Biore \"\"Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips\"\" work great at removing pore clogging dirt from your nose and it is oddly satisfying (if not a little gross) to see the results. My teens have used Biore products with good results for years and this is decent addition to their skin care regimen.Using as directed will keep your nose pores clear but it can be a little rough on dry skin during the winter months. My kids have noticed an improvement in their completions since starting to use these at night.Highly Recommended!CFH\"", "\"I very much like the original version of the Biore strips, and was interested to see what the \"\"ultra\"\" version could do. They perform very well, but I really can't discern any appreciable performance difference.The ultra has some additional ingredients (tea tree oil and menthol) not found in the original version. The ultra also boasts of having witch hazel, but that is also found in the original. The ultra has a scent, which I assume is due to the menthol; the original does not have a scent. It's not a bad scent, but it didn't do much for me - I'd just as soon have it not be scented.The ultra is supposed to do everything the original does, plus \"\"invigorate.\"\" I didn't experience any invigoration. It worked just fine, but no difference in end-results from the original.Both work very well, and deserve 5 stars. However, given the price per strip differential (the original comes 8 per box versus 6 for the ultra), I'll stick with the original (and my deepest apologies for not being able to resist that phrase).\"", "When I get pore cleansing strips, I always get Biore Ultra Deep. The Ultra Deep do a better job than the regular, though they are a bit harsher. They are easy to use: Get them wet, put them carefully on your nose -- make sure you press down into the seam between your nose and cheek -- then wait until they dry. When you pull them off, do so somewhat slowly. You can see all the blackheads and clogged pores you pulled out, they will be stuck to the strip.My nose has always had enlarged, often clogged pores, and all over the nose. Pretty much every pore is a problem. These strips have been tremendous in helping me control that. My only quibble is that they are not always effective. Sometimes I will see entire spots on the strip which pulled out nothing, yet you can see on my nose that the strip should have grabbed onto something and removed it. But sometimes I use a strip and it gets literally everything. Every so often, some of the sticky side of the strip is left behind on my skin, so I have to get some astringent to wipe it off because it's quite difficult to remove.I also don't recommend using these more than once a week, because they can be harsh. Overall, I will keep using these, but do wish they were just a little more consistent.", "The cleansing strips are made especially for the nose, but my neediest area (I have no idea WHY) is my chin, and they do an amazing job there! Of course I also use them on my T zone to keep those pores clog free, too. Recommended!", "I love using these strips! They are a lot of fun to use and they really do leave my skin feeling clean and fresh. I love the new cut lines in the nose strip to help with contouring and find that this strip fits much better than the older original strip. Using these once a week my nose looks clean, fresh and spot free. I think they are worth every penny!", "I love the way these strips make my face feel after I peel them off.  O love seeing all the dirt and gunk that came off of my face.  These strips are even easier to use than they used to be.  Just make sure not to use them more often than recommended or you could really irritate and dry out your skin.  These are a great way to deep clease the skin.", "\"\"\"Blackheads\"\" are small black dots that form when dead skin cells and other crud covers open pores.  The long term treatment for them is exfoliating scrubs, acne washes, or other face washes designed to clean pores, or to see a dermatologist.  In the short term, one good solution is deep cleaning pore strips like these.  You stick them on, ideally after a shower, let the glue set, then pull them off, removing the blackheads in the process.These are quite a bit more expensive than Biore's regular strips.  I didn't notice a difference, but apparently, what you get for your extra money is more glue.  No complaints, but I'd recommend trying the less expensive first, then upgrading if you think it's necessary.\"", "It has been forever since I have tried a nose strip. I was expecting a forest of pore residents to be standing on the pad when I tore it off, but I guess I must keep my face cleaner now; several pores made benefit of the deep-cleaning of the pad, nonetheless. It is refreshing putting one of these to use.The process is easy; all it takes is me washing my face [and nose], leaving my nose wet, peeling off the patch backing, applying  the patch and pressing firmly with dry hands and then waiting fifteen minutes or so. Once the strip dries to the form of my nose, I slowly lift up on the edges and voil&agrave; - clean pores!Not to be gross or anything, but this is much easier, and likely better for the complexion, than scrunching and squeezing. I do not want capillaries showing when I get older. Bior&eacute; strips are bomb!", "\"I've been amazed at the little spikes on a Biore strip when you pull it off your nose since they were introduced.  What is that stuff anyway?  Blackheads and sweat and lotions and gunk?  All that was in my pores!??  These Ultra Deep Cleansing strips take things to another level.  And it feels like, in order to do that, they had to add more of whatever it is that hardens (cement?! :) ) to the strip.  These things harden TIGHT and you need to remove them slowly to avoid losing a layer of skin.  But what is on that strip will fascinate (or perhaps nauseate?) you!  I don't feel like these strips are an overall solution and I'm not sure they're even necessary, but they do serve as a sort of \"\"cleanse\"\".  If you've let your facial routine lag, get a good start to clear the pores with one of these, then get back on the daily routine.\"", "I am a huge fan of Biore products and use several of them.A couple things surprised me about this one.First, I found it somewhat painful when taking the strip off my nose. I'm not the biggest baby out there, but I did feel some genuine discomfort when I removed the strip.Second, after removing the strip I saw virtually nothing on the strip. I do use facial scrubs and other cleansers, so my skin might not be too dirty to begin with. Still, I do have to say that the area where the strip was removed did feel smoother.Ultimately, I don't feel a real need for this product.", "I like how effective they are at getting the minute black-heads off your nose. Not to be gross, but I still remember the first time I used them - the strip looked like it had a forest of little spiky black specks. All of my black-heads were gone.Though there are other brands out there now, I still gravitate back to the Bior&eacute; strips.", "I used the original Biore strips all the time as a teen; this new version is a significant improvement.  It's easy to apply, softer and covers more area that the original Biore strips.  With the tea tree oil and witch hazel, it gives a nice cooling as it dries.  I could smell the witch hazel, but it wasn't unpleasant and had sort of a refreshing, clean scent.  Removal was painless (none of the ouch factor that I remember from the originals!) but they are nonetheless quite effective; my pores are noticeably smaller, and my skin looks smoother and much clearer.  I am definitely a fan of this new generation of pore strips.", "When I use my 66-year-old eyes to look at myself in a regular mirror, I'm not too horrified, but, holy heck, that 8X mirror is enough to give me a heart attack.  Wrinkles aside, I thought I was too old for blackheads, but there they were in what I now realize is a really ugly nose.The blackheads are small and I thought I'd try these strips to clean out the pores.  If nothing else, maybe the strips could pull the whole ugly nose off.  Well, I'm pretty sure these would be effective for most people.  As they dry, they tighten nicely and feel refreshing and when pulling them off you really should expect some results from all that ouchiness.Unfortunately for me, I've been using microdermabrasion scrubs too regularly for some years and I think that has cleaned my pores well on the surface.  These imperfections I was trying to remove with the strips are too deep to be picked up.  I'm still giving the product 4 stars.  Although not successful for me at this stage in my life, I suspect I would have loved to use them when I was 16.", "I have used theBiore Deep Cleansing Pore Stripsand these strips, and honestly except for the mintiness I can't tell the difference.  Both worked well, removing nastiness from my nose, and both were easy to use.Given that they are essentially the same -- ie., I couldn't tell that one removed blackheads more effectively than the other -- I would purchase the one with the best price per unit.  There are 6 in this box (the Ultra Deep cleaning) and 8 in the regular old Deep Cleansing.  Do the math and shop accordingly.", "I use these regularly and find their effectiveness excellent. They remove blackheads. Period. I don't find the removal part painful if you do slowly. No allergic reactions and love it!", "This product works better than I expected, but not as well as I would like. It does remove some of the blackheads, but not all of them, and repeated usage doesn't improve on that. My nose does look clearer, but after a month of weekly use my pores are not any smaller. At $1.00 a strip, I'd rather invest my money in a good face wash.", "I've been using Biore Pore Strips off and on for many years now.  I really like them.  My nose looks and feels so much better and cleaner after using them.  If you've never used them before you'll be amazed at the amount of stuff that comes out of your pores and onto the strips.  It's like looking at a porcupine.  Yeah, it's gross thinking that all that stuff was compacted into your pores but it's also neat seeing these strips work.I have to be honest and state that I don't notice any difference between using the Original and using these Ultra ones.  If the price were the same for both and you got the same amount then sure I'd grab the Ultra ones because maybe studies show they get rid of more but to my naked eye and touch I'm fine with sticking with the Original ones.Biore Pore Strips work really well as long as you follow the directions.  It may be a bit uncomfortable when removing them but it's nothing horrible.  My skin is very thin below my eyes so I don't push it down in that area at the very top but other then that I use them just as you should and they're incredible.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.", "\"I had been looking forward to using these and seeing the results; but after following the directions and removing the strip there has been no noticeable difference.Possibly if there were more debris in my pores and blackheads the results would be different, but seemingly for noses that do not have, as their product description says\"\" headstrong pore-clogging dirt\"\" there is not always the cleansing of pores that one would hope for.\""], "Gamma": [0.23305673897266388, 0.22593264281749725, 0.26275336742401123, 0.27825725078582764], "Beta": [[0.040735550224781036, 0.04207024723291397, 0.03316854313015938, 0.033824436366558075, 0.041749801486730576, 0.04115593060851097, 0.0426197424530983, 0.03848555311560631, 0.05454663187265396, 0.03402116894721985, 0.042975153774023056, 0.0402165949344635, 0.04359471797943115, 0.04018918797373772, 0.04172840714454651, 0.030563704669475555, 0.04234325885772705, 0.04007970169186592, 0.03790181875228882, 0.03752210736274719, 0.03415720537304878, 0.0431792214512825, 0.03871895745396614, 0.04401865601539612, 0.04043367877602577], [0.04081006720662117, 0.041738830506801605, 0.03320765867829323, 0.0336197093129158, 0.04169555380940437, 0.040958307683467865, 0.04223160818219185, 0.03863082826137543, 0.054544948041439056, 0.0338226780295372, 0.04262892156839371, 0.04021387919783592, 0.04332499951124191, 0.04021522402763367, 0.04155917093157768, 0.03132112696766853, 0.041959863156080246, 0.04002906009554863, 0.03801456838846207, 0.03782518208026886, 0.03452926129102707, 0.04372468963265419, 0.0390898697078228, 0.04412991181015968, 0.040174104273319244], [0.040390197187662125, 0.041371721774339676, 0.03308109566569328, 0.03263091668486595, 0.04195304214954376, 0.04110625758767128, 0.04243154078722, 0.038427531719207764, 0.05727753788232803, 0.03480343148112297, 0.0428115613758564, 0.040317047387361526, 0.04367326572537422, 0.04040875658392906, 0.04153285548090935, 0.02942604012787342, 0.04202249273657799, 0.03967291861772537, 0.03786982223391533, 0.03807901591062546, 0.0343877449631691, 0.0435781255364418, 0.03836197778582573, 0.04427295923233032, 0.040112126618623734], [0.03992491587996483, 0.04153702035546303, 0.032770611345767975, 0.03235841542482376, 0.042117584496736526, 0.041260186582803726, 0.042602259665727615, 0.03832794725894928, 0.057877153158187866, 0.035266079008579254, 0.042950015515089035, 0.04032685607671738, 0.04390314966440201, 0.040432896465063095, 0.041626349091529846, 0.02890770696103573, 0.042194291949272156, 0.03946240618824959, 0.03786206245422363, 0.038196466863155365, 0.03412783145904541, 0.04353461042046547, 0.03804986923933029, 0.04416268691420555, 0.040220651775598526]]}
