This game basically asks you to raise hell in Pacific City because you are armed right at the beginning with an assault rifle, a shotgun, and 8 grenades. As you perform good deeds like killing gangsters and their bosses you get upgrades for your powers like developing the ability to pick cars and large objects, getting powerful kicks and more. If you like GTA you should play this game especially for its art style, mission variety, cool powers, and your ability to destroy.", "\"This game is tremendous fun.  It's basically Grand Theft Auto where you are a genetically engineered \"\"supercop\"\" that must secure the city from the 3 major gangs.  As your powers grow, the game gets more and more fun.  There are only a few things that I do not like about this game, and they are all minor interface / control issues (cycle through targets,map interface, recover in mid-air from getting knocked off your feet).  Co-op over xbox live is easily the best feature about this game.  It could have been a bit more seamless, but it certainly works well.  Excellent game that I would definitely recommend if you love these sandbox type games.  I can't wait for Crackdown 2.\"", "\"I'm giving it 5 Stars because of it's ambition and beauty (sandbox style games deserve the most leeway because they try to do so much more) --- also it's pretty funny how you can't go two feet without causing a random non-mission fire fight and/or occasionally getting viciously blown up without warning. But not to worry, you can quicky \"\"regenerate\"\" at a nearby save point. Overall it's a beautifully rendered, fun, silly, and deadly world. The mission implimentation could use a bit of refinement and the random gunplay could be eased back a little --- mainly because it's usually unprovoked but also because you never get the sense that you make any progress in calming down this gang violence since the enemies simply keep regenerating. All this regeneration (you and your enemies) has it's good and bad points though. I mean it's good to know that there's always a casual enemy to fight and that you can always come back if things go bad.That said, I think the RPG style leveling up system here is a positive step in the right direction for games of all kinds. It's perhaps the most addicting element that video games can have --- it allows the player to make an emotional investment in and take ownership in the developement of the character. So I hope we'll see more of it in the future and, of course, even more compelling leveling systems.\"", "PROS:- Graphics are impressive and unique to fit the game perfectly- Leveling up your character and watching his abilities increase was the best thing going for this game.- Very chaotic fun. Tons of destructionCONS:- Gets old fairly quickly- No character development whatsoever and the story is BARE MINIMUM- *(THE WORST) Too much enemy respawning made it difficult to feel like I was making progress. (I literally killed enemies constantly coming out of a door for about 5 minutes before they finally stopped. It can take an hour or more to completely clear a dense area of enemies if you're the thorough type. THEY DON'T STOP COMING!)- Nothing much to do other than kill all the crime bosses- There's a guy. I wish you could kill him. I guess he's from the Agency you work for, and he gives you advice. And he never, EVERshuts up. I hope you like tutorials.BOTTOM LINE:Crackdown's core gameplay is almost the equivalent of playing an entire game of GTA on a 4-5 star wanted level. It's fun at first but it gets old after a while.", "There is nothing fancy about Crackdown.  You have your mission.  You need to kill the crime lords.  That's it.  There are no side quests.  There are some sandbox goodies, but even they are simply there to distract for a moment before engaging in the real task at hand.  Sure, I love extremely complex games that take a lot of mind power in order to unravel all of the mysteries contained within.  But I'm also a fan of some generic popcorn every once in a while, too.  And that's what this game is.  It's popcorn, but it's exciting popcorn.The game is extremely intuitive.  The world isn't that vast, but it's interesting nonetheless.  I feel that the smaller, but extremely detailed, world helped me to get to know the landmarks and neighborhoods much better.  I liked that.  And the play control is pretty smooth, too.  The missions, even though they are mostly the same, are pretty exciting.  In fact, I didn't have enough the first time through.  I had to increase the difficulty and play it again.But there are some flaws in this game.  For one thing, I wish that the Xbox controller would completely eliminate the ability to press in the toggle switches.  Nothing is more annoying than sneaking around an obstacle to get a good shot in the middle of an intense firefight only to accidentally jump high in the air as the opponent takes potshots at me.  This flaw is something that affected me numerous times while playing this game.  Being in a hurry to escape a situation that got out of control is completely ruined by accidental jumps because I can't avoid pushing in that stupid toggle when the action gets intense.  I also thought I'd add that there really is no reason to level up one's driving skill in this game.  The world is small enough so that exploring by foot isn't all that time consuming.  The vehicles are there for just a little eye candy, from the looks of it.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.  It's not very often that I play a game where I want a sequel where they do nothing but change the plot and the map.  This is that game.", "This game was alot of fun when it was $60 and now it is $30.  It is a free roaming, go any where, destruct-o match.  It was one of the more fun I had completing a game.  Unfortunately, online play is miserably slow and once you have leveled all the way up, the game quickly dulls.For $30, this game is a must buy for any XBox 360 owner.", "I tried not to like this game simply because of my distaste for Microsoft, but they still won me over with artistically done graphics, greats sounds and a game play that rivals some of the best of our time.  The game comes with lots of variety of game play.  Whether you be a fan of the timed running and jumping missions, races, just plan old exploration of an immense play area or simply playing straight through the game and killing the bosses, you'll like the game.  Leveling up your character adds more power to your various skills of dexterity, strength, explosives, shooting and driving.  The AI is fairly intelligent and seems to react pretty well to your advances.  The storyline is simple and attention grabbing.  Overall I'd say the game is a really fun 3rd person shooter type.If I had to complain about something it would be how short the game can be.  Once you get the ??firefly?? rockets (heat seekers)...the game is a breeze.  However Microsoft must have figured this out as they added a feature that allows you to reset the game bosses and levels without restarting your character's progress and weapons.  The game is cheap now so there really isn't any reason not to own a copy.", "Probably one the funnest games I have played since buying my 360! The replay value is huge and the challange of wanting to max out your character will have you putting this disc into your 360 again and again. The openness of the game is huge. Go where you want when you want. Don't want to take out the generals? Just want to go right for the Kingpin? Go for it! There's nothing stopping you. If you're afriad to spend another $60 on a game that doesn't deliver the goods then fear no more because this game delivers!", "Great game, I love the online Co-Op personaly. Its a basic shoot um up, clear the city of gang members with a sci-fi twist that your a super cop. You can run fast, jump high, and your one force to be reckoned with. Fun game its kind of short if you play it alot. I got into it and even after you finish it you can go online and have fun with others geting achievments and dukeing it out!", "\"i'm a mature gamer who bought a dozen or so games along with a new xbox just to see how the technology had evolved. (all the digital animation in recent films had piqued my interest.) having just opened grand theft auto 4 and assassin's creed, my first impression of this game was not favorable. but i've come to appreciate its unique and considerable charms. it is basically the urban sandbox, multi island, gansta life conceit of gta4, plus the rooftop play, \"\"assassination mission plus side missions\"\" concept of assassin's creed, but with a distinctively \"\"comix\"\" style of graphical design that is stylized to be less realistic, less textured, less graphically gory than either gta 4 or ac but more colorful, lively, and \"\"artistic\"\" than either. your avatar is not a thug but a maniacal police agent fighting evil and cleaning the streets, so you're not put in the position of looking at everything through gangster eyes, which is nice. however the most enjoyable innovation is a gruff voiceover guide who occasionally comments on your play (\"\"are you crazy?\"\" \"\"i sure love the smell of agent in the morning!\"\" \"\"you sure like to push your luck!\"\") along with gameplay and strategy tips; more than once his comments on my play made me laugh out loud. the avatar has physical and tactical skills that improve with use, notably the ability to leap and climb tall buildings if enough \"\"agility\"\" points are collected (these resemble the flags scattered around in assassin's creed) and the strength to lift and throw almost any detached object, from dead bodies to cement mixers, as weapons. but otherwise you have three options of play: roam the city to collect markers or perform racing stunts to improve agility; take on random firefights with street thugs to improve strength and skill, or kill off the senior members of three different crime gangs. these \"\"missions\"\" can be done in any order; each requires penetrating the gangster's lair after killing his almost endlessly spawning guards (though most do have a back entrance or rooftop way around defenders). this involves quite a lot of wearing down of the opposition, but each time you're killed and \"\"regenerate\"\", the enemy forces remain weakened, so you don't have to start the same exact mission, over and over, as happens in most games. the game physics are compelling, especially the explosions and flying objects, and the avatar has plenty of agility without cumbersome button combinations or programming limits. overall: a great game to look at, lots of fun to play, a very nice blend of humor and excitement, and no glitches in the xbox version that i could find.\"", "This is just one of those games that is extremely fun to play and addictive.  It's just a game everyone that has an xbox360 MUST have.  I especially love to play co-op online with friends.GET THIS GAME!!! - especially now because it's only $30!!!", "CrackDown is a fun game. You play as a super cop only known as the agent. This game is like GTA but you are not allowed to harm innocent people. I think it's better playing as a villian (like in Saints Row or GTA) than a hero. You can do what ever you want when you play GTA or Saints Row unlike this game. The game is very addictive for the first few weeks but after awhile it's pretty boring. The graphics in this game could have been alot better but instead they chose to make CrackDown look like a 3D cartoon. CrackDown is a fun game but if you are going to buy it wait untill the price goes down.", "\"It's getting harder and harder to forgive the little things, but here we go again.Crackdown is a great game that gets bogged down way to much in sub-par controls and unimaginative progression.  It's a great idea - you're a cop in a city full of crime, only you're awesome!  You can, like, jump on roofs and throw cars and stuff!  You start up as only sort of awesome but as you blow up guys and gather randomly placed orbs (orbs of awesome?) your powers get better.  Which works well enough because there's a progression and you get to earn your awesomeness.  And who doesn't want to become a pure truck-tossing baddass, right?  But not long into your journey to super-agent status - about the fifth time your little guy locks onto a passing car for no reason - you realize it's going to be an uphill trip.Your super cool looking agent can do lots of heroic things - drive cars fast, shoot guns, punch people into next tuesday - but he can't do any of them well.  Driving, even at the highest \"\"skill level\"\" is blocky and un-fun.  Shooting is unrewarding and there's no real difference in weapons; there's no reason to use the pistols over the machine guns, for example, even though there's a couple to collect.  And don't even get me started on the lock-on feature - it's unreliable and yet COMPLETELY necessary.  Good luck firing from the hip, you'll be lucky to hit the building the bad-guys are standing on.  Also, why the hell does pulling the trigger sometimes make me swing the butt of the gun?  And usually into the railing or piece of wall I'm tyring to take cover behind?  I've got a dedicated punch-in-the-face button, I'll use it when I need it, stop trying to force it on me, and STOP HITTING THE WALL!  Oh, and good luck with that punch button by the way.  Sure, when you connect with the bad-guy(or even the car they're hiding in)and they  go flying, it's pretty satisfying.  But that usual only comes after a riduculous amount \"\"turn around- no, turn around- no, turn, turn- there I got him- oh, I'm dead again\"\".  Being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound is cool, but the frustrating and overly-touchy controls murder even that bit of fun.  Aiming your landing is dodgy at best and when trying to jump you have two options - not enough to clear the curb and SUPER HIGH!  The imprecision of it is severly limiting, especially in a game where the enemy is so effective and numerous that it makes fighting them in the steet abosolute suicide.  It goes beyond making it \"\"challenging\"\": the bad guys with the crazy, heat-seaking guns are challenging enough.  This is about making the controls freaking broken.Forgive the rant, but with each generation of console, it's getting harder and harder to forgive these basic gameplay problems.But it's not all bad news.  The visuals abosolutely need to be praise.  Going in the opposite direction of photo-realism, they've still managed to make a city that clean and precise and visually stimulating.  And the distance you can see is marvalous - not just buildings but collectibles and cars and targetable enemies pop in and a vast distance.  It's really satisfying and immersive and shows the power of scaling graphics away from photo-realism and towards something much more artistically even and functional.So here we are, with lousy controls and interesting visuals (God, this intersection's starting to feel familiar).  What's needed to push this game into something worthwhile is a good-darn story.  Something compelling to keep my interest while I try to make my stubborn avatar do what I tell him to do.  But... no, not gonna happen.  You're fighting three different gangs (latins, asians and russians - groundbreaking!) in three modest sized sections of a city.  Each gang has lieutenants and then a general to hunt down (mini-bosses and a boss in video game parlance) in order to eliminate the faction.  But there's only a handful of each and finding them feels less like \"\"Succesful hunting\"\" and more like \"\"blind, stupid luck\"\".  To be honest I'm not entirely sure what grants you access to the boss locations.  Is it wandering near them?  Is it unlocking more skills?  The game doesn't tell me and I was never able to piece it out?What happened to the days ofMercenaries?  Four chapters!  Fifty-two targets!  Sprawling levels!  Remember those days?And yes, the city is nice (Champion City?  Capital City?  What the hell was it called?) but it really lacks personality.  It's described as this gang-ridden, crime polluted, horrible place than needs to cleaned up with rocket launchers... but it actually looks really clean.  And functional.  People live there, they drive around like normal.  If there's any shooting in the street it's all at or because of ME.  So... what am I cleaning up?  It feels like a small thing, but some grime in the city, or a change because of my actions would have felt rewarding after all of my jumping into walls and driving over civilians by mistake (again).At the end of the day, Crackdown is a decent game, I suppose.  Thing blow up, you jump over stuff.  But, ugh... just ugh...\"", "Crackdown is a funny game to review. It is quite fun for a few hours as you learn to play and develop your agent, but quickly becomes repetitive and then it abruptly ends.You begin the game with the agent a rather wimpy version of his future self. As you shoot, jump, lift, drive and explode things around all of this will improve. This stage is really fun, you go cracking down on the first gang, killing henchmen until working your way to the head guy. It is really fun to fight throwing a trashbin around and then see the agent becoming stronger and able to fight throwing cars or trucks around. As most have already mentioned the jumping interface is quite fun and give a real sense of freedom and superhero look.The graphics are above the old generation consoles but way below what the new generation is capable of.  That said it has a charming cartoony look that fits with the game mood of a super police agency battling crime.The problem is that the game is basically the killing of the three gangs, by the middle of your war with the second one you will already have you agent at his maximum stats and killing henchmen will start to look all the same. By the time you reach the third gang it is a chore. Besides, after you wipe out the crimelords in the city there is nothing really fun to do other than start all over again; the game doesn't pack that many hour of gameplay as a result.Why the relatively high score? The early game is really fun, the mixture of driving, shooting and kicking badguys around is hard to forget; and allows one to forgive the boring second-half and endgame.", "this game is really fun. i had alot of fun playing it and for the price you cant go wrong. i hope this game gets revamped for the xbox one cuz it deserves a better follow up than the 2nd.", "Crackdown was honestly a breeze to finish. The main story is over in several hours and the life it holds after that is relegated to collecting orbs and finishing the odd achievement... But, while the main story is going, and you first start gaining abilities and growing in power, Crackdown is awesome. You really feel like you are a superhero jumping from rooftop to rooftop and throwing huge things across the city. For this reason alone, it's worth getting. If they can add new gangs and ability growth via xbox live, the game rating definitely goes up.", "This is a very brainless fun game. Good for killing some time when you want to destroy some stuff. Not great by any means... but fun.", "Crackdown is a cel-shaded sandbox style fighting game in the style of Grand Theft Auto and Saint's Row - but this time you're on the side of justice. Sort of. Best of all, you get into the free beta of Halo 3!It's funny how many people are instantly buying this game just to get into the Halo 3 beta. We of course are thrilled about the Halo 3 part - we are avid fans of the Halo series - but Crackdown actually isn't bad on its own merits.First, you have to accept that it's cel shaded. The graphics are a little cartooney. They did this on purpose, and if you don't like being immersed in a dirty, swear-filled comic book, you might not take to this game. However, those who enjoy anime, manga and an alternate view of reality will appreciate the more-than-human powers you have here.You're an enhanced human in a future where three criminal gangs have taken over the world. You get the traditional types of enemies - a wisened old Chinese guy, a Hispanic drug lord and a Soviet mob boss. You get a variety of cars to jump into, a variety of weapons to shoot, and a fairly large world to roam around in.There are tunnels below the ground, places to jump across roofs, places that you can leap cars across, and much more. As you do things, you gain experience and better skills, meaning you can now shoot better or jump higher. This gives you incentive to build up your talents to get to those just out of reach areas.The game is pretty lenient - if you hide out for a while, your armor regenerates as does your health. When you die, they just give you another clone of yourself to keep playing with. You activate teleport spots around the world so you can get to places quickly.The soundtrack is reasonably good - there's a lot of variety here to choose from. The in-game sounds of local Hispanics chatting at you in Spanish, or the high pitched screams of scared civilians, all seem to fit in resaonably well with your cartoon environment.Graphics are, as mentioned, cel shaded. I enjoy cel shading and found it an interesting take on the GTA world. The HUD is esay to understand - it's clear what part of the body you're targeting and what is near you on the map. You get a mix of Kingdom Hearts orb-collecting with Vice City night clubs, Scarface swearing, and a bit of do-gooding in there, too. Assuming of course that you actually go after the bad guys rather than driving over the civilians.So where does that leave you? You're not getting top-drama and acting as in The Godfather. The cel shading might annoy some people. But really, for a fun jumping, shooting, roaming-the-world game, this is really quite fun.", "\"Okay. This was just a nightmare of a gaming experience. Just, unbeliavably terrible. Just downright horrible. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be a bad game for ten years ago. Or maybe for 2001 or 2002, as a late N64 or PS1 title. But considering this game is pretty recent,it's downright inexcusable. So why is this game so bad. Well, to sum it up, it's EXTREMELY hard, to the point of frustrating. Not to mention randomly spawning enemies. That's right. Randomly Spawning Enemies, like the kind you'd find in a Nintendo Mega Man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen, more enemies show up. And what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity? Why, even MORE enemies! \"\"A hit squad has been dispatched to take you out.\"\" Add this on top of a game that has really no direction, no storyline, or even point to it, and there's not even any reason to play it. It ain't fun, by any definition of the word.Basically, you're a genetically made SuperSoldier who is created by \"\"The Agency,\"\" all of the nation's law enforcement combined into one agency, and you're told by some annoying old disembodied Commander voice -who also serves as the game's narrator and the only actual \"\"character\"\" in the entire game- to wipe out three criminal empires. And off you go shooting, to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game, if you can even bare it that long. ALL you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops, and while the latter may sound fun in a Spider-Man sort of way, it really isn't. At least Spider-Man has webbing to control where he wants to go. You know, flying would be a whole lot simplier. And easier. Oh yeah. The game also has some very poorly conceived races. Either a rooftop race, which are usually extremely hard to beat in time, or some insanely stupid driving race, which if trying to drive isn't hard enough for you, trying to complete a Time Trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edge.When you start, all of your skills - Agility for leaping, Driving for absolutely nothing, Explosives for bombing, Strength mostly just for health, and Firearms for shooting- are all poor and barely usable. And after you've leveled up all of them as you go along in the game, well... they're still extremely poor. The only thing that increases is the leaping ability, in which you can go from 10 to 30 feet in leaping height. The sprinting speed sure don't increase like they say it does, that's for sure.Driving, is more or less, utterly pointless in this game. 95% of the time, you'll never be in a car! Which is good for two reasons because, for one, Driving controls are really really retarded. Both in setup and manuevering. That's how bad it is. Bad in the \"\"it's almost impossible to not run into civilians\"\" sort of way, even when your driving skill is near maxed out. Why they would even bother with a Driving skill, when the only time you'll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races, or mainly, to travel really far distances on the islands, is beyond me. But the other reason you won't be in a car much, is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game. According to the in-game \"\"Jukebox,\"\" there are over 100 songs in this game, and all of them are really bad, third party techno tracks. Like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in Europe. The game IS partially European, at least, which is why things are referred to in the game as a \"\"centre\"\" or a \"\"lift.\"\" It's odd considering that the game takes place in the near-future West Coast America and that other things like measurements (pounds, height in feet and inches, miles per hour) are North American standard, and not Metric. Anyway, the soundtrack is really European, really Techno, and really, really bad. Maybe they figured Techno music is \"\"futuristic?\"\" It doesn't matter anyway, because they could've saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs (which you can't cut off, by the way) for the car that you'll rarely be using, anyway. At least it's nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour you're driving, though, as you accidently plow into an idiot civilian.Strength is another almost utterly useless attribute. It's only effectiveness is raising your health. But to level it up, you'll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks, which is even more rarely used than a vehicle. 99.9% of the game is shooting, and you can only really raise your strength (health) by whacking an enemy with a gun, or kicking them, which does very little damage to them, anyway. You see, some of your skills are raised per usage. Meaning, the more you shoot, the more you blow stuff up, and the more you win races, the higher your stats will go, with 400 points being the maximum effectiveness level (even though the bar will continue to go up to 500.) But you'll almost never kick or hit an enemy, so raising this stat is pretty annoying.The other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs. Literally hundreds of orbs, scattered across literally every rooftop in the game, is how you increase your Agility. You don't have to collect all 500 of them to max out your Agility though, because of the rooftop races (although you really won't win those much) and the blue, \"\"Hidden orbs\"\" which increase a little of every stat. In fact, those were the only way I was able to get Driving and Strength skills up. The driving is bad, no matter what, though, and the Strength, although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons, is only useful for health. I had about 300/500 Agility orbs and 100/300 Hidden orbs, by the time I finished the game, and only Driving was lower than Level 2 (300 to 399 points).The shooting in this game, though, is severely flawed. And not because of the weak Firearms skills and weak firearms in the game. But by the Auto-Aim targeting being severely broken. I swear, this auto-aiming NEVER EVER EVER works the way you want it to. It sems to target only the most furthest enemies, or moving non-enemies first, and ONLY focuses on the guy right in your face when there's absolutely nothing left to kill. While the game does give you manual shooting as well, it's pretty hard to kill anything that's not close up to you with it. But the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that you'll never even see until you're already dead are the two biggest things that'll kill you the most with this game. And unless you really get into this crapfest of a game, you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times. I only had it on normal difficulity, and I died like 30 times within any given hour.All the guns are pretty weak, and when I found it, about late into the first gang and location, I wound up using the Harrington HMG 90 rifle throughout the remainder of the game. You only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game, by the way. The problem with all of the serious firearms is that they're power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times, with the Harrington being the slowest. I counted the reload time of this thing. Six seconds. Now picture that. In the heat of warfare, having to spend SIX whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun! Count to six and that's how much time you're waiting inbetween fire. In six seconds, you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload. And yes, being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game, I tried the Call of Duty style \"\"switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading\"\" tactic, only for that to not work as the stupid generic character you're using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out, so in order for the Call of Duty trick to work, I'd have to watch and make sure I don't go below ten bullets left and THEN, switch to the other gun in order for it to work, as the character's auto-reloading is completely and totally un-interruptable. SO annoying! WHY should a player have to endure crap like this? Throughout the whole game, I either used the Harrington despite it's insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher, as anything else would be ineffective, have too small of a clip, hold too little of maximum ammo, or simply be just too weak. Sounds fun, doesn't it?The \"\"characters\"\" in this game aren't even characters. There's you, the generic, namelss \"\"agent.\"\" (Maybe \"\"Agent\"\" is your actual name. I don't know.) There's the disembodied commander narrator/boss guy, who'll remark such sayings as, \"\"Go like the wind, agent!\"\" and \"\"Simply pathetic.\"\" when you die. Having the game insult you every time you die, and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw, is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny, little pieces. The \"\"bad guys\"\" are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever. It's like they looked in an LA phone book to get names for the Spanish lieutenants. There are three \"\"gangs\"\" that rule the city, but they're more like criminal empires because street gangs don't have that many soldiers and they don't actually run entire sectors of a city and it's inhabitants. They are  \"\"Los Muertos\"\" or \"\"The Dead\"\" (pretty clever, eh?), The Volk, and Shai Gen. Or... \"\"Generic Spanish gang,\"\" \"\"Generic Russian gang,\"\" and \"\"Generic Chinese Corporation gang.\"\"The key members of the gang, like I said, are about as generic-looking as generic can get and when you actually find out where they're located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them, you'll be rewarded with nothing, in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success. You see, the game developers thought that it'd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more \"\"fun\"\" by taking out key lieutenants, who each enhance the criminal empire, be it by firearms, number of soldiers available, vehicles, etc., so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader. But even WHEN you kill everyone else and save him for last, it's STILL virtually impossible, between the miles long approach to their headquarters, the endless spawning soldiers, and the enemy's eight life bars. Like most strongholds in the game, you're best to just run past everyone, trying to survive, and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you. Screw \"\"weaking their health\"\" or \"\"minimizing their recruits\"\" with killing the lieutenants, because they won't do much help for you, regardless. But then, I guess, the game would be too short. In this case though, that'd be a good thing.I should also bring up that the map is even messed up. Yes, that's right! Even the MAP is a pain in the donkey. Not only is the map horribly out-of-scale with everything else, and not only does the map not provide you with any GPS or waypoint marking, but you CAN'T EVEN ZOOM IT IN! The map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen. You can't zoom it in to see closer, or anything. And the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality, meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you! How often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of it's many, many flaws? Okay, so you can't zoom in, use a GPS, or even accurately know where you're at. Surely, the HUD \"\"radar\"\" map must be better, right? Nope. The biggest problem is, unlike ANY other game that uses an on-screen map, there's no \"\"N\"\" for \"\"North.\"\" Just four arrows, any one of them could possibly be north. There's a reason why they don't put the \"\"S\"\"outh, \"\"E\"\"ast, and \"\"W\"\"est on these, and this is why. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING! I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the game just to figure out which way was North. I often had to look one direction, pause to see the full map to see where I'm facing on it, and then, turn again until I got to facing North or where ever it is I had to go. How could they not have even gotten this right? It also would've been helpful if, being you spend most the game on the roof, to know which enemies were eye-to-eye level with me, above me, or below me. Usually, they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps, and all things below facing down. But, oh no, not in this game! I died so many times because I couldn't tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above, from below, or from so far away, they wouldn't even show up in the compass map screen. Every single enemy is just a dot. Even if they're above me or below me. It's things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given Grand Theft Auto title, where you don't have to try to figure out where North is, and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at. But not in this game! In fact, I've seen an effective map system in about EVERY Xbox 360 game that uses one, EXCEPT this game! Oh, and you can't even zoom the map in. Ins't that just something else?When you die, you have to restart from a \"\"supply station,\"\" most of which are few are isolated between locations, and all of them have to be found and unlocked. Oh, and they're ALL on roofs, meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them, and you could die just trying to get down from them! An elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time would've been nice. I mean, they actually HAVE them in the game and all, so it's not like they would've had to make one from scratch or anything. Any good gun you collect from an enemy HAS to be taken to this supply center/save point in order for you to keep it, or else, you'll lose everything you collected once you die. Sometimes, because of the random enemy pop ups, you'll, ironically, die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die. You could be at any given rooftop, look one way, then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you. Sometimes, you can even see them materialize in front of you. Sometimes, you'll restart at a save point and by chance, there'll be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead. I don't know. Maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun, but it's really not. Neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade. You can still die by gravity, by the way, so with each roof, you still have to be very careful.The only good thing I can say about the game is that there's no glitches. Oh, wait. There are! Like, constantly getting stuck in a wall, or a rampway, or even the ground! Stuck as in, \"\"this solid object isn't all that solid\"\" stuck. And the random enemies. That counts, too. It's bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area, the game will have a \"\"hit squad\"\" of about ten cars come up and bring MORE enemies to you, but to have the ones you JUST KILLED re-materialize right in front of you is just insulting. Like, why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you, and the dead ones simply return back like it's nothing? Your character is a genetic clone and \"\"The Agency\"\" can make an endless supply of you in case you die. What's their excuse, though?Overall, this kind of pointless 3D \"\"shoot and jump\"\" kind of simplistic game wouldn't have been so bad on the N64, the original Playstation, or even as an early Gamecube title. I mean, the comic-book like art style isn't anything impressive or new or advanced. 1999 to 2002, this game might've been acceptable. An \"\"average\"\" game, at best. But this kind of simple, pointless, storyline-less, linear \"\"shoot and kill just for the sake of it\"\" game is far below what today's standards are in gaming. To imagine that this is an Xbox 360 title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development, that it's heavily outdated by today's standards. When you can't even tell which way is North on your compass map, you can't even zoom in your menu-guide map, and every single character is as generic as a white and black-text can of government corn, it really isn't a game ready to be released. At least not in any year past 2003, on any system greater than maybe Gamecube. This game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just, really frustrating and lame and incomplete. I can't give this game a One because other than the \"\"getting stuck\"\" and \"\"targeting,\"\" there really aren't any glitches or bugs in it. The game is somewhat playable.However, when a game makes you want to break something in it's incompleteness, or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the 219th time, something ain't right. I can't imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game, not to insult anyone under thirteen, but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic. By the cover and art style, the game looks kind of cool. You sort of think \"\"Gears Of War\"\" combined with \"\"Saint's Row.\"\" You get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city. Sounds fun. And I'm sure, most people who bought this game bought it for the Halo 3 beta, but also because it looked or sounded like fun, right? However, I haven't played a game THIS bad since \"\"Sonic Heroes.\"\" (and I would include every other Sonic game since then, had I actually played those also-poorly-rated titles) This is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands, or sell to any gaming store, even if you can only get $2.95 for it. Shoot, ANY amount of money the guy offers you at a game store, you'll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore. I can't say it's a Legend in the \"\"Worst Games Of All Time\"\" ranking, but it's definitely one of those games you'll get rid of, by any means possible, just to not have in your collection. It's like the DVD of \"\"Gigli\"\" or \"\"I Know Who Killed Me\"\" in your DVD collection that makes everything else you own, as well as yourself, look bad just by it's mere prescence, so you get rid of it, possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too, and pretend like it never happened. Yes, this game is a \"\"pretend like it never happened\"\" kind of game.AVOID this disaster at all costs! It's not fun, it's frustrating, and it's not even in-depth.\"", "\"Crackdown is a euphoric, addictive rush that, unfortunately, doesn't last as long as you wish.  The premise is a Grand Theft Auto-style game set in the near future.  The originality of this game is what sets it apart from, and makes it in many ways better than, most GTA games and GTA clones.  This game is essentially a super-hero game, with the player controlling a genetically-enhanced crime fighter.  Remember how in GTA you would die the instant you touched water, or if you fell from a height of over 3 feet?  Well in Crackdown, you can jump OVER buildings, lift buses to hurl them anywhere you want, and you get better at everything simply by using your skill.  Remember the original Matrix movie?  This is what it feels like.  The more you shoot, the better shot you become, same with driving.Simply leveling up (a typical RPG element) works wonders in this game, meaning that simply jumping around the city beating up gang members is a blast.The GOOD: Non-linear missions.  No more fed-ex quests or escorting missions.  You are tasked to take out major crime bosses.  You can bump them off in any order you wish, and your actions have logical repercussions: take out the Russian mafia's gun supplier, and the grunts on the streets will have less lethal ordinance.  Awesome, addictive superhero play- jumping around a city has never been this much fun.  The graphics, reminiscent of \"\"A Scanner Darkly\"\" are awesome.  Just plain fun action all around.The BAD: Way too short.  Once you kill off all of the gangs... there's nothing to do.  You can run around the city, but with no baddies to fight, it gets old quick, since your character is all leveled-out by then.Bottom Line: Original, addictive and a blast to play.\"", "\"CrackDown - Circa 2007GOOD:- Great Co-op Gameplay allows two players play through the game from start to end. A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time.- Leveling up your characters traits (Jumping, Strength, Driving, Shooting, Explosives) makes your character not only better at that skill but also gives you bonuses (Example: Leveling up your Driving skill gives you not only better control over driving any car, bus and or truck but your Agency Car gets upgraded as well with new abilities, such as adding car-mounted guns, think Twisted Metal)- The world of CrackDown has some nice level design and areas both high (like skyscraper roof tops) and low (deep underground bunkers) are well though out and fun to traverse.- Access to Halo 3 Beta TestBAD:- No plot to speak of outside of being a super-cop and killing gang lords.- Game is short with only 24 bosses and 3 riots (gang riots happen in each area after all gang leaders are killing in that area).- Driving cars feels a bit sloppy even after getting 4 star max driving skills.- Outside of foot/driving races, looking for orbs (about 500 in the game), and killing bosses there is not too much to do in the world of CrackDown.- The Music in this title is not that great and over all forgettable - mostly generic techno (you only can get music while in a car, while on foot which you spend 90% of the game you get no music - like GTA). Thank god, using Xbox 360 built in \"\"play any song I want at anytime\"\" feature was here to save the day, just before you play a the game put in your favorite music CD, rip it onto the 360's Hard Drive and then later on while playing your game click the Xbox 360 guide button and go to select track (and play your own songs).IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-Fi (although near future feeling) Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player)- A go anywhere do anything at any time type of game that we have seen in such games as Grand Theft Auto. The biggest difference is now you play as a super-cop charged with killing criminals instead of a gang member trying to become a gang lord.- Jumping plays a big role in the game and jumping roof top to roof top (like the comedic super hero The Tick) is not only fun but opens up a large part of the game space available for play.- Co-op gameplay is fun and useful (2 players are able to do things one player could not do alone, example: One player gets into a car/truck and the other player can throw said car/truck well behind enemy lines)GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (PS2/Xbox/PC)- Saints Row (Xbox 360)- Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction (PS2/Xbox)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- The first shipments of CrackDown come with free access/invite to the Halo 3 beta (which starts 5/16/07 and ends 6/7/07); later releases will not have this feature.- You can download a character pack for this game for free over XBL Marketplace, this pack will add four new characters to your character select screen.- There are Two downloadable packs for this game on XBL Marketplace which unlock seven new achievements and an ability to reset gangs (but keep your level of stats), get a new new ground attack, a new noise indicator makes it easier to find orbs (when you get to the last 20 or so), makes stunt ring more visible, and fixes some minor problems with targeting and camera angles when driving. The first pack is called the Free-For-All Pack which is a FREE and has the Keys to the City Mode (where you will be able to spawn such items such as vehicles, explosive barrels and change time of day at any time. Your characters skill level can be changed to your likeing and you can turn on/off infinite ammunition as well as GOD mode, achievements and game saving is turned off when in the Keys to the City Mode), a new vehicle selection system has been integrated into the agency garage which allows for new colors (such as Blue, Red and Green) for all cars even agency cars and now players can impound any civilian or enemy vehicle and store them in the agency garage as well. The Getting Busy Bonus Pack which sells for 800 Microsoft points ($10.00 USD) has three new vehicles such as the Beach Buggy (with Chain gun), Race Car (Which looks like a wacky go-kart, but is fast), and Armored Car (Looks like the Mini-Tank/Armored Car from the 80's Aliens [Alien 2] movie), This pack also has some new game types (like Stockpile and Rocket Tag) and even has five new weapons such as the Muilt-Grenade launcher, Proximity Mines, Harpoon Gun, Chain Gun, and even a Cloaking Device.\"", "Being a somewhat older game for the Xbox 360 the popularity of this game has greatly diminished, despite that is a really an interesting twist on the sandbox genre. This GTA derivative puts you on the right side of the law. You are a genetically engineered supercop fighting the gangs within the city and your job is to rid the city of these gangs and their kingpins.As you go through the game getting kills your character levels up so to speak. You are able to level up your strength, agility, weapons skill, driving ability and explosives. Each one has its own distinctive advantage. With strength you are able to eventually pick up cars and even larger trucks. Agility allows you to scale buildings and jump very far. Weapons skill makes you more accurate and produces more damage. Driving ability gives you better control of the cars and even allows controlling of the car in midair. Explosives give you more powerful explosions.This is a pretty fun game as are most sandbox games, because they give you ultimate freedom and the ability to just roam the city looking for things. There are three main ways to play the game. You can go around playing the missions and fighting the gangs. You can roam the streets looking for agility orbs on the tops of buildings and the hidden orbs which level up all the abilities. The third way to play the game is just kill anyone and everyone you want, gang members and citizens alike. The problem with this is the peacekeepers (fellow cops) will start hunting you down if you go this route. More importantly you will lose the skills you have gained.My favorite parts of the game include: the superhuman abilities, which is quite a twist, the graphics while being cell shaded are pretty remarkable, and the fact that you can get to any part of the city whenever you want, no waiting until you've gotten to a certain mission. The best part of the game is unlike some of the newer hyped up big production games, this game is inherently fun. There is also a great depth to the city.Unfortunately, the like many of the other GTA clones this one also lacks a few key components that will always keep GTA on top in terms of depth. First of all, there are only cars (or trucks) that can be driven in the game. There aren't even any motorcycles or boats, which made me just want to run around instead of even bothering with a car and hitting pedestrians. Secondly, the game as I said before doesn't have a whole lot of side quests. Aside from hunting down gang members, you can look for agility orbs, hidden orbs or do the races. Other than that the game can be a little repetitive.After you level up all your skills, there isn't a whole lot to do at all. This is the curse of the sandbox genre. It is kind of like an illegal drug. It is immensely fun and exciting for a while, but then once the high is over, you feel unfulfilled. As was the case with this game I didn't want to have anything to do with it after playing through once. This game in particular lacked customization. There is no money involved at all. There is no garage to keep cars you own/stole. When it comes down to it, you own nothing in the game and you can't change your appearance or clothing. However, the game is just downright fun if you let loose, not caring about running over people or accidental friendly fire. Like very few new games these days it has the fun factor. I'd say I probably got a good 40 hours of playtime without getting every orb. In fact I spent over an hour just driving around at 150 mph in the agency supercar. Overall a good game worth buying--7/10.", "\"Well, I don't care about Halo, I had been waiting for this game for awhile due to all the stories of how great it would be. Well, I got the demo on XBL as soon as it came out, wasn't that impressed, and deleted it to save space(the demo is 1.2gb and my 360 drive is maybe half full because I have some arcade stff, etc). I spent a couple of weeks thinking about if I should buy the full game or not, then thought, what the heck if I don't like it better it should be easy to trade in for the Halo beta, so I picked it up.First thing, I have to say is, I'm so tired of everyone comparing every non linear game to GTA. Sandbox blah blah GTA clone yada yada it gets so old. If I see the word \"\"sandbox\"\" again I think i'm going to scream. The GTA games are unique and trendsetting; games that came after them might employ some of their attributes but just because they do, that doesn't make them \"\"GTA Clones\"\" or \"\"GTA ripoffs\"\" Oy that makes me crazy.Now then, where was I? Oh yeah, Crackdown..as most other reviewers stated, the most fun is actually jumping around trying to find all the power up orbs whatever they're called. I haven't really worked on eliminating the gangs yet, don't really know any of the areas too well, but like someone else said, its really not worth the effort, to use vehicles and spend all the time driving around the big map, when you can teleport from station to station.Last thing I don't like-it frowns on you killing innocents, one of my favorite things to do in a game (I'm evil). One of the most violent, gory games of all times, Soldier of Fortune II, was, IMO, totally spoiled in that you were not allowed to kill bystanders-if you did you failed the mission. Bah!\"", "This game is just all around cheesy from the story line to the game play, the objectives are not clear, and there are just mobs of enemies every where but you just don't really get any sense of satisfaction from completing missions they just don't feel like they have any deep meaning. I could not believe that they are actually making a second one after this one has bombed so much.", "I found this to be an interesting game in the sense that it reminded me of the game Mercenaries and GTA3 in the sense that it is free roaming while also having elements of mission-based combat. The jumping is insane and with the first powerboost you feel like a superhero and invulnerable to anything as pedestrian as a rapid succession of bullets, but then you are quickly humbled be the firepower of a gang hitsquad. Yes you have to take cover, yes you will probably die a few times taking on odds that are not in your favor. I found it easier just go around kicking the gang members instead of shooting them. When your strength rises to the level where you can pick up a truck and throw it a few yards, punching and kicking adversaries turns into comic slapstick what with the Havoc-ragdoll physics at work. The city-scape is amazing and has the endless feel. The city seems more South American to Eastern European. The citzens don't really interact, they aren't mindless though, they run when bullets start flying. The gangs are not too dumb, especially as you advance in stats, the gangs actually get more sophisticated and deadly weaponry to deal with your enhanced genetics. Sometimes just rushing the main bosses and smacking them down does more than ducking and shooting at them. I don't agree that this is a Saints Row knock off. The graphics are next gen and the game is geniunely fun to play especially on-line which is where the game seems to shine the most. It's definitely worth the buy!", "- The game has no story at all- Every boss battle is pretty much the same- The gameplay gets repetitiveYet the game is pretty fun to play overall. Crackdown is not a game you want to play for multiple hours straight because the gameplay is always the same. So playing in spurts keeps the game fun & less  frustrating.BasicallyyYou go to a boss location take on swarms & repeat. However there are some nice things that keep the game fun. For example you can work to uprgade your character.  Its a open world game where you can do anything you want. That means steal cars, blow things up, do races foot & car.+ Open World+ GTA type Freedom+ Upgrade character+ Action PackedAlso enemies respawn in swarms so gunplay can get tedious after a while. Like I said playing in spurts is best to keep the game enjoyable", "\"I just (2009) got Crackdown and Saint's Row, having already enjoyed all the current open-world/sandbox shooters. Though these two are about the same age, Crackdown has held up MUCH better and is MUCH more enjoyable.I've read reviews saying Crackdown is too easy and others saying it is too hard. In terms of completing missions/quests, it does seem harder thanBioShock(my all-time favorite shooter),Fallout 3(my 2nd all-time favorite), andMass Effect, but easier thanGrand Theft Auto IV(with which it has virtually nothing in common). It is nowhere near as hard as non-sandbox shooters such as Halo 3 or even Eat Lead. Climbing buildings and jumping between them to get the \"\"agility orbs\"\" is a lot of fun and nowhere near as difficult as in the latestPrince of Persia.I gave this 5 stars for fun and 3 stars overall because although it is plenty of fun to play, it does not compare to the previously mentioned more recent games when it comes to graphics (good but not great), variety, nor richness of environment and gameplay, but if you have already played the other games to death, Crackdown is a fun, cheap game to play while waiting for Bioshock 2 or Fallout 4 or GTA5 or whatever the next big sandbox game turns out to be.\"", "\"I have mixed feelings about this title. There are some elements that are designed well, while others fall flat. Since this game was developed from the original GTA designer, I expected a little more. \"\"Saint's Row\"\", while not as good as any GTA game, was still an impressive production, and is also a far more complete sandbox experience than \"\"Crackdown\"\". I still recommend playing the game, but make sure you either rent it or purchase it for a bargain price as others have recommended. For the potential buyer, listed below are the pros and cons:Graphics - Although some may be turned off from the cell-shaded graphics, they were designed well from an artistic standpoint. I felt I was engaged in a \"\"live comic book\"\" and from an atmospheric standpoint, I felt I was in a GTA game. It's truly the only reason why I still recommend playing the game. Another good thing was that there was never a load point past the initial load. The frame rate almost never dropped even with lots of non-player characters present and multiple explosions.  The explosions themselves were awesome and draw-in for distant objects was almost non-existent. With that said the vehicle models left little to be desired.Sound - Explosions, weapons, and overly dramatic narrator were cool. However, sound tracks are weak. I didn't recognize a single artist, and that would be ok if the music was actually good. Sound tracks is where GTA titles shine, even with their budget flicks, like \"\"Vice City Stories\"\" for PS2. Also, vehicle sounds were dismal.Game-play - This is a real mixed bag. The RPG-like ability enhancement function was comparable to \"\"GTA-San Andreas\"\", and that's a good thing. Weapon and melee control was also an improvement from GTA titles. The superhero abilities were great. However, I gave up on trying to drive anywhere in the \"\"game-scape\"\". The vehicles were designed horribly in every aforementioned category, and especially from a controls perspective. In any event, once your agility skills were ramped up, driving becomes moot because you can leap from building to building without the hindrance of sticking to the roads (like everyone's dream when stuck in traffic). Also, almost every mission has the same recipe: Find the boss's location, find a way to the get the top level where he/she is most likely hiding, while slaughtering legions of dumb NPCs along the way. Next, melee attack the boss and defeat them in under 15 seconds. Also, side missions are virtually non-existent, and what is  there is unimaginative. That stinks since there are less than 30 core missions.A special note: Game Save Functionality - I can't believe in the \"\"Next-Gen\"\" world with hard drives adequately saving endless save files, why most games don't have a \"\"save-at any-point/time\"\" functionality (the old XBOX had that for several games, BTW). While \"\"Crackdown\"\" improves game save functionality by saving every detail in real-time for ability progression, intra-mission saves were mysteriously left out. Therefore, you will be \"\"rinsing & repeating\"\" several iterative motions to get to the boss if you die along the way. I didn't mind that with a game like \"\"Ninja Gaiden Black\"\" because learning to perfect all the moves becomes instrumental during later game-play, and the controls were mega tight with no equal. However, for \"\"Crackdown\"\" which doesn't exactly have the state-of-the-art \"\"Ninja Gaiden-like\"\" game-play, the iterative motions are uninspiring  and take away from the overall experience.\"", "This would have been an OK game for the XBOX, but for the 360 it's very weak - the settings, graphics, etc. are all 90'sIf Halo is a 5, this is a 2. Save your money.", "\"The only reason most people bought this game was for the Halo 3 beta.  That is the simple bottom line in this game.  The game itself is too easy and you can bypass too much of it.  There is something to be said for \"\"open world\"\" games, but this takes it to the extremes.  You literally do not have to do anything except kill the bosses.  How lame is that?  Games are being pushed out the door without any imput form true gamers.  That has been a problem with the industry for years.  This, unfortunately is no exception.  Maybe a sequel can save this game from itself.\"", "\"First, here is the positive part to Crackdown.  I think Crackdown is a fun game to play.  It is very entertaining and the game will keep you occupied for hours.  In the game, you not only fight street gangs and gang leaders, but you also participate in different street races and try to find different colored orbs to build up your strength and skills.  You become faster at running, you can jump higher, and you can shoot weapons better.Okay, here is the negative part to Crackdown.  First off, it feels like the game developers rush through to try to finish this game.  The game feels like it is half finished.For example, the city you play in is divided up on different islands.  The city is called Pacific City.  So you are surrounded by water.  Well here is the weird part.  There are no boats anywhere out on the water.  You are surrounded by water but there are no boats.  You have beaches on the islands but there are no people sitting on the beaches or swimming out in the water.  There are factories in the game but there are no railroad tracks so there are no trains.  I have never seen a factory area without railroad tracks and trains.  There are no airports so there are no planes or helicopters up in the sky.  Where are the motorcycles in the game?You have a Amusement Park in the game called \"\"Fun Land\"\" that located on a beach.  I noticed when I went to Fun Land that are no people at the Amusement Park.  Well how come there are no people at Fun Land?  Every time I go there to Fun Land, I can't find one person there.  It doesn't matter if it is day or night.  And how come there is only one ride there?  You have a big Ferris Wheel and that's it.  The Ferris Wheel doesn't even work.  And how come none of the Snack Bars at Fun Land are ever opened for business?Most buildings in the game you can never go inside.  They are just there for looks and that's it. I don't know why people even bother comparing this game to the \"\"Grand Theft Auto\"\" series because it's not.  The Grand Theft Auto series games all had planes, boats, trains, motocycles, etc.  You could go inside most buildings in the Grand Theft Auto Series.I listen to all the songs in the game.  There are 105 songs you can listen to while you are driving around in a vehicle.  I notice right away none of the songs are popular songs.  All the songs are sort of rap songs I've never even heard of.  Why didn't they put in some country music, new age, rock and roll, contemporary, etc. that people recognized?  In Grand Theft Auto Vice City one of the reasons the game was so popular was because of the music in the game.  They played all 1980's hit songs which really added to the game.  This music is pretty much forgettable in Crackdown.I like Crackdown, but it really frustrating when I could see Crackdown being a much better made game to play.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02032788284122944, 0.033790647983551025, 0.05786161869764328, 0.006961768493056297, 0.043843287974596024, 0.0566539503633976, 0.040928151458501816, 0.0007277157856151462, 0.05708732455968857, 0.01021663099527359, 0.06749171763658524, 0.036320675164461136, 0.0031796868424862623, 0.03180542215704918, 0.03836110979318619, 0.02940613403916359, 0.03952706232666969, 0.03674767538905144, 0.015650488436222076, 0.009470802731812, 0.02000533789396286, 0.07122283428907394, 0.0004101828671991825, 0.05785813555121422, 0.04806915298104286, 0.01941000670194626, 0.019829988479614258, 0.0027762067038565874, 0.040615856647491455, 0.06462647020816803, 0.018816012889146805]]}
