I was a Genesis owner when I was a teen.  Many of my memories were good around many of these games and many are still timeless classics.  Playing several of these games has shown me that it's not graphics that make greatness but gameplay.  Games were still quite innovative in the early nineties and game making ideas were still fresh.  Game Developers now should take a clue from these creative giants about how to bring gameplay back to the game.", "\"Having recently purchased \"\"Sega Genesis Collections\"\", I can say that I haven't been this pleased with a $19.99 game in a long, long time. As the title of this review indicates, this collection would have been worthwhile if it only included Phantasy Star II, II and IV, all of which are good (although II shows its age significantly). However, there are 28 other games present here. A reviewer above had given his opinion of the games; I think I'll give mine as well:Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle:I'm stunned that this character got so many Sega games - I find this game incredibly annoying. Controls (as is the case for many genesis games) are incredibly dicey, and the game itself seems rather insipid (rock, paper, scissors? I'll pass). It's fin for a moment, but like arcade hits of the past, quickly loses its charm.Altered Beast:The cheese factor alone makes this a fun game. Some of the worst voices ever to grace a video game. This game is so-so, but nothing to write home abou (the arcade version, which can be unlocked after a painful ordeal, is much better).Bonanza Bros:I don't get this one at all. Terribly unsatisfying - I feel for the schmoes who paid big bucks for this in the 90's.Columns:Decent Tetris knockoff, but gets difficult quickly. The 2-player versus is a lot of fun, though (although it's no \"\"Puzzle Fighter\"\"). I found this game incredibly frustrating after the first few levels.Comix Zone:One of the surprises of the set. A later Genesis game, you travel through comic panels fighting bad guys that you created while in the real world. Stylistically, it is incredibly nice. The voices again are incredibly painful (particularly the \"\"See ya!\"\" spoken after defeating any character), but I found this one to be a hidden gem.Decap Attack:Another game I don't remember from back in the day, you play as a mummy attempting to thwart an evil underworld denizen. A pretty good game.Ecco the Dolphin:I liked this game when it came out, and I like it now. Although the undersea graphics aren't so impressive now, the game remains original and fun to play. Two of its sequels, present on the game, are also OK.Flicky:Platform game. I'm not a big fan of the genre in general, and this game did nothing to really make me one. It's cute saving your young chicks, but only OK overall.Gain Ground:Essentially, you run around shooting enemies and saving hostages. The fact that you can ultimately play as 20 different characters gives this game some interesting history, but it's not all that great.Golden Axe:Why is a sword fighter named Ax Battler? And why is \"\"ax\"\" spelled two different ways in the game? I'm sure scholars will ponder these questions for eons. As for the game, Golden Ax is incredibly frustrating now (depth issues of which the AI is a master is the main foe) - at the time, I accepted bad controls as part of the game. There is significant improvement in the sequels, however (GA 2 and 3 are also present).Kid Chamelion:I found this game to be kind of charming. An obvious Mario knockoff, you play as a kid in a virtual world, who can...that's right...hit blocks with his head to acquire helmets that will give him new powers, while hopping and bopping enemies. It pales in comparison to Mario, mind you, but it's got its moments.Phantasy Star:Is it Parma? Palma? I sure remember \"\"Palma\"\" from my youth, but \"\"Parma\"\" seems to be the name now. In any case, great games, WELL worth the price of admission. No, they're not as good as \"\"Final Fantasy\"\", and never were, despite the yelps from the games' fans. But nonetheless, these games had excellent stories, with great plot twists (even for today).Ristar:Fun little game where you play as a guy with a star for a head. Resembles \"\"Sonic\"\" too much to warrant exceptional praise, but it's a fun game.Shinobi:There are two \"\"Shinobi\"\" titles on this disc. \"\"Shadow Dancer\"\" stinks, in my opinion. \"\"Shinobi III\"\" is still a lot of fun.Sonic the Hedgehog:Oh yeah, THAT guy makes this collection, too. Both \"\"Sonic\"\" and \"\"Sonic 2\"\" are present here, and both remain excellent. My only gripe (which was the same as when the game was released) are the controls are too fidgety for such a high-speed game. But both games are still excellent to play.Super Thunder Blade:Going WAY back into the Genesis library(I didn't play this version, although I played the original arcade version), STB is an OK game (for an early 3-D shooter), but it's not my style.Sword of Vermillion:Ummm, well, this game is baffling to me. The game tells me that a 106-page hint book was included with the original release because \"\"Americans weren't used to RPG's\"\". Thank God all RPG's weren't like this one. Essentially, this game manages to mix all that was wrong with many of my favorite games (\"\"Ultima: Exodus\"\" comes to mind, as does the far less-well-known \"\"Dungeon Magic\"\"). This one is the stinker of the bunch.Vectorman:Late additions to the Genesis library, and both games were very good. The environments still look kind of trippy even today. I was happy to see these appear here.Virtua Fighter 2:Don't be fooled - this was a horrible port of a great game. Nothing about this game is VF2 other than the characters' names. Released near the end of the system's life, this game has \"\"We want money for a shoddy product\"\" written all over it.So that's my take. Happy gaming!\"", "I did not own a Genesis back in the day, I owned Nintendo stuff... so a lot of these games are new to me, with the exception of arcade experience.  (Note to those born around 1990 : Sonic and Mario didn't always star in the same video games!)What strikes me as impressive for this collection is that it contains a wide variety of material, so even if you absolutely hate a game or genre on this system, you are probably going to thoroughly enjoy others.  There are other fun things trying all these games out - seeing the difference between some of the earlier genesis games to the later ones.  Just look at the graphics with phantasy star 2 compared to phantasy star 4, for example.If you do not like spending the time and energy on RPGs, that is something to consider before buying this.  But, there is still plenty to enjoy ignoring the phantasy star collection, especially for a retail price of 20 bucks.Overall, the graphics and gameplay have held up well - these are mostly 16 bit games, so a jump ahead from NES fare.  And yes, true this is still not the definitive genesis collection, but the closest Sega has gotten, and once again, 20 dollars.  Strong Buy for those still playing on Playstation 2.", "This is a collection of Sega Genesis 16-bit console games. Sega Genesis made its debut in 1989 and the console came with the game Altered Beast. Some games still look pretty decent today with sharp and colorful graphics. There are 28 genesis games in this collection with 5 more unlockable. It baffles me that Sega don't make a true arcade collection.... or mix more arcade games in this collection and name it Sega Hits or whatever. This Genesis collection is much better than the horrendous Sega Classics Collection from last year.There are too many action platform games in this collection therefore most games have similar gameplay. Its sad that Streets of Rage, Space Harrier, Outrun and Revenge of Shinobi are not in this collection.Here are the games:Alex Kidd in The Enchanted Castle, 1989: A zany action/platformer, nice graphics. Good game.Altered Beast, 1989: The game that came with the original system, a mythological brawler. Great game.Bonanza Bros., 1991: Action/platformer, horrible game.Columns, 1990: A puzzle game similar to Tetris, horrible game.Comix Zone, 1995: A brawler/platform game, you go from 'box' to 'box' like reading a comic and beat up few enemies. Decent game.Decap Attack starring Chuck D. Head, 1991: A funny action/platformer starring a mummy. Decent game.Ecco the Dolphin, 1993: Action/adventure game. You are a swimming dolphin. Cool graphics. Decent game.Ecco The Tides of Time, 1994: Sequel to the game above.Ecco Jr, 1995: Sequel to above.Flicky, 1991: Another action/platformer. Similar to Joust with cute cartoony style. So so game.Gain Ground, 1991: A stupid action game. Horrible.Golden Axe, 1989: Medieval brawler. A popular arcade game back in the days. Okay graphics, good game. A real arcade version should've been included!Golden Axe II, 1991: Sequel to above.Golden Axe III, 1992: Third and worst of the series. So so game.Kid Chameleon, 1992: A fun action/platformer. You can transform into other forms like Altered Beast. Good game.Phantasy Star II, 1989: A role-playing game. Good game.Phantasy Star III, 1990: Sequel to above. Good Game.Phantasy Star IV, 1994: Sequel to above. Great game.Ristar, 1995: Another action/platformer. Good graphics, very colorful. Decent game.Shadow Dancer the secret of Shinobi, 1990: A ninja action/platformer. So so game.Shinobi III return of the ninja master, 1993: Much better than Shadow Dancer. Good game.Sonic the Hedgehog, 1991: Adenture/platformer. A roller coaster Super Mario type game. Good graphics. Good game.Soinc the Hedgehog 2, 1992: Sequel to above. Good game.Super Thunder Blade, 1989: A into-the-screen shooter similar to Space Harrier, you fly a helicopter. Horrible graphics, choppy gameplay, Chop Lifter would've been better. Horrible game.Sword of Vermilion, 1990: A role-playing game. No comment.Vectorman, 1995: A cool action/platform/shooter. Good game.Vectorman 2, 1996: Sequel to above. Good game.Virtua Fighter 2, 1996: One on one fighting game similar to Street Fighter. Horrible game.Bonus unlockable games: Altered Beast Arcade game.Other unlockable games: Future Spy, Tac/Scan, Zaxxon, and Zektor.Other bonus: Phantasy Star Universe and Virtua Fighter 5 trailers.Overall a good game for Genesis and classic game fans. Definately not as good as Capcom Classics 1 and 2.", "If you buy this game for other reasons than owning a copy of Phantasy Star II, III, and IV, you bought it for the wrong reasons.  I had some fun with Gain Ground, but the Sword of Vermilion is terrible.  The Golden Axe games are OK, and I liked Flicky (but the music got on my nerves).  Comix Zone looked neat, but was really hard (and you can't continue).  I gave up.  The others didn't impress me enough to mention (not my tastes).Overall,Taito Legends 2is a better compilation of games.  The reason to buy this in for Phantasy Star.That said, the game is still a lot of fun.", "I don't normally anticipate games but when I saw this, I checked the release date every day until I got the game. I grew up on Sega and this was the nostalgia I've waited so long for.The games: I know, it's a 7 GB DVD rom, they could fit more games on it. Also there are some games that are just crap.... BUT the inclusions of of phantasy star 2-4 are worth the price alone. Also the Gain Ground is an amazing game (don't be deterred by the graphics.)The bottom line is for 20 dollars, you'll have close AT LEAST 50 hours of fun, especially the RPG fans out there.For those of you who don't know, Phantasy Star is Sega's Final Fantasy....", "I was always a Nintendo fan, ever since the NES days.But after buying Sega Genesis Collection for the PS2, I'm totally amazed by the numberof fun games on thisdvd. My faves are the 2 Shinobi games,a side scroller Ninja game, Sonic, Phantasy Star 2,3, and 4, and the Golden Axe series. The other games are fun as well, more than worth the $[...] price for this dvd. Go back in time when the NES and Sega Genesis were battling for home video game supremacy. Well worth the money.", "There's a steady list of classic compilation games coming out these days, and the Sega Genesis Collection brings nearly thirty classic Genesis games to the PS2, and they all look, sound, and play like their original, 16-bit counterparts.  Many of the games here we haven't seen on previous Sega compilations, like Alex Kidd, Bonanza Bros., Shadow Dancer, Ristar, Decap Attack, Sword of Vermillion, Super Thunder Blade, and Shinobi 3 to go along with faves like Sonic 1 & 2, the Golden Axe trilogy, Comix Zone, Altered Beast, Flicky, the Ecco trilogy, and the Phantasy Star games, which thankfully includes the overlooked classic Phantasy Star IV, which along with II and III, is worth the price of admission alone.  Vectorman 1 & 2 are here as well, and so is the Genesis version of Virtua Fighter 2, which is the only real weak spot of the compilation as it is just as muddy, slow, and buggy as it was when released on the Genesis years ago.  There's a good amount of extras as well, including many interviews with developers, and unlockable games like the arcade version of Altered Beast and Zaxxon.  Sadly though, some games which longtime fans may have wanted to see here, like the Streets of Rage trilogy, Revenge of Shinobi, Shining in the Darkness, Shining Force, Landstalker, and Eternal Champions would have been more than welcome, although many of them are available on previous compilations.  All in all, the Sega Genesis Collection is a wonderful compilation of some of the best Genesis games ever, and for longtime fans of the classic console, this is a must have.", "As someone who has most of these games in it's original cartridge format,let me just say this compilation is amazing.The Golden Axe series, The Shinobis and Vectorman series alone make thisa must have !! And who can say no to Altered Beast?!The sound is crisp and the graphics nice and clean.PS2 over component cables and optical beat Genesis over compositeany day! and the fact that you can choose to run it in Progressive Scan and resize the pic is awesome too!order this now !", "This game caught me by suprise. I saw it in the store, checked out the back and I ended up purchasing the game later on. I figured it was going to be one of the old school collection games that has mostly garbage with a few good games strung in there. I couldn't be more wrong... this is mostly amazing games with a few not-so-great hits strung in there.Once I got this game home I decided to pop this game into the PS2 and see what was on the disk. I was amazed to see so many games - but not only that... I was amazed to see so many GOOD games. These are the games I used to play as a kid. I recognized quite a few of them.My favorite games on the disk are Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Decap Attack, Golden Axe Series (I, II and III), Phantasy Star II, III and IV. Sonic The Hedgehog 1 and 2, Shinobi III, Vectorman 1 and 2. That's a total of 14 games that I absolutely loved as a kid and still love to this day. The other games in this collection are good too, such as the Ecco series, Comix and a few others... most of the other ones are games I haven't played before (except Super Thunder Blade... but that game is a bit iffy in my opinion). Another reviewer here provides a good breakdown of all of the games in this collection.The biggest suprise was the Phantasy Star series. You get II, III and IV!! Phantasy Star IV is considered by many to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Just this series is worth the measley $20.00 price tag. There are hundreds of hours of nostalgic gameplay in this collection. All games are emulated very well and look fantastic.If you are looking for a great collection of old-school games then look no further. It's hard to beat this package. With so many great games in here you are sure to be playing with this collection for hundreds of hours. If you aren't familiar with any of these games then I still urge you to pick this up. A lot of games in this series have stood the test of time and are still very fun - even by todays standards."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00857662595808506, 0.0582830049097538, 0.23664934933185577, 0.06387733668088913, 0.09238863736391068, 0.12252277880907059, 0.17465262115001678, 0.10120561718940735, 0.0610143207013607, 0.078409343957901, 0.0024203432258218527]]}
