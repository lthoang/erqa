So, I bought some quality snaps for the strap, and put these loop connectors on my camera -- and the combo is working great.  The only complaint is that, as could be foreseen, the loops tend to be a nuisance just hanging/flopping around when the strap is not connected to them.", "I got these loops along withOP/TECH USA Swivel Hook Connectorand anOP/TECH USA Pro Strap - Blackbecause I wanted something that was comfortable and could also be easily removed from the camera. I don't like to have a strap permanently connected to my camera body, and this turned out to be a great setup to solve this problem.These loops are very strong and well made. The material and stitching is top notch. I trust them to hold my camera and a large lens without any problems.Fitting them through the hooks on my Canon T5i body was a bit tricky, it's a very tight squeeze. I folded the end of the loop and just pushed it through until there was enough to grab from the other side, then pulled it through. Using dental floss or some strong thread to pull it through is probably a better idea and will save you some time and frustration.I also purchased a set ofOP/TECH USA System Connector Adapt-Itswhich are a small plastic piece that essentially has the same function as this product. I much prefer this product because the fabric allows these loops to bend out of the way. I found the plastic Adapt-Its to be a bit too close to the main power/mode dial on my Canon camera, and being inflexible there's no way to move them aside.These loops are the way to go in my book, I am going to order a second set and won't be using the Adapt-Its.Overall I am very happy with all the OP/TECH products I purchased and not have a very comfortable strap that can be quickly and easily removed. I hope this company continues to come up with innovative products like this.", "Great addition to your OP/TECH camera strap or any other clip that will fit through. It was a tight fit through the loop on my Canon 5D MkII but it just takes a little maneuvering.", "I use this on my Canon DSLR as a safety strap connector. while I love using my BlackRapid primary camera strap (attaches to the camera tripod adapter), I alway worry about it coming lose and dropping my expensive camera & lens. I simply use a BlackRapid wrist strap in combo with this loop connector to provide that added protection and still maintain the simplicity of the BlackRapid strap system.", "I have these fitted to all my DSLR's to allow me to swap around my shoulder strap or use with the safety strap on my Cotton Carrier. Zero fears or concerns even with heavy loads on it (1D MKIII with a 70-200mm MKII) - about all the weight your likely to walk around and hand hold!Great idea and zero problems!", "Seeing the photos here on Amazon doesn't give an appreciation for how sturdy these are. The webbed nylon is very thick. So thick that I needed a screwdriver to push it through the strap hole on the 5D Mark III. Once it's in, it makes a very solid loop, and the hole in the plastic end is the exact right size for a small carabiner.", "I needed a connector to help attach my DIY r-strap to my D90's camera strap lug.  I don't like the idea of hanging my camera by the tripod lug so the utility loop provided the best solution to attach my strap.  It is well built and I have no fear of it falling apart or releasing my camera."], "Gamma": [0.04640254005789757, 0.04613601788878441, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.046403247863054276, 0.046953458338975906, 0.046403247863054276, 0.04638802632689476, 0.046390507370233536, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.046403247863054276, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.04640289768576622, 0.046403247863054276, 0.07168456166982651], "Beta": [[0.27950629591941833, 0.34987592697143555, 0.002732781460508704, 0.3050457537174225, 0.04784524813294411, 0.009694540873169899, 0.0052994186989963055], [0.2794904410839081, 0.34983381628990173, 0.002740495838224888, 0.3049650192260742, 0.04795428737998009, 0.009702850133180618, 0.005313085857778788], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795064449310303, 0.3498761057853699, 0.0027327570132911205, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694511070847511, 0.005299401469528675], [0.2794645130634308, 0.3498800992965698, 0.0026921345852315426, 0.3050779700279236, 0.04781969636678696, 0.009743002243340015, 0.005322560667991638], [0.2795063555240631, 0.34987616539001465, 0.002732740482315421, 0.3050457239151001, 0.04784510284662247, 0.009694528765976429, 0.005299407057464123], [0.2795007824897766, 0.3498566150665283, 0.0027336576022207737, 0.30504968762397766, 0.047857217490673065, 0.009699697606265545, 0.005302364006638527], [0.2794766128063202, 0.3498147428035736, 0.002734965179115534, 0.3050718903541565, 0.04788341745734215, 0.00971005018800497, 0.0053082737140357494], [0.27950650453567505, 0.34987619519233704, 0.002732747234404087, 0.30504554510116577, 0.04784509912133217, 0.00969450268894434, 0.00529939541593194], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063555240631, 0.34987616539001465, 0.002732731169089675, 0.3050456643104553, 0.047845110297203064, 0.009694547392427921, 0.0052994173020124435], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795063853263855, 0.34987613558769226, 0.0027327740099281073, 0.3050456643104553, 0.04784511402249336, 0.009694485925137997, 0.005299388896673918], [0.2795069217681885, 0.3498762249946594, 0.002732658525928855, 0.3050451874732971, 0.047845058143138885, 0.0096945371478796, 0.005299407988786697], [0.2769925892353058, 0.3495086133480072, 0.001281615230254829, 0.30640459060668945, 0.046634189784526825, 0.012537602335214615, 0.0066407895646989346]]}
