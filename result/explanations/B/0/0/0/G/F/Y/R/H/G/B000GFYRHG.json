Bigelow's chai doesn't have any harsh standouts, and results in the unique even taste I liked about the expensive coffee shop tea.  On top of being my favorite strictly by taste, it's also one of the cheapest brands on the shelf.Two handy features:- Each bag is inside its own envelope.  It's nice to be able to transport one or two bags without having to touch them directly with dirty hands.  Other brands leave the individal bags naked and have a nice sealed liner in the box, which is really handy if you plan on wandering around with an ENTIRE BOX OF TEA.- Each bag has a dipping string/tab attached to remove the bag from your cup.

It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings' \"\"Vanilla Hazelnut\"\", but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor. It also has a very strong caramel type smell.Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor, this particular tea does not \"\"pass muster\"\". My first thought upon smelling this was \"\"does this have chicory in it?\"\" It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above, but chicory is more likely. It should not be advertised as chai.Currently I brew two different chais together (Tazo and India Tea's Cardemom Chai) together. After that I  put the seeds of two cardamom pods, one star anise, a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey. I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order. I'll keep this, but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on!This tea also seems very sweet. I don't know if they added Stevia or something similar, but I didn't need to add as much sweetener as I add to my other Chai concoction.\"", "How nice to have my tea delivered to my door. At the market I can get this price on sale, about twice a year... but I have to go get it. This a great price for a really nice tea and wonderful service.", "I love peach tea (and anything peach flavored), but this has has a cinnamon flavor that is too strong. I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I did. I don't like the cinnamon flavor. To me, peach and cinnamon don't belong together. Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter. This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea, but then again, not, because peach is too summery. Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor. As soon as I finish this box, I will not buy it again.The cinnamon is way too strong.  It made me sick at my stomach, and the aftertaste is horrible.", "I live in Atlanta and while most don't think of the winter here as harsh, I was born over 500 miles south so its practically the arctic to me. Since moving here I have used hot tea as a winter comfort. For years I drankTwinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)which was strong and had lots of flavor but left a slight metallic aftertaste. I stumbled onTwinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)and for awhile, this strong tea with less of a metallic aftertaste was my favorite. But my wife brought home this Vanilla Chai tea and I think I have found my all time favorite. It is a traditional back tea with vanilla and other spices that added together are out of this world. I perfer it to the herbal teas I have tried because it has that underlying true black tea taste. I drink it with half and half, it has so much flavor it doesn't need sweetening although traditional chai teas are served very sweet. Try this tea and see what you have been missing!", "A good assortment of tea.  Apparently the description has been corrected since the other reviewer posted.  These are decent teas of good quality at a fair price.  Good for when you're in the mood for something different.", "\"Bigelow Green Tea is available everywhere in American supermarkets, but it's just not a very good green tea. It produces an amber-colored brew that lacks the crisp tannin flavors that should be in quality green tea. With the prominent drawing of Mount Fuji and distinctive Shinto torii (Itsukushima, a UNESCO world heritage site) on the box, you might think this is Japanese green tea. It is not. No information is listed on where it is grown, except that it is \"\"packaged and blended in the USA\"\".Green tea is very good for health because of the abundance of catechins and flavinoids (antioxidant compounds) and has half the caffeine of black tea. Good Japanese green tea produces tea that is clear pale yellow-green, or very dark green, depending on the tea grade. These helpful chemicals, however, get mostly destroyed during roasting. Catechins are also responsible for the bright aroma and astringent taste of green tea, which is lacking in this product. With its brown leaf particles (see my photo comparison in gallery) and resulting brown liquid, Bigelow is more like hojicha, a roasted green tea. The flavor is very thin and I have to use 2 bags per cup of tea.A much better quality tea isKirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend, 100% Japanese Tea Leaves, which is surprisingly good for a tea sold in non-specialty supermarkets. It is made by Ito-En, one of Japan's biggest beverage makers. I first heard about it because it is the tea used by staff at the Japanese Embassy in DC.As for directions, the ideal temperature for green tea 70-80C, NOT boiling (100C) as the product description recommends. Sugar is seldom added to green tea, though it is frequently enjoyed cold.\"", "I've haven't purchased Constant Comment for years because I got on a green tea kick.  However, when my spouse decided to switch from drinking soda to iced tea (and then complained about my green tea selection), I remembered how much I had enjoyed Constant Comment.Constant Comment was my mother's favorite tea, and is a black tea blend with a hint of orange & spice.  Drinking it hot & iced brings back old childhood memories, and tastes just like I remembered.  It has a good, robust flavor that isn't harsh.Constant Comment makes a great iced tea because the strength of the black tea & the spice will hold up to the watering down from the ice.  Enjoy!", "This is a pretty decent tea.  No, it isn't PG Tips or even Tetley's British Blend, but it does have a full-bodied flavor and can stand up to milk if you let it steep long enough.  I use my Keurig to pour the hot water over the teabag in the cup and that works wonderfully on speeding up the brewing process.  It isn't bitter, but not overly strong either.  I still prefer the British blends but when they're not on sale, this is the one I buy.  Recommend!", "As other reviewers have said, this tea is not quite as strong as other black teas. While I do enjoy a very strong cup of tea much of the time, when I'm looking for a mellower black tea with a rich flavor, this Darjeeling is one of the first I turn to. This tea doesn't tend to get much of the bitter flavor that some teas will have when it has steeped a bit longer than it should, and it generally just tastes great. I highly recommend it.", "Prior to sampling this tea, my favorite Chai (and I've tried lots and lots) was the Tazo Organic Chai.  I still like the Tazo, but for some odd reason it has started to give me heartburn on occasion, so I found this Bigelow tea at Target and decided to give it a try.Wow!  Yummers is all I have to say!  It is quite similar to the chai latte I get at Panera when I heat the water with a bit of milk, steep, and then add some agave sweetener.An excellent tea...wish there weren't any artificial flavors in it though(the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars).", "If you like the original, you'll like this fruity flavorful tea in the green version. And if green is truly healthier, well then it just gets better.", "\"I absolutely LOVE Bigelow's spiced chai tea.  It's the best brand on the market, and along with their vanilla chai, form 2 of the 3 brands of chai I keep on hand (or will even TRY these days.)  Too many times, I've tried other brands, only to end up throwing them out because of dreadful medicinal tastes.  I also love the foil packet packaging inside the box--it makes Bigelow tea bags much more portable!  This is a tea that I hate running out of.I'm a camper, and frequently participate in outdoor activities.  I'm also usually the camp cook.  Bigelow teas are my favorite to keep in my drink box to offer everyone a selection of tea--the foil packages prevent taste transfer, help keep the bags clean and dry, and are clearly labeled as to the variety.  I feel comfortable adding Bigelow teas to our backpacks too--the teas will be usable whether they are used this trip...or six trips from now.  Convenient, fantastic flavor, high quality, and Amazon offers a much better price than our local stores.  I love the convenience of \"\"subscribe & save\"\" too!\"", "\"We get it by \"\"subscription\"\" and it usually runs out before the next box comes.It's a little bland and tends to be a \"\"sick day\"\" favorite.\"", "This is a light tea with a flavor of jasmine.  It's a rather delicate green tea and is very refreshing.  Very good tea for drinking with meals, snacks, or just by itself.", "After trying the Stash exotic blend of Jasmine tea I was hesitate to try this one thinking it may be inferior due to the price....imagine my surprise when it proved far superior to one that cost substantially more. A delightful flavor, very aromatic but yet natural. Does not come across harsh or artificial whatsoever. Soothing and so fragrant it makes the perfect time-out during a hectic afternoon or end-of-the day treat. No caffeine so great for use any time of the day or evening. Compares very favorably to Twinnings and Stash teas - far superior to Bentley.", "I am now receiving a case of this tea every six months - for a great price!  The tea is always fresh.  Packets are foil sealed and each cup consistently comes out with a nice cinnamon orange flavor.  It not only cuts the cold Colorado wind on a snowy day, it also tastes equally good iced in the summer time.  I don't know many people who haven't tried it.  It is just so mellow and soothing.  This is the only tea my teen daughter likes to drink when she is sick.  I think the cinnamon has a calming effect on her tummy.  It's not too spicy like some cinnamon teas.  Very nice blend of citrus and spice.", "Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my esophagus. Therefore I usually buy loose leaf as it is less processed, I can see and smell what I'm buying and I can better control the strength of my tea. I first tried this when I obtained a few complimentary bags.On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.For example, I've found that Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste, Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste, etc. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it. Update: Since I wrote this review, which is 5 years ago, I've often bought this brand and it tastes as good as ever.", "Black tea is full of antioxidants, and green tea even more so. Very likely because many consumers consider green tea a bit on the bland side, Bigelow decided to blend it with their flavorful, delicious, 70-year-old, all-star tea, Constant Comment. This tea is a terrific way to start the day. Green tea energizes without causing the jitters.Highly recommended.", "Where has this lemon tea been all my life? It's the exact lemon tea I've been looking for: a wonderful blend of citrusy tang from the lemon and lemongrass, with floral softness from the rosehips and hibiscus. I drink it straight -- no sugar, no honey, no milk -- and find the multiple flavors bright but not overpowering. My friend says that with milk and sugar it's delicious enough to feel indulgent while keeping her on her diet. It's also nice to add one bag when making iced tea to give that lemony flavor.Lots of people recommend drinking hot lemon water in the morning as a way to detox and jumpstart the metabolism. This tea is pretty much the same thing, with the added benefits of peppermint (stomach soothing), hibiscus (skin, respiratory and circulatory health), lemon verbena (stress, respiratory and depression) and lemon grass (pain relief, antioxidant, antifungal). I like, too, that each cup has 100% Vit C for the day. A delicious way to boost immunity to colds and flu all winter long!", "\"\"\"Plantation Mint\"\" recreates old traditional Southern USA fine, mellow, balanced black tea with cool spearmint to invigorate, refresh and soothe at any time. Good icy or hot. Good with or without cream or honey. With natural spearmint leaf added to good black tea leaf. With richly balanced tea and mint in individual sealed steeping bags. Healthful antioxidants from both the black tea and spearmint. Soothes even someones belly as well as attitude due to MELLOW spearmint known to do so -- such as versus ache, nausea, heartburn and indigestion. Not somewhat harsh like peppermint yet not somewhat bland like green tea. BALANCED indeed. Great virtue at a small price for this pack of six 20-count boxes. Bigelow and Amazon, thank you ever so kindly +++\"", "If you're looking for a tasty green tea, you might enjoy this Bigelow green tea with lemon.  I love the flavor of lemon in tea.  This has a light, pleasant lemony flavor which isn't overpowering. The tea is a wonderful afternoon or evening treat.  Green tea alone to me tastes the way hay smells--excuse me, we used to have a horse form and when I drink plain green tea I feel like I'm drinking horses brew.But this tea tastes like lemon and is delightful.  I was never a tea drinker but wanted to add green tea to all the other nutritious foods I'm eating and this is my favorite so far.  I want to try the decaf version of this green tea with lemon, also.Each tea bag comes individually wrapped with a string so the bag is easy for dipping. If you like lemon flavored tea, you should enjoy this version of it.", "I love this tea.  Vanilla flavors are some of my favorite type of tea and this one is my favorite of those.  The vanilla and caramel flavors blend really well.", "I am not a fan of plain green tea; as a matter of fact, it usually makes me want to gag. I wanted the health benefits that green tea brings so I thought I'd give Bigelow Constant Comment Green Tea a try & was glad I did.  This tea is wonderful!  Tastes almost like Bigelow Constant Comment (black tea) which I think has a slightly stronger flavor. I usually drink ice tea and this is no exception.  I love it iced. I steep 7-8 bags in a couple cups of  boiling water for 8-10 minutes, add enough cold water to make 1/2 gallon, ice & sugar to taste. It makes great tasting ice tea with a slightly spicy flavor & aroma. I have some green tea that needs to be used up so once in a while I'll substitute a couple of bags of green tea for the Constant Comment green tea.  It's a great way to use up the green tea (the green tea flavor is masked by the spicy flavor of the Constant Comment green tea).Trying to find this on the grocery shelves is hit or miss.  One day I decided to check Amazon & was surprised to find it.  Not only does Amazon.com sell it...but the price is great too! Much lower than the grocery store.YUM! I'm enjoying a glass right now!5 stars", "Bigelow is my favorite tea (constant comment!) and sometimes my local stores do not carry the decaffeinated flavors, so I checked here on amazon and found this variety pack.  LOVE this, I drink tea every day and now it can be mixed up and not the same old boring tea all day every day. All without the caffeine.", "Bigelow's Plantation Mint isn't just a tea. The moment you toss the bag in water and start to smell that intense aroma of fresh mint, you'll realize you've gotten not only a tea but an aromatherapy kit that'll have your whole house asking for their own cup.The tea itself is wonderful. You might not expect tea and mint to go this together, but they really do. The overall flavor that you get is a wonderful mouthful of mint flavor with just enough bitter tea to make it go down smooth. It really is a fantastic experience.If I had to come up with a downside, I'd say that the flavor is just a touch too syrupy. Anyone who's actually used fresh mint before will likely recognize this tea for what it is- an (excellent) mint syrup drizzled (deliciously) into a cup of tea. Basically, this is a really good approximation of mint infused tea, about as good as you could possibly expect from a bagged tea. For a product this wonderful you can't help but wonder what it would be like to have real leaves and brew them yourself. However, that's the trade-off you make for just being able to toss a bag in water and get your tea quickly. And having a tin of fresh leaves in this mix, you'd probably use it for the smell long before you considered drinking it anyway.In the end, this has instantly become my very favorite comfort tea. Especially if you're feeling a little under the weather, the smell solves a stuffy nose in no time. Definitely get a box and try this- maybe two boxes if you have other tea drinkers in the family, since they'll likely steal the first box for themselves.", "I'm addicted to Chai Tea's and was eager to try this vanilla variety.  Unfortunately, this variety is pretty weak in flavor.  I have a case of it now, and will drink it.  Honestly, I don't taste the vanilla.  I add milk and sugar like I always do, but I get with this variety is weak Chai tea.  I won't order this particular flavor again.", "If you are a tea snob, you know that Oolong isn't just another kind of tea--it's meant to be steeped multiple times, with fifteen and twenty second timings to bring out the layers of taste.A tea sommelier would also tell you that what's in tea bags is the 'fannings' or the dust from tea production, so you're not getting great tea from tea bags.  (And frankly, you don't drink champagne every day, either, so why be bothered by having less-than-perfect-tea?)Um, well...having had reasonably good loose Oolong in the recent past, I can tell you that this doesn't compare.  Good oolong, like the stuff Twinings sells in their Origins line, is a little like drinking grass in the initial steepings and then like drinking liquid teak, but it's not so bitter that it needs sweetener.This, on the other hand, is just bitter as a main taste.  I'm wondering if it's because Amazon's stock is old;  more oxidation might make this more bitter than it should be.Kudos to Bigelow for even trying to bring cheap Oolong to the masses--but if you really want to know what oolong is supposed to taste like, look elsewhere.", "We are both big tea drinkers.  This is is of the better teas we have tried.  Very flavorful not bitter at all.  I did not think it reminded me of the chinese tea of my childhood.  My wife did.  My wife pointed it that we use high quality reverse osmosis water, while the chinese restaurants use sink water.  On that basis alone, it wouldn't taste the same.Verdict  by both of us.  An excellent mild, but well flavored tea, with no bitter aftertaste.This and Bigelow's unflavored morning blends are now my favorite teas.", "Don't you just love when the nights turn a little colder in the fall. I enjoy getting into bed with a good book or my Kindle and a nice cup of spicy tea. This is a very mild tea with just a hint of spice and orange. It is not overpowering and is caffeine free. This tea contains rose hips, spices (tastes like cinnamon and cloves), hibiscus, orange peel, roasted chicory and natural orange flavors. Sip and enjoy.~The Rebecca Review", "\"I've always liked Bigelow teas. I've tried countless other brands but I always seem to keep coming back. Bigelow is not the most inexpensive tea available but there's a reason for it's consistently good quality and freshness. Extra money is well spent in packaging as each tea bag is individually wrapped in airtight foil pouches virtually guaranteeing the freshest possible brew one can get. By definition, many grocery item preferences are going to be subjective as individuals tastes differ. Popular consumer magazines may rate a given coffee or tea as a best buy or as the best in its class but there will be many people who think the alleged \"\"best\"\" is far from their favorite.One thing I think you can count on with Bigelow, and this differs from what one other reviewer said. That thing is consistency in flavor and strength. Over the years I've found Bigelow to have this consistency giving me, the consumer of always knowing that I'm going to get what I expect. I do not find it to be bitter at all, though with the competitor \"\"Twinings\"\" I do. I also like many of their other flavors, Orange Spice, Earl Grey, Constant Comment and their Organic Green decaf, though completely different than any black tea I find to be of high an consistent quality. I really like having their packaging and think it reflects a higher degree of quality than is to be found in boxes of tea bags that come packaged loose and must be put into zip lock bags to try to preserve freshness. Having to put tea bags in a zip lock bag to keep them fresh is inherently inferior to bags that are packaged such as these. As with many things, one may pay a little more for a product but in the case of tea, in this case I think the few extra pennies do provide the consumer with a value added product.\""], "Gamma":
