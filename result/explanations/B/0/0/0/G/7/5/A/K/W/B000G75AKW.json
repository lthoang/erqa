I felt like I needed two extra fingers on each hand in order to lock weapons onto a target while running the engines and flying the ship. The overly complicated controls make it harder to progress and unlock my favorite Star Trek series.", "This doesn't deserve the Star Trek name. The real tragedy is that with a bit more playtesting and polish this could have been a good game.  However, someone thought that frustrating, repetitive gameplay might be fun.On the good side, the game looks nice for a 5-year-old PS2 game. The ship-to-ship battles are actually fun in an arcadey kind of way, There are a good number of missions (20), and the skirmish mode is okay for a little while. The campaign story was all over the place and didn't make sense in some instances. But there was a good spread of enemies and missions over the various eras, and you get to fly the different Federation ships. I even liked the music, and they got William Shatner to narrate the mission intros.Now, the bad parts.  Where to start? Many of the missions are very frustrating.  Even the tutorial missions (yeah, the one with the rings) are super annoying. The average player will end up redoing some mission objectives dozens of times before successfully completing them. And generally it's the same kind of bad missions: fly through these rings, follow those warp trails, escort that weak ship, beat the timer, wash, rinse & repeat. It's just poor level design and really should not have passed the quality-control people at Besthesda.  The game becomes a chore really quickly, and I found that I could only take it in small doses before playing something else.  It's really a shame, since the Star Trek license should be a good starting point for coming up with decent games.  I really do hope that Bethesda has given up the license.  They have thoroughly abused it with games like Encounters and Star Trek: Legacy (Star Trek: Conquest is pretty good, though simplistic).One major warning: If you have an older PS2 like me, there is a good chance that you will not even be able to play this game out of the box. For some silly reason, the game is on a cd instead of a dvd. I got it to run by tweaking my PS2, which required opening it up and adjusting the spindel that controls the height of the disk.  There's a good guide at [...].  Ultimately, the game is not worth the effort.", "I was looking forward to playing Star Trek Encounters as you get to take control of all the series's ships, but the game is full of glitches at ever corner. The ships are hard to control and the graphics are only average at best. It can be fun if you can figure it out.", "I bought this game a few days ago and at first I was disappointed.  The graphics from the get-go are obviously pretty good, but the controls were very awkward for me.  I have never really played a game from this top-down 3D perspective before.  And then there are the famous rings...  All you have to do is two things.  One: as quickly as you can when you get control of your ship is to quickly transfer full power to the engines to acquire maximum speed from the starting point.  At the same time you need to be accelerating and steering the ship towards the first ring.  Two: you can not, I mean can not, miss any of the rings.  You have to stay accelerating the whole time.  If you stop or have to turn around to go through a ring you missed, chances are you will fail the mission and have to restart the rings over again.  In order to successfully accomplish those two points, you have to be used to the control scheme for steering and changing altitude on the fly (watch those little blue lines to see whether you need to raise or lower your altitude in order to pass through each ring successfully).  It only took me a handful of times to figure this out thank goodness.  But shortly after you get past the rings, you start fighting other enemy ships and let me tell you it's a blast!  The game went from kind-of boring and slightly frustrating to immediately fun to play! For the price I paid for this game, it looks well worth it.  I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it and I only recommend it for Star Trek fans.  It is a budget title after all and it shows.  It's not a real dramatic and intense game as far as music and cinematics go.  But the ship-to-ship battles are quite fun.  Keep in mind though that I have only just beaten the first mission in the Enterprise era.  I am only beginning but am looking forward to more missions.  I do agree with one of the reviews on here to take this game is small doses in order to not become overly frustrated.  Put it in, beat a mission, turn it off and change games.  Later on, rinse and repeat.  Also, others are right about ol' Shatner and his lack of enthusiasm when he read his lines.  He should have read his lines like he did in the original series when he played Captain Kirk.  It would have definitely made it more interesting to say the least. =)  Or as one suggested, have all the captains voice their own series.  Overall, this game is pretty good for the price...speaking from the perspective of a Trek fan.", "For the price, it is definitely worth getting. I'm a fan of Enterprise, so I wish they had more than three levels of it. It is really cool to see all of the ships we have grown to love in Trek appear on screen, especially to see the NX-01 make its video game debut! The game can also be challenging, which is good that it is not too easy. The controls are excellent. The flying controls are so smooth; it really does feel like the ship is flying. Shatner lends his voice at the beginnings of each level, which is pretty cool. Sadly, you can't skip the story if you lose which becomes just a little annoying if you lose a lot. Overall, this is definitely worth having if you have a PS2. For the price, it is really amazing and I'm really looking forward to Star Trek: Legacy on X-Box 360!", "I bought this game because I love Star Trek games and have only really been impressed with Star Trek: Invasion which came out for the PS1, I am glad that this game brings the game play and graphics up. If you loved Star Trek: Invasion then you should buy this game. Spanning many captains and many points in the Star Trek universe this game is awesome.", "\"Pros:- It's cheap.- Play with different ships from different eras.- Visuals and sound effects are decent for PS2. Explosions are quite satisfying.- Provides skirmish (instant action), story, and multiplayer modes.- A stripped down version of Starfleet Command where you can more easily:a. fire photon torpoedoes and phasers.b. drop mines.c. beam away teams to capture enemy ships.d. manage energy use between weapons, engines, sensors, etc.- I was dubious about this game being advertised as an \"\"arcade\"\" version of Starfleet Command. But I think they managed to simplify things sufficiently well so the balance came out right- ie it wasn't like playing a Xevious-like top-down shooter.Cons:- Story mode has some very very very very frustrating levels involving flying through rings with a time limit. It must have taken me 2 dozen tries to get through this and it is a miracle my game controller isn't now permanently lodged in my screen.- Just remember how much you paid for it vs how much work went into developing the game.\"", "ok i love star trek, i admit it ok lets move on shall we?.. ok then this game is Hard i am warning you all this is one toughie (unless you have a cheat device) controls are awkward but interesting. (ok ok review) you begin the game with the NX-01 yes archers ship and its not bad but the souvern class (think Enterprise E Alternate)  and wham bigtime fair sapce arcade style combat but until you are crafty enough to beat the whole game via a wide variety of episodes (star trek, Voyager, Next Generation, Enterprise, and a sprinkle of the movies plus Deep Space 9 and its unlockable and usable!) yes i agree somewhat with the other reviewers that yes the rings are Hard but not by any stretch impossible like most of them say. it just takes a little time and even more tolerance because you will miss one ring and have to redo the whole course ack! but it isnt impossible my friend picked up the controller not even a ps2 owner and beat the rings episode on the 5th try!  Spectacular Graphics, Wicked ship list to choose from from the old enterprise on through the borg romulans and even the E Alternate this is a Must Have for anyone out there that Enjoyed the Star Control Games!Pros: Great graphics, Tons of selectable ships, many episodes, alternate timeline plotCons: horrible Controls take Tons of getting used to either you will or will not. Must beat the game (or skirmish mode high score and enter the name 4jstudios and bing get it all) to unlock everything which can be painful and the save system leaves a bit to be desired control problems make this game lose 2 stars.", "\"This is a pretty fun game, I enjoyed running through the story missions that took a couple days. Skirmish modes are pretty fun if you ever wondered what would happen if the Enterprise-A had a battle against and unending onslaught of Borg ships and several other scenarios. The graphics look great even by todays standards although I find it more comparable to download only games but it's still not too big of a pain to look at.I was looking for a fun Trek game that let me command ships from the universe and it didn't disappoint in that respect. The only real problems I have with this game is the difficulty in switching weapons, and the somewhat wonky \"\"targeting slice\"\" mechanic but the problem with that may have been my old controller and not the game it's self, I'll update if I ever get a new controller or if Sony ever makes the PS3 backwards compatible for PS2 again. Another problem I had was the story mode, it's broken up into era's which is there way of not saying \"\"shows\"\" you play through a few missions of each shows particular ship in chronological order which of course means you have to start out with the craptacular NX-01 which was the biggest pain to command. I think it would have been better if they let you choose the era from the get go instead of making you play through them all just to get the Enterprise-E unlocked. When we're talking used game prices you could do far worse than this game if you're a Trek fan.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1299131214618683, 0.18207138776779175, 0.015437303110957146, 0.050014667212963104, 0.21929797530174255, 0.12728452682495117, 0.04892439395189285, 0.037685610353946686, 0.18937106430530548]]}
