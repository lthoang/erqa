I got my ps3 a few days ago, and it's the first shooter I played. I hope the next shooters I buy can keep pace!To begin with, the graphics are ok but not really amazing. However, the story line and in game videos will really draw you into the thick of things. You'll really want to defend your colleagues, even if you don't think so at first. The gameplay is engrossing, and the controls, while not great, are sufficient. You will get many opportunities to use the sixaxis feature of the controller, so in that sense, it's a great introduction.The elements of the game are comprehensive. You'll walk, run, drive, command tanks et al. I haven't even gotten to play the game on-line yet, so I won't review that feature, but expect it will be fun. My sole complaint is sometimes the AI leaves you to do a lot of the work, although you could just sit around and wait for them to do it. I might have to clear out a whole three story house with 16 Nazi's in it, my teammates will trail behind and shoot one or two of them.  This is where not being able to give commands hurts, but I understand that wouldn't fit the nature of the game. All in all, I put two thumbs high in the air for this one.", "Call of Duty 3 is the classic combat game of World War II. If you've seen Saving Private Ryan, you know what you're in for. Head-throbbing noise and death all around you.The game goes for instant immersion. You're barely off on your first trip when shells are landing, guns are hammering in your ears and there is complete chaos. You have to be careful not to hit a friendly while you're blasting away at the bad guys.  You can barely see what you're doing. Your friends drag you along when you're hurt, and the rain and smoke can blind you.Call of Duty 3 does a great job of giving you a WWII environment with character. You're in destroyed homes with cans on the shelves and holes blown into bedroom walls. You can see the smoke drifting across the main street, the plunks of rain as it falls through the boards. Bodies collapse realistically. The PS3's high def graphics really shine here.The controller also adds to the sense of immersion. When you want to whap someone in the head with your gun, you just give the controller a sharp twist. You also use the controller for other steering-related tasks as well.How about the sound? Playing the Call of Duty series always gives me a headache after a while :) But that's the point - war wasn't fun. It's not about cool pop soundtracks while you blow away the enemies. It's about listening carefully for footsteps in the silence, and then having your eardrums shatter when the barrage rains down on you.Gameplay is well done with multi-pathed missions that let you choose your objective, within the current mission's parameters. You can't just decide to turn around and head for Bermuda :).  Your leaders tell you what your group needs to do - but then it's up to you how to get it done.Even if you're an uber-soldier and whip through the main gameplay in a short period of time, there is still the online side, which can keep you going for *months*. The in-game play is only training for the real challenge, live human opponents.  Of course, if you don't like online gameplay, there is certainly a wealth of gameplay to replay for quite a while before you start to get bored.Highly recommended!", "This is one of the best Call of Duty games out there. Unfortunately, the public has had their fill of WW2 and for good readon. Now everyone is all about the modern warfare. But I'll tell you that this is much better then any Call of Duty game after MW2, Call of Duty has sure lost a lot of its luster after that. Overall,", "The single player isn't bad, but it was the chance to go war with other gamers online that convinced me to buy this game.  It was a big disappointment then when I found it nearly impossible to connect to an online game of any kind.  Motorstorm, Resistance, both work fine with my internet connect and router, but this game had some major compatibility issues.It doesn't affect everyone, but there are quite a few people with these problems, if the Playstation forums are any indication.  Fixing it may require tinkering with a number of router settings, or there may be no fix at all, depending on which version of the PS3 you have.Personally, I'll be exchanging this game as soon as I've beat the single player.  I could probably get it working with some time and effort, but really with several other high quality multiplayer games out there that don't have these issues, why bother?  If I have the urge for some online FPS carnage, guess I'll be going with Resistance for a while.And the next time an Activision game comes out, I'll definately be renting instead of buying first.", "I always say the two most important aspects in a game for me are graphics and gameplay. And this one excells in both!The combat is fast and intense. There is plenty of action and loads of weapons to try out. I say try out because whatever you start out with will run out of ammo and you'll eventually have to go back to using the German weapons. I almost always finished the levels using a German machine gun and rifle.One aspect that really really bugged me was how my teammates ALWAYS got in the way. I don't know how many times I got killed because I would go into a room and start getting shot only to find that I couldn't go back out the way I came in because Joe Jackass is crotched down in the doorway trying to shoot. They constantly get in your way and prevent you from moving. And in close quarters intense combat that is not something you want.The lighting in the game seemed a little much. Some slight subtle light rays are good, but Tryarch layed them on thick in this one. It very unnatural looking a lot of the time.The multiplayer is a blast as well. This game is worth picking up!", "\"If you're just getting into the COD series on your PS3, then I recommend you play COD3 BEFORE playing COD4...If you play 4 before 3 like I did, then you'll probably feel some degree of a letdown with COD3...It's just not as good of a game as COD4.With that said, COD3 still has a great deal going for it.  There are a variety of missions & weaponry and you just can't go wrong when you're shooting up Nazis in WWII.  However, if you're a ONE CLEAN HEADSHOT kind of shooter, then you're going to be sorely disappointed with this one!  While there are spots when you put your sniping skills to use, the majority of combat is either in trenches, partially destroyed French homes or across fields when you're storming a German position.  And you can literally shoot 20 shots sometimes before a guy falls, depending on the weapon and firing distance.One thing that really irked me was how you take ferocious blasts from fixed machine gun positions, but then once you take one out and assume control of the gun, THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO SHOOT!!  So you take down an MG42 Gunner and just get to shoot up the French Countryside and maybe a couple of random vehicles before moving on.  While this seems to make sense on the surface (you take the defensive position AFTER you've taken the ground, hence no bad guys left to shoot), wouldn't it be more accurate to think that these positions would have MG42s placed around a perimeter or in more than one side of a house?  After all, the French learned what a tragic mistake a single fortifed line of defense can be with their Maginot Line.Since this game doesn't give you advanced weaponry that obviously didn't exist in 1944, it would've been much sweeter to mow down retreating Nazis with their own MG42s...I can only remember 2 times you get to use one of the fixed MGs and once when you can pick one up and briefly use it.  Just know that when you're using the fixed gun you can and will take heavy fire and frequently have to back off and relinquish the gun unless you want to start the checkpoint over.  Which is another thing...Sometimes the checkpoint saves are quite LONG.  So you can move through a good chunk of territory, make a single mistake and end up going back to the start of that area.  This isn't really unusual in a video game, just somewhat annoying.This game is very unforgiving if you decide to sit back and get into a stationary shootout with your enemies...They will respawn and respawn until you get up and lead your squad forward.  And you DO have to lead them forward most of the time since the AI can be downright stupid, even hilarious.  It's stupid when they block you from getting around in tight quarters or when they jump right in front of your firing weapon...But it's even funny when you're taking a trench and you're behind cover trying to shoot the trench free and your guys just come charging into it right past you and get filled with lead, one by one, a half-dozen by a half-dozen...The bodies literally start piling up right in front of you.There are 2 other \"\"control type\"\" issues I had with this game.  First, you have to ROTATE -- Repeat -- ROTATE the L and R joysticks to direct mortar fire...It's not as simple as just pushing the sticks in the desired direction like in 99.9% of other instances when you use the sticks.  This failure of mine to read ROTATE in the correct way led to a 2 month delay in me completing this game.  I kept getting into the trench where you first use the mortar to CLEAR THE ROAD and I kept shooting rounds into the trees and on the hill wondering WHY it was so hard to direct the fire.  Pretty soon a Nazi would jump into the trench and I'd have to start the level again...And again...And again, until I just quit this one and played through some other games before returning to it.I also had trouble getting the jeep to drive in reverse.  There are a couple of spots where you take over the jeep and have very little room to turn around just driving forward.  Drive it into blockage and you're STUCK!  Oddly enough I changed the view to overhead and was able to back up...But in first person view I just couldn't get it to back up.  It really sucked being stuck up next to a fence or house while trying to turn around...I also MISSED THE FINAL CUT SCENE after fighting through the entire game!  I had no idea I was at the end of the game after blowing up the advancing tanks and was going to pause the game to take a break...I pushed the start button when the scene started playing and BAM!, the credits started rolling.  It would've been nice to see the final scene and maybe I can restart the checkpoint if the game lets me...But if not, I'll get over it.  That's just one more thing that kept adding up to a gaming experience the ended up being inferior to COD4.\"", "If there's one thing Call of Duty 3 deserves tremendous credit for, it's the visuals.  The environment is sharp and realistic, textures are detailed, and there are little extras here that simply weren't available in Call of Duty 2:  things like destructible environments, physics effects, and a focal blur that can sharpen your center of vision when you aim down the sights of your weapon or create disorienting sensations when you're taking damage.  Rain, water effects, and fire all look quite nice too.There are some fun parts here that are specific to the PS3's sixaxis controller, and then some not-so-fun ones.  Sneaking up behind an enemy soldier and shoving the controller at an angle will nicely rifle-butt them and knock them out.  Twisting the controller in the air (like winding a watch) to set the fuse on explosives is a nice touch.  Asking me to hold the controller sideways and move it up and down in a semicircle to simulate paddling a boat is a bit ridiculous and I never seemed to find the right movements.  I was also given the option of using the sixaxis like a steering wheel when driving, but I found it to be too unpredictable: sluggish to start, then overcompensating once the controller reached a certain angle. Thankfully this feature let me use the left stick as an alternative.Unfortunately, the gameplay is dreadful.  It's one thing to have odd button mappings (R1 to accelerate, but Circle to brake; have to pick up a hot grenade with Square, but can't throw it back until you tap R2), but it's quite another to be able to see parts of the game where corners were cut in order to make the thing work.  For example, there's a driving sequence where you have to keep an eye on your compass and hit one marker after another.  During this, you will drive through fences and gates, smashing them with the nose of your Jeep.  Explosions go off when they're scripted to, and trees fall across the road, increasing the suspense.  Except...if the tree hits the road before you pass it, you'd be stuck--so you're allowed to drive right through the tree.  If an explosion goes off and you're way too close to it--you'll survive.  And it's almost funny to see the Germans hole themselves up in buildings full of barrels of gasoline, with more stacked around the outside walls or stacked up right next to machine-gun nests.The biggest problem with Call of Duty 3 though is the AI.  In other titles in the CoD series, I've seen issues like teammates walking in front of your line of fire while you're shooting, or nudging you out from cover to take your spot.  Nothing's perfect and I'm used to this sort of thing.  However, the behaviors in Call of Duty 3 can get downright bizarre.  Enemy soldiers sneaking up on you might continue to tiptoe without firing even when they're only 10 feet away and you're shooting at them.  Your allies occasionally turn around and stare at the ceiling or the sky.  Are they covering your back?  Nope; they just appear to be confused.  The best example of this was in a sequence where we all started moving down a trench.  Everyone is crouched, and German soldiers pop out in front of us and start shouting and raining down heavy fire.  My allies suddenly whirl around and start firing behind them.  Have we been flanked from behind?  I spin around and...the only person behind us is one of our buddies.  Who is standing up.  And my allies shoot him dead before turning around to face the Germans.  We're supposed to set explosives on anti-aircraft installments and then get out of the way.  When I run to cover, I often notice them running towards the explosives, taking cover as close to them as they can (sometimes behind those gasoline barrels).The first-time entry of a series onto new hardware can be daunting.  The programmers at Treyarch deserve a lot of credit for their hard work at the artistry of Call of Duty 3.  While no game is perfect, it is a shame that some of this game went unpolished, even after having this much time to patch things up.  If you want to follow the entire Call of Duty series, then there's something to enjoy for you here; however, you should consider this one of the weakest entries in an otherwise stellar series."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1214136853814125, 0.289238840341568, 0.019686169922351837, 0.17628724873065948, 0.2231297791004181, 0.15417057275772095, 0.01074129343032837, 0.00533236563205719]]}
