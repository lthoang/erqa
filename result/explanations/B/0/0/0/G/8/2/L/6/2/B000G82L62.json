"], "reviews": ["I can only add three things to what others have already said - the aroma of this rice mix will fill your home and you will love it.  Comparied to plain brown rice that I buy at the store (Mahatma) this mix has three times the fiber per serving.  And lastly the cooking directions on my bag differ slightly from the directions here at Amazon - the bag does not say to rinse first (so I don't), and the bag says to cover AFTER you have brought to a boil and reduced the heat.  Other than these comments I can only agree whole-heartedly with the first five reviews, that this totally wholesome food item is scrumpdiddlyumscious.", "I've been into Brown rice for the last few years for the health benefits. I got a little bored and tried this Brown and wild rice blend.It is probable the tastiest rice I've ever had. It has a sort of nutty flavor and aroma that plain rice can't match.Just looking at it on the plate compared to plain rice it looks so much more impressive.I use a rice cooker and when it's cooking it smells so good. In my pressurized cooker it seems to require less water thanI'm used to but with some fine tuning I made it perfectly.I always wash it first to avoid it being sticky.I can't imagine going back to plain rice any time soon. I had company over and couldn't wait to see their reaction to this rice.They loved the smell and the taste. I had to share one of my bags with them. I will definitely reorder before my last bag is done.", "Really excellent rice. I've never had anything like it. Beautiful texture (I used my ancient rice cooker), great aroma and fantastic taste. Looks amazing on the plate. Buy a glass spice jar likeRSVP Square Glass Spice Jarand put the extra rice in it, the uncooked rice is beautiful to look at. Remarkable product, 100% recommended.", "I have been a lifelong lover of white rice and am trying to eat more healthy so I ordered this based on the reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This rice is delicious!  It's nothing like the plain brown rice you get in the store, it's slightly sweeter, more nutty and has a better texture.  It's very easy to cook in a rice cooker (though takes awhile) or baked in the oven.  The aroma is outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about this rice.  It's delicious with grilled veggies, chicken or shrimp for summer.  It's also very filling.  I haven't tried it yet, but I do think it would also make a good porridge or even rice pudding.  I have tried it rinsed or just straight from the package and both ways are great.  The price is also very reasonable.  You get 6 big packages and a little goes a long way with this rice.  I never have to cook more than a cup for dinner for my family.  I have to try the other flavors from Lundberg now!", "this all natural organic blend of wild and brown rice is tasty, with more flavor than store-bought white rice.  Plus, it is more nutritious than white rice.  I was also pleased that the price was reasonable; you get 6 one pound bags in a shipment.", "Delicious and easy to cook. Works wonderfully in the rice maker. Great side dish to any meal. Also cooks well in soups and in the crock pot. Out of the case, two bags had live bugs in them. But I did get a prompt refund. I ordered a second case with no problems. Nutritious and delicious. The kids even love it. Another awesome gluten free food that everyone can agree on.", "I love it! It is very delicious and so different than any rice I have ever eaten before.", "Keeping in mind that rice is one of the least expensive foods on Earth, this rice is very expensive.  This blend is very tasty with nutty and earthy flavors.  White rice (except Basmati) has almost no flavor by comparison.This rice has a long cooking time at about 1 hour or more.  For 2-3 people, I use 6 ounces of rice and 2 cups of chicken broth or filtered water.  This is not the same ratio of rice to water as the cooking instructions on the package.  I cook using a small rice cooker or stovetop at a low simmer.  As with all rice, I add a teaspoon of oil (grapeseed or olive) and a California bay leaf.  I don't think this rice would go well with saffron.Don't stir the rice while cooking except at the very start unless you want the rice to breakdown and get mushy.  Fluff rice with a fork before serving."], "Gamma": [0.10196535289287567, 0.07804375141859055, 0.08721060305833817, 0.0995040237903595, 0.06966608762741089, 0.048368893563747406, 0.06114354357123375, 0.07283411175012589, 0.047154709696769714, 0.08480095863342285, 0.10823527723550797, 0.05198586732149124, 0.054426345974206924, 0.03466051444411278], "Beta": [[0.12514114379882812, 0.12547855079174042, 0.1270981729030609, 0.12891001999378204, 0.13051587343215942, 0.11635369807481766, 0.12439476698637009, 0.12210780382156372], [0.12596449255943298, 0.1269323229789734, 0.12822479009628296, 0.1305890828371048, 0.13343442976474762, 0.11494183540344238, 0.12444118410348892, 0.11547183990478516], [0.125606507062912, 0.1265563666820526, 0.12779086828231812, 0.13001902401447296, 0.13284103572368622, 0.11458836495876312, 0.12436987459659576, 0.11822795867919922], [0.12538865208625793, 0.12520667910575867, 0.12716957926750183, 0.1286896914243698, 0.12947407364845276, 0.11798170208930969, 0.12458792328834534, 0.12150168418884277], [0.12633438408374786, 0.12725159525871277, 0.1287253499031067, 0.1312074363231659, 0.13394905626773834, 0.11536174267530441, 0.12451665103435516, 0.11265382170677185], [0.12767720222473145, 0.1278471052646637, 0.1303313672542572, 0.13255497813224792, 0.13395214080810547, 0.11886437982320786, 0.12517158687114716, 0.10360127687454224], [0.12687206268310547, 0.1269063949584961, 0.1293366402387619, 0.13145585358142853, 0.13256198167800903, 0.11840949207544327, 0.12504133582115173, 0.10941627621650696], [0.1262524276971817, 0.12701059877872467, 0.1284218281507492, 0.13064241409301758, 0.13315242528915405, 0.11616399884223938, 0.12459852546453476, 0.11375778913497925], [0.12761326134204865, 0.1279015690088272, 0.13017448782920837, 0.13307856023311615, 0.13468699157238007, 0.11876094341278076, 0.12481410801410675, 0.10297007113695145], [0.125713050365448, 0.12673452496528625, 0.1278870701789856, 0.12998244166374207, 0.1327861249446869, 0.11501425504684448, 0.1243496835231781, 0.11753281950950623], [0.12492435425519943, 0.12508416175842285, 0.1268790364265442, 0.12861798703670502, 0.129691019654274, 0.11680909246206284, 0.1244053989648819, 0.1235889345407486], [0.12733659148216248, 0.12730912864208221, 0.12983430922031403, 0.13241848349571228, 0.13341020047664642, 0.11941254138946533, 0.12488850206136703, 0.10539025068283081], [0.12742489576339722, 0.1273210644721985, 0.12979477643966675, 0.13185548782348633, 0.1329895406961441, 0.11892734467983246, 0.12515799701213837, 0.10652890056371689], [0.12865544855594635, 0.12884458899497986, 0.1317412108182907, 0.13488367199897766, 0.13652056455612183, 0.1189054474234581, 0.12511606514453888, 0.09533299505710602]]}
