"], "reviews": ["I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.", "\"It doesn't have much flavor, just a hint of coconut.  It has a vaguely gelatinous \"\"mouth-feel\"\" to it.  I can't say it's any worse than fresh coconut water; I've never had that.  But it tastes fresh and was mildly enjoyable when poured over ice.  It's just not my thing at all, and as it's a wee bit expensive, it's unlikely I'll try it again.  But to its credit, I've got more coconut water-enthusiastic friends who swear by this and maintain it tastes just like its real, on-the-beach equivalent.  And it's loaded with potassium goodness.  I cannot fault any aspect of this product - it's just not my thing.\"", "O.N.E. Coconut Water tastes much better, IMO, than sports drinks and electrolyte drinks sold in pharmacies.  I didn't really taste the coconut flavor or Pink Guava for that matter.  It has a light, not to sweet, flavor with electrolytes you need to replace if you've been sick or after exercise. The price is not to expensive and I like the single serve containers as most electrolyte solutions have a short shelf life after opening.  Coconut water is good and good for you.", "If you're expecting something sweet, and almost syrupy like a slightly watered down version of coconut milk -- you're in for a shock.  This has a much lighter taste, just a hint of coconut rather than an overwhelming flavor, but I really enjoyed it.  It's satisfying but not really all that sweet.  It's especially good when it's icy, icy cold -- a real unexpected taste on a summer day.", "Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging.", "This is a very good product and if one likes the flavour. it would do what the sports drinks cLAIM to do!!It would also be excellent for anyone who is ill and needs electrolytes etc.Since the flavour or lack of is my reason for not personally caring for this, I would suggest TRY it to see if it's your 'cup of tea'. IF so, it is a decent healthy drink.", "\"Coconut Water with a splash of PineappleThis is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, \"\"it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"\"  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but \"\"cane juice\"\" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice.\"", "\"I love this.  Not too sugary like so many soft drinks and even fruit juices.  Looks superbly nutritious too.  Note to manufacturer--didn't understand the labeling \"\"Drink After Opening.\"\"  The aroma of this is great, but at $2 average a drink, is there some way of reducing the cost and still preserving the flavor--e.g. smaller containers?  I don't think 11oz is needed to enjoy this.\"", "I've really enjoyed the taste of this Coconut Water and have it on my Subscribe and Save items.  It is a reasonable value, considering the price of various coconut waters, and it tastes really good.  Great potassium and magnesium source which is wonderful for leg cramps.  No fat and no cholesterol.  Love it!", "\"My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year, and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it, you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience, however, it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water, I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.I was wrong.This coconut water might not be fresh and raw, but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8\"\" opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.It is best served cold, so I kept in the refrigerator.The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming, but just right.It has no added flavors or sugars to it, which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.I have compared it to fresh coconut water, and although I do prefer raw fresh water, I am very happy with this as a substitute.I can say this, my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic, trip, or even to work, this is definitely a great item to have handy.You might like it even if you are not into raw foods, but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.\"", "This coconut drink is not bad compared to other drinks. This drink tastes best when really cold. No straw. It is not like juice boxes where you puncture the straw through the foil. Although I would have preferred that it came that way. It would prevent spills for the kids. But then again this is not marketed for kids. It is really easy to open. Pull a foil and you are ready to sip. The mouth is not that big nor to small. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys coconuts.", "Here is a spectacular replacement for those sugar drinks athletes (and unfortunately, kids) are drinking.Natural, pure, HEALTHY.Did you know that a kid drinking 20 oz. of Gatorade a day gains 13 pounds from it in one year?Be smart, be healthy. Try, then switch to coconut water.", "This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.", "So, I kind of grew up on coconuts... having been born on a beach town.  I also grew up Coconut milk, so I was pretty excited about this product.  However, after drinking it... it doesn't meet any of my expectations. It doesn't taste like Coconut  and simply tastes really watered down.  In fact, it tastes like you're just drinking water... very plain.  It wasn't very sweet or flavorful. I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart, but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk, I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up, drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.  Nothing beats that experience... the real deal. Plus, it's better for the environment... no plastic containers or trash to worry about. Plus, it tastes so much better than this product.", "\"I tried O.N.E. Coconut Water, and my opinion is mixed. There's no denying that it's healthy, fat-free, gluten-free and all-natural... but unless you already know you like coconut water/milk, this might not be the thing for you. Having tried coconut milk before, I knew what to expect. It had a slightly foul smell, and the taste is different from anything else. Coconut water is an acquired taste.When my sister tried it, she spit it out in the sink. When my dad tried it, he said, \"\"it's just water.\"\" (It's true--it's very faintly flavored). I didn't think it was the world's greatest drink, but my opinion wasn't quite so negative as that.While not delicious, I will say that the product IS healthy, and its taste is not overbearing. The container was a bit difficult to open as well. All in all, however, it was what I expected. Nothing more, nothing less.\"", "Coconut Water is a fantastic way to replenish your electrolytes and get hydrated. When I toured Thailand and Cambodia I got the water direct from large coconuts sold by the roadside. This is a lot easier to tote around. Coconut water is slightly sweet and lightly astringent, an acquired taste for some. I prefer the Amy and Brian cans better than the water in the O.N.E. (I also like getting little bits of coconut with my coconut water), but O.N.E. compares nicely to Zico or Harvest Bay.Amy and Brian sources their coconut water from Thai coconuts while O.N.E., Zico and Harvest Bay get theirs from South America. There is a real taste difference as the Thai coconuts are sweeter and less astringent.If you're looking for something to throw in you gym bag or backpack when working out this is a nice choice, if you're looking for all around refreshing drink I'd recommend seeking out Amy and Brain brand.", "O.N.E.'s Coconut Water is about straightforward as it gets: 100% coconut water.My first encounter with the green globe and the coconut water inside came after a climb of 1500 steps (and back down again) in ninety-plus degree heat on a dry, dusty winter day in Palitana India.  While I fell far short of the 3500 needed to reach the plateau of temples, I also barely managed to return to the base.Blame it on my Anglo-European genes, sheesh.Back at our vehicle, a vendor hacked off the top of the green globe before offering it too me.  Though the water within was warm, it was more refreshing and cooling than anything else I could have imagined at that moment.The inherent cooling properties of coconut water make it an ideal way to stave off the heat from both the inside out.O.N.E.'s coconut water, though not as 'mentally' satisfying to drink (everyone loves the green globe) certainly is as tasty and refreshing.", "\"This \"\"water\"\" has a very, very light coconut flavor with a hint of sweetness. It is refreshing and doesn't leave an aftertaste like drinks with sugar. I like the fact that it has electrolytes, but they are really unnecessary for most people, in light of the fact that it takes a huge amount of exercise (like running a marathon) before one needs anything other than water to rehydrate. What I don't like is the number of calories, admittedly fewer than, say, an equal amount of soda or juice, but still more than I care to consume in a drink - and the price. I just can't see myself paying two bucks for a 12 oz. container when a glass of water from the tap (or just about any other drink I could choose) is much less. Or free!\"", "\"Not only does this taste fantastic, but look at the product highlights:\"\"High in potassium, fat free, cholesterol free, and low in acidity, no sugar. Contains five essential electrolytes--potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous. It contains similar levels of electrolytes as those found in human blood. Help promote smoother, more hydrated skin. It is an effective oral rehydration medium, and keeps the body cool.\"\"All I know is it taste great, so whenever I want to day dream I am in Oahu on the beach, crack open one of these, shut my office door and have my 5 minute zen.Remember on the movie 'The Collateral' when Jamie Foxx would get his zen by looking at the picture of the island. (This is my zen)\"", "\"...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says \"\"O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"\"  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try.\"", "I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.", "I had my doubts after reading all of the reviews. I had never tasted this brand coconut water before, only Vita Coco brand. There is a difference. I prefer Vita Coco over One brand by far. In general, coconut water is very light, crispy, and refreshing. It has a very mild taste that is good alone or could easily be mixed into a smoothie or with alcohol (rum, vodka, etc). It hydrates the body better than water or sports drinks. I used it when I was sick. It helped me feel better a lot faster. The buy one case, get one case of cashew juice deal free is a great bargain. The cashew juice was so good, I bought another case of One brand coconut water just for that reason. Pretty good for the lower price.", "I have tasted coconut water and this is coconut water in a drink box.  It needs to be served cold.It is a mostly clear, tinged white drink.  100% coconut water from the fruit. The aseptic pack is convenient and gives no off taste.I like the health benefits that the water brings.Price is right here, as they cost about $2 each in the local market.", "Received this yesterday, and today, everyone in my family tried it.  It tasted REALLY awful.  I would never, ever buy this product again.  I'm honestly shocked it has so many good reviews.  I don't know if we got a bad batch or what, but it was downright disgusting.  I couldn't even drink half of it before dumping it out.", "O.N.E. Coconut Water is a refreshing alternative to soft drinks. A splash of pink guava gives this drink the sweetness and flavor you want without resorting to anything artificial. The 8.5 ounce serving is about right because this is a drink you want to savor with or without a meal, but definitely not guzzle. Highly recommended!", "I love coconut water and have had to take a machete to lop off the top to get to it. This is great! It is almost as good as out of a coconut, but what makes it nice is you do not have to get the coconut or open it. Just pull the top and drink it. It has a very natural taste as if it has never been in a container. Read the product features above and you can see not only is this product all natural, but good for you. It will quench your thirst, hydrate you and help promote smoother, more hydrated skin. Definitely worth drinking!", "The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills.", "\"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the \"\"Splash of Pineapple\"\", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any \"\"Natural Fruit flavor\"\".To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how \"\"healthy\"\" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.And as a \"\"thirst quencher\"\", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst.\"", "\"This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a \"\"health drink\"\"? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good.\"", "\"Just to give this drink a good chance, I stuck it in the fridge for a couple of days, shook it really well, and tried it straight, without ice.  The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a \"\"Coconut Water\"\".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.Overall, Not crazy about it.Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.  But at least the container's mostly paper and potentially better for the environment?\"", "I'd recommend this product for someone who needs potassium but can't or won't eat bananas. Potassium is important for your heart and if you are nauseous. It would be very effective for athletes or people in danger of dehydration. It's a natural, raw food containing 5 electrolyes, which are important for your heart to function properly. Your electrolyte balance can be upset by dehydration, over-exertion or illness, and any athlete can tell you that that's dangerous. This would be a great drink to have on hand if you could only have fluids or couldn't keep solid food down. I think of it more as a supplement than a beverage because there isn't much taste to it, but it would be handy to keep in your locker at the gym or in your bag. It's much healthier than a sport drink containing artificial colors and flavors.You'd expect it to taste like coconuts, but it really doesn't. There might be a faint suggestion of coconut flavor, but I'm not sure you'd notice it if you didn't know what you were drinking. Otherwise, it's like drinking water. Not bad, not really good, just there. I can see myself picking up one of these to eat with a meal just for the potassium boost, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I had the flu, was playing sports, working out or was working hard - like mowing lawns, gardening, doing construction - in hot weather . Then I'd want to have these in the fridge (they taste best ice cold,) because they would definitely be better than just drinking water.  I'd use it as a sort of adult Pedialyte or a natural Gatorade. I'll probably keep some around this summer for that very reason.", "I love this flavor but wish it were 11.2 ounces like most coconut waters out there, I wouldn't feel it was so spendy if it were larger.  If you don't care about size you will be delighted by the fresh fruit flavor!  I drank these through morning sickness and they helped me so much when i couldn't keep plain water down.
