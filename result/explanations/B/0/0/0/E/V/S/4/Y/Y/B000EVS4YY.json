The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose. This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work, and I need to shake the camera, or remove the battery and insert it  back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive. Made in China. Does not work. Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery?", "I bought this NB-5L as a secondary battery for a Canon PowerShot SX210IS three years ago and it's still charges fast and holds the charge as well as it did when new.  I highly reccomend this battery and you will want to have a spare fully charged battery if you're going to be shooting a lot of video.", "I bought this battery in March 2014 because the NB-5Ls that I have were purchased in 2010 and 2012 and were not holding a charge well. I didn't use the battery until May 2014 and in three tries found that it is WORSE than my two and four year old batteries. I had hoped to exchange this with Amazon but all I get is an automated notice online that the the return period was onl 1 month long -- so presto, out of luck. In this case, shame on Amazon.", "Good price for a very reliable battery. I use two of them almost daily and have been extremely pleased with their performance.", "Not much one can say about this other than it's original factory Canon and works as advertised.It fit our camera perfectly.", "If you are planing on taking that camera on vacation you need another battery and this thing is cheap enough to make the decision a no brainer!You know it is true! You will get to having SO MUCH FUN and forget that your camera has been working from sun up to sun down and now you have no photos of you and that special someone dancing at the cantina! You have no pictures of the lightshow, fireworks or anything else that happened after 9:34pm. The moment that your camera died!Charge both batteries, keep one in the case and one in the camera. Problem solved!", "I have bought generic batteries for my Canon cameras previously, and I've bought Canon brand batteries before.I've had mixed experiences with generic, some matching Canon, others falling well short. But I've never had a bad experience with the Canon battery, and that is true of this battery as well.I know it's more expensive, but I like to have a second (or third) battery that I can rely on while travelling abroad. This battery definitely meets that standard. I can definitely understand wanting to save some money (often quite a bit) but when it comes down to it for me, I like to know my equipment will perform as intended. This battery does just that.", "As stated in the product description. The battery came in a retail package and was a Canon NB-5L battery. I have cycled this battery and it works like the ones I had bough directly from Canon.", "I originally bought this from iOttie, and the battery they originally sent was somewhat fatter in the center.  The battery worked, but when trying to remove it, it wouldn't have to come out and I had to get a pair of tweezers to get it out.I communicated with the seller and they sent me another and that one worked fine.I have two original Canon batteries, and now a working non-Canon from iOttie, and I cannot tell the difference in terms of quality.Definitely a good purchase.", "It is always nice to have a back - up battery when traveling.
