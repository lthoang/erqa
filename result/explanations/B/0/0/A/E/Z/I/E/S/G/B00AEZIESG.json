Some weren't convinced until they could touch it and place it against their ear.____________________________________________________________I am not keen to review little mono Bluetooth speakers because most of them turn out to be worth little. Or, given the increasingly high quality of tablets and even phones little speakers, not worth the trouble of operating them as their use often replaces a tablet's superior stereo sound with lower quality mono. There are, of course exceptions and, as expected, they tend to be at the high-end... end of the price scale.With the above in mind, Tonez' CAN speaker is one of the few that, in my view, is actually worth getting. It delivers extraordinarily crisp sound coupled with a surprisingly powerful bass. Yes, it's not true stereo but it's easy to overlook that once it starts playing. And it can play very, very loud for a contraption this small. No, it does not 'fill the room' but it comes close and the bass is almost booming in a most impressive way.Now, for the 'not so good' observations:- The MicroSD playback capability is a little bit of an overkill because all you can do is to sequentially skip from one song to the next and if you have more than a dozen songs on your card it's not that practical.- The claim that it can operate from 'up to 50 ft' from its host may be slightly exaggerated. Sound started to break once I moved 12-15 ft away while testing it in a largely empty basement. I suspect that a 50 ft range could be achieved under some very ideal conditions.- Due to the lack of a visual display other than the little blinking LED, controls are sometimes touch and go but that it's no big deal if all you do is 'Bluetooth'.- Controlling playback (stop/pause/resume) on the host is not always possible. It didn't work for me while testing with Pandora on an Android PC.With these in mind, the CAN still gets 4 stars because I like it to the point of almost loving it. It's a great output device for as long as you ignore the unnecessary features that are either not needed (radio, MicroSD support) or way too much trouble to implement when considering the rewards (chaining of several CANs together, using it as a MicroSD card reader, controlling it from 2 different devices, the radio feature). Consolidating the positive impression is the included and very nice carrying bag, the charger and charging cable, the clearly high-end design and build.If you feel like Bluetooth pairing your phone or tablet with a very small speaker that can be very loud and outputs brilliant, loud sound with great bass and it's not going to break your budget then go for it. All the other features... not so impressive so look elsewhere if you really want a little speaker that can be used as a MicroSD card reader (really?) or plays over the air radio or allows you to chain several of them (why?).Oh... specs:- Speaker: 40mm, 2.6&#937;, 3W- Frequency response: 60Hz-18kHz (sounds better then the specs)- Lithium battery capacity: 430 mAh- THD: &#8804; 0.5%- SNR: &#8805; 95dB- Size: 60mm x 54mm- Bluetooth: 3.0", "This is the one! It's not crazy expensive. It is about as small as one of those cow noise makers you had as a kid. When I ordered this I expected it would be the size of a coffee can. Boy was I wrong. It's slightly bigger than a golf ball. It's very well made and is heavy, likely from the battery. Hooking up bluetooth took some fiddling but once it was up and running the small unit exploded with sound. I can not believe this tiny thing is doing what it does. This is the one you want. Get more than one to link them for even better sound. This comes with lots of connectors for car, home, computer, MP3, etc. It also has a micro SD card slot so you can play sounds with nothing else but this unit. For the car, camping, beach, anywhere, this is the portable bluetooth speaker you have been wanting. There is even an antenna for FM radio! And a mic so you can answer cell phone calls!", "This tiny speaker puts out an amazingly good sound! It has better bass response than speakers that are 4 times as large, but also maintains clear, crisp upper and mid ranges. The sound just floored me &#8211; one of the best sounding speakers in its size and price range that I&#8217;ve ever used.The build quality is also top-notch. It has a lot of heft to it, and feels really solidly-made. Although it is less than 2.5 inches in diameter it weighs 9.1 ounces. I&#8217;m especially fond of the non-skid base which is not only non-skid but very grippy. It also comes nicely packaged with an attractive carry pouch.The volume is loud. And I mean LOUD! One of the complaints I&#8217;ve had with small speakers is that the volume range is so limited. Not with this &#8211; you can blast it so that it can be heard throughout the house. While the sound gets harsh at the upper limit, the sound quality is maintained well throughout volume settings that I would consider very loud.It has a novel feature in that it includes an FM tuner, a feature I&#8217;ve not encountered before in a compact speaker. It comes with an antenna with a micro USB connector. That didn&#8217;t pull in any stations at all indoors, and only a couple outdoors. I had slightly better reception using the flexible USB cord and extending it out fully. But even if the reception was better, the FM radio option seems to be an odd inclusion &#8211; there&#8217;s no station frequency readout, so it&#8217;s a pain to tune in and set the station you want. Plus, with Internet radio so readily available, I have to wonder about the usefulness of an over-the-air tuner in this particular device.The Bluetooth range is decent. I could comfortably use it at 20 to 25 feet. Past 25 feet, however, and there were connection problems. The stated range of 50 feet is way too optimistic. It can also be used as a direct connect via a 3.5mm jack.Where is falls really short is the user interface. The buttons for volume, mode switching and track skipping are small, hard to find, and have black on black lettering which makes them indistinguishable from one another in anything but the brightest light. There is no clear feedback as to which mode you&#8217;re in (bluetooth, FM, SD card, etc.) since the only indicator light is a tiny LED. The on/off switch is also tiny and hard to see.These user interface issues should not occur at this price point. Additionally, the FM radio is basically useless, and the bluetooth range is overstated. But the sound &#8211; it does sound good! That makes up for a lot of the faults. I'm torn between 3 stars and 4, but given the price, I'm going with 3 stars since I expect a better design at this price point.", "\"The diameter of this speaker is a bit less than the typical soft drink can and thus makes it well-suited to sitting in a drink holder in a vehicle. Similarly for having sound come out the top. However, all the controls are around the base of the device, forcing you to pick it up to make any adjustments. One-handed operation was possible for me (5'10\"\" male) but might be difficult for smaller people. The controls have very low visual contrast with the body -- a passenger had difficulty operating it at night (until she had it illuminated by the car behind us).I cannot see myself ever using this as a speakerphone while being a driver -- it is too awkward and requires too much attention. Nor would I bother to have it used by most of the people who are passengers with me: They tend to reject my directions of how such a device works in favor of their own intuitions of how it *should* work. And even for such simple functionality, I found myself repeatedly \"\"experimenting\"\" to get it to do what I wanted.However, as a portable speaker for around the office, house or yard, it did quite well. It has a good texture that makes it easy to carry. The weight and slip-resistant bottom kept it in place.I have given it a mediocre rating because of what I view as poor design of the controls and because the design of the connectors sacrifice what I regard as the more common and important functions in favor of functions I see no value for (chaining together multiple speakers).----Sound: The sound produced was surprisingly good, significantly better than other BT speakers of similar size that I have encountered (although most of those have somewhat lower prices). The produces a good range of frequencies and in balance (no need to adjust the player). I used it with various types of music and didn't encounter anything that was displeasing (in contrast to some others which are irritating to me on Rock and similar because they have far too little base and have too much treble).----Bluetooth: The range for this device is very similar to my other Bluetooth devices.Realize that this is BT v3.0 which doesn't include low-power capabilities in BT v4.0. My understanding is that the primary advantage of BT 4.0 for a speaker occurs when it is often in \"\"standby mode\"\" (connected, but no audio being sent to it).----Recharging: By a provided micro-USB cable. This is a standard cable, despite the connector on the speaker being non-standard (below), thereby making replacement trivial if it is lost, misplaced, or forgotten. The package also includes USB power adapters for both auto and wall-plug (much appreciated).I tended to use this speaker in shorter session, and thus would loose track of how much charge was likely left on the battery. It would have been very nice to have an indicator, but most of the competing products don't seem to have one either.----Connections explained -- as best I can infer:The physical USB connector is not wired as such. A conventional USB cable (provided) is used only to recharge the battery -- it does *not* provide a hardwired connection between a computer and the speaker. The data pins on the USB connector are instead used to provide an analog Aux-In stereo connector.Included in this product is a cable with a 3.5mm stereo connector and a micro-USB connector. The manual shows this as intended for chaining multiple CAN speakers together. However, it can also be used to connect the Line-Out of a laptop or similar device to the speaker (the manual makes a vague mention of this). However, with my computer, setting the volumes to max on both the computer and the speaker produces only medium volume (far less than when connected by Bluetooth).DISADVANTAGE: This arrangement means that if you are using a hardwired connection for the audio -- for example where there are competing Bluetooth devices -- you have to run the speaker on battery power (the connector is not available for the recharging cable).NOTE: The 3.5mm connector on the speaker is Aux-Out (vs Aux-In on many similar products).----FM Radio: The instructions are grossly inadequate for the radio. My first attempts to use it failed miserably. As I stepped through the stations, all I heard was loud static where the stations were, which I mistook for reception problems. When I turned down the volume way down, I could hear the stations. Because the speaker has no similar problem producing good output from a BT connection, this suggests to me that this is not a problem with the speaker portion, but noise being introduced within the electronics, for example, the speaker coil broadcasting to the antenna (feedback). On most stations, I found that I had to substantially turn down the volume to get rid of the noise/static, leaving a fairly narrow range where it was loud enough to hear without that static.The radio is of limited usefulness because you have to step through stations without any indication of where you are \"\"on the dial\"\", making it hard to get back to a desired frequency/station. The instructions mention \"\"pre-set\"\" stations without explanation of setting or accessing (and experimentation failed).When automatically scanning through stations, it pauses for 2-3 seconds before stepping to the next one. For me, this was a bit too short to recognize and respond. Although I could use auto-scan and then manually back-up, I found it more convenient to simply manually step through stations.My product came with a telescoping antenna for the radio, but the manual described the antenna as a wire that is combined with one of the provided cables. I don't know if mine is the new version, or if it is an old version being phased out.----MicroSD card slot: I didn't use this.----Douglas B. Moran\"", "Small enough and light enough to fit  even the tightest of space/weight restrictions, theTonez Audio Corp. CAN Portable Bluetooth Speaker/Speakerphone (Stealth/Black)is a great Bluetooth speaker that also allows you to receive phone calls. A micro-SD slot means that you can bring along a large library of music without using valuable bandwidth to play music from your Cloud. Bright colors, good sound and a decent range make this a fun gadget.Recommended", "This is a neat little bluetooth speaker. I was very surprised at how small and heavy it was but also how powerful it was for its size.Pros:- Solid construction and small size. Stainless steel housing. Diameter of speaker is about 6cm, 2.5inches.- Very loud for its size. I have other small speakers and none are as powerful as it. You get what you pay for and you're paying for more powerful magnets and solid construction.- Functionality: FM radio, micro SD card, 3.5mm audio line-in, bluetooth, speakerphone.- Includes wall charger, car charger, charge cord, daisy chain cable, carrying pouch.- Can daisy chain to add more speakers.Cons:- Only 4 buttons and 2 LED lights control all the functions, You'll need to learn how to operate all 4 modes (radio, aux, bluetooth, micro SD) from the manual. That means if you bring this to a party, no one else will be able to operate it except for you.Comments: For me, speakers always come down to sound quality because if the sound isn't good, all the extras don't matter. In this case, the tiny speaker does a very good job of providing decent sound. I never like the minimalist approach of providing minimal control buttons for a number of functions, but that's just me and no doubt other people will not have a problem with that. So overall, a very decent speaker for that tiny size.", "The Tonez CAN Portable Bluetooth Speaker gives a big sound in a small package.The first thing you realize when you pick up this speaker is that for a cylindrical item that is only about 2 1/8 inches high and 2 5/16 in diameter, this thing is dense--it weighs in around 9 ounces. It feels solid and heavy in your hand.The CAN connects easily via Bluetooth (or via the included 3.5 mm audio cord) and the sound is strikingly rich and big, especially for a monaural speaker.  Of course, you are not going to get the same kind of bass with such a small speaker that you will with a mega subwoofer, but the bass was far more booming than I expected in something this size.  As with most of these speakers, there is no built in equalizer, but this company shows major chutzpah in that they have clearly--and effectively--emphasized the bass with this speaker. This makes the speaker more geared towards pop, but it still functioned well with classical music and jazz. In fact, the sound quality throughout the spectrum was clear and there was almost now fraying even at higher volume.In terms of connectivity, the speaker has a USB port and 3.5 in jack.  It also has a slot for a mini-SD card, so that you can play tunes directly from the card without any other device--although I did not trial this.  According to literature it can also be daisy chained with other CAN speakers via the 3.5 mm connector, although connecting two or more devices will not result in stereo reproduction of sound.  I was able to answer telephone calls using the device easily.  You can also use the device to listen to FM radio.  This is a nice feature, I suppose, but relatively useless in a device such as this which is really meant to serve as a speaker.Overall, the fit and finish of the device shows high production values. It comes in a number of different finishes, my device was finished in a dull black, with a rubberized coating although there appear to be a number of colors for the taking.  The buttons on the bottom of the device and the on-off switch function perfectly, but are also the only things that have an inexpensive, plasticky feel about them.  After paying such close attention to the fit and finish of the rest of the speaker, it's not clear why they cheaped out on the buttons.On the whole, this is a worthy Bluetooth speaker.  It has all the requisite bells and a sound that is unrivaled in a device of this size.", "I've tried a lot of bluetooth/mini speakers. Some cut it and some don't. Usually the price is indicative of the quality but not always. So even thought his little speaker carries a higher price tag than many, it comes with a sound quality that makes it all worth it.It is heavy, much heavier than other speakers this size. I'm not sure why but that makes me think it is made of something better and higher quality. It pairs easily and plays beautifully. It doesn't vibrate on a counter and can handle a high volume without distorting. Rock, classical, acoustic, and spoken word, all sound great.It has a good range away from your bluetooth device (I had at least 50 feet but didn't go any further) but also comes with an audio cable for use with a non-bluetooth device. It has the option of playing music from a micro memory card although I haven't tried that yet. It can also act as a phone receiver for answering calls.Overall, this is a great speaker, probably the best I've heard so far (although I haven't used any much higher priced than this) and the quality construction and portability makes it perfect for many uses.", "\"The Tonez CAN Bluetooth speaker has all sorts of puzzling extra bells and whistles, but in the end the sound of this speaker is delightfully clear and loud. This is MUCH smaller than a can, and is more the size of a smaller SLR lens (and about the same weight). Bluetooth connectivity is lightening fast. I connected via my laptop and in less than 10 seconds was blasting \"\"Cows with Guns\"\" via YouTube. I find I just whip this out, slap it on the kitchen counter, and start blasting away.This is NOT stereo, and I don't think I'm missing anything. This is a very cute/cool boutique kind of speaker, and you can pretty much ignore the extras.This is advertised as a modern boom box, and it is, even in a retro kind of way. For example, the ability to play music stored on a micro-SD chip reminds me of a cassette recorder because you can only move sequentially backwards and forwards, just like a tape. Since it also has an FM stereo receiver, you literally have an old school low-end boom box the size of a camera lens. My version came with an extendable antenna and I was easily able to pull up local radios. You could actually carry this thing around all by itself and listen to the radio and otherwise annoy passerbys with your music taste by playing the \"\"cassette\"\" (Micro-SD chip).You get all the cables and stuff you need, and a quite nice pouch to carry the CAN around. Did I mention the sound? Not audiophile quality, and not MEANT to be so, but it's surprisingly loud and has excellent clarity and fidelity. I give it 5 stars for the quality of the sound alone.This is a fun, and funny, device.\"", "The technological advances that have happened in recent years with companion Bluetooth products for smart devices has been stunning. When it comes to speakers, bigger is no longer better. And this Tonez speaker proves that is true. The first time I ever connected it to the Bluetooth on my iPad (super easy to do!) and played some Maroon 5, I was blown away by the robust sound that came out of this thing. I now use it to listen to online radio in my house and it's crystal clear audio with a nice bass. Don't think about getting this--GET IT! It's a big mighty sound in an itty bitty speaker.", "\"The Tonez Audio CAN packs a lot into a little speaker that is about 2 1/8 in. tall and 2 3/8 in. wide, and it's quite dense, weighing over 8 oz.  It is designed for portable, personal use, and has a grippy surface underneath, like that on smartphone cradles, for use in vehicles.It comes with a lot of accessories, including a car charger, a wall charger, an FM antenna, and a storage pouch, as well as the usual USB-to-micro charging cable and an audio line, in this case micro-USB to 3.5 mm jack.The 430 mAh lithium ion battery charges up overnight and will provide power enough to play at moderate volume for at least six hours.  The Bluetooth pairs easily as \"\"Tonez Audio CAN\"\", although the range seems to be somewhat limited to about 25 to 30 feet.  The 3 W driver puts out a surprising amount of sound with little distortion, and is definitely weighted to bass.  The quality is quite satisfactory for a personal speaker of this size, considering that it is mono rather than stereo.The telephone functions quite well, better than on most devices, but the radio doesn't do a good job of bringing in stations even with the antenna.  I tried attaching another FM antenna to the one included, but that didn't help.  I didn't test it with an SD card.The warranty service requires a $30 fee with a receipt of purchase or a $75 fee without a receipt;  Tonez Audio Corp. recommends returning it to the seller before requesting warranty service.The black model has a soft-touch surface; many colors are available.\"", "\"There is a run on competition with portable Bluetooth speakers.  Some are a rip-off and some really shine.  The \"\"CAN\"\" shines above the rest, but there are a lot of good reasons why.  First, it comes with an \"\"easy to read\"\" manual, a micro USB cable (for charging through your PC or the enclosed Apple USB wall socket attachment), a 3.5mm Stereo Cable (for adding another \"\"CAN\"\"), a nice automobile USB adapter and a felt drawstring bag to carry it all in.It pairs immediately - faster than any other Bluetooth I have used.  Why does it sound so good?  First, the highs are perfect, the mid-range very good and the bass is very good.  I love good bass and although this is not a `thundering' bass, it's as good as or better than most.  You have to remember that this is a mono speaker fit in an approximately 2\"\" X 2\"\" metal CAN.  Basically the sound is impeccable and can fill a small room.  Outside it sounds just as good with that `open' sound.  It also acts as a speaker for in and out phone calls and the sound is just as good as your phone device (there is a tiny microphone).  The sound secret is the 1 pound of weight, 3.7 volts and 3 watts of power (most are 2 watts).The kit contains a Micro USB cord for USB charging.  Out of the box, it took about one (1) hour to fully charge, but the sound (I'll update to see) supposedly lasts eight (8) hours.  Most do.  The is a 3.5mm/Micro USB AUX in cord so that you can group two or more \"\"CAN\"\"s to make more sound.  I found this to be nice but excessive.  You really don't need that much sound, it's that good.The Bluetooth speaker states a distance of fifty (50) feet, but I found it was `steady' at thirty (30) feet and this was through one wall.  Perhaps outside without an interruption, the fifty-feet would work.  One nice feature is that when you turn the power off and then on again, the Bluetooth pairs again within a few seconds.There is a Micro SD card reader that stores as many songs as you can fit (depending on the GB on the card).  It also inserts and stays flush, unlike the photo on the web page.  It's an easy spring action loader.The indicator lights are a bit small.  You really have to be conscious about what you are doing.  It will be RED when charging and alternate with BLUE and GREEN depending on what usage you are using.  Next to these two lights are the buttons for MODE, Fast Forward/Pause, Decrease Volume and Increase Volume.  The PLAY/PAUSE button is also used for advancing through FM radio stations.FM radio.  I had some trouble getting a good solid sound, even though the kit comes with a 12-inch extendable antenna.  I think this is simply a circumstance of where you are at the moment.The extra features are very nice, but my smartphone can store all my songs, so the Micro SD card was just a fun feature.  The idea of adding extra CAN's is nice, but I wonder how many people would go this route.  The FM transmitter is a great idea and I cannot wait to try it in a good receptive area.  The wall adapter and automobile adapters are something that you don't usually get in a kit and these are nice to have.The bottom line is the sound.  It's very good as stated above.  I pause slightly at the price, which I think is high, even though the kit is one of the best I have seen or heard.  But for the person who really wants everything in one portable speaker, the \"\"CAN\"\" really is the best thing out there.\"", "The first thing you notice when you take these out of the box is that they are hefty. They're small -- about the size of the bottom third of a Coke can -- but they are solidly built.You can charge them up via USB plug, that comes with it, which you can plug either into a computer or into the provided wall and car sockets for ultimate portability. It's a cinch to connect to a Bluetooth device. I've connected it both with a laptop and an iPhone, and it has a good range and delivers great sound.The bass is strong, and the speaker is clear, and gets loud. You can adjust its maximum volume on the speaker itself, and then lower it from there using the volume controls on your device.It's obviously great for outdoors, but would also be an ideal way to share music or other recorded sounds in a classroom or a meeting. It's so much more convenient to carry this along with your phone into the classroom than a larger sound setup.Well-built, sounds great, easy-to-use, and portable. This is a nice device.", "It's true, this tiny speck of a speaker can blast high quality sound better than most speakers 5x its size. The bass is distinct and crisp, without distortion, and high frequencies are also tight and fluid. I tried a wide variety of music, from classical to techno, and all sounded great. The volume can get REALLY loud, so there's no problem with it being too quiet. I would never put it on full blast because that would be way too loud for me, but I did once to test and the audio still sounded great and distortion-free.The Bluetooth was a breeze to setup - all you do is turn the switch to 'on' and locate the signal from your Bluetooth device. I have been streaming audiobooks from my Kindle Fire to the Can and absolutely love it. The voices are so distinct and clear, it's like the reader is in the room with me.Overall, I'm very happy. My only concern is the longevity of the product which I cannot fully comment on, since I've only been using it a few weeks. I've had similar tiny Bluetooth speakers before that stopped working after a few days or refused to change. In the instruction booklet, there are a LOT of warnings, like - &#34;DO NOT CHARGE FOR LESS THAN TWO HOURS!&#34; and &#34;MAKE SURE SPEAKER IS ON A COMPLETELY FLAT SURFACE&#34; that made me a little nervous, but maybe those are just typical of all electronics. The CAN does come with a &#34;limited 1 year warranty&#34; so that relieves my worries a little bit. Anyway, rest assured that I will be updating this review right away if any abnormal problems start showing up. Right now, I think it's a fabulous product!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0013015272561460733, 0.3312879800796509, 0.00012555017019622028, 0.002182501833885908, 0.22891904413700104, 0.003410217585042119, 0.0010813670232892036, 0.0036452070344239473, 0.10102373361587524, 0.016234342008829117, 0.0018522351747378707, 0.004381902050226927, 0.30291125178337097, 0.0016430955147370696]]}
