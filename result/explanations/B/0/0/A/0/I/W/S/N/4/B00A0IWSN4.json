I am also extremely pleased with the price.  Very reasonable in my opinion.  This is a recommend to buy.", "I hadn't jumped on the Argan Oil bandwagon till I used this conditioner but now I want the shampoo, too. After using it just once, I have no flyaways and my hair color even looks brighter! If I have one quibble, it's that the cap is tough to open. It should snap right up but a steamy shower creates suction and I had to wrestle it open. But the product does wonders for dry hair!", "I must rate this five stars due to the brilliant shine my hair has after I used this. I've never used anything, besides the original Morroccan Oil, that imparts such great shine on my frizzy hair.I have slightly oily hair, and this does have some almond and coconut oil in it, so I have to wash it the next day after I use this, but that's not a big deal. I am impressed with all the Suave Professionals Morroccan Oil products, and this one in particular. It soaks into my hair and softens it like nothing else I have tried.I have been searching for a mask type product to moisturize my hair, since I swim in a chlorinated pool almost every single day. My hair takes a beating. I usually don't use any type of products that contain oil, but this one is the exception to that rule. This gives incredible smoothness and shine, and my hair doesn't have any frizz, which is unusual.I have found also that after I use this and rinse it out, if I do a very light shampoo afterwards, I can usually have the benefits of the product without the slight oiliness afterwards.", "\"This is another new Suave product that I am pleased with. The Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask had good slip and moisturizing qualities. I did not see the \"\"shine\"\" in my hair that it claims to have, but I was still very pleased with the moisture it gave to my hair. My hair also felt stronger and healthier after using this product.\"", "You cannot beat the price on this, even if it means an extra step.  You wash with the Moroccan shampoo, then use this for several minutes (no middle step of add'l conditioner like Tresemme does).  Rinse it and then you can use the Moroccan oil shine for a finish.The price for all three was under $10, which is less than I used to pay for Redken or Biosilk.  The products smell great and don't feel oily like some oil additive shampoos.I can't praise this enough. I've sampled several this few months and this is what I buy now.", "A hair mask is really just a more concentrated conditioner.  Designed to keep frizz and damage at bay, it is used once a week or less frequently for an infusion of moisture.  Containing argan oil, this one promises to improve hair texture and impart noticeable shine.The product is liberally applied to wet hair and left on for three to five minutes.  I found it rinses easily. The scent is a lush floral with vanilla and coconut undertones. It is not overwhelming. My hair was silky smooth.  It felt soft but not overly so.  However, I did not enjoy any great increase in shine. My hair had a nice sheen but was not especially shiny.This product was easy to use. It requried no heat or caps, just a few minutes once or twice a week. I did notice an improvement in texture but did not experience the amazing argan oil shine I have been hearing about. Could I get similar results just leaving my regular conditioner on for a longer time? Probably.This product provides a conditioning boost. My hair felt very smooth and soft without being greasy or flat. The price is competitive.  Your invesment in time and money is small and the results are impressive.", "I have shorter hair, and it is slowly but surely turning grey. I don't color it, since to me that is a losing battle. But that does mean that the grey is more dry, dull and difficult to work with. So I was curious about using this, as I've heard good things about the argan oil. The instructions say to use a couple of times a week in place of your regular conditioner, but since I only need to wash my hair that much anyway, I just stopped using my other conditioner and put this in its place.I really like it. There is a noticeable difference in my hair. It is much softer and easier to manage - even the grey hair. There is a bit more shine, but I'm not sure how obvious it really is. No one has mentioned anything about it yet ;) But even without any extra shine, it just feels better. I will continue using this and am planning on looking into the shampoo as well!", "The softening effect was obvious really quickly, and I'm very happy with it. I also really like the smell. It's pleasant without being excessively floral like a lot of products tend to be.How well it soaks up probably depends a little on the texture of your hair, but mine hasn't been processed much so it tends to soak products up pretty well. I'm quite happy with results vs pleasantness to use vs retail price so far.", "\"Suave has always been an afforable and reliable hair product. I was really excited when they came out with this \"\"high end\"\" product at an affordable price. Who wants those high prices int he salons for \"\"product\"\" when one can buy the same quality in their supermarket or drugstore for tless?I have use this as both a was hout an dleave in conditionaer and it works well both ways. I am 58 and my hair has changed in texture from \"\"silky\"\" to \"\"wirey: . Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Depp Conditioning Shine Mask puts youth back in my hair without leaving it greasy.I HIGHLY reccomend this product!\"", "This stuff is amazing. Suave's Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Mask gave me incredible shine and softness. I alternate withSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 ozand my color lasted about 2 weeks longer than usual. I live in South Florida so fading is a huge problem that Suave seems to have fixed. It does not weigh my hair down and the shine lasts until the next shampoo. Suave is known for affordable, quality hair care and this is a salon quality product at a fraction of the cost. Treat yourself!", "My hair feels really soft after using this, however, the thin part of my layers are still dry.  Perhaps after a few more uses, it won't be.  If I use coconut oil, orOrganix Hydrating Macadamia Oil Conditioner -- 13 fl oz, my hair isn't frizzy anywhere, however, they do tend to weigh it down more then I like.  I have very fine hair, so I have to be cautious about using too much oil in it.  This conditioner washes nicely out of my hair, and it feels so soft in the shower when it's wet.  I was able to pick through my hair more easily then when I use a different conditioner.The smell is atrocious.  I seriously can't stand it.  I can't put my finger on exactly what the scent is, but it's gross.  It smells kind of like a masculine, medicine scent.  It's really displeasing to my nose.  The smell does go away once it's washed out, so that's good, however, I can't get past it.  I have a really strong sense of smell, so certain odors bother me, and this is one of them.The smell and the fact that part of my hair is still dry and frizzy, is why I won't be purchasing this in the future.Edited 3/6/13My hair was a mess the day after using this.  It was fly-away and frizzy.  This did nothing for my hair.  I am changing my rating to a 1.", "I like this conditioner. It contains Dimethicone (a silicone) as one of its main ingredients. That's probably why my hair felt so soft after using it. This conditioner is nice and thick. The fragrance is pleasant and subtle. Overall, it's a good conditioner at a good price.", "I am not a huge fan of Suave shampoos and conditioners, but this product works very well. It is a thick, nice smelling deep conditioner that left my hair shiny and soft. I have very thick hair that can be difficult to comb through. My hair is also a little on the dry side and this helped to moisturize it pretty well. I use it every other day, alternating it with my regular conditioner. Though the product boasts argan oil, the ingredient is pretty low on the list. This product contains a fair amount of petrolatum and mineral oil, which may weigh thinner hair types down.", "I also reviewed the conditioner of this same line within Suave. This is a DEEP conditioner for when your hair is REALLY feeling dry and difficult. With where I live we get a lot of wind and I like to have something I can put on my hair while showering and be able to wash it out at the end of the shower.I have only used this once but liked it. One thing I liked about about both this and the regular conditioner is the scent..it has Moroccan Argan oil in it and I am not sure if the Argan is part of the scent or not, but whatever, it's a very pleasant yet unusual spicy scent.  I've never owned products that smelled like this before. I think it's a good once or twice a week conditioner, any more than that might be overkill...its not greasy after you have rinsed it out, that was nice, as other brands of these deep conditioners can leave a lot of residue on your hair.", "Pleasantly surprised by the moisturizing  effect of this shampoo. I didn't expect it to be so effective given the price. The smell is slightly oily but not overwhelming. My hair was recently dryer than usual from a perm treatment and this shampoo brought back the spring and shininess in my hair. Would definitely recommend this product especially given the affordable price.", "After shampooing, I applied this to my towel dried hair and left it on for three minutes. I rinsed thoroughly and blow dried and styled. I thought it left my hair manageable, shiny, and non-greasy. I also thought my hair seemed to have more body.I normally do not use the same products for an extended period of time to avoid build-up of a product. However, I liked this product so much that I plan to work this into my product rotation.", "The whole line of Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion products is infused with Argan Oil giving incredible shine and softness. The scent is a nice, spicy fragrance.I love the whole Moroccan line. I've been using the shampoo, conditioner and styling oil and now the conditioning mask. I've had wonderful results with it. My hair is soft, bouncy, shiny and smooth.Use the conditioning mask instead of regular conditioner; use the mask one or twice a week for extra conditioning.", "\"My hair did feel softer but I needed to shampoo more often than normal because it felt \"\"heavy\"\" after a day.  As far as more shine that has never been an issue for me so there was no noticeable difference.\"", "\"\"\"Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask\"\" is a very reasonably priced deep conditioner that promises to deliver brilliant shine and long-lasting benefits. It seemed to be an excellent choice for everyday conditioning, but - for me - was not as effective as other deep conditioners.Chemically processed or more mature hair may become more dry and brittle. Refreshing the color - even when the product contains no ammonia - regularly may add to the problem. Many current styles require a sleek and smooth surface. Using \"\"Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask\"\" did not significantly improve my hair's surface appearance. A small amount was all that was needed; less than a tablespoon was sufficient. However, flyaway pieces and broken hairs were still evident. This product did not, ultimately, deliver the promised shine or conditioning benefits detailed in the product description.\"\"Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask\"\" did have some major benefits. After using the product, my hair still moved freely; it felt light and very soft. There was no indication that my hair would quickly become \"\"greasy\"\" in appearance. This product has a light, pleasant fragrance that is difficult to identify; it is not floral, nor is it spicy. It would be suitable for use by both men and women.\"\"Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask\"\" would be a good, reasonably priced everyday conditioner. If your hair is chemically processed - colored, highlighted, or straightened - you should consider this product.\"", "I used this product just as the manufacturer recommended. I first shampooed my hair with Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo , then I applied the conditioning mask. I left in on for 5 minutes (the longest recommended time) to be sure. I rinsed and let it air dry for a while, then blew dry it the rest of the way.My hair is color treated and very long (lower back), it is on fairly bad shape and I was really looking forward to having softer, smoother, shinier hair. I did not get my wish. If anything my hair is even dryer, duller and more fly-away than it normally would be with my Nexus shampoo and conditioner.It has a faint fragrance that is not unpleasant, but nothing too special or long lasting.Oddly the regular conditionerSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 ozleft my hair in better condition.", "Great stuff, really conditions seriously beat up hair, but it rinses much better than other conditioners and serums I've tried.Argan is the miracle supplement du jour and it lives up to the hype.And it's from Suave, so it's guaranteed to be among the lowest-priced.", "\"Perhaps I've become a hair product snob in recent years (at least, thinking myself too good for Suave) but even with this being in the Professionals line with the fancy Moroccan word on it I wasn't sure it would be much more than a bargain level hair mask.Now, while this isn't at what you'd get at the salon/salon price level, this truly packs a respectable punch when it comes to deep conditioning.One of my favorite aspects is this is a \"\"quick treatment\"\", giving results only after a few minutes' of the application.  I tried once leaving it on longer, but noticed no significant benefits, so this is definitely a product where a few minutes are all you need.My one concern is how different from most other hair masks I've seen.  This is more like a conditioner--which is fine in and of itself, but I don't know if \"\"mask\"\" is even close to being the best way to describe it.  I don't think it delivers the same benefits as a mask, though it's great as a deep conditioner.\"", "It smells like some kind of conditioner you'd buy at a salon, but for twice the price.  Put some in your hands, and it feels like any other condition you've used.  Start rubbing it in your hair, and suddenly the difference can be felt:  this stuff is thick.  Lathering it into my hair, it was almost like rubbing thick pudding through my hair.  Not immediately pleasant, but you could tell good things were in store!And they were!  After rinsing it out of my hair (and off my back, where it felt like I had rubbed petroleum jelly or something), my hair was very soft, very light-feeling, and...maybe had some added shine.All in all, this is good stuff for both the performance and value.  Would recommend!", "Not only does this conditioner do what it promises, which is to impart a little extra shine to your hair, but the scent is absolutely amazing. It reminds me of incense. It's got this deep, spicy scent to it that is nothing short of exotic. It's a nice creamy conditioner; it leaves my hair soft and shiny and smelling divine. I am a convert. I will be buying this from now on. I feel like I am truly getting salon quality for a very fair price.", "I have actually thought about giving some of this to my friends in an unmarked bottle to see what they think without showing them it is an inexpensive brand.  I love this conditioner!  I think it makes my hair feel so soft!  Very competitive with much more expensive brands.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to have silky smooth hair.", "I have loved the Moroccan infusion line by Suave. I have been impressed with the quality. Of all the products this is my favorite.Combing this through towel dried hair and letting it sit is the best way to use it. It is very moisturizing. It rinses out thoroughly and leaves hair shiny and feeling healthy. It is more concentrated than I am used to Suave products being so you don't need much.I did notice that when I used this on two occasions too close together that my hair felt greasy and oddly enough staticky. But I have had no problem using it on a more spaced out schedule.It's a good conditioner for the price.", "\"Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask was a solution I tried after using the shampoo from Suave Professionals which I recently reveiwed.I expected a very good result after applying this, which was my solution to the continuing sage of my terribly damaged \"\"old-person who started dyeing her hair for the heck of it way too young because she was foolish\"\" long yet questionable attempt at repairing what some call their \"\"crowning glory\"\". You want to know what I look like now, don't you? Relax. I look a 61 year old bleached scraggly haired regular person who will not GIVE UP.So I applied a good amount of this (I needed MORE PRODUCT, you know?) and waited the requisite time. You are only supposed to need to use this mask two times a week. I need it around every five minutes. Either that, or it just does NOT work for me. Big disappointment as a \"\"more product needed\"\" solution to the shampoo.If I could recommend a product which works better for me than both this, the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask , and the shampoo, it would be this: Suave Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil. I have a review over there of it.I don't know what your hair problem is, but mine is very dry hair. Using that Suave Argan oil, NOT this, helps me.best wishes,jean\"", "This conditioner works well, it covers the hair well, a little can go a long way.  I did notice that my hair has more shine to it since using this product.  The conditioner has a pleasant smell.", "I immediately became a little obsessed with the scent of this product. It may be the Moroccan argan oil. Or just some factory manufactured scent. The where doesn't matter, as the smell is nothing short of intoxicating. It's musky while remaining feminine. It's also very strong and noticeable. My hair smelled of this conditioning mask until my next shower, no matter what I had done in between. It never dissipated.It softened my hair and made it more manageable. Less knots, less frizz, and a small increase in shine. My hair is extremely over-processed from both dye and heat, so showing any improvement is rare.I am very, very pleased with this deep conditioning mask and will be purchasing it in the future.", "One of the prettiest things about my wife has always been her hair. So I never complain when she wants to try out something new.According to her , Suave has done it again. Another great value - priced product to keep her hair looking it's finest.Well , I guess there will be yet another bottle of hers in the shower !", "This suave professional Moroccan deep conditions shine mask has replaced my $40 salon product. I get excellent shine without a weigh down from this product. It smells great and I no longer have to use an anti frizz product. The most affordable product I've liked in years.", "\"I actually got this conditioning shine for my foster son's daughter Kayla, 17, who lives in my place with her Dad. Kayla is graduating high school in June and she wants to be a model. Three years ago she dyed her blonde hair brown, then black. She wanted to return permanently to blonde and went through two sessions to get it back to her normal color. She was very concerned about the state of her hair, its softness and shine. Her verdict: this is JUST WHAT SHE WANTED and NEEDED: \"\"It left my hair feeling great and it had a nice shine.\"\" And she will be buying more of it when the supply runs out.
