My face turned orange nearly instantly. It was also very greasy (and I have dry skin), and while in the summertime I might be able to get away with wearing a really small amount of this for a slightly \"\"tan\"\" look, it's way too greasy for that.

The first was an expensive, department store brand and I *hated* it. I love this L'Oreal BB cream. The texture is light, and made my skin look and feel soft and smooth. It had a pleasant smell. It was so easy to apply and blended in instantly. I think I'll be using this product for a while. Highly recommended!", "\"My wife tried to use this product but after 3 or 4 attempts got rid of it.  She thought it would be a real time-saver to be able to use a tinted moisturizer for those days when she doesn't want to put on \"\"full make up\"\".  It is on the thick side as it comes out of the tube and smooths on face easily, but the tint doesn't show as she applied it, so no matter how careful she was to put it on evenly it ended up being darker in some areas.  Once it changes color it's almost impossible to even out, plus it turns a sort of orange color instead of a natural color.

All of them seem to do different things and have a slightly different purpose. Since BB Cream stands for \"\"Beauty Balm\"\" it is really left up to the interpretation of the brand. This BB Cream Nourishes, Redensifies, Evens, Perfects and Boosts Radiance. It also contains SPF 20 and a skin tone matching cream. I am really loving this BB Cream and I will be using it for when I want a natural look.This color is a perfect match for my light-medium skin that has reddish undertones. I was able to apply the cream easily with very little blending. It did not make my face look orange, or even like I was wearing makeup. It does have a very light coverage. If you are wanting to look \"\"made up\"\", then this is not the BB Cream you want. If you want to look like a natural, ageless beauty then this is your BB Cream.It made my face look like it would if I had perfect genes and gorgeous, clear skin. It hid my red spots, uneven skin tone and rosacea. It did make my oily skin feel slightly greasy and look slightly shinny when I first applied it. However, an hour later my skin looked WAY better than it would have without this BB Cream. It wasn't near as oily or shiny as it normally is. I was even more impressed with this cream after working a 10 hour shift. My skin was not only NOT greasy or shiny, but it still looked flawless. It didn't have the usual blotchy red spots and shiny t-zone that it normally does after work.This is now my 2nd favorite BB Cream (Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Mediumis still my favorite due to it's better coverage). I use this when I am working or going to an event where I don't want to look like I am wearing makeup. This is more of an everyday BB Cream. For the price, you can afford to wear this one everyday! I only wear the other one when I am dressing up for events and want to look special.PROS:-evens skintone-SPF 20-moisturizes-GREAT price for a BB Cream-makes skin look naturally gorgeousCONS:-very light coverage-looks slightly shinny when you first apply itOverall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win. For the cheap price it is definitely worth trying.

The soft, pale petal pink color disappeared nicely when applied as a test to my inner wrist.  Then, I applied this BB Cream to my face!  Almost immediately the color changed to a sickly, yellow-orange that was similar to the color produced by self-tanning products in the early 1970's.\"\"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\"\" was a major disappointment.  Although it was not too heavy and applied smoothly, the resulting color was atrocious.  The jaundiced look is less than desirable.  The fragrance of \"\"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\"\" is quite strong.  That might have been tolerable, if the product had not resulted in a sickly appearance.  Further, based on the packaging, it does not appear this product is hypo-allergic.I cannot recommend \"\"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\"\".  The radical color change when applied to skin is unacceptable.\"", "The color matching technology didn't work for me.  It leaves an orangey colored cast on my skin.  I usually purchase fair/light for BB creams, and ivory for foundations.  My skin has a red undertone, not yellow, and the color just never adjusted well for me.  The texture is great, and the coverage would have been perfect for me if the color had been a good match.  I love that it has SPF 20, the tube is easy to use and just wish that it worked for my skin tone.", "\"I've always wanted to try a BB cream, and this arrived as an accidental \"\"free\"\" item through the Amazon Vine program, so I thought I'd try it. I'm 41 years old, white with very pale skin, somewhat splotchy from dry spots and aging, a couple of scars from surgery and injury, but a decent complexion even if I only use a concealer, tinted moisturizer and a little powder. I got this thinking it would replace my tinted moisturizer but it didn't. I admit, I'm baffled by this product, so I looked up the use of BB cream in some cosmetics videos, and tried it in several different ways:1. As makeup, i.e. replacing my tinted moisturizer -- It was luminous, so much so it was almost as shiny as the special makeup products I buy to deliberately create shine (like Watts Up!, etc.). But it didn't give me enough coverage, and was so thick that the powder clumped when I dusted my face. It also was thick enough to remove the concealer I had put on before using the BB cream (as recommended by a couple of how-to videos I had watched). I used it before putting on concealer and foundation once and that was just a joke, it was so thick I felt like my face was going to crack.2. Tinted sunscreen -- This was the best use I found for it so far. I put it on before being outside a couple of hours instead of using any makeup, and it lasted just fine, even after sweating. Again, though, no coverage to speak of.3. Moisturizer -- It didn't moisturize enough to replace my current moisturizer. If I put it on after letting my Loreal Age Perfect moisturizer soak in a little, it worked well enough, but again it just didn't provide enough coverage for me to feel fully comfortable. The color of the light-medium shade does seem to adjust to your own skin tone, but to a lighter shade, especially when used with the Age Perfect moisturizer. Since I'm already quite pale, it made me look almost like I was trying for a Goth look.After using it on my face after my current moisturizer for a few days, I broke out, because it is kind of thick and on the oily parts of my face, it's a little too much. Basically, I'll toss this in the drawer with my other sunscreen, and use this for days when I need to be in the sun for yard work or home repairs, because it's decent enough coverage for an emergency run to the hardware store, not so much for going out to eat.\"", "\"It's too early to determine the long term effects of this product,but after a few days of initial use, I am pleased. My \"\"mature skin\"\" felt soft and the skin tone was more even. The label reads that the long term results will be positive. I also like that broad spectrum SPF 20 will protect my skin during my year round sunshine.\"", "So I have very dry, but very fair skin.  I want a product that will moisturize and give a little spf at the same time.  This BB cream goes on well and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.  I like that aspect of it, and having a quick out the door option to doing a full blown makeup application.I do not like the 'radiance' aspect of the BB cream.  When you apply it, it has little to no color.  After being on your skin for a few minutes it turns into a more foundation-like color with some shimmer.  I find it collects along my eyebrows and leaves weird glittery brown streaks along my eyebrows that I have to remember to blend with a sponge.  It doesn't really provide much coverage - my dark under-eye circles and rosacea are still fairly obvious, but it does kind of even my skin tone and make the blotches less obvious.  I feel slightly shiny with this product and I find I have to use a little powder on my nose, chin and forehead.It is better than other BB and CC creams I have tried.", ". A real disappointment. I like bb creams a lot and this is my least favorite of about 10 that ive tried. The light color is just too orange and dark for my fair skin. The coverage is so light it did nothing to hide mild redness. I dislike strongly scented products and this one is very perfumey. Finally this is a bb cream that has a very shiny dewy finish and I prefer less shine.If you are pale I recommend the Ponds bb cream instead.", "First, I'm African American and did not care the least about sunscreen but I didn't know what I was missing. My skin is glowing and I'm not pregnant. My skin is evening out and stays looking soft, supple and sexy. This is the FIRST moisturizer I will re-purchase when I'm done with it. It's thick, concentrated and it totally dissolves in into your skin. When I first put it on I hated it, I thought it was to thick and would just sit there messing up my makeup. Within 20 seconds it was gone and my makeup went on flawlessly. It smells great. I love it. Give it a try.", "\"Yes, I have mature skin! My skin is very light in color, and fair.And, yes, I accept that fact that it is mature (it is the only thing about me that is, so what the heck)!Despite the acceptance of it, I don't do much about my skin except wash it, then if it feels \"\"tight\"\" I sometimes mosturize it. I love feeling pretty, but I cannot spend all day \"\"working it\"\".Perhaps you are like me.Here is some more info:I have very sensitive skin. I don't like the feel of heavy coverups or heavy makeup, although I pull out all the stops when I am going out to some sort of party, as far as eye make up is concerned.

It is simply a light wash of luminous moisture which evens out my skin tone and does very little more. You put it on, you stay in, perhaps you go out...either way, you are comfortable. And you don't look frightful! It's a good product.thanks,jean\"", "I liked this BB cream much better than the Ponds. The Ponds BB cream made my skin look somewhat dry. This didn't do that. Instead it gave my skin a nice smooth coverage, and it helped with the undereye circles. The finish is just much nicer than what I received with the other cream. I think the reason for this may be because I have mature skin, and so I have all kinds of imperfections that need to be covered. This glides on smoothly, covers up a lot of the flaws, and as I said before, helps with the undereye circles. It also works really well if you combine it with the Age Perfect SPF skin cream, which I also received. I highly recommend this if you have mature skin, want a good coverage without a product that is sticky. It works really well and not only goes on nice and smooth, it makes your skin feel nice and smooth.", "While I ordered L'Oreal SPF 20 Age Perfect Instant Radiance BB Cream, 2.5 Fluid Ounce, I actually got L'Oreal Paris, Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin.  However, I decided to keep the product and not complain since I was going to get some Day Cream anyway.  This product did not burn or cause any sensitivity issues for me.  The cream is more light than thick and covers quite well.  It brightens, does seem to hydrate and helps with age spots.  The scent is not good or bad but I wish there was no scent at all.

It starts out a pale pink, and \"\"transforms\"\" into a light/medium shade. The problem?  The light/medium shade is TOO YELLOW. (Much less so that the Youth Code medium shade, but still, too yellow is too yellow.)I wish more BB creams (and even foundations for that matter) made truly neutral BEIGE shades ranging from light to deep. Too many of them have this yellow thing going on.Now, if you happen to have more yellow undertones than I do, this might look fine on you, and you might rate it five stars.

The age perfect goes on like  expensive moisturizer.  It is much thicker and creamier then the Magic BB cream and works much better on my mature skin.  I have some redness but overall pretty good skin for a 'mature' lady.  This is for minimal coverage with a soft and luminous glow.I have used the BB creams from Korea and also the BB cream from Clinique.

First of all, if you are new to BB creams as I am, BB stands for Beauty Balm or Beauty Blemish.  I have been using BB creams for approximately three months.  I will compare the different BB creams I have been using to give a more accurate review of this particular BB Cream.  I am 56 years old, have a fair complexion, and have always taken good care of my skin.  I don't suntan and I have used a moisturizer with sunscreen since I was 17.  The first moisturizer that came out with an SPF factor was Oil of Olay.  I use a moisturizer twice a day.  I use a special thicker moisturizer at night.  I also use a glycolic peel every three days that I get from Avon.  I say all that so that if you are looking to use a BB cream, the BB cream is for people with good skin. BB creams are not for people with pigmentation problems, or redness or roughness, or severe acne scars.  It isn't heavy enough to cover those problems.  BB cream basically is a tinted moisturizer.  It does not give you the coverage that a regular foundation will.  I like the BB cream, because for years, I only used foundation in my T zones, (forehead, nose and chin).  As I have aged and because I have fair skin, I am beginning to have dark circles under my eyes.  And one eye has a lovely blue vein that you can now plainly see and I'm just thrilled about it.  So, when I began to notice BB creams, I thought that this would be good for my skin.  I like the idea of a tinted moisturizer.  I think foundation suffocates your skin and clogs your pores, so the idea of a lighter option to foundation sounded good.  I began using Avon BB flawless ideal with SPF 15 sunscreen and really liked it.  Unfortunately, they no longer sell it.  Then after many videos on You Tube and countless internet searches, I decided to purchase Garnier BB Cream in fair/light with SPF 15.  It also has vitamin C plus mineral pigments.  There were several good reviews on the Garnier.  I liked the Garnier.  It has a good consistency, light color and really covers my skin with a lovely highlighted look.  It makes my skin look better.  Then I had the chance to try the L'Oreal BB cream.  I have the Light/Medium and it has a SPF 20 Sunscreen.  It says on the box that it has a 5-in-1 beautifying action:  It nourishes, redensifies, evens, perfects and boosts radiance.  It has vitamin C and soy seed protein.  The Garnier is fair/light and the L'Oreal is light/medium.  So you would think the L'Oreal would be a bit darker when in fact it is quite a bit lighter.  It is so light that after I have applied the L'Oreal all over my face, I have to use the Garnier BB cream to cover my nose.  Overall however, I like the texture, it blends beautifully into my skin, it looks natural, I don't look made up, and it does have a bit more sunscreen.  The Garnier has a slight smell, whereas the L'Oreal does not have any fragrance that I can detect.  The Garnier is $10.92 for 2.5 fluid ounces and the L'Oreal is $12.59 for 2.5 fluid ounces.  Frankly, the best BB cream I have used is my own foundation, Cover Girl, mixed with my favorite Avon moisturizer.  So, in conclusion, BB creams are great and all of the above are good.  If I had to pick just one, it would be the one I make myself.", "\"Loreal Age Perfect SPF 20 for Mature skin is a creamy moisturizer that slightly tints the skin.

What does this mean?The three active ingredients are listed on the tube.  I am not a scientist so I suggest that many reading this review may want to learn more. Look up Octocrylene, one of the ingredients on Wikipedia.

On me, it's good for quick natural, casual no-makeup look with just mascara and lipstick.The daily use of sunscreen prevents dark spots from darkening further so using this for it's SPF20 on casual days IS a good thing. My skin feels soft like a moisturizer's been used BUT my skin couldn't handle a foundation or powder on top of it without feeling SMOTHERED.
