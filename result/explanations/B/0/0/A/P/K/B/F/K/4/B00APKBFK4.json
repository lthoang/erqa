"], "reviews": ["\"Oh I LIKED this!! Knorr Pasta Sides Thai Sweet Chili was a very pleasant way to eat lunch on a lazy Saturday. It cooked up in no time, the noodles swam around in the sauce insteed of clumping together, and the finished product (less than 15 minutes from pouch to pot to dish) delivered The Thai Food Experience -- the kind of Thai heat that rolls in easy on the tongue, building up to an intensity with undulations of sweetness -- a zesty spicy hot flavor, followed closely by a sweet unfolding of even more flavor. The bits of vegetables and ginger in the mix added substance and texture and more taste to this gustatory experience.I would defnitely buy Knorr Pasta Sides Thai Sweet Chili again, and the next time I cook it, I would add freshly shelled peas to the cooked mixture, to add crunchiness and more flavor \"\"pow\"\". I might even follow the recipe printed on the back of the pouch too.This pouch makes 2 servings. The Sodium count is a little on the high side (820 grams per serving) but not too high.\"", "I have enjoyed other flavors of these Knorr Pasta Sides, but this one is my favorite.  I do like oriental noodles, which this has, and I added a few drops of sesame oil to  this and some ground chuck, and it was really good.  The sauce is just spicy enough and it does have that delicious Thai flavor.  I can highly recommend this and will be buying more of it, provided I can find it in local stores.", "I love Thai food, but didn't think this was anything close to it -more Chinese than anything.  It tasted fine, was easy to prepare, but had a heck of a lot of salt that I thought it didn't need.  Personally I'd have liked more ginger and more chili as those flavors weren't on the forefront on my mind when eating, just the salt.PROS:+++ VERY QUICK AND EASY TO MAKE.  All you really need is water and 7 minutes of boiling.++ ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS.  The main ingredient is wheat flour, and I didn't find anything unnatural in the ingredients list that shouldn't have been there.+ HEALTHY-ISH.  Aside from the high salt content, there wasn't much offensive on here.  It has 3 grams of fiber per serving, which is great for pasta, and actual flavors from real food -like carrots, garlic, onions, and ginger.  (If you use this dish as a base for other vegetables that you throw in, then this could be a winner.)CONS:-- HIGH SALT CONTENT.  I thought the salt was almost overpowering.  I'd have been thrilled with half that amount.  If you ate the whole package it contains around 70% of your entire daily salt intake, which was just too much for me.Overall it tasted fine, and might be worth a try if you are a fan of the quick-cook noodle dishes, but I'd definitely add a protein or additional vegetables to give it a more balanced flavor and to make better use of all the salt.", "I'm not a big cook; I only dabble in it! So I have relied on easy mixes like this in the past and have a pretty good frame of reference for them. This one cooked up super easy and was tasty. I like that the only ingredient you really need is water; the oil is optional. I liked the ginger taste here and the addition of sesame oil, as it's quite healthy for you. The dish is high in thiamine, folic acid and niacin, too.The size and shape of the pasta in this product is interesting -- almost like a cross between spaghetti and rice. Or vermicelli, perhaps. There is a sweetness and a spiciness in the first bite. You can taste the ginger, and it does seem Thai-influenced. Overall, a good product.", "This Thai 'sweet' chili is actually a bit on the hot side.  With Thai noodles, chili and other spices, it makes for a nice lite lunch.  I enjoyed my portion and might consider buying it at the supermarket.", "I love Thai food, so I was looking forward to receiving a sample.  This pasta dish was just okay.  It is slightly sweet and a little tangy too.  And it has spices like garlic and ginger and soy sauce.  But it is definitely not as good as noodles you can get from a Thai restaurant.  Maybe I was asking too  much from this dish.  I can only give this a mild thumbs up.", "Convenience in the kitchen is important in my household and for that reason, I often seek out food items that require very little preparation, are good tasting, and hopefully offer a decent level of nutrition. The latter quality is not always possible, but if the product is easy to make and at least tastes good, there is a good chance it could make its way into the family meal rotation.The desire for the quick and simple led me to sample Thai Sweet Chili Lo Mein, from Knorr. The preparation for this product is quick as expected and there is little need to do much of anything. You just heat some water, stir in the contents, simmer, and serve. Other than a few quick stirs, there is little else to do.So, the product passes the convenience test, but what about the taste? Well, I find it average overall and the type of food most will forget they ever tried. The noodles are tender, but the problem for me is that the seasoning is a little too weak. It doesn't remind me of Thai food, or at least not a very good Thai food. The spice is not as sweet as expected and is a little blander than I prefer.Thai Sweet Chili Lo Mein could be redeemed if served with something more assertive. It really is intended as a side dish anyway, and as long as the other food you serve it with has a good deal of character, these noodles could find themselves a home. Otherwise, this is a very average food that has some redeeming qualities, but not enough to win over most consumers.", "I received this product as a sample for the purpose of writing a review and I liked it so much, I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy some more.I tried the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wrap recipe, which can be found on the packet.  It's terrific.  My girlfriend, who thought that she wouldn't like it, gave the recipe a 10 on a 10 scale.To make the recipe, simply simmer the product for 7 minutes while cooking 1 pound of ground chicken.  I substituted ground turkey, which worked out well.  Then, combine meat with the Knorr product and add some fresh lime.  Scoop into lettuce shells and throw some crushed peanuts and cilantro on top.  That's it.  It's a cheap and easy recipe to make that will likely impress.I like this product a lot.  5 stars.", "My idea of sweet chili is a hotter but slightly sweet taste.  At least that is what Thai food I've had has tasted like.  While this dish is certainly tangy, it isn't very spicy hot, although there is a nice tangy aftertaste when first eating this food.  This tang doesn't increase with intensity, either.There isn't much to this packet, though.  It's angelhair pasta with flavorings.  A few rehydrated carrot pieces show up, but it's mostly pasta. While the packet says this serves four people, for me it's a single pasta serving when eaten alone.I followed the stove top directions, which were super easy.  After seven minutes of simmering in just-boiled water, the contents are left to cool for a few minutes and then are ready for consumption.  I added a tablespoon of olive oil, proving me noodles that were just right for eating.", "This pasta was very easy to prepare and took less than 15 minutes from start to finish. The seasoning mix contains ginger and it's flavor is distinct and noticeable. The overall flavor was just okay. It wasn't bad, but I would not prepare this dish again for my family.", "\"This Knorr \"\"Thai Sweet Chili\"\" has a good Thai flavor that is somewhat on the sweet side and has just a little spicy heat to it. We eat a lot of Thai food and this easy to make side dish, while far from authentic tasting, it is quite passable.We chose to make it in the microwave and it cooked up perfectly. This is a packaged as a \"\"side dish\"\", so there is not enough to use this as an entree but it might be enough for a quick snack.I found the spiciness to be well below my tolerance and my wife said it was just right for her.Recommended!CFH\"", "I think this version of Thai is to get more people on board with tasty spicy food. Only it's not spicy enough, no bite. And just a hint of sweetness, sugar sweetness. The sugar is probably to adapt to the palates of more people but masks the onion, garlic and sesame that should instead be emphasized.Still, I would be happy to eat lots of this pasta sides as I like it.", "I was very pleased with this flavor of the Knorr Pasta Sides. I've tried a couple of other ones, but this really stood out as a clear winner.The flavor is very good, and the ginger taste comes through cleanly but does not overpower the dish. There's a nice level of spice to it - enough to feel the warmth, but not so spicy that it sears your mouth. An excellent middle ground.The low mein noodles are just OK. Nothing horrible, but nothing special either. Still, the seasoning more than makes up for a rather so-so noodle.Very easy to prepare. It's a simple, one-pot dish that is ready in less than 10 minutes.I would definitely pick this up again, and try it out as a foundation for a main course meal rather than just as a side dish. Excellent taste considering this is a meal in a pouch.", "Prep is predictably easy. Follow the directions and add the contents of the package, water, and oil(optional). Cook and in ten minutes or so it's ready.If you are planning to eat this as it is packaged as a 'side' this is nothing special. I found it more sweet than spicy when i sampled it alone. I added some red pepper flakes and chopped fresh basil and some leftover flank steak. With chopped peanuts sprinkled on top, this still wasn't anything that approximated the Thai food we eat at our favorite Thai place. However, the added ingredients tempered the sweetness and it tasted pretty good for faux Thai.Overall, I don't think I would serve this as a side unless I planned to doctor it up because I really didn't like the sweetness. Adding additional ingredients improved the overall taste.", "This Knorr side dish has surpringly good flavor with just the right amount of spice.At first this looked like Mrs. Grass soup that was so cheap and salty, but a great memory from long ago. The pasta cooked up doesn't look great. The thin short noodles don't look very good, or very Thai. Close my eyes and taste these noodles is a different story. There is a little bit of a kick, with a bit of lime flavor. For something that takes one and a half cups of water and boiling for six minutes, this is a darn good side dish.", "The Thai Sweet Chili pasta sides are Lo Mein Noodles in a spicy sweet chili sauce. To us, they kind of just taste like a Ramen noodle with an Asian flavor. My seven year said it tasted like Ramen noodles with soy sauce. He did give it a thumbs up. I could taste the ginger.They are an ok side. I wasn't crazy about the flavor or texture but I'm not a big noodle or ginger fan anyway.", "\"I enjoyed that this dish was quick and easy to make -- water, seasoning, noodles, done.It tasted just fine (not spectacular). Instead of serving it as a side, I mixed in some veggies and Gardein Chick'n, and it was good.My only issue is that the noodles were all so short -- like 1\"\" long.  It was weird.  I guess I was expecting longer noodles.  Not a big deal.Anyway, definitely a step up from quick serve meals like Ramen -- but I found some of the other (slightly more expensive) pasta/thai products to be tastier.  For something that's only $1.50, this is good.  I just prefer something a step up.\"", "\"This is a relatively convenient instant pasta product. It was easy to make and it took me about ten minutes from the time I start preparing it until it was all done. You juts need to pour the content of the package into 1.5 cups of boiling water and leave it on simmer for about seven minutes. The pasta is creamy and fairly spicy, as you could expect from a mean that involves sweet chillies. It didn't taste at all like some other \"\"boxy\"\" instant meals that I've tried over the years. On the other hand the pasta was fairly plain, and in general I would recommend making it with some additional ingredients - stir-fired vegetables, shrimp, meat, or tofu. Otherwise, not bad for an instant meal.\"", "I decided to take the easy way out and put this in the microwave for the suggested 11 minutes. The result was a pasta that seemed to be cooked to just the right texture. I grabbed a fork and started to down a sample. It is sour and a pucker is not out of the question. There is a fairly mild tingy taste as well but it is not able to overcome the sourness. I can't really say that ths is bad because there are some who may like this type of taste but for me it is a no no. Sour pasta is just not on my want list.", "I made this with a little bit of precooked chicken. It was great I loved it and so did my kids. The sweet chili taste was very good. Very easy to make. I will make this again.", "I enjoy cooking and can be found in the kitchen preparing family meals on those days my wife does not wish to be there. I find that, for the most part, those dishes that really taste good require a little extra care and/or time in preparing and some days I am short of both.On days like these one of the alternatives I turn to is Knorr's line of food booster products, such as the Knorr Thai Sweet Chili choice.  This pre-mixed pasta mix in a bag contains Lo Mein noodles with a spicy sweet chilli sauce and a touch of ginger.All you have to do is heat up water in a saucepan, add vegetable oil, and simmer for seven minutes until the noodles are tender. and then let stand for two minutes, and serve with whatever meat you chose as the main dish.  This mix goes well with beef and could be served as a side with tacos or as a standalone.My family, of course, knows that I relied on Knorr for this very tasty side dish to augment my meal offering that night but they love its taste just the same. No one cares that I didn't make it from scratch except that I care because I didn't have to invest the time and effort required to make it from scratch. A very easy and tasty meal helper aid.", "We love this Knorr Past Thai Sweet Chili Pasta side. It is not really like Thai food, but we love the sweet mildly spicy flavor. It is a great alternative to mac and cheese.

I will find this at the grocery story. Rather than adding oil, try a tablespoon of peanutbutter. I really loved this!", "I used the microwave directions with this mostly because I am generally suspicious of things that say stovetop OR microwavable.  Stovetop seems to cook things much better.  They are certainly more likely to be cooked thoroughly and warmed completely.This was fine with microwave cooking.  The lo mein noodles were cooked perfectly in 8, not 12, minutes.  I cut the time down because I don't like squishy or smushy lo mein noodles.I love Thai food but this was initially a little bland and I had to kick it up a bit with Thai chili powder, garlic, and onion.  Then it tasted more like Thai after I dumped a bunch of peanut sauce on it.Yes, I would buy this again, because it had the right amount for two servings and because it had a start on the flavors.  It made it really easy to end up with a tasty lunch for two.", "This flavor is alright but not their best one. It does have the Asian pasta flavor but I was expecting more kick to it for the chili part. It is definitely different from the other kinds I have tried. I always substitute 2% milk with skim milk. It turns out a bit watery but okay.", "The R&D gurus at Knorr's have a tough task.  They have to design a product that will appeal to a large segment of the marketplace and will offend very few.  Unfortunately, in their efforts to move towards the mean, the product they've developed lacks the needed pizzaz.  I expected Thai Sweet Chili to have that pizzaz; to have a pronounced flavor with enough of a bite to make it interesting.  Instead, it's neither bland nor spicy... I'd call it uninteresting.  It's simply just OK.  I finished it, but I won't be buying another.", "I've loved Chinese, Japanese, and Indian food for many years, but never had the opportunity to try Thai...This dish was just what the title implied--hot (tangy) and sweet...It definitely deserves to be consider if you enjoy different ethnic foods.There weren't many other items other than the noodles and sauce--a few specks of carrots to give it color...what I know is that I'd like to try this food in a restaurant where you could probably get more vegetables in the lo mein type of dish...This was also my first product from Knorr kitchens...definitely will try others by them since I use many prepared food packages as a single retired person...", "\"I have been busy since early this morning cleaning up now that my granddaughter has gone back to the UK, so instead of dirtying yet more dishes for a big meal I whipped up some Quick Pickle (thinly sliced cucumber & red onion, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar), basted a salmon filet with a bit of soy sauce, lime juice & fresh ginger and tossed thisThai Sweet Chili Knorr Pasta Sideat a saucepan for a nearly instant meal.A bit reminiscent of the Thai Peanut Noodle Salad my family adores (though it pales by comparison) this is very mildly spiced - and flavored. (Don't let that \"\"Thai\"\" in the name fool you - this has just a whisper of heat, nothing close to Thai-hot.)  I tossed in a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro for a flavor boost.Grandma's $0.02 - This one is OK, something children should find acceptable as a quick side dish with chicken, beef or fish.\"", "I had tried another Knorr Pasta side and hated it so I was a little leary of the Thai Sweet Chilli but it wasn't bad.First the instructions were easy to follow. I ended up with properly cooked noodles. Preparation was very quick and easy.Second, the taste is ok. It is not a resturant quality Thai dish but it has the sweet and hot flavors. It is a little tart as well. I had a handful of cilantro that I needed to use so I chopped that up and added it. It made a nice addition. This dish would make a great starting point for a quick dinner.", "The pasta cooks up nicely and the preparation is very easy. Quite simply, I didn't like this flavor. It is quite sweet and so the chili flavor isn't that strong, but the sweet ginger is overpowering. Less would have been more because the heavy ginger flavor ruins the pasta dish for me.", "\"I am not what you would call a picky diner, and I love almost anything with an Asian accent. That being said, the Knorr Thai Sweet Chili pasta sides failed to pass my most basic test: \"\"would you ever deliberately put this in your mouth again?\"\"While described as being in a \"\"Spicy Sweet Chili Sauce,\"\" my overwhelming sense was simply that the taste was sour. There's a hint of sweetness, but not enough to counterbalance the pucker factor of the tartness. As far as spicy heat, there was no initial sense of it - though after a few bites, my tongue discerned a slight warmth from the \"\"touch of real ginger.\"\"The Lo Mein Noodles are indistinguishable from basic spaghetti, and taste somewhat pasty. And you'd better eat or serve them while they're fresh, as the noodles will soon bond into a single gelatinous mass.I found the addition of some chicken, peanuts, and hot sauce an improvement...but truthfully, I'd still have been better off adding those condiments to a 15 pack of Ramen. In general, I like Knorr products - but this one isn't going back on my shopping list.\"", "\"When it is just as easy to make it from scratch?  In fact, not only as easy, but way better tasting.This can be as simple as buying lo mein noodles and a bottle of Thai Sweet Chili sauce and mixing to taste.  Add some chopped scallions and carrot, or sugar snap peas, or whatever veggies you have on hand--or none at all.  It would still be better that this packaged stuff.  Get creative and don't buy a bottle of sauce, just toss a little Sriracha sauce, quality fish sauce, vinegar or lime, and a bit of sugar and you have your own version of it.  If you like Thai flavors, you should really stock these items in your pantry anyway.The noodles in this packet turn out wimpy and the seasonings have no pizzazz.  Pass it by.
