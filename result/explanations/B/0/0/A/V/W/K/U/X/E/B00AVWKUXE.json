Thank you.", "need an antenna for farther distance...90miles or so??"], "reviews": ["I own two flat antennas.  The first, theMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate)- see my video review of that item to see how it works -  amplified with a 50 mile range, is what I use every day to pull in over-air HD channels in my area since cutting ties with Charter Cable. It works great for pulling in all the major networks, PBS and a few others.  About 14 total channels, which is what the antennaweb dot org folks say is available in my area.  The second, theWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antennaamplified with a 35 mile range (purchased at Costco), gets all but two of the channels.  We use that one in our home gym on a TV that is seldom used and the two missing channels aren't a big loss.WHY I BOUGHT THE SKYRecently the Leaf Ultimate lost one of the major network channels.  I did a channel autoscan and it didn't find it.  This was curious to me as it was being broadcast the closest to my home.  I had been curious about the Sky for a long time, wondering if a 10 mile range increase would help my signal and pull in signals from even farther away - which some have reported.What I found out was whether the Mohu Sky was mounted in the same spot as the Leaf Ultimate or in the attic, I got the same number of channels.  I would expect that if we lived in a more signal-rich area, I might have gained some channels.  The signal strength from all the channels I do get increased, with nearly all at 100%.  That was great, but I was really struggling with the additional one hundred plus dollars for an antenna that didn't give me any more channels than the current one.As I looked at the Mohu Sky I noticed the included 30' cable was considerably thicker than the one that came with the Mohu Leaf Ultimate.  I decided to do an experiment.CABLE SWITCH-A-ROOI put both antennas in the same spot (previously found to be optimum) in my living room.  I did channel scans for each with the cables they shipped with and noted that the Sky nabbed all the available channels with excellent signal strength, and the Mohu Leaf Ultimate grabbed all but two channels (the reason I had gotten the Sky in the first place was to recover the two channels...) and had signals ranging from 75-100% signal strength.I then put the thicker cable; the one that shipped with the Mohu Sky, on the Mohu Leaf Ultimate antenna.  I did a channel scan and recovered the two lost channels with nearly every channel at 100%.  Changing the cable to the thicker indoor/outdoor one, made the difference.THE LESSONFor me, in my location, I don't need to spend the extra money on the Mohu Sky and mount it on the top of my house in order to gain all the over-air TV in my area.  The 50 mile range on the Ultimate with a new cable did the trick!  I have ordered a triple shielded cable to replace the thin one that came with the Ultimate, and fully expect it will solve my signal loss issues.Is the Sky worth the extra money?  Yes, if you live in an area where broadcast signals are just out of reach, it's definitely worth a try!  But if, like me, you are getting the available ones, but losing channels occasionally and thought it might be the antenna, try upgrading the cable first. Replacing it for about ten dollars may be a cheap solution to your problem.The Mohu Refurbished Sky HDTV Antenna came boxed 'as new', with all the parts (including mounting hardware) and documentation.  It has a 90-day warranty and tech support is free and available via email and phone.  I would not hesitate to recommend Mohu refurbished units.  While the antenna had a few faint scuffs, it was nothing like a 'used' one.Like the other Mohu products, it's well made in the USA.  It works as expected and promised, and I have no hesitation recommending it to others who want to cut the cord with cable, but for my area - I just didn't need it.  What I did need, was an upgraded cable.NOTE:  I returned the Sky and bought a Mediabridge Coaxial Digital Audio/Video Cable (25 Feet) - Triple Shielded F-Pin to F-Pin with Easy Grip Connector Caps - White to use with myMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate).UPDATE: 4/23/14In response to questions about my over-the-air TV and use of Mohu antennas, I wrote a Kindle book:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV. Newbies to cord cutting will find it useful. I don't go into the setup of the Mohu Sky, but there is a step by step to setting up a flat antenna, and lots more info on OTA TV, supplemental programming and how to cut ties with cable.", "I cut the cord on Cable/DirecTV about 5 years ago and haven't regretted it since. I use over the air HDTV and a computer and Xbox connected to my TV to watch online TV on all the TV provider's websites, Hulu, Netflix and others. My bill went from $75-90 a month to $8.77 for Netflix. I'm a big fan.I've been using a HDTV multi-directional antenna in my attic pointed towards Nashville and receive all the main channels and a few additional ones. I'm pretty happy. But when I had the option to review this antenna I jumped at it because I'm always open to a better antenna or even a second antenna. What I found I rally liked!First this is very small compared to my other antenna and feels smooth and sleak. It is powered, which helped it bring in the signal. I really like that it comes with the power and the mast, both of which are things you may need to buy at extra cost if you buy most antennas. I also like the little things like how the cable is covered on the end and how the screw end for the TV is hashed for finger tightening.I plugged this in at the back of my house right by my TV (farthest from the signal) and was surprised to find that I was able to pick up a couple channels even on the first floor and through my house. This antenna works. In the attic next to my other antenna I found that it easily holds its own.This is a great antenna and it comes with everything you need to cut the cord and save yourself a bunch of money. I highly recommend it.", "\"I can give only a limited assessment of the basic _performance_ of this antenna because the rainy season ended early, and any true assessment needs to include bad weather (not just \"\"rain fade\"\" but effects induced by winds). Instead this review will focus on other aspects of the product.In considering this product, remember to factor in installation costs, both mounting the antenna and running the cable to your TV(s). After factoring in installation, a pricey, small, light-weight antenna may be cheaper than the alternatives. Or not. YMMV. Or it may allow installation in a location that provides superior reception.For _me_, the advantages overwhelmed the problems noted below, and hence my rating.----My situation:Most of broadcast antennas for the local TV stations are in two clusters 25-30 miles from me in the same direction, but some stations are in an antenna farm 120 degrees from that (based on AntennaWeb.org). All except one of the latter are in the \"\"Yellow\"\" zone (least demanding), and the exception is listed in the \"\"Red\"\" zone (4th tier) but behaves like all the other Yellows. However, my reception conditions are complicated by my neighborhood's many mature trees, oaks and similar, which are 50-60 feet, some taller.My previous antenna is a very old (30 years) traditional rooftop antenna (LPDA) about 10 feet above my 15-foot high roof (single story home). With recent growth of nearby trees, I am now losing reception on some channels during rainy periods, but have been deferring the difficult task of relocating a large antenna because those rainy periods have recently been few and the Internet provided a more than adequate alternative. Because the new antenna required a separate installation (below), I left the previous antenna temporarily in place for comparisons.----Warning: Do NOT expect to be able to using an existing rooftop antenna mast to mount this. (1) The typical rooftop mast has a diameter of 1.5 inches, and this uses a 1-inch mounting pipe. (2) This antenna cannot be mounted in the middle of a mast -- it _must_ be mounted at the very top of the mast/mounting pipe because the groove for the mast stops after a few inches (see the picture).Note: This mounting bracket is commonly used by satellite TV dishes and if you have an unused one installed, you _may_ be able to replace the dish with this antenna (also reusing its coax cable). Unfortunately, satellite antennas are often in a horrible location for terrestrial broadcasts.----Warning: The mounting bracket is ill-suited for what I would think would be the most common location: At the end of a peaked roof. If you look closely at the manufacturer's picture on the box of this mounted such a location, you will notice that that peak is different from the others in that it has a larger endcap for the mounting. Not a problem for me, it could be for others. In most cases, the change is trivial if you have basic skills and tools (cut a small piece of plywood to shape and paint it).Note: This same mounting bracket and tube is also used by several other manufacturers of small antennas.----Deficiency: The cable provided is 30 feet of RG-59 coax. RG-59 is intended only for short runs, such as between components (DVD player and the TV). For longer runs, such as from antennas, RG-6 cable is called for because it has lower signal loss. RG-59 gets used because it is cheaper, but also because it is more flexible (smaller diameter, less shielding) but that flexibility can be a problem because too sharp bends degrade the signal (I have forgotten the parameters). In planning your installation, measure the _actual_ route of the cable -- you may well find that 30 feet is not that long.----Antenna orientation: No advice from manufacturerBeing an multi-directional antenna does _not_ mean that it provides equally strong reception in all directions: Every antenna has lobes. Experimenting with what is the best orientation has been been baffling, with me getting different results for stations broadcast from the same antenna cluster (but with a range of RF channels*: 7, 12, 19, 29, 30, 38, 44, 45). I used the strength meter in my TV tuner. To get signal strengths down to where I could see changes, I temporarily lowered the height of the antenna (introducing unavoidable confounding factors). For some stations, the variability as a I rotated the antenna was no different from the variability seen while the antenna was stationary. For seemingly similar stations, there was a 20-40% difference. Perplexingly, sometimes the stronger signal was with the long edge pointing at the broadcast antenna (as in a LPDA antenna) and sometimes it was with being perpendicular.This suggests that the product integrates multiple basic types of antennas. This is not only unsurprising, but what I would expect from an antenna in this price range. However, I was surprised that seemingly minor/invisible differences made significant impact on best orientation. You may want to put the antenna in a location where you can experiment to see if some orientation is better before doing a permanent installation (which often tend to be in hard-to-access locations).Remember: Antennas are usually installed during good weather but reception problems are most likely to manifest themselves during bad weather.----Performance:In good weather (the only type I have had since getting this antenna), its performance matches or exceeds my previous antenna. During my initial testing with the antenna in a window facing the primary broadcast antenna cluster, it provided roughly the same reception (by the tuner's strength meter) as my rooftop antenna.Aside: This is advertised as being suitable for installation in an attic. Be aware that installation in an attic dramatically reduces an antenna's reception. The rule of thumb is that one rated to receive station up to 60 miles, such as this antenna advertises, should be reduced to 20 miles. Part of this is that various roofing materials, especially asphalt shingles, hold moisture long after the actual rain has passed and that residual moisture can absorb significant signal strength before it reaches the antenna. If outdoor installation is precluded, don't _assume_ that this will be offset by the (small) height advantage of attic installation over being in a room on the floor below -- experiment. Recognize that wall also have many YMMV factors (construction and types of insulation and vapor barrier). In this situation and depending on these many YMMV factors, you might find an in-room antenna such asLeaf Ultimate, or similar, is preferable over an attic installation. But high and outside is the default for good reason.----Instructions:The parts come in bags labeled with letters that match up to the instructions, eliminating any confusion about what to use. The instructions themselves are generally well-done, although there is some potential for miscues. Since the small size of this antenna encourages installation by DIYers with no previous experience, I included my quibbles and disagreements as an Appendix to this review.Additional tools for assembly (excludes mounting): small Philips screwdriver, adjustable wrench----Lightning threat and building codes:The product literature describes this antenna as \"\"lightning resistant\"\" but gives no details. The typical building code requires a grounding block near where the coax cable enters the building, but the provided cable implicitly discourages this. While people tend to think of the tradition rooftop antenna as similar to a lightning rod, my understanding is that part of the threat from lightning is the currents induced in the cable itself from nearby strikes. I am simply aware of the issue, but lack the expertise to assess the risks.----Design:Power injector box: Power for the amplifier inside the antenna is carried to it over the coax cable from this box that is located near the TV. This box is powered by USB (see the manufacturer's description) using standard, readily available parts : USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable and a USB Wall-plug Adapter (what the manufacturer calls the \"\"power cube\"\"). This makes replacement quick, easily and inexpensive should the need arise.The curves of the antenna seem to encourage water to run toward the coax cable connector. The seating for the weather-proofing boot is different from what I normally see: The lip is positioned on an insignificant cylinder. That cylinder can serve two purposes: additional friction to hold the boot in place and a larger contact area to maintain the seal if the boot deteriorates with age. The former is not needed by this antenna because the mounting tube provides more than enough pressure to keep the boot from slipping. However, I don't know about enough about materials to know about the latter. If the antenna is easily accessible for routine (annual?) checks, no worry (my situation). If it's in a difficult location, I would think about how to better protect it.----Shipping Packaging:Screws and some of the other small parts come in very thin bags. The bag for the mounting screws was inadequate to the task and several screws poked holes in it and escaped. Fortunately, this hardware was in a cardboard compartment that segregated it and thereby prevented damage to the finish on the antenna.---- APPENDIX: Notes on disagreements and improvements for the instructions ----Step 1: Installing the base mounting bracket on the roof, eaves, ...: The illustration can easily lead to the installation of the base bracket rotated 90 degrees from intended. Look at step 2 to determine proper orientation.Step 2: The \"\"mounting tube\"\" (their term, more commonly called a \"\"mast\"\" for antenna installations) has a bend at about 30% of its length. This allows the antenna to be positioned close-and-taller or further out and not as high. The installer should be alert to this option.Step 3: Attaching the coax cable to the antenna at this point might appear to be deferrable until later. However, attaching the antenna to the mounting tube (mast) in Step 5 is crucial to locking the weather-proofing boot in place (and I couldn't move the boot in position after the mounting had been tightened).Step 4: Attaching the bracket to the antenna. This could and should be done before Step 3. The instruction to \"\"loosely attach the nuts\"\" is an understatement -- the nuts need to be very loose to leave enough room to insert the mounting tube. The antenna is symmetrical and there are plenty of visual clues that it doesn't matter which side the bracket is mounted on, but this could well be mentioned in the written instructions.Step 5: Attach the antenna to the mounting tube (mast): Needs a reminder to check that the weather-proofing boot on the coax cable is properly seated -- it may well have come unseated during this process.Step 6: Run the coax cable from the antenna to your TV. I would argue that this should be done before Step 3 (attaching the coax to the antenna). Typically attaching the cable to the antenna is the _last_ step of the installation because repairing damage done by a jerk on the cable can be difficult or impossible to repair (I haven't disassembled this antenna to see how repairable it is). If you are going to attach the cable to the antenna earlier, you need to provide significant strain-relief and/or tie-down, which you will also need as part of the permanent installation (not documented). But if you have that installed, it will hold that end of the cable in position, so why not be reasonably paranoid and defer connecting the cable until the very end?---- Footnotes* Before the Digital TV transition, the RF channel number was the TV station's channel number, but with the transition many stations moved to different RF channels but kept the old number as a virtual channel number (to avoid confusion). For example, the station 02-1 in my area is now broadcast on RF channel 44.-- Douglas B. Moran\"", "Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna is easy to install and does a good job in bringing in the stations.  Picture and sound quality was very good with such a small antenna.  Depending on where you want this installed, installation for me was completed in around an hour and a half. That is because I replaced the old yagi up on the roof. This meant going on the roof several times.  Once to install and the others to adjust the signal strength.  Yes even though it is an omnidirectional antenna, you still need to play around with the Mohu's position. The TV stations signal towers sit on a mountain top just west of me with a distance of about 15-20 miles and I was able to pull in a good signal strength.  I will have to play around with the antenna's position for better strengths.  It is amplified, and for good signal strength, does require this to be powered up.  The antenna comes with all the parts needed to get it up and going.  Compared to my non-amplified antenna that I have installed inside the garage, I would say that the Mohu's picture quality is a bit better.  Price is on the higher side which is the one drawback on this little guy but it is nice to such a small footprint up there on the roof.  I would recommend this antenna for bringing in all those local channels.", "Ok, so I bought this Mohu Sky because I live in a rural mountainous area.  My neighbor uses a digital converter with rabbit ears and gets 2 channels.  One is weather and one local channel.  We have two stations within 5 miles.  I knew we only have several stations locally and was hoping with a good antenna I could bring in some that were further away (30ish miles), and substations, digitally.  I have a Smart tv, with tuner, a brand name.  I am using cable, not happy with the cost of basic package, and being charged extra for local channels!So anyway, I ordered it after researching, and realized it might be a bit much cost wise for what I would be able to pull in.  So I contacted Mohu by email and they can tell you what kind of performance you might expect.  I did this after I had purchased the Mohu Sky..  They were very honest.  I did not tell them I had already purchased the Sky.  There suggestion was, with no more than is available to me and because of the terrain surrounding me, the Mohu Leaf  would most likely suffice.Well, it's installed and the Sky is 25 feet off the ground, and I am able to pull in 9 stations.  Some I won't watch much, I grant you, but I do get Fox, CW, ABC, CBS, NBC etc...I couldn't get ABC on cable!  The stations that are transmitting in HD are awesomely clear.  I may have(or not) did overkill , but I am definitely happy with purchase, but mostly happy with the honest customer service! If I need further antenna's I will definitely look to Mohu first.  Might get the Leaf for the travel trailer...even though it has an old antenna on it.", "\"Over the air broadcast Television has the appeal of being free, but also can offer superior picture quality to cable television. The problem is that you need an antenna to receive it, and installing an external antenna is a hassle that most want to avoid. Mohu's Leaf Antenna is an attractive option for those relatively close to broadcast towers, and want something that blends in well in a home.I already own a Leaf antenna, and bought the separate Mohu \"\"Jolt\"\" amplifier. The amplifier does boost signal strength, but if you have signal drop problems with channels, it may or may not help. My experience has been that it stabilized one channel that had been marginal, but didn't help with signal drop on another channel which had been troublesome before. Signal Drop is where there is breakup in the channel - stutters and stops combined with pixelated images.The Sky is a bit more than an external version of the Leaf. It has a longer range and is contained in a weather proof housing. Positioning is not as crucial as the Leaf antenna, or other rooftop (or in this case also attic) antennas, particularly Yagi designs (a common antenna design that is directional). It is more akin to the Winegard Metrostar 2000/2002, which I have also used in the past (and which worked well). The Sky comes with all the mounting hardware necessary to mount on the eave of the house, or in your attic; all the necessary screws, the mount and 30 foot of coax cable. The antenna's power injector for the integrated amplifier is powered by USB, so it can be powered from the USB port of a TV set, or in my case, a Tivo. It also comes with a wall power adapter with a USB port in case you do not have the option to power it from another source.In all, the antenna works well. I am getting two more channels than I did before with the Leaf (which is no slouch itself). It is easy to install - the biggest issue is getting the cable itself into the house - if you go in the attic there is the possibility of running it through the walls. There are somewhat fewer signal droppage problems - not completely erased for my one \"\"problem\"\" channel, but overall improved. For someone who wants a simple solution to improving their over the air television experience, this is a very nice option, but I would also look at the Winegard 2000/2002. Unfortunately I am not able to test these side by side; the Winegard was left behind at my previous home.\"", "Nice product, seems well constructed, however, not great for my area. It is not the antenna's fault. My area has to many obstructions for the signal to work well.", "I had high hopes very high hopes for this antenna and spent an age trying to get it to work nicely.  But the bottom line is that our  four-year old (Antennas Direct DB2 Multi-Directional HDTV Antenna for $75)works much better.With the Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna, I could only pick up two channels and they weren't strong. The antenna amplifier didn't help at all. I hooked up our old antenna to the Mohu pole to compare the two but for some reason both actually worked better just hanging off the wall under the eaves. The Mohu did work better hanging from the wall too but it was not that great--I tried using minimal cable on both and both performed better (extra cable can cause interference).  Again, the Mohu worked about half as well as the old DB2 antenna. For the longest time, I couldn't even pick up our local PBS station.In the end I found that our old antenna without an amplifier, mounting pole or their cabling was best. It peaked at about 78% signal on PBS when the peak of the new Mohu was 40% and the old antenna consistently gets around 60% average.Originally I took the antenna straight outside. I was confident after reading all the great reviews that it would be great and hopefully perform better than our old one. When I couldn't get satisfactory results outside I hooked it up directly in the house next to the TV and watched the signal.  For some reason the Mohu performed better from two to three feet than it did from eight feet in the air. Performance wasn't that different than outdoors. I retried the amplifier which didn't seem to do a lot. I even tried the spare USB port on our media hub and my cell phone charger adapter after I wasn't sure if the Mohu one was producing any power. (There is no led or indicator to show that the amplifier is running).Anyway, the best I could get out of the Mohu was 5 channels, three of them being local news. The old DB2 picked up 27 channels including PBS.This was a huge disappointment as I was impressed with the build quality and materials used, plus the Mohu looks so much nicer. It also comes in good packaging with a sturdy mount and pole. Other than no indicator on the amp it felt like a good quality piece of electronics that actually screws together. Instructions were good and the whole process of setting up was straight-forward.Like I said at the beginning I really wanted this antenna to work. I read all the positive reviews and was quite excited. Perhaps I received a faulty unit or my location offers poor reception for this particular antenna. I live in a single story bungalow in a  small neighborhood between a railway and large river with levys on all sides. Perhaps these conditions weren't ideal but that doesn't explain why the DB2 gets 27 channels with a high signal strength.Like I said, maybe mine is a faulty unit but I can't give it a better score than two stars from my personal experience.UPDATE: We took up the Mohu support people on their offer and they shipped us a new antenna as advertised.  The customer support was superb.  Not only were they really friendly and prompt but they communicated with us in a real way.  And when we tried the new antenna indoors it did seem to work quite well.  It picked up the channels and the service was good.  Sadly, outside we ran into the same problem (though not as bad) as with the previous antenna, leading us to believe that the issue is the 50-year wiring in our house.  I asked my husband what we could do to give the antenna a proper test but, sadly it seems that apart from drilling holes and dealing with the wiring, there is not a whole lot we can do.However, given the fairly extensive testing we did inside, I would say that this antenna would work as advertised if our wiring was a bit more modern.", "I live in an area of the country monopolized by Cox Cable. It is unfortunate because their service is nothing short of awful. Reception...when it's on...tends to lag, drop and almost always results in a fuzzy picture. Heck, I had better reception with bunny ears back in the 70's.Initially we got this with the idea of putting it on our travel trailer since our old one had become obsolete (not a digital antenna). When this arrived we opted to test it out on a television at home before installing in the travel trailer. It should be noted, this is SUPER easy to hook-up; literally, it's the most simple antenna ever. Take it out of the box, plug in the wire...you are ready to go.So, figured we would test it and then WOW...better reception than Cox cable. NO exaggeration. In our area we only get about a dozen channels via air so may still use it on the tt after all but in the meantime, we did put in a somewhat snide little call to Cox letting them know (again) how horrid their service is. The ONLY reason we keep it is for the Internet connection (anyone have other ideas, please feel free to share them!).Absolutely terrific device. Easy to install. Easy to locate....we tried out 3 or 4 different spots just to see which would get the most signals...according to the website, our area is only expected to get 12 and we get 12, each crisp and clear despite the fact we have a lot of trees and it was a somewhat rainy day.Very impressed! I had never heard of this company before but will keep ane eye out for anything else they put out. Love it when a product works the way its intended. Also, far smaller than other big bulky attenna which have used in the past.", "I had the Leaf antenna in the attic. Every now and then (not very often) the audio would go out or the video would get choppy. I was hoping to get more channels with the sky, I don't. At least now the occasional choppiness is gone. If I knew then what I know now I probably would have just stayed with the leaf. Its installed in the attic so I don't know what kind of results you can get if it was outside.", "We received our Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna yesterday and were able to install and use it right away. Installation was simple and it easily found channels in our local area. We no longer pay for cable, so this is a great way to still get local programming. The best part is that the Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna brings in SUCH a clear picture! Truly HD.", "\"According to their website I could possibly pick 66 channels. Well I got a big 2 channels. I mounted it high on my roof and tried different directions. It came with 2 booklets for Install, but they were both in French I think. No English install booklet. All the screws were rusty. Maybe I should have just bought a new one and not a \"\"Factory Refurbished\"\". We'll see I might just by a new one and try again. I will update if I do. But as far as my first experience goes with this, blah.UPDATE:I did try messing around with it one more times before I packed it up. I moved the Antenna around on my roof and at one spot I was able to get up to 6 channels. But that was it. There were so many good reviews for it and according to Mohu I should have been able to get around 60 channels or so from my location. Here is a report of my towers for TV-Fool:[...]\"", "The Mohu Sky seems like a well-constructed product, however, the actual operation of the antenna is mediocre at best. Whenever there is any kind of wind in our area this thing breaks up so bad that I would rather turn my TV off because it just annoys the hell out of me. We live in Seattle about 15 miles at most from various TV towers and at best I am picking up about 20 channels. Which for the most part I am okay with, but the breaking up of channels while I watch something, I do not understand this. I would not recommend this antenna and would suggest people look elsewhere. There has got to be something better than this for the price. If you want an antenna that will give you a hell of a headache, then this is the one!", "I feel bad about being the only review here not giving the 'Mohu Sky' a 5-star rating.  Yet the point of this forum is sharing all sides; both positive and negative.  I still gave this antenna a 4-star rating.I just purchased four (4) antennas.  The Mohu Sky, the Mohu Ultimate Leaf and a Winguard (sold at Costco for $48 and a 'copy' of the Leaf).  The Mohu Sky performed the best but with tax and shipping it came to a hefty $200.00.I also purchased a 'Antenna's Direct' unit (Clearstream 4 at $249 bundle) which is much larger and heavier but not too large to be uncomfortable.All performed well.  The 'Antenna Direct' model exceeded the Mohu's in picking up a greater range.  I was able to pull in San Francisco from Sacramento, CA which is 100 miles away.  No Mohu or Winguard could do that.  Yet the ClearStream 4 suggested a range of 65-75 miles.But back to the MOHU SKY:PROS:*Lightweight; far too easy to install*Well-builtCONS:*30 foot coxial cable included was far too short from roof or attic to TV's.*Amp cable to power unit via USB or power cube also too short.  Limited and difficult access.*Price is excessive when considering materials are worth a fraction of that $180-$200 purchase.*Box shows a American Flag but never is there a place on box or unit that says Made In America.This is a excellent antenna for RV or boat users.  Yet it fails to deliver more than a few decent channels for home use.  Your choices are very limited.Again, my apology to all those that rate it as 5-Stars but the competition; especially the Costco Winguard is a great alternative at a fraction of the price.  The Antenna's Direct CLEARSTREAM 4 unit beat them all in range but not appearance or size.", "Set up in:  Fremont, CA.First off, I love my Mohu Leaf.  Love it!  It works fabulously and the only reason I would replace it is because I want more Leaf all over my house but don't want to have to buy a separate Leaf for every tv when I can set the Sky up and use the existing cables in the house.  That said, Mohu Sky is awesome.  It's like having the Leaf on my TV, but with slightly clearer and a few more channels.  The extra channels are nothing too spectacular (more infomercials, foreign language, and religious channels), but the improvement on the channels I had was great - ABC used to be a little spotty and grainy looking with the Leaf, but looks fantastic now!  My sister in law is in love with all the Chinese channels also (I never knew channel 26 had that many sub channels!).  With the Mohu Sky and a Roku set up, we definitely don't need cable in our house!If you have multiple televisions in the house and don't want to pay for cable anymore, this is a great antenna to have.  Highly recommended.", "\"After much searching, the best HD antenna I've found yet. My location: suburbs west of St. Louis, MO.Pros:* Looks nice in a kind of artsy and industrial sort of way* No need to directionally orient (but must mount it vertically)* Brings in more channels, makes existing channels more solid* USB powered pre-amplifier is very convenient* Small footprintCons:* You'll get more Home Shopping Network and Religious stations over the airBEFORE THIS ONE my favorite antenna was theWinegard FreeVision FV-30BB HDTV Antenna. The Mohu Sky HDTV antenna pretty much blew away my FreeVision. I compared the Mohu Sky with the FreeVision which I've merely got propped up behind my TV. I plugged in the Sky to the same coaxial cable I was already using and propped it up vertically in the same location. Running my TV's channel scan resulted in 25 channels, 6 more than I had previously. Surfing for about an hour I noticed a definite difference in robustness of signal with only one sporadically pixellated station (one of the new ones, presumably distant). Powering the pre-amplifier by using a USB port on my television was super convenient. I actually used a USB port labelled \"\"System Diagnostics Only\"\" with no problem.It looks like the pre-amplifier for this antenna is probably Mohu'sJolt HDTV Antenna Amplifier. I experimented a bit using the \"\"Jolt\"\" with my Freevision, and also with a spare rabbit ears antenna, and I was able to pull in a few extra channels that these antennas had not previously captured. The signals were also generally more robust. However, the best experience came with using the entire Sky HDTV system as designed: Antenna AND amplifier which resulted in the most channels and best reception.I've had miserable luck with antenna amplifiers which usually just amplify a bad signal, as well as amplify all sorts of existing noise resulting in no improvement whatsoever. For whatever reason, Mohu appears to be doing what most of us amateurs expect out of an antenna amplifier. It just works.I know that this is designed to be mounted in the attic, or outdoors at a height, but even without doing that I've found the Mohu Sky to be the real deal. Five out of five stars and one happy over the air TV viewer (HSN and religious channels and all). As with all technology, your mileage may vary due to circumstances beyond my control.UPDATE 26 APRIL 2013: I want to go on record promoting theWinegard HDTV AntennaI replaced - until I got the Mohu Sky it was better than any of my other antennas. I've hooked it up to another TV which just had a set of amplified rabbit ears (serviceable) and I'm getting excellent (not Mohu Sky excellent) reception. People have different budgets. If you can afford it, get the Mohu Sky. If you can't, consider the currently less expensive Winegard.\"", "This antenna is awesome!  It works wonderfully and it was able to pre-scan all the local stations (ABC, NBC, CBS, CW, FOX) in HD.  I will no longer pay money to the grubbing cable company!  I highly recommend this if you only watch basic stations and don't need the rest of those useless cable channels.", "The SkyHDTV antenna is a powerful, multidirectional antenna.  As someone that lives about 45-60 miles from most major HD broadcasters, I was hoping the Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna would live up to its promise.  I also live in a mountainous region.Installation was fairly simple.  If you have ever installed an antenna like this before you shouldn't have any problems.  It's also light, so mounting won't be a problem in most situations.  I chose to mount mine in the attic (two story home), mostly because it would give me a better angle over mountains and because I didn't really want it on the outside of the house.  While USB power is an option, I chose the power cube.  Obviously it tooks some time for adjustments and getting the best reception.Initially I hooked the connection directly up to a TV, but in the future I will feed it directly to the house's existing coax.  Reception is very crisp and clear.  The number of channels I was able to pick up has doubled, if not tripled.  Keep in mind that major obstructions will likely impact your results, so mounting it as high as possible will yield better reception.", "When hurricanes in the past have hit South Florida and the power was lost, I found myself with a television I could work off of a power generator, but with no access to satellite or cable reception.  I had been wanting to have an antenna to hook up to get over-the-air stations during these circumstances.  So, when a Vine opportunity came up with this Mohu Antenna, I decided to give it a try.  Note that I never had any intention to break away from my 120 cable stations or anything along those lines; I just wanted alternative access to the news and weather when the need arises.I must admit right off the bat that I didn't do anything fancy for mounting it.  I simply placed it behind a television cabinet (a tall, wardrobe style cabinet) and connected a coaxial cable from the TV to the antenna (see my uploaded photo).For my purposes, it worked perfectly for what I wanted.  I was able to receive three network stations in HD, two standard definition stations, plus (of no use to me) three Hispanic stations.  The stations come in clear with no issues.  A couple of other stations fade in and out or lock up, with the screen turning into mosaic pattens and then freezing up.Note that I tried facing the antenna in different directions to see if it made a difference, and in my case, it didn't.A few things to note about the antenna and the kit that comes with it:1.  The antenna itself is very light, and fairly small...about 22 inches across.2.  Because of its shape, you have various options to hang it or mount it, including simply driving in a couple of nails and hanging it off of those.3.  The instructions for mounting it are clear and well illustrated, and come in English and Spanish.4.  It also includes a power injector, which must be used if using an antenna splitter.I do recommend this antenna, because it gets the job done very well, it is compact, and it is easy to mount. I did knock one star off because it seems a little pricey at (as of this writing) $169.I hope this review helped...please feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions I might be able to answer.", "I previously have used theTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Receptionwith fair results. Some stations would come in great, a few were very particular about positioning of the unit, and others just never came in no matter what. After installing the Mohu Sky, I immediately noticed stronger reception of most channels. It was only after I repositioned the unit (rotated 90 degrees) that it really locked in on most stations in my area. The Sky is advertised as multi-directional, but apparently it does pay to position it properly.I have the unit mounted in the attic crawlspace of a 2 story structure. I'm just on the edge of a downtown area (Sacramento, CA) away from tall buildings, but near some medium to tall trees. With this unit, most all of my local stations come in with 100% signal strength and walking around under where the Sky is mounted does not cause any disturbance in the signal. As a matter of fact, some nights I can receive San Francisco Bay Area stations which are being broadcast 90 miles away (from Twin Peaks). This is not always the case, but it just shows the capability of this antenna under the right environmental conditions.I realize that reviewing a TV antenna is pretty subjective. Things like topography, trees, mounting location and even weather patterns can affect your reception. Some people may not get the results I got, but I think if you want to possibly greatly improve your TV reception I would enthusiastically recommend trying this antenna.", "\"As I was unpackingMohu Sky HDTV Antennafor review my daughter commented - Wow! It looks like a Klingon design from the Sci-Fi Series Star Trek. She is right. It does look like a Klingon Axe of some kind. With that family introduction out of the way let me share my experiences on testing the Mohu SKY HDTV antenna product.We have all been there, Most of us had subscribed to cableTV at one point or the other in life and some like me had even ventured with a clunky Satellite Dish in the efforts of getting better quality picture. CableTV has evolved and now certain places like here in the Silicon Valley Bay area you can get Hi-Def HDTV via your telephone line! AT&T; calls this U-Verse TV. But all that technology does not come cheap. CableTV providers do charge you arms and legs to give you basic cable and adds additional fees for HDTV and more if you want local channels etc.Getting clear \"\"over the air\"\" (OTA) free DTV / HDTV signals is always quite a challenge. In DTV there is no concept of \"\"Snow\"\" or images with ghosts. It is either there as crystal clear image with sound or blank screen. It is frustrating at times to deal with Digital DTV signals as they tend to vary in reception depending on time of day or how the weather or how windy it is outside even-though you might be using a indoor antenna. I personally over the years have tried so many different types of antennas. Some work quite good in UHF (Easy to receive) but very few are able to capture weak VHF (Hard to get) signals. After Analog to DTV cut-over some Local television stations opted to stick to their VHF frequencies (BTW, VHF frequencies have lower range of transmission) and those are the ones most of the current HDTV antennas fail to capture faithfully.The only good alternative is to have a roof top antenna preferably with a large 'dipole' with reflectors in the back and array of 'directors' in the front to capture these low frequency signals. But having such contraption generally means the UHF signals would get degraded or you have to point it to the TV tower by adjusting the antenna periodically for different stations. It is always difficult to design an antenna which performs well in all the VHF and UHF frequency range of spectrum. I did like the \"\"Silver Sensor\"\" Zenith(ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF) and it performed amicably well in UHF ranges indoors but had some issues with Multi-pathing (you can call it 'Ghosts' in the digital world) in the apartment where I lived before.I finally got lucky when I inherited myself a Quantum 1162A antenna when I bought a house which had this antenna installed by the previous owner and I was in heaven. No more signal dropouts. No more pixelations or loss of signal hands down the best if you do not mind having this huge antenna on your roof.Then came this tiny (when compared to the huge Quantum 1162A) Mohu SKY and as I tested it I find myself humbled by its performance. This thing rocks! This amplified High gain antenna has the full 'VHF' and 'UHF' frequency spectrum covered even in deep fringe reception locations. This antenna was able to capture all the channels my roof top mounted delivers that too by merely just by holding the antenna in my hands! - I am nearly 45+ miles from the nearest TV transmission tower (Sutro tower)This prompted me to install it on top of the roof alongside with my Quantum 1162A and test it further. After conducting some tests I see that I am getting similar or better signal gain performance when compared to my Quantum 1162A when checked side by side.Side note: Unlike what the manufacture claims, this antenna is somewhat 'directional' in fringe reception areas (Actually that is good in my opinion) you may have to point this antenna facing the towers for better signal strength. For extended tests, I left this Mohu SKY connected to my HTPC and ran some test OTA HDTV show recordings for past couple of days and I reviewed the recordings and did not find any loss of signals for the 72hour period. This tells me the Mohu Sky Antenna performs very well.The Build Quality and construction is top notch. The Antenna is completely weather proof. Lightweight and will not topple in high winds. All the needed hardware is included in the package and the instructions are well written. Just make sure that you install the antenna as high as you possible can on your house roof or attic and point it in the direction of the TV towers in your area and you will be good to go.Based on this experience I can safely recommend this Mohu SKY HDTV antenna to anyone who has plans to cut the cord from the greedy CableTV companies or merely to get stable 'high' quality free HDTV Local TV channels.Kudos! to the designers of this amazing product - Full five stars from me! -\"", "I've been on a monthly expenses reducing tear lately and laid my sights squarely on my cable company (AT&T; U-verse) recently when I purchased a Roku 3 and Western Digital Live TV Hub. Those devices are great for streaming media from content providers like Netflix, Amazon and more. The next step in my cable-elimination quest was to replace my basic cable, used to access local channels, with a HDTV antenna. I'd been reading a steady stream of reviews for a number of products sold here on Amazon when I was given the chance to try the Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna. I've been using the antenna successfully for approximately 1 month and now feel qualified to write a review.--------------------Setup:I decided to mount my antenna in my garage attic after contemplating a number of locations in my house including briefly considering mounting the antenna on my roof. My garage attic is easily accessible, there are plenty of mounting options (I chose one of the 2x4 beams), access to my already installed RG6 (copper coaxial cable) wiring, and a power outlet (ceiling mounted for the garage door opener). The Mohu comes with all of the mounting equipment in the box - the mounting plate, arm and bracket, and associated screws. Installation was incredibly easy and this coming from a novice DIY'er. The only area where I needed some assistance was tapping into my copper cabling. I had a friend assist me (with cabling tools he owned) with that and we were able to cut, splice, and split the cabling to accommodate my antennas signal.In my home I only have two HDTVs. One mounted in my living room above a fireplace and the other in my basement (home theater setup). Once I had the antenna powered on and the signal feeding into the house I was able easily get the antennas signal to both of my sets.--------------------Channels, quality, reception:I live in the Midwest in a fairly populous city and I'm pulling in approximately 25 over-the-air digital channels which in my opinion is absolutely fantastic. I used a site called Antenna Web to help determine where most of the broadcast towers in my area are and what kind of results I could expect based on my Zip Code and >30ft mounting height for the antenna. The channel quality in my area does vary from station to station as I imagine that it does for most. This year has been particularly lightning/thunderstorm heavy and my reception drops considerably during these periods. Other than the occasional drops, some stuttering and pixelation I'm very satisfied.--------------------What I like about the Mohu Sky Antenna:(+) Better than expected reception.(+) Easy installation even for a novice.(+) Everything you need is included in the box.(+) Multiple options for running power to the antenna.(+) Components are built well and overall good quality.--------------------What I don't like about the Mohu Sky Antenna:(-) If you're splicing into existing cable lines you'll need some experience and some cabling tools.(-) Prone to interference/outages based on atmospherics and weather.(-) Although not really an issue considering my install is in the garage attic, accessibility to power (for the amp) is a consideration when installing.--------------------What's in the box:1. HDTV antenna2. Mounting pole3. Mounting bracket4. Antenna bracket5. 30-ft of coaxial cable6. Amplifier/splitter7. AC/USB power adapter8. Associated hardware--------------------Closing comments:I'm very satisfied with the Mohu. This little antenna has allowed me to finally eradicate my cable company (from television at least) and paired with my other streaming devices I have a huge variety of content available at my fingertips. If you're looking for similar results I would recommend this antenna.", "I bought the leaf antenna also for a single tv. This one is for the main one in the living room. After having to move it around a bit we settled on a place. It brings in a lot of channels but for us there is interference when the thunder storms kick up. We are outside Atlanta and most channels that we are interested in come in fine the majority of the time so were happy. I also got Roku boxes to supplement the antenna. You have to give up some things with an antenna verses cable but if you can do it, this is the way to go. I like having the extra savings of not having to fork money over to the cable company, especially for channels that I don't watch. But between the antenna and Roku I have well over the channels I had with cable and have saved enough to upgrade the internet connection, and buy Netflix and Hulu Plus and still have money to save. That works!!!", "Purchased a Refurbished unit. It pulled in less stations than the old rabbit ear antenna. It was definitely a unit that had been returned before and probably is defective since I received the same number of stations even after I disconnedted the antenna from the 30' long coax cable...the antenna appeared to be doing nothing. Yes, the lines were hooked-up as per the included drawings and the USB power was showing a green light. Returned it and am waiting for my refund.", "QUICK TAKE:  The Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna is a fairly small and stylish antenna, and includes most of what you need to install it.  The amplifier improves the signal somewhat in most locations.  But the key to HDTV satisfaction is to figure out how to install a big enough antenna, if that's possible.  If this works in your location, and the style and features appeal to you, it's a solid and somewhat unique option.FIRST, DO YOUR RESEARCH: It's essential to do some research before buying.  Enter your address in at antennaweb dot org for information on (1) the strength and direction of TV signals in your areas and (2) suggestions of the right antenna for your location.  Needs vary widely, depending on the channels in your area and your location.  Find out what you need before buying.BE SKEPTICAL OF REVIEWS OF HDTV ANTENNAS:  For many people, the simplest antenna - or even a coat hanger - will bring in spectacular HDTV for some stations.  They rave about the antenna, when really what they should be impressed with is HDTV broadcasting technology.  So pay more attention to those who seem to have some experience with other antennas.  Ignore reviews from people who just got their first HDTV antenna.AN ATTRACTIVE ANTENNA THAT'S EASY TO INSTALL:  The antenna is the most important part of the system.  This antenna is large enough to pick up a good signal for many locations, and includes the hardware needed for most installs.THE AMPLIFIER ADDS A LITTLE OOMPH:  The Jolt Amplifier is attractive and well designed.  It's convenient for me that it includes an option to power the amplifier using a USB port, as I have a port on my TV.  It does improve the signal somewhat, and reduces the number of disruptions in the signal.However, it doesn't make a dramatic difference for us.  We get good reception most of the time.  We're about 10-12 miles from the antennas, with a direct line of sight, so pretty well located.  We still lose signal at times during snow or rain storms.SIGNAL IS BETTER THAN AMPLIFICATION:  While Mohu says the amplifier has some special tweaks, in general you're better off getting a decent signal in the first place, rather than trying to amplify a signal that's too weak.  That means a suitable antenna and a location that allows it to work.FIRMLY INSTALL YOUR ANTENNA:  Vibration, rocking or other movement is the enemy of a good HDTV signal, so try to install your antenna as firmly as possible.", "Bought direct based on reviews and their web site, which said we would receive 40+ channels in my area. Our existing wall-hung antenna could only pick up 15. Turned out, this one was only able to get 13, plus two really snowy ones that no one would watch. A phone call to their customer service line confirmed that 15 was the best we could hope for. Since we live at the top of a hill, with few obstructions,  I think their web site's numbers were bogus for our ZIP code.", "I cut the cable a few years ago and have used a Terk indoor HDTV antenna. I was very happy with the reception, although I had to reposition it when I wanted to change from CBS to NBC. That was annoying.I was very excited to receive the SKY HDTV antenna from Mohu. I was initially concerned about the installation, since it involved more than just sitting it behind the TV. However, it was much easier to install than we anticipated We chose the attic installation instead of climbing a ladder to install it outside. It took a little time, but was not difficult. Once it was installed and we hooked it up to the TV, it was easy to scan the TV for channels and use it.The antenna picked up all the major networks and a few odd channels I've never even heard of. It all came in AS CLEAR AS CABLE! The reception is amazing! Best of all, it truly is a multi-directional antenna and I can switch between channels without having to adjust the antenna. I'm impressed and very happy with it.", "However, when it comes to antennas, size really does matter.  My goal was to put an antenna in my attic safe from the Florida weather and racoons.  Yes, I had a raccoon climbing my antenna pole and getting into my attic from the roof(ugh!).  I am pretty far from tv stations so I ended up sending this antenna back and getting a channel master 4228 antenna with a cm7777 booster.  The latter proved much more powerful and I get a ton of stations including all the main broadcasters.  In a few months when my satellite contract ends this setup will be my big money saving free tv."], "Gamma": [0.03247122839093208, 0.03247122839093208, 0.0324472039937973, 0.03247122839093208,
