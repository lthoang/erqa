I gave it an complete initial charging, as recommended, and then gave it a test run.  I am impressed by both the volume and sound response of this unit - the bass response is surprisingly good for a unit this size.It has enough volume to easily fill a room.This external speaker would be good for a picnic, beach party, or other outdoor or away from home outing where you wanted to share music.  This external speaker has an iPod/iPad dock.  It also has an auxiliary jack on the back of the unit.  It accepts a 3.5mm jack (the size of most headphones these days).  If you have a cord with 3.5mm jacks at each end you could attach this iHome speaker to a computer or anything else via its headphone port.When the speaker will charge an iPod or iPad, but only when it is plugged into an electrical outlet.All in all, this is a great little unit.  Very cool.OK, now for a few downsides of this unit.1) There is a foot that extends out of the back of the body that supports it in an upright position.  When this piece is extended, a backstop/support for an iPod or iPad extends up out of the back of the speaker just behind the iPod/iPad jack on the top of the unit.  The instructions warn the user that the speaker could be damaged severely if you try to use the speaker without the back piece extended and iPod/iPad piece extended.  Why is this a problem?  Let's face it...lots of people these days never crack open a user's manual, especially with a unit like this one that should be easy to figure out without one.  If this is as big a deal as iHome makes it out to be, there should be a removable warning label on the top that the user would see right away.2) The manual further warns that the unit should not be pushed backward while an iPod or iPad is attached to the top jack, since this could \"\"severely damage\"\" the speaker.  Well, there is no latch or locking mechanism, or even snap-in-place feature that keeps the back leg in place until you want to retract it.  Again, if these is such a big deal the manufacturer should have built in some kind of locking or snapping mechanism to minimize the chances of this happening.  (Note: I incidentally moved the speaker and the back leg readily closed, partially - so it would be all to easy to have it close in connection with an accidental bump, etc.)3) A remote does not come with this unit, but there is a flier inviting the buyer to purchase one for $20.  I would have loved to have a remote with this unit, but not for $20.  Maybe iHome should have bumped the price up $10 and included a remote (IMO).The speaker quality, sound, and performance is worth 5 stars, but the relatively minor design issues and lack of remote lose one star.All in all, a great little unit.  I'm happy to have it!\"", "These are fantastic speakers. Very lightweight and extremely portable. The sound quality is clear but not the best, but the volume is great for a set of speakers this size. The material itself seems a little cheap. Love that you can plug in an iPad in.The battery charge last a long time, which is fantastic. Overall, a great product.", "I've been looking for a speaker system for a couple different purposes from taking my music outside to playing owl calls to survey owls in my area.  This device is great at both.  The speaker easily fills a room with nice crisp sound, and works as well as any dock I have used my iP0d on.DesignFor me the biggest feature of this device is the internal Lithium rechargeable battery.  I love the idea of not having to track down batteries and the convenience of just charging the speaker before heading out.  I can't say that I have exhausted the battery yet, although I have probably only used it about an hour of play time over a few hours.  I can say the battery covers my needs.  The shape is unique, and the fold out stand and iPod support combo is interesting.  I do wish there was a little more support or protection for the iPod and I can see why they list warnings for iPad users.  There is just a limited support for devices plugged into the 30 pin jack.The materials seem decent.  There volume buttons feel a little plasticy, but seem solid enough to hold up.  There is a band of chromed material on the edges that show fingerprints very well.  But for the price, this seems to be a pretty solid device.One thing I am very happy with is the charging button which shows clearly if the device is charging.  And even better, it tells the level of the charge so you can tell if it is nearly empty or nearly fully charged. I wish more devices did that.SoundI won't pretend to be a huge audiophile, but I do know that I like the sound this box.  I have been using it, wired to an outlet, in my bedroom and it richly fills the room.  The treble is crisp and the bass is not overwhelming - which is good for me. I have a Phillips and a Bose system and this hangs right with them for sound.PriceThe price is decent and i think you get more than you pay for in this instance.  They do cut a few corners by selling the remote separately (19.99 coupon deal included in the box.)Pros+ Great Sound+ Reasonable Price+ Internal Rechargeable batteryCons- Shows finger prints well- the iPod seems pretty vulnerable when plugged in - iPad more so- for older 30 pin ipods and iPads onlySummaryI don't know if I could be happier with the performance.  I like the price point of just under $100, you get great sound for the price.  I wish the iPod was a little more protected when plugged in, but I have not see any perfect way to plug one into a DOC.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this speaker.", "\"This iHome iD48 portable speaker system for iPad, iPhone, and iPods sounds exceptionally good! To be honest, it's the best sounding portable speaker system I have heard for Apple products... especially factoring in the size of the unit.  I love that it has a built-in rechargable lithium-ion battery which makes this thing a truly \"\"portable\"\" speaker. The sound is very well balanced and crisp... with good dynamic sound production throughout the full spectrum of sound.  I didn't notice any distortion either, even with the sound turned all the way up.  Not only does this thing sound amazing... the full volume that it can deliver the goods is very impressive too.  It's loud enough to fill up a medium sized room with no problems and with no distortion.  I also like the fact that it has an auxilary audio in jack/port so that you can play music from other sources... any source that comes out of a headphone jack.  The speakers also look like they are built good and sturdy, and I like the fold out stand design as well.Although the sound that emanates from these speakers are stellar, there are still some things about this speaker system that could be improved upon.  One main complaint I have is that it didn't come with a remote control... but instead came with a mail-in form to buy an optional remote for it. I don't know what genius came up with that idea, but it sucks.  If you are selling a premium speaker system that is mean't to be \"\"portable\"\" and the speaker costs a good chunk of change... throw in the remote for FREE! I mean, the remote probably only costs the company $5 to make.  For me, it sort of ruined the image of the company for me.  Talk about huge marketing blunders.  So... if you are \"\"iHome\"\" and you're reading this, take note: Next time, throw in the remote for free and even better yet... create a little tray (or nook on the unit) to store the tiny remote in the unit!  Presto!One other option that I wish this speaker system included is the ability to skip songs with built-in physical buttons on the speakers.  As it is, there are no such buttons. The unit itself is just a speaker and a dock for your apple 30-pin product of choice (iPad, Iphone, or Ipod).  You'd think that since they didn't include a remote, they'd at least put in some physical buttons... but nope, they screwed up there too. There are only physical buttons for volume up and down.  I'm starting to think there was some cost cutting involved in this speaker's creation. Thank goodness they didn't skimp when it came to designing the internal speakers themselves!Other thoughts:  It's nice that this unit charges your Apple product as it plays music. However, please note that it only charges your iPhone, iPad,  and iPod while it is plugged into the wall.  If you are running this unit from it's built-in battery, it will NOT charge your Apple product.  This is pretty understandable because you don't want the batteries on your speakers being drained by your Apple product when it's already using lots of power to deliver great sound.Conclusion:  This portable speaker system designed to work with Apple products sounds freaking amazing... it really does. As far as the quality of the sound is concerned, I think they hit this out of the park.  But the lack of a remote being included (even though they made one... but they just want you to pay extra for it instead of giving it to you), and the lack of physical navigation buttons shows that they could have made this speaker system even better, but chose not to.  That's why I took one star away from an otherwise 5-star product.Pros:-Exceptional Sound (and I rarely use the word 'exceptional' to describe anything these days'-Built-in lithium battery gives you a truly portable speaker... giving you the ability to walk around with this sitting on your shoulder, and looking cool while music is playing.  Yes, I was an 80's kid.-Looks to be built sturdy, with a cool fold out stand.-Audio-in Port lets you play music from a variety of sources... not just from Apple.-Charges your Apple stuff while it's playing music (if speaker unit is plugged into the wall)Cons:-Lack of a Remote, the remote is sold separately! This just means they made one but were greedy and didn't want to give it to you for free.-No physical buttons for play/skip forward/backward...etc. Only Volume buttons. This was probably to force you to buy the remote which they didn't include.-Only works with 30-pin Apple products... sorry iPhone 5, iPad 4 owners. I guess you could use the Audio in jack though... but no charging for you! ;)\"", "I've had speakers that are tinny, muddled, muted, bass-centric and static challenged.  And then I've had speakers that have great clarity but lack a full bodied sound with depth.  I've had speakers that have held a bigger sound, but have muddied the way it comes out.My music never sounded so good!  Everyone from James Taylor to Etta James sounds rich and full of sound.  Wonderful!It charges my devices as it plays.Sunday morning, cup of coffee and a little jazz filling the house.  This product does deliver!", "\"Having bought a couple of iHome products in recent years, I was happy to have the chance to try out their iD488BVC Portable Speaker System. I like the idea of an iPod/iPhone/iPad speaker dock that has a rechargeable battery, as you can take it outside or on short trips without needing a wall outlet. It comes with a wall adapter, of course, for indoor use (and when you want to charge your device as well as play it).This iHome unit delivers a really big sound, and while it's probably not at the same audio quality as the average Logitech setup, it gets the job done. This is for outdoor parties, not for audiophiles. The obvious down side to this unit is that it's geared towards older model Apple devices. If you have an iPhone 5 or a newer iPad, you can't dock your device, and may need an app just to use it. I have an iPhone 4, so for me this was straight up \"\"plug and play\"\" right out of the box. The lack of a remote was also a minor irritant, but I usually have this at arm's length when I use it, so it wasn't a huge issue.This speaker system does exactly what *I* needed it to do, hence the 4-star rating. But if your Apple device is newer than mine, it's probably not going to be very useful. Keep that in mind when deciding if this is the right product for you.\"", "This is one if the better sounds systems that iHome has put out.  It has great sound because it has both active and passive speakers (two of each).  The vast majority of speakers are passive.  A passive speaker doesn't have a built-in amplifier; it needs to be connected to your amplifier through normal speaker wire. This speaker level signal has been amplified enough to drive the speakers sufficiently. An active speaker, on the other hand, has a built-in amplifier and is fed by a low-level (line-level) signal passed along an interconnect cable originating at your preamplifier or controller; the amplifier is an active electronic device.  So you are covered in both cases.  The bass is passive and the treble/midrange are active speakers.The oval system has an easy fold-out stand in the back to allow the system to point the sound towards the listener instead of up.  The docking port is wide enough slot to use with any iPod, iPhone or iPad, EXCEPT iPhone 5. This is a major mistake for iPhone 5 users. I do not have an iPhone 5, but the instructions do NOT list iPhone 5 as compatible. If someone reads this and can verify that I am wrong, I'd appreciate it and so would readers.  This happens frequently and I have stated such in other reviews.Also if you have a protective case around your iPhone/device, you 'might' have to take it off as the 30-pin extension attachment is not vertically long enough. You can always buy aBluecell 2 pcs Black Dock Extender 30-Pin Converter for iPhone 4, iPod ,iPad 2, 3orYIKING  Dock Extender 30pin Extension Adapter Cable for Apple iPad 2/ iPad 3 iPhone 4 3G iPod -White, but you shouldn't have to. I don't know why iHome has not figured this out yet.  An OtterBox definitely won't fit.The lithium battery is the real star here, meaning no batteries to mess with and a constant supply of power.  There is a bright white power line on the top left that tells you exactly how much power you have left and how much you are using.  Of course, just plug it in for both sound and charging for your lithium battery and your iPhone/Device. There is also an auxiliary port in the back for using other devices.  Oh yeah - the look is sleek and cool.", "This is the nicest sounding portable speaker I have used for my iPod.  It has a 30-pin dock (so you will need to use an adapter to dock the newest iPods) but it holds the iPod securely.  I was a little disappointed that there was no remote control included but it can be purchased separately.I will definitely be using this when I travel this summer!", "This is the perfect speaker set for traveling. It's light and extremely compact while kicking out awesome sound. It's dual voltage, where if you've seen any of my other reviews is key for me as I travel internationally constantly. I ended up getting rid of my Bose MusicMonitor Speakers that were geared toward travel because it was just too inconvenient to constantly tie up the wires and keep everything together.With this speaker, I can just pack and go. This isn't as small as I'm used to, but I can still fit it in my carry on with a couple of outfits and toiletries. As far as sound, again, great sound for the price and the size. I'm talking nice bass, clear sound, full enough for me.  It would definitely be nice to have an included remote.  I've used speakers for years and most include it.  Not sure why this wouldn't.  Otherwise, five stars for this portable speaker.", "I use my iPad often and find that I am doing more and more with it.  I thought that a portable speaker like this could add to my enjoyment of my tablet. Here are the things I liked and the things I did not:Things that I like:*  Lightweight and easy to take on the go*  Good battery life*  Great sound quality*  Gets loud! Great for the backyard*  Good bass for it's sizeThings that I dislike:*  I have a 4th generation iPad with the Lightning connector and the iHome only has the 30-pin. This does not allow me to set my iPad on the stand as is intended which means I cannot charge it.  Although, it does have an aux connection in back to allow other devices to be used. It would be nice if the item came with a Lightning adapter seeing as though both the new iPad and iPhone  have changed to the Lightning connector.*  I wish that I could use it with my iPad in the horizontal position for movies and such.Also, it does not have Bluetooth (which would alleviate the need for an aux connection all together)Overall, I do like this sound dock and would recommend it to a friend."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0004980883095413446, 0.2905749976634979, 0.011094738729298115, 0.37374159693717957, 0.0046520656906068325, 0.0002539231500122696, 0.05890205502510071, 0.2455795854330063, 0.0005315828020684421, 0.014171331189572811]]}
