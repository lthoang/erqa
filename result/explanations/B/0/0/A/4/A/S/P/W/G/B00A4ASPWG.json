It was super easy - just add water, a tablespoon of butter, and pop it in a glass bowl in the microwave for 12 minutes.  I was able to time it to be ready the same time my oven main dish was ready, and both went onto the table hot and ready to serve.  The consensus from my family was that the rice is delicious!  I had hoped the Chipotle flavor would come with a little spicy hot as well but for those who don't like heat, this is perfect because there was non detectable.  As a quick and easy side dish, this can't be beat.", "We made one package of this and...meh.  Tasted like Mac and cheese with some extra spices and rice instead of macaroni.  Kids may like it, but why?  It isn't terribly healthy, so if I'm going to eat or serve pre-packaged convenience foods and risk all of the bad stuff, it better taste pretty darn good. This doesn't meet that standard.", "This is a quick and tasty side dish when the proper directions are followed:  1 3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup milk, a tablespoon of margarine and let boil.  The added rice doesn't take long to cook through.  Throw in some cooked chicken breast and this becomes one tasty meal.  The chipotle is noticeable but not overbearing.", "\"This Knorr \"\"Creamy Chipolte\"\" Rice Side is remarkably easy to make and tastes very good. We don't eat a lot of rice since two of us are diabetic but occasional it makes a nice treat.The Chipolte flavor well represented and there is a decent spicy heat on it, but far from overpowering. Most of my family likes some spiciness and this was fine for them. We made this as directed and found it be just a little watery, which was easy to correct.Overall, this is an easy way to add a good tasting fast side to your main dish.Recommended!CFH\"", "There was no doubt the crew all liked this rice-noodle side.  Even though it has flavor enhancers, I liked it a lot.  The chili pepper comes through nicely.I added spicy chorizo sausage, dandelion greens, carrots, chopped cilantro, lime and minced garlic to this side.  Probably this is a highly versatile side.  I recommend it.", "\"I love Knorr products.  I've used them for decades here in the U.S. and in Europe and I've always been satisfied with their quality.This instant rice product is a tasty dish, but my family all had the same response.  All five of us around the table said, \"\"It tastes good and it's spicy, but where's the Chipotle flavor?\"\"  Chipotle chiles have a very distinct smokey flavor.  That's what a chipotle chile is: a smoke dried jalapeno.  This rice has a pleasant mild spicy heat, but none of the trademark chipotle smokiness.The directions were simple and easy to follow.  My daughter made the rice in nine minutes.  That's a plus, because sometimes we're short on time and don't have a half hour to make real rice.All in all, I like this product.  If it were just called \"\"spicy rice\"\", then I'd have no qualms with it.  I was sorry it lacked the genuine chipotle flavor though.\"", "\"I didn't use the stovetop or microwave to prepare the \"\"Creamy Chipotle\"\" rice and pasta blend, but rather prepared it in myBlack & Decker 3-cup Rice Cooker.  Similar to the microwave method, I added 2 1/4 cups of water to the mix.  The mixture was close to the top of the pan, but came out perfectly.  I don't generally add anything to my rice except veggies so I can definitely taste the spice in this side.  I really wasn't enamored with this rice and pasta blend, but others do so I'll have to compromise on how I rate it.  This is just the type of side dish, as are all the Knorr sides, that you can add any number of things to.  I'm not much of a person for spicy hot things, but if you do you can add things such as jalapeno's or hot peppers to make a decent side dish.There really wasn't anything in the ingredients that my dietician would frown at, however it may contain egg and sulfites which may be problematic for some people.  For one thing there are no artificial colors in here.  The rice is colored by paprika and annatto.  The only thing that was slightly off was the high sodium content, but it wasn't quite as high as the Creole Garlic Butter.  If you are going low sodium, you may wish to take a pass on this one.  I do like Knorr products and have used many of them in the past, especially to liven up a main dish.  For many, this \"\"side\"\" could turn into one easily.  If you like \"\"spicy\"\" you'll probably love this one.  I didn't love it, but rather simply liked it.NUTRITION FACTS:Serving Size: 1/2 cup (64g) (1 cup prepared)Servings Per Container:  about 2.5(The following are for the prepared product)Calories: 230Total Fat: 1.5gSaturated fat:  0gTrans Fat:  0gCholesterol:  0mgSodium: 580mg (24%)Total Carbohydrate: 48g (16%)Dietary fiber:  2gSugars:  2gProtein: 6gINGREDIENTS:Enriched Parboiled Long Grain Rice [Rice, Niacin, Ferric Phosphate (Iron), Thiamin Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Folic Acid], Enriched Vermicelli [Wheat And Durum Flour, Niacin, Ferrous Sulfate (Iron), Thiamin Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Folic Acid], Whey (Milk), Parmesan, Romano And Cheddar Cheeses (Pasteurized Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Corn Starch, Salt, Tomato Powder, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Citrate, Maltodextrin, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Paprika And Annatto (For Color), Potassium Chloride, Chipotle Chili Pepper*, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Butter (Cream, Salt), Natural Flavor (Milk), Autolyzed Yeast Extract. *Dried.

Rice Sides has the rice included, its not just a flavoring packet.  The quantity is just about perfect as a side for 2-3 adults.  My wife and I both liked the flavor and quantity quite a bit, but I would caution against adding salt.  As is, this particular Rice Sides is juuuuuuust on the edge of becoming too salty.  People with a more sensitive palate might find it a bit too far on the salty side.  The chipotle adds a slight spice, not overwhelming and very pleasant.Overall, a very fast, easy item to cook up and add to your plate alongside a main dish.", "\"This Creamy Chipoltle has some good qualities and, perhaps, some not-so-good qualities. Here is my assessment:Pro:-When cooked properly, the rice has to a tender texture.-There is a mild, lingering, pleasant \"\"heat.\"\" (Not spiciness but \"\"heat\"\").-A fast side-dish. (It takes about ten minutes from start to finish).-Inexpensive.Con:-Flavorless.I added a bit of freshly grated parmesan to mine and it helped.

My kids would eat it I hid some veggies in it and served it with chicken and it was not bad. It was also very quick to make I had dinner on the table in less then 30.", "with a south of the border flavor. What I especially like about this rice is that the spices are mixed with the rice initially. You don't need to open a packet, mix the contents into the rice and get a sort of grainy, semi-blended result. Also the chipotle flavor is delicious, not too strong and not too weak. The amount of rice is ample as well (one cup prepared). It can be cooked stove-top or in the microwave.The sodium is a bit high at 580 mg; the fat content, however, is low (1.5 gr).I am impressed enough with this rice that I shall be looking for it on my supermarket shelf, and will also be trying more of Knorr Rice Sides.", "Knorr Rice Sides Menu Flavors Creamy Chipolte is one of many others offered that makes a quick go to for a side or a full meal! My family thought this particular flavor was decent. The kids weren't big fans but sometimes it's really hard to get them to try most foods. It's not really spicy at all, decently flavorful and quite creamy. It made for a tasty side to our dinner! My husband not a huge fan of pasta or rice said wasn't bad at all!Preparing the side on the stove top ( you can do it in the microwave too) was super simple and took just about 10 minutes, maybe little less to finish cooking! The simple instructions ensure that anyone can throw a great meal together in no time at all.The package can be made as is but there's also a recipe on the back to cook up an entire meal for four people by adding some meat and a few vegetables. It's a tasty rice pasta blend and I'd recommend it definitely as a quick side or for a main course!", "I recall a few years ago people complaining about the overuse of chipotle in our society, and I think this may be an example.  While this is a very easy-to-prepare dish where one simply just dumps it all in water and sets it to boil, the taste is only so-so, reminiscent of a dish from a fast food restaurant.  Not a taste I'll be remember very long.", "This is a spicy rice, that you will either love or hate. It is basically chipotle ( roasted jalapenos) and rice.  Might be good in a britto under beans or meat, but we did not like it on the side.", "I love the taste of the Knorr Rice Sides Creamy Chipotle. Just the right amount of tomato taste and chipotle seasoning. It cooked up fast and easy. This is a perfect side for a busy family cooking up a large dinner. Takes very little work to complete. I really enjoy the taste. Great product!!", "There is almost nothing that Grandma likes to do better at this time of year than head out to the lake to go camping!  We've had the opportunity to try several of these new Knorr Rice Sides lately, turning one into a casserole from pantry staples and serving another straight up.  ThisKnorr Rice Sides, Creamy Chipotlemade a great quick, one-pot camp dish, easy on space and weight.How To - Saut&eacute; about 1/3-`1/2 pound hamburg (you could substitute diced kielbasa, chorizo, andouille or a 12 ounce can of boneless chicken) with 1 small diced onion and about a half of a pepper (I used a California long green frying pepper, turning orange), diced fairly small in a tablespoon or so of oil in your cast iron skillet.  When the onion has become translucent add the contents of the package and 2 cups of liquid.  (Water is fine but you could also use stock or an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and a can of water.)  Stir, bring to a boil, cover and move to a cooler area of the fire (or reduce the burner) to cook a further 20 minutes or so. Serves 2-3.The product contains no artificial flavors or colors, but do note that this is a rice & pasta dish, so it is not gluten free.  It is rich in thiamin (20% RDA) and folic acid (20%), as well a fair amount of dietary fiber (8%). Sodium content is 24% RDAGrandma's $0.02 - Like the other flavors that Grandma has tried, thisKnorr Rice Sides, Creamy Chipotleis a handy pantry staple, great for a quick casserole, a pick-up dinner or a wilderness meal.  It sure would be nice if the folks at Knorr put these up in a multipack of assorted flavors though.Recommended", "I am not a big fan of spicy food but I thought this might not be as spicy as advertised.  I was right.  It has a pleasant, almost sweet taste and it's super easy to make.  The instructions call for a quarter cup of milk, of water, and a tablespoon of either margarine or butter (I used the latter).I just put it in the pot, put in some vegetables for good measure, brought to a boil and served with chicken.  It made for a very quick and easy to make side dish.Having said that, I am sure this isn't something you should eat every day but when you come home from a long day at work and about the last thing in the world you want to do is cook a proper meal, this will make for a satisfying side dish.  And at $1.70 per pack the price is pretty reasonable too.", "I am more of a make my own rice sort of person, but in a pinch these packaged sides can be helpful. This tasted good, but was too salty for me.", "I have a love/hate relationship with Knorr Sides, some are good, some are dreadful (the Lo Mein comes to mind)I actually liked the Chipotle one that I am reviewing here today.It was easy to prepare, I always like that, since I'm kind of a klutz around the kitchen.I actally added some hot sauceSmoky Iguana Chipotle Hot Sauceto jazz up the flavor (I love things spicy!)recommended!", "\"No, it's not a gourmet meal, but for pouch food, it's a big step up from some of what I've had. It's a bit spicy (if it wasn't, it wouldn't be chipotle), and it tastes just fine. Cooking directions worked just fine. Not sure I would have called it \"\"creamy\"\". You add a half cup milk, but by the time it's done cooking there's not much sign of it, and calling it creamy is a stretch. Still... it's fairly good. And at current prices here (note the 20 percent off coupon if you click the right place), it's about what you'd find it for in a store (a little over a buck a pouch), which is pretty good for Amazon, which often prices these types of products higher. Anyway, a decent product, at a decent price.\"", "I prepared this packet for dinner tonight. I mixed in a fried egg and had a large meal for one.  By itself it probably wouldn't have done for two, not by itself, but I wouldn't've needed to add too much more.  For four this packet might make a decent side dish.The point is, there's enough in the packet to allow you to play with portions.It's a breeze to cook, took me just over ten minutes from start to finish, and that's including time to fry the egg.  It would have been very easy to clean up after had I not allowed the sauce pan of milk and water to boil over.  Mea culpa.  The instructions called for a quarter cup of milk and 1 3/4 cups of water, plus a tablespoon of margarine; I added a little more milk and a little less water to make the thing a little thicker.  Even then it was a hair on the soupy side.  If I make it again I may add a little less liquid altogether.Taste, of course, is the main concern.  It tastes pretty good; nothing to write home about, but as I said in the title, satisfying.  The chipotle has quite a kick; after a few bites I decided to add a dash of sugar to cut the spiciness a bit, and I do believe that improved things considerably.  Unless you really love spiciness, even more than me--and I do enjoy my spices--you might consider doing the same.This was a quick to make and, with a little egg or chicken or whatever added in, can provide a very satisfying dinner.  Definitely consider keeping a few packets in stock for nights when you want to eat well without expending any real effort on preparing something.", "Tried this just by itself and it was fantastic! I'll be buying more of it and will try adding chicken to it to see how it works! :)", "\"I tried out this new Knorr Creamy Chipotle rice side when I made fajitas for some friends this past weekend. The consistency and texture are what I have come to expect from Knorr, and it has a pretty sizable kick, even when I added the optional tablespoon of margarine (Country Crock worked particularly well).That being said, I wasn't particularly crazy about it, and my two friends (much pickier than I am, by the way) called it \"\"weird\"\" and \"\"meh,\"\" respectively. I don't think this is a bad rice side myself, but for just a little bit more cost I'll stick with the boxed Goya rice, which has a more widely-appealing taste and more rice per package.\"", "This rice side was easy to cook, just throw everything in the pot, bring to a boil, then simmer for 7 minutes.  It has a smooth, creamy taste, with a medium amount of spiciness.  My wife found it too spicy, but she is often over-sensitive to such things.  It's flavorful without going overboard.  I will definitely be getting it again.", "A long time user of Knorr Sides, I've been pretty excited to sample some of the new flavors available in both their pasta and rice options.  Some have been good, some not so memorable.  Knorr Rice Sides are something that we prepare frequently at our home. If you want fancy cuisine, these will not fill your needs. But for the most part, these sides are quick (less than ten minutes), inexpensive (approximately a dollar each) and tasty additions when you need to add a starch to fill out your meal. They are a convenience, plain and simple. Can you find better quality alternatives? Sure. But Knorr captures a certain market and I love them for that! We have sampled just about every Knorr product known to man, we are a faithful customer.One thing I have noticed, though, following the exact instructions can sometimes lead to extra liquid remaining in the finished product.  It's not so noticeable in the rice dishes, but the pastas are pretty inconsistent.  So I do play around a bit with proportions.I had a chance to try three new flavors from the Knorr Rice Sides selection and while none blew me away as the next must-have flavor sensation, they fit comfortably into the Knorr family.Creamy Chipotle (4 stars):  This one just sounded tasty, but I certainly wouldn't gush over the creaminess factor.  The tomato chipotle sauce is surprisingly effective, and I like an option that can be paired with Mexican food aside from the usual boring choices.  I would certainly put this in my rotation to keep on hand.Thai Curry (3 1/2 Stars):  I was wary of the Thai Curry brand because I didn't think that Knorr would really capture such a specific flavor profile.  Did they?  Not particularly.  This has a mild spice, at best, but still succeeds by being pretty tasty.  It's not authentic by any stretch but I would definitely buy it again to accompany Asian influenced dishes.Creole Garlic Butter (3 Stars):  Of the three flavors, this was the one that I was most excited about.  Garlic, Cajun spices, ham, what's not to love?  In truth, though, this was one of the blander and less distinct entries to my estimation.  I didn't hate it, but nor would I seek it out for a specific purchase.  KGHarris, 8/13.", "I found this rice side pretty tasty for a quick and easy rice side dish. The chipotle flavor has a nice kick but is not overly hot. In short, if you want something to cook stovetop in 7 minutes (after the water boils), this is a decent zesty choice.  In general, I'm not a big fan of fast cooking rice dishes because the rice and vermicelli mix used in many of them is just okay tasting and the texture falls short of a good rice dish. But this is a pretty good casserole type dish.  Of note, the sodium may be an issue for those who need to restrict their intake (580mg per serving).  Oh, and you need milk on hand for stove top preperation.", "This packet produces a spicy rice side dish.  The pros are definitely that it's fast.  It cooks in about seven minutes, all you have to do is add some water and milk.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  It's spicy, but there's not much else to it.  It tastes like spice and salt have replaced an actual, defined flavor.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.", "Me, to my 7-year-old:  try a small taste, it might be too spicy.Him: It's just right!Him: More!&lt;He cleans his plate>Him: Dad, can I have more rice?That rarely happens!Anyway, the chipotle flavor is just right - enough to be tasty, with a hint of spicy kick, but still creamy, smooth, and delicious!", "Knorr Rice Sides Creamy Chipotle flavor is actually rice and pasta with a cheesy sauce with a pronounced flavor of smoked peppers.  The flavor is good but not at all spicy and it needs some hot sauce to give  it a bit more kick.  Otherwise, it's a nice starchy dish.I think hikers will like it because it's cheesy enough that it can be made without the milk and butter, substituting olive oil and water or even just water and still have it taste good and have a nice texture.  Directions call for it to simmer for seven minutes after being brought to a boil and then left to mature for a couple of minutes and the rice and pasta definitely need some time to soak up the moisture and soften up.", "I have been pretty happy with this line of products - they are easy to make in little time, and you don't have to add many other ingredients (and those that you do have to add are pretty basic).  They are a little high in calories, so I wouldn't use them on a regular basis, but I can always use having something in my pantry that's a good emergency addition to an incomplete dinner.  The taste wasn't too strong (I would have actually preferred it a bit spicier, but I understand that's not for everyone), but it was good.", "I really hooked on the Knorr Rice Sides. These are great tasting. They are full of flavor and easy to make. This is as simple as boiling the water. Everything you need is in the package. I followed the directions on the package and in a few minutes you have some great tasting rice. no more boring rice with Knorrs . Every one in my family really enjoyed it and it was not overally salty at all. The Chipotle is not overpowering it is just a hint that you know that its there.", "Knorr products are very inexpensive, which makes it easy to try out many flavors.  Creamy Chipotle is pretty good.  As with other rice and pasta mixes, the texture is pleasant and preparation is simple.  The flavor is a bit spicy, with a light artificial smoke background.  I do wonder if the amount of artificial ingredients and preservatives are necessary to keep the price down.  Not only do they hurt the flavor, but they leave me feeling bloated and gross after eating them.  I am not an all-natural person, but sometimes eating Knorr products feels akin to eating a scented candle -- it smells like food, but my brain is telling me that it is not edible."], "Gamma": [0.4786819815635681, 0.5213180184364319], "Beta": [[0.03208925202488899, 0.03713821619749069, 0.023127688094973564, 0.03127811849117279, 0.03290095552802086, 0.03328853100538254, 0.02682419866323471, 0.031378038227558136, 0.030649980530142784, 0.032407425343990326, 0.03242092952132225, 0.030780315399169922, 0.032221924513578415, 0.03334779292345047, 0.033433109521865845, 0.02681516855955124, 0.031313229352235794, 0.03313703089952469, 0.03247511014342308, 0.030405664816498756, 0.029534704983234406, 0.0284627266228199, 0.030588310211896896, 0.03135276585817337, 0.03020942211151123, 0.028404761105775833, 0.03394705057144165, 0.03482953831553459, 0.026833539828658104, 0.0328129380941391, 0.036444421857595444, 0.029147164896130562], [0.03217654675245285, 0.036832500249147415, 0.02754921466112137, 0.03133102133870125, 0.032966624945402145, 0.03352803736925125, 0.026665544137358665, 0.031657807528972626, 0.030242865905165672, 0.032759469002485275, 0.03227432444691658, 0.030514460057020187, 0.0324641577899456, 0.033531393855810165, 0.03304997831583023, 0.022805387154221535, 0.03131883963942528, 0.032901864498853683, 0.03243086114525795, 0.030717527493834496, 0.02955451048910618, 0.028831934556365013, 0.02986893802881241, 0.03155966103076935, 0.03107399120926857, 0.028122534975409508, 0.032061222940683365, 0.03471328690648079, 0.027251437306404114, 0.03295915573835373, 0.03623577207326889, 0.030049119144678116]]}
