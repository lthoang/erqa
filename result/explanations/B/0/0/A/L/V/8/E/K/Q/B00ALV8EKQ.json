"], "reviews": ["Just like with the Nexxus hydralight conditioner I tried, this was so lightweight it felt like nothing almost in my hair.  I have fine thick hair and don't want anything that is going to weigh it down or add oil to it.  But this is almost beyond lightweight.  It might have smoothed my hair a bit, but the tangles were still there, and the roughness.  It softened my hair slightly, but my hair is very soft to begin with.  I look for body, shine and detangling from a conditioner and this didn't give me those things.My hair tends to frizziness in our high humidity and this did help a bit with that.  But there are other conditioners I like more, that add shine.  This is so light I can't use it on a permanent basis.EDIT: I realized that this adds body and fullness to my hair.The color is more vibrant, and it smells good too.  This doesn't smooth or eliminate frizz, but it does make my hair more alive.", "The Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-in Conditioning Foam truly lives up to its name! This is my first Nexxus product, and I love it! The product is definitely weightless, and it's also super moisturizing. In addition to being weightless and moisturizing, it detangled my hair. I washed my hair in the shower and sprayed it on, and the comb glided through my hair. This leave-in is one of my new staples!", "As described on the bottle and product description, this leave-in conditioner is intended for people that want to add volume. It adds 85% more volume without weighing hair down. My hair has a Keratin straighter in it, which means it is naturally curly but chemically straighten and has about 95% of the curl removed. Occasionally I want to add some volume and height to my hair for certain styles and thought Nexxus Hydralight would be the answer, sadly it left my hair a greasy mess. If you have tried foam-in hair colors and you know how it leaves your hair looking like straw? Well imagine greasy looking straw, that is what my hair looked like. Hey but it smells great!Maybe it is just my hair type. I have dry coarse hair. Maybe this is more suitable for thin normal hair. Is it intended as a styling product? Too many variables and questions - this is not for me.", "This leave in conditioner can be used on dry or damp hair.  The pump works well and the foam is white with a light, fruity, fragrance. When distributed evenly through hair, it promises to impart contol and shine without weighing hair down.I found this product more effective on dry hair than damp. The recommended half pump did smooth and soften my hair. I can't say I noticed any additional shine but it did tame unruly fly aways. It did not weigh down my fine hair and it was not greasy. I keep this at the office where the recirculated dry air seems to suck the life out of my fine hair. Could you achieve the same results with less expensive products or even a dollop of hand lotion? Of course but the container is small enough to tuck in a drawer, doesn't clog and smells nice. It is a small indulgence in the war against  those bad hair moments.", "\"Typically I think of Nexxus as having high quality, albeit it often expensive, products.  This \"\"leave in\"\" conditioner is a small bottle, just 5.5 ounces in the container, but it costs about $13.  At that price, I would expect superior performance.  However, this conditioner is average, at best.The ingredients are: water (Aqua), Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-4, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-11, Fragrance (Parfum), DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Propylene Glycol, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Sea Salt, Red 33, and Blue #1.The directions say for damp hair, apply 1 to 2 pumps to your palm, rub hands together and evenly distribute through hair.  You may also apply it to dry hair, using just half a pump.I tried it both ways, and used half of what was suggested.  I still found that it made my hair a little greasy.  My hair is light, and fine, so I also had other members of the household try it, and they felt the same way, even though they had thicker and drier hair naturally.For me, this product was very average and just not worth the high price.\"", "The Nexxus hydralight leave in foam wasn't super foamy, but it stayed in my hand and smoothed into my hair fine. My hair tends to be super dry and get fuzzy and the Nexxus felt nice, didn't make my hair look heavy or greasy at all. I didn't have that crunchy feel of product in my hair. My hair felt soft and the dry fuzzy ends do seem calmer and less fuzzy and fly away.The scent is very light and pleasant.", "At first I wasn't too impressed with this product but ultimately I was happy. It did seem to lower the amount of frizz and make my hair look better. It wasn't a wonderful product but definitely not bad. I would definitely use it again. It didn't feel like there was product in there but made it look nicer. It stayed nice for a few days, too.", "I have fine dyed hair, cut in layers to my shoulder. Every winter I have to deal with looking like I stuck my finger in a socket - my hair is flying off in all directions as soon as I take off a scarf, hat, or sweater.During the work week, I wash my hair and then use a styling mousse and dry my hair. I used this product when my hair was wet (and then used the styling mousse) and also after I had styled my hair (when it was dry). While you can use this product on wet or dry hair, I had the most success with my hair when I used it on my dry hair - after I had style it. I also used it on the weekends (when I don't use any styling products in my hair). Again, I had the most success when I used it on my dry hair - my hair for the most part stayed under control.The directions say to use 1/2 pump on dry hair and I found that wasn't enough to control my hair (I needed a full pump). Also, you do need to be careful - if you use too much your hair does look weighed down.It does have a scent when you first use it, but the scent disappears once to apply it to your hair.Overall, this works great.", "This leave in conditioner is just okay.  It is lightweight and absorbs into the hair quickly.  The scent is very light.  But for me it does not make my hair as soft and manageable as Nexxus Humectress.  This may work for some.  But for a deep conditioning lotion I recommend Humectress.", "\"This is an interesting product. I very much liked the fresh scent, and using it as a foam was very different from my creamy leave-in products. Nexxus makes good quality products too. Yet, I beg to differ with it being described as \"\"moisturizing\"\". It has a bit of \"\"hydrogenated\"\" castor & coconut oil in it, but it did not moisturize my hair at all. That being said, I used it like a mousse, more like a styling product & was satisfied with the result. On one half of my hair I used only this product, and on the other half I used a leave in conditioner (creamy type) with this product on top. I liked the result of the two together rather than this product alone. Since my hair is wavy, I used it to \"\"scrunch\"\" wave into my wet hair. That worked nicely, my hair dried more like a sort of \"\"corkscrew\"\" style wave. I think this product would work much better on fine (thinner) hair rather than my type of texture. My hair & scalp is dry, hair density is medium to thick, and long (to my waist). It tends to frizz in humid weather. This product did NOT prevent frizz when the weather changed. In sunny/dry weather it was fine. For what it's worth...it worked fine once I used it as a mousse. Shake the bottle before pumping...it will foam better & you'll need less product. 4 stars.\"", "This is foam leave-in conditioner has a nice, light, pleasant scent. You apply this conditioner to damp hair and then style as usual. It is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down at all, which is good, but it made my hair dry.On the other hand, you can also use this on dry hair to control fly-away hairs and static. That worked for me, but overall, this is not a great product for my hair. (I have dry, curly, color-treated hair)", "Used as a leave on conditioner immediately after shampooing on damp hair leaves my hair feeling soft and natural. I experienced no greasiness. I'm an ash blonde and some conditioners leave my hair looking dark and greasy. This doesn't. It is simple to use. Just use one or two pumps, distribute to hair, and style.The added benefit offered by this product is you can also use this on dry hair. It's a fantastic styling aid. Due to the dry winter air I've been dealing with plenty of static electricity when I come back to the midwest. My Bride of Frankenstein look goes bye bye with a half a pump of this dandy stuff. Very convenient and non-sticky, this is a great and light conditioner/styling aid.", "I condition my hair 2-3 times more often than I was it to keep it from drying out.  So on the days that I do wash it I usually start my hair product routine out by applying a leave-in conditioner.  Some that I have used in the past are heavier creams and lotions that I have to use sparingly or else they will weigh my hair down.  With theNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foamit is so lightweight that I have no worry about how much I use.  It goes through my hair easily, allows me to comb it out without tangles and there is very little scent which is something that I like. While the bottle does look small the amount needed is very minimal, so I would expect it to last a long time unless you are using it daily. For me the main purpose of keeping my hair moisturized is to lessen the frizzies and this is a product that definitely helps.", "I've been using the Nexxus Hydralight shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioning foam. It has a nice pleasant scent that lingers on your hair.The conditioning foam is different than other products that I've used before. Normally, leave-in products are watery or a serum, this is like a mousse. It smelled and felt nice on my hair.After using the line, my hair feels soft and is tangle free. After blow drying, my hair is soft, smells good and full of body but a little frizzy and not at all what I would call sleek.This is the second Nexxus line that I've used and while they are fine, they are just average. I've used drugstore brands that work just as well if not better for a quarter of the price.", "This is a lovely smelling product and I used it as directed.  It  is an extremely light/weightless product and one that does NOT weigh your hair down, or leave it greasy looking.But then again it really doesn't seem to moisturize my hair either.  I have badly damaged hair,and I thought that using this after my regular conditioner would give me that little extra 'boost' by hair needs.My hair  doesn't seem any softer, silkier or smoother than when I use a simple inexpensive store brand.", "My daughter and I tested this product several times as we both have extremely dry hair and scalp. It leaves hair feeling soft and easy to manage. In addition, we like the light fresh scent it has. This product I would indeed purchase in the future. Satisfied and Recommended!", "I have long (really long) fine hair. It is naturally a frizz ball but I have it straightened professionally with a keratin product. Although I am Caucasian wrap my hair at night. I learned how on YouTube. It is a genius thing to do. You wake up with silky straight hair, there are no tangles and you avoid tons of damage.Of course my tips dry out. So the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam is fantastic for rubbing through the ends of my hair before combing it into the wrap. It brushes out smoothly and is not sticky or filmy. I also seems not to promote tangles as some leave ins do.", "The #2 Stars are because it did absolutely nothing on my 4a-4b Natural hair however due to the lightness and foaminess of this product I believe it would work just lovely on Natural hair that has been straightened for a week or on relaxed & Caucasian hair.", "I've used tons of different conditioners over the years. I am addicted to the hair-care aisle of every drug and discount store out there. However, I can't recall using a Nexxus product before, and I must say I am very well satisfied. Now, to be honest, most cnditioners out there will do your hair some good. You can spend a little or you can spend a lot, but no matter what the price you want good results. When a conditioner is bad, you know it right away because it may look OK at first, but the next day (or even that very night) your hair gets that heavy, hanging in chunks greasy look. This is especially true with leave-in conditioners, which I adore using.Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditoner Foam was true to it's name -- it is light and airy right out of the package. It starts out feeling like a mousse, but does not impart any stiffness. After applying it through my hair, my hands were not sticky or greasy -- a good indication of the results to come. A little goes a long way! The product made it easy to get a wide-tooth comb through my hair, and that is quite an accomplishment. The end result was a blow-out that was smooth with lots of bounce. My hair didn't look limp from over-conditioning, and it certainly looked improved!I used it again a couple of days later, this time letting it dry naturally so that I could wear it up in a pony tail with curls around my face. My hair still had shine and manageability, and my curls dried looking soft, nicely defined but not stiff in any way.I would definitely recommend this product to friends, and I will certainly be purchasing it again!", "\"Yes, this costs less than the other product I've used for \"\"winter\"\" hair that is either flat or flyaway, but theNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, 5.5 Ounceisn't a product I'll run out to purchase.  The principle is good, bottle is attractive, foam dispenses as desired, is sweet but not offensive or long lasting, but it does add a greasy appearance to fine hair when used as a final conditioner on damp hair.  Using a tiny bit as a controller of sorts, it works, but not better than other products that are less costly.  I was hoping my daughter would use this product on her thicker, longer hair, but she can't stand the scent.\"", "\"Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, 5.5 OunceMy hair is almost to my waist, and in excellent condition -- so I'm very careful about the products I trust it to, if ya know what I mean.reads label:  \"\"is a daily leave-in treatment that provides weightless nourishment to restore softness and shine.

Just press pump and grab a bit of foam -- don't need a lot -- rub hands together and stroke through hair.  Ahhhhh!No sticky or tacky residual feeling on hands or hair. At this rate, one 5.5 ounce bottle is sure to last a long time.Either using on freshly shampooed damp hair before blow drying, and then using hot irons -- curling irons -- after blow drying), or freshly blow dried hair (to weightlessly control fly-aways and static -- followed up by hot irons, or left as it was) -- the results, for Me, were basically the same.  Shiny, beautiful, hair that felt like pure Silk.  I kid ya not!  Did not weigh the hair down!  It also seemed to tone down the brassiness of my blonde hair.My new best friend, to be sure!  Off to buy more Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam before it's all gone --- or My Sisters hear about it and hoard it all. :)Does the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013note:  Other Nexxus products I've reviewed:Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture ShampooNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture ConditionerNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam\"", "\"Age: 55Hair length: around collar boneHair type: very baby fine, and not thick, also highlightedI love this, Nexxus Hydralight. I will most certainly be purchasing this product (and checking out the others in its line) when I use all of this.I've tried it three ways: First, on wet hair that I didn't blow dry. I just finger-combed it as it dried, and it left my hair soft without fly-aways as it dried. Then I tried it on dry hair to control dry-air fly-aways, and it worked great - at first it goes on \"\"wet looking\"\" but after it dried, I brushed it out and it made my hair pretty and shiny. The third time I used it on less wet (a bit more than damp) hair and blew it dry and this is the result I was happiest with of the three. My hair dried out smooth and shiny - I am prone to having smooth and shiny hair anyway, because of how fine it is, but, there was a noticeable difference in softness, shine, and smoothness.I don't notice a fragrance as I do with some of my other products I use, so if you don't want your hair to have much scent, this is a good product for that, too (though I don't mind a nice fresh scent in my hair, so this isn't an issue either way.)I don't put any near my roots, as I am not sure if it would make it \"\"oily\"\" or whatever later on, but I don't notice any weighted down feeling or oiliness in the rest of my hair.This is winter-time, so I'll be curious how it works in the summer - I live in the mountains, so humidity won't be much of an issue, still, am curious.All you need is a few pumps, rub your palms together, and distribute. No tacky sticky feeling, either.I'll buy this product.\"", "I do love Nexxus products, even while they are moderately pricey, they always seem worth it once you begin to use it. I have always been a huge fan of their Therappe shampoo for years--so luxurious!This extra light foam conditioner for damp hair is fabulous! I have light strawberry blonde hair, so anything that is greasy feeling or heavy make my hair look dirty and dark. The conditioner itself is NOT sticky to the touch or feel either, it rinses right off your hands quite easily. This treatment doesn't have that effect at all. It leaves my hair much softer and shinier after blow drying.I really like the way this makes my hair feel. Plus, I don't even use it every time I blow dry, it seems to condition my hair for a day or two (I still use in shower conditioner, as well.). Additionally, like ALL Nexxus products, this stuff smells great!I highly recommend this product.", "I have fine hair, so many conditioners are too heavy for me. I've always liked using spray-type leave-in detanglers. This one seems to weigh my hair down more than my favorite sprays. Before giving up on it, I'm going to keep using less and less till I get it right and I'll limit it to the ends of my hair, away from my scalp. I really like the fragrance.", "I liked this product because the light weight moisturizer was easy to distribute and didn't leave my hair greasy, sticky or crunchy.  Instead, my hair was soft and manageable.  This even helped manage frizz!I always keep some kind of leave-in hair treatment on my shelves because I never know when my hair is going to need a little extra TLC.  So many things effect your hair on a daily basis, sun, wind, water (hard water, salt water, chlorinated pool water), you need a spot treatment to give it a little moisture and this product fits the bill nicely.", "I have thin hair- I need to use a leave in conditioner with detangler- This is a nice moisturizer but doesn't help detangle my hair. It isn't listed as a detangler though as I still gave four stars. My hair feels very soft after, but wish it has some more product to help detangle out of the shower. I wash my hair every other day and it feels very soft and nice after the second day.", "\"I have fine, thick hair (my strands are very fine but there are a LOT of them). My hair tends to be on the dry side, prone to frizz, and is easily weighed down by heavy products. The idea of a \"\"weightless moisture\"\" product line sounded right up my alley and I was really excited to try it!I used this product along with theNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture ShampooandNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner. I found this line to be really nice - it's more reminiscent of the quality one could expect from Nexxus back when it was a salon-only brand.This leave-in conditioning foam is really a neat product. It pumps out looking much like foaming hand soap and acts a lot like mousse when applying it to my hair but it doesn't leave my hands or hair sticky. After drying my hair I find it to be soft and weightless as expected - not \"\"hard\"\" or \"\"crunchy\"\" as would be the case with a mousse product.It's amazing what a difference the right product line can make and this is definitely a great line for my hair type. Excellent product!\"", "\"Recommend!  As Goldilocks would say, this product is \"\"just right\"\" for hair that loves moisture but weighs down easily.My hair is more or less perfectly programmed to drive me nuts.  :)  Hairstylist's tend to like my hair texture more than I do (maybe they are just good actors, lol).  I have medium/long (just above my bra strap) brown hair.  In terms of number of strands, it's thick, but the strands are fine.  It's somewhere between curly and wavy in shape; to loose to be \"\"truly curly,\"\" too tight to be \"\"just wavy.\"\"  Basically, it's born for unruliness.  Heavy product kills my curl/wave, yet even then it's a bear to straighten.  And I have to have good conditioners to keep the frizz and tangles at bay.My curls/waves need conditioner, but heavy product weighs them down.  I actually curl best with minimal product because of the weight issue.  So, THIS conditioner was practically MADE for me!  I snagged it for free via the ever-lovable Amazon Vine, but I will DEFINATELY be purchasing more.  It's so lovely and light-weight.  Yet, very, very moist.  Left my hair SHINY and frizz free!I washed and conditioned as usual (with Joico KPak, which I ALWAYS go back to and highly recommend).  Applied this conditioner and a bit of mousse (mostly roots), and allowed to air dry overnight (I avoid the hair-dryer unless I'm straightening).  The next morning I was delighted with my shiny spring-y curl.  Totally light-weight!FEEL: In the hand it feels very moist, light a moisturizing foam, just short of oily.  Very rich feel.SMELL: Pretty, light but almost edible perfumed smell. Not overwhelming or chemically, but there is a definate smell to this product.\"", "I used and liked both the shampoo and conditioner in this same Nexxus weightless product line. The conditioner is the first one that truly doesn't weigh down my thin textured, long hair. Because I was pleased with the other items I'd tried in the product line, I hoped the leave-in conditioner would also be terrific. It wasn't.The instructions state to use the product on damp hair, after first shampooing and conditioning. Direction details are half a pump to use as a way to manage flyaway's and frizz, and two pumps as a leave in conditioner. I first tried half a pump and blew dry my hair. That quantity didn't weigh down my hair but also didn't do a great job controlling frizz. The small quantity of Bio-Sil that I previously used for that task works far better.Next I tried two pumps as a leave in conditioner and found my hair was weighed down - felt heavy and looked flat. Given the thin texture of my hair I decided that perhaps two pumps worked for thick textured hair, and perhaps by reducing the quantity I'd be happy with the results. So, next I used a little more than one pump and even that seemed to be too much. At that point, I lost patience trying to figure out the right quantity -- something that should be stone cold simple. I don't have time to waste toying with the product -- so, I am underwhelmed  and disappointed.The shampoo and rinse-out conditioner are definitely products I will continue to use, but this leave-in conditioner fell short.", "Nexxus Hydralight is a liquid that comes out like a mouse from a pump (non-aerosol). It instantly made my daughters hair feel thicker. I put it on her hair after her bath, rubbed it in a brushed it. Then, in the morning, when her hair is normally very knotted, brushing her hair was much easier. It was still a little knotted, but not as much. She loves the scent, as it has a very nice, clean fragrance. I think this is her new favorite....and mine, too, if it makes brushing her hair easier! While this seems expensive, well, it is....but as long as it works, I don't mind, especially because you don't need much at all. A little is all you need. My daughter has very long hair, and I used a little more than a quarter sized dollop. I am very comfortable recommending it.", "I have not been a fan of leave in condition because I hate how it dries up and leaves your hair feeling stiff. Well no more.
