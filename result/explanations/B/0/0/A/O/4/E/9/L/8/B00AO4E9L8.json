I can't tell you how many women in the local wally-world were checking me out. I turned around at the dollar store and nearly tripped over a lady who was standing so close to me in the checkout line.  I thought my wife was going to ravish me before I got it out of the Amazon box.  Women become helpless putty in your hands when wearing this stuff.  Well, not really, but the rest of what I said is mostly true.  I just have no idea if has anything to do with the product or my confidence.  Seriously, the product does smell nice.  I first felt a little like I was \"\"bathing in cologne,\"\" but the masculine scent fades enough so that it is not overpowering once you get out of the shower.  I like it, but probably need to go to some higher class joints to see if this product that is marketed as an aphrodisiac in a bottle really is effective at snagging the ladies. :)\"", "I order this for my pre-teen and he loves it. It gives a good lather, leaves him and the bathroom smelling refreshingly clean and male, without being overpowering.  We've definitely added to the list of must-haves.", "\"I've tried many Axe products from hair gel and body spray to shampoo, and have yet to be disappointed. Axe Apollo Shower Gel is no exception.As the product description states, it has a fresh, clean masculine scent. It is a \"\"scent,\"\" which means it's noticeable, but not overwhelming. I did feel refreshed when stepping out of the shower which is not always the case with other body washes. It makes you feel clean rather than just wet. I don't know if I smell like an \"\"irresistible hero\"\" now, but there's only so much you can expect from any product. Axe delivers.\"", "I'm a shower gel nut. I love trying new ones. This was the first time I tried an Axe product and wow, it's nice. It lathers up very nice, rich suds and has a very nice clean scent that does linger even after the shower. When I worked out later in the day and was sweating, I even smelled Axe then. This is very, very nice.", "\"Its hard to go wrong with Axe and this is another great smell. I know these are made for me but I buy them not just for my sone but for myself. I find their performance to be far superior to that of the products for woman and the smells are very appealling. \"\"Apollo\"\" is no different. it will be a regular on my shower shelf.\"", "Axe is the name of choice for all the sports dudes in this house.  And, this Apollo is the preferred scent by all of them.  After trying all of Axe's scents, this one is the most preferred with Dark Temptation running a close second. It is, by far, the only thing I've ever found that can truly eliminate all of the sweat, dirt and odors that sports elicit, as well as the workouts in the basement.  Yeah, you're going to attract a few girls using this too - it has a very manly, piney, woodsy scent and the boys in this house truly enjoy the smell.  They also use it with the deodorant and the body spray.  It isn't overpowering either - it dissipates within about 30 minutes out of the shower.  However, it doesn't dry out their skin with using it twice daily, and it just plain works.Hope this product is around forever - the boys just love it and actually fight over it when it gets down to the small amounts remaining in the bottles.  The BEST way to use this product - either get one of Axe's sponges they sell or a cheapie at you local grocery store for a buck.  You only need about a dab the size of a nickel to get up a gob of lather and it makes it last longer.  Believe me, with tons of boys running around you need to find ways to stretch the budget!  That's the usage that is recommended by Axe anyway and well, it just works.  HIGHLY recommend!", "\"As the product description states, it has a fresh, clean masculine scent. It is a \"\"scent,\"\" which means it's noticeable, but not overwhelming. My grandson did feel refreshed when stepping out of the shower which is not always the case with other body washes. It makes you feel clean and that is the ultimate goal. I don't know if he felt that he  smelled like an \"\"irresistible hero\"\"  but there's only so much you can expect from any product. Axe delivers as far as he is concerned.\"", "My teenage son loves the Apollo fragrance by AXE. He has very sensitive skin on his face, so he has to be careful what he uses on his face, but the shower gel is a different story. He loves the way it has a full lather, without needing to use a whole lot. What he likes most about it, is the fragrance this shower gel has, he says that it leaves a clean feeling, but the fact that the fragrance is a little strong, it lasts for a while after he gets out of the shower. The Apollo fragrance is his favorite.", "Like every Axe product for men I have experienced - and how many products that involve self-care for men are actually out there? - this one is exactly what I have come to expect: well-performing, a tad overly-fragranced, and definitely reasonably priced. Ideal for an evening in an Eastern-European nightclub!", "The man of the house is a fan of Axe and typically buys the Dark Temptation line from Axe for shower gel and spray deodorant.  Since he's been loyal to that line for a while, I wasn't sure if he would like the Apollo scent as much.  The first time he used it, he emerged from the shower like a little kid on Christmas day.  The scent lasted after rinsing and we both agree it's a pleasant citrusy type of fragrance.  He really likes the shower gel overall in terms of how it cleans and the level of moisturizing, but especially for the characteristic fresh citrusy scent of this new Apollo line from Axe.  He wants to try out the other Apollo products from the brand.", "Regardless of the heavy marketing regarding Axe products, and the warnings regarding some of them, I found the Axe Shower Gel Apollo, 16 Ounce, very efficient at what it claimed to be able to do, which is help you wash well. I will not deny that I had taken some kind of a dislike because of the heavy advertisement tactics, but at the end my curiosity got the best of me. The gel comes out thick and I believe it is best when used with a proper shower towel, cloth, or even the the japanese salux, which allows for a lot of cleaning foam to build and this way one uses less.The shower gel definitely gets the job done, and I found that one container lasted an above average of time, making a pretty good value for the hard earned dollar. I did not notice any strong smell during or after, like some of these shower products have a lingering scent. Some you like a lot, some you do not as much. I found this product kind of neutral in the smell department, with maybe a vague pine fragrance? As to the lather this product produces, there is no doubt that using it, like I mentioned, with the salux nylon japanese bath towel I am able to produce plenty of lather, enough to do the whole body with just an average amount. The few time I tried it directly into my hands, the gel came out thick and if one is not paying attention, it might just slide out of the hand onto the shower floor. Using it this way, I can see where a lot of it would be wasted.Leaves you feeling clean, and ready to face the day with optimism. Not being in the demographics age to which Axe caters, I found myself a little bit of an intruder. Without expecting much in the way of female passerby's jumping on my path out of the blue, and once I put aside the generation gap that exists, I found that in the shower this gel works for whoever uses it. Would I become an Axe shower gel user when there are countless other brands to consider? Probably not. I figure is kind of like spring break being for the crowd that enjoys it. For its cleaning properties I give it a sincere 4 Stars. Amazon, once again, gets my heartfelt thanks for letting me try this product and get very clean in the process.", "\"This product review of the Axe Shower Gel Apollo, 16 ounce is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about \"\"new and pre-released items.\"\" We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.The New Axe Apollo Shower Gel comes in a neatly designed dispensing container that is easy to use. The fresh, clean liquid provides a rather sensational shower for as you wash... the scented aroma therapy takes place and we can relax... breathe deeply and enjoy the experience.The scent is masculine, so I tried it but asked my brother to use as well and the sage with crisp mandarin with smooth sandalwood satisfied him because he says when he arrived at work many commented on the clean scent experienced.Highly recommend this product, makes a great gift for the men in our lives.\"", "i get really dirty at work.  so i need a good soap product that gets the grit/grime/grease and dirt off of me.  i squirted some gel on the scrungy and went to town on me body.  this stuff did a good job of getting the dirt/grime/grease and grit off of me.  it left my skin clean feeling and the stuff doesn't smell half bad.  i used just a little squirt and it took care of all de body parts.  since i shave me head and face the gel lathers up really good so i get a clean shave from the razor.", "\"The new AXE Apollo Revitalizing Shower Gel has a good clean fragrance, has plenty of sudsing action, and does seem to have a \"\"revitalizing\"\" effect (a sort of menthol feel on the skin). The aqua colored gel is thinner than some body washes I've used. This is a good feature because it comes out of the 16oz container easily but is not runny. The spout on the top opens and closes easily with one finger. The hourglass shape of the container is ribbed at the waist making it easy to hold in the shower. One of the best features is that, although the gel has good sudsing action, it rinses off cleanly. I don't like the itchy residue that is left on the skin by many other brands of gel. The picture story on the black container is humorous, showing \"\"unlimited female attention\"\" if you use the AXE Apollo gel. Great product.\"", "This Axe body wash is not just for teenage boys, contrary to popular belief. It smells great, fresh and clean. It lathers fully with a loofah and does a great job cleaning. HIghly recommended.", "As with almost all Axe products, I think this Apollo scent is nauseatingly strong but my teeneager likes it.  I also think it's way overpriced for a shower gel, but once again, my teenager is happy enough to spend his money on it!  So the bottom line is 4 stars from the teenager, the product user!", "Axe's latest scent,Apollois probably one of their best scents ever. It is much more pleasant than some of the other axe scents I've used in the past.As for the body wash its self,  like all the other Axe body washes, you can expect a great body wash that lathers, well and gets you, as OutKast put it, SO Fresh So Clean.Excllent body wash", "quick and easy showering with this shower gel.  Just use a bath sponge and pour a small amount onto the sponge.  Laters up easily and will last for one bathing episode.highly recommended- will buy this product again.", "As a soap or body wash, this product covers the basics.  Put it on a sponge or scrunchy and it will clean your body.  As far as its lathering, I did not think it was great.  I put a lot on the sponge and it did not cover my six foot four inch body.  I had to add more to get completely cleaned.  As far as the scent of this product, it is the same artificial scent that I have found in all Axe products.  It definitely does not fit the Mandarin and sandalwood flavored description that I read prior to ordering this product.  It does smell flavorful.  Many people would enjoy this sweet smell.  I do not because it is too artificial smelling for me.", "\"This stuff smells great and lasts for quite a while throughout the day. Not to mention my wife really thought it smelled \"\"sexy\"\". I would give it five stars except for the trashy advertising on the back of the bottle! Come on people, I have young boys in my home that I don't want reading about how this product will get you sex!\"", "\"I can't complain about the Axe Apollo shower gel. It's got a nice, manly smell, and my wife seems to like it. I wouldn't go so far as to say I've got women flocking to me as the ads for Axe always portray, but it does the job. I feel clean in the morning and smell nice. What more can you ask of for a shower gel? Price-wise, it's a little more on the pricer end compared to the usual Suave brand I use, but it's really not bad if you compare it to other \"\"high-end\"\" shower gels (if I can even say that).\"", "Apollo Axe Shower Gel has a nice clean crisp scent.  The notes of citrus and basil linger quite a while, but yet the scent is not as overpowering as some other Axe products.  For guys who like to smell good, but not be drowned in a super strong scent, this Apollo Axe is for you!", "\"Axe Shower Gel ApolloThis is a 16 oz/473 ml sturdy plastic container of body wash for men, which I obtained for my son.  It is a blue gel that lathers nicely and has a seductive odor that it leaves with the user - not perfumy, not overpowering.  (I know this because I rubbed some on my hand, lathered it up, and rinsed it off.)  For those who like Axe products, the body wash has one of those Axe \"\"manly\"\" scents.The container uses \"\"ultra lather\"\" and \"\"seductive fragrance\"\" terminology.  Thumbs up for the creative advertising that shows a guy pix next to a girl pix.  The girl appears to be wrapped in a towel.  The caption reads \"\"The cleaner you are, the dirtier you get\"\" :).In case you are skin sensitive, the label indicates sodium laureth and a bunch of chemical names I do not recognize.That said, I agree that the scent is seductive.  I believe the container would travel well in your luggage, but I suggest double plastic bagging any liquids just in case.  Airlines are brutal with luggage.  (I think they have an elephant step on luggage just for spite.)\"", "\"Not sure I would go so far as to say this product makes you \"\"shower like a hero,\"\" as touted in the advertisement campaign, but this shower gel provides a good alternative to using a bar of soap in the shower.  Benefits include: a pleasing, manly scent (pine trees come to mind) that lingers a while after you shower; less mess on your shower shelf than you get from a gooey bar of soap; and an easy lathering texture when applied to your skin.  This is a product I could see myself buying when the Vine container runs out.  In fact, I'm starting to develop a brand loyalty to Axe, in part because I'm a sucker for their edgy packaging and slick commercials but also because they provide a solid line products.\"", "This is a really fresh-smelling, great lathering body wash. It rinses clean and leaves your skin feeling terrific. The scent doesn't linger overly long, which may be good or bad depending on whether or not you want to smell like a clean person or like a body wash. Love it.", "My husband is always using my shower gels and this was the perfect opportunity to get him something designed for a guy.So far he has used it every morning for the past 10 days and says that not only does he like the smell (I don't - too sweet), but also doesn't have to use very much of it to get a decent lather.  And if he chooses to buy some in the future, I checked the price and it is extremely reasonable.So, I would definitely call this a success.", "This shower gel combines mandarin, sandalwood, and sage to produce an intoxicating, masculine, yet subtle fragrance. The bathroom still smells amazing long after the shower is complete and it leaves just the right amount of fragrance on the skin, so you don't smell like you just crawled out of a cologne bottle. The only complaint I have is how much gel it takes to produce a good lather. I had to use twice the amount to get the same quality of lather of the shower gel I normally buy. This may or may not be important to you. I think the fragrance is worth it.", "I like the fact that I don't have to use a lot of it to get a good lather. That feature means it lasts longer. The smell is pleasant though I have yet to be attacked by a hoard of women. There have been two or three but not a hoard.I really like that the soap comes of of the bottom of the bottle. That's a nice feature when you begin to get to the end of the soap.I'll get it again.", "\"\"\"Axe Shower Gel Apollo\"\" has a good-smelling scent that stays with you for a while after you get out of the shower.

The bottle is easy to grip and the Apollo scent is nice. We haven't really bought any Axe products we didn't like.Recommendation: yes, two thumbs up for Axe shower gel.", "Unilever claims on the package that this product should produce superior lather, but I didn't notice any difference from any other shower gel I've used (Dove Men Care, Nivea, etc).  The other alleged selling point is the scent which is supposed to drive women wild with sexual desire.  (Anyone familiar with commercials for the Axe brand will recognize that this is the general selling point of Axe products.)  I cannot speak to whether women generally are attracted to the scents used in Axe products, but making such a claim about a shower gel seems particularly silly.  Yes, the product does have that typical, slightly medicinal Axe smell when you put it on, but after it's rinsed off it doesn't leave behind that scent (thankfully!).So, if you need a shower gel and this is fairly priced, I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this product.  There's nothing special about it, however.", "I'm a long time Axe user. It's good to have the new Apollo line out to change up the normal scents.
