"], "reviews": ["\"I have been using Perfective Ceuticals eye therapy cream for three weeks to improve the appearnace of my skin under the eyes. Overall, I like it. I see some improvement, although it is only a relative improvement not total obliteration of the fine lines and wrinkles.I am attaching a photo of the cream in my hand (photo can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo). The cream is white and totally unscented. The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much. Direction say to use just a small drop under each eye, twice a day. The second photo show a container next to a pen for size reference. With the cap off the container is 3.75\"\" tall from the bottom to the top of the pump.The cream spreads nicely, leaves no shine so I can put it on and go out without worrying about tell-tell shine under my eyes. I am applying the cream twice a day in the morning and in the evening. It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics.I received this cream for testing and evaluation from the manufacture. Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the \"\"growth\"\" factor mentioned in the name. I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.I received an explanation that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a protein with 53 amino acids. It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically. It is approved for cosmetic use by the FDA and there is no evidence topically applied EGF causes skin cancer cells to multiply faster.EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines. Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area. Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide) helps under eye wrinkles and crow's feet wrinkles to become more resilient to the aging process. The cream also contains Retinol and Ginseng Extract to de-saturate dark circles.Complete list of ingredients:Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, EthylparabenIn response to my inquiry the manufacture also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (\"\"Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging\"\" Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H. Gold, Mitchel P. Goldman, Julie Biron) which describes the results of placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of skin cream containing EFG.Note: I checked that you can find this article by Googling for its name if you want to read the entire study.In this study the skin was analyzed clinically and with with imaging hardware. This study found that skin surface roughness decreased between 10% and 18% after 2 months of twice-daily application of the cream. I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect. It works, but do not expect miracles.Ali Julia review\"", "The Perfective Ceuticals eye cream is one of the best I've ever tried. It soothes under my eyes reducing puffiness and within 4 weeks I could see a reduction in all the lines under my eyes and the crows feet at the corners. Even more impressive is that I first began using this during allergy season, when my eyes are swollen, aching messes. I had no discomfort, even when I used the cream while wearing contacts. I noticed a reduction in puffiness in about a week, the crows feet and lines noticeably diminished in four weeks.Highly recommendedsample provided", "I am of a certain age and have wrinkles around my eyes.  I tried the Perfective Ceuticals eye cream and was amazed at how my wrinkles seemed to disappear, the skin around my eyes appeared brighter, and the lines under my eyes were no longer present.  The skin felt more resilient and younger to the touch.  This is a wonderful eye cream and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It will most likely prevent aging as well as it hides aging.  It is a cream for everyone.", "\"If you are looking for a product to take twenty years off of your skin, you will probably end up disappointed by anything you try.  This product does not make me look like I'm twenty (I'm 50), but when I use it in the morning the skin around my eyes feel soft and hydrated and the crepe-paper texture that my eyelids take on when they're not hydrated goes away completely.  And the best part is that at the end of the day my skin feels almost as good as it did in the morning when I applied it.  This is my definition of success!I have used many different products over the years, from drugstore brands to the highest-end of department store brands to spa brands and this brand is every bit as good as any of the more expensive products I've used.  It's not the cheapest skin care product on Amazon, but there is such a huge difference between this and the lower-priced products.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\"\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire\"", "The claim: PC has Epidermal Growth Factor that helps diminish the length and depth of fine line and under eye wrinkles and crows feet.  The Matrixyl helps reduce eye puffiness.Does it work? OHMYGOD! Yes!!  I've been using Perfective Ceuticals for 2 weeks. I am more than in love!!  I love how the PC absorbs quickly doesn't leave a greasy film. I noticed a difference in the firmness around my eyes within 2 days.  I noticed the bags under my eyes were firmer and the line under the bags are less defined. The crows feet lines are definitely softer. But I'm most thrilled with the bags being diminished!! I truly believe PC will make my eyes look even better with continued use. [...] to see my full review.", "I have been using this anti-aging eye cream for two weeks, and already I consider it a miracle.  I suffer from eczema around my eyes, particularly under the eyebrows and on my upper eyelids, due to some unknown allergen.  Cosmetics, even hypoallergenic types, can trigger or aggravate my condition.  The skin on my eyelids often feels extremely fragile, as though it will rip if I rub it.  So . . . when I received this small pump bottle, I fully intended to use it under my eyes only because of my lid sensitivity; however, after having no reactions under the eye, I decided to give it a try.  This is the FIRST product out of about 20 that not only doesn't provoke irritation but actually improved the skin.  In the two weeks since I started this, I have had no outbreaks.  The skin on my lids feels almost normal again.  It looks healthy and less tired.  Hooray!  It didn't cure my eczema, naturally, but it made the skin less irritated and more resistant to outbreaks.The cream comes in a small pump container, and one push dispenses enough to cover the area around both eyes.  As with other Perfective Ceuticals products, it contains epidermal growth factor (EFG) that is supposed to increase skin replenishment and restore some collagen and elasticity.  From two weeks of use, I'd say that this does indeed improve the look of my eyes, with one exception, noted below.Ironically, the one issue I've had has been under my eyes, and it appeared only after 10 or so days of use.  Now when I wake up in the morning, the area under my eyes is slightly puffy.  I'm considering using this only on my lids or only during the day.  The skin itself looks much better, though, so the puffiness might be due to something else.  (Note:  The manufacturer sent a sample for review.)Update:  After many weeks, I'm still using this eye cream with excellent results.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Well I'm impressed. This is by no means a face-lift in a bottle, but after using this product along with Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor, and Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor I have noticed a difference in my 56 yer old skin.The lines and puffiness in the skin around my eyes have lost some of their harshness after less than 3 weeks of using twice a day. My under eye area looks a little more youthful.I come from the generation that thought is was wonderful to sun outside at the beach all day using baby oil with iodine in it to deepen your tan and now my skin is paying the price. I have looked long and hard for something that will help just a little and I really think that this trio of products fits the bill.The Anti-Aging eye cream is quickly absorbed and leaves your eye area feeling smooth all day, while also giving you a lovely canvas for your other cosmetics. Just the tiniest bit is enough to cover your whole face and neck.Let me repeat ---> you will not see a huge difference in the deepest wrinkles (at least I didn't) but you will see a softening of those lines that powder and eye-shadow can get trapped in. I presume that with longer use I will see a bit more improvement to my face and that's all anyone can ask for.", "\"I did hit the gene pool  jackpot in a couple of  ways.  I got my mother's hair, still nearly as thick, almost as shiny and exactly the same color as it was the day I turned 16 - no gray to be seen.  (My sisters, both younger, both gray for a decade, are livid.)  I also got my Dad's good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  Still, I have my share of lines, a couple of scars and the beginnings of a few crows's feet around my eyes.  You might not notice them, but I do.  Sadly, I also got my Dad's dark circles around the eyes, what he used to call his \"\"two hole burned in a blanket\"\" look, something that has become far more apparent with age, particularly if I am tired, dehydrated or straight out of bed.A few weeks ago the folks at Perfective Ceuticals asked me if I would like to try some of their products.  Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor,Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth FactorandAnti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor.  Since then, I've been using my regular cleaning regimen, followed by the application of the Perfective products.  I must say, I am impressed.  My skin is moister and my lines less apparent,  I've particularly noticed a fairly dramatic difference in the scars, which have become pretty hard to differentiate from ordinary wrinkles, and the no-longer-crepey skin of my neck.  I've also noticed a big difference in my eyes.A tiny bit ofPerfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factordabbed around and under the eye goes a long ways.  While it doesn't completely erase my \"\"hound dog\"\" eyes, the difference that it has made over the last month is readily apparent, even to my most critical eye.Grandma's $0.02 - Next best thing to an eye-lift, and the first thing I've tried that has made a difference in those dark circles!Here's the list of ingredients contained in this product -Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Ethylparaben\"", "This Cream is wonderful. This is not only good for lines and wrinkles though, it also great for relieving  dark circles and puffiness under the eye area. I have been using the product for two weeks and the area around my eyes are smoother and hopefully over time with continuous use it will diminish the little lines I see around my eye area. I can't wait to see what kind of results I get after a full 30 days worth of usage!", "\"I'm 50, and have under eye bags and a few light crow's feet. When Perfective Ceuticals asked if I'd be willing to try their products in exchange for reviewing them, I figured it was worth a try.  But I didn't expect much.  I've used lots of creams and treatments, hoping to reverse some of the inevitable signs of aging, and even liked a few of them.  I like emu oil, but it sometimes caused pimples on my skin.  And it didn't do much for the eye bags.  I liked Olay Regenerist, but I was allergic to something in the formula.I've used Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Imperfection Eye Therapy Cream for three weeks now, applying it to my clean face twice a day, and I'm truly amazed!  My eye bags are reduced, the small lines around my eyes are diminished, and puffiness above and below my eyes is gone. I wish I'd taken before and after pictures because this product has really made a visible difference in my skin.  Even my husband can see the improvement and commented on it.I've had good results with Retin-A in the past, but had some redness and peeling and sun sensitivity, and couldn't use it next to my eyes.  This cream is gentle and absorbs quickly, and doesn't irritate my face, and gives the same type of results.  It's fragrance free, and comes in a generous bottle which will last for months.I would never have considered buying this product for myself because so many expensive \"\"miracle\"\" creams just don't work.  But this product has taken 10 years off of my eye area in just three weeks.  I can't wait to see if it continues to improve the skin around my eyes with several more months of use\"", "Twice a day I have been using the cream. It feels wonderful going on. It is rich, creamy, smooth and absorbs easily. I can't say enough about how nice it feels using it, although luxurious comes to mind. It only takes a small amount to help too. Just a small pea-sized amount is all you need for both eyes.Even after using it for another week I saw that the small problem I have with slightly sagging eye lids is not as bad. Everything around my eyes feels more youthful and healthier and my eyes feel and look brighter. You can even see how the skin is not as puffy under my eye. My skin even feels more supple, something I have not said about it in a long time.This is not a product that you will just be able to run out and purchase on a whim. It is not cheap! But it is so worth every single penny! I have tried lots of companies eye serums and creams and have had varying results, but nothing like this! I can honestly say this has mad a significant improvement in my skin and the total look of my eyes. I highly recommend this to you! I would love to have their whole line of skin care!I received a sample of the cream, but the opinions i shared here are all my own! I really love the stuff!!", "\"When I was asked if I'd like to try Perfective Ceuticals products containing Growth Factor, I was skeptical. I am a 'Doubting Thomas'.  You know 'seeing is believing'. I decided I didn't have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.My first thought: 'If this product line works, how will I prove it?'...you know 'seeing is believing'. So I got out my point and shoot camera & took some before pictures. Oh, my gosh, the pictures I took wouldn't prove anything. Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot. So, I am sorry, but I will not be able to provide evidence for you to see.I'm in my mid 60's, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled  with light colored freckles.  As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily. I've never been a sun worshiper so I don't have many deep wrinkles, just  normal aging wrinkles. In my 50's, my eyelids started getting what I call  'creepy, wrinkly' looking (just looked it up & the term is crepey).  The  wrinkles looked even worse if I wore frosted eye shadow. I eventually stopped wearing most eye shadows & opted instead for a natural, matte color.I've been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly. The skin around my eyes looks younger, the crepey eye lids have improved enough that frosted eye shadow doesn't look all that bad on me now, but I'm not planning on going back to it. My crow's feet are less defined. They're still there - they haven't disappeared - yet they're not as noticeable. I  have small bags under my eyes  which have improved.  Although some days, they're back..so I'm not sure what's going on.  I never had dark circles under my eyes, so I can't comment on that claim.I began as instructed, by applying a pea-sized amount of lotion to my eye area twice a day. That amount ended up being more than enough for two eyes.  So I'm using less now. Being a thrifty person, I also experimented by using this product once a day. It didn't take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  Perfective Ceutical Eye Cream twice a day.  So twice a day it is.  This eye cream isn't heavy  & is absorbed quickly.  It doesn't have any fragrance. Although I don't have sensitive skin, I experienced irritated, watery eyes when I first began using it. After emailing customer service for suggestions, I figured out that I was too careless when I applied the lotion. I was getting it into the corners of my eyes. As soon as I started applying the cream more carefully & avoiding all eye contact, the irritation stopped.Summing up, my crow's feet are less defined, my crepey eye lids have improved a lot, & on most days, my under-eye bags  aren't as puffy. The skin around my eyes definitely looks younger now.  And actually, when I use this eye cream along withAnti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor&Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factortwice a day, I've been told that I look 10 years younger.  My wrinkles haven't disappeared, but are less noticeable. My skin is more  youthful looking.  Just remember that my skin isn't sun damaged and most of my wrinkles aren't deep.Do not store this product in extreme heat or cold.Product guarantee copied from Perfective Ceutical's website:\"\"Perfective Ceuticals' products are designed to be sold exclusively by dermatologists and dermatology professionals.

They're working for me, and they worked quickly. I saw improvement in two days.See my comment for EGF, Epidermal Growth Factor, information.\"", "I've been taking good care of my skin religiously, but I never really paid attention to my around the eye area. Lately, I've been staying up late because of my online work and have been having dark circles and puffy eyes. Plus, my crow's feet are getting deeper. Ugh! It makes me wince every time I look in the mirror. I knew I needed to do something about them and I knew that a simple facial moisturizer won't do the trick.The eye cream has no scent. This is a plus for those who apply make up after prepping their faces because it won't mix with other scents. It is an effective moisturizer because it leaves the skin around the eye area soft and silky smooth. The consistency is creamy and it spreads easily on the skin. There is a little shine after application, but it's absorbed fast and the glossy look goes away when it dries up. I noticed a slight reduction on the puffiness of my eyes after a week of using it. I use it twice daily. There is also an improvement on my dark circles. They are lighter now. As for my crow's feet, I'm not sure if it's just me, but I do think they are less noticeable.All in all I have a great experience with this eye therapy and would recommend this.", "This Eye Therapy also is made with collagen and elastin stimulators to help fight against the four signs of aging eyes: fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness.This awesome product has growth factors (Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) ) in it which is why it works so well! This EGF helps to diminish the length and depth of fine lines, under eye wrinkles and crow&#8217;s feet wrinkles.Then there is the Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) that helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area.Also inside this awesome formula is Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide) that helps under eye wrinkles and crow&#8217;s feet wrinkles to become more resilient to the aging process. Lastly, this formula has Retinol and Ginseng Extract to de-saturate dark circles,You will see more radiant and wrinkle free eyes! I like it because it is Fragrance Free, which I have come to appreciate as I get older. My nose seems to find offense with scents that used to not bother me, but now I get watery eyes anytime I get a whiff of any kind of scent or I will get the sneezes. This Eye Therapy is also Non-comedogenic and Scientifically proven.", "*I received a sample to test for my review, as I am clearly in their demographic of 'older person with wrinklage setting in'.I've used this for two months now, and I'm really impressed. If you have read my other skincare reviews, I'm kind of stuck on how well the Avon ANEW products work. Well, work(ed), since my face had a bad reaction to a cosmetic product awhile back and I'm unable to tolerate most anti-aging products any more. The Anew did what nothing else had: it actually smoothed out my rough spots and lessened the lines I'm starting to see. I gave up on finding another product that would work as well (at any price range) but I definitely have found a mean competitor to the Anew crown in this Perfective Ceuticals eye cream.First of all the price point almost gave me heart failure when I saw it; but 2 months out and the pump on the bottle still feels like it has plenty of product. I may yet get 90 days of use out of this eye cream, which makes the initial purchase price very competitive with even the cheap(er) Avon price point. I use the tiniest dot of product for both eyes, just a fraction of a pump's worth. Maybe the size of say, a grain of rice. Let's get the price point out of the way and focus on what is the most important: results!Do you have hooded eyes like many of us get as we age? That makes eye cream sting and burn your eyes---this cream was thick enough that it didn't go ANYWHERE. I also have problems with my eyes watering quite a bit when they get tired, strained, or dried out. This causes cream to run into my eyes and stings them. This did not happen with the Perfective Ceuticals formula.This eye cream, like many, says to use it day and night. But if you've ever tried to put on eye cream in the daytime and had it make a greasepot out of your eye makeup, you tend to be leery about this usage. I have used it as a hydrating cream in the daytime under my eye makeup (a little or a lot of eye makeup, it all works the same) with great success. You can't even tell that it's under there, as I don't get creasing or greasing! Love that. A bonus is that I'm able to dab a little bit of foundation or concealer under my eye area and I don't have to worry that it's going to sink into my lines, or crease up into lines of demarcation. This cream absorbs right into the skin, and it provides a nice base for me to blend color on top of it without raccoon eyes, crinkles, or anything.But best of all, I have to say that I have actually noticed a general 'smoothness' to my eye area that wasn't there previously. The general texture has improved, both under my eyes and on my eyelids. There is markedly less crepey texture and definitely a reduction in roughness. If you've ever applied a shimmery or frosty eyeshadow and realized that it made you look like a hag by enhancing just how rough/crepy your eyelid area is---you know how much that bites. I am wearing shimmer products again, nothing disco-ball but nice Mally Saddle eyeshadow pencil and some Maybelline Color Tattoo creams; they are going on smooth and easy and don't look like miniature elephant skins!This cream plays well with the acid peels I have been using also, with no stinging or burning. (I use light peels close to my undereye and crows-feet areas)  Overall I am impressed that this eye cream has shown noticeable results and it is something I will buy when this tube runs out. Let's face it, it works, and at my age I don't have time to waste with eye cream that doesn't earn its keep! The price point is comparable to what you'd pay for Lancome or Estee Lauder products (which I've tried with no success) so why not give it a try? So far I've been very impressed with the high quality skincare items they make, and it doesn't hurt that the dispensers they use are of a nice quality and don't break down.Overall am very, very pleased with the results on my older skin from these products!", "\"I use Perfective Ceuticals eye cream over the Perfective Ceuticals serum and then add a layer of Perfective Ceuticals cream for night time. In the morning, I repeat but add a layer of sunscreen.I took before and after photos three weeks apart and let my kids tell me which photos look better. I didn't tell them which was which, but they said the after photos look better because I \"\"look younger.\"\" That's all I needed to know that the Perfective Ceuticals line of skin care products really work.The eye cream may be expensive, but just a little dab will do ya, literally. The directions to apply a pea-size amount is really too much. I describe it more as a pinhead-size for each eye. It's lasted me more than three weeks and hopefully much longer.
