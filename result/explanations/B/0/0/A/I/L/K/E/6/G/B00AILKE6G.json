"], "reviews": ["I have always wanted to try the attachments that come with the hairdryers.  You know, like that diffuser circle?  They always hurt, and I threw them away after a couple of times.  This one didn't get my hair all tangled in it, and it added volume and shine to my hair.It has three settings, from cool to warm to hot that are easily adjustable while drying your hair.  Lightweight and portable, and easily fit into my suitcase for traveling.", "I needed to get a new hairdryer and I saw two Remington's that caught my attention. I ordered both because I wanted to review and compare the two together since they looked similar but one is almost twice the price of the other. I was intrigued as to what makes one pricier than the other.I got theRemington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryerand theRemington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer.The Remington with the Silk Ceramic Ionic features is priced around $40 and the Remington Volume and Shine Dryer is priced around $25. They look similar in the design, shape and color. Even the controls are almost the same.Both dryers have:1875 watts3 heat settings2 speed settingsCool ShotDiffuser attachmentConcentrator attachment90% more ions for volume and shineThe Remington with Silk Ceramic Ionic technology has a couple more features than the Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. The dryer with the Silk Ceramic Ionic technology has just that, the ceramic with silk proteins for the purpose of leaving hair smoother and less frizzy. It also has AC motor that is suppose to be a salon professional motor that gives 50% faster styling and 3x longer life of the motor. It does have a 4 year limited warranty whereas the Remington Volume and Shine Dryer has a 2 year limited warranty.I used both several times to get a feel of the dryer and to which one that I liked personally. I also did a small test myself to determine which one would dry my hair faster and leave it looking better. I towel dried my hair, which is long, thick and coarse. I parted my hair completely in two, pulling apart the two sides. I used a stopwatch and timed myself blow drying my hair dry. I used one dryer on one side and the other dryer on the other side.The results:Both dryers dried my hair in the same amount of time. Both sides of my hair looked exactly the same. The pricier dryer didn't dry my hair faster or make it look any fuller or smoother.To me, the biggest difference was the feel of the dryers. The Remington with Silk Ceramic Technology is a much heavier dryer. The ceramic technology and the heavier motor make the dryer heavier. The Remington Volume and Shine is a very light dryer. I actually prefer the heavier dryer. It just has a nice, comfortable feel in my hand. The lighter Volume and Shine feels cheap to me. It's just a personal preference because some people may like the feel of the lighter one.For me, the performance is the same between the two.", "I have to admit that I've had pretty good luck with hair dryers over all, most last over a decade (this is my 4th one). However, there is one huge standout feature on this Remington model that I especially like.There are two control switches, the first is the on/off and high/low switch. The Second is the temperature control switch with three levels and this is the aspect I love. The first level, runs cool while the second two are warm and hot. Sure it also has the cold shot option, but those only run for as long as you hold down the button. Therefore I really enjoy that I have the option to run on a cool cycle throughout my blow dry. This is great for me as I typically hate using my hairdryer when is it hot out, or I still need to cool down after a workout.Very, very happy with this feature.", "\"I've used many hair dryers over the years, from high-end to drugstore brands.  This particular dryer is nothing special.On the plus side, it is very lightweight, so might be a good choice for someone with impaired arm strength.  But the reason it's so light is it's very cheaply made.  In addition, it doesn't get very hot or blow that strongly.  Every time I use it I stop to see if I have it turned all the way up.  It also has an abnormally short cord.  I didn't notice it at first because I stand close to the outlet, but when I went to dry my daughter's hair, it didn't reach where she normally stands.  Never had that problem with other dryers.And if I may address the \"\"ionic generator creates 90% more conditioning ions, leaving you frizz-free\"\" nonsense.... come on.  It sucks air in one end, heats it, and blows it out the other.  There are no magical particles inside waiting to give you the hair of your dreams.  Alas, wish it was true, but it's not.Overall, while this dryer isn't horrible, there really is no compelling reason to buy it.\"", "It is a change to have a hair dryer that is lightweight. It makes styling easy and allows for quick switching of styling heads.The dryer does come with two attachments.  I tried them both out but do not use them.  They don't stay on the nozzle of the dryer as well as I think they should.  I was left fumbling to replace them. The dryer is more effective without them.  I did not notice a difference in the shine or volume with or without them. Since I started using this dryer, I've gotten tons of compliments about how shiny my hair looks. I do believe it is doing something that is noticeable by others.I have been using this hair dryer as my main dryer for about two months.  Aside from the attachments not staying on as well as I would like them to, I have no complaints about the performance of this dryer.This dryer has three heat settings: hot, warm and cool. The hot is HOT and I disagree with the complaints other reviewers have had with this issue. There are two speed settings, low and high.  The high speed has plenty of power.  I've also read complaints about the length of the cord.  I've haven't had an issue with that as well. The cord length seems standard to me. I can comfortable bend over and dry the underside of my hair. I've even had my sons sit on the bathroom floor to dry their hair (so that they are away from the sink) and the cord has been long enough.Overall, this is a light, simple, dependable dryer that does exactly what it should.  I would purchase this without hesitation.", "I got this dryer for my spouse who is not easy to please. However, to my utter surprise, she loves it. She said it is comfortable to hold, has numerous settings and does a nice job of hair drying. That is quite an endorsement for a product with a fairly low price tag. So, three cheers for me and three cheers for Remington.", "Since I've taken up swimming on a regular basis I decided it would be better and healthier to blow dry my hair before heading outdoors. The blower in the men's locker room was a basic two-speed model that did the job but I wanted more.So I settled on the Remington Volume and Shine Hair Dryer which is relatively light and easy to use. The three speeds and two heat settings make it very easy to avoid my hair frizzling up from overheating.It does come with this diffuser tool which would be nice for the ladies I think but one that I never tried to use. The dryer has two nozzles, one to focus the air stream for smooth hair (good for me) and the other to diffuse the air stream to enhance curls and natural waves (not so much for me).I love this model. It fits easily into my bag, warms up quickly, with the low speed setting and medium heat I can get 'er done quickly and be on my way into the autumn brisk or winter biting air without risk of catching cold or frosting my already gray strands.", "This is a great looking Red Hairdryer.I have medium  thick colored weave in my hair ,kind of short hair, and did not find this hair dryer gave my hairas much movement drying as my Revlon dryer does.I didn't notice any Anti-Friz using this dryer!I think its a good dryer, I have only used it for a couple of weeks, and do notnotice anything different in drying my hair then using my old dryer.It's not a heavy dryer, more lite weight, but using a smaller dryer, is lighter then this one.I gave it 4 star, as it is a good regular everyday Hair Dryer with a good price.The only thing I cannot figure out is, how to clean out the lint that cumulates in the back of a hair dryer!Can't find anyway of opening this up!", "\"I'm not huge on hair styling these days, clich&eacute; or not I do rock the \"\"mommy ponytail\"\" more often than I should, or at least I did before this blow dryer. The issue is I take a shower at night, it's the only time I can really be alone and relax at the end of a long day without little people standing outside of the shower... normally I'd just go to bed with wet hair or let it airdry before bed. Then I'd wake up with bed head, do my best to smash it down and toss in a ponytail. The alternative would be a good 30mins with the straight iron trying to get it to smooth out and lay flat enough to resemble some sort of style.Other blow dryers I've had in the past (including another ionic Remington), really didn't change this process at all... the most they would do is dry my hair before bed.This one seriously changed my life in a little way. The first time I used it I wasn't expecting much, it's a bit heavier than my last and and I'm not a huge fan of red (if you are this is the dryer for you, it's BRIGHT red). However I was shocked when I was done drying my hair. It was shiny and smooth, more smooth than when I use my straight iron and it was done way faster. The best surprise was the next morning when I got up and it was STILL perfectly smooth and shiny. I was able to be out the door in mins without ever even warming up my straightening iron and without the dreaded mommy ponytail.Great blow dryer, great deal!\"", "I just gave up the valiant fight with my hair, and cut it.I always cut my hair myself, and I am not too bad at it.Having a brand new hairdryer to use after I washed it was eye opening for me.  I had been using a very poor quality, very old hairdryer.This roaring red (!!!) Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer is a fantastic change for the better, for me. It makes a huge difference in the look of my spiky short new pixie cut.It comes with a couple of accessories to snap onto the nozzle to style your hair in different ways.I tried the black slotted funnel. This is not THE TECHNICAL TERM.The air directs its force at specific areas of your head with this attachment. It snaps on easily and doesn't fall off. It was perfect for my hair style.The air itself is slightly cooler than the air from my old hairdryer.This is ideal, as anyone knows that blasting hot air at your hair is extremely damaging.I recently read, in fact, that you should be treating your hair as if it were a fine cashmere sweater.This means that vigorous towel drying is NOT recommended; only gentle drying in every way.The Remington, on all speeds and settings, respects the manner in which hair should be dried.The Remington D3020 touts the number of ions it has.You can take that ball and run with it--I have never understood ions.I am very happy with this hairdryer, however, and with its gentle and cooling drying power. Add to that the great attachments, and the reasonable price, and I would absolutely choose this hair dryer, along with its plethora of ions, all over again.Love it!Thanks,jean", "I shave my head, but I live in a house of folks with long hair.We have thick Asian hair, lush wavy, and a couple thinning curly types.Every person who used the dryer had good things to say about how efficient it was at drying hair, not drying out hair, or frizzing it up.'The Hot Rod of Hair Dryers.' Actual quote.Recommended", "I am on the fence about this dryer. Yes it is powerful, but when it gets hot it shuts off.  That may be a safety mechanism, but it doesn't make me happy.  The plug has a reset button and I had to use it the first time I even tried the dryer.  it is also extremely loud.  The cats run and hide when I use it.", "I could only find good things to say about this dryer.  It's strong but does not burn my head,  has multiple setting and two attachments that fit nicely and allow for lots of different styles.  It has a cool button which is great for setting my hair after styling.  It's a bit on the larger side,  but it is still lightweight. The price is exceptional considering the settings and tools it comes with.", "My wife really likes this hair dryer.  The bright red color stands out and my wife is happy with the color.  Even on a low setting, this hair dryer gets the job done with ease.  It is a little bigger than her old one (also a Remington which stopped working right recently after 5 years of use) so it didn't fit in the small drawer, but that isn't a big deal.Best of all, this hair dryer adds volume and is offered at a reasonable price.  If it lasts at least 5 years like the old one, we will be happy.", "This is a great hair dryer.  It can be very hard to tell online or looking at packages how well a dryer will work.  For me, I want one that genuinely gets HOT as I have very coarse, thick hair.  I also want one that puts out a lot of air.  I'm happy to report that this dryer does both of those things well.  It's not wimpy in any way. I am very pleased with it, and the red color just makes it fun.", "This hair dryer is great for the price.  It has plenty of power, plenty of heat, and attachments that rival the higher priced hair dryers.  It is very light weight but not very portable.  My hair has a tendency to be on the frizzy side whether I use a hair dryer or not so when I used this, I expected much the same.  Luckily for me, using the attachments for the first time in my life, I did not have that happen.  At least not immediately.", "This particular hair dryer would be better used on someone with shorter, thinner hair. The power is just not there for someone with thicker, longer or curlier hair. For the most basic of needs it works quite well, but be prepared to spend a little while under the dryer. However I think the price more than makes up for its short-comings. It feels very lightweight and you get some heat/cool settings to play with. It also comes with a couple of diffusers, one of which I never use. My hair is nearly waist-length and quite wavy and it takes forever to dry it with this dryer. I use this only for quick scalp drying and I have a more heavy duty dryer for when I need to completely blow-dry all my hair. For the money it's a pretty good buy, but not ideal for everyone."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06125669926404953, 0.032364677637815475, 0.06660336256027222, 0.0634428858757019, 0.05740271136164665, 0.05985137075185776, 0.058920152485370636, 0.0627172514796257, 0.06124337017536163, 0.04720710590481758, 0.06094563007354736, 0.06062479689717293, 0.06434663385152817, 0.05941516160964966, 0.057360924780368805, 0.06324977427721024, 0.06304741650819778]]}
