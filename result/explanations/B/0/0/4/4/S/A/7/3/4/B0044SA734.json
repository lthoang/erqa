Does not happen to everyone but if it happens to you your game will not be able to progress.  I am referring to the infamous \"\"Silence Falls\"\" dilemma.  If you break a crystal without first having started the quest you will not be able to ever break the 3rd and final crystal.  Even if you regress to an earlier save where the crystal was not ever broken, the game will not forget.  The 3rd crystal will still be unavailable.  If those at EA are wondering why their sales of DLC are poor for this game, they are even dumber than the programmers.  No more EA games for me.  All they had to do was at least admit the fault but they chose to delete any references to this flaw from their site.  Can anyone say \"\"bad for business\"\"?  They can not delete the web though.  This flaw is permanent there, if you do a web search.Another flaw is, the game will allow you salvage the \"\"engraved Virani daggers\"\" which are necessary for the \"\"uprising mission.  This results in a quest failure.Another major quest flaw is if you leave the \"\"aster inheritance\"\" quest after you have the key, you can loose the strongboxes for ever and not be able to finish the quest.  I have 4 out of five but the fifth is lost now.  No chests on the map and definitely no yellow circle.  Update:  You can get the chests to appear if you look at the map in your inventory but they appear only until you interact with something. and then you have to look at the map again.I just found another flaw that stops progress.  If you user the lever to shut the door in one cave (can't remember which) you will not be able to open it again and you can not exit the cave because to get there you had to jump down.  This was my final straw.  I give up on this (yet another)flawed piece of crap that is not being patched yet download content still available.  All take and no give EA.Speaking of yellow circles.  There is a persistent and common issue in this game where the yellow circles that show you where to go, will either disappear during the quest or remain when the quest is complete.\"", "\"Let's do this pros & cons style.Pros:It's like a cross between The Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age. It has openness and freedom similar to TES, but with more visceral combat and better character building like DA. It's very reminiscent of Dragon Age Origins, only with more freedom and a less engaging story.The scenery looks beautiful, though trees and leaves never move (which is only noticeable when you stop to look closely). But would I want that if it caused combat slowdowns? No. I stopped dozens of times just to admire the scenery.The combat is dynamic (making a fight vastly different depending on factors as simple as the terrain), responsive and mostly satisfying. E.g., after downing a troll, his dropped club rolled down a small hill; for some reason, it stayed with me. Very cool.Combat is like a cross between Dragon Age and Demons Souls. And it's not that far below an all combat game like God of War. (But two ability wheels are a must for a sequel.) Amalur has probably the best combat in any RPG I've played.I love the openness of the world (ginormous) and the varied landscapes. Forest, plains, desert, swamp...The flexibility of character building: no classes, just allocate points into whichever tree you want (mage, warrior or rogue). And the ability to completely respec your character whenever you felt like was great.Literally hundreds of quests (I completed 213 with a dozen tasks that could be completed multiple times) with a wide variety of goals.You can name self crafted equipment.Reckoning mode adds a nice twist to RPGs.There are actually some pretty cool cut scenes, epic battles (including a siege) and good boss fights.Cons:No voice for the main character.Names for NPCs, towns and enemies felt a little too \"\"fairy tale-ish\"\"; almost old fashioned and childish.Combat was too easy, even on hard. Potions and even money were abundant. I had almost 3 million gold at one point!Decent voice acting, but terrible lip syncing during conversations.Only four quick slots for powers. So if you want to switch between a healing power and a lightning bolt (while keeping the other three abilities available), you have to go all the way into the menu of your abilities, select the healing spell, place that into a slot, back out into the game world, use that spell, then to go back to the abilities to re-enter the lightning bolt into your quick slot. R2 should've accessed the second ability wheel (instead of activating stealth).It doesn't tell what your critical hit chance is. It would've been helpful to know.No weather effects.Some pop in.The finesse ability tree pales in comparison to might and sorcery.Uneveness of skills: blacksmithing, sagecrafting and detect hidden were easily the best skills, while mercantile, persuasion and lockpicking hardly helped.A level cap of 40. Once I hit that, I lost some enthusiasm for the game (though I regained most of it during the last quest).Conclusion: I feel way too many have focused on the negatives without mentioning the positives of KOA: Reckoning. This is one of the best gaming experiences I've had on the PS3. It's a shame the developer went bankrupt, because I would LOVE a sequel. Hopefully, someone picks up the rights and we get that down the line.PS: The House of Valor quest line (that only comes with new copies) is a great addition and worth the extra $.\"", "I thought this game was really similar to skyrim. It had many tasks you could do and you could go around a huge landscape. Fun battles and cool weapons and armor. If you like skyrim then you will like this game. The only downside is that it gets really repetitious after a while.", "First of all, it took me a long time to finally decide to get this game over Skyrim or Dragons Dogma. End result: very satisfied!Review:Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is amazing. I just bought this game not knowing much about it, only watching videos and reviews of it, so I was a bit scared buying this game. But I was wrong, i became addicted to it so quickly and i love just about everything about it!First off, the story is pretty interesting, no spoilers though, i could expect a little more however. 4/5The sound/music in KoA:R is brilliant, especially when running through the Faelands to your next objective. The sounds of the monsters, voice acting hits on spot, and is entertaining. 5/5Next, the enviroment/graphics are not the best for an rpg, but it has reminded me of several other game enviroments , which filled me with nostalgia. 4.5/5Ok, the best part of the game is gameplay. What makes this game so appealing is that it is more of a hack n slash rpg, rather one of stategy, like dark souls. Ive heard people comparing the combat to God of War, which i could relate to, as there are many combos to pull of with various weapons. 5/5For additional details, this game is huge. I am currently 51 hours in, with almost all of the main  quest done, about 40 side quests on standby, and maybe another 20 side quests still yet to find.This game has a great leveling system and a very helpful feature where you can reset your charcter's skills and abilities, although it costs money. Also, in my opinion, as you level up, you actually feel stronger, and find much better weapons, which should be key for all RPGs.Lastly i have to say that this game is very fun and long, so it will keep you entertained for a while.Note: the only flaw with this game is that if you are in a large group of enemies, you have a pretty good chance to be continuously hit and get chain-stunned, which gives you no control whatsoever and whittles away your health, but there are abilities that help you overcome that. Great game either way, and i hope theres a sequel soon! Great job EA/Big Huge Games!", "The graphics on the characters look bad, the design of characters are all pretty similar, but the story and combat is great, and the world looks great. Highly recommend.", "\"I waited until the release of this game to purchase because I am more of an RPGer than an pure action type of gamer (for the most part), and wanted to find out exactly how \"\"RPG-like\"\" this game was.  After reading it was very much like an RPG, I bought it right away.  This definitely isn't the best RPG ever, but is it worth your time if you love RPGs?  Yes, probably.Is this Skyrim?  No.  It's not as big or in-depth, but it is a large game with plenty of quests and things to do.  Overall, I enjoy Skyrim more than this game, but if you get a little tired of the bleak atmosphere in Skyrim or a really annoying glitch (with huge Bethesda games comes lots of glitches), then switch right over to this bright, sunny relatively glitch-free world.Graphics - they are stunningly beautiful, at least to me.  Some complain that they are a little cartoonish/\"\"Fable-like,\"\" but I found them to be a perfect mixture of the cartoon graphics and realism.  It's very stylized and sleek.  The world is so bright and beautiful, which is really different than a lot of the darker RPGs these days.Battle system - first, the fluidity of the character's movements is amazing.  I haven't seen anything quite as fluid in an action-RPG in a long time.  The battle system is relatively simple, and you can choose what kind of \"\"destiny\"\" you wish to have (rogue, warrior, mage) and change it at any time.  It is completely possible to master all three throughout the game.The fighting itself is obviously not turn-based, and reminds me a lot of Devil May Cry or Gods of War.  In \"\"reckoning mode,\"\" (a bar that fills up after hacking and slashing) you are this unstoppable force where you perform little moves on your controller to defeat enemies with extra strength and HP.  Some have complained that the game is too hack and slash.  If you find this to be an issue, I recommend making the difficulty a bit harder.  At the moment there is no hardcore mode, but hopefully that will come out to please some gamers.Storyline - the storyline isn't bad and some are better than others.  There are TONS of sidequests at every corner, and some become a little repetitive.  I love the amount of characters that I am able to talk to, however, and learn their opinion on things.My least favorite parts about this game are....Dialogue options - it doesn't feel like my dialogue options matter at all.  You don't get too many, and when you do, what you choose doesn't really matter.  Maybe I'll see more of an affect from my options, but I'm starting to doubt it.No followers - yes, no companions, no followers; you are all alone.  Every now and then someone will follow you around and assist you with a quest, but no awesome dialogue with companions.  That is quite a bummer and something I was hoping would be in the game.Ko:A isn't super linear, but it's not a sandbox world like Skyrim, either.  Mobs seem to always re-spawn in the same place, what you do is somewhat limited, etc.  For a casual RPG gamer, this is a great buy.  You'll spend countless of hours having fun on quests and discovering the world.  For the more hardcore, classic RPGers, you might not like this, OR you'll have to be open-minded.  It's not a BioWare game like Dragon Age where you get to know your companions really well and influence so many of the storylines, and it's not like a Bethesda game (Fallout, Elder Scrolls) where you have this massive sandbox world where you can do anything you want.  It's a little scaled down, but still fun.  I'll say that it's a casual, nice change of pace from your regular intense RPG.\"", "I could not help myself.  I have this game on the 360 and it was such a mind blowing experience i went out and got it for my PS3.  My character is a Female Battlemage.  Your destiny is based on the style of gameplay and how you choose to level up.  In Skyrim there are Reckless Mages but in Amalur the Mages are Deliberate.  Did i say the Mages can Fly around and re-spawn?  I found myself caught in a battle with 2 mages and 4 warrior soldiers.  Before i could even get one hit in i was torn apart with a flurry of Magic and weapon attacks.  They hit me with fireballs, lighting bolts/balls and something that looks like mini tornadoes.  The warriors all had great swords that stun locked me and once you are stun locked the Mages will have a field day.  My Primary weapon is a Lightning Longsword laced with fire and poison.  My secondary weapon is the Septer that deal out Ice and freezing magic.  I also like the Daggers and the Charmars or those Disc you throw.The world is not as large or spectacular as Skyrim but what it lacks in visuals it more than make up for it in COMBAT.  Each battle and enemy is unique.  The fights with the giant TROLLS are SICK.  You must learn to use the world to your advantage in order to fight these GIANTS.  They have a HOMING charging attack that will hit you 95% of the time so you must be quick with your rolls or you will die.  Did i mention the spiders that will gang up on you and spit out poison and webs?  Did i mention the female characters are very SEXY...GEEEZ???It has a cartoonish feel to it but the style of the game itself will satisfy any gamer thats into ACTION/ADVENTURE/RPG style of games. You will get at least 100 hours out this game so its very much worth the money....", "This game was highly rated which led to me buying it. Honestly, it was quite boring. You are sent to do quests (Main, Faction, Side, and Tasks) and will at any given point have over 20 to do at the same time. It doesn't sound bad, but that just means you are constantly running from place to place and never really getting a chance to work on the story. Running around for hours just gets boring and all of the side quests seem like more of a chore than an enjoyable game. Another awful this about this game is the combat. It is extremely repetitive with little variation which is sad in a game as long and thought out as this one is. It froze on me twice and has a couple of problems that could mess you up (not letting you drop quest items even after the quest is over so you can't carry as much for the rest of the game). The game isn't all bad, the graphics are nice and it does have a lot to do in the game (meaning it is long). If you did every quest in the game (without DLC) you would be looking to be around 70 hours of gameplay. Overall, I would say it is a 5 out of 10 easliy one of the 5 worst games I own. If you are looking for a good RPG of this style (swords, archers, wizards) I would recommend Dragon's Dogma. Much better combat and story with more hours of gameplay.", "\"I must say, I'm impressed!  I only have several hours into this game, but it has me hooked!  Though this game gets great reviews, it didn't seem to make much of a splash when it hit the shelves.  I pre-ordered it, and finally got the time to fire it up.  If I were to compare it to other games, it seems like it's closer to Fable or Nier, than it is to other RPG's like The Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy.***Sound, Graphics and Technical Stuff***The graphics in this game remind me a bit of WoW - not so much as a direct copy - just in spirit!  You'll see lots of vivid colors and a slight cartooniness throughout the game.  The voice acting is top notch, though the lip syncing leaves a little to be desired (no real bearing on the over all quality, though!)  KoA: Reckoning also feels fairly polished.  The frame-rates are largely stable, and I haven't dealt with any crashes or glitches.Those interested in padding their trophy list will be happy - I think there are 100 or so available in KoA: Reckoning.  Many of which are awarded just for playing a game (and might be hidden.)***Game Play and RPG Elements***So far, the story has my attention, and I'm eager to see what happens next.  The side quests are numerous and for the most part, rather interesting.  Right off the bat in games like Skyrim, Oblivion or Fallout, I often feel overwhelmed.  This feeling frequently stays for the first several hours of play time.  Kingdom of Amalur, on the other hand, feels quite welcoming as soon as you start!  Things aren't nearly as forced as they are in say a Final Fantasy game, but not being as open as the more sandboxy titles is actually a welcome change of pace!Questing feels almost exactly like it did in WoW.  They even highlight quest-givers with yellow \"\"!\"\" and \"\"?\"\" when they have a quest to give or receive.  If you're not familiar with these, let me sum it up:  The world of Amalur, or whatever they call it, is filled with lazy and weak people that make you do their bidding.  The quests consist of target hunts, gathering of items/goods, acquiring goods (like make potion X or buy item Y, and bring it back,) and clear dungeon Z.  Rewards are given in experience points, and often money/items.I really like the way you can custom-build your character, and not feel pressure (you can redo your \"\"spec,\"\" if you wish!)  The crafting system is also nice - simple,  yet effective.  Combat is also nicely done here.  There is enough button-pushing to make you feel engaged the whole time, but not overly done, like they do in some other Action RPG's.  Leveling up is easy enough in this game.  As I mentioned before, quests grant experience, as does combat and finding various things (stones, hidden treasures, etc) while exploring and opening locked chests.The crafting system is simplified enough to not be confusing.  You can salvage your weapons and armor, which provides you with parts to make new things.  Relying on only salvaging, however, is a crap-shoot.  After salvaging countless weapons and armors, I still haven't found the right things to make a chest piece for my rogue.  Many shops will sell you components (often really high end ones, too) for a price.  Alchemy works in very much the same way it does in other big MMO's or sandbox RPG's - find herbs in the wild and combine for potion effects.Ultimately, I highly recommend this title!\"", "i purchased this game one week agoits a great Arpg gamewondering why game spot gave this game such a low score!!!", "\"Well, let me first start by saying that when I began this game, I really, really, really didn't like it; I thought it too much a Dark Souls-Skyrim-Dragon's Dogma rip-off.However, I was bored enough to continue playing. And, at the fifteen hour mark, it started to catch and it all made sense; sure this game takes many of its components from other highly successful RPGs, but it does it in a style completely all its own.It can get extremely overwhelming at time, especially when you've got 3 main objectives, 25 side-quests and 5 to 10 tasks, but I've simply controlled my rate at which I take on quests so I don't get overwhelmed and confused.Of course, this game is far from perfect; the bow and arrow system (auto-targeting) is weak (in my opinion), and the map is a pain in the buttocks -- not to mention how difficult and confusing it is to switch between quests and the map. I also hate how you have to destroy items (or sell them) if you fill up your inventory; although this is nice later in the game if you invest in the \"\"Mercantile\"\" skill, then, you get paid for every item you destroy (and anyone who's played the game knows you do A LOT of item destroying in the beginning).Graphically the game is beautiful, although a little \"\"cartooney.\"\" Personally, I prefer more realistic looking RPGs, e.g. Dark Souls. Regardless, this hasn't affected the fun or playability of the game.So, in a nutshell, this game's a slow starter but really grabs hold when it counts. It's fun, entertaining and worth the money. And, most importantly, it'll keep me occupied until the Dawnguard DLC drops in September.\"", "I got really hooked into this game after 3 days of playing. it's kinda hard to like this at first try, better give this more time to see how this game is worth playing. this is like diablo to me coz the map is really big & a lot of side quests. You can also customize your character from girl to boy, tattooed or not, black lipstick to red, more eye shadow or less. over all,this game is very long. but fun. :D", "More or less look at the other 4-5 star reviews on this game.Is it perfect? No.It does NOT have a story to equal say Mass effect. (I will go out on a limb and say it does come close to Dragon Age.)Played through and at 60 Hrs in I have not encountered any bugs that I can tell. (One thing it has over Skyrim.My best way to sum it up would be the Fable style, with actual risk for your character, and real customization.", "Background:- Play it around 90 hours- Completed around 200+ questsEvaluationThe most serious issue, is how easy the game is, game fighting mechanics are great, juggle combos, evasion, magic and special abilities, blocking, parry attacks and everything... so is quite easy to kill the mobsYou can craft your gear, and if you master crafting and sagecrafting, that is quite easy early in the game, the resulting gear will be better than any gear found in the game, so... then you stop looking at what you pickup or what the shops have to offer.You can reset your character N times, just have to pay, early in the game it would be hard, but later on money isn't a problem, the game get so easy that you don't even need to use potions....Good graphics, decent storyline, but it's killed by how easy the game becomes as you progress specially if you switch to a Mage... that's like a walking God, let's say I killed groups of 10 enemies in less than 10 seconds in the last part of the game.", "Hi,I am only about 5hrs into the game but I am really enjoying everything Curt Shilling and his team put into this game.The graphics are colorfull and up there with the best I have seen.The quest and map system is really layed out well so you dont have to wander around you know where to go.The combat is fast and fluid and the weapons are great.  You can use a sword, a bow, daggers, a staff, magic, and use can use like 4 different types of weapons at once.  You can block with a shield, roll, go in sword swinging, use stealth and do a silent kill with daggers, lots of options for varied combat.The character models look good.  I play as a female and the armor makes her look like a female even her helmet.  And some of the swords are as big as the character.Tons of quests and enemies and big bosses.There are combos you can use and allot of character customization from the look of your character to increasing different attributes and learning combos when you level up.The tutorial is integrated good into the game so it does not seem like a tutorial.Just about everything that they could have done right is in this game.If you like rpg's but need some fast fluid arcade like combat this is the game for you.The game seems huge.  Been playing for 5hrs and finished 4 or 5 quests.  Only 1 mission based.  A lot of the quests have more than one part and this makes them seem better than just killing this guy or getting this item.  They seem more like an adventure.  I would say so far good story.Loading times are quick.Also something rare for a 3rd person game.  So far no bugs.Usually when I get a game I am thinking about the next big thing that is coming out.  But I think I will be content with Reckonong for a long time.Kevin", "I'm not sure why so many people love this game but it was a waste of time for me.  I got it on PlayStation Plus and definitely felt letdown even though I didn't have to &#34;pay&#34; for it specifically.  The storyline seemed boring, the NPCs were bland and seemed a little overdone with fetch quests.  Limited character build options, acquiring gold being pretty useless and an overall game with an identity crisis made it very easy for me to move on to better games.Keep in mind, I didn't play-through the entire game.  I really did't have the desire to keep going.", "very bright and beautiful....combat is fluid and satisfying...This is a Solid action RPG although I like mine a little more open and free roam but this game is very fun", "This game is incredibly dull and features some of the worst character and world design I have seen in a long, long time. Everything about this game is a rip-off , from the cheesy characters, costumes, architecture to the generic lore and story. Its heavily influenced by 90s american fantasy design a la battle chasers with giant shoulder pads and bright colors. If you've played world of warcraft, darksiders etc. you get the drift. Very childish and cartoonish. Gameplay is a fable ripoff. Story is deathly dull. Piles of decaying corpses all wear black boxer briefs for some unkown reason. Avoid this total piece of junk, there are much better designed games available. Like Dark Souls.", "\"In a world where we have Elder Scrolls or the equally fabulous Dragon Age from Bioware, is there room for another high fantasy RPG?The answer is a resounding YES.  With a game studio founded by former major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, Kindoms of Amalur:  Reckoning (KAR) is an immensely detailed world.  The game guide is about as thick as Skyrim's and the wide variety of class choices and skills are there as well.Your character awakens in a pile of corpses only to realize that his/her existence is owed to the Gnomes' creation of the Well of Souls...and you are their first success.  Although everyone else in this world has Fate interweaved with their being in an almost Calvinsitic pre-determined sense, your character's first Fate-reading reveals that your Destiny is open.  With your origin and blank slate of Fate a mystery, you journey forth and examine your own mystery as well as go out and find your own purpose in this world.  You can cast spells, become a rogue, a fighter, etc., or become a hybrid of all these.  Personally, I'm following a fighter/mage path and selecting my \"\"Destiny\"\" according to my mood (since you are \"\"fateless.\"\").How does the gameplay fare?  Well, conversations are similar to Bioware's conversation wheel scheme.  Skills and perks follow Elder Scroll's scheme, albeit a somewhat watered down version of it.  Where I find a siginifcant difference, however, is combat.  Imagine a combat scheme that is a hybrid of Elder Scrolls and God of War.  Yes, I said God of War.  You start out with a basic move of swinging your sword about with a variant of holding down the attack button after your first attack to perform a vicious upper-handed blade strike.  As you develop your character, you'll be able to unlock additional combat moves for devastating effect.  Other weapons, like daggers, move a lot faster and the combat style requires you to rethink your attack strategies.  You also can wield shields, bow and arrow, etc. as well as staves and other magical items to wield fire, ice, lightning, etc.  It's one thing about this game that I like above Elder Scrolls; combat FEELS like I'm delivering blows rather than the \"\"floaty sword swing\"\" that I find in Elder Scrolls.  I'm not knocking Elder Scrolls, mind you; I love Elder Scrolls immensely, but I find the combat scheme in KAR a great deal more satisfying, eliciting an \"\"ooooo\"\" when I manage to great a devastating blow in.Artistically, KAR is stunning.  Todd McFarlane's name is shown on the label and his artistic influence shows quite strongly.  It's extremely colorful and creatures are vastly different from one another.  Lighting and particle effects are beautiful and the framerate doesn't appear to be impacted by the visual feast on the PS3.  Entering an inn, I'm greeted with warm colors and a fireplace.  I can only imagine that the PC version is even more impressive.  However, for a PS3 title, kudos to the developers for creating a smooth-running gorgeous game.  This is in stark contrast to Skyrim which seems washed out, cold, and barren.  That said, Skyrim fits its setting; the Nords are SUPPOSED to be living in such a place.  However, KAR has me running back to it sooner simply because this is a world teeming with life...life that I would love to preserve through adventuring.This is a pretty watered down review, but I welcome any questions via comments.  I'm having a great time with this game and I think that you would be proud to have this beside Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls on your shelf.-- Edit 4/23/2012 --Twenty hours into the game and I've barely scratched the surface.  I find myself enjoying the side quests and faction quests immensely and I'm taking full advantage of both to build my character up.  It's amazingly fun and addictive; I just completed the House of Ballads faction quest and the Fae race is truly created around a concept that we find alien.  They are not simply a race that looks different; they embody a culture and history that is based on repetitive pre-destined stories...but something has gone awry.  I won't spoil it; however, you can bet that your character impacts a lot of what happens in this world...you're more special than you know.  Great high fantasy!!\"", "\"The real question is would Kingdoms of Amalur get all the attention it has if it weren't pushed by EA's huge marketing campaign?I highly doubt it.I love RPG's and as big as my collection is this is the weakest title on the shelf. What is Kingdoms of Amalur? It's like EA took ideas and concepts that were popular in other games we've been playing over the past 10 years, mixed them up in a bag, and then created this game and tried to tell us it's new. This is a new game that feels very old.It may provide a new feeling or area of game play to those not really familiar with free roam RPG's or MMO's but if you've played those 2 genre's off the bat you'll just get flashbacks.What Kingdoms of Amalur does well is creating a console MMO without the other players. You can feel where this game was supposed to be an MMO because it acts like one right down to the stale NPC conversations and expressions.What makes this game not work is that the story isn't very unique and the NPC's lack of emotions don't help to sell the story to you either. It's the same Evil Lord story we've all heard about 1000times this one just cut and pasted differently. I really do play RPG's for the story but those one just didn't make me feel like I cared enough about it because it's been done to death.On top of that Sundae is also the gameply which relies down to a \"\"single\"\" action button which makes combat very simple. Now here is the thing about Kingdoms of Amalur, they tried to tie in the idea of using different abilities like using a bow,stealth kills,spells,etc. and then tie them up into one single action button. That may be fine for 1989 but with a 6Axis in 2012 I think they could do much better. I give Two Worlds 2 the Credit for their combat system of making combat unique and mapping different skills to the controls that made you feel like you were in a battle and not just pressing an \"\"action\"\" button. What took KOA down is that I've seen their fighting concept done much better in Two Words II yet a game like that gets worse ratings. Also the Stealth sneak kill and bow attacks feel cut and pasted right out of Two Worlds 2.So with the story and gameplay aside what is KOA really left with? Graphics?The graphic style and atmosphere of the game I need not even speak what it reminds people of. The art style of the game isn't exactly fresh or new and neither or the dwarfs with their accents and pastel colored florescent landscapes of the game. Been there done that and everything in this game reminds me of other cities I've been to in other RPG's.So with a borrowed art style what's left to be new?Class build possibilities? This being a console game that hardly matters really. Usually people argue about mixing class abilities its in MMO's. It doesn't matte what class you make in an offline game because your not going to get 10-25 of your friends (if you have any) and take down a raid boss or climb arena ranks.Maybe Unique Character Personalities?In KOA your characters a mute blank slate. No personality and no dialog which makes the game even less interesting than it already is. Once again I use Two Worlds 2 as an example. Your character has no name but he still talks and has a personality. Although you choose the decisions your choices are what gives him personality. He's either a bad guy or a good guy but he has a conscience about his actions that he hints his thoughts on in the quest journal. Your not just a mindless \"\"action button\"\" mashing ape, your an actual character in that world that can talk to the other characters and interact with them and change their story/fate if you wish to do so. To me that is the direction Freewill/open world games like KOA should be going in.The bottom line is that KOA is getting credit or at least hype over ideas that they either do worse than other games or borrowed from other games.As a budget bin title this would be worth the purchase for a RPG collector. For someone that wants to experience MMO like game play on a console this would be best suited for them but for someone that's a fan or RPG's and plays them like nothing, this is just like buying what you already own.\"", "\"I prefer the look of Skyrim over Amalur, but during fights, the controls in Skyrim are sluggish and unresponsive, while Amalur's controls are spot on perfect. Skyrim's bugs were so bad they actually depressed me because I had to wait for four patches from Bethesda before I could finish the game. After 7 hours of play, Amalur so far has yielded no bugs. I don't care much for the boring backstory, nor have I developed attachments to any of the characters, but damn is this game fun. The combat styles and character classes are varied enough to mix, match, and chain all manner of attacks--swords, chakrams, daggers, arrows, magic, plus power attacks, \"\"Reckoning\"\" mode, etc. I don't miss Skyrim at all.\"", "a gift.. got it at a good price a friend told me that this has a good story to the game and a lot of replay so I'm happy with that", "Man, this is the game! It's not the typical RPG, but an action game that has beautifully become an action-RPG. Did you like Fable? Did you enjoy playing God of War? Have you been waiting for an immense world like Skyrim with lots to do, but without the bugs, glitches, and unplayable lags? Buddy, here's your game. Don't get me wrong, I love Skyrim. Skyrim is an awesome game, the almost perfect game, except for the bugs, glitches, and lags. Here, you have a fluid combat, beautiful environments, hours and hours of gameplay, hundreds of quests, a great and intriguing story. It's not perfect though, but you will enjoy playing hours, and feel fulfilled for having this one. I'm enjoying this game, and you will too. If you like the titles I mentioned, you should buy Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, you will not regret it.", "First off the many graphical glitches the demo had aren't present in the game. Kingdoms of Amalur is a good game. Its art style is similar to Fable with more of a deeper RPG feel. The game has everything needed to keep players busy for many hours. There are multiple side quests, several ways to build your character from mages to warriors and rogues. The real fun of this game is the battle system and many weapon types. The combat isn't boring like some games get. The games crafting and smithing system work well once you level them up. You only get one point at a time so you have to decide what area you are going to focus on. This means you won't be both a master smith and alchemist at least not early in the game. Your level in each area determines what items you find to use so it's a bit restrictive. The dialog system is odd as sometimes you get a dialog wheel and other times you get one word to click on. It works but doesn't feel quite like you're having a conversation. The characters I've encountered have more to say so you get some background on why you are doing the quest un like Skyrim where people just said hey go get this for me. I recommend the game because its battles are fun the story has some detail and you can play how you want. The developer claims there's over 200 hours of quests and I believe them since there are quests everywhere.Update: You can redistribute your skills and change your character build for a reasonable fee. If you no longer want to be say a mage you can switch your skill set to something else. I am finding the merchants prices on items and to be a bit high on items though. Gold isn't made so quickly like some games so you need to spend carefully. The game has many spells you can learn but you can only map 4 at a time. It would have been nice if they made a way to map more spells for use.Update: There's a lot of side-quests lore and collectables in the game.  The main story is not its strongest point as most of what's going in the world is learned by exploring new areas and doing quests.  You can't really power level to max all skills nor do you need to. The weapon smithing and gem crafting are fun when fully leveled up.  My only 2 gripes with the game are its inventory system is severely limited for space and the menus are clunky to scroll through. The 4 spell limit is a bummer too because it forces you to really choose what spells you like.  (The way both Dragon Age games used the R2 button to double scroll the buttons would have have really helped this game out.)  I do really enjoy playing this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Rpgs.ProsMany ways to play the game mages warriors or stealth roguesPlay how you want...steel, sneak and many quests allow a peaceful or combative solution.Detailed alchemy crafting and smithing systemsFun battle systemMany side questsBeautiful environments with a huge world to exploreGood story and voice acting.100+ hours of play timeDoesn't lock up my PS3ConsRestrictive leveling only 1 point per level to spend on skills like smithing alchemy sneaking persuasion etc. It takes several points to max an area so you'll want to focus on being either a mage rogue or warrior. This can be changed for money but you still wont be able to max all skills until at very high levelsSome of the graphics on the characters look like they needed more polishSometimes the camera goes off into la la land in conversations.Load times are around 20-30 seconds when entering buildings (it varies some go fast some are slow)Some slowdowns with graphics engine when a lot is going on.Camera can blind you at times in combatI encountered a nasty glitch that made the whole TV screen twitch every 10 seconds and it would not go away until a previous save was loaded. My character got stuck in a spell cast mode during a battle so I lost a half hour of play time.Only able to use 4 spells at a timeSome minor graphical hiccups occur in some spots", "I have been playing this game on my PS3 now for more than a week now, and have been loving every moment. I feel it successfully combines the classic character building and quest aspects of an RPG with the button mashing of a fighter or a game like Fable. The thing about the mashing though is that while you can simply mash away, you can also incorporate strategy and positioning into the combat situations. When is the exact perfect moment to unleash a chain lightning spell, then close in while the enemy or enemies are stunned and finish the job? When should you blink out of danger only to immediately ambush the same critters with meteoric fire? Although you do mash buttons, the better you get at combat, the less you do so, and more you use selective mashing to accomplish fantastic things. The setting itself is vibrant, lush, and colorful, and as you travel through the various lands, the geography changes accordingly. There is forest, swamp, high desert, coastal settings, etc...The story itself is very entertaining, and the characters within are fun and cool. You definitely feel the classic Salvatore writing style in full effect here. While things play out in ways that any person can attach themselves emotionally to, things also end up larger than life.I haven't finished the game yet, but my character is level 30 at this point. I will update this as things progress, but i can say with confidence now that this is a completely engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable game, and i am loving every moment of it. So much so that i have wasted two weekends staring at my tv screen with a controller in my hands, sometimes forgetting to eat, and barely getting any sleep at all. Man do my eyes kind of burn at this moment. :)", "A great RPG game to add to anyone's game library as you explore,roam,fight,main and pretty much do what you want in this fantasy world.  Still I do say try a demo of the game if you're unsure while I and many others enjoy the game and might not be for you so better to be safe then sorry.", "Awesome game. Took me 109 hours to get to the end, and I listened to all of the poeple talking. Missed a few quests, mainly in Detyre, but that is ok. My old personal longest time was 103 hours, with Fallout 3, but that took me 15 months and Amalur was in one month.Combat is great. I played a Prodigy-Warrior and had top warrior tier abilities. Very nice.I love how doors sound when opened - HA!Anyway, this is a solid top-genre game, worth every penny and second.

Combat is liquid.  Doesn't get bogged down in details.  Highly customizable characters/magic/combat system.  Beautiful artwork.  Voice acting is very well done.  I like the destiny system and tarot cards.  If you like RPG's, or are growing tired of the WoW/Star Wars/EQ2/Guild Wars stuff, this is a breath of fresh air.  Highly recommended.EDIT:  I picked up the strategy guide for this game... WOW.. it 600 pages of small print information.  Nice illustrations and maps.  Monster compendium and walkthroughs.  Impressive.Please make more DLC avaialable guys..  Looking forwards to sequels!", "God of War in an rpg world, I cant speak for everyone else but I bought this game strictly for the combat. I am so happy, I love everything about this game. The music is good, the world is beautiful, the story is interesting, the fighting is too much fun and brutal. I am playing this over The Darkness 2 because the combat is just so much fun and the questing always lead to new areas and new creatures, I am glad that they changed it from MMO to what it is now and I hope they release a sequel where they just expand on everything that is awesome in this game. Because I accidentally ordered this for my Ps3 I am now playing my Ps3 more then my 360 slim. This game is a must buy, the demo had so many bugs and issues but the final product is perfect in my eyes."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.005585627630352974, 0.03844832628965378, 0.02615700662136078, 0.06853456795215607, 0.04243021085858345, 0.0027475901879370213, 0.038592103868722916, 0.0826505497097969, 0.0015575074357911944, 0.06128190830349922, 0.04000111296772957, 0.03425634652376175, 0.03157477453351021, 0.05140822008252144, 0.03336102142930031, 0.07153861969709396, 0.04242558032274246, 0.006388254463672638, 0.0004941348452121019, 0.008937597274780273, 0.02269887924194336, 0.04336896538734436, 0.01496607344597578, 0.03931010514497757, 0.03628155589103699, 0.021530285477638245, 0.00818345695734024, 0.0604674331843853, 0.06482218950986862]]}
