At the volume I listen to it, the quality of sound is satisfactory.  I am not turning the volume all the way up because I now my speakers cannot handle the full power.  So, I did not encounter the distortion some are talking about.  I think this receiver can serve successfully as a budget home theater stereo receiver in smaller rooms especially if you do not want it to be super loud and do not care about multi-channel sound.", "Before purchasing the Yamaha, I had narrowed my search down to Yamaha, Harmon-Kardon, and Marantz.  For my own personal preferences, I made the right choice.  I just wanted a solid stereo receiver so I could listen to music played through my other audio components, without all of the extra connections for video, etc..  This Yamaha receiver had the best variety of analog connections that would allow me to attach all of my older stereo components.  I also liked the fact that it has manual dials on the front to control volume, balance, bass, treble, etc., instead of only being able to control those functions using a remote control.  You can still control basic functions like volume, mute, and speaker on/off with the remote that comes with this Yamaha, but I still prefer the option of walking up to the receiver and making all of my audio adjustments manually.  My only wish is that this receiver had connections for a third set of speakers, but that is minor when considering the overall scope of everything else it has.  I replaced a great 50W x 2 Pioneer receiver that I had purchased back in 1973 with this new Yamaha receiver, but I am still using two sets of Harmon-Kardon speakers that I also purchased in 1973.  They sound great with this new receiver.  Here is a list of the other audio components that I have connected to this Yamaha R-S700BL; an Akai cassette player-recorder, a Phillips CD player-recorder, a Technics turntable, and a Panasonic 4-track Reel-to-Reel player-recorder.  All of them connected easily, and the playback sound is great through this Yamaha receiver.  I could not be happier about my selection.", "A good unit for those that want to play their music and don't need to put a fancy amplifier with surround sound with their TV.  There is plenty of power to drive my large Kenwood 6-way speakers with good sound and plenty of volume.I use both speaker outputs driving both the Kenwood's and JVC&#8217;s.  I can use the outputs separately or together.  This unit was easy to install and I use Input 1 for my wireless receiver antenna to play MP3 music from my computer.I've used both the CD input and the computer music to test the system with excellent results. I may use the other two for other devices in the future. A good piece of equipment without the high cost.Pros:- A basic, no frills tuner amplifier. It replaced my over-complicated surround sound amp that quit. All I do is play CD's and pipe in MP3 music from my computer. This unit has enough power (100W) per side to drive my large 6 way speakers and produce a good sound with plenty of volume. It also has connections on the back for two sets of speakers, which I use. Good basic unit, not expensive and fine for enjoying my music.Cons:- Very plain black face. Not easy to read button and knob labels. Reasonable lighted information window to see which settings are made. Must read manual to program FM stations before use. (Still need to do)", "This is a well made, good value, mature stereo receiver. If this is what you need then, I think you'll be happy with it.Even though I've released 2 iOS apps to locate radio stations, I don't listen to a lot of radio. I must say, however, this receiver does a credible job locking onto a signal and delivering it without a lot of hiss. The FM tuner pulls in the stations it should from my basement: the 5 kW station 3 miles away, the 0.95 kW station 7 miles away, the 11.5 kW station 14 miles away, etc. It doesn't perform miracles, so no to the 0.01 kW station 14 miles away.But, of course, 'receivers' are not so much about receiving these days and more about being a sound hub. So I hooked up an old Blu-ray player to its analog RCA inputs and started listening to CDs. Very nice and clear. I think speakers have more to do with sound quality than the receiver, but this receiver certainly wasn't detracting from it. I was using some fairly hot 4 Ohm book shelf speakers and they sounded great.Controls are basic and a bit small. The remote is utilitarian and boxy; sort of hard to find the volume up/down buttons.Some competing products have a sub-woofer pre-out making 2.1 usage possible.As for why I labeled this a niche product, I went looking online for a cheap Blu-ray player I could pair with this: maybe make a little movie watching cubby when paired with a spare monitor, and I found that most players these days don't come with analog outputs. Sound outputting devices these days put out HDMI and, if you're lucky, optical. Fewer and fewer of my devices have line-out analog. So I could hook up an Airport Express to this receiver, but not an AppleTV; a Wii U but not an Xbox One. This is a buggy whip of a product, but a nicely made one.", "If you don't need surround sound and just need a 2 channel amp, this is great.  It sounds great with my four speakers wired in series. It's basic but does the job.", "I got some new bookshelf speakers and needed something to direct the sound to it. This was great for the $150. I now port all my sound to this, which kicks out all I need to the speakers.I have to keep this as a pretty low volume, which still can be heard from a good distance. I can't crank it when I want to because I use it at work. But I've been more than happy with this.I have to admit, I did have to test it and show it off a few times, in which case I'll just put on some bass-heavy music and crank it for a few seconds. Nobody has been disappointed yet.If I had any complaint is that it tends to go to sleep overnight. I need to figure out how I can turn that off, if it's even an option.Oh, and the headphone jack in the front. Keep in mind that just plugging in headphones does not mute the speaker sound, it will then play through both the speakers and your headphones, so if you are listening to something you don't want anybody else to hear (such as music with grown-up lyrics), make sure you hit the &#34;speaker A&#34; button, which then turns off the speakers and makes it so the sound only goes through your headset.", "Let me very clear from the start. This unit does perform very well, musically, with my Infinity Kappa 8 tower speakers, that have been known to drop down as low as 1 ohm on heavily recorded bass. Also, it is my 2nd purchase of a Yamaha product. I have a Yamaha RS-671 home theater receiver that I absolutely love. It performs very well with the surround sound for movies. However, my main complaint with this stereo receiver is because of 2 things. There is no phono pre-amp input for a turntable (most of their competition offer this) and there is no 120 volt pass-thru plug in the back of the receiver to plug in your cd player so both units will turn on at the same time. Again. let me say the receiver performs as promised and I am happy about that, but the omission of those 2 items just strikes me as a cheap shot by the manufacturer, thus the 3 stars that I gave it. If it had those 2 items, it would have been 5 stars from me.", "My 32 year old Technics receiver silently passed away, so I needed a quick replacement. I had bought an inexpensive Sony 100 watt receiver as well as a Pioneer 100 watt receiver in the recent  past, and  I was not very pleased with either. They both  struggled with complex music and both eventually gave out after about a year. What can one expect for $100? I have owned many many stereo systems in my 54 years on this planet. In addition to the Technics, Pioneer and Sonys; I have owned Marantz,Yamaha, Nikko, Onkyo and Nakamichi.  The sound from this receiver is the best I ever owned as it is so so clean and effortless. Only the Nakamich is in the same league.The Yamaha goes from the quietest passages to extremely powerful music with total ease. It is a total pleasure to listen to. The instruments sound so clean. My old Bose 301, and  new BIC F12 subwoofers speakers sound new and awesome once I hooked this up to them. As for the radio, I am not a big FM user as I listen to radio via the internet. The FM however does seems excellent, but I did not play with it much. Just using the basic fm wire that came with the receiver worked quite well. I was so nicely surprised. With an antenna this should work exceptionally fine. I did not try the AM or Sirius feature. The knobs seem to require just the right amount of pressure to be turned. I find the box and layout refined and ---- attractive. The loudness knob works great, as it allows you to adjust the loudness to your taste and volume.To sum up, all is very good... with the super clean effortless strong sound.I did not give this unit 5 Stars because the first one I received from Amazon was Dead On Arrival. Quite upsetting for such an expensive unit. Amazon had another one at my house the next day while I shipped the first one back. Amazon service so far has always worked great for me. I paid $320 on Sept 10th, and I see that the price has already gone up $20. For the money this exceptional sounding receiver should last a long time (like my old Technics did), and I truly hope it will, as it really performs.", "I had to replace a very old receiver about a year ago.This model is just fantastic.I also bought the ipod adapter, which has been a complete joy.", "Seems like a great receiver. Quality seems great and it performs pretty well. Only issue is that I need to turn up the volume quite a bit to get the sound level that seems normal. But, that may be the way I have it connected OR it may be that I am powering my Klipsch 100 watt speakers with a 50 watt per channel amplifier? My sound is going to my TV via an HDMI cable, then out via the optical digital cable to an adapter and then to the Line 2 in at the receiver and then out to the speakers. Possibly also the sound setup on my TV needs to be changed? Have tried several options but still the same. Bottom line is that I am not sure if I should have purchased an amp with more output power, if my setup is not quite right or if the amp output is just weak? Suspect it is something I have done but not sure what? Like I mentioned at first the receiver/amp quality seems first rate just not sure about the performance?", "I&#34;ve owned yamaha receivers for over 12 years and this has to be the cheapest and worse sounding receiver yet put out by yamaha.", "The $499 price of this receiver represents good value.  The sound quality is on a par with that of the older Yamaha RX-495 receiver.  However, I have compared this receiver to the NAD C 356BEE integrated amplifier that costs $799, as well as to the Cambridge Audio Azur 350A integrated amplifier that was recently available at a close-out price of $299.  The sound quality of either of these amplifiers is better than that of the Yamaha R-S700 receiver.", "I needed a simple two channel receiver with a remote, FM, a few inputs for CD and Bluetooth and this does the job.  I live in a small condo with several neighbors so I don't need or want massive power.  Replaced an a/v receiver from 2000 or so.  I don't really do the home theater thing anymore, so no need for surround sound and all that.  Having two sets of speaker outputs is nice though -- after upgrading my speakers I wired the old set into another room.", "Writing this review after using this product for about three months. In this era of HT receivers, stereo amps/receivers have become rare species.  Point blank HT receivers are not for music. The Yamaha R-S700 is truly an outstanding stereo receiver. Yamaha's power ratings have always been extremely modest. The R-S700 does not sound like a 100W/channel receiver. Like the retro knobs!!....although they are made of plastic and not metal like in the amps from the 80s. Overall it looks tough and crude and thats exactly why I like the looks so much..........reminds me of the amps from the 80s. The unit is quite heavy. You get two remotes. One big remote for the main zone and another smaller one for zone 2. Both remotes look really cool. The receiver has a pre-amp out which may be used to connect an external amplifier. So your system may be upgraded anytime you want more power! The receiver in that case will work as a pre-amp. Also, the heat sinks in this unit are amaaaazing!!!! Even if you use it for a couple of hours the unit remains unbelievably cool.I also looked at integrated amps/stereo receivers from Harman Kardon, Denon, Marantz, NAD. Also, I was looking for something with at least 100Ws/channel. Harman's HK3490 and Denon's DRA-697CI scored way low on THD.....too high for my liking.  NADC375BEE, NADM2, NADM3(unbelieveably low THDs!!!!)are beyond my means at this time. Marantz-PM11S2 has a THD of 0.01% as opposed to Yamaha R-S700's 0.02% ....i.e., pretty much the same. The Marantz however costs $4000!!!!!.  So this Yamaha was the only choice.Using Yamaha's CDC600 CD player with Burr Brown 192kHz/24-bit DAC. Because of this DAC, this CD player pumps crystal clear sound to the receiver. So this CD player and the receiver make quite a pair:D! I am using Yamaha NS777 as my towers and JBL ES250P is my sub. Overall, this makes a pretty good system if not outstanding. The price at which this receiver (with such low THD) is currently selling for on Amazon is IMHO very very reasonable. If you have the means go for NAD otherwise get this baby. I am happy with it. Thanks for reading.", "I&#8217;m sorry to counter all the rave reviews, but seriously, someone needs to mention a few things about the R-S201. It&#8217;s an adequate stereo receiver. It&#8217;s not great and it&#8217;s barely good. The price is low, but (unfortunately) the performance really matches the price. The total harmonic distortion alone is unacceptably high - ridiculously high for a receiver by an ostensibly reliable brand like Yamaha. It plays loud, but it doesn&#8217;t play clean at high volume levels. There is a lack of unnecessary features, but this doesn&#8217;t mean the features that remain are better. Sometimes you get a really basic stereo receiver with no bells and whistles and the manufacturer has decided instead to concentrate on really good, pure sound. No such luck here. It&#8217;s just a basic receiver that performs adequately with a low price that is *almost* too high for what you get.This is usually the point when I would talk about cool features, but seriously, the R-S201 doesn&#8217;t have any! It has a headphone jack, it allows you to connect two pairs of speakers, it has a power saving feature, it has a remote control. This is like shopping for cars and having the deal brag about how the car has a steering wheel and doors.You might think I&#8217;m being unreasonable and writing from an unrealistic audiophile perspective. Perhaps this is partly true because, yes, this might actually be a serious upgrade for some buyers, but it&#8217;s also just me interpreting the specs and seeing their inferiority manifest in the sonic experience. The only way I could recommend this receiver is if you fall into one of two camps: 1) Maybe you&#8217;ve got one of those all-in-one systems from your dorm room, you&#8217;re now ready to put together a proper system, but you can&#8217;t afford to spend proper money on every element. In that case, the R-S201 will be a notable sonic improvement (although not more notable than other similarly priced models from other manufacturers). I&#8217;m practical. I realize that it&#8217;s tough to move beyond the all-in-one system since you basically have to buy all the parts at once (or at least speakers, a receiver, and a CD player or turntable).Or 2), Maybe you&#8217;re setting up a secondary system in some sort of less-than-ideal environment and you just need something cheap to drive some similarly crappy speakers. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a man cave setup in the garage, or maybe you need something to power outdoor speakers. In both cases, you&#8217;re already making such big sonic concessions that you won&#8217;t necessarily notice the shortcomings of the Yamaha. In that case, by all means, don&#8217;t waste your money on quality that you wouldn&#8217;t even be in a position to appreciate.But, if you can spend even a little bit more money and you&#8217;re wanting to do some real listening in an indoor setting, I&#8217;d highly recommend looking for something else. The Onkyo TX-SR313 sells for around $200, has a much better (and lower distortion) amplifier, plus an array of features that are actually pretty handy, like built-in USB connectivity. Or, if you really want to save money, then buy something even cheaper that is equally good, like the Sony STRDH130. It sells for around $115, has lower total harmonic distortion, and handles the same amount of power (ca. 100 watts per channel).Also, if you&#8217;re in the stages of building your first setup and the price appeals to you, I would caution you if you&#8217;re at all swayed by the power handling. Your receiver doesn&#8217;t need to handle a lot of power. 40-60 watts per channel is more than enough to make most speakers play very, very loud. Yes, the R-S201 can play louder than the R-S300, but the difference in the quality of amplification is remarkable. Once you turn the R-S201 up past its halfway point, the sound quality drops off considerably. If you&#8217;re looking for a first receiver, go for something with a lower power rating, but also lower distortion.As you can undoubtedly tell, I&#8217;m kind of offended that Yamaha would put its name on such a mediocre receiver. It&#8217;s too expensive to perform this poorly. However, beyond my disappointment in Yamaha, there is also the legitimate complaint that is evident from looking at the specifications. For virtually everyone, I&#8217;d recommend avoiding this.", "I bought the S500 receiver to put into a living room to drive a pair of bookshelf speakers in that room and a pair outside on my patio.  One thing that drew me to this receiver was the amount of physical knobs on the unit.  Many other stereo receivers in this price range force you to do most of the adjusting via a remote, which for me isn't ideal for what I wanted it for.Setup was easy and pretty much just was plugging everything in.  The power from the receiver is pretty good, but don't expect too much for this price point.  On the volume scale, between -20 to -30 dBs seems to be the sweet spot for driving a pair of 91dB sensitivity speakers (Def Tech AW5500).The remote is just okay...archaic looking but gets the job done.I'm going to connect an Apple AirPort Express unit to one of the RCA inputs this weekend so I can stream music from my iPad/iPhone to this receiver and control everything from the iPad/iPhone over AirPlay.  Stereo receivers that include AirPlay built in are at least $500, so if you are wanting that feature, consider an AirPort Express or AppleTV to achieve it.I have yet to run A/B pairs of speakers at the same time...my PSB Image 6 bookshelf speakers are coming next week.  If the receiver struggles to deliver power to both sets of speakers (indoor/outdoor) while both playing I'll update my review accordingly.UPDATE:I ran the indoor and outdoor speakers together for about 6 hours on Saturday and it handled them very well.  The Yamaha definitely ran hotter than just driving one pair of speakers but it never led to sound distortion or any overheating fuse trips.  Very satisfied!", "Firstly &#8211; I am NOT an audiophile. I can&#8217;t tell you about the subtleties of the clarity/pitch/etc.  What I CAN say is that this receiver does an EXCELLENT job at delivering what, to me, is a very clear, clean sound, and does it WAY better than the Sony receiver it replaced which was 3x the cost.  It was as easy to set up as any receiver, and its controls are similarly consistent / straightforward. I even find the radio to be above average &#8211; it&#8217;s very sensitive (almost too much so!).  I am quite impressed by this product.  It does everything it should, and it does it very well.  It&#8217;s also pretty stylish too &#8211; I have absolutely no qualms with the build of it; it&#8217;s &#8216;clean&#8217; and simple, and I like the brushed looked of it (I think that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called).  All in all, if someone were to ask me for a recommendation for an inexpensive but quality receiver, I would feel perfectly OK recommending this unit to them.  I&#8217;m very pleased with it.", "This is an old school stereo receiver that easily replaces and upgrades my older 1990's stereo. Powering two sets of two speakers each (for me one set is outside) this stereo provides a very rich and well balanced sound. I've tried several alternatives but this is the only one that provided the natural sound I was looking for. I added the Yamaha IPOD attachment and could not be happier."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0004269263008609414, 0.000885230430867523, 0.0027292720042169094, 0.0001385578652843833, 0.3232475817203522, 0.0013503998052328825, 0.0001195180811919272, 0.40442225337028503, 0.06191680580377579, 0.005097940098494291, 0.0011667844373732805, 0.0002874078636523336, 0.004212693311274052, 0.19049717485904694, 0.00030070877983234823, 0.001712318044155836, 0.0005956507520750165, 0.0008927696035243571]]}
