She loves them.  They stay in her ears and the quality seems good.  Only down side is that it is difficult to carry these in a  back pack or bag so she still uses her other set sometimes but she prefers these.  Now getting another set for myself.\"", "I was jogging along listening to music. The beat was pounding. The music got over, the beat kept pounding. It was my footsteps. These Neckband Earbuds are very sensitive to movement and will pick up any and all vibrations. That's the down side. On the plus side, they are extremely comfortable, fit very well and have decent sound quality.", "These headphones are lightweight and fit well. I use these when running. I don't even notice they are there, and they block out external noise.", "I bought these for my husband and myself to share when one of us needs headphones.  As with anything, there are pros and cons.Pros:Nice and lightweight.Very comfortable in the ears. I have the Motorola Bluetooth behind-the-ears headphones, and they are extremely uncomfortable.Love the color combination.Cons:Sound quality isn't very good.  Not much bass, and I like my bass.Not adjustable. The headphones fit great on me, but not my husband, and he doesn't have a huge head.Bottom line, they're OK, but nothing to get really excited about. I'm keeping them because the price was right (Gold Box special), and because I need some comfortable headphones.  Guess I'll have to keep looking for some for my husband.", "I never realized how much I hated having two cords dangle from my head while in the gym until I bought this product.  I can never go back to two cords again.", "\"I'll be honest i haven't owned a lot of different headphones. If i'm listening to music on a plane or working on something at home without wanting to disturb my wife i have a nice set of over the ear headphones. For running i had just always sort of been content with the occasional readjustment i would have to make using the iPhone earbuds. Once i ramped up my running to 3, 4, 5 miles, i finally had enough of them and looked for an alternative. It was a spur of the moment purchase after i ran a 5K and was extra frustrated with the white earbuds, so far i'm not disappointed.The comparison from these to the apple ear buds isn't even a contest. It's like me going up against michael jordan in a one on one basketball game. The comparison isn't even fair, but it's all i have to go on so most of this review is keeping that in mind.The first time i put these on i was instantly relieved at the weight and the comfort of the earbuds. No more heavy \"\"non tangle\"\" cord that bounced enough to eventually pull the earbuds out of my ears. No more adjusting them as they wiggle their way out of my ears around a mile into my run, and the sound was much better, mainly because they weren't resting on the outside of my ear and actually in my ear canal. Sufficient bass without sounding like it's a \"\"fake\"\" bass. The headphones get perfectly loud for me, but i can turn them all the way up and it's still not super loud, i could see some people maybe complaining about that, but non issue for me.The fact that the cord only comes out of one side of the headphones is a plus for me as well. It exits behind your left ear and i always run the cable down my shirt into my pocket where my phone is. It works perfectly and keeps the cord from bouncing around on your face. The cord is a tad longer than the ear buds which was better for me since i like to run with my phone in my pocket and not on my arm. I can't comment on if the cord would be annoying to someone that would have the phone closer to the headphones. They do come with a clip which i could see using if you had a lot of cord left over.The only con i can really come up with for these headphones is something that has been mentioned in other reviews, but i don't think it's a flaw with the headphones. They fit so well into my ears that they actually block out most of the ambient sound just from the secure fit. Since that is the case you do hear \"\"thumping\"\" which is going to happen anytime you seal your ear off. If you put your fingers in your ears to block sound out and jump and move around there is going to be a bit of a \"\"thud\"\" since you are blocking your ear canal. It's not any sound coming through the headphones like some people are saying. if you stand perfectly still and fumble with the cord you can't hear anything. I chose the smaller of the ear pieces and it made it much better, but wasn't a big deal to me to begin with. Once i turn my music up (i might like to run with music a little louder than most, not sure) you can't hear it even with the bigger ear pieces in.All in all these are incredible in comparison to what i was dealing with all along with the god awful ear buds that come with your iphone. Much lighter, much more comfortable (and i have a big head, i wear a 7 1/2 - 7 3/4 fitted baseball cap) and the sound quality is much better (although, like i mentioned, i think it's just because they are where they should be in your ear canal. If you press the apple earbuds into your ear where these are, they sound comparable).For the price that you can get these online i would certainly recommend them. I have run probably a dozen times with them now and there is no way i would ever go back.\"", "\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Initial post: Product was DOA - Left ear dead. Aug 2011-----------------------------------------------------------------------------I was EXCITED to get these... to replace the countless other brands I have had.CONS:1- The left earpiece was Dead-On-Arrival - I returned the unit for replacement. Will update soon.2- Cable off the left ear...  I guess this would be ok if I had a left arm band... but I run with a small pouch on the back of my waist.  I like the ones that run off the middle of the back.  Easy enough to \"\"fix\"\"  - I just can tie a small loop so it comes down the back.  It is still long enough.PROS:1- The fit is great.  They sit nicely on the ears.2 - Really can't review the rest until I get a working unit.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated Post: Dec 2011-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Amazon quickly replaced the DOA pair with new ones.  They are working great!PROS:1) The fit is great!  I love running with them.  I forget they are even on.  I love the single cable to one side.  Just wish it was off the other ear... but big deal.. it runs down my back to the other side into my running belt to the iphone4.  They also stay in the ears and the feel of the buds is excellent.2) The sound is great!  They sound perfect.  I can still hear traffic coming up behind me.3) Durable - I have dropped my iphone and caught it by the cord.  Holding strong.4) Price is great.  I got them on the deal of the day for ~$15CONS:1) I mentioned the DOA - but that was resolved by Amazon without issue.2) I mentioned the cord off to the left... but I like right... but that is preference. Now that I think about it... the cord would be too long if down to the right so this is OK.Bottom line...These are great and you should seriously consider them.  I added a small add-on to the bottom to give me iPhone Volume control/skip/play.  I just wish these had it built in... but for the price it these rock!\"", "I had others headphones for run, but this is amazing, the sweat doesn't go inside your ear.It fits very well on your ears and the sound is good.", "These Philips neckband headphones sound very good compared to others. The only negative is that they really dig into your ear to give you the full sound. I have to use the smallest buds for my ears. I really don't think they can make the perfect earbuds for one reason or another. But, the kind like these are about the best you can get. I am more comfortable wearing the smaller Sony MDR-G45 headphones that cover your ears, except they are a little too hot for the summer.", "I have something I would like to admit with you all...I have a headphone fetish.Well...not really, but I have this compulsion of purchasing tons of headphones in search for the perfect sound and comfort by the way....there is no such thing....but these are pretty close in the comfort department.I would state that I could wear these for hours, but I'd be lying. I could wear these things for DAYS.They barely feel as though that are on my head, over my ear and in my ear.The sound is OK. they seem to bleed a bit to the outside world, but to be honest, you don't really need to play them that loud.Prior to these, I was usingJVC HA-FX35-B Soft Marshmallow Stereo Headphones (Black)when I am at work. Those are comfortable too, but still not even close to these. The JVC's you have to push in your ear pretty good so that they don't fall out which will eventually happen after moving you head here and there. You wont run into this problem with the Action Fit because they are over your ears. This also means they don't have to be crammed far into you ear canals like the JVC's or even theUltimate Ears TripleFi 10 Noise Isolating Earphoneswhich I own as well (by the way...incase you were wondering....the Ultimate Ears are the most UNCOMFORTABLE buds EVER!). So go on wit cho bad self and whip your hair back and forth!For gym use I use myMotorola S9-HD Bluetooth MOTOROKR/MOTOACTIV Stereo Headset (Gloss Black) [Retail Packaging] which aren't as comfortable as the Action Fit, but it beats having a wire dangling around while I am working out.I got these headphones during a lightning deal for 9 bucks with the inclusion of $2 towards an Amazon MP3 purchase.But I would have paid full price for these if I knew how comfortable they were.And I love the fact that there is only one coming down from the buds instead of 2. This helps keep from tangles which I have not had a problem with so to speak.These are now my favorite headphones, especially at work which I have to block out 8 hours worth of printer noise.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "These were an Amazon lightning deal so the price was quite cheap so I ordered them to try them out.  I figured I'd try using them while cycling when I listen to (talk) podcasts.  They fit fine and comfortably so I have no complaints there.  Also the wind across the earphones isn't a problem like they are with my earbuds which give me a lot of wind nose due to aerodynamics.So my complaint is not with the design.  They are lightweight, comfortable, and fit surprisingly well.The sound quality kind of sucks.  They are very anemic on the low and high end, just solid mid range.  I didn't expect great quality, but even worse than my low expectations.  They resemble the quality of some cheap $1 earbuds you might find in a random bin at a flea market.  Even for talk-only podcasts which you would think you'd want mostly just mids, after 10 minutes I pulled them out, put in my earbuds, and never went back.  For music, don't bother.Sony makes some very good quality earbuds that MSRP for $40 (and can often be found at 50%-75% of that price on Amazon) that have relatively solid dynamic audio quality that I'm very happy with.I though I'd try this design as I was hoping the cord and fit would work better for my activity, and in fact it does.  But I was so displeased by the sound quality I'm not going to bother using them.They just weren't even worth the $14 (lightning deal) I paid for them let alone the $25 standard price they go for.I shouldn't be surprised.  I have had a pair of Philips earbuds that I thought sounded good at all.Save your money, get something decent."], "Gamma": [0.14876000583171844, 0.14878611266613007, 0.14876000583171844, 0.5536938905715942], "Beta": [[0.11027028411626816, 0.17600780725479126, 0.10102144628763199, 0.017072271555662155, 0.028023982420563698, 0.04062747582793236, 0.00011837967758765444, 0.16980920732021332, 0.14939740300178528, 0.20564283430576324, 0.002008869545534253], [0.11026991903781891, 0.17600812017917633, 0.10102072358131409, 0.017071936279535294, 0.02802351675927639, 0.04062802717089653, 0.00011836511839646846, 0.16980904340744019, 0.14939795434474945, 0.20564381778240204, 0.00200863229110837], [0.11027028411626816, 0.17600780725479126, 0.10102144628763199, 0.017072271555662155, 0.028023982420563698, 0.04062747582793236, 0.00011837967758765444, 0.16980920732021332, 0.14939740300178528, 0.20564283430576324, 0.002008869545534253], [0.10603688657283783, 0.1783798485994339, 0.093357615172863, 0.01375492475926876, 0.023396464064717293, 0.04672140255570412, 3.203035521437414e-05, 0.1676470786333084, 0.1547228842973709, 0.21538196504116058, 0.0005688562523573637]]}
