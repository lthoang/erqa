"], "reviews": ["\"When I first opened the Amazon box to reveal the Play-do Twirl N Top Pizza Shop, by 4 year old son's eyes lit up and he was incredibly excited.  We sat down together to open the box and dig out all the fun pieces to the set, as well as the play-doh it contained.  We both had so much fun playing together and my son was amazed and loved the way it was so easy to make pizza crust.  Playing with the different molds for the pizza topping is tons of fun and I have to say - this is a HUGE plus for me - the play-doh easily removes from the twister \"\"cheese grater\"\"!  I have had several of these play-doh sets throughout my 9 years as a parent and even though many of them are very cool and fun, any of them that are required to be filled with play-doh to create, was a massive pain and headache to dig the play-doh out of after play was finished.  You cannot imagine how excited and delighted I was when I discovered this was not even remotely an issue with this set.My 9 year old daughter even has fun playing with this set.  I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this set.  It is very compact and would be easy to toss in a big ziplock bag to take along on trips (no not to play in the car, but at motels, or friends' houses)  It is simple, fun and easy to use.  The play-doh that is included is the perfect amount to make yummy looking pizzas and make perfect pretend play an awesome time!\"", "I requested this toy for my seven year-old daughter.  She immediately took to it and starting making play-doh pizza for daddy!  The toy is easy to use - my daughter figured it all out on her own, and the play doh colors were smartly selected for the various pizza products - tan for the pizza dough and green, white and red for your toppings.  Made of durable and colorful plastic, the toy is sure to last a good while. The only minor drawbakc is that your child needs to be careful to not mix the colors.  This, however, is the learning part.", "\"My niece and two nephews had a sleepover one night and I brought this out for them to enjoy. It was kind of hard to figure who would do what-it's really good for 1 to 2 kids at a time only-but they did enjoy playing with it for a little while. My 8 year old niece did the cheese grating but even she required a little help in pushing the dough down and spinning it to make the \"\"cheese\"\". My one 5 year old nephew rolled the dough to make the pizza dough part and my other nephew put the dough in the shape molds for the toppings. They did have fun while making it but once the \"\"pizza\"\" was done and everyone had their pretend slice of pizza, the kids were pretty much done with the pizza set.For me, the one drawback of the set is that it is really hard to keep the colors seperated. I've always been one of those types who believes that Play-Doh should never be mixed but with this set, it's pretty hard to keep that rule. And even though kids like the idea of mixing the colors, they seem to lose interest pretty fast in the Play-Doh that is a mixture of two or more colors. So the pizza set is fun but I think that there might be other Play-Doh sets that would be more fun and kids stay interested longer than this one.\"", "Another great Playdoh toy. Gave as a gift to a 5 yr old girl and it was the first present she wanted to open and play with. Doh colors are food-like and the machinery works as you'd expect it to. Hours of enjoyment.", "This is pretty similar to some other Play-doh kitchen sets, both in terms of strengths and weaknesses.  (For example, compare thePlay-Doh Magic Swirl Ice Cream Shoppeor thePlay-doh Burger Builder).Strengths: Like the other sets, this is a lot of fun for kids who like Play-doh and cooking.  It has a press that you can use to make pizza crusts, a grater for cheese, and a set of smaller molds for a variety of toppings.  My five year old loves it, and loves taking pizza orders, then making a pizza to share with her dad or her stuffed animals.Weaknesses:  Younger kids, especially 3 or under, may have trouble manipulating the set.  Also, as the other reviewers have pointed out, pretty soon your Play-doh colors will get mushed together, producing a bunch of cans of mottled brown and mottled green.  If your kids like getting color appropriate pizzas, each set of dough doesn't have much staying power.", "\"Honestly, my daughter is somewhat below the age range for this toy, but I selected it because she is enthralled by the idea of making food and I thought it was an activity we could do together.  I have been thoroughly impressed with the value, the construction, and the ease of use of this set.  The set comes with everything to make \"\"pizzas\"\" as depicted on the box (honestly they could have included bigger containers of play-doh, but it's sufficient).  The construction is much more durable than I remember it and my daughter has had a blast playing with the set without the play-doh.  The \"\"pizza oven\"\" and the \"\"cheese grater\"\" have been dropped, kicked, submersed, and left all over the house with no damage.  We have had a great time using the set to actually play with play-doh and I didn't find it too difficult to make the \"\"pizzas\"\" as they're shown on the box.  Clean up is easy and there are very few places that can get gunked up with dry play-doh.\"", "This set allows kids to make pizzas and toppings out of play doh.  It includes 4 cans of playdoh, a pizza maker, and various toppings shaped molds.  My kids, ages 6 and 4, played with this for hours.  They enjoyed making pizzas for everyone.  After the included play doh is finished, any play doh can be used as a refill.  This set was also easy to use.  Like all play doh products, it is great for creativity.  The main downside is the mess.  Play doh really sticks to carpet so try to cover the floor of the play area so it doesn't get ground in (tip: let it dry completely and then vacuum it).  This toy certainly is classic fun.  My kids are a bit bigger, but I imagine that some kids may be tempted to eat their creations.  Luckily play doh is non-toxic.", "My son has a bunch of Play-doh toys, so this just adds to his collection. Whenever we get all the Play-doh stuff out for him (usually once a week), he loves it. This toy proved to be a big hit! It came with a few small color containers and one large tan container for the 'dough', but we have a big box of Play-doh in the garage, so he plays with a bunch of different colors. After showing him how to use it, he got right to making pizza's! Taking the 'cheese' grater on and off proves to be a little challenging at times, but for the most part, he picked it up right away.I think if you were to give this toy to a child (especially an older child) all by itself it would lose it's fun factor pretty quickly. My son's using it with other Play-doh equipment though, so he's enjoyed it every time he plays with it. This would be a great gift idea for younger kids since they can start making pizza's right out of the box!", "\"I have never been a fan of play doh - but my kids love it, so when they got the Play-doh Twirl N Top Pizza Shop they were thrilled.The Twirl N Top Pizza Shop has provided my 6 and 4 year old boys hours of fun.  They work together in the shop and make pizza's for everyone who comes over.  The \"\"crust\"\" gets pressed down in the \"\"oven\"\" by the handle on top.  Then you put the dough under the \"\"cheese shredder\"\" and twirl the handle to make little pieces of cheese come out (a little tricky for them to operate at first, but then they got the hang of holding it down while turning the handle)  Then you make your toppings on the topping mold - peppers, pepperoni, mushroom, anchovies... lots to choose from!  Then you can use the little pizza cutter, slice it up, then use the server to serve it to your 'customers'I wish the topping molds were a little easier to release the molded toppings after you press dough in (maybe I am doing something wrong?)  But you press the dough in and then you have to dig it out and by the time you get it back out you no longer have the perfect shape.It comes with all the parts and all the dough (which is fantastic!)  A large brown dough container so you can make several crusts and then 3 small containers (one each of red, green and white)  A great buy for the price!\"", "\"What kid doesn't like Play-Doh? This is a pretty cool (and reasonably well-constructed) Play-Doh play set that lets kids pretend they are making their own pizza. With four [appropriately] different colors of Play-Doh, kids can make the \"\"dough,\"\" the \"\"sauce,\"\" and the different toppings for their own pizza.While not my kids' favorite Play-Doh apparatus, this one is still fun and ia a great creative play toy for youngsters.\"", "My 3 and  year old was very eager to play with this when it arrived - she is very familiar with Play Doh and we have lots of other molds and tools to use already.  The concept of letting them make their own pizza is very cute and fun, however some of the tools and molds with this set are a little difficult for a 3 year old (and even myself) to master.The device that sprinkles the cheese requires the attachment of a crank-handle on the top - this is not something my daughter was able to do on her own.  After she would push the Play Doh down into the device I would attach the handle for her and then she was able to turn the crank to make the cheese come out.Also the tiny molds they give you for the toppings are just that - TINY, and thus very hard to get the Play Doh out of the mold once you have it in there.  We used the tines of a small plastic fork to pry the molded pieces out afterwards - I think they need to devise a better way to mold shapes, at least a way that little kids can do it on their own.Overall it was fun, my daughter enjoyed creating her own pretend pizza and it kept her busy for quite some time.  With a little adult supervision I think this if fine for ages 3 and up.", "Since both of my children, aged 8 and 2, were able to play with this for a good half hour w/o fighting, I'd rate it a top toy. It comes with 3 small cans of Play doh and one larger one which is pizza crust colored. The crust is easy to make. The cheese is a lil difficult and my youngest got very frustrated with it. Her sister quickly took over this task. My kids also had a hard time getting the toppings out of their mold but then had fun rolling their own toppings. They do love pretending to cook and playing mommy so they loved serving us up pizza. Its Play Doh. It's definitely messy but it's fun.", "As soon as it was delivered, my two young boys, ages 2 & 5, tore open the box and started their first of many half hour to 45-mins playtime sessons with the pizza shop. They never cared that the dough became mixed up or that what is supposed to be a meatball was a green and redish glob that would soon turn into just brown. the only thing they knew was Fun - and that the cheese grater can seperate from the oven so both could properly take turns and continue their imaginative play. I was pleastly surprised with the size and durablility. It has been knocked off the table and stepped upon, smacked and kicked, yet no scratches are visible. Yeah, if you want to keep a pizza looking like a pizza, then you may want to have a bunch of extra colors lying around because once the product is used, unless an adult is sitting there and taking off the layers with each topping (what is the fun in that) then the colors will conjoin in one big pile of brown.When they got tired of the brown, I went to get neon colors and we had a monster/ alien pizza party. That mixure actually became a real hit that we continue to use.The only diffucult thing for my youngest was being able to put the correct amount of dough on the plate for the oven press. If there is too much on the plate, it does not fit inside and if there is too little, you only get a half mold when the level handle is pressed. He also needed help with turning the cheese grater due to the amount of playdoh in the container (for him I had to use less than an inch ball of playdoh) The 12 topping molds are also present on top of the oven and are half shaped, and a little hard to hand for the younger hands.All in all, I think this is a great addition to the playdoh sets. Fun for friends, fun for sublings, and a perfect boredom buster for that last minute family visit or vacation.", "I have a 3 year old who has recently become a huge Play-doh fan, needless to say when I was offered to review this item I didn't think it twice. We just received it yesterday and he has not stopped playing with it!What's in the box? A small oven, a cheese sprinkler (one of those you have to put together first), dishes, molds and 4 cans of Play-doh (1 five-ounce and 3 two-ounce cans)As the name indicates, the idea of this set is to have the kids make Play-doh pizzas with the set and materials included, while the box is supposed to include everything you need, my little one ended up using Play-doh cans he already had, as apparently for him, not enough Play-doh was included. I can't really complain as the price of the set seems right (compared to other sets we have gotten for him) and the Play-doh cans aren't that expensive should you need extra ones.The thing I like of these types of sets is they stimulate the kid's imagination and allow them to create things, my kid still has thePlay-Doh: Fun Factory Super Setwe gave him last Christmas and he still seems to enjoy playing with it. This new set comes to complement it with more activities he can now perform.", "\"I got the Play-Doh Twirl N' Top Pizza Shop for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She loves Play-Doh and has several different sets including the Play-Doh Refrigerator, which makes a nice companion piece to the pizza set I am reviewing.  The \"\"oven\"\" makes the crust by pressing down on the handle, the top has molds for all the toppings including the standard pepperoni, mushrooms and meatballs but also has shrimp and pineapple among many others.  You can make a standard pie or let your imagination run wild.  For pareyou move the crust over to the cheese topper, turn the crank and the pizza pan spins while topping your pizza with cheese!  This set comes with a large light brown dough for the crust, 1 small white dough for cheese and small red and green for toppings.  It has a pizza cutter and a spatula for serving.For parents, this set is easy to clean compared to other sets where dough gets caught in the mechanics of the toy.All in all a great set that my granddaughter loves to play with!  Way To Go, Play-Doh!\"", "\"My four sons were thrilled to see this set when it arrived on our doorstep. They love play-doh and play with it often. My oldest son (age 9) was able to put it together without my help and there was enough play-doh provided for each boy to have a \"\"job\"\" to do. They really enjoyed shaping the dough, putting it in the press, sprinkling the cheese, and making the toppings. It kept them entertained for about an hour, and there were extras included that can be used for more open-ended play, such as the pizza cutter, the serving knife, and the mold for the toppings.The problem with this set, and with any set that is themed (such as thePlay-Doh Magic Swirl Ice Cream Shoppe), is that it really only functions as intended the very first time you play with it. ONce the colors get mixed, the pizzas are no longer colorful, they are all muddy brown. That is to be expected, but it's also why I typically don't buy these type of sets unless I need it for a specific task, such as entertaining kids during an event. If you only have one child who is very careful to pick the pizza back apart to keep the colors separate, you would probably get more use out of it.I do like that this set is not as big and bulky as the ice-cream shop, so we were able to fit it all in a tupperware box with a lid. It won't be very hard to store.In my opinion, the play-doh sets with lots of molds and cutting tools, such as thePlay-Doh: Fun Factory Deluxe Set, are the ones with lasting value because they allow them to use their imagination to the fullest and don't require many different colors to enjoy. This is a fun one-time toy.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06159864366054535, 0.05882624536752701, 0.05781678482890129, 0.061851486563682556, 0.0653594434261322, 0.06455469131469727, 0.053745705634355545, 0.06608940660953522, 0.06426102668046951, 0.06468476355075836, 0.06818819791078568, 0.063796266913414, 0.07128936052322388, 0.06575007736682892, 0.05639656260609627, 0.05579134076833725]]}
