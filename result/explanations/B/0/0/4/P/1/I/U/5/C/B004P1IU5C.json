The most used I give this mouse it's to play my favorite online fps, Combat Arms.  The reason why I got this mouse was for it's size. I used to have a small blue tooth mouse but it kept getting disconnected then, I had a Microsoft mouse which was great but it was smaller, which cause my hand to hurt after prolong used. After I got this mouse the discomfort is lower then the previous corded or wireless  mice.The mouse has a preset setting in the middle button to increase the speed of the cursor. and a forward and backward button for your browsing needs.  All in all I recommend this mouse.", "This mouse fits in my hand in such a way that my hand, wrist, and forearm are just more relaxed than they are with other mice.I like the side buttons that you can click for forward or back in either browsers or windows.I like that the scroll button has middle button.I like that there is a second button below the scroll button where you can quickly select the pointer speed alternatively between 600 dpi, 1200 dpi, 1800 dpi, and 2400 dpi.  The high definition optical sensor will adjust up to 2400 dpi for precision.The mouse cord ends in a USB plug but included in this amazon package is an adapter that you can place into the USB so that you can plug this mouse into PS2 if you want to do so.The optical works great on every surface that I have tried including bedspread, carpet, wood, etc.While most of this mouse is slick and sculpted for comfortable grip to user's hand, the area under the thumb is a soft rubber cushion with easy-grip finish.  My ring finger is supported by the shape as well.I think the response on this mouse is perfect.  You don't have to push your finger far to get the click but it doesn't click when you are just re-positioning the mouse somewhere.I recommend this mouse because I like it.  It is my first Kensington product I believe and would feel comfortable purchasing more of their products.I think you might like this Kensington ProFit Mouse too; but only if you are right-handed.", "As my wife & daughters like to say, I have a large palm but smaller fingers. 7.5&#34; from tip of middle to bottom of palm, but my fingers are 3&#34; long. (My preteen daughter measured both as she thought it was funny we had nearly the same size finger).  I've used regular mice for years, just bought this, and instantly said &#34;oh thats nice&#34;.Buttons are in a nice position too, no accidental clicks.", "Has three sensitivity settings, fits in your hand nice, and is cheap. Cause mice shouldn't be $100. AND it has a forward and back button on the side for your thumb - great for lazy people like me who go on Stumbleupon way too much. Plug N Play too, although I don't know many devices not set that way...", "I bought this mouse to replace a mid-size non-ergo office mouse.  The old one I had to use a sort of pincer grip on it with my thumb and ring finger, and it was hurting my hands. I didn't care for the shape of it.  This Kensington is slightly larger and has a big back-swell that nicely fills the palm of your hand.  And no, I don't have really big hands =)I am happy I got it and especially like how you can change the mouse pointer tracking speed instantly by clicking the small center button.  The button is placed so it is not likely to be accidentally touched once you find a setting you like.  Same with the Forward/Back buttons on the side, I was nervous about them because they are placed so close to the thumb, but I have not found myself accidentally pressing them.This was my first ergonomic mouse and think it is a really good value for the price.  I plan to replace my home desktop mouse with one of these very soon.(I attached pics above for comparison)", "The wireless version of this mouse felt a little laggy on my Macbook Pro, so I bought the one with a cable. It still feels fairly laggy compared to another USB mouse I have, but perhaps the responsiveness is tuned differently.That said, this was the most affordable mouse I could find to fit my hand. I've decided my hand is worth the it, so I kept it, and after getting used to the slight &#34;lag&#34; I haven't really had a problem.", "I love this mouse... I work a lot at my computer and I always struggled to find a mouse to fits me well... what I mean by that, is that most mouses I used in the past are too small for my hands, which means that my pinky and ring fingers end up dragging on the side and after a whole day of working at the computer that hurts my hand. Not with this mouse... I now can rest all my fingers on it and the pain is gone... it is a big mouse though... so if you have small hands it wont fit you. Like my wife for example. She doesnt like using it cuz she has problems reaching the buttons or scroll wheel with her fingers. Overall the product is solid, and has been working fine sine I started using it a month ago. I even dropped it a few times but nothing broke and works great. Lets hope it stays that way!", "If you're looking for a large mouse this is it. The only bad thing is my fingers want to not line up with the buttons. When you grab the sides of the mouse it wants to pull to the left not center.", "Best mouse I've ever had. Have purchased several for my small business.I love the way they fit my rather large hand (long fingers)."], "Gamma": [8.165664621628821e-05, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.07346716523170471, 0.060516417026519775, 0.06027956306934357, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.060516417026519775, 0.06070555001497269, 0.060516417026519775, 0.06051502749323845, 0.07927045226097107], "Beta": [[0.16274307668209076, 0.09500850737094879, 0.017237866297364235, 0.10480427742004395, 0.0747997835278511, 0.05160128325223923, 0.015681806951761246, 0.1456369310617447, 0.16560661792755127, 0.1668798327445984], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17140038311481476, 0.08319208025932312, 0.005301326513290405, 0.10513615608215332, 0.07574659585952759, 0.03296763822436333, 0.01383777055889368, 0.15596504509449005, 0.1782347857952118, 0.17821821570396423], [0.17143617570400238, 0.08388952910900116, 0.005517582409083843, 0.10470759123563766, 0.07490311563014984, 0.033860232681035995, 0.01353160198777914, 0.15588633716106415, 0.17814958095550537, 0.1781182885169983], [0.1639728844165802, 0.08364689350128174, 0.0053190491162240505, 0.10969963669776917, 0.08617079257965088, 0.03270893916487694, 0.020541610196232796, 0.15383772552013397, 0.17209605872631073, 0.17200641334056854], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17125684022903442, 0.08388437330722809, 0.005506802350282669, 0.10483590513467789, 0.0751732587814331, 0.033826470375061035, 0.013673755340278149, 0.1558472365140915, 0.17801445722579956, 0.1779809296131134], [0.17143614590168, 0.08388955146074295, 0.005517585668712854, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490310072898865, 0.03386024385690689, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588630735874176, 0.17814955115318298, 0.1781182587146759], [0.1714361608028412, 0.08388959616422653, 0.005517604295164347, 0.10470757633447647, 0.07490309327840805, 0.03386029601097107, 0.013531597331166267, 0.15588627755641937, 0.1781495213508606, 0.1781182587146759], [0.17154976725578308, 0.08290977776050568, 0.005223561078310013, 0.10519350320100784, 0.07584425806999207, 0.032635632902383804, 0.013831794261932373, 0.15603244304656982, 0.17839378118515015, 0.1783854067325592]]}
