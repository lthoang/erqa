I wear my hair naturally curly, I used this flatiron and it really straightened my hair looks like I have a perm! loved it..I try not to apply alot of heat to my hair, so I will use on very occasions, saves money going to a salon", "This iron is rather pricey.  I expected it to do an exceptional job straightening my hair since it was more expensive than most of the irons I have used but it certainly did not. Additionally, I had some concerns about having to reach into the inside of the wand to manipulate the temperature wheel and power switch; that is simply a burn waiting to happen. I much prefer my other irons to this one! I think the only positive I can add is that it is lightwieght.  I definitely recommend that you look elsewhere.  You can get a better product for much less money.", "All the pluses first. This iron is really cool looking. I love the outside sparkle and the turn nob and light on the inside are great features. The white plates (the part that gets hot) is a cool feature but I worry over time it will look really dirty. It heats very quickly and even has a blinking light to tell you when it is up to heat. It has a dial to turn up and down the heat. It is very light weight! I hate how heavy irons can get. I feel like I am lifting weights as I do my hair first with the blow dryer then the iron I am exhausted after I do all my daughters hair.Ahhh the negative:{ So It works well as long as you use small sections of hair and go slow. I just bought a professional flat iron that works amazing! If you want the name leave a comment below. I feel bad but I had to compare the two right off and this one just did not stand up to the test. In my opinion this would be one of the best flat irons you could buy at Walmart. But I don't think a salon owner or a beautician would use it.", "\"To begin, I don't understand why most flat irons are marketed as \"\"straighteners\"\" because they do NO such thing. If your hair is wavy, it simply flattens the curl that is there--it doesn't remove it. You really have to straighten your hair first, THEN use this to simply smooth it out. So go into my review knowing that I already don't think any of this type of product literally straightens hair. I also don't have a lot of experience with flat irons, but the one I used most in the past both straightened AND flattened (the larger version of theMaxius Miniglide On The Go Flat Ironthat has teeth to pull the curl out), so I'm a bit spoiled.This flat iron is meh at best.1. It's super small compared to what I'm used to--almost what I imagine what a travel iron would be.2. It tips over really easily--the rubber feet on either side pretty much do nothing to keep it from sliding around.3. It really doesn't get hot. I have thick coarse hair so I automatically use the highest heat setting...and even on that setting, it didn't get my hair untouchable hot. (Yeah, untouchable hot isn't very healthy, but I put stuff in my hair to help with that AND I've had other irons (professional and not) that I couldn't touch my hair immediately afterward because it was just too hot.) After multiple repeated passes with this iron, it was warm, but far from being untouchable.4. It doesn't straighten. After blow-drying, I noticed a small section of my hair that was still wavy, so even though I knew what WOULDN'T happen, just for giggles I ran the iron over that section about 10 times and big surprise--it was still wavy.So overall it didn't seem to do much of anything to my hair and seemed really small and tippy. I would be disappointed if I paid full price for this item.\"", "\"I'll never understand why the \"\"better\"\" straighteners cost so much more than the \"\"average\"\" ones. This expensive hair straightener did what was expected and nothing more. I actually found that I prefer using ones in the thirty to fifty range. I had to set the heat setting much higher than with the cheaper ones to get the same pin-straight effect, which subjected my hair to a lot more damage than when using the cheaper ones. My hair was straight in the end, but I fail to see the benefit of using something so expensive.\"", "I tried this product the other morning.  I was in a rush and the top of my hair was doing its own thing--sticking out sideways and flat and in no shape.  I heated this up in about a minute, sectioned off my hair.  Clamped my WET hair on it and twirled it around, and POOF! I had instant curl and body.  I was very impressed.  It was so quick and so effective. I have not tried it yet to make straight hair but I have no doubt it will work wonderfully.  It has a dial to crank up the heat if you like.  The light shows you when it's hot (it took maybe a minute).BTW-The product is 9 1/2 inches long.  Add another 2 inches for the connection before the wire bends, so if you want to buy a case to carry/house the product, get one about 12 inches long.  It does not come with a case.", "I have very thin hair- Setting this flat iron to 300 is the perfect setting for my hair- It straightens within seconds... I really feel like it makes my hair soft, not frizzy and very easy to use!  The perfect straightener for my hair!", "I was a little skeptical when ordering the T3 Micro Luminous 1 inch Flat Iron, not sure it if was going to live up to its cost. I have to say when I received it, I was quite impressed. It comes in a nice box, lined with royal colored velvet, which would make a great gift. The iron itself is smooth and light weight. Though the temperature gage is in kind of an awkward place, a little hard to read, it's a wonderful feature. The different temperature settings allow you to select the degree of heat you want to subject your hair too. The on and off switch is convenient. It comes with a nice, long cord, but what I love about it the most is that it swivels with great smoothness. Your hair will glide through the heating plates with ease. My hair, very thin, straightened effortlessly. The end result was straight, silky looking hair.Product Features* Max 450 degrees fahrenheit* 1 inch tourmaline plates* 9 feet Swivel cord* Free heat resistant mat", "I haven't used a flat iron in a few years.  Once my hair got longer, I started using a large barrel marcel curling iron to straighten my hair.  I did this because the flat irons I had would snag some hair and I was having problems with breakage.A few years ago I had purchased two T3 marcel curling irons to keep at my mom's house so that I wouldn't have to pack mine every time I went to visit. I found them on sale for cheaper than my usual brand, so I figured they would be okay to use occasionally.  Turns out that I absolutely LOVED the T3 curling irons and ended up keeping them at my house to use daily and took my regular irons to my mom's house.I recently got my hair cut to a little below my shoulders.  It has layers in it, so I really needed to go back to a flat iron to be able to straighten it properly because of the length.  I was very anxious to try the T3 flat iron.  It did not disappoint me!!!  It is simple to use (then again, pretty much all flat irons are simple to use).  It also heats up VERY quickly.  So far I haven't had any hair get caught or snag in the flat iron.  I do run the iron somewhat slowly down my hair so that it does straighten on the first pass.  All in all, I am EXTREMELY happy with my T3 flat iron!!!!", "This flat iron does what it is supposed to do - it straightens your hair. It does a good job, but there is nothing amazing about it. It performs just as good as any other flat iron in the $30-40 range. The T3 doesn't have any qualities or abilities that would make it worth the extra money when compared to other irons.It does glide smoothly, but I get that same performance from other irons as well. I have several flat irons, and my daughters have gone through several as well, so I have tried probably 15 different irons in the past several years. Typically, any iron that has tourmaline or ceramic plates is going to be smoother on your hair. Having the temperature dial and high heat capability is a nice feature to look for, which this T3 has. Some of the cheaper irons in the $20 range do not get as hot. A lot of us need the higher temperature to really get our hair straight. This one goes to 410 degrees. I have another one that goes to 430 degrees and I get the same amount of straightening from both. Anything above 400 degrees works well for me.It heats up quickly and cools down quickly. A little purple light will blink until it hits your desired temperature, and then will become a steady light.This one really looks nice as far as the color - black with really neat multi colored glitter. It has small rubber treads for grip, although I wish they were higher up towards the end of the iron so that you could use them when clamping the hair tighter.One thing I am not sure if I like, is where the power switch and temperature dial are located - inside, next to the iron plate. It makes it nice so that you aren't accidentally hitting them while using the iron, but you also have to be careful when turning it off or adjusting the heat so that you don't burn yourself.The cord is thick and looks/feels heavy duty. It doesn't seem to crink or twist up, even if you wrap your cord around your iron after use, like I do. The cord turns on the iron too, so it won't tangle.Overall, this T3 flat iron is a nice choice, but you can get the same results and quality from a cheaper unit. It just depends how much you want to spend. I gave it 4 stars. I knocked one off for pricing because I do not feel like it offers anything special for the extra cost, aside from the sparkles :)"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10996458679437637, 0.11644035577774048, 0.10625705868005753, 0.07944317907094955, 0.09912790358066559, 0.09997664391994476, 0.11083175241947174, 0.09456583112478256, 0.09034603834152222, 0.09304670989513397]]}
