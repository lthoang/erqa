I have always been wary of portable speaker systems because they tend to produce weak bass and overly shrill highs.  This is certainly not the case with the M650.  I was a bit stunned when I heard the bass of this unit.  The subwoofer is on the bottom so it takes advantage of the hard surface below to enhance the bass.  Deep bass is non-directional, so the placement of a subwoofer on the bottom does not affect sound quality in any way.  This is my third portable speaker system and sounds the best by far. I play a wide range of music, from heavy metal to classical - and all music sounds just fantastic on this unit.It comes with a small remote, and when you first dock your Ipod it prompts you to install the related app from the Apple App store.  You don't have to do so to use the unit, however, and I waited a few days.  The app adds an equalizer, and also displays some visual displays (a moving fireplace, a moving stream, cloud rolling in the sky against a mountain backdrop, etc.) that will play on your screen if you choose.  You can also just use your basic music app and never download or use the application.  This unit will also accept any MP3 device via a line-input jack, which makes it future proof for whenever the next device reshapes the audio landscape.  As others have noted, the power block/plug on this unit is a beast, so if you are outlet challenged, keep that in mind.Also, although the unit is portable, I'm not sure I would want to use it poolside or outdoors too much.  While it will probably be fine, it appears to be mainly designed for in-home or office use.This unit is not cheap by any means.  I have always been a bit surprised at the cost of portable speaker systems such as the M650, but I have learned this is an area where you get what you pay for.  This unit costs a few hundred dollars but the quality of the sound reflects the cost.  My cheaper speakers don't sound anywhere near this good. If you need great sound and great bass response, these are a good solution. I use these in my kitchen because I like to listen to Pandora while I cook.  For work, where the sound quality isn't as important because I can't really have it very loud, I use a smaller, less expensive solution.  Unless you go for a sub $50 speaker solution, you are probably looking at an additional $100 to get this speaker system. For the increased quality, I would recommend it - your ears will thank you.", "\"Update: Dec 8, 2011. I have been using this for two months now and I can say that I am extremely happy I decided on this model. Sound is full, remote is great, and it is just looks really nice. No regrets at all!!!The design and features, not to mention the quality of the sound of the Altec M650 speaker system sets it apart from many others in this price range. First, the dock itself is allows iPhones to fit using with any size case. Also, rumors abound that the next iPhone may be slightly larger, 4\"\" vs 3.5\"\" screen. If that happens then many current docks will not be compatible with newer phones and you know what that means - imagine spending $600 for a Bose 10 that doesn't fit your new iPhone/iPod!!! And, Yes, it does charge your device. The remote, unlike many, is full featured including dedicated Base and Treble controls, something you should expect at this price point. Plus, a free app includes four equalizer presets plus the ability to create several more of your own custom presets, all of which can be accessed from the remote or the app. So between Equalizer Presets, Bass & Treble controls, you have the ability to adjust the sound to what works best for your music. I listen to mostly classical but also jazz and talk radio using iTunes, Pandora, AccuRadio and TuneIn Radio apps. I may not want strong bass with talk radio since it is only voices so I can quickly and easily select the appropriate setting/preset. The App presets include Rock - punches the bass, Hip Hop, punches bass and treble, Pop - punches the midrange and to a lesser extent the bass, and the `Altec' preset which leaves everything alone. Lastly the free app has four mood/visualizer sounds with videos like waves crashing at sunset, a cracking fire, streams... These are useful for relaxation, reading, or just helping you fall asleep. In addition there are Audio In ports to hook up to non-Apple devices or a computer. Plus it also has ports to connect the video out to a TV - I haven't used this feature but these do help to set it apart from other docks.The unit is well constructed with a sturdy feel, sporting a beautiful, elegant design that will look good anywhere and uses two 3\"\" woofers and a 4\"\" subwoofer. The down firing subwoofer really helps create deep, rich sound. At this price point you should expect rich bass, not a tin box. Just be careful when picking it up so as not to press your fingers against the subwoofer at the bottom and also try to make sure it sits on something sturdy since that is what the subwoofer will vibrate off of. The unit has a blue LED power light and uses a series of small blue lights to show the volume, bass and treble levels while you are making a adjustment - then a few seconds later these lights will dim away, except for the power light.Of course what is most important is the quality of the sound - full and rich. When I got mine I ran pink noise through it from my White Noise App for three nights to help burn in the speakers. It is important to note that sound from a new speaker is not necessarily at its best because the speakers need to burn in to open up - like breaking in a new pair of shoes so be careful not to judge the sound of any new speaker too quickly. If you don't have the White Noise app, then get it or just use one of the mood sounds from the App like Mountain/Clouds to break it in. Bottom line, the sound is great, especially if it is in a small or medium size room. I do not have a very large room - mine is in my living room which opens to a dining area and performs superbly. Also, unlike some other docks and many types of computer speakers, the sound is not particularly directional - this is important if you will be moving around.Okay, so what's wrong with it. Nothing really but I would not have minded if they designed it slightly wider and included 3/4\"\" tweeters but I really don't have any complaints about the treble. However, I do have two small Cons, or rather, things to be aware of. First, at very high volume the sound will distort. For myself these volumes are louder than I will ever use it so this is not a concern for me but it might be if you blast your music. The other thing is that one of its virtues, the bass, can be unpleasant when listening to heavy bass music if the bass setting it all the way up. I suggest testing with your most bass heavy song to see for yourself. Turn it up all the way thensimply turn down the bass level until it sounds right and just leave it there. For myself this is only about 20-30% of max. The test doesn't work if the bass is maxed out and listening to non-bassy music so by adjusting this setting for heavy bass you will not need to play with the bass setting and instead can simply switch equalizer presets to optimize what you are listening to.I highly recommend this system to anyone that wants quality sound without spending a fortune. The current price, October 2011, is $199 but Amazon had a Columbus day sale for only $165 and that was when it moved from the wish list to the cart. I would expect another big sale on Black Friday. The unit is still relatively new but after six months or so from its introduction I would expect the price to drop below list.As a side note my short list included theKicker iK501 Digital Stereo System for iPhone and iPod (Black)andAudyssey South of Market Audio Dock.  I tested theBose SoundDock 10 Digital Music Systemwhich sounded wonderful but it did not make my short list because of price, $600, and the dock design which I do not think will work with a iPhone case plus the bluetooth option costs another $100- $150 dollars making the Audyssey SOMA dock a much better value. I also tested theBeats by Dr. Dre Beatbox iPod Dock High Performance iPod Dockin three stores and passed because everyone had a broken dock making me fear this would happen to me. The dock holds the phone just right so without it unless I held my phone perfectly then error messages would constantly pop up stating 'this device is not compatible'. Also, this system does not have Bass or Treble adjustments but it does have great sound and if you love to play 'heavy bass loud' then check it out since that is exactly what it is designed to do best. The Bose series II seemed overpriced for the features, or lack of them, and didn't sound any better. The iKicker has great reviews and a good price, currently less than the Altec M650, but I passed because I did not want a 6\"\" back facing subwoofer bouncing off my walls out of respect for my neighbors living below me. The 4\"\" downward facing subwoofer of the Altec hits the top of a old stereo cabinet that sits on a rug so no problems with neighbors walls or ceilings vibrating. Also, the dock design of the Kicker may or may not hold a phone with a think case and certainly not a slightly larger phone if that is what the future holds. The Audyssey SOMA has excellent reviews for sound quality with two 4\"\" woofers and two 3/4\"\" tweeters, includes bluetooth and similarly designed dock but it is $369 - making it better than the Bose 10 with the bluetooth option but almost 2x as much as this Altec. Bluetooth is a very useful feature as it does not tie up the phone but the downside is bluetooth is also a battery hog and will lower audio quality a bit. I may eventually get an Audyssey SOMA if the price drops and move my Altec 650 to my home office to replace my computer speakers and pick the Audyssey for my living room but for now I am glad I bought the Altec 650. You will not be disappointed in the sound and features but if you want something portable, (with batteries) then keep looking.Update: Dec 31st: A couple of times in the past two months the unit seems to have died (working great now) - no sound at all with a warning like 'device not compatible'. At first it drove me crazy as I tried to turn On/Off, both my iPhone 3GS and the Altec, but nothing. Then I simply I disconnected the power cord from the back of the Altec, waited about 60 seconds, then plugged it in and tried again - just like I do when my router or modem has problems. After that everything works perfectly and my settings, Bass, Treble... remained. Not sure what the problem is but at least I now know the fix. Anyway, I mention this since I have seen a few reviews that indicate this unit stopped working but perhaps in some cases this was the fix.\"", "\"As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I have been sent at about five different speaker units and headphones, similar to the Altect Lansing M650 speaker system. While I generally think most speakers are too overpriced, I find the sound quality of this system to be very good especially in my bedroom. Unlike other single unit systems, the M650 does include bass and treble adjustments/controls. When you're going to pay over a $100 for a sound system, I really do think you should be able to customize the sound quality.What I didn't expect to find in this unit is the 4\"\" subwoofer, which also makes it worth the price. A subwoofer definitely makes a difference when it comes to sound quality in music. I also use the sound system while watching Netflix videos on my iPad, and it greatly enhances the sound quality-especially given that the iPad speakers are not that great.I personally don't care much for docking my iPhone on the unit. I would much rather use a wireless Bluetooth connection. That way I can listen to music and still surf the net or use other apps. However, the unit does include an auxiliary cord that works just fine.As some other reviewers have pointed out, this unit is not particularly useful for portable transport. It does not come with a case, and the front cover is made out a cloth-like material, so it could be damaged.Overall, I think Altect M650 is great system. If you're not a audiophile, then you probably don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a speaker unit, so this one one might well be a comfortable price for many general buyers.\"", "I have bought quite a few speakers for my cell phones, MP3 players over the years, this one is by far the one with the best sound, clear & well balanced with good bass, though it cost the most. Remember what they say? You get what you pay for. I especially like the fact that it has a dock for iphone and ipod so that I can play my favorite music and charge the phone at the same time. There's even a free app that gives you an equalizer to play with, it has very intuitive interface, even my 9-year old learned how to use it with her ipod.", "\"Altec Lansing M650 Speaker System is simply amazing. When I set it up and played it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by its sound quality and its ability to fill a large room with sweet music. The highs are crisp and lows are deep. I compared it to my $300Harman Kardon Go+Play Micro Speaker System for iPod (Black)and they are both amazing sonically. However, I prefer the M650 for in-home use due to its appearance (the HK looks more like a boombox with its large stainless handle) and EQ controls on it. In addition, the M650 has a smaller footprint, perfect for placement on a bedside table or on a bookshelf.The M650 employs twin 3\"\" drivers on either side of the dock and a 4\"\" down-firing sub-woofer driver. The twin drivers are behind the front fabric grille and the sub-woofer is in the bottom of the unit and is not covered.There is a set of six buttons on the top left edge of the unit: power, volume +/-, bass, treble, and video. Each control is indicated with a series of five blue LEDs behind the fabric grille right below the buttons. The video button toggles between video off, composite and component output from the docked device. A small remote is also included. It offers the standard controls plus some prefixed EQ settings.Although the M650 is small and light enough to move from location to location. It can only be powered by the included AC adapter (while the HK has a battery compartment and is perfect for outdoor activities). The adapter is fairly large at the plug end and will take up some outlet space, especially on a power strip.One easily overlooked advantage the M650 has to offer is the flexible dock. Since the dock is located in front of the unit and there is no space constraint surrounding it, you can dock your iPod/iPhone with any custom casing on it. That's something that cannot be done for certain iPod/iPhone models on the HK due to the fixed width space surrounding its dock. In addition, the M650 offers a standard audio input for non-Apple audio devices such as MP3 players, TV or computers, although the cable is not included.The first time when you dock your iPod/iPhone on the M650, it will prompt you to install an application called \"\"Music Mood\"\" from the Apple store. It is basically an audio application that has some enhanced features such as multi-band EQ settings and some so-so visualizers. Of course, you could opt not to install it and simply use the iOS built-in features.To sum up, I'm very happy with the M650. It has a great room-filling sound with well defined treble and bass, all that from a small footprint. The $200 price tag may be a bit too steep for casual music lovers, considering the number of $100 systems available in the market. However, the much higher sound quality is worth the asking price. It can very well challenge some $300 Bose and Harman Kardon systems sonically too.\"", "I have an iPod Touch and iPhone. I can connect both to this system. I cannot emphasize enough how great this unit sounds and how much quality sound it puts out. I keep it in my kitchen / family room area and listen to tunes while in those rooms. The sound is crisp and clean, the bass and treble sounds are distinct and refined. You can download an Altec app to use as a control, works well.  Unit comes with a remote that also works well though has a very small range of about 10 feet which makes it rather inconvenient.I guess the one negative I have is that it is hard to put the ipod or iphone on the connector. The connector bends forward allowing you to place the unit on, but I have problems getting it on. Might just be my eye/hand coordination, but it is minor and I get it on after a few attempts.I highly recommend this unit and am thouroughly enjoying it!", "\"I'll start this off by flat out admitting, I'm not an Apple fanatic.  I have an iPod touch 3G and my son has a 4G.  Apple with it's quirky, locked-down devices are very annoying to deal with most of the time - it's not often you can buy a non-Apple device and have it work correctly (or at all) without a lot of fiddling around, downloading patches, tricks, etc.However, this device didn't have any issues immediately recognizing my iPod.  There is a slight learning curve with it because there are so many different features to try out - it just takes time to get through them all and decide.Just beware, this device ONLY works with APPLE products and as far as I can tell (from attempting to test an older video iPod and iPod shuffle), it only works with iPod touch devices.  So don't think this is something you could share with others who may have another type of player or maybe an older one, it won't work.Good to know:* 2.1 channel speaker system that lets you dock, charge and play your iPhone or iPod and even hook them up to your TV to enjoy your videos on the big screen. The unit features two full-range drivers and a nested subwoofer for balanced, powerful audio with extended bass. So while you're watching videos on your TV, you'll get the full experience with more robust sound than your portable devices are capable of providing.*By downloading a free app from the App Store, you can customize your music with a 7-band graphic equalizer with multiple presets and choose from a selection of relaxing ambient sounds and videos like ocean waves or the sound of rain. And when you get a call on your iPhone, no worries -- the music will pause so you can answer all your important phone calls even if you have the volume turned all the way up. Adjustments are easy with the onboard volume, bass and treble controls so you can tweak your sound. Or, if you're on the couch and want to navigate select iPod and iPhone features as well as system functions, the included remote can come in handy.*In addition to its sonic prowess, your new Octiv Docking Speaker System offers a sophisticated accent to any space. The unique wedge design means it carries a low profile to fit in tight spaces, but it's also unobtrusive. For an ideal companion for your iPod and iPhone with app-enhanced features, look no further than the M650 Octiv Docking Speaker System. It's even certified as \"\"Made for iPod/iPhone\"\" to ensure quality and compatibility with your Apple devices, so they'll be sure to get along.Cons:*The speakers can actually be a bit TOO loud and actually has hurt my ears.*it doesn't come with any type of cable to connect to your computer/netbook/laptop/etc.In summary, if you're looking for Bose speakers but can't or don't want to afford their high prices, this is a pretty good alternative.  The bass is deep without being muffled, the treble is clear without being warbly or screachy.\"", "I was quite surprised at the quality of the sound from this unit. I tested it in our living room, a large space in an open floorplan, and the sound filled the space pretty well considering how far apart the walls were. In the master bedroom, however, it was amazing! I put it on one side of the room and was surrounded by music.I did a comparison with ourBose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system, changing back and forth between them to see how each performed. In louder sections of music, the Bose did seem to retain more clarity, but the sound was highly directional. It's never an issue sitting at the computer, but compared to theAltec Lansing M650 Speaker Systemit did not fill the room with bass.Some quick points to consider...The Good:* Great bass and clear treble on all styles of music* Onboard EQ with presets and custom setting (really helps to bring the bass up or down as needed)* Remote works well in large room* Sound fills a large space* Small footprint, can easily hide away on a bookcase or shelf* Charges iPhone or iPod while in use (note: I tested it with an iPhone 3GS)* Video out on the back for playing iPhone or iPod video (have not tested yet, will update when I get a chance)* Auxiliary input for playing non-iPhone or iPod sources (something lacking from many other sounddocks)* Blue LEDs on front light up when changing volume or EQ to indicate levels, very handy* Decent size for travel, would be nice to have in a hotel roomThe Not-so-good:* It's a little tricky to get the iPhone off the dock connector at first. The dock is on a spring and angles back toward the speaker to hold it in place. It's easy to get off with two hands, but removing it with one takes practice.* Power cord is bulky and will take up extra room on your power strip. (note that the Bose sounddock removes the bulky portion of the power cable and places it along the cable instead of right at the plug.) This isn't a huge deal, just something to be aware of.* Music can lose some clarity at top volume levelsThat's about it, really. None of these three criticisms are a deal-breaker for me, and my wife loves having it in the living room. She will play music all day no matter where she is in the house and has told me several times how much she appreciates it. The $200 price tag might scare some, but not when you compare it to other serious sounddocks. In fact, compared to theBose SoundDock Series II Digital Music System for iPod (Black), which we've had before, it is a bargain and produces equal sound quality.I would recommend this to anyone wanting a simple solution for good sound from their iPhone or iPod in their home.", "The range of sound on this device is spectacular.  The bass is deep and full, the treble crisp and clear.  And since there is an actual equalizer available, you can tweak it to your heart's content.The setup is simple, the footprint is small and its appearance is sleek. The apps available are useful and free, the remote is very convenient and the unit worked perfectly with our iPod touches and our old iPod Classic.I can't recommend this item enough.  The $200 price tag is perfectly reasonable for the quality of sound this unit delivers.  It compares very favorably with my brother's Bose and at a much better price!", "There are a lot of iPod speakers on the market. They all cater to different needs. Some peeople like portable speakers. These usually aren't very loud so if you want your iPod speakers to blast music, you should buy this Altec Lansing M650 Speaker System.The thing that I was impressed with the most was the bass on this speaker system. Every speaker system has some sort of bass, but this bass is actually pretty good. It's very noticeable, which was a pleasant surprise.This speaker set is not as portable as others, so if you're going to get this set you should be aware that wherever you choose to put it is where its probably going to stay. Moving it around will be a hassle. But the sound is better than I've heard on most Ipod speakers. It'll really add to your workspace.", "\"Altec Lansing has a reputation for good sound, and this system is no exception. There's only one con which is why I say 4 stars, but it's no showstopper. First the pro's:' The SOUND. Wow, once you tweak treble and bass correctly for the type of music, the sound comes alive! Rich in tone, especially due to the added subwoofer.' I repeat, the addition of a subwoofer. Nothing adds fullness better.' My iPhone fits on the dock with my rubber Incipio case on. That's a real nice convenience.' Controls are placed right on top and there are blue LEDs that show you the level of bass, treble and volume, no guessing.' A really small and flat remote control is included, and I mean flat, must use a watch battery. No additional monster-sized remote to throw on the pile.' Component Video Jacks! I haven't tested them yet but there's no reason they shouldn't work. You can play video on your flat screen with rich sound coming from the Altec unit. Nice unexpected feature!' The sound. Did I mention how good the tone is on this thing? I'm picky, believe me.' The iPhone App. Download it and use it to play your tunes. Yes, the iPod will already do that, but there are EQ settings in the app that sweeten the sound. It's free, no brainer!OK, one con: the subwoofer gets overdriven VERY quickly with bottom-heavy songs (like the low B the bass player hits in Riverdance's \"\"Slip Into Spring\"\". I'm not expecting magic from a unit like this, but it got fairly tubby sounding quicker than I had hoped. Once you dial it back, it sounds great. Careful, there's no screen, you can pick this unit up and put your finger right through the subwoofer cone.All in all, if you want WOW sound for a device like this, look no further.\"", "If you are looking for a shelf-sound system for your bedroom or study area, the Altec Lansing M650 might fit the bill.  It delivers good sound and is compact.Now let me talk about the QUALIFIERS.First, the others are correct.  The base can be a little muddle.  I played various genres from Opera to Rock to Trance through the speakers and there are times with the timbre isn't crystal clear.  Interestingly, I found an old synth tune that was produced on a Commodore 64 and speakers simply couldn't reproduce that 'pure' base signal.  (I'm not an audiophile so I can interpret what this means.  Just thought I'd report.)Second, my husband pointed out that the volume control was digital, and oddly, the exact volume he was looking for, couldn't be achieved.  It simply lay between two selection levels, which meant that music was either too loud, or not loud enough.Third, I, on the other hand, took note that the highest volume might not be high enough for a dorm room.  (I may be old, but I still remember dorm parties.)  Those of you that like it loud enough to damage your hearing, might not find these shelf speakers sufficient for your AC/DC... or whatever else you like to listen to Full-BLAST.  Moms like me, however, might consider this a feature when considering this system for younger kids.Fourth, the remote control integrates perfectly with iPhone-type devices.  You can skip songs and whatnot.Fifth, you don't have to use an Iphone.  We've got ours cabled up to a laptop.OVERALL, I really liked the M650.  For most purposes it is loud enough and the sound is good enough to thoroughly enjoy your tunes.  Base might be a little muddy, but for a shelf system, these speakers are much better than the others I've enjoyed.Pam T~music lover/happy camper", "\"Recently I purchased and reviewed theDevotec Industries Solar Sound 2, Solar Powered Bluetooth Speaker For iphone,iPad and any MP3 Playerwhich I thought was incredible for a solar powered blue-tooth speaker system.So having the Altec Lansing M650 seemed superfluous to my iOS audio needs. I was very, very wrong and whilst I wouldn't expect a battery driven external speaker like the Solar sound to really compete with the power speaker set with sub, I wasn't expecting such a stark improvement.The first thing I noticed was the size of this set - extremely deep to accommodate the hefty 4\"\" sub which you can see underneath so take the time to gauge the measurements for your intended placement as this fellow's footprint is considerably larger than the current product pic suggests. Of course, that space is put to massive use and the M650 puts out large amounts of bass perfect for your summer deck parties. The second thing I thought was cool was the hidden multi-level bright blue LED lights which donate volume, power bass treble etc. They're tucked inside the speaker grill at the top left and so are invisible until the unit is switched on. Each LED has multiple levels of brightness denoting the current volume level which was a nice touch. The iPhone 4 I plopped onto the unit has a fairly hefty case on it but it fit without issue and immediately powered up to indicate the M650 was charging the iPhone. This was without the unit being on which is awesome. You can use this speaker system as a charger even if you're not playing any music or even have it on.I tried Pandora and it was then I realized what an amazing sound it pumps out. I added many stations of random sound - Tommy Dorsey, rap, hard rock and everything poured out with clarity and volume which totally belied the size (and cost) of the system. The tiny remote has many functions on it including the ability to custom EQ the sound or just choose from one of the presets.A final function, which I did not try, is the ability to output both audio and video from the system. The video output connections are component which is the red/green/blue RCA type which if your TV is more than four years old may not have and the product spec claims composite too which is the single yellow RCA. I assume one of the component outputs doubles up as composite as I did not see a dedicated composite connector. Either way it would allow you to view videos through the M650 onto your TV. As an Apple TV owner this is something I can do wirelessly from the iPad/iPhone so I didn't test it on this unit but it's a nice feature to have.All in all this is one of the best, if not the best, docking audio systems I've used and simply offers stunning sound from your phone/iPod without any issues. You may balk at the price but the speakers alone are worth the price of admission. The charger, the remote control, the video out are merely the icing on the cake.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.22061923146247864, 0.0001226994936587289, 0.00022088561672717333, 0.01931588165462017, 0.00015293940668925643, 0.3041759133338928, 0.00020080550166312605, 0.13520190119743347, 0.31914594769477844, 0.0001804169442038983, 0.000247520103584975, 0.00012422636791598052, 0.00029172562062740326]]}
