"], "reviews": ["\"Ginger SNAP is definitely the right word for these cookies. They are crisp, crunchy, delicious, and a little bit addicting. If crunchy is what you're after, these are the cookies for you.But if you'd rather have a softer ginger cookie, never fear. Just dip these in some hot tea and you've got a softer, chewier cookie that is just as tasty. We've found that we actually prefer the cookies this way.The ginger is fairly powerful and has a bit of \"\"ginger burn\"\" to it, but it's by no means overpowering. Our two year-old typically dislikes ginger cookies, but he really liked these. The sugar content is low enough that letting him eat one or two is no big deal.So, if you like ginger cookies, give these a try. We have enjoyed them quite a bit.\"", "\"I like ginger snaps, but these are *GINGER* snaps, definite stress on the ginger. The cookies contain both candied and powdered ginger, but no cinnamon or nutmeg - it they do, then they fall into the category of \"\"spices,\"\" which is found at the end of the list of ingredients.The cookies themselves are quite interesting, very gingery and crisp. Children will probably find them a bit overwhelming, but adults will find their taste interesting. I find they go well with coffee or tea, or a nice flavorful schnapps.(Review of Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies)\"", "I had high hopes for this organic ginger snap and unfortunately, I was disappointed. I don't know if it's because it is organic or just because of the kind of ginger snap this is, but the ginger flavor is so strong that I couldn't finish my first cookie! They are just about too hard to even eat. If you love a strong taste of ginger and you like hard cookies, then you might like these, but otherwise, stay away.", "I like Newman's Own line of foods and trust their quality. These ginger snaps are crunchier and spicier than your average gingersnap. There are bits of real candied ginger in each cookie which explain the strong burst of flavor in every bite. If you love ginger, you'll love this cookie. I love them. My only complaint is that the cookies taste a bit too sweet for me. There is 130 calories per 5 cookies. Each cookie is the size of a half-dollar coin. You don't need a lot. A small handful delivers quite a treat.", "In my mind there are two types of ginger snaps...soft and chewy and hard and crunchy.  Just so you are aware, these are the crunchy kind.Like most gingersnaps they're fairly low in calories.  Each cookie is about the diameter of a half dollar and based on the nutrition info (5 cookies = 1 serving = 130 cal) they're about 25 calories each.Gingersnaps also range in the flavors...this one has the molasses defined and some complex spice flavors...ginger is fairly predominate though...a little harsh, but if you like that good enough.Pretty good all in all.  Nothing special - don't know if I'll buy them in the future, but I'm enjoying munching them and when I'm in a gingersnap mood these would certainly fulfill the craving so good enough!", "I confess I do not like ginger, I got these for my husband who like gingery gingersnaps, and well... he loved them! Crunchy, fresh-tasting, and spicy! Enjoy a nice cookie break with these!", "If you are a fan of ginger snaps then I believe you owe it to yourself to give these a try.I love ginger, and I thought these were really authentic -they really tasted like ginger, and not a watered down cookie with a bunch of other ingredients that made it taste more like a shortbread cookie with ginger flavoring...These cookies are completely organic, which made me feel even better about eating them.  (I mean, they are still cookies, but at least I can avoid some of the ingredients that don't add value to my health.)They had bits of crystalized ginger in them, and they tasted slightly spicy (because of the ginger) and, best of all, they snapped when I broke them.  So, they had ginger, and they definitely had SNAP: the best of both worlds!Recommended to those who want a more traditional ginger snap cookie, and who like cooking with fresh ginger root.", "When I first pulled out one of these little cookies, I was nonplussed. I don't think they're particularly attractive,having an uneven and almost burnt look. But the taste soon convinced me otherwise. These have a very good, very ginger-y and somewhat spicy flavor. I really enjoyed the little bits of ginger that are in each cookie, so that after the cookie is gone there's often a chewy bit of ginger that lingers. Yum. Also, they are smaller, like a silver dollar, and so grabbing a handful of these organic vegan gems does not bring on piles o' guilt. Excellent for gingersnap connoiseurs.", "\"Though I am normally a fan of Newman's Own products, these cookies were terrible. Twice the thickness of other gingersnaps and very small (around 1 1/2 \"\" in diameter), they have little or no ginger flavor. This alone would have discouraged me, but the bag I received was also burned. They weren't simply very browned; there were burned spots around the edges, and the bottoms were blackened. The first (and only) one I ate filled my mouth with a strong burned taste that lingered. I checked the rest of the cookies, but all seemed to be burned. Hopefully, this is a quality control issue that can be resolved, but I will not be trying them again.\"", "Ginger Snaps are my hubby's favorite cookie.  He tells me that the flavor was great and had a good after taste.  He did notice that they were beyond crunchy to the point of being hard.  Some also were burned on the bottom like someone failed to take them out of the oven soon enough.This surprises me as the other Newman brand products I have tried were as I expected them to be with no negative points.  Maybe this was a bag that got past the inspection team.If you don't mind the crunchiness and a few darker than normal bottoms, the flavor is great.", "Ginger is a favorite flavor and these snaps really deliver. Often I find that ginger flavored baked good have a chemical taste that reminds me of soap, but not these cookies, the taste of real ginger shines through. I also love the fact that all profits go toward the Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, a worldwide network of facilities that give sick, disabled, and disadvantaged kids the opportunity to have a summer camp experience.", "I do, I really try to not eat cookies and other treats but ginger snaps, and Newman's Own ORGANIC ones at that, free to sample?  This was more than I could resist.  So I set myself up with my bag of cookies and a mug of cold rice milk to research for my review.  These are very good - definitely crunchy but not rock hard and they yield very nicely when dunked.  They are bursting with real ginger flavor and the tiny chewy bits of ginger is the crowning glory.  For me there is nothing not to like.  If you love ginger you will love these.", "These are the best ginger snaps I have ever tasted. The ginger taste is intense but not over-powering. I like that they added little pieces of candied ginger to the cookie. It's a nice touch. I appreciate that the ingredients are ones I can actually pronounce. There are no ingredients in this cookie that make me wonder what I am eating. These are all ingredients that one would use baking cookies in their own home. The cookies are approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in size and there are approximately 30 cookies in the 6.5 ounce bag. The bag comes with a resealable tape so you can close the bag up tight to preserve the freshness and snap of these delightful little cookies. The cookies are very crunchy but not break your teeth hard like some ginger snaps can be. They have the perfect density for a ginger snap. I highly recommend these ginger snaps and I myself will be buying more of them.", "\"These cookies are my new guilty pleasure - worth every calorie. I had to order a case after trying the first sample bag. I just can't stop nibbling away at these cookies. They are absolutely addictive.They are very crisp and a bit hard, so if your teeth are sensitive, plan on dunking these in your favorite beverage. The ginger taste is pungent, quite strong. They are loaded with tiny dried bits of candied ginger that turn chewy in your mouth. The ginger flavor is so intense - not for the faint at heart - that my mouth actually tingles with that \"\"ginger burn\"\" I enjoy so much.So if you like mild, boring, blah-tasting grocery chain wafers, stay away from these. But if your taste buds are ready for a wake up call, then these organic cookies are just the ticket.\"", "\"Although I knew that ginger snaps were supposed to be hard, I was surprised by how much so these Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps cookies were when I first bit down on one with my front teeth.  It hurt my teeth.  But I quickly adapted by shoving them deep into my cheek and bit down with my molars. I like them.  They have a very strong ginger favor and I am a ginger root lover, and  they are not overly sweet.  I liked them so much that I ate half a bag in one sitting.  There is a burnt favor in the cookies.  I wonder if the bakers had left them in the oven for too long.  They are also the smallest cookies I have ever eaten, measuring only 1-3/4\"\" across.  They fit my mouth perfectly.  There is a reusable tape on the bag, which can be used to reseal the bag.  It is thoughtful addition.  Overall, these are very delicious and flavorful cookies. I would have given them a 5-star rating, have they not been so hard.\"", "This is a very tasty ginger snap.  It has a clean and spicy taste and probably has more ginger flavoring than any ginger snap I have ever eaten.  I brought a bag in to my office and everyone really liked them and commented on the good ginger flavoring.  I would prefer them to be not quite as crunchy, as they break rather easily.  Still, it is a good snack and the organic ingredients are an added bonus.", "\"I'm a fan of ginger snaps and cookies. I can't have dairy, so I give a thumbs up to Newman's for making them vegan.I always think twice about ordering food through the mail since fragility often leads to damages. Mine arrived in great condition and the bag and snaps weren't crushed. These are fairly-priced too, which is a great deal for organic food. Sometimes organic stuff is just \"\"too rich for my blood,\"\" but not in this case. I'm giving you the green light to order!The serving size is five snaps, but let's be honest - these are delicious and we're going to eat more than five. They have a bit of a \"\"bite\"\" to the flavor, a real ginger spiciness, which is nice. I'd compare them to Swedish-styleMi-Del's Ginger Snaps, a personal favorite.\"", "\"Once I get past the concept of \"\"organic cookies\"\", which sounds like an oxymoron, I have to admit: these ginger snaps are not for wussies.  These little gems are really concentrated with ginger flavor; one might even say they're downright spicy.  The little bits of candied ginger are no small part of this potent taste.  They really impress as an old-fashioned style cookie, and remind me a bit of the British \"\"Ginger Nuts\"\".  As cookies go, they're not bad in the fat department either, with 130 calories per serving, 30 from fat.  If you like your ginger flavor strong, these are the cookies for you.\"", "\"Mrs. Boilermate is from the Philadelphia area. One of the local treats there is Ivins Spiced Wafers, a ginger snap-like cookie that seems to evoke a \"\"love 'em\"\" or \"\"hate 'um\"\" reaction. Personally I love the crisp cookie and the fairly strong spice flavor. Other family members, however, call them \"\"hockey pucks.\"\"Before ordering these from Vine I scanned the early reviews, and saw a similar trend. Now that I've tried them, I come down on the \"\"love 'em\"\" side. These are an adult cookie and would go well with a cup of tea.I like the crisp texture and the prominent, but not overpowering, ginger flavor. These cookies have tiny bits of candied ginger mixed in. This is a bit of a two-edged sword. While they contribute to the prominent ginger flavor, they are also gummy and stick to my teeth, hence the four-star rating. I did not detect any aftertaste.I can't comment on the effectiveness of the peel-and-stick tab for resealing the bag...I never needed it.I have been a \"\"fan\"\" of Newman's Own products for years and these cookies have done nothing to change that. Newman's is proof you can have an ethical business model and still be successful.Bottom line: I will buy these when they hit the stores here.\"", "These are very, very crisp cookies.  So if you like a softer cookie, you may not want to buy these.  They do taste good, though, especially with coffee.  However, I did notice that after eating 3 or 4 of them, there was definite heat from all the ginger.  These are fairly healthy cookies, made with mostly organic ingredients.  They weren't the best ginger cookies I have ever eaten, but they were an enjoyable snack.", "I really like these ginger snap cookies, but they may not be for everyone. They have a strong ginger flavor, however a little light on any cinnamon/nutmeg flavor. They are thicker than the gingersnaps I ate as a kid, but I personally like the meatier, thicker cookie because it gives the cookie a strong crispy, crunch that goes extremely well with my morning hot tea or coffee.", "These cookies are awful. Amazon packed them in a padded envelope, so I figured I'd have a bag of crumbs, but every cookie was whole because they are as hard as rocks. The batch I got was full of burnt and blackened cookies. I ate half a cookie and threw the rest away.I thought I might have got a bad batch, but many other reviewers reported the same thing. I generally like Newman's Own foods, but there is nothing redeeming about this cookies.", "These are a bit different than your average variety ginger snap.  With actual bits of chewy, candied ginger and strong spice that's zingy with a hint of a bitter aftertaste.  Not unpleasant to me, but I can see where some might not like it.  Personally, I find the complex, strong flavors interesting and tasty.  I like 'em.The cookies are very crisp (hard) so they'll definitely snap!  Great for dipping in hot tea or with ice cream.", "This cookies have a great bite to them - the perfect gingersnap! The ginger tastes fresh - like it's just been peeled! They're crispy without being rock hard as some bagged cookies tend to be. Even more impressive than the taste is the short ingredient list - no fillers, fake colors/ flavors, or nasty preservatives. They have a good fat- to- total calorie ratio, so I'd be comfortable keeping them around as a quick snack, and the peel-off sticker for resealing will help them good on the road. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone who likes ginger!", "I received Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps today.  They were delivered by the U.S. Mail and they are so hard, that even the mail carrier did not crush them when they were stuffed in my mail box.  I did not expect the cookie to be so hard and have a burnt appearance.I really wanted to like these cookies because I do try to buy organic products when I can.  However, these cookies had a strange flavor that lingered long after I finished one.  The ginger is just overpowering.  My tongue is still tingling a bit.  Maybe it is just me because other reviewers have given this cookie high ratings.I think that Newman's Own Organics makes some wonderful items, but this is not one of them.  I will buy Nabisco Ginger Snaps next time.", "These are hard little cookies, but with good taste. Has a great ginger taste, I like the flavor. The cookie is a bit smaller in size than an oreo cookie. It is hard to bite into with front teeth because the cookie is so hard, but it is small enough to pop the entire cookie into your mouth and enjoy. Gives you a nice spice aftertaste. It was actually kind of hard for me to eat just one, I like the flavor. For some reason these cookies kind of remind me of Mother's brand cookies.The bag is easy to open and there is a reseal tab attached to keep the freshness of the cookies. Nutrition Facts says the serving size is 5 cookies (30g) and 130 calories per serving.", "I couldn't bite into these without dipping them in something to soften them.  So I poured some milk to dip them in and gave them a try.  These were so hard that I couldn't break them in two with my teeth.The milk solved this problem.  These are very tasty if you can soften them.  I LOVE the strong ginger flavor.  I didn't care for the candied ginger pieces, as they were hard to chew and got stuck to my teeth.  If these cookies didn't have that in them, I would give them a 4.  There are 130 calories in 5 cookies that are a little bigger than a half dollar.  I like the fact that they are organic, and made with natural ingredients.  I have always been a fan of the Newman's Own products.If you love ginger, don't mind hard little crunchy candies getting stuck in your teeth, and love to dip these in coffee or milk, then give them a try.", "I LOVE ginger - anything ginger.  I was psyched to try these.  These cookies do have a very intense spicy ginger flavor. You will love that if you are a real ginger fan, otherwise that could put you off.  My only complaint is that they are SO hard...  if you prefer a chewier ginger cookie, these are not for you.", "My husband and I love ginger snaps.  I particularly like making triple ginger snaps where the secret ingredient is freshly ground pepper for the extra kick.  When I think of ginger snaps I think of flat, spicy, and crispy.  These organic Newman's Own ginger snaps have that spicy ginger taste but are thicker than normal which make them harder to bite into.  If you don't like crunchy cookies, these aren't for you!  But if you do like ginger snaps then you'll like these.  I'm enjoying the ginger after taste as I type.Just to let you know, not all the ingredients are organic and it contains soy.Nutritional Information:Serving size 5 cookies (30g)6 servings per bagCalories 130Calories from fat 30Total Fat 3.5gSaturate Fat 1.5gTrans Fat 0gCholesterol 0mgSodium 180mgTotal Carbs 24gDietary Fiber 0gSugars 12gProtein 1 g", "Get a good bottle of hot ginger ale and sit down and eat a few of these things.  When I first got these I had high hopes and I was not disappointed.  I like hot ginger items and this fits the bill.  Yes, they are crunchy but hey, a good cookie is.  I like the fact that they are hard and not soft.  When you bite into the cookie the first thing you taste is ginger.  When you are done you taste ginger.  They are ginger cookies, not bland no taste cookies.They do remind me of a good ginger ale.  They will wake you up in a heartbeat and make you want more.  Give them a shot and you wont be disappointed.  However, if you are a ginger wimp, you should probably stay away.My box was well cooked, not burnt and tasted excellent.  I will be buying these in the future.", "First off, the flavor of these cookies is excellent. TheY really have that spicy fresh/candied ginger bite. Unfortunately, the overall texture and density of the cookie doesn't do justice to the flavor.The cookies are very hard and dense, much like peppernuts. But they're too big to get away with it like peppernuts do. So instead they just seem too hard and kind of stale.I did like that there wee lots of funny odd-shaped cookies, not all perfectly uniform factory specimens. I don't know whether mine weree flawed or this was by design, but I thought it charming.If you're going to crush these for a recipe, for instance, pumpkin pie crust, they would be outstanding. They're also great dunking cookies for tea and coffee--here the hardness really works. But on their own, they just come off as stale, dry cookies with a great ginger kick.", "These are a really nice ginger snap with a very strong ginger taste.  If you don't care for ginger (why would you eat these if you don't?), then you may want to stay away.  I loved the crisp cookie with the spicy ginger flavor.
