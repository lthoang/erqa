Most reviews on Amazon have been positive so I put this particular system at the top of my list.While preparing to order, I searched around the internet and found many many negative reviews about Swann products (as well as others like Lorex, Q-See and other systems targeted at home users).  These reviews, made by people 'in the industry' were all very negative towards all these home systems. At first glance, I listened to these reviews but I eventually started ignoring them thinking that these 'professionals' were more interested in selling higher-end systems than providing real quality reviews of DIY systems.I should have listened to these other reviews.I ordered this system after weighing the pros/cons of using a full IP based system over a more traditional CCTV system.  The fact that this system (and others) have a DVR, smartphone viewing and other features pulled me toward the CCTV approach.I received the order the next day (I love Amazon's service...top notch).  I immediately pulled the system out and started connection it up to test it out.  I was immediately disappointed.The build quality of the DVR is poor.  The BNC connectors on the back almost ripped out of the back of the cheap aluminum backing when connecting a few cameras to test. The BNC cables that came with the system are ridiuclously thin and cheap (and it appears that there is a lot of image quality loss along the cables...or just really poor cameras).After I connected 3 cameras, I connected the DVR to my TV to get a feel for the image quality. I was really disappointed.  The  quality was bad. Real bad. Strike 1.Thinking that perhaps the quality I was seeing was due more to my TV than the system, I wanted to view the cameras via my computer and iPhone using the Swannview products. I downloaded the Swannview iPhone app and, after setting up my port forwarding on my local network and testing that it works, I tried to view the cameras.  Nothing. the iPhone app doesn't work (and many people have said as much on the iPhone app reviews).  Strike 2.Finally, I tried to use my PC browser to view the cameras.  IUsing my browser, I visited the IP address of the DVR and was then told to download viewer. Using the Chrome browser on a PC, the system tries to make me download a Mac application. Using Internet Explorer (IE), the system tries to make me download an ActiveX control - that will not install due to security settings in IE.  Rather than futz with IE (I don't use it anyway), I switched over to my Mac Mini to view the cameras. After installing the Mac viewer, I was finally able to view the DVR and cameras....and was horrified by the quality of the images.  Strike 3.3 Strikes and your out Swann. This system is being returned to Amazon for a refund. I should have listened to the negative reviews around the web.A note on the camera setup while test:I set the cameras up 10 feet from my desk and pointed all three at the desk and my chair so that my face would be in all three.  With all three approaches above (TV, iPhone and Desktop), I couldn't see any identifying features in my own face. That right there is bad cameras. From 10 feet, I should be able to identify myself.This system may be OK for anyone wanting to keep an eye on things around their house, but if you ever need to actually identify people to law enforcement, I doubt you'll be able to with these cameras.\"", "For what I paid ($240), this is not a bad unit. I have a nicer system myself, and bought this to install at my girlfriends place. The DVR is a step up from some of the lower priced Swann units, the menus are easy to navigate and the ethernet setup is quick as long as you know how to forward ports in your router. We havent tried the smart phone viewer yet. The motion detection seems to work better than on previous models, on those you were either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Swann seems to have figured it out on this model. The cameras, well, I am not so impressed there. The wider viewing angle is nice, but the night vision is seriously lacking. I have used Swann's lower priced BullDog camera in the past, and night vision is much better on it than it is on the Pro-550. The BullDog camera will stay in color mode at night if you have just medicore lighting, the Pro-550 goes to black and white mode even before the sun goes down. The down side of the wider viewing angle is that everything seems to be farther away than what it really is. If you are watching a large area it might be ok, but facial recognition is lacking from as little as 15 feet. After I ordered mine, the price of this set jumped up to around $399, I wouldnt pay that much for it, but at my $240 price, it seems to do the job.", "These aren't amazing. They work pretty well for what they do though. Mine came with the 640 tv line cameras and a note saying it was a free upgrade (Amazon name said 530, box said 600, actually got 640), I assume they do this for everyone though. I ran one camera a week because my attic is a terrible place to be. Still have two more to run. So far they have been good. My main complaint is the interface. All of them. The DVR interface, mobile version, and web version. Heads up for the mobile version, you have to use the admin account and the first 6 digits of your admin password. I also had to get more cabling but I wont knock it off for that, I needed longer runs. I'm also going to spray mine with insecticide some time because spiders apparently love these things. I have to brush off webs about once a week. The night vision on them is ok but not spectacular. I bought some solar lights and a flood light that has a low setting to help with that. It's a good camera system but not what I was hoping. If you want a super high end system with 1080p video and such, expect to pay 4 times as much. If you get good lighting, this system will be perfectly fine I think. Just an extra layer of security.", "This is not a quick install, yes running cables takes a while, but getting it finally to an Iphone takes router configuration, and downloading and configuring the Swann View Pro app, takes more time.  IN the end, nice cameras, and I can watch later any events.  The cams have a nice red glow at night and shows that they are there.", "i can never keep this thing working.  the web portion doesnt work. the cameras are good. i think ill try and get a new recording unit to use with the cameras as this one is pretty useless.", "WOW this is just in a word: AWESOME. I just received my Swann digital video recorder surveillance system and was able to hook it up with surprising ease, I find myself already checking out the perimeter of my house on my iPad when I'm out! haha this is just so cool I should have got one ages ago and with the built in hard drive with a massive amount of space for taping anything or anyone. The range of things I can use this for or check on is immense! from checking to see if a package i have been waiting for has been delivered and furthermore making sure if a merchandise delivery left on my doorstep is taken I got them on camera, no matter if its day or night, I am seriously impressed at the night vision on this device. The cameras are also very nice and compact they don't draw attention and stick out asking to be vandalized like some of the older models that look like a white shoebox, I am very happy with my 4 cameras ( front door, back door, side entrance, back yard) but I love the fact that if needed I could add 4 more cameras! I'm still entertaining the idea but loving this already, for people who work at home like myself its just so necessary. The options are fantastic too if i wanted to save space I can switch on the motion detectors or just let it roll all day and check it from my smartphone, software included of course which is great because for the price I don't want to be nickel and dimed. I have no doubt that it will be able to withstand the weather that is to come here in a northeast winter, when i was installing it I could feel how durable the cameras are. This system is great because of its versatility it would be just as much use to the person who wants some home or business security to the hobbyist just looking for a little added privacy, a deterrent against vandalism etc etc. this is so easy to install you will be up and running within 24hrs, it is freakishly addictive to watch whats going on at your home when your out on any one of your devices and if you go away on business or just travel for lea sure often this is a must have! absolutely a home run, only question is whether I should buy 4 extra cameras which it accommodates.", "I should have listened to the 1 and 2 star reviews.1- camera quality is horrid. This is not at all what they were selling based on what I read. My old cell phone camera had ten times better resolution and clarity. In my house, brightened room, was fuly grainy and looked like 1980s low quality video.2- Although they say it is for outside and inside use, the camera attachments are not rated for outside and the elements at all. I would imagine putting these outside would require replacements fast (south florida, lots of humidity and rain). I was going to use these outside. Not able to do that.3- software is rather ancient looking and feeling.4- backup is available...not through the ethernet cable....not through an external drive...but ONLY allowed with a USB flash drive. Right. I am going to get my 64gb flash drive and start manually moving 500gb worth of vids..5- manually move vids...yep..gotta pick one and select to backup to your usb flash drive. This would be awesome in 1997. Too bad it is 2013 where most devices use ethernet, wireles, or allow a huge drive, like a 3TB, to be connected for back ups.6- That is as far as I got. Once I reread all the issues about no support and inability to get repairs...I realized this unit would be heading to the garbage bin in 6 months. And due to the poor pic quality would be nothing more than a novelty to show visitors (who wish they would be able to see themselves more clearly in the vids).All in all, I am glad for the other reviews making my mind up to return this. It seems like an older type of system dressed up as a new vibrant state of the art. It is not (in my own opinion).Will move on to other items.", "I have several of the more expensive Panasonic POE cams. I got these because the whole set of four, with DVR, is half the price I paid for each of the Panasonic cams... they also have night vision, but lack pan, tilt and zoom. The Swann cams are very easy to install, set up, and use.  I did not even read the manual at all... it simply worked. I was easily able to view the cams within Internet Explorer and via the client software provided by Swann.  I do not suggest that people even bother installing any software on a PC, just use IE.  I have the system hard wired to my home LAN and that worked just by plugging it in.  I have not yet been able to view the cams from over the internet outside my home, but I plan on getting that up and running next.  I did try to download the viewer on my Blackberry, but Swann does not seem to support my model of BB yet.  There is no sound.  The video is average, but not sharp.  Night vision works a bit, but only in a very limited area.  So far it has only been running one day, so I don't have a lot to say yet.  But I do wish I got the model with 8 cams instead of only 4.  Not to have four more of these model cameras, rather, to add some better/more cams on to the 8 cam DVR.  Definitely worth the price.UPDATE:I am easily able to view the cams on my iPad and also outside my home.  I still believe this is worth the price.  I recently upgraded to a 16 camera professional model DVR though... not because there is anything wrong with this model, rather, because I needed more than 4 cams.  In fact, if anyone wants my old one, minus the hard drive and cameras, I'd be happy to give it to them for FREE.  Just send me a message here, you can pay for shipping, and I'll give it to you free."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.017284180968999863, 0.19289101660251617, 0.06121308356523514, 0.13264356553554535, 0.07011976093053818, 0.2666698396205902, 0.259091317653656, 8.726356463739648e-05]]}
