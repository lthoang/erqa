This is from a combination of the new HD pro sensor and a good lens system.  It fits pro quality video into a package that doesn't look too oversized to take to your kids school play.  The quality in normal indoor low light settings is exactly why you should buy this model over Sony or Panasonic.  The Canon will get you better PQ in normal (non-perfect) environments.  I have no problem with stabilization \"\"wobble\"\" in practical use - you can induce it if you try, but it's not an issue otherwise.Sound is adequate and what you'd expect with on-body mics.  If you have pro needs you should be running a separate audio path anyway and sync it in post.Touchscreen and menu system is the only weak parts of the package.  The touchscreen is not capacitive like you're used to on your smartphone - it requires pressure to work.  The organization of the menu system and setting restrictions when in Auto mode is aggravating and close to illogical.  There are plenty of things they should let you adjust that you can't.  If you go into manual mode, you can tweak just about everything, but good luck finding where to change it.  (Even if you've found it once before.)  I never knew a menu system could be made this badly - it's by far the most badly organized system on any video or still camera I've ever seen (and I've seen many).The standard battery is a little short on power.  On a +$1k camera it really shouldn't be that skimpy.Bottom line - this camera really nails the most important parts (so 5 stars): fantastic PQ in a discrete package with the best low light performance you'll find under $2k, and extensive control over just about every parameter.  The real differentiator here is the new bar in low light performance that other manufacturers will be forced to match in the future.  In 5 years we'll look back and remember how bad the early HD CMOS cameras were, and how Canon led the industry towards better PQ in everyday use.It's incredible that this $1200 camera is sharper than the XH A1 ($3500) I had just a few years ago.Update 9/29/12: Still a great camera and still love it.  Canon are using the same CMOS sensor in more of their cheaper models now (with cost reduced lenses).\"", "This camera is a stellar performer, blowing away my Sony cams with better image quality.  Extremely versatile and reliable.  I haven't had a single problem with it.  I do promo video for local bands and this camera comes along for every shoot.  If I could, I'd replace my Sony's with a few more of these.", "I've owned the Canon HFS200 camcorder for a while, and recently decided to upgrade. Not that the HFS200 isn't a great camera - it's just that the quality gap between it and my still cameras seems to be more and more noticeable. Dynamic range and high ISO noise, for example, are more like a point-and-shoot with the HFS200 than with a high-end DSLR.Looking at the choices, it seems like there are two ways to go: wait for prosumer models like the new Canon HF G10, or take the step and invest in true professional gear.The HF G10 has a lot going for it. I like that Canon actually went to a lower resolution, optimized for HD at 1920 x 1080. This means each pixel site is larger, giving you much better low light performance and dynamic range. For this feature alone, I'd recommend the HF G10 over the older models.In addition, the HF G10 offers better battery performance, has 32GB of internal memory plus dual SD slots, and a more sophisticated lens than previous models. The new lens features a rounded, 8 blade diaphragm, making those out of focus parts of your scenes look smoother - no more out of focus hexagons, common with the older lenses. The new lens is wonderful in manual operation, if you want to manually focus as you follow a subject. Many of the other features - image stabilization, auto focus accuracy and so on - aren't appreciably different than the previous generation products (which were already quite excellent).In terms of construction quality, the HF G10 is about as good as anything you'll find in the prosumer space. It's solid when you pick it up, but lots of plastic parts, and I doubt it would survive getting caught in a dust storm or rain shower. Still, the viewfinder and built-in monitor are high quality and make it easy to frame and compose your shots.Picture and sound quality are of course stunning, and it's easy to import video into your favorite editing software.About the only hesitation I had was around the video codec and bit rate. Many people evaluate cameras based on resolution (1920x1080/30p, for example), but another important dimension is bitrate, since that gives you a sense of how heavily compressed the images are. You can have 1920x1080/30p at many different bitrates...consumer camcorders do 10-18 Mbps, higher end products tend to go up to 20-25 Mbps and broadcast quality systems are 40 Mbps and up. The HF G10 is 24 Mbps at its highest setting.Where the dilemma comes in is that Canon's pro-grade XF100 HD (for instance) is based on essentially the exact same technology as the HF G10, but it includes 4:2:2 color sampling and a codec that goes up to 50 Mbps. It's also more expensive, however.If the HF G10 offered the codec found in the XF100, I'd give it my unconditional recommendation. As is, while the HF G10 is by all measures a wonderful product, you still might want to consider the higher-end XF100 for absolutely best image quality. Definitely recommended, with that one footnote, however.", "\"There's a million articles around about all the merits and disadvantages of the multitude of options available on this camera (24p, full HD, AVCHD, compression, etc.).  I'll leave those discussions alone.  What I will say is that the quality of video produced by th G10 is outstanding.  Wide dynamic range, beautiful low light (indoors), very acurate color - it's all there.  A few subtle but key features make this a terrific camera:  58mm filter attachment (let's me access my SLR arsenal of filters), solid built in microphone (it's pretty darn good), light weight yet solid feel, beautiful display as well as a good electronic view finder, manual focus ring, and more.My first outting (to the zoo) I set it to \"\"Cinema\"\" which defaults to 24p with a \"\"dull\"\" wide dynamic range filter.  I was actually pretty disapointed with the picture, and the 24p doesn't do much for me (I rendered to Blu-Ray and played back on my Vizio HDTV).  Next outting, I mounted a circular polarized filter on the lens and set the camera to M (Manual).  I selected the highest bit rate (MXP) which produces full 1920x1080 and set the frame rate to 30p.  Wow.  On an overcast Novemeber day (here in Colorado), the footage was amazing.  From motion, to dynamic range, to color reproduction the video is truly the best I've ever shot.  Auto mode is fine as well, however I think it sets the frame rate to 60i, which I do not like (messy in editing).I've also played around with some of the other features (there are a bunch of \"\"filters\"\" available in Cinema mode, which are pretty nice versions of standard NLE filters - I recommend doing this sort of thing in a NLE).  The 8 blade iris does produce nice bokeh, although nothing like my f1.4 prime slr lens.  The \"\"teleMacro\"\" feature happens automatically in AUTO mode, and I still don't see how it is any different than just zooming in with the apeture opened up.I teach introductory video production using macs, but prefer a PC at home.  I have not imported any video to my Mac yet, but the full HD video is cumbersome on my PC (Intel i7).  This is not a reflection of the camera, but you should be aware that full HD is a beast.  The Canon software seems like it might actually be useful for cataloging and importing (a first for Canon!).Complaints:  Not many.  You will need to buy an additional battery.  The lens hood is a great feature, but it seems flimsy.  I would have prefered a full sized accesory shoe.  I could have come up with a better place to put the headphone jack and the external microphone jack.  I would also have added another \"\"shoulder strap point\"\" similar to an SLR.  The touch screen is not a friendly as my iTouch (you have to press pretty hard).  This also makes your preview screen constantly smudged.  I often film from the hip, so I would have made the trigger button(start/stop) easier to push while holding this way.Add ons:  Get a bigger battery.  Right away I slapped a 58mm UV protective filter on the end (keep the lens safe and clean).  I bought an after-market lens cap with a keeper cord.  I rigged a shoulder strap from some climbing gear (prusik cord and spectra sling) to keep it tied in (no drop!).  I do intend to film some rock climbing from a static line, so I'm trying to figure out a good holster system to keep the camera safe while I jumar up and down.  I'm looking at a simple slr zoom holster.Summary:  My last camcorder was a HV30.  Great HDV camera, but the mechanism was noisy, and the image quality was pretty flat (no dynamic range).  Plus, I'm done with 1440.  While expensive, the G10 is a remarkable step up.  Be prepared for cumbersome editing with full HD, but the improvement in quality and dynamic range, especially at low light as well as the \"\"pro\"\" feature set, make this camera well worth it.UPDATE:  Well, after three months, I'm even more impressed with the G10.  I've learned alot more about the unit, and I think I'll retract my comments about 24f.  You can access this in either P mode or the \"\"cinema\"\" mode, and you can also select the other frame rate options from either.  I have stuck with 30P as my monitors and HDTV don't refresh at a multiple of 24 (and I just like 30fps more).  I use (and teach) both mac and pcs for editing.  I use the G10 for personal video, and I publish to blu-rays, so I have stuck to my PC so far for editing the video.  I'll update more when I get around to putting some of the footage on my mac at work.  A great camcorder - no doubt.  You're only alternative is to spend a bunch more or go the DSLR video route (which has it's own advantages and disadvantages).I noticed that when the internal memory starts filling up, it takes a few seconds to complete a full stop from writing the file.  It's really not a problem, but a curiosity (could also be from so many files in one drive?).  Any ideas?UPDATE:  I've gone on and imported video to an iMac and MacBook without problem.  I've also had a chance to use a Canon HF400 (same sensor, smaller glass).  I used the HF400 along with my G10 to film a concert.  The video was clearly better using the G10.  The biggest area of improvement in the G10 was the high contrast of the subjects on stage (black curtain behind them under high lights).  The G10 handled it very well.  The HF400 did not do a poor job, but some of the highlights were bleached and lost the good color that the G10 got just fine.\"", "\"***UPDATE****After owning this camera for over a month I must say that I am beyond impressed with the quality and features of this camera. Initially, yes I was a bit lost as I had never worked with a video camera that gave the user so much control over the settings. It does great in full auto, but it would be a shame not to take advantage of the plethora of options and control available to the user in manual mode. The footage it creates is stunning for the price. I jumped the gun a tad when I wrote my original review regarding the convoluted menu. After a few days of tinkering the menu becomes second nature and is actually very easy to navigate through, you just have to familiarize yourself with it. If you're on the fence the only thing I would suggest is to wait a few weeks for the price to drop even lower. (The price fluctuation on this camera in particular is interesting)The more I use this camera the more I like it. The only issue/complaint I still have is like everyone else, I feel the original battery is a total joke. Get a spare or two if you plan on using this for more than 30 minutes, as the supplied battery will be drained within a half hour. One other issue is the location of the custom dial; I still don't like where Canon put the dial, but I have gotten used to it and it works like a charm.Otherwise, this is a great camera. I don't have the time or patience to deal with a million things in post, and this camera makes post a breeze as one doesn't have to spend days enhancing scenes to get a higher quality image; it produces great shots right off the bat.***********Excellent camera for both amateurs and the seasoned pro. Whether you're making a professional flick, a die hard low/no budget filmmaker or simply looking to film the family vacation at Disneyland, this camera will deliver. Hands down.NOTE: The frequent complaint about the complicated menu is in fact true to a point, but it should be noted that this problem is really just the annoyance of a learning curve and pretty much limited to the ADVANCED features of the camera in MANUAL MODE, so don't let that scare you off, as one can shoot in full auto all the time and still produce stunning results without ever having to even switch to manual mode, but once you learn and become familiar with the camera you will never want to shoot in auto mode again.You will WANT to shoot in manual mode most of the time, so prepare to be frustrated for a few days as you learn the advanced menu features. I think Canon decided to pay homage to Stephen King by modeling the menu system after the hedge maze from 'The Shining' - The good news is you catch on quick, but it will test your patience the first few times.PROSExcellent Video QualityShoots great in low lightExcellent sound from internal micAuto features and smart technology work greatAdvanced options and manual control for pro shoots or auto for simplicityCustom white balance with added Kelvin temp scale options that allows you to balance for basic lighting and then get creative by being able to cool or warm a shot as much as you want.Cinema Mode allows instant creativity without 10 hours of menu tutorials.CONSThe BATTERY - Yes, it's a total joke. Smaller than a 9 Volt and lasts about .5 hours - Less if you review footage or have to navigate through the menu system. (Which you will)LCD Screen - It's touchscreen (which is convenient) but within 5 minutes the screen will be smudged up. Sun or bright light + smudge = a screen cleaning every 5 minutes. Cell phone screen protectors are an option, but a cheap protector can fuse to the screen in the sun and bubble.User assigned buttons and wheel/dial are good in theory, but Canon designed them for people with 5 left hands, so using them usually produces shake and noise.Still Photos - Save the photography for the DSLR rig - The photo quality is good but that's about it.Price - Pro if you haven't bought it yet - Con if you paid $1500.00 for it a few months ago only to see the price drop to under $1000.00 - That hurts.Long winded review after 12 hours of testing, filming and familiarization:I put emphasis on the ease of use because I have read so many horror stories about how one practically needs to have a degree in rocket science to navigate through Canon's convoluted menu system in order to set up the camera to crank out good video. I quickly learned that this is not the case. If you can send a text or update your Facebook status, you will have no problem with the menu. You just have to LEARN it. Regardless of your background, the menu becomes a breeze after you learn it.HOWEVERFor the advanced settings, don't get me wrong; the menu can and will be a tad overwhelming at first and even the pro camera folks will probably find themselves muttering some creative profanity as they learn the various menus and how to navigate through the plethora of available manual settings. The settings themselves are very easy to adjust, ONCE YOU GET TO THEM -My biggest problem was the initial 'treasure hunt' through each layer of settings to manually adjust the settings where I wanted them, then going back in and trying to remember the sequence of events to get to one setting. You get the hang of it real quick though and it will become second nature. You can also store your custom settings which is great for run and gun shooting when one doesn't have time to dial everything in.Manual Mode is great (in order to not go totally insane in this mode you need to learn the menu and understand the basics of aperture, shutter speed, focus, etc) Shooting in manual mode involves time and know how. You can't slack off here.  Each shot might involve changing several settings - Mess up one setting and your shot can turn into fecal matter.Internal microphone is great and suited fine for home videos. Buy an external mic if you're doing anything beyond that for best results.Buy the camera and skip the cheap \"\"kits\"\" found online. For the most part everything in the kit is worthless, no name cheaply made garbage and usually breaks easily. The biggest problem are the cheap tripods in these kits - It's a crapshoot. You might get a decent no name tripod that lasts 50 years, or you get one that fails with your brand new $1k camera on it. Skip the kit and invest in:Extra BATTERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A good tripodA good camera bagA 58mm UV Protective Lens FilterI'd recommend an AWB Lens Cover - They work far better than a white card and are great when shooting in mixed light.A collapsible 5 in 1 reflectorAnd lastly, download, buy, borrow or steal the book \"\"A Field Guide to Canon G10 and XA10 Cameras\"\" by Warren Bass - This book is a lifesaver and should always be with the camera. The factory manual is written well but like most manuals, they are written by folks who assume the reader actually knows a lot about the subject. Set the factory one aside and grab Warren Bass' book instead. He explains everything in basic and easy to follow steps in a language that won't confuse the beginner nor bore the pro to death.\"", "I have been very pleased with this camcorder. I use it to video Sunday morning church services. The colors compared to the my old Sony is way better. Videos are clearer, brighter, and so color rich. I have only run out of memory one time.  I had thought about getting the camcorder with 64gb but the difference in price was just too much for me.  I decided to buy a couple of 32gb cards instead which I don't think I'll need as long as I edit my Sunday video fairly soon and upload it to Youtube then erase it from the camcorder before the following Sunday.  I did buy an external mike which helps pickup distant sounds much better.  I like the weight of this camcorder making it so light and portable yet powerful.  I am looking forward to taking this on vacation too.", "I bought this camera after comparing it with the Panasonic in the similar class, the Panasonic reportedly has fan noise issues so I settled for Canon. The other reason I picked canon is because I have some expensive filters already which I use on my Digital camera which I could use on this camcorder as well.  I bought this camera to take videos of my recent trip to Vietnam. I also bought 2 32GB class 10 SDHC cards. The camera has 32GB internal memory so that gave me plenty of space. I also took an external hard drive (500GB) and my laptop in case I had to copy over data if my memory fills up. On my month long vacation I shot approximately 12hrs of video @24p in Cinema mode, and I did not run out of space, I could have avoided lugging around the laptop and hard drive.The camera is very easy to use, I did have problems with the zoom button, although I slowed down the zoom speed it would still accelerate too fast if I applied too much pressure on the toggle switch, something that can be fix with practice. In Cinema mode, using Filter 2, I got some stunning colors. The image stabilizer works well, but if you are shooting on the move ie walking and running you might want to consider a camcorder stabilizer like a steadycam merlin. The LCD only consumed slightly more battery compared to the viewfinder, so I ran it on LCD all the time.  The battery that comes with the camera is good for 4hrs of shooting, I tend to shoot less than that, so I could recharge every day. But I did carry some after market extended batteries just in case.I use Linux (Ubuntu 11.10), plugged in the camera via USB and it all 3 internal storage drives cleanly mounted, if you mount via usb copying can be slow, if you have an SD card reader you can read the contents directly from the card to your computer much faster, the camera lets you copy internal memory to card in slot B, so once you copied all your data from the SD, you can copy the contents of the internal memory by 1st copying it to SD and then copying to you computer.  Since the video was shot in 24p, you have to remove pulldown from the video, mencoder utility in linux can be used to remove pulldown, infact I am converting all my video into H.264 format. Conversion speed is depended on your computer, I have a X86 i5 with 8GB ram, WD 3T HDD, and 1GB of raw data takes 55minutes to convert to H.264 format at (4400 variable bitrate, lower bitrate will be faster but less quality). I have not even opened the packaging on the software that came with the camera, it is useless to me anyway.Pros:* SSD based, 32GB internal + 2 slots for SD cards, lots of space for recording very HD video at 24p* Light weight, ergonomic, easy access buttons.* Lens hood is a great add cuts glare* Is compatible with filters you already have for 58mm lens.* In cinema mode, Filter 2 the colors are stunning, skin tones slightly reddish under certain lights. Filter 1 gives very good skin tones* Very good LCD screen, consumes less power.* Comes with all the cables, remote including mini HDMI.Cons:* Copying data via USB is slow* relay recording needs to be set each time you power on/off camera coz it does not save that in memory.* noticed some gel wobble when shooting on the move (fast pace walk)* slight vignetting at 100% wide angle (normal for wide angle lenses), a little zoom will fix that.* Audio recorded is slightly tinny, an external mic could make it sound a lot better.Overall I love this camera, friends and relatives said my videos looks like it was taken with a movie camera, and the colors are stunning.", "This Canon Vixia HF G10 is a great little video camera and produces professional results. I'll share with you some of my observations:BACKGROUND:As the marketing and branding director of a large solar company, I was tasked with finding a good camera we could use to make promo commercials/videos at an affordable cost. We didn't want to spend $8,000 on a camera or pay $8,000 for someone to do the video for us, yet at the same time, we didn't want to buy a cheap $500 camera and get crappy results. So this was the one we chose and I think we made a good choice.MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS:First, the manual adjustments make this a breeze to work with. I can set the maximum level for the mic input (great when using wireless lavalier mic packs), can set the white balance to a custom level for unique lighting situations, and so on.POWERED IS:One thing I want to clarify is that this camera DOES have the powered image stabilization (Powered IS). I have seen multiple reviews of this camera around the internet where it says the Powered IS is not an included option... it is and it works great.LENS SIZE:The most noticeable difference between this camera and some of the lower end Canon Vixia's is the size of the lens. This is a full-size 58mm Canon lens, not the tiny little ones found on most other consumer grade Canon video cameras. This of course produces much better image quality as we've seen in side-by-side tests with our Canon Vixia HF S200. Another noticeable improvement with this lens is it's wider than previous generations, allowing you to use it indoors with ease and without worry about not getting an entire room in a shot.INCLUDED BATTERY:The included battery is a joke and won't even last a full hour of recording. Luckily, 3rd party manufacturers sell the extended batteries at a very affordable price, right here on Amazon. I believe the extended battery we purchased was only about $25 and provides up to 300 minutes of recording. The extended Canon battery costs over $100 and produces the same results.SDXC:Another bonus with this camera is its ability to support SDXC cards. The older generation Vixia's were limited to SDHC cards and with the HD recording options of this camera, SDXC gives peac of mind that you won't ever hit the camera's buffer during recording.I'll update this review as we continue to use the camera and will provide feedback for those looking into buying this camera. What I can say, however, is that this is definitely the best pro-sumer grade video camera Canon has produced to date and I don't think you can go wrong purchasing it.", "\"I guess I was one of the lucky few who was able to get this camera early. I got mine 2 weeks ago and have been nothing but impressed with it. Right out of the box and in a medium lit interior room the picture was superb. I got a chance to take it out in the field for a bit and am extremely happy with it. Full manual control, a focus ring, an awesome and absolutely beautiful touch screen, what more could you ask for?I especially appreciate the dual SD card slots and the recording options there. There are certainly going to be times where you'll want to record to 2 cards at once and that will come in handy. But the ability to also record to the internal memory and then copy the contents to one of the SD cards in the card slots is also a great option.The other things that are not mentioned in a lot of the bullet points for this camera that I am impressed with include the waveform monitor and peaking meters which come in handy for the manual exposure and focus modes. It also does zebra stripes so you have many options to get the perfect shots without relying merely on what you see through the viewfinder or on screen. Also, when you focus, by default, it automatically magnifies the center of the screen so that you can tell exactly what is in focus. Of course that can also be turned off if it is not your preference.It is not a very large or very heavy camcorder either. That was my only reservation at first because I tend to prefer bulkier and heavier cameras. However this thing is so perfectly balanced in the hand and so rugged feeling that I am not concerned at all with the weight now.I ordered 2 64GB SDXC cards with mine and at full resolution video recording it is reporting around 14 hours of recording time. Awesome! I also purchased the BP-827 battery, though I had plenty of recording time out in the field with just the standard battery as well.Hope that helps anyone who might be on the fence about buying this one. If you have a model from last year then you may not need to upgrade yet. But it was definitely time for me to ditch the tapes and upgrade from my Canon HV30 and I am glad I did!Update - June 21, 2011I was able to take this camera on a trip last month to San Francisco, Napa Valley and Carmel by the Sea. The footage is simply amazing - but I did notice a couple of issues that I want to share with others who might purchase this camera.Issue 1) The camera uses \"\"dynamic IS\"\" for image stabilization by default in both auto and manual modes. It does not appear that you can change this in auto mode but you can in manual mode (and this is a prosumer camera so you shouldn't really use auto mode anyway) and I highly recommend that you change this. Use \"\"standard IS\"\" instead because dynamic IS tends to give you a wobble effect around the edges of your video. Google it for this camera and you'll see lots of youtube videos and threads on forums about it. It is a non-issue if you just stick with the Standard IS and we're still waiting to see if Canon fixes this in a firmware update.Issue 2) This is not as big of an issue but I did notice that there is a bit of vignetting going on with the lens that appears to be just when I have the lens hood on and at full zoom. It's a shadow effect around the edges. I recommend just using the lens hood when you really need it and only when you know you won't be zooming in full as much.I still maintain the 5 stars at this point because these are little things that you can easily get around and the wobble issue could likely be fixed by Canon soon anyway. It is one of those things that you deal with as an early purchaser and I have no regrets about buying this camera regardless. The footage I have made with this camera so far is absolutely stunning!\"", "\"I am a very experienced Amateur videographer. I shoot a lot of video but have never had any formal training or education relative to photography. I bought my first contemporary camcorder 7 years ago and it was a standard definition Canon. It was inexpensive and the image quality reflected that. Regardless of the standard definition, it had trouble focusing anytime I panned the camera, even slowly. It did have one feature that I found delightful ... programmable zoom. I could set it either fast or slow and it would zoom at a fixed rate no matter how far or quickly I moved the zoom lever. It was great.Then 5 years ago when HD camcorders came down in price a bit I bought a really nice Sony HDR-UX10. The image quality was spectacular, the touch screen very nice and menu intuitive. The 20X optical zoom was awesome. Today, they sell used on Amazon for nearly what I paid for it so you can see it was a great camera. However, it did not have a programmable zoom and the zoom lever was so short that even the slightest movement (or as best I could produce) caused the camera to zoom much too rapidly. I got dizzy watching my own videos. Indoor footage with standard indoor lighting was dull and grainy 99% of the time. The LCD screen was relatively small and even at its brightest, was very hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight conditions. The Sony micro-SD memory cards were the most expensive in the market and the cheaper after-market cards came from China and had compatibility issues.Then I saw the Vixia HF G10 on sale. Canon had just come out with a newer version and dropped the price on this by nearly 40% so I somehow managed to convince my wife to spend $1045 on a new camera. I'm really glad I did. Aside from the awesome 1080p image quality (standard HD), here's what I like about the Vixia ....1) Programmable Zoom ... not only can you set the zoom rate at various rates, you can also set it to buffer itself ... meaning you can set it to start zooming slowly, then automatically speeds up to the set rate and then automatically decelerates as it reaches the end of the zoom range. You can also set it in reverse order if you wish also. There are other adjustments you can make to the zoom such as setting the start and stop points as well. I also like that you can set one rate to zoom on the camera lever as well as a different rate using the hand held remote zoom buttons.2) Large 3.5 inch LCD screen is so much easier to distinguish detail than the 2.8 inch Sony. It's also a higher resolution screen that is much brighter but still a bit washed out in direct sunlight. I've ordered a nice hood for it to shade the screen for $25 incl shipping.3) Some reviews have issue with the difficulty they have with the required pressure needed to navigate the touch screen menus. It was noticeably different than the Sony but took me about and hour to completely recalibrate my brain and it's not the least bit difficult for me now ... not an issue for me at all.4) Menu navigation is pretty intuitive although it is organized in a peculiar way. It's not any more difficult than the Sony menu system and although some reviews had an issue with it, I didn't have much trouble figuring out most of the functions I needed for 90% of my needs. Granted there are things in there I don't understand, but that's because the camera has features I've never seen before.5) Another thing I really like about the camera is the low light performance. The larger sensors and lens collecting more light actually work the way it is described. The same indoor footage is about 100% better than the Sony footage. Video shot in the living room with a single 60watt energy efficient flouresant (domed ceiling fan light) looks awesome ... not as good as outdoors by any means but totally acceptable. Video I shot in the church windowless gymnasium was beautiful.6) The camera appears to be larger than the Sony. However, it fits more comfortably in my hand and is more ergonomical with better access and feel to controls. It also feels lighter to me.7) The 32Gb hard-drive and 2 SD slots capable of each running 64Gb cards is way more memory than I'll ever need. The Sony by comparison had an 8Gb card with a battery that lasted 1 hour, forty-five minutes. I would usually download to my laptop and charge the camera every night when we were travelling. Now I can go several days without doing anything .... I purchased a Wasabi after-market battery for $25 that has nearly a 6 hour capacity. I charged the after-market battery as instructed in the manual and the camera recognizes the \"\"remaining battery time\"\" perfectly (some reviews of the battery claimed the camera didn't recognize it correctly). They just didn't charge it correctly.8) The lens is noticeably wider than the Sony lens and just seems to frame everything much better. The lens \"\"hood\"\" works well to keep reflections from around the lens from entering the camera ... something the Sony had a small issue with.9) In \"\"Auto\"\" mode, the camera automatically switches to different combinations of settings to optimize specific conditions, such as night-time, sunsets, fireworks etc. In \"\"Manual\"\" mode, you can set aperture and shutter speed yourself to get the image you are looking for although I am not proficient enough to take advantage of these features. In \"\"Auto\"\" mode, the sunset videos I've shot are much more beautiful than the Sony ever was. The Sony had trouble balancing the difference between the brightness of the remaining sun versus the darkening background while the Vixia seems to capture the best of both environments.10) Simply by touching something on the screen, the camera will remember the object selected and follow it, keeping it in focus no matter how you move the camera.11) The digital stabilization system works noticeably better than the Sony. It's alway hard to keep a steady image when shooting by hand and fully zoomed in. The Canon isn't perfect here but still better than I experienced with the Sony (it may have been that the Sony just had a longer zoom).Other considerations ..... the Canon Vixia has a full manual mode with a manual focus ring like an SLR. I've played with it a little but not enough to make any intelligent comments. The Sony by comparison had some manual capabilities but I was never able to interpret the functionality. The Vixia also has options to change the frame rates including a \"\"Cinema\"\" mode which shoots at 24 fps instead of 30. It's supposed to create the feel of a theatre cinema experience but I haven't actually tried it yet. There are several \"\"Effects\"\" modes which are like templates used for various effects like B&W;, Sepia etc. These have always seemed \"\"gimmicky\"\" to me and do more to detract from a video than enhance it (this is obviously a very subjective point of view) but others may enjoy their usage.Now for the things that disappoint me somewhat ....1) The 10X Optical zoom is half that of the Sony and it shows. I can't bring in those smaller objects way off in the distance. I don't care for the benefits of adding the digital zoom levels as it just feels like a compromise to me (never needed it with the Sony). I'm giving up something to get something else.2) The stereo microphone built into the camera reproduces sound nicely .... however .... even with the wind noise suppression \"\"ON\"\", the slightest breeze destroys the audio. It was the exact same with the Sony so I haven't given up anything but I'm still disappointed. I'm going to try covering the inputs with some sort of foam and see if it helps.3) The Vixia has a standard \"\"lens cap\"\" like any SLR or still camera. Not really a design flaw or detractant, but still something I find annoying as I'm not used to dealing with one (the Sony has the auto-iris cover which opens and closes on start up and shut down). I've misplaced the cap several times and am planning on thethering it to the lens hood at some time in the near future.So far, I am really loving the new Canon. I'm sure as I learn to use more of its features and experiment a little more, I will love it that much more. I have 2 YouTube channels and have posted some videos shot this year (2013) with the Vixia including my \"\"First Impression\"\" created the first 15 minutes I used the camera the day I got it. The videos shown ahead of that video are all shot with the Canon, the videos following that video are all shot with the Sony (if you care to compare). You can do a search on You Tube for \"\"Travels with Yoly\"\" to find them.Oh  yes, one more thing ... I bought a Polaroid UV filter for the camera as some had suggested in reviews to protect the lens and limit UV entering the camera. It was a fraction of the cost of the Canon filter and worth every penny ... I say this in jest as the quality was on par with its \"\"cheapness\"\". I guess it's true what they say about camera lenses ... you get what you pay for. Spend the additional money if you need additional lenses.\"", "This Camera is Very good.I am very happy with its video quality,it is like having a very expensive pro camera in small size I would recommend this.", "\"Incredible quality and function set for a camcorder of this size and price range. The \"\"SD\"\" format IS readable on MY 2011 Mac. Even SDXC cards are plug and play. Plug in the SD card and iMovie automatically shows the import window with ALL clips shown ready to select and import. Direct USB connection works the same way. LOVE this camcorder so far!\"", "After plenty of debate on which camcorder to buy, finally decided to go with the HF G10. Reason for purchasing this one in specific was because I was tired of buying the same old regular cameras (non HD) and not enough manual settings. I'm a semi pro photographer and just as I like my cameras with lots of manual stuff, I wanted the same out of my camcorder.The menu is super user friendly, recording is a breeze, and after using it a few times, I really like the quality of the footage I'm getting. Without going into too much detail and not having that much knowledge on professional camcorders, the HF G10 gives me FANTASTIC HD quality without having to spend $3,000 and up. I really like it.Only thing I would add is that Canon should have a specific instruction manual on its own included that gives a step by step on how to download footage on a computer. It's there in the manual but you have to dig for it, as opposed to a pamphlet that just simplifies it for you."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00018234664457850158, 0.1803613156080246, 0.0001607886515557766, 0.0009982052724808455, 0.2689562141895294, 0.006726722698658705, 0.05209963768720627, 0.003884243546053767, 0.004325693007558584, 0.00013135503104422241, 0.25556668639183044, 0.22369088232517242, 0.0029158787801861763]]}
