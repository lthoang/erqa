I have a Jeep Wrangler, which is difficult to hear a speakerphone, but sometimes I don't always like to stream music.  I would have expected to be able to have FM mode ready for a call, whether I was streaming or not.You fell short, Jabra.  Big disappointment.", "\"I have been using this hands free Bluetooth for a few weeks now. Having a newborn in the car I will not hold the cell phone up to my ear, I will only use Bluetooth speakerphones.I have always been impressed with Jabra products. I have one of their in ear Bluetooth's and it is the best one I have for blocking out noise and for voice clarity. However, when I received this I was certain it would not compare to myBlueAnt Supertooth Light Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black)that I have had for a few years. I was convinced no other speakerphone was better for the car. After all it sounded great, never received complaints, and took it in the house to charge when needed.With that said I was interested to try this device thinking it would not compare to what I already had, boy, I was wrong! First of all when you turn on the Jabra the power button is on the side. Right away a lady's voice states to turn your cell phone into discovery mode. It states to enter the universal pin of 0000 but that was not needed on my phone. Within seconds my cell phone was paired! Right away the device automatically downloads the phone book from your cell phone. Once this is done and you power it off then on, the unit makes a chime and states you are \"\"connected\"\" so you know you have a connection. I believe you can turn off the blue light on the Jabra to show it is connected, however I like having it on. It is not a distracting while driving and is a solid light. When you receive a call the voice states the number that is calling. It is not hard to miss. To accept the call simply hit the phone icon in the center. Speak as desired and you have the option to turn the volume up or down on the top left and right. Very simple but yet very nicely designed. I love how loud the calls get and the clarity of the calls and the voice built into the phone. When your call is over simply hit the phone icon again. When you power off the unit it states it is \"\"powering off\"\". It is great since you probably will be in the car while using this and if you forget if you did an action on the phone you have the automated voice to let you know you have.Compared to my Blueant, which I thought was the best one out there, this one blows it out of the water! The benefits over my Blueant are as follows:- To turn the Blueant on you would have to slide the microphone out and you would have to remember to slid it back in to power it off. With the Jabra if you forget to power it off it goes into a standby mode!- The Blueant has the annoying flashing blue light to let you know you are connected when the blue light on the Jabra is solid and not interference for me.- The Blueant does not have the automated voice commands letting you know you are connected, if it is powered on and off, etc. I find this so helpful with the Jabra. Even though I know I have hit a button to hear a woman's recorded voice telling me what action is taking place is reassuring.Size wise it is perfect! I debated whether or not I would like that the clip was built into the unit since my Blueant has a magnet you place on the visor. I find the Jabra to be easier since it is all built in and prevents the device from getting lost to the main unit unlike my Bluetooth.I cannot speak for the low battery indicator since it has not run low and I also bring it in the house to charge it through my USB port on my computer every night and like habit, take it out to my car along with my cell phone now. I will say my Blueant does not have a low battery indicator so I have no idea when it is running low.All in all the one I loved (Blueant) and thought I could not find a better speakerphone for my car, this one has proven to be the best! I have learned my Blueant is really outdated or Jabra is very advanced. Regardless Jabra is my favorite and I did not think that was possible. Call wise I have had no complaints. I use it a lot on the interstate with a newborn in the backseat and nobody has said they cannot hear me or any interference from the traffic. It does have a small delay sometimes and gets silent but that is worth it for the clarity this speakerphone has.In the past I would not have bought a Jabra speakerphone since I was so hooked on the Blueant.  But after a Bluetooth headset and now this top of the line speakerphone I think they are the brand I will be picking out in the future. I liked it so much I bought my elderly mother one since she transports my daughter and I did not want her fumbling for the phone anymore, especially with my daughter in the car. I am very impressed; enough I got it for my mother and will recommend it to others.\"", "I didn't have a good experience with Jabra before. My first unit (wireless bluetooth headset) died after not being used for a year so I was really skeptic with this one.Hardware wise, very well built, weight is just right (so as not to feel plasticky if too light). Metal grill for the speaker and some led indicators. There's a clip beneath for the visor and touch sensitive buttons. I like the cigarette lighter charger included, feels durable.Initial setup was a breeze. All pairing is done via the phone and there's a voice guided setup, the unit tells you what to do. After that, all calls can be done via the unit.Charging leds tell you the status and then it takes 3 to 4 hours to fully charged (in my case though). The included usb cable isn't long enough to keep the unit plugged in when mounted to the visor.Overall a good product, didn't give 5 stars because the usb cable was too short. Nothing is perfect =D.", "My wife and I find this extremely useful for making calls while in the car. I haven't received any complaints about the audio quality from the person on the other line, either. Occasionally, searching for a station to use is annoying, but I blame FM radio signals rather than Jabra for this.", "Terrific unit, slim and grips well to my car visor and easy to pair/connect to my phone.  FM transmitter allows songs, GPS and conversations to be heard through my car stereo.  No complaints from folks on the other end.  Easy to use, good quality sound.  A little pricey, since the Plantronics K100 is cheaper and reviews rate it just as nice.  Considered the BlueAnt S4 because of easy voice control, but no FM transmitter on that one.  Wish this one was cheaper, but no complaints of any kind.  Does a good job.", "I am very impressed with this speaker.  The sound quality is very good on both ends.  The pairing to my phone was very easy.  It looks nice and well  built, and the controls are conveniently located and easy to use.  The battery life is very good.  I have been using this speaker for the last three days on single charge and the low battery indicator still have not lit up.  This speaker uses a micro-USB connector for charging, the same as my BB 8900, which is very convenient.  Also, the package does not include a wall charger, but included a car power adapter with a USB female socket, so you can charge any device that uses USB charger (e.g. MP3 player, cell phone, Flip camcorder).  The speaker has no screen, and all of the setup is voice guided.There are a few things that could have worked better though.  First, the FM transmitter, just did not seem practical.  It picks up interference and I gave up after a couple of tries.  I searched for a frequency that seemed clear of any radio signal and set the transmitter to that frequency, but as soon as I started driving, some hissing started to come and go.  I tried another frequency, and again, it was clear initially but as soon as I started moving, it started to pick up interference.  Second, I do not like the computer generated female voice that gives commands in Jabra Cruiser2, I've definitely heard better computer generated voices in other devices (e.g. Blackberry, Plantronics 975).  Third, I could not charge the speaker from a computer's USB port, it does not seem to get enough power from a computer, it sat charging on my desk for four hours and the battery indicator did not turn green.  This is upsetting because I wanted to recharge the speaker at work and could not.  Since it did not come with a wall adapter, the car charger is the only option, but it is impractical to use while driving because you will have a wire extending from the power adapter to the visor, which can be a nuisance.  This is an inconvenience for me, and I am considering getting a micro-USB wall charger to keep at work.Even considering all the small issues I experienced, this is still a great device that I find to be more convenient than a bluetooth headset.", "Hands down, this is the best visor style car Bluetooth device you can buy. Call clarity is crisp and the volume is never an issue. Callers can never tell when I'm on it. I haven't tested with the windows down, but really, do yourself a courtesy for callers and roll them up during a call. Battery life is also pretty incredible. I've owned mine for about a year now and have charged it 2-3 times. Seriously. I'm not a road warrior but I'm sure with heavy useage you'd still get quite a long time out of one charge. The only negative I can think of is that the FM feature really sucks. Fuzzy and muffled no matter what different channel I choose. So if that's a big feature for you, then skip this one. But to be honest, I've never had a device that does FM transmitting well.Pro's:BATTERY LIFEVOLUMECALL CLARITYPORTABILITYSLIMPRICECon's:FM TRANSMITTER ISN'T GREAT", "\"I having been using theParrot Minikit Bluetooth Speakerphonefor a couple years now and thought that was \"\"as good as it gets\"\".  The Jabra CRUISER2 has open new doors for me!  I am extremely impressed with on how clear and loud I can be heard, even with my window slightly opened.  At first I found myself yelling at the speaker until I was too that I was too loud and hurting their ears.  I then lowered my voice to a normal talking level and I was still heard clearly as if I was standing right next to the person.  I have been even told that I sound better speaking on the Jabra Speakerphone than on my actual cellphone itself - now that's impressive!I am using it with my Motorola Droid smartphone.  Pairing was so simple, it did not even ask for the pin code.  A female voice talks you through the steps.  It was up and running in seconds.  During the initial setup, all my contacts transferred to the unit.  However, when I am receiving a call it does not announce the callers names, instead it announces the digits of their phone number.  All functions answer/end call, redial and voice dial)are pretty much done using one button, the call button.  The unit is slim and small but I wish the bracket was shorter or constructed differently.  The length of the bracket is pretty long.  Since it is so long I can not place it in the middle of my sun-visor because it interferes with the hard plastic cover lighted mirror.  Because of this, I have to clip the it to the end of the visor, which makes it difficult to see and use the buttons on the side of the unit.In regards to transmitting the call through your radio, it has it's good and bad points. I find that the FM button is too small and difficult to find since it sits n the side on the speakerphone.  Maybe if it was placed on the front of the unit it would of been easier to turn on.  It is hard to find a station without any static, but you can easily tune to different frequencies by using the volume up and down buttons while in FM mode.  I have mine set to 88.3.  I live in a very rural area and no radio stations use that frequency.  If I have the volume turned down at a normal level (medium-low) I can not hear the caller clearly.  If I have the volume turned up higher, I then hear constant static in the background.  I don't believe this is any fault of Jabra, it is just the frequencies I can only use in my area.  Even though I can hear a faint static using the FM transmitter, I prefer to use it instead of just using the CRUISER2 speakers.  The speaker volume on the CRUISER2 is not as loud as I would like it to be.One great feature is that I do not have to turn the unit off manually.  Once I end a call and walk out of my vehicle, the unit will turn itself in standby position (no lights) after 10 minutes.  Once I go back in my truck, all I have to do is hit the call button and it is back up and ready for use. Battery life is quite long.Overall, I give it 4 stars for it's ability to allow callers to hear me loud and clear without screaming.  It loses 1 star for the unit's lack of adjusting or changing the clip-on bracket, as well as the placement of the FM and ON/Off buttons.Make sure to visit Jabra's website for more information and instructions.UPDATE:  It has been 4 weeks since I have had recharged the unit, and it is still going strong.  On average I have been using least 90 minutes a day on talk time and an average of 2 hours in standby (on) mode .\"", "\"I've used this unit for several weeks now and I have to say that I am really impressed.  I've used Bluetooth devices for years and this one is by far the best.Originally I'd used a Motorola single ear Bluetooth earpiece and then several Jabra single ear headsets but I always had the following problems:They were never loud enough for me.  I would struggle with hearing, and would have to press the earpieces continuously into my ear to understand what was being said -so much for hands free driving! Plus, the earpieces, obviously, only provided sound to ONE ear.  I don't know about you, but if I had a choice I'd rather not have something in my ear, and would rather use both ears to listen.Additionally, some of the ear pieces were afflicted with echoes or delays, and I'd have to ask the other person to repeat what they said so that I'd understand.Another problem was that when I would take the earpiece out of the car and transport it in my pocket, it would often fall out (because it would get hooked on the pocket and then bump loose and fall).  I lost two that way, and ruined one by letting my clothes go through the wash with an earpiece inside.  (Well, it actually worked after the wash, but you get my drift...)The most annoying thing, however, was that I had to charge it often or it would start beeping, and I would have to do so regularly, which was a pain.  I ended up charging it every night (along with my phone) just so I wouldn't forget.So THEN I went to using my GPS which had Bluetooth capability built in.  This was a HUGE step up over using the in ear headset.  However, that also had two issues.  First was that there was sometimes background noise.  When going 65 mph in the car the road noise would sometimes muffle the conversation on the other end.  Second, the GPS speaker, though appropriately situated for the GPS device, was not in the best location for hearing calls.  It was on the BACK of the GPS (which makes sense because the GPS screen is in front), and I would hear conversations that would first have to bounce off the front window and then come back to me -not the most direct route.  And third, and most annoyingly, every time I left the car the GPS would deactivate and I'd have to go into my phone's settings to re-pair with the GPS device.  This took about 30 seconds and was not something I liked to do when driving! (At first I thought it was an issue with my phone, but when I got the Jabra Cruiser In Car Speakerphone I no longer had this issue...)So FINALLY I got the Jabra Cruiser In Car Speakerphone and all my other issues went away.  No longer was I losing my Bluetooth ear piece while walking, no longer was I losing that tiny thing in the wash, no longer did I struggle with hearing others, no longer did others struggle hearing me.  Additionally, quite unlike with my GPS Bluetooth, my Jabra was located perfectly -about 12 inches directly above my head -which did not block my view at all, and provided the optimal microphone location.  Also, the people I call with my GPS now say that my calls are clearer, and I can hear them even better as well.  Instead of a small speaker on the back of my GPS (about the size of a nickel) I now have a speaker the size of a half dollar on the FRONT of my speakerphone and right above my head.It really is like night and day with this device.  I can hear things more cleanly, and the device has better volume controls, AND the person on the other end has no trouble at all hearing me.And, there are some other great things about this device.  First, it pairs AUTOMATICALLY every time after the first time.  Now, when I get into the car and turn the device on it speaks to me and says something like \"\"DEVICE ON\"\".  Then, a few seconds later it indicates (verbally) that it is now paired with my phone.  I never need to struggle with my phone settings when I get in the car.  I never have to find my phone when it is ringing to try to connect it to my GPS.  Now it auto rings and I can answer it by pushing a button right above my head without even finding my phone.Also, just like with a GPS you can charge the speaker system directly in the car.  You plug in the included mini-USB car charging cable directly to your device and you never need to take it out of the car to charge it elsewhere.  And, once charged (by indication of a green light coming on) you can then unplug the device and use it for many hours before it needs charging again.And finally, this speaker system will work with TWO phones.  When either me or my wife goes on an errand in the car (and the device is turned on) the system will automatically pair with both of our phones.  (Haven't tried both of us getting calls at the same time, though -I imagine THAT wouldn't work.)Love this product.  LOVE IT!\"", "Good quality Bluetooth In-Car / Portable Speakerphone.  Call quality while driving seems good - make sure you charge it before first use.  There was a firmware update on the Jubra website I downloaded and installed when I first got the device - no way to tell which firmware was shipped with the device (there has only been one update in may 5, 2012) so I installed per instructions - have to connect via its mini USB Cable to your PC and enable USB connection mode.[...]Easy to use and much safer when driving then using a blue-tooth ear piece.  Not tried the FM Transmitter feature although finding a clear FM channel here in Atlanta would be difficult.", "\"I own the Motorola T505 and the Jabra Cruiser2.  It made sense to me to take a little road test and compare the two bluetooth speakerphones in an effort to determine which one is better.  With my mom on the other end, I took to the local freeways and switched back and forth between the two units while mom told me what she was hearing on her end of the conversation.Form: The Jabra Cruiser2 is attractive.  It is lightweight but has a solid feel to it.  Controls are simple to use and understand.  The unit's design is understated and minimalist.  A clip holds the Cruiser2 to your car's sun visor.  Unfortunately, the Jabra's clip cannot be reversed.  My car, an Audi, has sun visors that flip from front to rear, rather than the usual rear to front configuration.  That means that I cannot use the Jabra Cruiser2 unless I mount it backwards.  Conversely, the Motorola T505's clip allows the unit to be reversed, which gives one more mounting flexibility.Setup: Pairing the Jabra Cruiser2 was quick and simple.  A woman with a pleasant voice provides pairing instructions and also tells you quite clearly what's going on with the unit.  My cell phone is a Palm Treo 755p, which was the model that came out just before the Palm Pre.  For whatever reason, the Cruiser2 is apparently unable to download the directory from my phone.  So when a call comes in, it simply announces the number rather than the name of the caller.  I'm guessing this won't be a problem for most, as it's probably a simple incompatability between my cell phone and the Cruiser2.Function:  I used both the Jabra and Motorola units by listening through the internal speaker and I also used the FM transmitter function.  The sound quality of the Jabra Cruiser2 is superior to the audio quality of the Motorola T505 when using its internal speaker.  It's internal speaker seems to be larger, clearer and has a better volume output than the Motorolas.According to mom, the microphone quality was similar between the two units.  However, she felt that the Jabra's audio output was more \"\"choppy\"\" than the Motorola's.When I use a bluetooth speakerphone, I usually set it to output to FM stereo.  It is there that the Motorola has a clear advantage over the Jabra.  I heard consistent background noise and static from the Jabra Cruiser2 where much less interference was heard from the Motorola T505.  Several times, FM radio stations overpowered the Jabra's FM output.  Yes, I clearly understand that the goal is to operate on a frequency where no FM station is broadcasting and I tried to do that.  But the Jabra's FM transmitter did not seem up to the task.  I'd rate it poorly with respect to it's FM output function.Conclusion: There are things to like about the Jabra Cruiser2 and things not to like.  It's appearance is sharp, setup is a breeze, and it's simple to operate.  Audio quality and volume using the internal speaker is clear and relatively loud.  But I'm frankly quite unhappy with the FM output of this unit.I was torn as to whether to rate this unit 2 stars or 3 but I gave Jabra the benefit of the doubt with a 3 star rating.  However, I don't expect to use the Cruiser2 much, if at all, because the poor FM transmitter is a deal breaker to me.  So, if you're planning on using the Cruiser2 by utilizing its internal speaker, I think that you'll be satisfied with its performance.  If you want to listen to calls and music using your car's stereo speakers, I'd skip this unit and instead consider the Motorola or a different bluetooth speakerphone with stronger FM output.\"", "this is one of the nicest bluetooth devices i have ever usedthe step by step voice instructions step u through the whole setup process easilyit imports your cellphone address book and through this feature it lets u know who is calling you, saving you from looking at caller ID while drivingIt holds a charge for 3 weeks (i shut it off when not in use ).i can hear it ring over my music,etc.most people say the voice quality is better than my actual cell phonein a pinch u can use it as a speaker phone in your housethe only change in the design i would make is with the power switch, as my wife some times has a hard time moving it. i would make it a rocker switch instead of a slider Also it would be easier with gloves to switch  and in this part of the US ,thats about 6months out of the year :0)", "I received this as a birthday present and like it better than a different one I'd previously purchased.The set-up was incredibly easy.  Charge it up, turn it on, go to the appropriate setting on your phone and choose this device.  My phone contacts transferred over so when the phone rings, the speakerphone announces the name.  I find the sound quality to be fairly good.  There is a slight bit of static, but I haven't found it distracting or interferring.  I'm told my voice comes across well to the other people.I like the fact that this has a mute button on it and the other buttons are easy to see, and that the device lays flat against my visor.My cell phone isn't used a lot, so the fact that it won't have to be charged for almost 3 weeks is a definite plus.You do get a car charger with it and the port on the device is on the side, not the back like another one I had.The only thing that would make this better would be the ability to make calls via verbal command.  Ok, that's not something I have on my current flip phone either.My state has just passed a hand-held cell phone ban, so this will keep me legal.", "These are great! They not only pair with our phones easily, but retransmit it in FM to the car and truck sound systems. Most folks are shocked to hear we are on a speakerphone in the car. And they play all the music on our phone's 32GB micro SD card. They are mounted with a spring clip to the driver's sun visor securely. I can flip the visor down as needed and the Jabra works fine. When a call comes in it automatically pauses the music and I can answer it by pressing it on my visor and end a call the same way. No fumbling with a touch screen or having to look away while driving. I have three. One for each of our cars, and one for my truck. I like my music, no commercials.  It also shuts down if you leave and it senses the phone is gone for ten minutes. Then when you want to use it again you have to flip the switch back to the off position and turn it on again for it to wake up. I try to remember to turn it off when  I leave the car, but forget sometimes. The rechargeable battery in them lasts for weeks of half hour trips every day. They charge with the same micro USB our phones and tablets use so we can leave them in the car or truck on the always on charger outlet when needed or bring them in the house.  But the charging circuit in the Cruisers turn off when it is fully charged so you won't run a battery down or over charge it. I had the original Jabra which changed tracks of the music which I have set to shuffle and repeat. This one won't let me skip a track from the controls on it or I missed it.  But still the best solution out there IMHO.", "The Jabra Cruiser2 bluetooth speakerphone allows you to talk completely hands-free while in the care.  Clipped to your visor, it acts as both a bluetooth speakerphone as well as an FM transmitter that allows you to hear music from your phone via your car stereo.Setup was very easy - just follow the voice prompts once you turn on the unit.  It paired effortlessly to two different phones in minutes.  The Cruiser2 also can sync your phonebook entries so that it can announce who is calling.  Using it was similarly simple thanks to the uncluttered controls:  volume up/down, connect, and power on/off.Sound quality was good, but cost the unit a star in my review.  Callers indicated that I sounded clear enough to be understood, but that there was also enough background noise to give away that I was on a speakerphone (vs. a bluetooth headset, for example).  FM transmission of music to my car's stereo was mediocre, but I considered this functionality an add-on, so it didn't count that against it very much.The Cruiser2 comes with a car charger, which is actually a great option vs. yet another home charger cluttering up the junk drawer in your kitchen.  This means that it will always be available for use one way or another - great for those who spend a lot of time on the road.  Battery life has been very good - several hours between each short charge.The Cruiser2 is highly recommended for someone who spends a lot of time on the road and needs to talk while there (and isn't too worried about others hearing the usual speakerphone ambiance).  Sound quality is on par with what you would expect from an office speakerphone.  It is easy to use and ergonomically-designed during every phase of operation, from initial pairing to the button interface to the included car charger.", "\"I'm using this with a Sony Ericsson C905a.Construction Quality:  The unit feels great.  It's nice and solid, with satisfying weight.  It clips on my visor with the wire that doubles as the FM transmitter (clever!) and just feels and looks nice.Setup: Pairing the device was as simple as a bluetooth headset. A robotic voice comes on when you first turn on the Jabra, walking you through the process.  That same voice informed you that it has downloaded your phone book.  To connect another phone, just hold down the phone button and the voice repeats the process.  Easiest pairing I've ever experienced.  The bluetooth will enunciate the names of incoming callers if they are in your phonebook.  Setting up the FM transmitter to work was trivially easy.  You hit a button on the side marked \"\"FM\"\" and the robot voice tells you the frequency to tune into (and a radio icon lights up).  You can hit the + or - and the voice will announce a new frequency (these same keys control volume if you aren't using the FM mode).Performance:  The built in speaker is loud, but I much prefer using the FM transmitter.  I'm really pleased with the noise cancellation.  It's not perfect, but it is much easier to hear, and my wife says I'm easier to hear when I'm talking into this thing.  The AD2P -> FM transmitter is a great bonus because my phone has a lot of music on it.  The music sounds good, not great (you need a line in for better quality).  Honestly, this is probably the biggest surprise for me because I usually hate FM transmitters.  Bluetooth reception is also much better than the headsets I'm used to, probably because this device is a little bigger.  I can leave my phone in my pocket and make and receive calls.Battery Life:  I have to be honest, I have only tested this for several hours at once between charging.  It has been 'on' for 8 hours and handled at least 3 hours of talking without any problems for me, but I don't know how much longer it can last (I suspect much longer).  I think I'll be better informed on how well the battery holds up after I've had it for a few months (I'll update this review).  The device charges from a USB Micro cable and comes with a car charger adapter.\"", "More and more cars are coming with bluetooth integrated in them.  Unfortunately having bought my car before those gadgets existed, I didn't get to have this nice integration.  Now there are a series of products that make it easy to do so.The in-car speakerphones seem to have many of the same features.  Essentially a device that you can pair your phone to via bluetooth, and then talk to people through it.  This device even has an FM transmitter, when this is enabled, and your radio tuned, the call audio comes through your speakers (mics are still used on the device itself).What I liked specifically about this device is that it has a physical on-off switch.  Instead of having to hold something down, and wait for it, I simply reach up and flip the switch.  Few seconds later it's connected and I'm talking.  I also like that the 'phone' button and power button are separated, in other ones I've used they are not, and if you accidentally hold the button too long it turns off..whoops.The battery has lasted well for me, although I'm just a few hours in (supposedly 14 hours total talk time).  Otherwise recharging will be a pain, but if I only have to do it once a month or once every few months, it's hardly an issue.The FM transmitter so far has been a little staticy, but that's mostly because I haven't taken the time to find a completely empty frequency.  This device also pairs using Bluetooth A2DP, which means if you use the FM transmitter you can send music from your smartphone (or other A2DP device) to your radio.  Combined with voice control, this makes for a good/easy way to play music.When you first connect your phone to the device it pulls your phone book down, it then uses this to figure out who's calling and then announce their name.  This hasn't worked for me, but I haven't messed around with it to know exactly what happened.  Not a huge deal for me, but would be pretty nice to have it work.Voice quality is also very good, people I'm talking to can't even tell.  The built in speaker sometimes seems lacking, but that's only if there is a lot of external noise in the car and you have to crank it up to hear it.", "I have a bluetooth in my car stereo and various bluetooth ear pieces. This little garage door opener size device is just incredibly easier to use and works really well. The sound quality is fantastic, and only once did my caller say they could hear themselves on feedback. The sound quality is loud and clear, and even when I'm driving 77 mph, I have no trouble hearing my callers nor do they have any trouble understanding me. My car bluetooth doesn't work so well at that speed. Also, I love not having to have a bluetooth attached to my ear while driving!This comes ready to attach to your visor. Voice dialing works great and the center call end button is smartly positioned. When I leave the car and come back it automatically reconnects. After a few weeks of use, I've only had one occurrence where it didn't automatically reconnect. In that case I turned it off, turned it back on, and it reconnected.It charges with a micro-usb (same as my phone) and the charge lasts a long time. I turn it off (side button) when I go home for the night and in the morning I reconnect and am able to safely take calls while driving. Several people who have been in my vehicle have asked me for the model number and were really impressed with this.", "I got this because I was constantly losing my bluetooth headsets, so I ended up buying something I figured I wouldn't put down and forget.I use the Cruiser 2 for my iPhone 4.1. it announces the callers +2. it can play the music via fm transmitter +3. battery life is exceptional! ++Only negative is the FM transmitterI would imagine with a unit of this size they could've made the transmitter a little more powerful.In the bay area our airways are really crowded and I always have to swap between a few stations I know are dead.The 14 hours of use time is actually what I get with the product. It's great because I can leave this in the carand plug it into the cig lighter when the batteries get low. Or I bring it inside the same night and charge it up.Even without using the fm transmitter the voice quality is very clear via the built in speakers and if you really wantedto you can play your music through there as well (not so great quality speakers for that though)", "This is a great speaker with truly superior sound.  It's hard to identify all of the ways in which this works so well.  It works in a loudish car.  It works in the kitchen, in the office, and in the backyard.  It has truly wonderful sound.  It has an amazing battery life.  It is extremely easy to use in comparison to a Bluetooth headset.  Does it sound like I love it?  I do.This speaker allows hands free driving - the first one that has worked for me.  I drive a Cherokee which has a certain amount of noise attached to it because it basically sounds like a truck from the inside.  The noise generally destroys most conversations - until now.  I can talk to everyone without any difficulty from background noise. The Crusier2 is said to be a hands free device for the car but it's so much more than that.  It works everywhere.  I use it while I am in the car, working in my office, cooking in the kitchen, or outside throwing the frisbee for the dog... there is no time or circumstance when this speaker let me down.I love this speaker. I spend about ten hours a week in the car and I get bored easily and end up talking on the phone.  The battery life on this is amazing - a charge lasts roughly twice as long as my Blackberry.  This works much better than any of the other devices I have ever tried, including Bluetooth headsets and talking through the radio with my Garmin nuvi.  Almost every other device I have ever tried gets complaints and I end up back using the cell phone.  This is a problem for me because I've had a neck injury and it's hard to hold a cell phone for any length of time.  Then I can't talk on the phone.  Then I get bored.  Then I cause trouble on the road.I am a complete incompetent when it comes to a Bluetooth head set.  I have never found a comfortable one that I could ever keep track of because I don't like wearing them all the time. Then the phone rings and I have to dig around in the bottom of my purse to find the head set.  Then I pick it up wrong and either end up hanging up on my caller or answering the call and then taking several minutes trying to get the head set over my ear and turned on.  My husband and children have actually learned to call me, have a call answered, and then wait several minutes while I work out all the kinks.  Unless they get hung up on.  Then they wait for me to call them back.  They all just sort of sigh at my incompetence.With this speaker, the only thing I have to do is flip up my visor in the car and answer the call on my phone and end it by pushing the button in the middle.  It even has a phone icon and a vol + and a vol- to turn the sound up and down.  It could not be simpler.Works + simple = amazing, incredible, wonderful Cruiser2.", "\"-CONNECTED-I also own a Jabra SP200, which is a simpler version of -DISCONNECTED- this device.  I have few complaints about the SP200, except that it has a -CONNECTED- variety of beeps to tell you what's going on.  Sometimes those beeps are somewhat confusing.  Does \"\"boo-beep\"\" mean -DISCONNECTED- the phone is connected, disconnected, or just a power-on signal?  The Cruiser2 has voice prompts which -CONNECTED- remove all ambiguity, which is good.  What's not so good is that if you're streaming music through the -DISCONNECTED- Cruiser2, they interrupt the music.  And my copy of the Cruiser2, at least, has an annoying tendency to make -CONNECTED- and break the connection with my phone about 3 or 4 times before it settles down.But it _does_ settle down, so eventually that problem goes away.  Otherwise this would be a 1-star \"\"unacceptable\"\" speakerphone.EDIT: Well, no, it doesn't.  Given how much hassle connecting it to the iPod has turned out to be, I took a short drive today with just my phone turned on.  It _never_ stopped alternating between CONNECTED and DISCONNECTED.  I think what happened before was that eventually it started ignoring my phone entirely, but showed Bluetooth Connected because the iPod still streaming music to it.Maybe it's just the copy of the Cruiser2 I received.  I've never had a similar problem with Jabra SP200 using the same phone, and you'd think that two products from the same company would be equally effective at making and keeping bluetooth connections.It does connect to two devices simultaneously as advertised.  As I mentioned, though, connecting my iPod Touch turned out to be painful.  The initial pairing worked, but re-connecting didn't.  Eventually I found that turning Bluetooth on and off for the Touch _sometimes_ resulted in a connection, but often enough it would drop the connection immediately.  When it did work, the Bluetooth streaming would drop 1-2 seconds of music every 4-5 minutes.I'm going back to using my Jabra SP200.\"", "\"The car I put this in is my daily driver, which is an old car great on gas and easy and cheap to maintain. It's not the most quiet car on the road with the windows rolled up, but the Cruiser2 seemed to be fine overcoming that. My first minor gripe was that the call volume was fine, but the integrated voice (i.e. \"\"speak now\"\") was much too quiet.The car lost its A/C recently, so when driving around town all the windows are down. Naturally noise environments are much more elevated, and frequently I could not hear the person on the other side over the noise of traffic around me even at low speeds and stand-stills. This is my biggest gripe.The last problem I had with this device which borderline made me frustrated with, was that one of my top three contacts I call was mis-recognized by the device every time I said it, even with windows up and no noise whatsoever around. It's not even a hard name, it's \"\"Phil\"\". When I told the device to contact him, every single time it would think I was trying to access my account balance, which is an undeletable contact on my SIM card.Summary: If my car were a more quiet car on the road, noise wouldn't be an issue. The large issue still stands about hearing calls and the device's integrated voice when windows are down whether in traffic or not. The issue with not recognizing one of my top contacts sealed the deal with me returning this for another type of Bluetooth device. I ordered theLG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orangein hopes I will like it for its multiple features over the typical Bluetooth headsets most of us reading this review have used.\"", "The Jabra Cruiser2 is attractive. It is lightweight but has a solid feel to it.Controls are simple to use and understand.Pairing the Jabra Cruiser2 was quick and simple. A pleasant voice provides pairing instructions and also tells you quite clearly what's going on with the unit.It's internal speaker seems to be larger, clearer and has a better volume output.Make sure your cell phone is no more than 2-year old. It can download the contact from my newer cell-pone and it won't download contact list from my older cellpone. It's a simple incompatability between my cell phone and the Cruiser2 due to different Blue-Tooth version. Once the contact list is downloaded, it will enunciate the names of incoming callers if they are in your phone-book.The car charger port and data cable themselves are also going to be a GREAT help! You can charge the speaker system directly in the car. Just plug in the included mini-USB car charging cable directly to your device and you never need to take it out of the car to charge it elsewhere. Once charged (a green light coming on) you can then unplug the device and use it for many hours before it needs charging again. The same charger can be used to charge anything device taking USB mini-input.Conversation quality is good. My friends hear me clear and loud without too much road noise.Overall, a well functioning product.", "I use this in my car. I haven't used the FM, but the podcasts and internet radio for talk its great. Good voice interaction to let you know what's what. Connects seamlessly to blue tooth and has a good battery life.", "This unit is super-easy to set up, simple to use and the clarity of the speaker is really good. I highly recommend it. I was able to set it up for both of my cell phones in about two minutes.", "The noise cancelling on this was not as good as advertised... my wife could not hear me over the road noise as I drove. Also using it to broadcast audio to my radio was terrible... might be Los Angeles and it's congested radio waves, but I couldn't get a clear signal on my radio ever without having to keep a hand on the Jabra.I ended up returning it and got a cheap iogear one that is solar powered for about 60 dollars less. Much better buy!", "Although I've used a Plantronics Bluetooth earpiece, I must admit that I've never been crazy about the idea of an earpiece.  The Jabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone is so much more comfortable for me to use while driving!  After I realized that it would take a couple hours to charge the unit, I plugged it into the car and it was ready for pairing by the time I arrived home from my day of errands.  The pairing was intuitive, the voice basically guided me through the process, and I was making my first hands free, earpiece free call in a minute!  The clarity is excellent and the battery is outstanding.  Because it's so cold outside now, I've charged it again, but the battery was still alive.  I love the option to charge the unit either in the car or via the usb option.  This is a lightweight unit, small in size and the clip is lightweight but sturdy.  It doesn't contain extraneous buttons or lights, just what it needs.  Listening to music through the FM worked, but I doubt that I'll use the function often.  All in all, I really like this speakerphone and see why my favorite warehouse club store offered it through their coupon booklet recently.", "PROS:Easy to useCall sound quality is fineCuts out a lot of ambient noiseComes with a car adapter for the USB charging cableAppears to be well made and of high qualityA nice way to beam music from your phone to your FM radioCONS:Tinny integrated speakerDoes not work well as a speaker phone for large groups of peopleDefinitely usable, but some echoing when beaming phone calls to FM radioDoesn't come with a wall chargerThe Jabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone is easy to use and does a fine job of making your cellphone hands free.Inside the box you will fine the device itself, a USB cord, and a cigarette lighter adapter for the USB cord, so that you can charge the speakerphone directly in your car.  There is no standard, wall adapter for the USB cable, however, so this you would have to buy separately.Set up is straightforward.  You turn your telephone on and activate Bluetooth connections.  You turn the CRUISER2 on and your phone recognizes the device.  Once accepted, the speakerphone works easily.The device itself clips easily to the visor in most cars.  Operating it is simple.  You press the CRUISER's bar in the center (area with the phone icon) and it will answer a call. At the end of the call, hang up by pressing the same icon.  A double tap will call the last dialed number.  The volume can be controlled by pressing either side of the bar, indicated by - and + signs.  The mute button is located just behind the phone icon and is marked as such.  All these controls are straightforward and easy to use.The device's speaker is serviceable, but given the size the sound is rather tinny.  You can have the CRUISER send all audio through your FM radio by simply pressing a small button on the side of the device.  The CRUISER announces the frequency and you can set your radio to it.  If you require a different FM frequency, simply press the volume + button and the CRUISER will scan up and announce the next channel.  All this works reasonably well, depending on the occupied FM frequencies in your area.  The sound through my car speakers was much better than that of the speakerphone itself.The CRUISER picks up your voice well enough and seems to minimize car noise and other ambient sounds.  My sources on the other end of the line could not tell that I was using a speakerphone when I was using the CRUISER in the usual mode.  When I used the CRUISER to beam the call through the car speakers, however, the more perceptive listeners on the other end heard a discernible echo.  This was considered to be more than tolerable.  So from a users perspective FM beaming improves the sound quality for the caller.  But for those who you call, it makes may degrade the call quality somewhat.The CRUISER has a fairly directed microphone to pick up your voice.  It basically picks up what is directly in front of it.  This is good, as it cuts down on ambient noise in the car.  However, there is no way to turn off this feature.  So if your kids want to speak to their grandparents, for example, you might have to pass the device to them so that they can speak into it.  So for a single person talking in the car, this is ideal.  For families where you want the kids to shout out messages for their grandparents to hear, not so good.For those who want to, the device can be used to hear your cellphone's music collection on your car's FM radio.  Generally speaking, this worked well.  However, if FM bands are crowded in your area you may have some problems with static and interference.  The device, however, does do a good job to dampen weak signals in the area and does give you the option of changing channels as noted above.", "Perfect - easy to use and setup for my mom for her birthday. She had been wanting one for a while and finally decided on this one. She's been using it a few weeks now with no issues at all so far. She drives a lot for work so she's constantly on the phone.", "\"This is a very cool device, and for around $60 a great solution for listening to podcasts, music, even GPS voice directions.However, it is flawed in one respect, the audio output is very thin, or \"\"tinny\"\" sounding.  Seems okay at first, but after 30 minutes or so, it becomes quite annoying.It seems as though Jabra already knows this themselves, as they now have a Jabra Freeway, a 3 speaker system, that supposedly has much better audio.\"", "If you have a smartphone, and want to make calls while driving without compromising your attention to the wheel, this product is a must-have. It has everything you will need except, voice dialing, which I don't care for since most voice dialing features don't work properly due to different names & accents etc.Set-up- Very easy. There is an inbuilt recorded voice which guides you for pairing and let you know when it is connected to the phone.Ease of use - Very convenient. It can be mounted on your sun visor and can be operated easily with one hand. There are only two buttons on the side, power & FM. The inbuilt voice tells you when it is turned on or off, and the FM transmitter frequency. It makes it easy to operate this device without having to remove your eyesight from the road. The vol buttons, which also works as FM frequency changers, and call buttons are also very smooth and easy to reach.FM Signal: Very good, works flawlessly. You need to search for a blank frequency in your area for noise-free listening.Bluetooth: Very easy and flawless signal reception/pairing with phone.Battery Life: This is the best feature of this device. Initially I was skeptical about it, but now after using it for more than 15 hrs on one charge, no issues at all.Recharging: There is a car charger with a USB pin behind it. So, you can charge it either way.Compatibility: It works with both iPhone 3G, & iPhone 4 and can play the stored songs or direct streaming through any app. It also downloads the address book and the inbuilt voice says the name when you receive a call.Overall, I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it", "Maryland went handsfree in October so I must use either an in-ear bluetooth or speaker phone. I got a speaker phone because the in-ear have trouble staying in the ear if you have small ears. If it props against the ear, you cannot hear as well. I also need the bluetooth for the car only.I got a Blue Ant St originally and liked it. The speaker phone was bulky though and the speaker attaches to a magnetic clip that slips over your visor. The Jabra is very lightweight and has an clip integral to the set. The Blue Ant does not have many voice prompts and they do not seem to work as well as the Jabra does in this respect. Also while the Blue Ant works well with my LG Ally(work cell), it does not work as well with my Blackberry.The Jabra works well and connects easily to both-too easily sometimes. If I turn on my Blackberry after my Ally, it disconnects from the Ally without asking and connects to the Blackberry. This is troublesome and causes much frustration as I need my work cell to be connected during the day. I spend 50 per cent of my day on the road. The Jabra has also been turning off when it answers the phone. I do not know why this is happening and must call tech support. I never give a good rating if I have to call tech support.The biggest strength that the Jabra has is that I can hear my callers and they can hear me well. There is very little static or garble. This is a continuous problem with this technology either speaker or in-ear. I think Jabra is improving this.Now I just have to get this speakerphone to stay on and not connect to a phone when I do not want it too. I manually turned off the bluetooth in the Blackberry to solve the connection issue. Jabra should prompt me though for a connection.I have not used the FM transmitter so I cannot comment on that."], "Gamma": [0.020023362711071968, 0.020023362711071968, 0.18574555218219757,
