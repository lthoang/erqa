The screen size is excellent and helpful.  The voice controls are great and intuitive.  The smartphone integration is extremely useful and easy to set up.  Highly recommended!", "There really isn't anything nice I can say about this GPS save that I got it for free as a review copy. It takes forever to find its bearing and when it does, it inevitably has yo go the most roundabout way to reach a location. I've had it try to have me go down roads that don't exist, routes that are twice as long as ways we'd normally go and once it even tried having us go through a park. Not a road through a park - an actual park! Spoken voice recognition only works with a single voice on the GPS, the interface is glitchy and can sometimes stall and the entire thing simply isn't user friendly compared to numerous other GPS' I've had in the past. THis is my first and only TomTom. I'm still just shocked at how this thing manages to do everything wrong and nothing right. Add in the fact that TomTom charges over $200 for a product there barely works and you have a product that is all but guaranteed to infuriate anyone who tries to use it. Stay away. Stay far away!", "\"I had an old Garmin GPS for quite a few years and even though it does the job this model is SOOOOO much better.  I used it for the first time yesterday since I'm not too good at navigating the streets of New Orleans.  First, this one talks to you which helps out a lot!  My old Garmin didn't do that.  My absolute favorite feature is the \"\"red light camera detector!\"\"  Yes...it shows you if the intersection your approaching has a red light camera.  I don't know about anywhere else but New Orleans police dept. they will mail you a ticket not only if you are running a red light but if you are speeding too!  The screen is nice and large and I found it quite easy to figure out how to use it.  The touchscreen works relatively well..(no different than any other touch screen device out there!) But I have to admit I haven't tried the newer models of other brand GPS that is compatible to this particular unit.  All I know is that if you have an older GPS...investing in a newer updated model is necessary.I almost forgot to mention that on the lower left hand corner it shows the posted speed limit and your current speed limit!  If you go over is turns RED!  I just love it!!!!\"", "When I use a GPS, the main requirement is that it gives me good directions to my destination. With the three trips I've taken with this model, one was the most direct and quickest route, while with the other two, I was directed to routes that were out of the way and added extra miles and time over those that I was already quite familiar with, and knew were the best and fastest ways to my destination.Another problem is that there are almost too many verbal directions. This machine never shuts up, to the extent that its constant directions become more confusing than helpful.What I do like are the magnets that attach the GPS to the holder, and the easy way in which the holder mounts to the dashboard.What I *don't* like is the long time the machine takes to boot up, and the way that the TomTom software has made its website my startup screen when my computer starts -- gonna figure out a way to end that fast. The verbal commands are okay, but the machine does *not* recognize street names, in spite of what the literature suggests.I'll let it replace my old Magellan for a while longer, and if things go better, I'll come back and up my rating and change this review. If not, into the drawer with it.", "This is a replacement for an older TomTom GPS and I think it is a great value. Has a lot of great features and the Lifetime maps as well as Traffic are a big plus for this TomTom. Very happy with the performance of this TomTom. I would recommend this TomTom GO 2535TM to anyone looking for a great produce as well as a great value.", "\"UPDATE:  I am on my second device and the battery has stopped holding a charge.  This and the first one lasted for a few months and then started to no longer hold charge until the unit would not work without being plugged in.  I also had a large issue where I was trying to update the device on my MacBook Pro and when I unplugged the cable from the device (still plugged into the computer), the device cut off and the computer cut off.  The computer would not come back on and supposedly the logic board is fried, and I am waiting for the MacBook to be repaired by Apple.  I called TomTom and let them know, but they say it could not have caused the problem (I would not think it could, but I now have a dead laptop, so...).  They said they are unable to replace the TomTom since it is out of warranty, but they do have good customer support and tried to help.  I now am too afraid to ever plug it in to a computer, so I will not update it again (the GPS still works, only when it is plugged in).  There are numerous factors that could have caused my problem, but I wanted to let you know so if you have a similar problem we can see a pattern or you can try to avoid the steps I took and hopefully not have a problem like this!Here is my original review, it is still a good device, just when plugged up (not on battery and I am afraid to ever try to plug it into a computer again).This device is amazing!  It offers so many features in such a compact device!  The first thing to focus on is the beautiful 5\"\" screen, which is showcased when you turn the device on and see the beautiful TomTom logo with the car in the city, the screen is large enough where you can easily see everything you need on the screen, but not too large, where it gets in the way.This device's best feature (other then lifetime traffic and maps) is the voice recognition.  I tried out a few phrases (using different wording) and it worked every time.  -- If you have a problem wording commands it comes with a command list and you can view the commands within the device.  There is an easy to use quick access button on the home screen that activates voice recognition, for example I said \"\"Navigate to the nearest Hospital\"\" and it found the nearest Hospital/clinic and spoke the time and distance it takes.  You can also use simple commands like Cancel Route to stop and clear routes!The device comes with the ability to connect to a cell phone and make calls using Bluetooth, and allows you to use voice recognition to active calls!  --However, my vehicle already has Bluetooth, so I do not plan to use this feature, but if your car does not, then this is perfect since many states are moving to hands free only calling.What makes this device stand out is the \"\"Lifetime Traffic & Maps Edition\"\" stated on the front of the box!  When you open the box you have a voucher for Lifetime Maps, that you can use on the MyTomTom webpage/software, which if you have had a GPS in the past, you know that roads change way too often and maps are expensive.  The power adapter (which is not standard USB, so no option of using other cables) has a receive built on it to enable live traffic updates, which means you have to have your TomTom plugged into the vehicle power adapter to utilize this feature -- no battery power.The device has a redesigned user interface, which I like.  It allows you to create 'shortcuts' (like to voice recognition, or parking garages and others [you are limited to what you can add, but it still is neat]) and has new graphics and alerts to help you stay safe and get to your destination fast!The device is easy to setup and install in your car, use the windshield mount and turn the knob, also, this unit has an easier to use mount, the knob locks into place and is wider, making turning it easier, if you have had past TomTom units you will note they have a very small slippery lock to windshield mechanism.After reading some other reviews, I wanted to explain some other features:When I get in the car, it takes roughly 5 to 20 seconds to get a GPS signal, which is fine with me and seems normal (to me)...I find the button to access the voice recognition adequate.  It is on the driver side, it is not large, but if you placed a super large button on the screen it would block the map.The GPS does not (to my knowledge, maybe there is a setting) have auto turn on.  However, regardless, I drive a Ford, and Ford's power adapters do not power off when the car is turned off, they run all the time.  Because of this I have to cut it off and on myself, which is not the devices issue, but I wanted to let everyone know all that I know about the device.Like others have mentioned other device voices (non standard or computer), will not read street names.  However, this is in all devices (TomTom devices).I wanted to let you all know, just in case you have two TomTom devices, this was my second TomTom, and my first TomTom (which I am using in my other car) was registered to my email address, and when I uninstalled TomTom Home (which is not used by this device, follow the instructions on the Lifetime Map insert about MyTomTom) I registered my new TomTom (GO 2535TM) and it asked if I wanted to link to my account.  I said YES, and activated the Lifetime Map access code.  However, (I am starting to get off topic) when I installed TomTom HOME for my older device on another computer, I was told if I register my old device with my TomTom account (same email as I used for the new device), the old one will be removed, and I may not be able to go back to my Lifetime Maps.  To remedy this I created a new account with a new email for TomTom, one for each device.My only flaw is the new MyTomTom software (this device does not use TomTom Home), the software installs in Windows (or Macintosh), but uses your web browser to download items and alter your device.  I like the TomTom Home better, but maybe they will improve the site and make it better than TomTom Home!  If you are having problems getting the web page to connect to the device, try looking in your System Tray or Notification Tray (Next to clock in Windows) for the MyTomTom icon and check and see if it has found your device.  If not try disconnecting, if you still have problems try using a different default web browser (I used Google Chrome and had no problems).  Also, I feel that the website has a few glitches (it is new after all), if you only see an option for Account Details, try clicking on a different part of the site (Shop, Support...) and then check in the MyTomTom drop down menu, this sometimes (at least for me) got other options (like Activate Code) on the site.If I find an issue with the device, I will be sure to let you all know, but so far I love it!  Like today, \"\"Navigate to nearest Publix), and it found my local Publix perfectly!!!  -- Which, in my opinion, is awesome!!!In all, this device does everything you could want from a GPS, and with the lifetime map updates you never have to worry about driving on out dated maps, I highly recommend this unit, and plan to get many years of great life out of it!UPDATE: I wanted to let everyone know that the MyTomTom website is working better.  The website is now allowing map updates and software patches and updates.  So if you have not plugged in recently, you should update via MyTomTom.  The update is pretty large and takes a few hours (I have DSL) -- FYI.  Also the problem of the options disappearing (on certain pages) seem to have ceased.  I use Google Chrome and it works perfectly with the update process.UPDATE: I live in South Georgia, and have found that the heat causes the Window Arm, to make the GPS look down, instead of straight.  I leave the device in the window, and whenever I drive or just have it sitting their it will slowly start to tilt the face of the GPS toward the dash and no longer at me.  This is an issue with the arm, and I guess the weight of the unit and the heat where I live (around 95 to 110 degrees, on some of the hotter days).  This is just an FYI, as it is not an issue with the unit itself, but it can get annoying after a while.\"", "\"The GO2535TM states in big letters on its box:1. WORLD TRAVELER EDITION. MAPS OF UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, AND EUROPE.2.

NO WORD ABOUT EUROPE MAPS which, as per above, are clearly included.I then complained again and this time I was emailed that \"\"If you wish to update the map of Europe, you can go ahead and PURCHASE the map of Europe with 1 year Map Update Service (MUS)\"\"In my opinion, this is fraudulent advertising.Readers may want to make their own determination and act accordingly.\"", "I did a lot of research on TomTom vs Garmin and ultimately got one of each.  Purely from a directions point of view I like my Garmin better, however given the fantastic utility of the TomTom I actually USE my TomTom More.Here's what I love about the TomTom:- Great integration with my iPhone so I can use it as a hands free speakerphone in my car- Fantastic display that I can clearly see even in bright light- Perfect mount which positions the GPS perfectly in the car and it easily comes out of the mount when not in use- Red Light Camera Warnings- Letting me know when I need to change lanes on a Highway and showing pictures of the exits- Finds the GPS satellites VERY fast 10x faster than my Garmin- Free Lifetime Map Updates!What I don't love- The directions.  Sometimes they are too round about or put me on roads that aren't the fastest or best route- The phone book doesn't have my favoritesLots of pros, but the first con is a biggie too. Still this is the GPS I use the most and it's the one I'd recommend.*** Update 8/8/11****After using this GPS for a while I've found even more to like about it.  Driving with it at night it automatically sets the background to a dark color so it's not too bright.  Also you can enter directions in via voice commands, it's not perfect but it's a LOT safer than trying to do it by hand while you are driving.  Again, it's not perfect, but I've really come to love this TomTom.", "\"(You may notice this review is very similar to my review of the TomTom VIA1505.  These are very similar devices so I've copied large portions of the reviews but made adjustments where appropriate.)My wife has been harping me for a GPS in her car for some time. After a recent stint in a loaner car equipped with a factory GPS, I began searching in earnest for a good GPS to fill the need. I originally was looking at the Garmin Nuvi line but some of reviews commented on \"\"commercials\"\" appearing when the driver is stopped and I was totally unwilling to pay top dollar for a GPS just for the privilege of staring at advertisements. When I saw the new GO and VIA lines from TomTom I decided to take a closer look.I ended up picking up both a GO2535TM and a VIA1505. The GO model is more of a \"\"top of the line\"\" model compared to the mid-grade VIA1505. I'll talk about some of the differences below but first let me give a brief summary of my findings with the 2535:Pros:Very affordable.Useful traffic updates (for free!)Lifetime free map updatesVery fast re-routing.Very large screen.Nice size.Really helpful intersection detail screens pop up when going through a route.No problem with polarized sunglasses.Cons:Vehicle mount is not well built and cannot hold unit upright for long (sags).Screen washes out badly in the Texas sun.Battery life is less than 90 minutes.Speed limit data is often inaccurate.User interface is kind of slow.MyTomTom service is a bit kludgy.Very slow acquisition of GPS signal (> 90 seconds)FORM FACTORThe GO2535 is a very svelte GPS with a large screen.MYTOMTOM SOFTWAREThe MyTomTom software is run through your web browser.  It works on a Macintosh or Windows and requires you to first register your device with an e-mail address.  Once registered, when you plug your device in, a helper tool will recognize it and open your web browser and then show you the available updates.  I don't really care for how it works (would rather have a dedicated application like Garmin) but it does work fine.SCREENI took the GPS out to my car to go for a spin. I was immediately pleased to see that my polarized sunglasses did not interfere with screen visibility. Unfortunately, when I stepped outside of my house, the Texas sun so badly washed out the display that I thought something was wrong. I stepped into my dark garage and suddenly the screen was clearly visible again. I went into the settings to make sure there weren't any power saving options or screen brightness settings that needing adjustment- there were not.Once I mounted the GPS in my car and started driving around, I continued to find the screen (on battery power) to be barely visible. On a hunch, I plugged in the (included) 12volt adapter cord and suddenly the screen became noticeably brighter. It still wasn't great, but it was at least visible even in the bright sunlight. I later learned that the battery life on this unit is so bad that I have to leave it plugged in all the time anyway.VEHICLE MOUNTThe vehicle mount is slick.  The unit rests in place held by magnets.  The connector itself cinches up with a magnetic pull so you don't even have to do any work to connect things- very clever.  This makes it very easy to remove your device and reinstall it.Unfortunately, the ball-joint for this unit is not well engineered and over a period of 60 days, it gets so loose it can no longer hold the GPS upright.  I've now gone through TWO of these vehicles mounts (TomTom was kind enough to send me a replacement after the first one started sagging).  The ball joint tension is not adjustable I have no confidence that this thing will ever hold up for more than a month or two.  This is a major reason why this GPS gets 2 stars.USER INTERFACEI entered a few destinations using the built in search feature. It was reasonably easy to find restaurants and other points of interest near my house. I was a bit perplexed by how slow the interface was- when I pushed a key on the virtual keyboard there was usually a noticeable delay. The delay was so long that sometimes I ended up pushing the same key multiple times before the letter showed up on the screen.Overall I find the user interface to be a bit non-intuitive.  At the very least it seems to require too many clicks to do basic things like finding a restaurant.  That coupled with the slight sluggishness really detracts from this unit.BATTERYWith a full charge, I've been getting less than 90 minutes of battery life. I haven't actually used the unit until the battery totally expires but I have seen the low battery warning come on well before the 90 minute mark. This is a bit annoying as it means you realistically have to leave it plugged in most of the time. Due to the screen brightness issue, I'm having to leave it plugged in anyway.GPS SIGNAL ACQUISITIONThe first time I left my house, I was puzzled because the GPS wasn't showing any movement. I drove out of my neighborhood and to a nearby stoplight. This is about a 90 second drive. During this time the GPS said it was \"\"acquiring GPS signal\"\". Finally, while sitting at the stoplight, the GPS updated and correctly showed my location for the remainder of my drive. This initial acquisition was a lot slower than I expected. Sometimes when I'm downtown at a baseball game I want to quickly figure out how to get home. If I have to wait 90 seconds to get a GPS signal, I'll be driving blind for quite some time before I get any guidance as to which one-way street is going to take me to the desired interstate. If I sit in my car for 90 seconds, tons of fans pour into the streets and cause endless backups. I'm pretty disappointed with this and am hoping it improves with firmware updates.SPEED LIMIT DISPLAYOne feature of the GO2535 is that it displays posted speed limits on major roads. Unfortunately, I estimate that 25% of the speed limits in the GO2535 are inaccurate. In many cases the posted speeds are slower than what the GPS displays. This is a recipe for a speeding ticket! In the end, I find that I can't trust and have to ignore these speed limits. I wish there was a way to hide them altogether since they can't be depended on. Both my VIA1505 and GO2535TM have this issue so it seems to be something in TomTom's data feed.POINTS OF INTERESTI configured my GO2535 to display restaurants and gas stations along my route. I found that it was a bit spotty. There were several gas stations (Citgo, Valero and even some Shell stations) that I drove by that did not appear on my map. Several Chevrons did show up. Likewise with restaurants, the TomTom was missing a Burger King, Jack in the Box and Chick-fil-a however it showed me several McDonalds and Sonics. I did not notice any \"\"small\"\" restaurants showing up on the GPS. Good luck finding a hole-in-the-wall gem with the TomTom. I'm not surprised or disappointed by that- just reporting the facts.NAVIGATION GUIDESWhere this unit really shines is in the most basic feature of taking you to a destination. First, I love the custom intersection and highway exit screens that come up to tell you which direction each lane can go. At one point I was on a 7-lane stretch of freeway and the TomTom dutifully drew all 7 lanes with arrows showing where they were headed (veering right, going straight, etc...). Very cool and very confidence inspiring! I love this feature.REROUTINGAlso, this unit is very fast at recalculating routes. Even on a 60 minute drive, any slight change in my route resulted in a reroute in just a matter of seconds. I've read other GPS units taking 60-90 seconds to calculate a new route. Clearly this is not an issue for the GO2535.  My wife also commented on how quickly the unit rerouted when she altered her route. This is a very important feature and one at which the GO2535 excels.IQ ROUTESAnother feature that seems to work as advertised is the \"\"IQ Routes\"\" that allow the GO2535 to route you around predicted traffic jams. If I leave work at lunch time, it will take me home via one route. If I leave at 5:30, it takes me another route that completely bypasses a huge backup with the first route. This is a great feature to have given that this product does not have any traffic updates.SUMMARYThe sluggish response when interacting with the unit, the not-as-intuitive-as-I-hoped-for user interface, and the sagging window mount have me not really caring for this GPS.  I lost it after less than 6 months of ownership (very careless!!!) and I replaced it with a Garmin 3490LMT which so far seems like a far superior product.\"", "I got this unit to replace a Garmin that was a few years old.  The good....My Garmin did not have international coverage, and I had to pay for map updates.My Garmin did not have voice recognition and spoken directions.This has a nicer user interface.So all the above are terrific.  The downside is that this is a much larger and heavier unit - which seems counter-intuitive as electronics seem to get smaller, and I find that while many would find the bigger screen a plus, the TomTom is often a bit big and bulky.", "I think this TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE is an excellent GPS.  It takes me where I want to go, it's easy to use, and it has many useful features.The screen is the most obvious--and one of the best--features.  It's a gorgeous 5-inch display with vivid colors, clear text and graphics, and no glare.  It really is almost shocking to see the display's quality, particularly if you're used to a smaller, older GPS.I found the maps to be fine.  Sure, there are some streets it doesn't know about, and some of the Points of Interest, gas stations, and businesses have changed ownership or aren't there any more.  Things happen, and I can live with that.  Sooner or later, the map updates will catch up with reality.  And this, after all, is an issue with all GPS systems, not just TomTom.  And speaking of map updates, this unit features lifetime, free map and traffic updates.Several reviews take issue with the voice recognition.  I played with it a couple of times, but frankly, to me it's not a big deal.  It works fine, and the on-screen button for it is plenty large enough, but most of the time, I plan a route in advance, and I key it in with the on-screen virtual keyboard.  Voice recognition works only with the default voice?  OK, why is that a problem?  If I want to use the voice recognition, then I guess I'll use the default voice, which, after all, is articulate and pleasant.I haven't tried the Bluetooth connection feature.  Frankly, I don't want to make or take phone calls when I'm driving, whether I can do so hands-free or not.Some reviews take issue with the new MyTomTom software, which uses your web browser to download software and map updates.  I followed the instructions, and it recognized my device quickly and did the necessary updates.  I just didn't have any problems at all.  One time-- and only one time-- MyTomTom didn't recognize that my unit was plugged in.  I disconnected the cable, then plugged it in again, and everything was fine.  MyTomTom is apparently a new thing, which probably accounts for the slight awkwardness of the site.  The drop-down menu under MyTomTom in the upper right part of the site seems to work best, even when the various options, such as Activate Code for map updates, aren't apparently available elsewhere on the page.Is this a perfect GPS?  Of course not; I doubt that such a thing exists.  However, I think this is an excellent GPS.  It gets me to where I want to go efficiently, and I haven't had any of the issues that some other reviewers have had.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on its durability, but it seems to be a well-built, high-quality unit that will last for many years.  I recommend it most highly.", "I recently purchased the new Tom Tom 2535TM and after loading all the new software (which was very easy to do)  and using it on several trips; I can tell you that this is the best Tom Tom I have owned and I have owned several to include the Via 1505 (which I still own). I also recently purchased the new Garmin 3590LMT and found that to be the worst navigator I have ever owned, even worse than my Garmin 1490. The Garmin sets what I would describe as crazy routes i.e. taking you off paved highways and putting you on rough county roads for no good  reason and taking you off interstate highways onto service roads and then putting you back on the interstate for absolutely no reason; Once it routed me up a alley way that was to narrow to turn around. I can go on and on with that, so needless to say I sent it back and bought the Tom Tom 2535TM. I have read a lot of horror stories here on the Tom Tom 2535 but if you look closely it was the battery and computer interface that was the source of most complaints; both those have been fixed and the Tom Tom 2535 stands alone as the best navigating GPS on the market today with its IQ routing. My Tom Tom's have never let me down. The best GPS that you can buy is the one you can trust and for me that is Tom Tom with it's superior routing. I never felt confident with the Garmin 3590 because I never knew what crazy route it might put me on.", "I want to preface my review by stating that the only point of comparison that I have is a two year oldGarmin n&uuml;vi 255W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator. I only mention this because there is an obvious price point difference and I want to be fair to Garmin.That being said this is the most ascetically pleasing, most feature laden, and downright neatest GPS I have used or seen. Before I go any further, however, I have noticed that some individuals have had some serious complaints about the product. One recurring complaint seems to be with voice commands. I want to address this issue because I witnessed my wife shouting random commands at our new device and then voicing her concerns that it didn't understand her. Well, the truth is that it does only understand certain commands, but one needs to read the user manual to discover this and get an idea of what one can say to it. In my opinion the commands are extensive and cover quite a few bases, but it does take a touch of patience.A second complaint that I have heard is with regard to the Bluetooth function. It does take about a minute (more with multiple phones) to set up, but I think it's worth it. The sound quality is great and out of probably twenty calls, I have only had one complaint from the other end about call quality; however, I think he just didn't like being on speaker...understandable. The most impressive feature in my opinion as far as the call quality goes is the fact that one can set the volume to adjust according to the speed of the vehicle, which ensures that the ambient noise of travel won't drown out a call. I do have one disclaimer: It is much easier to pull up a number on my phone's contact list and call than to locate a number via the TomTom's uploaded contact list.The only real design issue with this model that I have yet to experience is the lack of directional compass. It seems small, but I wish it were there.I realize that I say that I like it but only point out faults. Well, I feel like it would be more beneficial to the potential consumer to know what I perceive to be the drawbacks, rather than saying that everything else it is supposed to do it does well; which it does. I will say that I am thrilled with the idea of never having to get another reminder from a GPS telling me it's time to pay to update its maps.I highly recommend this device. I also highly recommend that the, relatively brief, user manual be read for the sake of getting the most out of it and avoiding unnecessary disappointment.", "There's lots to like about this World Traveler GPS, but I've found problems that make it less than the perfect GPS.Here's my take on the TomTom World Traveler:PROS:1.  Love the big screen that's easy to see on the dash.2.  Putting in a route pre-travel is easy; also getting an alternate route is great!3.  In heavy traffic, having the lane selection feature can help get you through a big mess with less irritation.4.  Having free lifetime map updates is a great feature.  My neighbor's Garmin charges for each new update, so I'm saving money.CONS:1.  Voice instructions are loud and clear; however, I find that I need a bit more forewarning.  The voice says turn right when you're at the turn.  If you weren't already looking closely, you'd miss your turn.2. TomTom doesn't like my voice.  Too often, I am instructed to repeat my command because it was not understood.  And, yes, I am using the commands TomTom accepts.3.  I'm not able to disconnect the GPS when I leave the car because the ring connector does not want to disconnect.  On the other hand, the GPS doesn't come loose while I'm driving.OVERALL:While there are many excellent features on this TomTom GPS, the fact that often it does not recognize my voice commands makes this device less than practical for use in heavy traffic.  While I need my eyes on the road, I cannot spend time looking frequently at the GPS, so I do not find this device completely useful.Three Stars!", "\"I had an old TOMTOM via an HP IPAQ, and liked the TT interface. Hence I bought this unit. I must say that TT has too many models and numbers, and this confuses the buyer.The unit arrived rapidily from Amazon, and I read all the documentation to start/update it via the TT website.That site said: \"\"Mandatory Update\"\" and asked for the unit's serial number. It then rejected that number and said invaild number (It proved to be a valid number.) I did this several times, always with the same result.Giving up on that, I went to update my maps: The site said I had everything at the latest version.I then used the unit. It works well, but it had several map errors on Hilton Head Island SC, where I live.I chechked my map vinatge and it was dated 11/2010. That seemed quite old to be labled recent.Given that, I went to their email support (takes some digging to find) and asked questions. The first reponse was not useful, so I tried again and got a better person. That was a gold mine. Here is what I found from their advice:1 - You must use Chrome or Firefox to do updates, not IE.2- You need to make sure that you are plugged into a well amped USB port. That means no hub, and perhaps having to look front and back on the PC for a good socket.3 - Since my GPS works, I did not update that. But that \"\"mandatory update\"\" message caused stress.4 - I'm not sure the update would have updated anyway, since their website says I have a non-existent serial number.5 - Once I typed in my free map update certificate number (I have an M model) using Chrome and registered my code, I found that there was indeed a much newer map. That map was dated 4/2012 as opposed to the 11/2010 map that came with my newly purchased machine.That was very odd:A - Why was a very new machine shipped in June 2012 with a very old map?B - The website not notifying me of that until I typed in a free map code.6 - I also asked for a better manual than the one that came in the box. They gave me a web link for a good manual. It is for some other TOMTOM product number, but did have the info I wanted.7 - There are strange symbols that show up on the screen.  They are covered on page 24 of the on-line manual, not on the picture of the manual in the box. They are related to the marker function, which is not described in the manual that comes with the unit.Overall I'm still happy with the hardware product and the help from the TT website, after the second try.BUT TT really needs to work on their documentation and website. I am a techy and have lots of patience and curiosity. But the overall user experience for someone just looking for a simple appliance would be catostrophic.For example, the warning to use Chrome or Firefox does not show up.  I would imagine that most customers would want a smoother less techy and less stressful initial experience than I found. My guess is that TT and Amazon are getting a lot of returns from people who just will not put up with this.P.S. - The Bluetooth setup to an original Verizon Android Incredible was easy and works well.\"", "\"If TomTom wanted Beta-testers, they would have had no shortage of volunteers. If TomTom had delayed the release of this item until it was fully functional, they would have had a few disappointed pre-order customers but otherwise happy users. However, charging customers the current price for a buggy product which is clearly not ready for sale is unacceptable. Selling this product in its current form is false advertising. Plain and simple.I'll start with the positive:1. The windshield mount is very nice. The twist/click suction cup works great and the magnetic dock is super simple to use.2. The screen is nice and big. The graphics display nicely and are clear and easy to understand in a glance.3. It gives directions. That IS why you want a GPS system, after all, isn't it? ;)4. Unlike some other reviewers, mine finds its signal extremely quickly. It is ready to go long before I am (having to connect it to the dock and power cord, start car, check mirrors, etc).5. It seems to do everything quickly. It recalculates my route within a few feet if I choose not to take its suggested turns. Scrolling through menus is quick as the page refresh is very fast.Sorry, that's all I've got for pros. So far, I Just. Don't. Like. It.Here's why:1. The browser-based interface is glitchy. Sometimes it connects to my device right away. Sometimes I have to plug and unplug it a few times to get it to show up. Sometimes it goes right to the overview page (which contains only paragraphs about all the fabulous features which TomTom will release eventually but don't actually work yet and a link to non-existent accessories); sometimes my only option is to change my email address and password. I have to close and reopen my browser until it offers the full list of choices.2. Unavailable features:a. TomTom claims the voices read street names. While it's technically true that the DEFAULT voice reads street names, it is the only one. Spoken address recognition is only available with this voice as well (per the manual). You better hope you like Samantha.b. Add-on voices don't work. They don't actually tell you this until after you've paid for them and call to ask why you can't get them to download onto your device. Then they \"\"helpfully\"\" offer to \"\"try to refund\"\" your money. Which will take 7-10 business days.c. Home software. One of the advertised features is the ability to manage your device from your desktop. Then you call TomTom support because the software can't see your device and they tell you \"\"never mind. You can't do that.\"\" No estimate on when any of these features will become available.3. As other reviewers have mentioned, the button for voice control is VERY tiny. Almost impossible to hit accurately while driving without taking your eyes off the road while you do it, which defeats the purpose of voice control. A double-tap of the screen or larger button would have been a much better choice.4. Menus could be condensed and reorganized for ease of use. Some of the options don't seem to make sense where they are.5. Worst of all for me: Customer Support. TomTom thinks it's perfectly acceptable to advertise a product can do things it can't and charge people full price while they wait around for features that might work someday. I was told flat-out by a tech \"\"TomTom releases a new device every 3 or 4 months. You can't expect all of the features to work on all of them before we release them.\"\" Yes. That's a direct quote. And yes TomTom, that's EXACTLY what I and the rest of your customers expect. If it doesn't work, don't take people's money for it. Period.With business practices and products like this, I am appalled that TomTom is still in business. If you MUST buy a TomTom for some reason, you might want to consider a model that's been around awhile. Maybe they've gotten around to making it work by now.Update 5/6/2011: After only owning this device a week and using it a handful of times, my unit died. I dropped it into the windshield mount and hit the power button while I buckled and backed out of the driveway and when by the end of my street (3 blocks) it was still on the start-up image, I was perplexed. I turned it off and back on with the same result. I left it on, thinking perhaps it was updating some database or something and would eventually move on, but when I arrived at my destination 20 minutes later, it was still displaying the startup image. A Google search of reset instructions led me to hold the power button down for an extended period, which according to TomTom's service instructions, should have initiated a soft reset. Instead, it powered down completely and I have not been able to power it back on since. TomTom tech support confirms that there is clearly something wrong with this unit and have issued an RMA with a promise of a replacement unit. I will update my review after receiving the replacement to indicate how the RMA process went. Have I mentioned that I'm underwhelmed here?Update 6/16/2011: As promised, here is my update on the RMA process. Turnaround time was quick. I received my shipping notice about a day and a half after TT received my defective unit. Yesterday, I received a brand-new unit, complete with accessories. I was pleasantly surprised, as I had expected (although would have been unhappy with) a reconditioned unit. So far, so good on the replacement. We'll see if this one fares better than the last. If did have to download a significant amount of updates, so hopefully this was a firmware bug that is now remedied. Only time will tell.Update 2/7/2012: I've been using the replacement unit for over 6 months now so I thought it time for an update. The new unit has definitely fared better than the original, but only marginally so. While it has continued to work without the complete mental breakdown my first device suffered, it does reboot itself for no reason about once every 10 uses or so. Firmware updates have not addressed any of my other complaints either, such as lack of functioning downloads, ability to control the device from your computer, or the impossibly small voice control button (among others). I forgot to mention in previous updates, because I hadn't had a lot of experience with the unit at that point, that the \"\"traffic\"\" is abysmal (at least in the Detroit area). After approximately 7 months of semi-regular use (I use it a lot mostly for the Bluetooth function), I have not once seen any of the traffic events reported by TomTom. It will indicate an accident or road construction or other such delay along my route and I will smirk as I drive past the supposed event with no sign of anything out of the ordinary. Alternately, it has yet to save me a single instance of being caught in a traffic event. Imagine my disgust when on 3 separate occasions I have been stuck in traffic jams in excess of 30 minutes that were never reported at all by TomTom. Add to this the fact that at least once a week it never syncs up to the traffic service at all and you'll understand why I continue to stand by my original assessment of this unit.\"", "\"I've been using this unit for 10 weeks.  My main interest is for use when I'm traveling where I use it both for directions and POI's.  Great way to find a restaurant when you're in strange territory.  I've used it in the US and Ontario, Canada.  No differences.Up front, I have not experienced the problems other reviewers have documented.  I did not try to change the \"\"standard\"\" voice.  It connected to my home computer without problems.  It syncs to satellites quickly, usually within 15 seconds or so, which is fine for me.  The learning curve was 5 minutes with the manual.  Setting a destination is a slightly different sequence, and a little less intuitive than my old Nuvi, but not an issue.Pros:  Big, bright screen that's easy to see even through dark sun glasses.  Voice recognition, which is of course \"\"hands-free\"\" and a potential life saver, literally. The other thing about voice recognition is that you can start driving and call out the data, rather than punching it in before you drive (or while driving); that's a time saver.  I have no issue with the size of the voice recognition button and it's no big deal to be sure it's on before I drive. Other audio devices, such as the car radio, need to be completely off, not just turned low, for the voice recognition to work.Directions are accurate (mostly, see below)and the lane assist works very well once you understand the terminology.  The \"\"voice\"\" for driving directions is clear and loud.  It has a \"\"night screen\"\" that's black and white that was a pleasant and terrific surprise.  The display information is comprehensive; the time to destination is constantly updated and reasonably accurate. The mount to the windshield is easy to use and has worked well without any failure or difficulty.Cons (minor): The \"\"on\"\" button requires paying attention, a minor irritation.  It is thin and I'm sure designed so you won't accidentally turn it on if you store it. (My Nuvi was the opposite, you had to pay attention to be sure you didn't turn it on when you were storing it.)  There has to be some happy compromise.  The TomTom does not come with a case, I bought their standard case with magnetic closure and am happy with it, but for the price another $15 for a case seems steep, on the other hand I understand many people may not stick it in a brief case for travel.  I prefer a weighted dash mount that can easily be place out of sight and the TomTom solution is to stick the suction cup on a flat surface on a weighted dash mount.  My prior experience with that type of mount is that the suction mount doesn't hold consistently. Since for traveling to other countries, the TomTom requires \"\"changing countries\"\" before you can enter a destination in the new country.  That has to be done before you can enter a destination.  A bit awkward.I've had one consistent direction glitch entering a large, private industrial area.  The TomTom has the streets, but at one point it consistently tells me to \"\"turn left, then turn around at the first opportunity.\"\"  The directions come well before the turn, and a simple right turn and it's back on the correct path.  Odd, but tolerable.  Update: I've had two more misdirections, both on freeway splits where the directions given were opposite of what was correct until it was too late to safely correct.  Now it's getting irritating.As GPS units go, this is pricey.  I did not subtract any stars because the voice recognition is so much less distracting and the price is not a hidden surprise.Good tool; I'm happy.\"", "\"My experience with vehicle based GPS is limited; I have a Garmin eTrex which I use for walking (love it) and I have an old Magellan with a tiny dim barely-viewable screen that got put in a draw a while back and hasn't seen the light of day since. With regards to the TomTom GO 2535TM the first thing you notice is the 5\"\" screen.  It's beautiful, possibly on par with the iPad's LCD, and thanks to its massive viewing angle and super bright clear display I can see it from almost anywhere. No complaints about the screen. Of course since it's so big many of the existing TomTom accessories such as bicycle/motorbike holders may not work with it. I do see new accessories being released recently for five inch screens so hopefully it becomes the de-facto standard size for GPS handhelds. The twist-on sucker window mount and magnetic holder work perfectly and despite romping along the surface of the moon (I'm referring to the god-awful roads we have in Pennsylvania) nothing was dislodged.Navigation and finding POI is standard stuff here. I really didn't see any major difference in functionality between this and my aging Magellan, I'm mean sure the graphics are fancier and you can pick your car icon graphic to match your ride etc but it's all still fairly simple. Plop in your destination or tell it you want to go home or get gas or go eat and it tells you where to drive. Simple.Booting the device and finding satellites (for me at least) is very quick. By the time you've pulled out of your drive the GPS is instructing you where to turn. I haven't seen the nasty wait times that others have witnessed and I guess that's down to the luck of the draw as to where you are. It would be nice to see a 'heat map' of good coverage spots like you can with cellphones but given that it could be talking to twelve satellites out of how ever many are up there at any one time that may be out of the question.I did have one problem and that was voice control. I'm a displaced Brit and if I talk in my normal accent it simply would not understand me - not even a no or yes. Having been here for 14 years I can fake a fairly convincing American accent and when I do so it understands every word! Now this is an amusing point for me but might have potential consequences for others. If you have a serious speech impediment or heavy foreign accent et al you may be telling the device one thing and it might be understanding another. Now it does confirm with you what you said but it's definitely something to keep an eye on if you're in the aforementioned situation. Just something to note so you don't end up far away from your destination especially if a maternity ward is on your driving itinerary!Another complaint, and for this it lost a star, was its handling of battery drain. Not the battery life, that's great, but how it deals with the battery running out in the middle of your journey. I deliberately tested this and in a nutshell... it doesn't handle it well at all. You get a quick battery icon flash about two minutes before it dies and then it dies. I realize most people will be running this off the included cigarette lighter for permanent power but for those who don't do that please keep in mind that there's no audible warning when it's going to switch off. If you don't happen to be paying attention to it at the right moment then you may not know it's about to go silent and will be left wondering why you're no longer hearing directions or seeing a route. I'm confused as to why it doesn't follow a partial shutdown - why doesn't it grade the brightness of the screen or shut the screen off completely and just delivery audio for the last 5% of battery life for example? At least that might get you home.All in all though this is a very nice bit of kit and I'm happy to recommend it.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.14637070894241333, 0.00026305741630494595, 0.01099446602165699, 0.11508800834417343, 0.0029944973066449165, 0.0021376516669988632, 0.0019139311043545604, 0.0011574019445106387, 0.3696385324001312, 0.12851493060588837, 0.2083253115415573, 0.00016130341100506485, 0.0018476586556062102, 0.00033521957811899483, 0.00019159475050400943, 0.0007458949112333357, 0.00894247367978096, 0.0003773230127990246]]}
