On plugging into my MacBook Pro 2010 model it worked immediately. Picture was fantastic and clear. Built from a sturdy plastic and nice length to reach couch to tv.", "Connection with the cable was wobbly. Cable had to be jiggled to get a video signal. Audio was horribly choppy.In contrast the Tera Grand Mini Display Port to HDMI adapter that I had to order because this didn't work worked perfectly the second it was plugged in.Go with that for your Surface. This cable is obviously cheap in construction, not just price.", "\"Worked fine to connect a Lenovo laptop w/ DisplayPort output to a 1920x1200 monitor. Also worked great - audio as well - connecting to two different HD-TVs, Sony and Panasonic.A tip for connecting to HD-TVs: most of these apparently come preset to \"\"over-scan\"\" (artifact from CRT days) - for cable TV you would hardly notice but with a PC display the menu bar, task bar, etc. are cut off. Both the Sony and Panasonic had menu settings (called out differently by each manufacturer) to reset the display to show the entire 1920x1080 image. Once reconfigured the PC display looked great.\"", "I LOVE this.  Think carefully about how many feet of HDMI cable you want.  I hook this up to my 2011 MacBook and it works just fine in every way.  At first I bought a 6 foot cord and I hated it being so far away from the couch; it was a pain.  With 15ft, you can surf the internet while streaming on the television.  Great, high quality product at a fair price!", "\"Wanted to use this to connect my MacBook Air laptop to my Sony TV. Noted decent quality of the cable and connectors so I was hopeful it would be a great way to see HBO2GO on my 53\"\" XBR. Did the connection without any problems but could not get the picture or audio to come up. Tried the same hook up, settings, etc. with the Belkin connector purchased in the Apple Store and everything worked fine. Not certain why this didn't work but just didn't.\"", "I've got this cable running from a Mini DisplayPort on a high-end Lenovo to a 40&#34; screen that is mounted on a wall about 8 feet from my desk.  This cable runs down through a floor box, along a crawl space and up through the opposite wall to come out of a DataComm 45-0002-WH 2-Gang Recessed Low Voltage Cable Plate along with some other cabling.  It works great.  I have no complaints and would purchase again.", "I have seen friends use other products, either VGA to HDMI, or USB to HDMI, and none of them have performed better than the Thunderbolt to HDMI. Of course, Thunderbolt performs 20 times faster than USB 2.0 and even twice as fast as USB 3.0, so this performance difference is almost expected.It also negates the need for any adapters which is a huge bonus. There is some distortion if you are displaying to a significantly larger display, however, it is much less than other products and can even be overlooked at time. This product is highly recommended.", "Works as expected, no video issues, quality seems to be good.  I have a monoprice cable that is identical in every way except the branding.", "Bought this as a gift for my sister and she tells me it works great. If you look at my other reviews you'll see I bought a different version of this cable for myself and it didn't work at all, so this can be very hit or miss, but this brand is top notch. Solid price too.", "\"I'm using this to connect a 2012 MacBook Air and 36\"\" Toshiba Monitor/TV. No problems so far. I bought this not knowing if I had a bad cable or loose port on my MBA. This new cable works great so I'm guessing it was my old cable that was bad.I had to tweak the 'underscan' setting 'Display' on my MBA in order to fit the entire screen with 1080p. But, it works great. I'll update my review if I run into issues with this cable. At this price, this is a very good deal.Sounds works over HDMI too - very nice. Having both audio/video on a single cable is fantastic.\"", "this product failed form day one . I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and tried again and again. It will have strange static / noise on the scree. I am using a 2011 MBA. DO NOT BUY , WASTE OF MONEY ! I as out of town for the return period and now i get to keep a very over priced paper weight.", "i have the cords running from a Macbook to a Sharp smart tv and the cords have worked well so far.  Audio works after playing with the settings in preferences.  Video looks nice and clean!", "But honestly, the awesome is from what i am doing with it, not the cable so much. Although i can say that the fit to my thunderbolt port is nice and tight, and the cable has no digital noise (white sparklies) even though it is a 15 footer. And it's white, so it looks like all my other mac cables, helpful for distinguishing it from the tangle of black USB cables that ran amok in my house during the oughts.Biggest bonus besides portable photo gallery to HD TV: TV as second monitor with audio passed over the HDMI to the real audio gear.", "This works perfectly. With a 2011 MacBook Air, audio and video are both routed to a Sony Bravia TV.My only complaint is that the cable is much stiffer than other HDMI cables I've used. That makes it difficult to route neatly, and it doesn't stay in place when I unplug it from the laptop unless I do something to tether it in a couple places near the end.", "The cable shorted out and failed after about 3 or 4 months. Even though it was outside the return window, they refunded me the cost, so I give 5 stars for the customer support aspect. I found out I like having an adapter instead of a dedicated cable because if it fails its easier to replace, but thats just me.", "\"Since the most recent video firmware update on my MacBook Core i5 (MacBookPro6,2) I started having issues with some \"\"generic\"\" adapters and I was reluctant to purchase this thinking I might have issues.  I'm happy to report that this cable worked perfectly right out of the box and my Mac quickly detected my TV's resolutions and capabilities without any issue.  I can not comment regarding audio, however, since my MacBook does not support audio over DisplayPort.\"", "Can't beat the price really, but the cable came straight out of the bag with a pretty nasty kink in it.  Works fine though.  Cable is MUCH stiffer than expected, stiffer than solid (non-stranded) Cat-5e.", "This cable works great with my mini mac and my new samsung monitor tv. The signal is steady and never goes out.", "I'm glad I got this pup because it just makes it so much easier using the big screen HD in the living or bedroom while using the Surface Pro 2.  I'm glad I got it and am very happy with the quality of the product.  As with anything, as long as you care for it (comes with caps) it will last you forever.", "I Found the same kind of cable for much higher price in everywhere. Its working really good and an amazing product.its strong and length of the cable is really acceptable. I liked it a lot.Thanks to the manufactures and shipping was so early.", "I connected my MacBook Pro to my LCD TV and 5.1 surround sound via an Yamaha receiver using this cable.  It works great.  Not only the image quality is high, the 5.1 surround sound works like a charm.  Now I can render 5.1 surround sound in Adobe Audition and preview it live.  This cable is a must for video and 5.1 surround sound editing.", "I have my HDTV connected to my PC graphics card and it works great with this long cable.  Lets me live stream to my TV, play games on it, and watch blu-rays. great picture just like HDMI but no sound. I use a separate optical cable for sound that also goes to my receiver.
