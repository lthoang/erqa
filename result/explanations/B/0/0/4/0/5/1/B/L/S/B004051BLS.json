"], "reviews": ["\"Yogi tea has been one of my favorite brands over the years. It does not disappoint-- neither does \"\"Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea\"\" -- it IS just that: refreshing. In my experience, it was tasty, and gave me a pleasant jolt, and extra energy.It tastes great with my favorite sweet treats, and I would not be surprised if it could be a great ingredient (strongly brewed) in cookies or even cakes. Try adding Vanilla Soy or Rice (or Almond) milk to this -- on the rocks or hot -- it will be DELISH!!!Approximately 40% (or more) of the ingredients are organic; and \"\"each tea bag contains 70mg caffeine, as compared to approximately 90 mg oin 8 oz of coffee.\"\"Each tea bag is also individually wrapped-- which is very nice -- grab a few teabags and stuff into pocket or purse or luggage on your way out the door / traveling/ whatever.The ingredients are impressive - Peppermint leaf, Assam Black leaf Tea, combined with other ingredients including Black pepper, Kola Nut (contains caffeiene), Guarana Seed (also contains caffeine) and Clove Bud (which has \"\"warming\"\" properties, according to Oriental medicine).The box is atttracitve, and also has a \"\"Yoga to Get Fired Up\"\" position described on the side-- the choice of ink color on some parts of the box could be much better -- light brown ink on a yellow background is not highly legible, and for that and ONLY for that -- I give it four stars -- it does not come though, on paper, with its message as well as I think it should.In summation, this pleasant and enjoyable beverage is something I would GLADLY serve to my guests - but it is not a tea I would choose to drink at night -- unless I needed to stay up a little later than usual -- it tastes GREAT, and really does impart a Wonderful \"\"Zing\"\" and a nice caffeine \"\"kick\"\".UPDATE March 2012- I liked this tea so much I bought 6 boxes of it from Amazon-- and am still enjoying it as we speak.\"", "\"This was a very interesting flavor experience for me. I expected the mint to be the first flavor to hit my tongue and to be overpowering. Instead a few of the low notes came on first. I was actually wondering, \"\"Where is the mint flavor?\"\" and then it came rolling in. This mint flavor is clean, clear and yet very light.I'm enjoying this understated take on mint tea.Note: Even though this contains Stevia, I still needed to add a little raw sugar.\"", "\"This tea has the sweet smell of the Peppermint and Spearmint leaf and the strong taste of the Ginger Root, Cinnamon Bark and Black tea. It also contains Cardamom Seed, healthy Green tea Leaf Extract, Stevia Leaf, Kola Nut, Guarana Seed and Clove Bud, all ingredients are Organic. There is also 77mg of caffeine (an 8oz cup of coffee is about 90mg) which I'm guessing is where the \"\"energy\"\" comes from. Each tea bag is sealed in it's own envelope and easily makes a 16oz - 20oz cup of tea. So I get much less caffeine than an equal amount of coffee.I'm a big Tea drinker but I've never tasted anything like this before. It's very unusual and It's good. I would purchase it again and recommend it other tea drinkers.\"", "Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea - I love it so much, I cannot tell you how much I love it!!!  This refreshing, minty, delicious tea is awesome.  It hits the spot.  It goes well with lots of foods, as well as by itself.  It is strong and minty - just perfect.I put a teabag or two in a glass of water.  The tea is strong, so before the drink is finished, I have to add more water.  It is perfect and delicious.  I don't usually put sugar in my tea, but for those people who do, sugar would be nice.  I usually just drink my tea straight.  I love tea with most all of my foods.Cornbread and ice tea is my favorite combination - even this minty tea goes good with cornbread.  In fact, it goes good with almost any food.Just a glass of tea, or a glass of tea with a brownie or cookie also is a wonderful combination.  This minty tea goes with almost everything, from cornbread to brownies.I am not usually a hot tea drinker.  I usually drink mine cold or iced.  But I know lots of people drink their tea hot.  This minty tea would be really awesome if it were hot.  Hot, minty tea sounds perfect and soothing and warm and even healing.I am so grateful that I got to find out about this tea.  I love it so much, and now you can bet it will be a regular in my kitchen cupboards.  Now that I know about it, there is no separating me from it.", "We drink a lot of tea at our house and I've had about every brand of mint there is.  Some are quite strong but this blend is a more subtle blend of mints that would be impossible not to like.  My daughter adds a bag to a tall glass of water, waits a short time and enjoys it as a cold mint drink.  I prefer hot tea, so pour boiling water over the bag, steep for a few minutes and then sip.  Each of us leaves the bag in while drinking, and my daughter really likes the string and tag because they aid her in keeping control of the bag while drinking.  I also like the foil pouch it comes in, as I can keep a teabag or two in my purse so that when I'm visiting a friend I can enjoy a cup of my own tea, even if they don't have any flavors I like.  The foil bag is very strong so does not come apart in my purse, and keeps the tea fresh.Update: I've been drinking this for a couple of weeks now on a daily basis.  It took me until early this morning to make the connection that during the same period of time, I have been having difficulty getting to sleep.  I finally checked the ingredients list more carefully and noticed two ingredients designed to keep you awake.  First is black tea, which contains caffeine.  Second is guarana.  I have some experience with guarana and am perhaps more sensitive to it than most, but I cannot sleep when taking it.  Yesterday I drank a cup of tea at 3pm and went to bed exhausted at midnight.  By 4am - 13 hours after drinking the tea! - I was still wide awake.  So it is not that I'm drinking it right before going to bed - I'm drinking the tea during the late morning to mid-afternoon time period and it is still wreaking havoc with my sleep patterns.  I'm so glad to have figured this out and wish I'd known it earlier as quite honestly, it would have factored into my rating of the product, which I am now unable to change.  So - buyer beware.  By all means try it but be aware that it might keep you up more than you want it to.", "I love all teas  - hot, cold, you name it. When I'm in the mood for a mint tea, I select Bigelow Mint Medley. I find it has a nice smooth mint flavor. Since that is the mint tea I usually drink, I wondered how Yogi would compare to it.The two teas have different ingredients. Bigelow's ingredients are peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus. Yogi is organic peppermint leaf, organic Assam black tea leaf, organic spearmint leaf, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, green tea extract, organic black pepper, kola nut, guarana seed, organic clove bud, stevia leaf.I seeped both teas for the same amount of time - approximately 5 minutes (Bigelow recommends seeping for 3-5 minutes. Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend. There's also a mild tingly sensation after drinking the tea (very very mild tingling). Overall, I found the Yogi tea tasted better and I enjoyed it more.I don't know the accuracy of its claims to get your chi moving. However, this is a great tasting mint tea.", "Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea is a minty and slightly spicy tea that includes green tea, black tea, organic peppermint, kola nut, guarana seed, ginger, and cinnamon. This tea is formulated, according to the manufacturer, to get your chi moving; that is, to improve your overall energy and well- being.First, let's talk about the taste. This mint tea is minty more than anything and a few minutes of steeping is more than enough to bring out the full, mint flavor. The mixture of green and black teas is evident, too, although not as obvious as the flavor of mint. And, if you search, you can detect the added spices. The cinnamon flavor is certainly there, but I admit that I had a hard time finding the other flavors, like the ginger.As for energy, well, I agree that I feel more energized after drinking two cups of this tea, but I can't say the credit goes to the basic ingredients. A more likely culprit is the caffeine, which is higher in this tea than in other teas.I love a good cup of tea and Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize is certainly a tasty tea with plenty of fresh mint taste. It might be a bit much for those who prefer to taste tea rather than mint, but I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to those who love the refreshing and uplifting combination of green and black tea with peppermint and other spices.", "I have purchased a few other Yogi brand teas, and so far I like them all.  (I have Mayan Cocoa Spice - awesome, vanilla hazelnut - pretty good, and Mexican Sweet Chili - odd but tasty).  I'm not the world's biggest fan of mint, but this is pretty good nonetheless.  It's not super strong mint, but it's more than just an aftertaste.I'm not sure how revitalized I was after drinking it.  I brought it to work to drink around 2:00 when I usually want to take a nap or at least go home, and while I still wanted to go home, I didn't feel like napping was imminent.  That said, I wasn't up to dancing in the aisles either.  I probably perked up a little.This is not my favorite tea, but it's a good mint tea.  I suspect it would be good iced, but I haven't tried that yet - still a bit chilly out.  If you want 6 boxes of tea, Amazon's price is exceptional.  And organic means that less poisons were dumped into the environment to make it, so that's always a good thing.", "There's a place for this bold tea in my cupboard.  This tea really does not fit a typical category because it mixes black tea, green tea extract, kola nut and an array of spices.  The spices overpower the black tea so much that I'm unable to sense the percentage of black tea.  Given the long list of ingredients, I suspect black tea is a small percentage.  Bear in mind it also contains kola nut which is loaded with caffeine.At first I taste peppermint, the first ingredient.  After that I sense the black pepper and cinnamon, then the ginger and finally clove.  For a complicated mixed tea, the note of clove is pleasant to me.  However, I experience a long-lasting aftertaste that is like slippery elm with foot-stomping black pepper added.  While it contains black pepper, it does not have slippery elm.  It has spearmint, which I don't notice at all.While this tea seems to defy categorization, I'd suggest using it as a Morning Thunder option.  It has 77 mg of caffeine, and I normally double up my tea bags so that's 154 mg of caffeine for me.  That compares with 1.71 - 8 ounce cups of coffee, or a 13.69 oz. cup of coffee.", "I love anything mint, so I've found the combination of black tea, peppermint and spearmint to be delicious. The addition of cardamom and ginger add an interesting flavor. The stevia adds just a light touch of sweetness. There's 77mg of caffeine in this tea, which is a little more than the average cup of black tea and a little less than a cup of coffee. I feel it helps with my energy level without the jittery feeling I get from coffee or caffeinated energy drinks. I often drink herbal mint teas, but when I want the energy boost of a black tea, this refreshing and minty tea is perfect.", "My favorite tea isYogi Green Tea Mint Garden, which is just green tea and some mint.  It's great.  So, with an opportunity for a new, somewhat similar type of tea, I was excited that it sounded almost like a cross between Chai Tea and their own Mint Garden.  And I wasn't disappointed.To me, this tastes like a cross between their Mint Garden tea andOregon Chai, Original.  It's not sweetened by itself (OK, maybe a little with the Stevia leaf, but it's a very robust tea that has all the mint, plus all the spiciness of chai teas.  Overall, the taste is excellent.The only downside I can think of is somewhat personal:  I enjoy drinking tea at nighttime, and this contains a fairly hearty code of caffeine:  just under a cup-of-coffee amount.  So, this tea is perfect for everything, except nighttime drinking.Would recommend.", "Well this tea was not what I expected. I was hoping for a minty coco flavor. I wanted to like this tea, but I just did not. It had a strange after taste that I could not shake. Too many flavors for real mint, it gave it a dirty funny taste. I think they tried to do too much here. I see where others loved it, I just did not. I don't think I can drink anymore of it. Be cautioned if your looking for a minty, chocolate tasty treat, this is not it. Too many flavors give it a muddy strange taste. I'm sure I will get slammed for my opinion, people hate people who disagree with them here on Amazon, but in good conscience I could not rate this any better.", "\"Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea has effects summed up by the name:  it is refreshing, minty, and it will revitalize you.Produced by the Yogi tea company, this tea is a black tea that includes green tea extract.  It includes peppermint leaf which gives it its refreshing minty taste.  It also includes a long list of herbal additives, which could actually do something for you, or could be a bit of a marketing tactic.  There were 2 that stood out for me:  guarana and kola nut.  Guarana provides guaranine, which is similar to caffeine.  Kola nut is another source of caffeine.  The 77mg of caffeine in each cup of tea does not include the stimulant effect provided by guarana and kola nut.  If you are hoping for a stimulant effect less than coffee, beware.  A cup of this tea actually contains more stimulants than a typical cup of coffee.  That said, its worth noting that the jitters that typically accompany a cup of coffee are absent here.  It has a nice \"\"sharpening\"\" effect without the upset stomach and jitters that a good cup of coffee can produce.The tea comes in a nice cardboard recyclable box, with some yoga breathing exercises designed to wake you up on the side.  Each tea bag includes some yogi advice, sort of like a fortune cookie.  When the box is first opened, the smell is reminiscent of weak chewing gum, but don't let that put you off: each cup of tea is boldly minty and refreshing.  The taste is every bit as delicious as other mint teas on the market.Whether the mid-afternoon blahs are caused by your chi being stuck, or by a post-prandial insulin surge, a cup of this tea will definitely get you going.  It is refreshing and delicious, does not require a sweetener (contains a tiny amount of stevia already) and will give you a lift.Just don't drink it too late in the afternoon or you might be scrubbing floors at midnight.\"", "This tea not only delivers a little energy boost, but it has a really nice flavor--the mint is quite strong (maybe overwhelming for some), but it feels really great going down--very refreshing. I usually drink it hot, but this would be awesome iced on a summer day, especially with the cooling effect it has.I definitely recommend this over coffee, which may give a stronger burst of energy initially but wears away more quickly and can give you the jitters. Tea is definitely a better way to feel alert for a longer time without that hyper feeling, not to mention its other health benefits like antioxidants.", "This tea is great for a pick me up in the afternoon. The mint tea is fairly robust. I particularly enjoy it when it's cold outside and I can hold a warm mug and breathe in the lovely aroma of minty goodness. I really like all the Yogi brands of tea -- I think it's quality tea at a good price.", "I'm a big tea drinker and am quite fond of Yogi teas for their taste and quality.This tea is no exception.I was a tad wary that having black tea mix with mint might result in minty bitterness, but that wasn't the case at all. The box recommends steeping for 4 minutes, but I chose 2 to be on the safe side.  I could have easily gone with 4, though as the tea had no hint of bitterness.I found it to be refrshing and just the right amount of pick me up for the evening. I drink decaf everything about 90% of the time so the low caffeine amount in this tea did affect me. I may have actually drank it too close to bedtime though as I did get that whooshing in the ears sound that normally only happens after caffeine for me.All told, I definitley enjoy this tea, but will likely keep it to mornigpng or early afternoon use.", "\"I am not normally a fan of mint teas.  They usually smell great, but are very weak tasting, no matter how much you steep.  This is the first mint tea I have ever come across that has a black and green tea base, instead of just a green tea base.  What a difference!  The Assam really kicks the tea up a notch without overpowering the mint at all.  It has a lovely aroma, and a nice strong flavor.  I can't say whether I felt \"\"revitalized\"\" or \"\"invigorated\"\" but it tasted great and that's the most important thing.  It has such a great flavor, I tried it as an iced tea and found it was fantastic.  Very refreshing!Since this is marketed as \"\"health tea,\"\" I have not been able to find any Yogi flavors in a regular grocery store.  It is available in vitamin shops (online and brick and mortar), and similar outlets.  Though it is a trifle expensive compared to regular tea at almost $4, I would definitely buy it again.  Since it takes several bags to make a pitcher of iced tea, it is worth it to subscribe for me, which also brings the price down.  Highly recommended!I also enjoyed theYogi Purely Peppermint, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6), which is great for upset stomachs.\"", "\"When I ordered this tea I was expecting a very nice, refreshing and revitalizing mint tea to mix with a bit of organic cocao powder for my minty chocolate tea treat.  However, even though Yogi boxed this with the title \"\"Refresing Mint Revitalize Tea\"\", it really isn't minty.  The flavor is very spicy.  So much so that I was really shocked by the flavor.  I LIKED the flavor, but it certainly isn't the tea that I thought I was buying by the box cover.  The ingredients are;  Peppermint and Spearmint leaves with black and green tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, Cardamom, Black Pepper, Kola Nut, Clove Bud and Guarana Seed.  All tasty if you want a spicy kick in the butt get a move on tea, but not a revatilizing mint tea.  I give it 3 stars because I believe that the title is misleading.  Refreshing mint doesn't sound like black pepper and cardamom to me.\"", "Ever had Bigelow's peppermint tea? The flavor really beats you over the head. That's why we tend to stay away from such teas in my household (the reason I would drink them is because they were decaf...I'm rather sensitive to caffeine).Yogi's mint tea does not beat you over the head. It doesn't pound your tongue with mint flavor. It's like a gentle massage, giving you the slightest hint/trace of mint.The only problem: it has caffeine. Oh well, can't win them all. Recommended.", "\"There is no way, of course, for a consumer to rate the claims Yogi makes of detoxification, of how one would know if her \"\"chi\"\" is stuck.  But the mint does make this tea refreshing.  A user should also note that it could be the caffeine, since the packaging acknowledges that this tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, While the box suggests drinking \"\"cup after cup\"\" to enhance performance, your sensitivity to caffeine should be taken into account.\"", "\"I have no idea whether this tea actually \"\"detoxes\"\" my system, nor can I tell if any extra energy I feel after drinking it is due to the caffeine or the other ingredients. It is, however, a lovely, delicious tea that's become a highlight of my day. When hot, it's perfect for a frosty winter day (and goodness knows we've had a lot of those this year!), but it also makes a wonderful iced tea that I'm looking forward to enjoying this summer.I'd never have thought to put black pepper in a tea, but its combination with mint really gives a nice 'zing' that's made even better with a bit of honey, agave nectar or Stevia. That said, my husband didn't like the combination nearly as much and pronounced it \"\"too minty\"\", whereas I found after a couple of sips that the ginger and kola nut tastes were more pronounced.At any rate, it's a great tea that's just different enough to merit its own place in your tea box.\"", "Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea makes a reasonable strong cup of tea with just a couple minutes steeping. The taste of the tea however is overwhelmed by the spice note, most notably the black pepper and the mint. While the pepper gives a nice warmth to the beverage the rest of the spice family sticks around far too long. I was tasting this tea hours after drinking it. The aftertaste was mildly unpleasant.I don't know that the few cups I've had so far revitalized me. The brew has far less caffeine than a decent cup of coffee so it didn't perk me up any more than any other tea or coffee. I just wasn't impressed. There are far better mint teas out there. I think the only time I might enjoy this tea is if I had a cold or the flu.", "\"I usually drink non-caffeine herb tea and just plain mint is one of my favorites. I can't stomach chamomile, so I'm pleased this tea does not have that ingredient.  I'm not sure that I feel more \"\"energized', but as it has caffeine, I'm sure I'm not sleepier. (-: According to the box it ha 77 mg of caffeine, which compares to 90 g in 8 oz of coffee. Overall, I like the taste and the smell. I have several other boxes of Yogi tea in the cupboard and as I usually drink tea at night, I'm more likely to reach for those at home. I think I'll leave this one at the office and we can have a cup when the coffee pot is empty, but we wish there was one more cup.One of my friends thought the first sip was a bit of a medicine-y taste shock, but she said it kind of grew on her. Also, she said it leaves a nice aftertaste. Another friend thought it was \"\"softer\"\" than regular black tea and it's not very bitter. Overall, we like it.\"", "\"Am I the only one who loves a strong, mint tea?  With the name Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, I expect more zing. Anyway, the taste  of this black tea after it steeps for quite awhile is really wonderful, almost spicy.  I drink iced tea, sometimes with Stevia, sometimes not.For anyone getting off soda, this is great.  I leave  the bags in with the ice while I sip for hours out of my large \"\"sippy\"\" tumbler.  I just boil water and put 2-3 cups water to heat until hot.  I put 3 tea bags and steep, then pour over ice.  The \"\"pot\"\" of tea lasts me all day.Enjoy your organic caffeine tea!\"", "\"I'm sitting here at 10:40 at night and probably have no business drinking anything with Revitalize in the name that informs me it has black tea and \"\"energizing\"\" (in italics, no less) herbs, and yet...I picked this because I'm a tea person -- hot tea, ice tea... I'd also purchased this brand -- Yogi -- before from the health food co-op and have been pretty happy.I drink my tea unsweetened and I have to say I think this is very tasty and minty. Not only can you taste the mint, but it leaves pleasantly lingering taste, and -- if this makes any sense -- it always feels like I've been using Vicks, that warmness. Even though the Yogi people are not specifically claiming this, I'd make this if I were feeling a little under the weather and congested, I think it would work nicely.It has ginger and cinnamon bark in it as well, which are not only great for the immune system but two of my favorite flavors. I mentioned drinking tea unsweetened, and I think that's an even better decision when there's a little spice in the mix, not to mention stevia which adds a hint of natural sweetness. Mint is definitely the predominant flavor, but I believe the ginger and cinnamon add a little richness and stop that strong mint flavor from being off-putting.Do I feel revitalized? Unfortunately -- it's now 10:45 PM -- a little  bit, definitely. It seems like it would be a nice way to start the day or a midday boost, and I could see blearily talking my husband into making me a cup.I'd definitely buy this!\"", "...you have to be somewhat worried that this tea will have a medicinal taste or funky aftertaste.  Instead the taste is mellow and the bite of the mint comes in the aftertaste, for a more than satisfying cuppa.  I'm agnostic on the revitalizing effects, but thumbs up as far as relaxation.", "While I prefer coffee's flavor and body when I reach for a caffienated beverage in the morning, my afternoons often leave me slumpy. I've enjoyed herbal teas and suppliments as healthy alternatives since I was a toddler so I'm pretty open to trying something different when I have a problem like the caffiene shakes.I want to preface this review a little by saying I am a mint fanatic. It is one of my favorite flavors for sweets and teas. But the idea of mint and caffienated tea was foreign to me really. I don't care for green tea's after taste so I was a little leary of trying this one since it contains Green Tea Leaf Extract but thought I'd give it a whirl anyway. Lately I've been getting the shakes after my afternoon cup of coffee and I feel miserable for a while so I switched to this tea in hopes it would perk me up before hitting the gym without the nausea.Not only is this masterfully blended to be tastey I was completely shake free. I couldn't taste the green tea but the crisp mint and warm ginger notes were smooth. I dare say, though I didn't try it yet since it's winter, this would make a fantastic iced tea. The only issue I had with it is that I enjoyed it so much I let myself try a cup after dinner one night and was left wide awake and clear headed into the wee hours.I recommend this one for tea lovers who like a smooth mint tea or green tea as a refreshing afternoon pick-me-up (just not too late or you'll be up all night like I was). It should be noted though that this one and some other Yogi teas contain Stevia Leaf which is not considered safe during pregnancy. Check with your doctor to be sure, I know some say no caffiene at all while others say a little is okay.", "No better or worse than other teas. But it is pricey and you might find a better value out there - for example, my wife likes Stash Green Mint tea far better than this one.", "\"I received this from Vine then put it away in my cupboards, forgetting about it until I got sick this week with a cold. There is nothing more soothing to me than some mint tea with honey when I'm not feeling well.The aroma is wonderful. My husband, who pretty much only drinks green and jasmine tea, commented on how good it smelled. And while I don't know if it actually \"\"revitalized\"\" me, since I wasn't feeling well, I like the idea that it might. I also like that it has a black tea base, most mint teas are caffeine free and I do like a jolt of caffeine with my tea.It's a good tea with a great taste and aroma and something I will buy once this runs out.\"", "Mint is my favorite tea flavor and Yogi is especially good.  It's extra-minty and very refreshing.  As I write this review, I notice how my mouth tingles with minty-ness. This tea is smooth and refreshing.  I enjoyed it both hot and cold.", "It definitely gave me a nice lift in the afternoon, and helped me be more productive.Nice combination of herbs.  Enjoyed the flavor and especially like the Stevia sweetener.My only concern was that it was high in caffeine and I try to minimize my caffeine intake.I did a little test two days later and substituted a half a cup of coffee for the tea.The tea definitely revitalized me more.", "I love tea.  I am positively addicted.  But I have never been just crazy about mint tea.  It was fine, but I never really craved it.  Until this tea.  It is not mint in the true sense of the word.  If you read the ingredients, you will find that there are some unusual items in it, like cinnamon, that add a different taste, but it still tastes minty.  Also, there is stevia leaf included which means that the tea is naturally sweet and does not need extra sugar.  It was good hot, but I made a huge batch of iced tea with it and that was really delicious.  I will definitely buy this one again."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02081897482275963, 0.03301265463232994, 0.03586117923259735, 0.03607624024152756, 0.034219447523355484, 0.03247019648551941, 0.02911290153861046, 0.02381018176674843, 0.03374095261096954, 0.03444952890276909, 0.03275389224290848, 0.031053436920046806, 0.02727116458117962, 0.03231334686279297, 0.0361810177564621, 0.030186936259269714, 0.0325414314866066, 0.029288528487086296, 0.029398497194051743, 0.03004474937915802, 0.028438666835427284, 0.03154945746064186, 0.0278970617800951, 0.033892594277858734, 0.029793377965688705, 0.028242146596312523, 0.026908906176686287, 0.031607482582330704, 0.03382201865315437, 0.03293660655617714, 0.03458254411816597, 0.035723865032196045]]}
