Call it a protest statement if you will. The reason? I have a perfectly good composite cable that worked great on my old iPhone 3, I got the cable  a while ago from eBay(or from Amazon, I forget which), it was only $1.99 from Hong Kong . Now I have an iPhone 4, the cable no longer work on the latest iOS because Apple deliberately locks it out to force people to buy it's so called \"\"Optimized\"\" $39.00 cable. my perfectly good cable was left useless and collecting dust, one more piece of high tech trash. I am so disgusted by it, amazing how a multi billions company will go through such extreme step and sank so low to squeeze $39.00 from its customers. I have decided I am not going to the Apple Store to give them my $39.00 , So glad I found this, as it turns out this cable is actually better then the one from Apple Store.\"", "I recieved the video /av cable much sooner than expected and just as advertised, it work the first time! It even worked with iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. Now I can let my kids watch NetFlix and I don't have to worry about dead battery because you can connect external power to this unit for charging the iPhone.", "I found this cable while shopping for the Apple-branded A/V cables.  I wanted to display my iPhone 4 information on my big-screen TV. I purchased this cable because it includes BOTH composite and component video outputs and their associated cables for $39.00.  Apple charges about the same for its cables, but only supports one or the other of the video formats (one $38.00 cable for composite video, another $38.00 cable for component video).I did not have any problems with the device.  I should mention, however, that  not all video sources are supported.  For example, streaming Netflix and YouTube works just fine, but HULU and Crackle do not. Additionally, I could not display my iPhone photographs either (I have just read on a review that it will work if the photos are running in a slide show, so I will try that when I return home).Strangely enough, I launched an iPhone GPS application (MotionX GPS Drive), and the map DID display on my TV.  This only worked with the actual map; not any of the other screens. I then tried some games, but no video display.  I am assuming that these are restrictions from Apple, Inc., but I am only speculating.The advertisement for the cable only claims that it outputs audio and video, and it works as advertised.  The ability to take my Netflix streaming with me using only a small iPhone and the cable set is quite attractive, as it allows me to bring Netflix streaming to friends' homes-and nearly anywhere-with minimal effort.  Since I was grandfathered into AT&T;'s unlimited data plan, I can bring Netflix with me even if WiFi is not available!Anyone with an iPhone or iPad should own this cable set!", "The cable to install my ipod touch works and their isn't any problem with it so yeah it works for me.", "I have had no issues with these adapters. I have both a 1st Gen iPad ad 2nd Gen iPod Touch. The video out with this adapter is great. The quality of the video is as expected with standard definition. When using the component cables...the quality is definitely better. Great gadget for the price.", "I tried this on my iPhone 3GS and could not get it to work.  I e-mailed Skivia and got a response, followed the directions but still didn't work.  It's sitting on a shelf right now since I bought a Roku box.", "Well it works but it was hard to figure out which cables worked with which input area on my TV. Eventually I found out that this could plug into the part of my TV where one might plug in a video cam to watch a home movie (my inputs for that are on the side of my 4 year old Sony TV). Also, I find it doesnt read everything from my iphone. I imagined I would see the whole phone but it decides whats video and whats not. I was able to clearly see NetFlix though and it worked nicely. Its great that theres a feature to plug in a USB charge head (but you have to get your own chargehead)", "Use this to hook up iPod and iPad to older tv and RCA jacks on an old received.  This allows charging while you play via separate cord.  Would recommend for ultimate versatility.", "This works as advertised.  no worries.  2 or 3 years now (poor memory) that we go camping, I bring an Ipad, pick up wifi and the kids watch netflix whenever it rains.  great stuff if you're not into reading a book (with words) or playing a board game or talking to your family or ... you get the picture...", "\"I have a 160GB ipod classic and I couldn't get this product to work at all. I tried all the \"\"troubleshooting\"\" still a no go.\"", "I keep this in my backpack. I have the Directv Nomad app that allows me to put recorded shows on my ipod. With this cable, I can hook the ipod up to a tv when I'm away from home and watch my shows. It's really slick. Both sound and video look fine. It's not high def on the apps I use but for traveling this is fine. Also works with the NetFlix App."], "Gamma": [0.3531127870082855, 0.29377442598342896, 0.3531127870082855], "Beta": [[0.006581665948033333, 0.013867777772247791, 0.01003729272633791, 0.17324762046337128, 0.0006314472993835807, 0.07078060507774353, 0.19148866832256317, 0.12451207637786865, 0.053498778492212296, 0.16198202967643738, 0.19337201118469238], [0.006761783733963966, 0.013265002518892288, 0.010187606327235699, 0.17242741584777832, 0.0006765071302652359, 0.07110688835382462, 0.19087395071983337, 0.12422601878643036, 0.055691566318273544, 0.16141274571418762, 0.1933705061674118], [0.006581665948033333, 0.013867777772247791, 0.01003729272633791, 0.17324762046337128, 0.0006314472993835807, 0.07078060507774353, 0.19148868322372437, 0.12451207637786865, 0.053498778492212296, 0.16198202967643738, 0.19337201118469238]]}
