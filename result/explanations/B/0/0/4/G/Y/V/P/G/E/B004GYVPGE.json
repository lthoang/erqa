The reason why is that for what this device has to do it does a good job. Trying to draw on an iPad really requires something like this. And from what I hear and read many of these types of stylus fall apart. This one has served me well since I bought it. And for the price you'd think otherwise. Not so. This stylus lasts. But...I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 which has a regular WACOM style stylus. If you still have an iPad, you need a stylus like this one and this is the one I'd recommend. But if drawing is important to you, I'd drop the iPad and get the Galaxy Note 10.0\"\" which comes with a proper stylus. I can finally draw without zooming in and out to gain precision that the stylus lacks. Blame Steve Jobs for that as he seems to hate the idea of a stylus. But everyone in the art world lives and breaths with a stylus in the hands. I've been lusting after the Cintiq 24\"\" HD tablet since it came out.I think for artist types there are few good products out there for us. Cintiq is obviously one of them. The Galaxy Note 10.1 just became another. Thank you rooCASE, you've been great but I've finally found a proper system.\"", "We purchased this stylus to use with an iPad2. When we received it, the initial impression was that it was too short, but we feel it has a really nice length to make it easy to carry (even in your pocket), but not too small to be lost so easily.The tip works really well. We tried it with Autodesk Sketch and worked very well to perform fine lines, and draw freely on the screen. When navigating on the browser, you can select options and tick selections without having to zoom in and out constantly (like sometimes you have to do when using your fingers because the page is too big for the screen and gets resized).The miniplug dummy fits well in iPad so your stylus is handy when you need it. You could make the thread longer if you want to keep it attached and use it at the same time. The cord that comes with it is very durable and flexible, but it is only a couple of inches long (is is intended to be used as a lanyard for not loosing it, not a security cord like at the bank ;)For the price we bought it here at Amazon, we feel it is a very good option that works very well. We have used it only for about a week now. Maybe in a couple of months I'll come back here to write an update about tested durability and functionality after more use. So far, very good! recommended.", "The stylus is well-made and has a great soft tip that is easy on the screen. The extra feature of plugging it into the sound port is great for keeping track of it. No complaints here and it is definitely nice to use this with the Kindle Fire for certain tasks.", "This is a good sturdy stylus.  The pocket clip is very sturdy metal and will not break.  The rubber tip has not become loose or dislodged.  I can highly recommend this item.", "I bought this stylus so that i would be able to use my iPad better while at school.  This stylus is is very light weight and works very well.  I do wish that the tip was a little smaller as some have said but it works very well.  It is very comfortable in my hands and i have very large hands.  The headphone attachment is very useful as well and makes it so that i can not lose the stylus.  Overall this is a great stylus and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylus.", "The product does work and it feels pretty nice in the hand. It is decent quality, but the main issue is that the tip is so large, it is difficult to take notes with this - as the precision is just not there unless you write in big block letters. You also have to press down a bit hard for it to register. If you are looking for an ok stylus, then this will do, but there are better ones out there with finer tips.", "Nice stylus for my MyTouch 4G Slide. It makes the previously tedious task of swyping text (especially when the phone is held vertically and the letters are tiny) effortless with just the right amount of friction and spring. I finally hit all the keys correctly whereas before it was hit or miss. I do not want to use my phone without this stylus anymore - so, so easy to write emails and text messages with it...One star deduction for the clip: It is very rigid and in my opinion it is only a matter of time until it breaks off. Otherwise a very useful tool!", "\"I bought this stylus after purchasing a different brand as well.  Using a stylus is in some ways better than using your finger but sometimes it just seems like too much trouble to bother with one.This one works 75% of the time if you are doing letter by letter typing with it but you must press somewhat hard when doing so.  It is pretty bad when trying to use it with the swype keyboard.  It has pretty bad accuracy on the the swype keyboard.  I use the stylus on a 7\"\" Galaxy tab plus.  Seems like it would be good for navigating around the touchscreen but not so great for swyping, scrolling, or drawing.I'm not sure if I really like the idea of lugging around the stylus and I found that I either have to clip it to the folio case of the tablet in which I almost lost it the other day or plug it into the headphone jack where the stylus just smacks the folio from every which way.  I also wonder how long before it just decides to fall out of the headphone jack and it gets lost.  The cord is also too short.I would recommend it for some tasks but not all as it seems more aggrevating to use.\"", "I ordered a RooCase and this stylus was part of the package.  I figured it was an item for the recycle bin but it actually works.  I can write with this with very little downforce. For example, I sketch garden plans and measurements in an app using virtual graph paper and this really works well.  It doesn't stick, skip or drag like most I tried.  I wish it were longer and thinner imitating a pen shape but otherwise it's great!  Finally, I'm not going to have frozen fingers while making plans for spring:>)", "\"Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This low-priced rooCase stylus, which is 4-1/8\"\" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is an excellent, responsive stylus.Overall, the rooCase stylus is quite comparable to the BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus, although the capacitive tip is very slightly less sensitive and responsive.  Compared to other styluses that I tested, this stylus is short, has a wide barrel (wider than a pencil but narrower than a pen), and is light in weight.  I like the matte metallic red color, which is a little darker than the red of myrooCASE (Red) Leather Folio Case Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire.  Because of the wider barrel, the tip is wider, and not as accurate as some others for selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts).  However, pinpoint accuracy isn't important if you can enlarge the display on your touchscreen device.  Because I have large hands, I would prefer a longer stylus, but the overall performance of this stylus makes up for what it lacks in length.This stylus has a pocket clip, and a removable lanyard with a plastic tip that can be plugged into an earphones outlet to attach it to a touchscreen device.  Besides this stylus, I tested theMiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen, the BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus, theBoxWave Slimline Kindle Fire Stylus, theTargus Stylus for Apple iPad, and theAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices.  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4-1/4\"\" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity.  However,  I rate this stylus at 5 stars (\"\"I love it\"\"), because I like it nearly as well as the AmazonBasics stylus and the non-slimline BoxWave stylus, and it costs less.In case you're wondering, as I was, what a \"\"capacitive\"\" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses \"\"capacitive sensing\"\" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices.\"", "I have had this pen for more than a few months and it still works. It works great inside my rooCASE pouch. I use this for my Kindle Fire. Still going strong love it, great product.It is smaller than a pencil but thicker and easy to grip. I like that it has the option to either stick it in the head phone jacks or clip on something like a pen would.", "I use this at work with a touch screen that is often unresponsive to touch of fingers. This stylus much more reliable, seems to be accurate. I'm not using it for writing or drawing.", "This roocase stylus is absolutely essential for typing anything on an ipad or kindle fire hd screen keyboard.  Well made.", "I am new to the world of tablets and was happy to learn there is an alternative to my stubby fingers trying to navigate the tablet screen.Enter the rooCase stylus.  It has really made navigation a breeze and reduces  screen smudges from human skin contact.  It's a convenient accessory that may even give the user a sense of writing.  There is, at least to me, something magical about using a writing implement.  That 'something' is lost when using a touch screen.  Now the rooCase gives back that retro feeling.  This insane line of thinking can only come from somebody who spent thirty-two years using a red pen to correct student essays.  Although long retired from the classroom, I still can't lose the feeling of contentment embodied by holding a pen or pencil.  One of my first remembrances of school:  a small glass container of ink, in the inkwell at the right hand corner of  primary school desks.  That and wood pens with changeable nibs.  What's the point?  That's just it - there isn't one on the rooCase stylus.  That shows how far we have progressed in our technology.  Now with that thought put to rest I won't even get into the area of using voice commands with a tablet.", "I've had it for a few days now, and I am very pleased.  Although it's not as precise as an old fashioned stylus (those pointy plastic toothpick things), it's about as good as you're going to get to work with the iPad/iPhone.PRO's:-has earphone plug to allow you to keep the stylus around when not in use-pen has good length to allow you to rest your hand near outside of screen and write-weight is balanced properly for a natural feel-responsive on screen (although due to the way the iPad screen is designed, you do have to use minor pressure.  lightly brushing the screen won't do the trick)CON's:-when plugged into headphone jack, iPad acts as if you have headphones in.  So it won't play sound over speakers.  But still its about the only place to be able to store the stylus on the iPad besides maybe data jack.-it would be nice to have a tip that was about as narrow as a pen, but that's just not possible on the iPad.Overall, very pleased.  As long as its durability hold up to the test of time, I would say you can't beat it.", "\"This does what it claims to do, but after trying it on an Asus Transformer and the Acer W500 I'm pretty dissapointed.  I am probably spoiled since I own a TabletPC with a digitizer and Wacon stylus, but using this stylus with its relatively thick tip is not at all like using a pen, it is pretty much the same as using your finger.  I guess this can keep your screen free of smudges and could be handy in really cold weather when you are wearing gloves, but it is nothing like using a stylus with a digitizer screen which is much more like using a pen. I guess Steve Jobs has never used a good non-capacitance stylus when he claimed that using a stylus was a \"\"fail\"\". The good thing is that it costs so little that you haven't lost much.\"", "I've tried a few stylus units for my ipad and this one has something the other's did not: a firmer tip. This makes a big difference when creating sketches within art programs. The previous stylus pens worked nice but had a mushy feel. I always felt I needed to press too hard to get any screen reaction. This stylus tip has a nice feel and glides across the screen smoothly.Nice stylus at a nice price.", "One of those things you need on occasion.  Most of the time, your finger will work, but when you need to be precise, one of these does the job well.", "This little stylus makes using the Kindle Fire so much easier.  It can be clipped right to my rooCase Kindle Fire Cover so I don't lose it.  Much better than using my fingers on the Kindle Fire screen as my fingers are large and the stylus provides more pin-point activation without damaging the screen.  I recommend it.", "\"I don't know if the first stylus I tried was a capacitive stylus or not, but this rooCase stylus is 100% better than the other. (Sorry I can't even remember the name of the one I tossed in the trash, ($1 at one of those dollar stores, it was so bad).This rooCase stylus is well made, glides easily across the screen of my PC tablet, and is more precise than using your fingers to type on the keyboard, too.  It's a little shorter than I thought it would be, slightly over 4\"\" tall, about the same diameter as a writing pen.  I could do without the peg that inserts into the audio jack as I'd rather just use the clip to attach it to the folio I store the tablet in. I highly recommend this.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.000932859955355525, 0.05465561896562576, 0.0024209623225033283, 0.07895807921886444, 0.08192668110132217, 0.10951384156942368, 0.05241835117340088, 4.626294321496971e-05, 0.08032606542110443, 0.00464633060619235, 0.08731836080551147, 0.06133722513914108, 0.06081535294651985, 0.06278932094573975, 0.05995932221412659, 0.005223101936280727, 0.035808905959129333, 0.07533618062734604, 0.06208783760666847, 0.023479314520955086]]}
