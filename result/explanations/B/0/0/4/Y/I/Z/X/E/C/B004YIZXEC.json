I had a Bluetooth keyboard for my Blackberry, since damaged, and that had good responsiveness (it fell short because the folding mechanism would never lock into place).The iHome keyboard came to me just as I contemplated getting a new keyboard for my company iPhone.  However, it falls short in several areas:-non-replaceable battery (apparently).  Ridiculous in this day and age-cheap feel-attracts dirt and lint too easily.For the money, they should have produced a better item.", "This wireless keyboard adequately fills one of the design drawbacks of the iPad (absence of a physical keyboard).  Though it's a pretty small profile keyboard, it's considerably better than the screen key input and laptop users will be totally at home with using this keyboard.  Also works with computers!", "The iHome Bluetooth Keyboard is not a bad keyboard...it's just small.  Really small.  I am a petite Asian woman with small hands, and the iHome Keyboard is okay for me - the keys are spaced a little closer than I'd like, but not so much that I had problems typing with it.  My husband, on the other hand, has larger hands and found it very difficult to type without accidentally pushing another key.  He initially didn't think he would have problems, as he regularly uses an Apple keyboard and a slightly smaller Logitech Bluetooth keyboard regularly, however the iHome is even smaller than both of the keyboards (see photos posted of the size difference between the keyboards above).Another problem I found with the iHome is that the batteries are rechargeable only.  My iPad and iPhone don't have USB ports, so it's a pain when I need to charge my iPad/iPhone and discover that my keyboard needs charging too.  The carrying case isn't all too great - it's a cheap faux velvet bag that doesn't offer much protection to the keyboard when traveling.  If I had to choose between the iHome and something else, I would go with something like theLogitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad (Keyboard-and-Stand Combo) (920-003241).  Not only is the keyboard just slightly smaller than the Apple keyboard, but it also has an on/off switch, runs on AA batteries (and has a great battery life), and comes with a solid carrying case that doubles as a stand.All in all, the iHome isn't bad...it serves its purpose of being a small lightweight travel keyboard and it holds a charge well enough.  However, there are a lot of better options out there - I would shop around.  Not recommended.", "\"Until I used the iHome Bluetooth keyboard, it was a pain to type on my iPad. I avoided writing reviews on it because I had to spend so much time making corrections or the spell checker mangled my words. Total frustration! Even emails were difficult and I sent some embarassing ones because I didn't catch errors.The iHome Bluetooth has changed all that. In fact, I'm writing this review while using it and moving along at my usual - pre iPad - speed. What a relief! I do want to clarify the fact that I am NOT comparing this to any other keyboards because this is the first one I've used with my iPad. In short, this is a comparison between the iPad keyboard on the screen (too small) and the iHome.I've noticed not all reviews are positive but I haven't had any problems and setup was easy, even for someone like me - not always able to follow complicated or numerous tech setup directions.  It took less than 3 minutes. As I assumed, the battery was included so I simply turned on the power toggle, let the Power/Bluetooth indicator light up for 5 seconds and then go off -as expected.From there, it was a simple matter of pressing the Connect button, as instructed, and hitting the Settings icon on my iPad. The iPad easily \"\"discovered\"\" the keyboard and I was ready to go.I do have to check my own spelling as I haven't found an automatic spell check yet and am not sure if there is one. But this is no big deal compared to typing so slowly before and the spell checker included with the iPad actually made things worse and I had more spelling errors than now.This is also noted to work on some Iphones as well as the Ipod touch but I haven't tested those capabilities. Operating distance is noted to be up to 10 meters but I use mine in a dedicated office space most of the time and it also works fine throughout our wireless network, anywhere in our home as well as any wireless network we can access elsewhere.Because I can forget to turn off devices, I'm happy that the keyboard automatically goes into sleep mode after 15 minutes. I've noticed that some have complained about the keyboard being \"\"flimsy\"\" but I  find it lightweight and convenient.As a new user, time will tell how well this holds up but I like what I'm experiencing so far. A nice bonus is the travel pouch which helps to protect the keyboard from dirt and dust and the USB cable is easy to keep in place, ready to plug into our wall outlet adapter.Such a pleasure to have an option to that tiny iPad keyboard! Okay, review done in record speed compared to the iPad. Whew!\"", "\"For background, I own and use a variety of bluetooth keyboards; with my main one being theApple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION]. I also have one from Belkin and Targus as well (bundled with iPad cases)[Good]Inexpensive: It's really hard to beat this keyboard's price. By comparison, Apple's wireless keyboard costs approx 3 times as much as iHome's model. Most competing models cost almost twice as much, or even more depending on whether they come bundled with an iPad case.Versatile: It's just a bluetooth keyboard. Technically you can use this with any computing machine that supports bluetooth, such as a lot of Desktop PCs, laptop PCs, MacBooks, iMacs, and even Android devices.The product has a good weight to it. It feels solid; the key word is \"\"feels\"\". This does not mean that it actually is solid and strong.[Bad]Cheap: It's cheap for a reason. It's all plastic and it doesn't look nice. It's cheap, looks cheap, and feels cheap. I wouldn't complain about this if it wasn't marketed as a keyboard for iPad. Anything Apple related should try to aspire to Apple standards of quality. This just isn't one of those products.Batteries: You can't replace them easily, without breaking it apart. It's designed to be charged by USB. I guess if the batteries went bad, you will either ticker with opening the keyboard or just give it to someone who can. It's good to keep in mind, since this is probably why this is smaller and lighter than the Apple keyboard though.iPad Case Integration: There's isn't any iPad case integration to my knowledge, which somewhat kills the point of this product being marketed for iPad. Compare this to competing products from Targus, Belkin, and even Apple's own keyboard. It's just not as convenient to carry this around. I'm really not sure why they marketed this for iPads when they don't seem to cater much to how iPads are used.[Misc]Size: Though it's smaller and lighter than an Apple wireless keyboard, there are other bluetooth keyboards that are both smaller and lighter. It's not really great or bad.Battery Capacity: Nothing to really write about. It's comparable to other bluetooth keyboard products.[Verdict]If you know what this product is and what it isn't and if you don't travel with it or move it around much, then I think it's good enough for everyday home use as long as you know its limits on durability and you don't mind using something that doesn't really match the quality of your Apple product. I think it will work fine and last long enough if you just keep it stationary on a desk.\"", "\"This iHome Bluetooth Keyboard arrives already charged, which makes it a snap to set up.  To use with an iPad, you just (1) switch the keyboard on, (2) press the \"\"connect\"\" button, (3) use iPad Settings/General/Bluetooth to find the keyboard, (4) click on the name of the found keyboard, and (5) enter the code that pops up.  (The keyboard requires iOS 4.0 or later to connect to an iPhone 3G or iPod Touch.)The featherweight keyboard is quite reasonably priced.  It's a little smaller than the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook (3.5\"\" rather than 4\"\" high, 9.5\"\" rather than 10\"\" wide).  Because I have large hands, my fingers are somewhat scrunched up, but I was able to adapt quickly.  The keys are flat-topped, rather than contoured.  There are the usual \"\"hot keys\"\" that wake the iPad, go to the Home screen, adjust the volume, do fast forward/back, go to the Search screen, etc.  The keyboard goes into sleep mode automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity.  A USB charger cable is included, so that the keyboard can be recharged by plugging it in to a computer (or into an AC outlet if you have an adaptor).This keyboard does not attach to the iPad, a case, or anything else.  I like having a free-standing keyboard, because I can place it anywhere that's comfortable for typing, well away from the iPad itself.  The keyboard is molded so that it is angled slightly upwards when placed on a flat surface, and it has nice rubberized grippers that keep it from sliding around on my desktop.  A black, velvety-textured, drawstring carrying bag is included to protect the keyboard in transit or in storage.Quality control could be a problem with this keyboard.  Mine had a loose area at the lower right corner, which made the keys in that corner rattle.  However the fix was easy:  pressing down firmly between the keys settled the corner under the clip that was there to hold it in place.  I like this keyboard a lot, and will be using it regularly with my iPad.  I rate it at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because of the quality control issue.\"", "This keyboard's most important feature is its compact size.  It's only as wide as the iPad is in landscape, which means small keys and keys that are shifted from their normal position.  It does annoy me that a lot of these smaller keyboards make the right shift key small and move it out of position, instead of making the arrow keys smaller and keeping the shift full sized.  The shift key is much more important, so why not move the arrow keys around?It's very light and made of plastic.  It's a solid type of plastic though and doesn't feel too fragile to me.  I really like the feel of the keys, which are solid and springy.  With cheap keyboards, I've noticed the keys tend to be made of a flimsier plastic and have a soft feel to them when you press them.  Pairing was fast and reliable.  I haven't had any missed key presses yet, just a lot of typos because of the smaller keys.  I'm not deducting any points for the size of the keyboard though.  Its impossible to make a keyboard this size without that problem.  If you want something full sized, this is not for you.  If you need something light that can fit into a smaller space, you might be happy with this.", "I will admit, I am probably unfairly reviewing this. I currently have an Apple wireless keyboard for my iPad and I prefer it by far! But I might be a bit unfair because it arrived slightly damaged; though it works, the half the keyboard is detached from the case. This makes for a more unstable area for typing. Perhaps because if this I had a hard time correctly typing words. Or it might be because the keys are rather small and spaced very close together. Or maybe I'm just more accustomed to my Apple keyboard and if I spent a week on the iHome version I'd get more accustomed to it.The positive features: It comes with a little carry bag, which is a nice feature.It's not too expensive.It synched effortlessly with my iPad. Super easy to use.it's compact.The negatives:It does feel rather cheap and, like I noted, it was already falling apart before I opened the box.The keys are really small and spaced together.All in all, it's usable and I'm sure one would get used to the keys being so small and have very little issues with it. It is about 30 dollars cheaper than the Apple Wireless Keyboard, so if you are looking for an inexpensive keyboard this would be adequate. However, I really do prefer my Apple one. It feels very similar to a Macbook Pro keyboard and is a very stylish, sleek and beautiful design.", "This little keyboard is great for certain purposes. For those looking for a keyboard for daily use, I suggest the Apple Wireless Keyboard; spend the extra twenty-five bucks and get the best. However, for traveling with an iPad or similar tablet, this lightweight iHome keyboard is hard to beat. For me, it paired easily and quickly with my iPad, and is more than adequate for my purposes--that is, when I want to deal with lots of emails or making notes at a Panera or Starbucks when I'm on the road. It slips easily into my bag and does everything it needs to do.
