"], "reviews": ["\"Pura d'or Argan Oil is the best oil I have ever tried. I have exceedingly sensitive and dry skin, and other oils I have tried are either irritating, or just too thick to use and clog my pores. Pura d'or Argan Oil smoothes on evenly and soaks into my skin, leaving it soft and pliable, with absolutely no bad side effects like blotchy skin or itching. It is fabulous alone, and absolutely perfect under the light foundation I use. It helps the cosmetic cover the blemishes and also seems to make it last longer. Hours later, my skin still looks \"\"fresh.\"\"I also tried it on my hair, simply by taking what little remained on the palm of my hands and scrunching up my curls with them. It brought a luster and bounce to them that made them look like very happy curls. So I'm pleased with the Pura d'or hair results. I also put some on my legs, which were looking rather dry....and the dryness left and has not returned. This oil is Morocco's gift to the world, and Pura d'or is the brand to buy. Organic, 100% pure, and sold in a dark brown bottle (never buy this oil in clear bottles). The aroma is also fresh...and not strong...it's an indescribable aroma, quite unlike anything, but very pleasant.I like that it comes in a pump bottle. Just make sure you pump into your palm, and not onto a finger! It has a small aperture, but it comes out of the spout in a hurry, and will go beyond your finger...and you don't want to waste a single drop of this precious oil! Thank you Pura d'or for this great product. I have searched long for a good oil, and this Argan Oil really is like finding pure gold.\"", "After using this for several days, I must admit that I am VERY pleased with this. It has a nutty kind of smell, and a tiny bit goes a VERY long way.When I was originally contacted by Pura D'or, I asked a lot of questions before I agreed to test this for review. I am not a huge fan of anything that is environmentally a problem, or that manipulates and uses people. It was only after checking this out that I agreed to try a sample and give my own honest opinion about it.First, I discovered that Argan Oil comes from nuts grown from the Argan tree in Morocco. The tree is endangered, but rather than diminishing the trees, the sale of the oil has promoted growth of additional trees, and Morocco has set aside preserves to protect this national treasure.Second, I discovered that some of the processing of this oil must be done manually. Morocco has established women's cooperatives to process the oil, who are paid directly. As a result, the processing of the oil has benefited women and the economy.Since I could stand behind it (if it worked), I allowed Pura d'or to send me a complimentary sample for my personal use and testing.Meeting my personal standards doesn't matter, if it doesn't work. After reading through the reviews, I did try it. I placed two drops on my hand, and rubbed it in, then gently placed it around my eyes, massaging it in. Unlike some creams, this oil didn't strictly disappear, rather it stayed to work its wonders. It felt moistened rather than oily.I have purchased expensive creams before, and after a short period of time they don't seem to be effective. In this case, even several hours later my eye area still felt soft and moist. I don't have a lot of lines, but the ones I had appeared smaller, even from the start. After several days, my eyes look younger. I have also used this on my legs for winter dry skin, and while it took more, it did effectively moisten my legs as well.Since Argan oil is also used as a cooking oil (food grade), I also took a brief taste of this. There was the tiniest nut taste. This isn't food grade, so I don't recommend cooking with it, but we reviewers are notoriously curious (and picky) about any products that end up in our hands, particularly if we are asked to consider them for review.I am continuing to explore ways to use this oil, besides the all-important eyes, and my legs, and as far as I am concerned, this is the oil that has helped my wrinkles better than any other.", "Pura D'or Pure Organic Argan Oil is a thin oil that is absorbed by my skin extremely well. My legs get dry and scaly in the winter. After treating them with this oil after each bath I noticed that they look and feel better. My skin soaks up the oil so well that the hand applying the oil does not feel unpleasantly oily. The bottle has a mist applicator, which worked well. After two pumps, I use my hand to massage the oil into the skin. Once the oil is applied I can see the skin glistening yet it does not feel oily.My second application of the oil is my hair. I recently began coloring a white streak in my hair, when I applied oil to my scalp and the colored hair it felt softer and more pleasant to touch.The Argan Oil is unscented. I do not detect any scent sniffing the bottle, or when I spread the oil on my skin. I prefer unscented products, so I was very pleased with this aspect of the Argan Oil as well.Pura D'or Oil comes in a glass bottle that can become slippery if you get oil on it. To avoid it from falling and breaking I have a piece of paper towel on hand to wipe it after use.I received an evaluation sample from the manufacture to share my experience with potential buyers. I found the oil to be effective, with long lasting results, and nice to use. I have been using it for a few weeks and I will continue to use it. I recommend it to others.Ali Julia review", "\"I, along with everyone else I imagine, hear all kinds of stuff about \"\"miracle products\"\". Those that do everything, it seems, except your laundry and your dishes. Then a new one comes along, and the other one is mostly forgotten about. However, argan oil has been news for long enough that I was finally beginning to get curious about its supposed benefits. So when I was offered some to try, I accepted.I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. There are very, very few products that I can use on my face that won't end up causing some sort of reaction. The rest of my body, while not as sensitive, is still very dry. I tried the Pura D'or Argan Oil on my body first, and loved how easily it absorbed without feeling greasy. It has a very light, almost nonexistent, smell - nice, because I'm not too fond of products that smell like they were created in a cheap perfume factory.As for my face - I hesitantly applied a small bit to one section of my face and waited for the redness and burning to commence. When, after 30 minutes, there were no signs of either, I applied it the rest of my face before I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning, my face felt soft and supple, and there were no signs of any dry skin patches. I have used this product on my face since then, and am so pleased! I love not having to use the overly processed facial creams in order to keep my skin from freaking out on me!I have not tried most of the myriad other ways that argan oil can be used, but the fact that my skin is doing so well with it is all I really need. I heartily recommend this to anyone who has skin issues similar to mine - I think you will be just as pleased as I have been.NOTE: I was offered a bottle of this product to test by the company in exchange for a review. However, I accepted with the caveat that I take great pride in writing honest reviews, regardless of where the product comes from.\"", "Disclaimer: Pura D'or sent me a bottle for review purposes.I've heard a lot about argan oil as a multipurpose cosmetic treatment, but I felt like I could quite figure out how to get the most out of this product.For hair:I tried putting it in dry hair - but it made my hair look oily. I tried putting it in damp hair, same effect. I tried using less... and I got oily patches (couldn't distribute it evenly).I tried putting it in my hair at night and washing it out in the morning; I don't think this had any effect. Maybe it would make my hair stronger with repeated use though.For skin:I tried it on my face, but my skin was feeling oily already at the time and I had some zits, so putting even more oil on it didn't feel very good.I tried it on dry skin patches (like the rough skin on my elbows)... and this was pretty great. Softened the dry skin right up.Seemed good as well as a general skin moisturizer (instead of body lotion).So I'm not sold. It seems okay but not really better than my normal hair/skin products.However, if you already like using argan oil, this brand seems good quality and the bottle is a big so a good value for the price.", "I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review. I have to say I think this is one of the best beauty products on the market. I love that it's organic with a mild anti-bacterial factor. I've been using it on my hands and face and can tell a huge difference with my hands, which during the winter are normally dry and my fingernails cracked and peeling. Since I've been using Pura D'or on my hands, my nails look healthy and are growing and my hands aren't as dry and look and feel better. My face is smoother and lines are not as noticeable. I haven't used it on my hair yet but intend to. The oil sprays on and is easy to apply, and doesn't feel oily after it's absorbed into the skin. Very well worth the cost.This is one product I intend to purchase from here on out.", "Argan oil seems to be all the latest rage. It's popping up in all kinds of products, especially hair products.This product is just organic pure Argan oil imported from Morocco. No need to order some product that has just enough Argan oil in it so they can claim it and put the words on the label when you can just order pure Argan oil yourself.It's so moisturizing that I've been using it on my hair, body and my face. Love a little more moisture than typical products can provide, especially during the dry winter season. It is a little oily like you would expect and I can't really detect a scent although I'm not sure that I would just say it's unscented but it doesn't have fragrance added, just the pure oil.~ I received a free product to review.", "As a newcomer to argan oil, I was surprised by how versatile it is.  You can apply it to any part of your body, from hair to heels.  My skin absorbs it quickly, no matter where I put it, and because of this, it doesn't leave an oily sheen, just a silky softness.  The only application that I did not like was in my hair -- more on that later.I have extremely delicate and sensitive skin on my face, and I had no negative reactions to the oil, even when I applied it under my eyes.  (I did this only after trying it on the rest of my face for a few days.)  My hands are staying hydrated between applications, even after I wash my hands a lot during the day and use alcohol-based germ killer.  Often in the winter I have to use a thick cream on my hands at night, and by the next night, my hands are crying out for more.  If I skip a day of argan, my hands don't seem to mind.  The oil is supposed to be good for nail strengthening and cuticle softening.  While it softened my cuticles, I can't say what effect, if any, it is having on my nails since they are generally strong.I researched argan oil online so that I would know one should look for when purchasing it.  This brand fits all the criteria:  glass bottle, dark container, cold-pressed oil, 100% argan.  I also discovered from the research that argan oil is perishable (hence the need for a dark bottle), so if you don't use it up within six months or so, you should buy a new bottle. The Pura D'Or Argan Oil uses a pump to dispense the oil, and that can be a little messy.  I also wonder how well it will work when the oil gets near the bottom.  The drips down the side of the bottle from using the pump got a half-star deduction from me.I also did a comparison between argan oil and the much cheaper castor oil, which is often used for the same purposes.  Castor oil was much stickier and more difficult to spread.  It also was not absorbed as quickly, which meant that the oily sheen lasted longer.  The argan oil simply feels more silky, and I felt confident that I was spreading a thin layer everywhere.Now about using it on hair . . . . it was not a good thing for me.  I used a small amount, about as much as I would on my face, and massaged it into my wet hair before styling.  Ick.  Even after combing it through, I could see it and feel it in my dried hair.  The argan oil did not get absorbed as quickly as it did on my skin.  Because I'm blonde, the argan oil darkened the areas where it stuck.  This might be great to use on dark and/or damaged hair, but it had only negative effects on mine.  I won't waste this expensive oil on my head again.  This didn't make me love the argan oil any less, but it did teach me where it worked best on my body.Argan oil has been a revelation for me.  I like that a natural, organic oil can actually work better than many preserved, perfumed, chemically-created products. Note:  The manufacturer supplied a sample for review.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "I was introduced to Argan oil recently and was provided with a sample of Pura D'Or Pure and Organic Argan Oil.  After researching it and discovering it's various cosmetic uses, I have finally settled to using it on my scalp and hair.Argan comes from Morocco and this particular cold-pressed Argan oil is pure, has very little scent (if any) and provides a wonderful booster and sheen to hair ... and nourishment to the scalp (especially if it is dry).  I have used this oil on my skin (and I use Virgin Coconut oil as well) and my scalp and hair.  It is oil, so it has the feel of oil without a lot of the heaviness.  Massaged into the roots, it provides vitality and sheen.As I experiment with this product further, I will discover more uses I am sure.  The Pura D'or brand is packaged in it's own cloth bag and created in an environmentally responsible way.  Pura uses the dark glass bottle to limit exposure to light and keeps it simple.I look forward to enjoying the continued benefits of this oil and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great, healthy sheen to their hair.", "I am VERY impressed with this product for two reasons. First, I have battled poor skin my entire life, so I was a little wary about putting it on my face. I was afraid it would just exacerbate the problem. My skin does get a little dry from using acne products, so I thought this might be something that could add a little balance back to my skin. It does just that! And surprisingly, it absorbs into the skin very quickly and does not leave it feeling greasy.Second, you can skip all those hundred dollar wrinkle creams and just use this! I don't have a lot of wrinkles or anything, but I do have fine lines around my eyes and, NO LIE, just minutes after applying this to my face, I noticed those lines plump up and become much less obvious. I was stunned, as I was not expecting that! I have also tried rubbing it into the heels of my feet and it does wonders there as well. I pretty much live barefoot whenever possible and my heels get dry and scaly (esp. in the winter) as a result. I put the Pura D'or on overnight and there is a noticeable difference in the morning.Lastly, this product is organic, and that is very important to me. For what it does, the cost of this product is more than fair! Youth in a bottle (as much as that is actually possible).I have rather fine hair, so I would never consider applying it to my hair, but I have no doubt that those with thick and or dry hair would love the shine this product would produce (I have used Argan oil shampoos and love it for shine). It is also wonderful for shining up dry fingernails.It is odorless, cool and soothing, and again, does not leave a greasy residue, as it absorbs readily into the skin.I love, love, love this product and will attest that it is worth every last penny being charged for it.As a side note, this is a 4 oz. bottle and one need only use a pea sized amount when applying it to the face. There is no reason why this product can't last between six months and a year.", "I love this product.  It's probably my favorite beauty product these days.  I have very sensitive skin and almost anything turns my face red and irritated.  I have tried other Argan oil products and they've always had a musky or funny smell which irritated my system and gave me a headache.  This product is pure, clean and has no smell at all.  I put two pumps of oil in my hands and then smooth it over my (clean) face before bed.  In the morning my skin is soft, with no dry patches, and no red splotches.  Truly one of the best products I have ever used.", "\"I received this for review three weeks ago and have applied it twice a day since then. I was nervous about trying it because I have acne-prone skin, and it seems counter-intuitive to put oil on it. I wrote to the manufacturer to make sure-- \"\"is it REALLY okay for acne-prone skin?\"\" They assured me it was, so I figured it was worth a shot.Within just a few days, my skin looked much smoother. Like the pores were smaller or something-- I'm not savvy enough to identify exactly what it is, but it just looked better overall. Still had my usual blemishes, though.Within a week, many of my acne scars/marks had faded.The next week, the acne got slightly worse, and I thought, \"\"See??\"\"But the following week it went away entirely except one pimple. That pimple is now gone. My face is clear... for the first time in years.I'm amazed. This really is the best my skin has looked in ages! I'm one of those weirdoes who got acne later in life-- around age 30-- and I've been fighting it ever since. Right now, my routine is just to wash my face with Cetaphil foaming cleanser in the morning and put on this oil (just a small amount, and rub it in-- it sinks in nicely in just a minute or so and doesn't look shiny). At night I use astringent and toner, then the oil again. Voila. I normally also do a chemical peel once every week or two, but I haven't needed to do it in these past two weeks because my skin is so clear.I'm a believer. Great stuff, and I feel so good about the fact that it's organic.\"", "I was surprised when I received this product that so versatile. According to the packaging, it's good for hair, face, and skin. I was a skeptic, so I started using it in my hair just to see if I could tell a difference. I was surprised to find that I really have seen a difference in that my hair is shinier. I will say, though, that you have to be careful not to use TOO much or your hair will be heavier and oily - but that is only due to user error, at least on my part. :)Overall, I was actually pretty impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to improve hair shininess and skin tone.I also must disclose, as a reviewer, that I received this shirt from the company in exchange for an unbiased review.", "Pura D' or Pure & Organic Argan Oil is a USDA certified organic product with feel good properties. Packaged in a dark bottle to help preserve freshness, the product also includes a small, drawstring bag for storage.Argan oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, amino acids and other good for you ingredients. It is a multi-purpose fluid that can be used to revitalize the skin, reverse hair damage and more.One of my favorite uses is on my finger and toe nails. Just a little of this potent oil goes a long way to give moisture to nails. This results in less breakage allowing for stronger growth.I also found it very healing to dry, rough patches on my skin. The liquid inside smooths on easily and is soaked up by the skin with no greasy residue. A little goes a long way so the 4oz size will last a long time.Overall this is a top notch, multi-purpose beauty oil and I love that it is chemical free!", "Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil is very high quality, organic, cold-pressed oil from the kernel from the seed of the fruit of the argan tree. It is almost colorless, with a faint, slightly sweet and natural scent, definitely nutty but unique, with just a hint of earthy spiciness similar to nutmeg or mace. It comes in an amber glass bottle with a pump that neatly dispenses a large drop.I suffer from mild psoriasis (an overproduction of skin cells) which causes irritated, scaly patches of flaking skin so I started applying a couple of drops twice a day to the affected areas after bathing. In just a couple of days, I noticed a difference in the appearance and texture, with much less dryness and noticeable flaking. It hasn't cured the psoriasis but it has made my skin look and feel much better with regular use and it has even reduced the itching. My elbows in particular have not looked this healthy in several years. I have also been applying it to my dry, damaged cuticles and it has improved the way they look as well.Also remarkable is that the argan oil doesn't feel at all greasy or oily after massaging it into the skin but simply leaves it smooth and moist. After applying it at night, the skin is still moist in the morning rather than dry. I have used several prescription topical sprays and ointments and many, many different kinds of oils, lotions, and salves but this has been more effective than any of them and it doesn't transfer to bed linens or clothes nor does it have a strong or unpleasant odor. I wish I had known about argan oil before.A sample was provided for unbiased testing and review.Thank you for reading my review of Pura D'or Organic Argan Oil!", "I live in the southern California desert and dry skin and hair are problems I'm always fighting.  So far, I'm very pleased with this oil.  It's a little heavy to leave on my hair - I put it on at night and wash it out in the morning, but it is lighter than the oils I've been using on my face.  It may be my imagination, but my skin seems to have lightened some.  It has a light sent, I use very little to cover my entire face.I have a problem with rough heels and I've put some Pura d' Or Argan Oil on for several nights and the skin is definitely softening.  I would recommend this product to friends without hesitation.", "I have tried so many different Argan oils since it became popular and some made me wonder what the heck was really in the bottle, they didn't work well or were to greasy or smelled funny.  I was skeptical to try yet another claim of Argan oil but this one said it was pure and organic so I gave it a try.I live in the North where it is cold and we use a wood stove, and my skin and hair gets VERY dry and I sometimes have flaky and itchy skin.  I have tried every lotion out there for this condition and nothing worked, the only thing that comes close to moisturizing my dry skin in the winter is oil after a shower.I tried this Pura D'or pure argan oil this morning.  I put a bunch into my clean dry hair and then covered it in a warm towel for about 30 minutes.  I made sure to mostly get the ends and massage it into my scalp and then combed it through with a wide tooth comb.  Then I took off the towel and jumped in the shower, I washed my hair with shampoo once, and then put more oil on the ends of my hair and at the nape of my neck where it gets really dry, and then I put my regular conditioner on the ends and left that on for about 6 minutes.  I rinsed and when I dried my hair it was soft, and no tangles, I lost much less hair down the drain as well.I also used the oil on my body when I got out of the shower, I would use 3 pumps of oil in one hand and a pump of my moisturizing lotion and mix it together and put it on.  If you have dry skin you MUST try this.  My skin is not dry at all, is not tight or itchy and is very soft to the touch. I would highly recommend this Argan oil over all others that I have tried.I am going to add a few drops of this oil to my conditioner bottle and my body and hand lotion bottles, this way each time I wash my hands or put on lotion I will be getting some of the benefits of this oil.  I am extremely happy with this product.", "I'm prone to really dry skin which gets even more difficult to manage in the winter time. The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I've tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.The bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I'm hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.The instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn't what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn't washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.", "\"This USDA Certified Organic Argan Oil 100% Pure Moroccon Argan oil feels soothing on my skin. I've recently lost 21 pounds and I was worried that the skin my face would show signs of the missing \"\"cushioning\"\". I started using this oil early on into the weight loss and I'm happy to report that my skin actually looks better than it did before I lost the weight. Some of that may be because I'm eating better, but even some of the deeper wrinkles around my mouth and chin look better. My skin is normally dry and it feels so good after applying this oil. I find that a lot of it is absorbed right away, and the rest within about half an hour. I apply it about an hour before I go to bed and when I first get up in the morning, after I wash my face. That's usually sufficient although I sometimes apply a little more if I've been out in the cold or wind during the day, just because it feels so good on my skin.I love that this product is fragrance free and that it's organic and pure. I apply it fairly close to my eyes (where there are tiny wrinkles) and products with fragrance can irritate my eyes. This doesn't have that effect at all. I still have another 12 pounds to lose and I'm counting on this Pura D'or Argan Oil to keep preventing those wrinkles that can sometimes result from looser skin due to weight loss. I've started applying it to my stomach and thighs this last week. Although the product seems pricey, it takes just a couple drops and the little button on the top dispenses just the right amount, so this bottle will probably last over a year. With all the use over the past several weeks, I've barely made a dent in it.I received this product for review from Pura D'or.\"", "Normally when I buy Argan Oil I find it has a lot of extra chemicals. What I like about this Pura D'or oil is that it is absolutely pure and organic. You can really use it all over your body.I especially like using this oil as a massage oil. It is very slick and absorbs well but makes massage very pleasant. Usually with other oils I have to use a lot more and the skin remains oily.Another thing I noticed about this oil was that using it actually made my face less oily. I'd recommend using this at night. When you wake up the next day your skin will look radiant.I also put Argan Oil in my hair at night and wash it out the next day. I also add it to conditioners and use it in the shower.This oil has antibacterial properties and is good for many skin conditions. You may want to use this on your nails to help them grow out strong.If you use this on your feet I'd recommend you do so at night before you go to bed. Also great for hands to condition them overnight.You may want two bottles - one to keep in the bedroom for massage and nightly use on hands and feet and one to keep in the bathroom for face and body application.~The Rebecca ReviewI received a free bottle for review. This is no way changes how I review. This review is my honest opinion based on my experience.", "I have dry thick curly hair and Pura D'or's argan oil has been perfect!  It is light and smells great. I have to be careful not to use too much, a little goes along way.  Leave my hair shiny, manageable and controls frizz. It seems to have improved my hair even on days that I don't use it.  I have just recently seen other uses -- for skin, nails, etc... can't wait to try it!", "I've been using this for about a month now and I absolutely love it.  It soaks right into the skin leaving no stickiness or other irritating feel.  I've used it for a few different things:Eczema- I've had eczema off and on for most of my life and this stuff just makes it vanish.Dry Hands- My husband and I get really bad dry winter hands. His get so bad that they feel like sand paper.  This stuff improved both of our hands greatly.  Mine have become very soft and although I can't claim that his are now soft, they are no longer causing him pain or annoyance.Dry Rash- For about 2 months prior to trying this product out I had a really bad itchy, dry rash that ran from my knee to my ankle on one side of my leg.  It was getting so bad I was about to call the doctor.  I'd been using Hydrocortisone cream as well as other lotions and had no improvement.  After using this product once I noticed a huge improvement.  After using it a 2nd time the rash disappeared completely.  I couldn't believe it.This oil has a wide variety of uses and I would highly recommend it.", "Argan oil, like other naturally derived oils, such as coconut, marula, and borage-seed, can be an effective moisturizer when used alone or in conjunction with other products. Pura D'or Organic Argan Oil is particularly refined, scentless and golden colored. Especially appreciated is the pump top bottle which allows just the correct amount to be supplied at a time. A single pump is enough to cover the face, smooth over one's hair or massage on to the cuticles. I found this oil to be excellent when applied on my face prior to applying Retin-A products.
