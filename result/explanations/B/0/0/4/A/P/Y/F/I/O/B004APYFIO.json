"], "reviews": ["The idea of this snack package that is a healthier alternative to other snacks that is also easy to eat is an excellent idea.  There are a few flaws though.  I find it a little pricey and not all items made healthier tasted good to me.  Let's start with the VEGETABLE CHIPS.  They taste fine as long as you like pepper.  The pepper taste is very strong.  These are gluten free which is great and have no trans fat but there is still 7 grams of fat per serving.  The Cinnabon ALMONDS are tasty but very hard on the teeth.  The coating is very hard to bite.  And the gluten free Annie's BUNNY COOKIES just don't work for me.  There is just no taste to these cookies.What is very succesful for me is the organic GUMMIE FRUIT SNACKS.  Very tasty and soft, easy to chew.  Also the GO PICNIC ready meal is very succesful with the tasty turkey stick and barbecue chips.  The chocolate is also very tasty.  This box set is definitely worth a shot.  Healthier eating choices are always worth investigating.  Bottom line is are they tasty as well as healthy.  This was a mixed bag for me but nothing was terrible so I do recommend giving it a shot.  You may just love it.", "What a great idea, a gluten-free picnic basket.  It's perfect to send to a kid in summer camp or bring along on a long trainride.All the items may be gluten free but they are full of flavor.  The Tasty Brand Fruit Snacks are bites of gummy goodness; the  Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava Chips pack a peppery punch (which might be a bit much for younger kids); the Cinnabon Almonds will satisfy a sweet tooth (a little too sweet for me) and  Annie's Homegrown Cocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies are as cute as they are yummy.  The Picnic includes two more substantial items, a St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad which is bean-y and filling and the GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch Meal  which rivals any stick of jerky.Total yum", "This little care package is a pretty fun thing for those of us who like to try new foods and lean a little to the healthier snacks.  I don't have a gluten allergy, nor does the hubby, but I can imagine it would be nice to have a whole package of treats you didn't have to worry had gluten in it.  This would be a nice treat for sending away to someone away from home (I'm thinking college, armed services, etc) or for someone that just likes trying new foods.  Here's what I thought:Gummy fruit snacks-favorite in the box and I don't usually like gummies too much because they are sticky and get stuck in your teeth.  These were delicious, made with fruit juice, not sticky and were a nice alternative to more higher caloric candy choices.  I would buy these on my own-delicious!Cassava Chips-I have never tried these before and the chips were yummy, much like a potato chip with less fat and a nice salt/pepper seasoning.  I would also purchase this item on my own.Cinnabon Almonds-delicious but fattening, as nuts can be.  Coated with a sugary-cinnamony coating.  Warning-if you eat this bag, which would not be hard to do, you will have eaten 600 calories or so.  Yikes.  These I wouldn't buy but there are good if you can portion control and use them as an occasional treat.Gopicnic lunch pack for 1-I could make a meal of this but for most people this amount of food would be not enough.  You get a turkey stick (think like a little slim jim), BBQ popchips, Dried Apricots, fruit & nut mix and a square of organic chocolate.  I liked everything but a tiny turkey stick was kind of disappointing. I would think though this would be good to keep at work for an emergency or in a backpack.Cocoa & Vanilla bunny cookies-Love,love, love Annie's bunny cookies!  These are delicious, though I like the three bunny assortment of chocolate, honey & chocolate chip slightly better that I buy at the store, but these organic treats are a winner in my book.  I keep them in the fridge and love them as a quick snack with milk.Lastly, the item I really didn't think would be so good....the St. Dalfour Salad, it is a tin of beans (lentils, cannellinis, kidney & flageolets), carrots and corn.  It comes with a flavor packet, which I tried but ultimately decided to toss, since it was rather sweet.  I looked at some of the serving suggestions and tried the melted cheese over the top.  Once I had this out and tasted it I was a fan and we served this up with blue corn chips (not included) and had a healthy nacho.  I'm sure you would find lots of things to do with these beans and as a nacho they were delicious and filling.Overall, a really good package of delicious items!", "\"This gluten free snack box was quite popular in my house.  Note for wheat allergy types, some of the items are processed on machinery which processes wheat items.  I enjoyed most of the items, several of the snacks very much in fact.  But a few items were a bit baffling, which knocked my overall rating down a star.  My thoughts on the individual items (5 stars being the best):Tasty Brand Organic Assorted Fruit Snacks (2.75 oz.)- five stars! Very tasty, great ingredients, and a good amount of the fruit gummies too.Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava Chips (3 oz.)- 4 stars.  The texture is a bit strange at first.  But the peppery bite ended up making this a great snack, or lunch bag addition (especially with a sandwich. Good quantity too.Cinnabon Almonds (3 oz.)- 1 star.  In a healthy snack pack, why pick almonds drenched in sugar?  The 4 oz package had 44g of sugars.  Bleh.* Annie's Homegrown Cocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies (6.75 oz.)- five stars.  Very, very popular in my house.  The usual high Annie's taste and quality. A nice full size box too.  Wish they used even more Annie's stuff.* St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad (6.2 oz.)- 1 star.  Some strange \"\"French\"\" 3 bean salad in a can.  Note, also actually made in Taiwan, not France as noted on the front.* GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch ready-to-eat meal. Note, by \"\"meal\"\" they mean \"\"light snack\"\". Or \"\"meal for 3 year old who wasn't that hungry\"\".  It was a good snack though.  Overall 4 stars.  Individual ratings of the pack:Old Wisconsin Turkey Snack Stick; 3 stars.  Meh, it was ok.Barbeque Popchips; 4 stars.  Interesting product and flavor.  Very small quantity.Mariani Dried Apricots; not rated don't like them (so it wouldn't be fair).Sweet Perry Orchards Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix; 4 stars.  Interesting and bold choices on the flavors.  I like it.Terra Nostra Organic Dark Chocolate (3 oz); 4 stars. A small square of dark chocolate. At 60% cacao it was a bit bitter, but I like that.  You may not.Overall, with a few tweaks- namely ditching the terrible 3 bean salad and Cinnabon almonds, and adding another Annie's item and some nice all-natural almonds and this would easily be a five star item.\"", "\"Lots of things in this package either 1) taste like the name brands they compete with or 2) lack taste. The first thing can be considered a good thing, nutritionally speaking but not terrific news for the budget-minded. All in all, the whole package left an odd taste in my mouth as well as my family and friends' mouths.These bunny snacks have too much sugar on them, and it doesn't match the gluten-free taste-free taste. I can't stand eating more than one. My two-going-on-three-year-old disagrees. She also liked the fruit snacks, which I couldn't stand.The bean mix was not bad, but still bland. There is a \"\"gourmet\"\" sauce packet that comes with it, but it doesn't really do anything. It's probably water combined with one seasoning. I liked the almonds, even if they were inconsistent (I felt like there was one bitter one for every few tasty ones). I prefer getting them from the tents at fairs and other outdoor events.The veggie chips have a parsnip taste, and I guess I didn't mind them. But my friend did observe, \"\"fry and salt anything enough and it tastes good.\"\" No one else at the table was exactly thrilled by them (for some reason, my wife really doesn't like the dude on the bag).I only got to eat one BBQ potato chip, and it was pretty good. I didn't get to try the turkey stick, my daughter and wife ate it on another day. I'm told that it tasted no different from any other turkey stick out there.\"", "\"....a care package with processed meat and junk food!Firstly, just because something is organic doesn't mean it's healthy. Let's start with the \"\"Go Picnic Pack.\"\" Included is a tiny bag of BBQ Pop Chips (.4oz), dried apricots, a chocolate square, a fruit & nut mix, and (I hope you're sitting down) a \"\"Turkey Snack Stick.\"\" This is the company's idea of a \"\"Ready to eat meal.\"\" Calling it a \"\"meal\"\" is pretty funny. The mystery meat (turkey snack stick) tastes like a Slim Jim. This is all just glorified junk food with some trail mix to make it seem healthy.The box of bunny cookies is the largest item in this \"\"care package.\"\" They are very tasty and I have no complaints with them.The vegetable chips are a good substitute for your typical potato chips. Lots of flavor and crunch. And \"\"25% less fat than a standard chip.\"\" Wooohoo! Now I can go to town on the gummy bears! (see below)Cinnamon covered Cinnabon almonds are excellent.Tasty Brand Assorted Fruit snacks are cleverly disguised gummy bears. Yes, I'm sure they are quite \"\"organic\"\" and such. But come on...they're still gummy bears, and have little redeeming qualities. Except for being small enough to smuggle them into the movie theater and save yourself a few bucks.I am unable to offer an opinion on the \"\"Gourmet on the go salad.\"\" This can of beans, corn and vegetables was too scary for me to open. It will make an excellent addition to my bomb shelter inventory of canned foods that will likely survive an apocalypse. Barring impending starvation, I can not bring myself to open it. The picture on the can provides no motivation either.The idea that this care package is worth the retail price listed of $29.95 (or even the current Amazon price of $19.99) is questionable at best. I suppose if I were lazy and did not care much about the recipient, it would be fine to send. However, if I'm not mistaken, that's the whole idea behind a \"\"care\"\" package...You'd be much better off going to a Whole Foods, and tossing a few good items into a box for your own \"\"care package.\"\"While the idea of a care package with \"\"healthy\"\" items is good, the execution of this one fails in my opinion. It get two stars for the box of bunny cookies and the fact that most of the other items are edible.\"", "Well, I didn't know what to expect when we recieved this package from the Amazon Vine program....mainly because it was made up of gluten free products and we had not tried any gluten free products before.  WOW! We were very pleasantly surprised.  This package would  make a great gift for anyone, especially someone who couldn't cook for themselves or for college students.  The variety of the products was excellent.  The cinnabon almonds were especially delicious as was the nut & fruit mix. All of it was so good that we immediately had a picnic.  Everything was hassel free & ready to eat and enough for more than one person.  The only product that was not raved about was the Cassava Chips.  They were OK but had a distinctively different taste. Overall, I would highly recommend this picnic package of goodies.", "\"I didn't realize I had not yet posted a review on this product. Trust me on this: once you order it you'll likely respond as I did. I had not had many of these products before and each and everyone of them was absolutely delicious. I was on a national road trip that lasted many months and I wound up looking for these products individually and and buying them. Don't think for a minute that \"\"gluten free\"\" means there is any sacrifice for taste here. the Tasty Brand Organic Assorted Fruit Snacks (were about as good as I have ever had. I had never had Cassava Chips before and was VERY pleasantly surprised how great they are as a potato chip substitute -- in fact, better. The Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava Chips started me as cassava chip fan. The Cinnabon Almonds were as good as a cinnamon bun at a mall. The Annie's Homegrown Cocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies didn't last long: even though I am on a perpetual diet I had one, and inhaled the rest. The St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad proved that you could carry a tasty salad that can be eaten at leisure. T  GoPicnic Turkey Stick, Old Wisconsin Turkey Snack Stick, Barbeque Popchips, Mariani Dried Apricots, Sweet Perry Orchards Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix, and Terra Nostra Organic Dark Chocolate  -- etc. The point is: you may not have tried any of these but individually are GREAT and in a convenient package like this it can be a Godsend. The advertising is correct on this as well: it's ready to eat, you don't need a fridge, don't need a stove, and every item is healthy.  Sometimes I order a product I don't know much about and am disappointed. The GoPicnic Tasty Treats Gluten-Free Care Package, 1.76-Pound Package will introduce you to products you'll order and look for over and over.\"", "Being a Type II Diabetic I'm always on the lookout for new things to try and this immediately caught my attention.  Not sure what to expect, I was surprised the amount of stuff that came in such a light box; it's like a care package from home.  The contents are listed as gluten-free as well as not using High Fructose Corn Syrup, and honestly- they taste good enough that you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference.Go Picnic Ready To Eat Meal- packed inside a small, easy to carry box that even has a Sudoku puzzle on the inside.  Contents include:Slim Jim-style turkey stick- but it's more like Mystery Meat.Pop BBQ Popped Potato Chips- no cholesterol, no fat and very tasty.Ultimate Apricots- not bad, but the sulphur dioxide preservative may give you gas.Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix- habanera almonds, sweet & salty peanuts, mango cranberries... mmm, nice!Terra Nostra Organic Chocolate- ok, but I'm not really a fan of dark chocolate.The rest of the box:Cinnabon Cinnamon Coated Almonds- love almonds, but not with cinnamon.  Meh.Tasty Organic Fruit Gummies- sweet and tangy, you'd never know they were made without HFCS.  Delicious!Joseph Banks Cassava Root Veggie Chips w/ Cracked Pepper- bland, reminds me of plantain chips.Annie's Gluten Free Bunny Cookies (Cocoa & Vanilla)- tiny, bunny-shaped crisp cookies that satisfy a sweet tooth.St. Dalfour Gourmet On The Go (Three Beans w/Sweet Corn)- can looks bigger but has a concave lid, making it actually smaller than it should be- 6.2 oz.  This one was lentils, sweet corn, cannellini beans, kidney beans, flageolet beans and onions and comes with what's supposed to be a fork and a tiny packet of `Gourmet Culinary Sauce'.  Not bad at all and the sauce lent a sweet & sour tang to it.This is good for anyone on a gluten-free or otherwise restricted diet or even if you just want something different to try.  Go Picnic has officially entered my radar, and I can't wait to try out some of their other products.", "\"The \"\"six items\"\" stated in the description  of this gluten-free care package is an understatement, because one of the six is a little pre-prepared lunch with several things in it.  In all, there are several bags of fruits and nuts, two kinds of chips, a little chocolate, a box of cookies, a turkey stick, and a prepared salad.Given the pleasure I got in opening this package I had ordered for myself, I expect that the college student or other far-away hungry person would be thrilled to receive this as a gift.All but the turkey stick are vegan, so I hope that Amazon, sometime soon, can produce a vegan care package.\"", "I was kind of surprised when this arrived at my door, there was so much stuff! I took the GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch Meal on a road trip with me and it was awesome - there was a turkey stick, BBQ PopChips (which I had already tried and really enjoyed), yummy dried apricots, zippy Baja Blend Fruit and nut mix and an indulgent dark chocolate square. Basically an entire meal in a cute little self-contained package. It was nice because it did not need refrigeration. Then there was a bag of fruit snacks (they were okay), a bag of Cinnabon almonds (good), Annie's Homegrown Cocoa and Vanilla Bunnies (yummy), St Dalfour salad (eh) and a bag of my new favorite snack...Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava chips (awesome!!). The cassava chips has a great texture and were seasoned just right, they are more dense than regular potato chips. The Annie's bunnies had the added bonus of being gluten-free, if you look for that in a snack as well. All-in-all this was a great deal!", "I titled this review GIFT package because picnic treats just doesn't do it justice. The St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad- in this package it's the bean salad and it's yummy.  I order them now on the subscribe and save program.  As with all the gopicnic items they have a long shelf life and do not require refrigeration.  This becomes particularly handy for our boating trips. It will be equally convenient for those who camp. The GoPicnic Turkey Stick + Crunch Meal- was a real treat, lots of different things in one box to eat all at one time for lunch or snack on throughout the day. One of the biggest hits around the house were the Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava Chips-  So far I can only find these in bulk purchase other than in this kit.  They are most excellent. Cinnabon Almonds are addicting and with the serving size would be 1/2 the total cost of the package alone if bought separately.  Annie's Homegrown Cocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies- are just that.  The vanilla are really vanilla and the cocoa is rich cocoa. So many times you get cookies that just taste plain...not these!You can not go wrong getting this for yourself or as a gift.", "Pros:I found all of the food delicious.  A few of the items seemed substantial, namely, Annie's cookies, bag of vegetable chips, bean salad, cinnamon nuts and tasty gummies.  Actually, the tasty gummies were awesome! Organic, gluten free, corn syrup free...All those things are important to me, and it was fun to share with friends/family.Cons:Overall amount of food in packages could be improved.  The turkey meat stick was smaller than the size of my pointer finger.  The chocolate was little more the size of a mint chocolate found on a motel pillow.  I would have appreciated less items of greater quantities instead of the let-down of a bag of chips with less than ten pieces.Flavors are wonderful and there's more in it overall than in some things I've tried.  It is a treat, for sure.", "\"I have to start off Dear Reader by saying that this will be an exceptionally long review.  Indeed, there were many things contained in this care package and I feel compelled to go over each one in detail.  You see, this care package came with a multitude of supposedly gluten free products (more on this later).  There were fruit snacks, corn and bean salad, a little snack pack, chips, bunny cookies, and specialty almonds.~~~TASTY BRAND ORGANIC FRUIT SNACKSNo HFCS, Gluten Free, USDA organic, and vegan labels.Ingredients: organic tapioca syrup, organic cane sugar, organic tapioca syrup solids, organic white grape juice concentrates, pectin, citric acid, asorbic acid, color added (black carrot juice concentrate, tumeric, annato), natural flavors, sodium citrate, organic sunflower oil and carnauba wax.I'm a big fan of the gummy type of candies.  To find an organic one was kind of a cool thing for me.  That being said these weren't the best gummies in the world, but they were ok as a snack.  There were 6 different flavors.  The lemon was definitely the best and tasted most like the real thing, while the peach ran a close second.  The tangerine was only so-so and the strawberry tasted nothing like strawberries to me.  The mixed berry was the normal artificial tasting flavor (despite not being artificial, and the tropical actually tasted medicinal to me.  All the flavors were really light though and didn't pack that punch of juice like some gummies have.  They also had a very sticky texture, which was hard to get used to.  Unlike normal gummies, I couldn't demolish the whole bag in one sitting as they were just a little too sweet.~~~CINNABON CINNAMON ALMONDSIngredients: Almonds, Sugar, Cinnamon, Sea SaltThere was a lot of sugar in these almonds, 11 g a serving in fact.  But that's probably why I enjoyed the coating on the almonds so much.  It was extremely delicious.  But unfortunately, what it was covering wasn't near as good.  Maybe it was just the pack I had, but these almonds tasted slightly old and sour, you actually needed the coating to make them palatable.  This product would have been perfect had fresher almonds been used I think.  As far as it being the Cinnabon brand, I don't have much experience with their products so I can't say if this was their specific \"\"brand\"\" flavor.~~~ANNIE'S GLUTEN FREE BUNNY COOKIES: COCOA & VANILLAIngredients:Cane sugar, Rice Flour, Yellow Corn Flour, Palm Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Corn Starch, Soy Flour, Organic Tapioca Starch, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Alkalized Cocoa, Natural Chocolate and Vanilla Flavors, Salt, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin, Xantham Gum.This product states that you can't eat just two.  I'm sorry to argue that yes, I could eat just two, or even one.  I wasn't a big fan of the taste of these mini cookies.  It probably has to do something with the rice flour.  I realize these cookies are meant to be gluten free, but rice flour, to me, is the worst choice for desserts as it has a distinctive taste.  With not being able to east these straight then, there was only one logical choice; they became the crust for a cheesecake.  Which actually did work pretty well with them.These cookies do have some good things going for them though.  There are no additives or preservatives, they are GMO free and made in a peanut and tree nut free facility; although they do contain soy allergens.  They also are gluten free due to the alternate flours used.~~~JOSEPH BANKS CASSAVA ROOT VEGETABLE CHIPS CRACKED PEPPERIngredients: Cassava, Palm Kernal Oil, Natural Flavors (Cane Sugar, Sea Salt, Black Pepper Powder, Chilli Powder, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Yeast Extract, Spices, Natural Vitamin # as an antioxidant).What's great about these chips is that they are mostly popular allergen free.  They are formulated to be gluten and dairy free and there are no nut ingredients either.  They also claim to have 30% less fat than regular potato chips.  So what could be bad about them?  Well the taste for one.  When you bite into one of these chips you get a really great taste with the spices and pepper, but then unfortunately it blends into the aftertaste flavor of the Cassava root, which is decidedly cardboard-like.  I did have trouble stopping eating them because of that initial flavor though.  And overall I'd say I like these chips and would continue to purchase them.~~~GO PICNIC TURKEY STICK & CRUNCHThis was kind of its own meal, and a pretty good one at that.  Like Go Picnic's other offerings it is meant to be travel friendly and healthy at the same time, good for packed lunches.  This particular box set included a turkey stick, apricots, a trail mix blend, chips, and a chocolate square.___Old Wisconsin Turkey Snack StickIngredients: Turkey, Mechanically separated Turkey, Salt, Corn Syrup Solids, Spices, Lactic Acid Starter culture, Dextrose, Carrageenan, Sodium Crythorbate, Garlic powder, Sodium nitrite, in a collagen casing.Not surprisingly this was my favorite out of the box; things with unpronounceable ingredients are always more tastier than they should be.  It was a slightly spicy stick that was very flavorful.  The only problem was, there was only one small stick in this box, not near enough for me!___Mariani ApricotsIngredients: Dried apricots, Natural Flavors, Sulphur dioxide, pottassium sorbate.  Made on the same equipment as milk, soy, and tree nuts.These were pretty standard dried apricots.  If you like apricots, you'll like these.  They were dried well, but still had a nice juicy center to bite into.___Sweet Perry Orchards Baja BlendIngredients: Habanera almonds (almonds, sugar, spices, sea salt), sweet and salty peanuts (peanuts, sugar, salt), mango cranberries (cranberries, sugar, glycerin, citric acid, natural mango flavors, sunflower oil).  Made on equpment with peanuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, walnuts, brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pistachios,milk, wheat and soy.I always like these trail mixes by Sweet Perry Orchards. They are always extremely good.  This one was nice and sweet but had just a hint of heat in it which really pulled all the flavors together.___Pop Chips BBQIngredients: Natural potato ingredients (flakes & starch), safflower or sunflower oil, BBQ seasoning (sugar, whey, onion and garlic powder, salt, torula yeast, brown sugar, tomato powder, yeast extract, spices, natural flavors, natural smoke flavor, citric acid, paprika extract), rice flour, salt.  Milk allergens and made on equipment shared with wheat.These had an interesting texture due to the way they were cooked.  The spices were nice for flavoring, but it had a less than desirable aftertaste.___Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark 60%Ingredients: Organic Dark chocolate (organic cocoa mass, organic cane sugar, organic cocoa butter) dry cocoa solids-minimum 60%.  Soy, milk, wheat, peanut, and tree nut shared equipment.What's there to say about dark chocolate?  Its good and I enjoy it.  This one was nice and bitter with only a hint of sweet.  It was a nice little dessert at the end of the snack pack.___The whole GoPicnic box was very portable and even included a sudoku puzzle for once you were done.  Everything fit in the box quite nicely and the array of food was good, although some veggies would have been welcome aside from potato chips.~~~ST. DALFOUR THREE BEANS WITH SWEETCORNIngredients:Diced Carrots, Sweetcorn, Lentils, Cannellini Beans, Kidney Beans, Ohions, Flagolet Beans, Sunflower Oil, First Cold Prssed Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Mustard, Garlic, Tarragon, Natural Xanthan and Guar Gums.  Sauce Ingredients: Water, Fructose, Sunflower Oil, Rice Vinegar, Honey, Pineapple Juice, Natural Flavor.This little treat was kind of the odd one out.  Or at least to me it seemed like it didn't fit with the rest of the snackable items.  But it did make a good addition to lunch.  I didn't find it as portable as it claimed though.  The can was easy enough to open but that little sauce packet made quite the mess.  I know I'm clumsy but its seems a little awkward to put the tear area halfway down the packet for a liquid packet.  It also came with this tiny little fork for eating with.The taste was good, it would have been better had I been able to get all the sauce on there and it came with several suggestions for things to add to it.  It can be served hot or cold and I went for the cold rendition just because.~~~Despite this pack of goodies being described as gluten free, it is interesting to note that several of the packages on the treats inside did say that it was made on equipment shared with wheat products.  While this might not necessarily be a problem for some celiacs or gluten allergies, it is still misleading to call this pack gluten free.It was a wide array of food though and would probably bring a smile on anyone's face who was sent this as a gift.  Not all of the foods were very practical or in snack size containers, but after all, its the thought that counts right?  I did enojoy the majority of the food with only a few things being less to my taste.  If Amazon offers other snack packs, it might be worth it to go look and try them out.  I know I'm going to search to see what other little grab bags of yum are out on the site.Review by M.  Reynard 2011\"", "Well, I WANTED to like this product -- but I would NOT recommend it.First of all, the assortment of items is a bit odd.  Secondly, the amounts of the products included make little to no sense -- you get a tiny little individual-sized bag of fruit gummies and meat stick/cracker combo, and then a full-sized box of (disgusting!) bunny cookies. ??  What kind of setting is this product made for?  I would expect that the amounts of products would be similar -- i.e., either all individually-sized items or all full-sized boxes/bags -- but this 'care package' is a bizarre mix of both.  And again, I cannot emphasize enough how nasty those little bunny cookies are...I've had gluten-free things before, but never any THAT bad.NOT worth it...unless you want to go on the most bizarre gluten-free picnic of your life.  And stay away from those bunny cookies!!  Yuck.)", "\"Below is a rundown of what's in the box, with a calorie count and brief commentary. But first, a summary:If you're looking for a gluten free snack box to buy a friend (perhaps college student) or bring on a road trip, then you'll find a lot that appeals to you with GoPicnic's Care Package -- all of the snacks are gluten free. But as a result of being gluten free, the taste of some of the snacks were just downright terrible, most notably Annie's Homegrown Cocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies. If you have to eat gluten free foods, then you have no choice but to deal with the taste. But people who do not have such dietary restrictions have no reason to put up with ingredients like rice flour.Putting the gluten issue aside, there are two things that I didn't like about the box:1. Small sizes. The small serving amounts of some of the items -- like the almonds or single mini-picnic box -- do not lend the overall care package to sharing. I think the most practical use for it would be for a group of people. Even if you buy it for an individual, it's going to end up being shared, and the serving amount should reflect that. Conversely, I thought it was particular strange that the corn and bean salad is in a sealed container, and yet, is meant for two people -- so when you open, unless you have a buddy nearby, some of it will go to waste.2. The labeling of the box is part of a growing trend to make foods seem healthier than they really are. Despite the word \"\"organic\"\" appearing on most of the packaging, these are still highly caloric snacks with little nutritional value.Here's my rundown of what's in the box:Tasty Brand Organic Assorted Fruit SnacksServings: 2; Calories per serving: 130; Total calories: 260.This is a gummy fruit snack. It is flavorful and not too chewy.Banks Cracked Pepper Cassava chipsServings: 4; Calories per serving: 130; Total calories: 520.I thought this was the best tasting thing in the box. The taste is kinda hard to describe -- reminds me of barbecued fish, and I mean that in a good way. It does have a good bit of sodium: 115mg per serving.Cinnabon AlmondsServings: 4; Calories per serving: 150; Total calories: 600.Tastes like almonds with the Cinnabon flavoring.

This specific box is filled with gluten-free items - so great to have pre-packaged when gluten-free products may not be readily available in some grocery stores.  If you have kids then you'll love the chocolate and vanilla Bunnies cookies from Annies (my kids LOVE them!) and the gummy fruits (very soft and sweet!).  The chips are yummy as are the cinnamon coated almonds (treat for adults! although some of the coating was hard - more like candy).  the Go Picnic Turkey and Crunch is tasty and perfect for a meal/snack on the go.Overall I love this box of goodies and think it makes a great care package for college students, kids at summer camp or even family or friends on vacation.  The box also makes an attractive presentation - I'll post photos.  Go Picnic also has a good variety of other assortments at a great price (definitely cheaper than buying the items separately!)", "GoPicnic's Tasty Treats Gluten-Free Care Package sounds expensive, weighing in at 1.76 pounds for about $18, but there are so many reasons it's a great value.  First, it comes in a sturdy ready-to-mail box that's easy to open and use and reuse.  Second, if you don't have time to put together your own 'care package' for your college student (or anyone else), this solves the problem with healthy snacks that happen to be gluten-free without being boring.  Third, if you look longingly at the honor bar in your hotel room but don't want to take out a loan to use it, this package is an incredible substitute. The individually-packaged items tucked within are elegant in looks and, mostly, in taste.  They aren't your little brother's Twinkies and Cheese Whiz; this box provides plenty of snacks that provide a nice mix of protein and carbs.  You won't fall asleep from a sugar high, and you'll enjoy yourself immensely.The Baja Fruit and Nut Blend was delicious, and the gummy fruit snacks were far superior to regular gummies, both in taste and texture; they are less chewy and much juicier.  We inhaled them.There are 'BBQ Popchips' -- nicely spiced round potato chips that i'd happily eat again.  But the cracked pepper cassava chips weren't too exciting. They look and sound exotic, but that was because I wasn't familiar with cassava. Turns out it's at least as common as potatoes and the taste was similar, but with a heavier texture.  It you like thick potato chips, you may like these quite a bit.  The cracked  pepper is just the right spice.The only item we really didn't care for was the box of chocolate and vanilla bunny cookies.  I suspect the lack of gluten made them mildly disgusting. They had very little taste, but the aftertaste refused to go away.The Cinnabon Almonds more than made up for the bunny cookies. Oh lordy, they were amazingly tasty.Finally, the care package includes a meal consisting of a turkey stick, three-bean salad, Crunch snack and dried apricots.Loved the apricots and the Crunch.  The three-bean salad, which includes its own little spork and a packet of unremarkable dressing, was good, probably great if you're into beans.  The only thing I disliked was the turkey stick.  While the flavor was excellent - it tasted like a spicy stick of less-healthy meat - the grainy, pasty texture was too much for me. My mate chomped his half down - he didn't hate the mouth-feel as much as I did. I gave the rest of my half to our cats.  It failed miserably as a feline treat, but one of them thought it made a great toy. (In fact, he played fetch with it until it was so disgusting that we put it out for the 'possum, who thought it was fantastic.)This is a product you won't be embarrassed to bring out in front of anyone, anywhere.  There are many other GoPicnic care packages to choose from too. The two I've tried are excellent and I'd absolutely recommend this for a gift or an alternate to the honor bar.", "Ready to eat & no need for refrigeration needed or cooking for that matter. Makes a great care package for college students or to take with you when you move into a new place.Gluten-free, no MSG, no High Fructose Corn Syrup...only the turkey stick gets in the way of it being perfect for vegetarians.The Cinnabon Almonds are buttery and sweet...but they are a bit hard on the teeth unless you give them a good suck. The Annie's bunny cookies are DELISH! The Banks Cassava chips are wonderful too. Wish there were more of the Barbeque Popchips (yum!)Have yet to try the other snacks: Organic Assorted Fruit Snacks, St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad, Mariani Dried Apricots, Baja Blend Fruit & Nut Mix, and Terra Nostra Organic Dark Chocolate. But they're sure to be the same...good enough to get us to buy bigger bags of these healthy snacks!", "\"From the product description:\"\"A special selection of six of our favorite food items - five delicious foods plus a ready-to-eat GoPicnic meal. Order for home or send to someone special for college finals week, late night munching, road trips & travel or a `get well soon' gift - makes a great care package. All food items are ready-to-eat, no refrigeration or heating required; no trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, added MSG, artificial flavors or colors. A fun way to sample delicious new food items. Certified Frustration-Free Packaging.\"\"Not all foods convert well to a \"\"healthier\"\" version. This is a good variety of products, but not all the products were good to eat. The nuts, dried fruits, gummy fruit candy, and chips were excellent. Very tasty and satisfying. The cookies were inedible--they bore no real resemblance to real food--they were just plain nasty! The \"\"turkey jerky\"\" stick had a pleasant taste, but the texture was mealy and soft. The canned bean salad was cleverly packaged, but very spicy even without the addition of the sauce packet. Overall not a total miss, but definitely not a home run.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04790761321783066, 0.05312081053853035, 0.05344593897461891, 0.046371884644031525, 0.04989110678434372, 0.05477185919880867, 0.052246205508708954, 0.055954691022634506, 0.05085286870598793, 0.04859471321105957, 0.047145649790763855, 0.05780119076371193, 0.05020485445857048, 0.0425855815410614, 0.04928756505250931, 0.04649791866540909, 0.05322408676147461, 0.052814871072769165, 0.045152872800827026, 0.04212769865989685]]}
