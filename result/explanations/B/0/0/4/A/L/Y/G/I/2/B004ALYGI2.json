I have nothing negative to say about it so far, only good things!Why I bought this brand? - I will admit that I was not very sure what I am spending money on when I clicked the One-Click button and made the purchase. Let me emphasize that this was not an impulse buy by any chance, I did research a bit about 2.1 speaker systems and did consider other models, mainly Logitech and Creative, before I bought this! What worried me though was the fact that I had never heard anything about this brand or their reliability, and there was very little information available on the net, which is not a very reassuring sign. But I decided to go with this, mainly because of 2 factors:1) Aesthetics: My new build has blue led fans all through out - 7 fans on the case and 2 CPU cooler fans! So Blue was definitely the predominant theme on the desk and this added to that very elegantly. So yes the major reason I stumbled upon these and got stuck was because I was searching for speakers with some LED lighting on them. I know it is not a very technical way evaluate a speaker, but who wanted to get technical and spend a bomb on a pair of speakers for your computer - not me! I have a 7.1 home theater set up for serious listening and entertainment, this was majorly for listening to some light music while I worked and for my 2 year old son to watch Thomas (he loves Thomas) and for my amateur movie soundtracks!2) Price: This definitely is not the cheapest or the costliest out there, computer 2.1 speaker systems can be your from $15 bucks onwards upto around $400. This falls towards the lower mid range when it comes to money, which was okay with me, I was not going to spend more than $50 for a pair of speakers and I could have got a more known brand for that price, but non of those well known brand out there even came close to these beauties in terms of looks and aesthetics! It was between this andHarman Kardon Soundsticks III, if I had got the Harman Kardon for $50 I would have defenitelly bought those! :)Okay now to the actual product review:I was pretty surprised when I got the speakers. They were very well packaged and had a cardboard padding around them in the box and the speakers and subwoofer was very well protected! It comes with a 3.5mm cable!Took them out while my son was playing with the box and got it hooked up in under 5 min, this included some cable management, and referring to the manual once. I had to look at the manual because I could not find where the input jack was to which the speaker cable would connect to on the subwoofer. It looked like a screw hole at the back of the speaker, but it is the input jack (for any one who is as blind as me)!Hooked the light green 3.5mm cable to connect to the motherboard audio jack, same color (refer you motherboard manual to be sure, if you don't know) and connect the other end to the subwoofer, attach the speaker wires to the subwoofer and plug the power cord into the wall and switch it on. That's it, that is all of the setup required, no CD's to run, no software to download!Once on you see the true splendor of the blue LED lights, it looks better than in the pictures, it is definitely a good buy if you like LED lighting, if not then don't buy it because there is no way to switch the lights off, it will stay on as long as the speaker is on! I like it that way. The sound is great quality too, exceptional for this price and it plays bass very well as well, you can definitely feel it if you have them on the desk like I do!They are very stable on the desk, another added plus that I was worried about, I have had speakers in the past which were very wobbly and would tip over with the slightest force like a keyboard touching it! But not this one, they are pretty well designed for stability.The 4W satellite speakers are excellent for music, I've played all kinds on them, they all sound equally good, as good as you can get on a 2.1 setup, the sound isolation on the left and right is awesome and the drivers do a more than sufficient job. The bass comes from the 9W subwoofer and that is great sounding too. While playing games bombs and gunshots sound very realistic and you have volume and bass controls right on the front panel of the subwoofer!So overall it provides good value for money and a great looker too. My only wish is that it would have come with a remote control, that would have been great and I wouldn't have to bend and reach every time I wanted to soften the volume or bass a little bit (I place my subwoofer on the shelf under the desk and not on it)! But hey apart from that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and performance so far, reliability I'm waiting to find out, its only been a week since I started using it, will update this review if something goes wrong, although I have a very strong intuition that this will last long, if I manage to keep it far out of reach from my 2 year old! :)", "These are great speakers, and my son really liked them for christmas last year.  They have operated and lasted very well.  Happy with this purchase.", "There not the best speakers but they are pretty nicePro's:Blue lights look awesome(main reason i got them)Both the sub and speakers are light weightSleek look(they look better in person than the photos)Compact don't take up much roomSound great they don't get loud enough for a big party but definitely loud enough for music games movies and maybe a small party thoughSub sounds great it'll rattle your desk so you'd probably wanna put it on the floor or turn the bass down which it has a knob for that on the front of the sub under the volume knobLooks great with myViewSonic VX2250WM-LED 22-Inch 1080p LED MonitorCon's:Not as loud as i was hoping but not a deal breakerthere's a little rattling coming from the sub when the bass is loudClear plastic seems kind of cheapAll in all it was a great buy don't regret it at allI will update this later if i have to", "For the price (45 bucks) it is a little costly.  The lights are ok, but not a huge selling point for me.  The speakers sound very average, the sub is below average.  The speakers themselves are VERY light and VERY thin.  The plastic simply feels cheep.  However, I was looking for something relatively low cost, and something that will simply boost the sound on my laptop a notch above the 12 dollar underpowered speakers.  This delivered with my average expectations, but was far from blowing me away.  If you crank the music too loud you get a horrible distortion that is simply dreadful.  At a moderate level these speakers are tolerable.  I will spend more money next time and get a decent set.", "I just received them and haven't had them long enough but I think you get what you pay for...  For 50 bucks this is not a bad set at all.  The Bass sounds great with all the types of music I listen to.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I have them hooked up to my Mac Mini and love the Blue lighting.", "\"These things are awesome for starter speakers!! Man I love all kinds of music and I went on a youtube spree after getting these! For 50$ they are great! I personally love the blue LED lighting, but I could tell for some it might be a tad bit bothersome because they are so bright and in your face!I don't know where to write about the shipping but I would give it a 1/5 if I could. The guy from Ontrack actually DROPPED my box on the ground after getting it off the van. He slid the door open to the van, dropped one box of mine in the grass (containing these speakers) and then dropped my other box on top of it. I was so angry, why the heck would you handle other peoples' packages like that? Keep a close eye on how they handle your packages if it's \"\"Ontrack\"\" delivering it. So far it seems no damage has been done though, but I haven't tested out the other stuff that came in my boxes.\"", "i recommned these to everyone!!! i love them - very nice and very pretty to look at!! you will not be dissappointed AT ALL!!!", "I bought this set for my mother for her birthday to connect to her Dell Latitude. It really was an improvement over the small, USB powered two speake setup she had plugged in.The only issue is to make sure you do not plug the setup into a battery backup, but to a surge strip.It has surprising gusto and she loves it.", "Bought this on impulse from the photos, and don't regret it a bit .Pros:Very aesthetically pleasing - the blue LEDs light up brightly and beautifully. The clear plastic on the speakers adds another sense of sleek style.Very decent sound - not the best, but for it's price (thirty-five), is very decent. Speakers sound crisp and clear, and sub-woofer is punchy, literally! There is a front-facing canal that will blow the wig off your head if you stay close enough - beware!Cons:Just a minor one - the two speakers are made of light cheap plastic.Bottom line: if you're looking for an inexpensive 2.1 sound system for your everyday computer/laptop/portable music player/phone use, definitely consider this.A GREAT college dorm room present!", "I have only used iHome speakers for my iPod until I got this as a gift. I have never been pleased with the bass on iHome, because they're so light-weight that they start buzzing on the table when you max out. The sub on this is very heavy duty with no loose parts. I don't know why many reviews said that the bass was too heavy, because it has an adjustable knob on the front for your comfort. It's every bit as loud as I would expect from something so small. Sound is excellent, and isn't distorted from heavy bass. The only thing that they could improve would be the flashing blue lights; they flash, but not too well. Only a flicker, which isn't disappointing though. I'm extremely happy with this. The box even had a three year warranty paper. Hope this helps!Update! After about a year of use, one speaker quit working. I was so disappointed! I thought it would be a waste of money to apply for warranty since I'd have to pay to ship the old one out, and the new one in. I could adjust the speaker wire extremely slightly so they both would operate equally, but not as loudly. About 2 months later of unpleasant use, I plugged in a different audio cord, and they jumped back to life! I was laughing because it was a broken audio cord the whole time! The speakers still work great, I use them on my TV now. The only complaint that I have is the bass, because on full volume, you can hear the rush of air from the subwoofer. The construction makes air whistle instead of flow. You can adjust the bass to fix this though. I think for the good price, these will be well worth your money. I'd recommend them.", "\"This PC sound system was easy to set up and has great sound.  The bass is fairly solid.  The midrange and highs are clear with good separation.  The blue glow from the speakers is a nice touch.In addition to this BassPulse unit, I have three other workstations set up with different sound systems: The \"\"Logitech S220 2.1 Speaker System with Subwoofer\"\", the \"\"Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602)\"\" and the \"\"Genius SW-G2.1 1250 2.1 Speaker System\"\".  It's nice to have these for comparison purposes.  I always like to understand how a particular item compares to others out there.First off, it seems to me that the Logitech system generates a much lower volume of sound (but it is also a lower cost system) than the others.  The Logitech is not as attractive, either, as any of the other three.  In hindsight, I would have opted for another Genius 1250 or BassPulse system instead of the Logitech.The Cyber Acoustics system is OK, but not my favorite of the four systems.  It looks good, has decent sound and does has the convenient on-desk On/Off switch, volume control and headphone and mic inputs.  The little on-off switch, though, is so small and light that I had to tape it down to use it (it's awkward and takes two hands to move the power switch or the volume).My clear favorite of the four sound systems is the Genius 1250.  The sound is absolutely great, but the thing that sets the Genius apart is the well-designed, convenient desktop control center with an On/Off switch, Headphone jack, Volume control and Bass adjustment.  The BassPulse, by comparison, has NO headphone jack and has the controls contained on the subwoofer itself (under the desk in my case) which makes it a lot less convenient to use.  I do not leave the systems powered up (in order to save on electricity), so each time I turn the BassPulse on or off I need to pull it out from under the desk (since the switch is on the REAR of the subwoofer unit) to access the switch.My comparison ratings are:Genius SW-G2.1 1250 2.1 Speaker System  -  5 Stars  (Clear winner)BassPulse  -  4 StarCyber Acoustics CA-3602 -  4 StarLogitech S220  -  3 Star\"", "I have these speakers connected to the audio output of my digital cable box. The speakers are much better than the tinny sound that came out of the TV's built-in speakers.To be honest, the speakers won't please an audiophile with serious demands. I'm 60 years old, and my hearing is not as good as those of younger people.The speakers make my TV viewing pleasurable again, and didn't cost a lot of money.", "the best speakers i've ever had.  they look cool, and they deliver great sound.  also, they manage not to take up much room.  only has controls for bass and volume, but those are the two dials i use most."], "Gamma": [0.02939174324274063,
