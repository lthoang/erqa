It is a sleek console, with a nice, reflective gloss. The Wii is compact and quieter than my bulky but powerful PS3. There are tons of things to do besides play games, like check your local weather, but the best feature of all is the out-of-this-world technology of the motion-control! It really is something to try out for yourself.Rather than the gimmicky Playstation motion or the Xbox kinetics that are after-thoughts, the Wii was made with the idea of swinging your controller around and mimicking real actions on the screen. The effects are surprising and enthralling! It is a good idea to buy an extraWii Remote Plus - Blackand alsoWii Nunchuk Controller - Black. Games likeDonkey Kong Country ReturnsandSuper Mario Galaxy 2will need it.I mentioned that the Wii comes with most of what you need. Something else you may need to buy isNintendo Wii 480p Component Video and Stereo Audio Gold-Plated Cablebecause it comes with AV cables. If you own a wide screen TV it will look much better. Besides this, the extra remote plus and Wii nunchuk controller as already written above. Besides these things you will need to set up your internet if desired. The Wii is surprisingly Wifi! The Wii has many blocks on your welcome screen that are filled with tutorial videos that need to be watched and then deleted, to free up memory, because the Wii does not come with alot. To surf the internet you need to download its program into a block taking up roughly a quarter of your memory blocks. If you plan on purchasing and downloading retro Nintendo games likeSuper Mario Bros. 3you will need to download another program into a block, and you will need to buy some external memory cardsSanDisk Wii 2GB Secure Digital SD Gaming Memory Card - Bulk Packagingwhich are pretty cheap!The Wii is Gamecube compatible also! You can plug in 4 Gamecube controllers and start playing classic games likeSuper Mario Sunshinethat perhaps you never enjoyed before! When I was younger, I didn't have the gamecube, our family went with the PS2, so I missed out on alot of great games. It will be great to explore the many great games on that system! The Wii plays DVD games but does not play DVD movies. If you would like to watch movies you can download for free Netflix and watch streaming movies. I have Netflix on my PS3, because it is in HD and in surround sound, which the Wii does not support.I wanted a Wii badly because I am a retro gamer who doesn't really like online games. I really didn't have games to play with my family on the PS3! I wanted to playMario Kart Wii with Wii Wheelwhere everyone in the room can have fun and interact. They create memories that last forever and help keep a happy home. You will not be locked up in a dark room untill 3am playing online games and getting so mad you curse to yourself! The Wii really is about sharing experiences with people you know. There really isn't anything out there that will get my Dad, and grandparents, and the young side of my family together to play games they all enjoy! It is great for kids also! You can keep track of how long your kids play games because the Wii sends you email reports of how many hours their \"\"Mii's\"\" or game personalities, they played for and what games in particular. It gives you details that you as a parent may need such as the time and date, and what they liked playing most. You have the option of parental control also.The Wii has countless games and is the centerpiece of entertainment for a family house or retro gamer. It is neat and compact, so it can fit in even the most over-stuffed entertainment center! It can stand up or lay down right out of the box unlike PS3 and other systems. The Wii is the best console I have played since N64! And as I play more and more games I have no doubt that I will grow to appreciate it more and more. It was the perfect holiday present!\"", "Before I got this, I had PS3 and didn't think I would get a Wii because I couldn't imagine having to use 2 controllers and dated graphics.  I also had the previous systems for nintendo, including Gamecube, so I thought I could do without.I read about some of the exclusive games for Wii and I was curious to see how good it really is.  I ended up with a lucky deal, the console like new with a charger, games and 2 controllers all for under $100.  The Wii resort and sports were okay, fun but not that impressive.  Then I got Mario Galaxy and I can't stop playing it.  The 2 control idea is actually very fun and not annoying at all.In addition to all the Nintendo games I can play now like Donkey Kong, Zelda, and Wii Fit, the online store offers many of the old titles that I love from N64, SNES, NES, Sega, and a bunch of others.  My gamecube games are all playable on the Wii too, so I can now sell the cube for some money!One other thing that impresses me is that the Wii has HD capability.  If you buy a component cable instead of the original composite cable, the picture will be incredibly improved, almost like that of the PS3.A couple of things I did not like were for one: the games in the Wii store are very fixed on price like all games on N64 are $10 even games that should be cheaper, SNES games are $8.  In particular, pricing was an issue for Final Fantasy IV: The After Years (a game I've been dying to play) because you purchase the original story for $8 then each individual character story costs $3 and there are SEVEN. then there's the conclusion that also costs $8, totaling $37. Ridiculous because you can get the entire collection on PSP (new) for $25. Also they still need to add more games to the store because the selection is not perfect yet.In my opinion, some games are a bit overpriced, but not bad if you only buy some faves. But let me say this, the PS3 store, even though they offer many free stuff, are actually worse, in general.  But let's leave it at that.Bottom line, if you're a Nintendo fan and you're skeptical like I was, trust me, it's the best value for a system of the 3 (xbox, PS3).  You can play great games, use Wii ware apps similar to PS3s, and surf the web free.  It's really kind of fool proof because it is such a great value as a console.  In fact, I would give it 4 stars for the draw backs in the Wii Store, but I didn't pay enough to do that :)", "\"This is the spiritual successor to the award winning Power Glove for NES. You will love to play this for like 2 days and the stick it in a closet for all eternity. If you are a \"\"real\"\" gamer from the 80s or 90s then you can only fool yourself into liking this thing for so long. At least when you got tired of the power glove you got to keep it around as an awesome fashion accessory. I wish I still had mine so I could wear it out to the mall and turn all sorts of heads. So in some ways the power glove was better. Having the power glove entitled you to replace any reference to your hands with the words \"\"power gloves\"\".  For example:  \"\"I can't wait to get my power gloves onto that(fill in blank)\"\". Also the power glove was a good way to intimidate people. If I went to a bar with a huge bouncer I'd really behave myself, but if I went to a bar with a average sized bouncer wearing a power glove it would have the same effect. This can be seen in the equation below:When P = power glove and I = intimidation and C = coolnessP = (10000000 * I) + (infinity * C)^2Now If I was in said bar and the bouncer had a wiimote instead of a power glove I would trash the place out of principle.It's not all bad, Wii has like 5 good games so if you really want to play one of those 5 good games I guess you should buy the wii. i would also add that the wii is good if you are a little kid, a person that hates normal video games due to lack of hand eye coordination or a small animal. If you are a large animal like Bigfoot you will not enjoy wii very much unless you smash it to demonstrate your dominance to your pack. Needless to say a Bigfoot wearing a power glove would have already demonstrated his superiority by just putting it on and would not require additional smashing.Personally I am probably not the audience for this magical device, but have watched literally thousands of people bail on this product due to lack of quality software. It has basically become a marketing machine for other things like reality tv shows. I am sure Jersey Shore for wii is in the works. I can picture people fist pumping with wiimotes for points.Basically buy this if you want to suck bazillions of development dollars away from the making of quality video games.\"", "\"Highly recommended.  I bought this exact set at a higher cost in the store & then when my Mom & Step-Dad wanted it, I did the sensible thing & found this exact same thing cheaper on here.  So this order was for my Mom & Step-Dad.  It's exactly like mine at about $100 cheaper than for what I purchased it - on sale - at Best Buy. Yes I was misguided on my purchase but at least I was sensible for my parents.  It arrived perfectly at their house (I ordered it but had it shipped to them) & they love it.  Anyway...The Wii console plus motion remote, nunchuck & 2 games are wonderful & I'm glad we have it. My parents have it, my step-kids & step-grandkids have it.  My husband didn't want the kids to sit around playing video games all day when they came to visit us.  However, on Christmas day, after grandkids brought over their Wii & played their Wii Just Dance 2, not only was the game console easy for me to figure out (a miracle really) but the games involve a lot of moving around, instead of sitting around. Sure, kids need to play at playgrounds & do other physical things but this Wii game has been a fine addition & we're both glad it's here.  I use it more than anyone with my daily exercise dance games.  Then the kids & grandkids use it when they visit.  My husband only plays it when kids & grandkids are here.  Admittedly, I know very little about all of the games offered out there.  I've only been interested in the dance exercise games.  The Sports Resort & Sports games that came with the Wii are wonderful.  I always remove the disks & put them back in their cases & unplug the Wii at night.  I don't have to do this but I'm a little OCD.  When you turn off the Wii, the green light goes to red light & stays like that.  I keep thinking we're using too much unnecessary power toward the game so I unplug it. My Mom does the same with hers. We're unique. No one else I know does that.  I don't know of anyone having their Wii broken so as far as I know, it's a reliable video game system.  Be very careful with the sensor bar.  It has a thin cord & looks fragile.  Trust me, it is.  That's the only thing that broke & it was my fault.  I accidentally vacuumed up the cord & it was a bummer for me being without my Wii Fit for 5 days.  (I ordered a new sensor bar & all is well once again but learn from my lesson: get that sensor bar cord off the floor).Because we knew kids would be playing at our house sometimes, we bought 3 motion remotes (each different color) & 1 nunchuck since the Wii game only comes with one remote & one nunchuck.  You can have up to 4 playing some of the games & only 2 people playing the other games. Also, be sure to have plenty of fresh \"\"AA\"\" batteries in the household.  You'll need them for the remotes & for the Wii Fit Balance Board (if you decide to buy that game).  It's lots of fun & I love the game.  I can't compare it to anything because we've been staying away from video game systems for so long.  As far as I know, everyone is compatible with it in our little family so we're happy with it.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.031296927481889725, 0.02474743314087391, 0.1169755682349205, 0.2382904440164566, 0.5886896252632141]]}
