"], "reviews": ["I was skeptical to see this sort of delicate rice noodle made of brown rice. However, I was able to make it using almost identical methods as the traditional white-rice variety, and it worked well. Flavor is of course a bit stronger due to the brown-rice content, but it's good. (I made Singapore Noodles using the rather mediocre recipe at Epicurious.)", "Following directions, I soaked the vermicelli in warm water at room temperature for over minute prior to cooking. I then stir fried (heated olive oil and garlic over medium fire in a frying pan) the vermicelli with parsley and veggies.The vermicelli has a very distinct taste that's crunchy and seaweed-like at the same time.The package comes with two recipes, and I didn't have enough vermicelli to try both recipes, choosing to try only the first recipe on the package.Overall, this is a good alternative to TV dinners and fast food, but it didn't taste as delicious as regular wheat pasta.If you are eating gluten free and looking for an alternative to wheat pasta, however, I'd recommend you give this product a try.

I modified the \"\"Brown Rice Vermicelli in Aglio Olio style\"\" recipe (also on the package) by adding broccoli, pea pods and some other vegetables, and it was a fast and nutritious complete meal.The ingredients listed are simply brown rice, sago starch (a starch which is extracted from the pith of tropical palms), and water. What it gains in convenience and speed, it somewhat loses in flavor. I found it slightly \"\"starchy\"\" in texture, but with the right seasoning, vegetables, and seafood or  finely sliced meat, it's a good item to keep in your pantry for quick and easy meals.It's also good for people like me on \"\"limited diets.\"\" Pasta is a \"\"no no\"\" on my very restricted regimen, but this Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is a great way to \"\"have my pasta and eat it too.\"\" Calories are 209 for a 2 Oz. portion (approximately 3.5 servings per bag). I'm going to enjoy experimenting with recipes where I can use this product.\"", "\"You can use a packet of Peacock's Brown Rice Vermicelli for a nice dinner for two, provided you have some salad, a side dish and something (meat, tofu, vegetables, sauce) to bulk it up a little.The taste is a bit better than semolina vermicelli, and if rinsed thoroughly after cooking does not suffer from the starchy quality of similar products.  At something like $2.25 per packet, it's a lot more expensive than normal vermicelli, but only in comparison.  In reality, we're not talking about a lot of money, though . . . and I like to avoid gluten and never really enjoy the heaviness of tradition pasta (this product seems \"\"lighter\"\" somehow.)  I've tried similar products, but give this the edge in terms of taste, which is really what matters.  So, recommended.\"", "\"This was easy to cook, but my kids wouldn't eat it. We made a simple pasta and tomato sauce with it and I thought it was fine. I could tell it wasn't \"\"normal\"\" pasta, but I didn't think it was that bad. I reminded me of a lighter whole wheat pasta. I'd eat it again if it was just me, but I probably won't buy this since my kids won't eat it and I have to cook a meal for everyone.\"", "Vermicelli is a quick cook item that traditionally was only as offered in a white pasta. While the brown rice is not as tasty, for the most part you really can't tell the difference. I tried this product in two separate dishes. Once as an alternative to spaghetti. And the other as part of a Mediterranean rice dishand both came out great! You are getting a lot of product in this package. The downside, sort of, is the instructions says you put the product in room temperature water. That did not work out for me. I had to boil water and cook for about 4-5 minutes to get it to the spaghetti like consistency I wanted to use it for. It's a great healthier alternative to white pasta.", "\"I used these noodles to make a gluten free \"\"cup o soup\"\".  They cooked super fast in chicken broth and tasted great.  I had no issues with them making the broth too starchy.  Though this was a review item provided to me via Vine, I would not hesitate to purchase this product to use in my gluten free cooking.  They are very thin, so you'd definitely need the whole package for a meal.  However, if you're cooking for one, half a package was adequate for my needs.\"", "Easy to cook, takes only a minute to soak it with warm or cold water. Drain well so noodles won't be soggy. A good alternate to spaghetti or thicker Asian noodles. If doing it as soup, just add rice vermicelli after soup is done, no need to cook too long in soup.Works well with meat like chicken & leafy vegetables. Add soy sauce for flavor. Can make it spicy too be adding chili sauce on the side. Add grinded peanuts to make it taste like Thai food. Yum!Cooking time has to be fast, adding the drained rice vermicelli after the meat is cooked and stir fry quickly to avoid getting it too soft. Texture is finer than spaghetti. Taste more like rice stick noodles. For a quick meal it is a good noodle to use. Stir fry for best taste and it is the easiest way to make.I would recommend this to noodles lovers. Can add any variety of seafood, meat and vegetables. Need generous saucing to bring the flavor out. But it was perfect for my home and so very easy to make. 5 stars for the ease of cooking, taste, and quality of the product.", "I followed the package directions and was pleasantly surprised. My family enjoyed the taste and I enjoyed the fast, easy way to prepare it. In this day and age of gluten issues, it is nice to use a product made of brown rice. This is also a very versatile product, and the directions gives you many different ideas. Truly you can complement it with almost any source of protein or veggies.", "These are really good vermicelli noodles, which are made out of brown rice.  They are very thin, and they taste really good.  This is gluten-free; therefore it is excellent for those people who are allergic to flour (wheat).  I am not allergic to flour, but I am just saying that it is good for those who are.  These can be used like regular pasta.I received mine today, and I was so excited about trying it.  I immediately cooked some of it; in fact, it was my dinner tonight.  I ate it with a can of tomatoes, just like I would have eaten regular pasta noodles.  It was really good and tasty.  And I loved the texture.There are so many different ways in which this brown rice vermicelli can be done.  I ate it with a can of tomatoes, but I am just thinking about all the things in which a person can do with it.  It can be eaten plain, or it can be made into Italian dishes, or into Asian dishes.  I am just thinking:  these noodles would be good in a skillet with broccoli florets and baby corns, slivered almonds or orange/lemon flavor.This is a product of Singapore.  I really enjoyed these noodles tonight, and I look forward to tomorrow.  I'll make it a different way tomorrow, probably something Asian.I highly recommend these noodles, whether or not you are allergic to flour.", "I was excited to try these noodles.  I love Tai food and these Singapore noodles strongly resembled glass noodles used in Taiwanese cooking.  That is something to keep in mind, considering that these are packaged as Vermicelli (which is another word for Angel Hair) and it is far more reminiscent of glass noodles.When cooking this product I found immediate detractors, and upon eating it I found immediate plusses.  It's kind of a mixed bag that could easily be tweaked to a perfected product.Cooking this Brown Rice Vermicelli is a bit difficult.  The main problem is that the packaging instructions are vague and don't really help you much.  Soaking this product for a minute doesn't do anything.  Soaking it for five minutes also doesn't really do anything.  It takes much longer to soften.  I eventually had to just take it out of the water and toss it in the frying pan in order to get it to soften.  The noodles have a hard time separating from one another and so it gets clumpy and you have to work with it a lot in order to get it apart, which causes many of the noodles to break.  Eventually, they do get to that required texture and you're ready to eat.  The first thing I noticed when eating this product is that it absorbs flavor really well.  Some pastas retain their starchy flavor even after mixing in with a sauce or vegetables, but this product soaked in rich flavors with ease and maintained those flavors.  The texture, once softened, is quite wonderful.  While the package states that there are only about three servings here, there is more than enough to eat once it is cooked up.  We have a family of four, and we all ate till we were full and had leftovers (granted, we made a meat to go along with our pasta, but most people do).So, despite some cooking issues, this is a tasty product.  It is also quite healthy.  Not only is this product Gluten, Fat and Cholesterol free, but the entire package is only about 600 calories.  I will mention price, which can always be an issue.  You're looking at a little over $2 a package if you purchase it at this site.  That is obviously more expensive than your usual box of pasta.  Even whole grain spaghetti (which is what we usually buy) is slightly less expensive (still in the $1+ area), but at the end of the day, $2 isn't a whole lot to spend on a tasty product that can feed your whole family.This is a product that requires a simple preparation.  Heavy handed sauces would overwhelm these tiny noodles.  Some vegetables, oil and herbs will do the trick; which is also a favor to your wallet.If the package instructions were clearer and more informative, I'd give this a higher rating, but cooking should never be a frustration.  At least the eating is very good!", "\"Product description says \"\"easy to cook\"\".  Well, I suppose.  If you try the soup recipe on the bag, sure.  Boil water.  I tried the other one for fried noodles.Not Easy To Cook.  Directions don't say how much oil. After softening the noodles in water for the directed 1 minute and transferring to the fry pan - the noodles are one giant clump and very hard to turn.  Directions didn't say how long to cook.I gave it 3 stars as I assumed that if you knew how to cook rice vermicelli it would turn out ok.  Even the mess I prepared wasn't horrible - just not good.  But I couldn't give it a good rating since the it is NOT easy to cook and they said it was.\"", "This is very quick and easy to make and there is never really ever just one way of preparting vermicelli or anything else for that matter.A brown rice version is slightly healthier and great for those of us whose staple consists of rice.  3.5 servings per bag, 209 calories, 47.1 g carbs, .6 g fiber, and 3.2 g per serving.", "I was disappointed, to say the least, in this product. When I prepared it, I ended up with a sticky mass. The package directions don't give much in the way of directions for cooking--just two different recipes. I obviously overcooked the product. It was such a gummy mess that I had to throw it away. I would not try it again unless the package directions were much more specific about how to use it.", "\"The package directions say to soak the vermicelli in room temperature water for a minute before using. My water was cold, not room temp, so it wasn't plumping very much, it remained stiff. So I threw it into the pan (I was making stir fry) with plenty of cooking liquid, put the lid on and it cooked just fine. But it's delicate stuff, so if you overwork it or move it around too much once in the pan, it will result in small pieces of \"\"pasta\"\" dispersed throughout the dish.  If you want long strands, plump it ahead of time and add it to the dish at the last minute, just to heat through.Just like regular pasta, it does not have much flavor on its own, so be sure to consider this when formulating your recipes.  Reminds me a little of spaghetti squash in texture, but it won't hold up to a heavy pasta sauce, so it's more appropriate for stir frys or a light pesto.\"", "I am sorry to be doing this; I hate giving poor reviews to products. I cooked this up last night into a horrible mush.  First of all, the cooking directions are vague at best, so I just cooked it the way one normally cooks pasta, only I cooked it for a very short amount of time, because the pasta strands are so thin.Even for boiling it for less than 5 minutes, it cooked up into a mushy gunk.  Well, I ate it.  I was hungry.  One of the worst pasta meals of my life.  In all honesty, I cannot recommend this pasta.", "Before I used this product in a recipe, I read a lot of reviews here since there is not a lot on the bag. And from the negative reviews and complaints about hard noodles, what directions that are on the bag do not seem very helpful. So I went to the positive reviews and looked for guidance there.My conclusion? Ignore the soaking instruction of one minute in room temp. water. Try hot or boiling water, for a couple of minutes, stirring to separate them. Then all was well.I used them in a shrimp and vegetable soup and added them at the very end, cooking a little more until I felt they were done for my taste.That being said, I still had a couple of issues with these. The noodle are very, very, very thin. Thinner than I would like.Also, the packaging, in a bag, does not provide adequate protection and a great deal of the noodle were broken to tiny, tiny pieces. Ok, for a soup I guess, but in say, a stir fry, no.I looked at other brands in the store today and they all used a much stronger package to protect the very delicate noodles.So not at all sure I would buy these again.", "My wife and I tried this out last night. She's a diabetic, so brown rice is supposed to be better for her than white. We had the vermicelli with some well seasoned pieces of beef.My wife thought the vermicelli was OK; her only real comment on it.Personally, I am not fond of brown rice. At least when I have had it, it seems drier than white rice. I had the same experience with the vermicelli here, expect where the beef we added to it was in contact with it, then it was softer and tasty.I also prefer vermicelli that is not quite as fine as the product here.All this being said, the product was OK. If you like brown rice, you might even like it very much.", "My daughter was helping me make lettuce wraps and she soaked the entire bag of noodles before I could tell her I only wanted to use half.  We drained and refrigerated them, thinking they would most likely be mush by the time I got around to using them.  The next day, they were still firm and ready to use with no ill effects from being wet an excessive amount of time.  And, BTW, they were really good in the lettuce wraps!  We didn't have bean threads, so we decided to substitute these noodles instead.  Everyone raved over the recipe...it's highly seasoned, and the noodles absorbed all that good seasoning.  Yum!", "I enjoyed the product.  It was tasty and easy to fix.  Add a little bit of chicken and you have a meal.  I liked the fact the product was gluten free.", "Since my sister is a diabetic we try things that say free of flour, good fiber and good taste.  This product fills the bill as long as you serve with a flavorful sauce and veggies plus meat of choice.  It does have a better mouth feel if cooked slightly longer and was great as leftovers after sitting in the sauce.I have made the soup with these noodles too and it was very good as long as the broth carried the flavor.", "First off the noodles get very broken up from the packaging (probably the shipping and handling), so you wind up with nearly a quarter of a bag at the bottom in small pieces, the other problem is that they just do not have much flavor and they do not offer a great texture to the meal.  I tried to make these with some teriyaki and chicken stock, and they came out mushy and flavorless, they do not seem to absorb and flavor from the dish and they get soggy like and do not hold up after cooking.  I frequently enjoy making noodle dishes and have never had noodles that came out so bland and textureless as these did, even when cooked with intense flavor items.  I much prefer Maifun Rice Sticks, and will probably stick to them for future entrees.Maybe in certain dishes you can make use of these noodles, but for the meals that I like, I will have to continue to use Rice Sticks and Chinese Noodles.  My only other flaw with these noodles is that they get crushed in their packaging, and causes for the majority of the noodles to be broken at the bottom of the bag.", "Not good at all. The vermicelle has absolutly no flavor on it's own what so ever. It's more of a filler for a dish. I soaked it for a minute in room temp water like it said, then put the olive oil & the garlic in the pan as directed, heated it & added my sliced peppers & shrimp, then added the vermicelli as directed. It was like a paste & NO, I didn't over cook it. Very angry as it made the rest of the dish awful so I wasted my time as well as my electric cooking it & all the other ingredients I had put into it. I would personnally NEVER buy this & if someone gave it to me I'd throw it out, as I did. Lucky for me I had other actual rice to cook to use for my remaining ingredients as I did a small amount instead of cooking all of it together just in case I didn't like it. I was able to pick out the shrimps & the peppers to save them. Those items aren't cheap to buy. You may feel differently about it but I can't imagine why since it has zero flavor.", "\"I almost wrote a review for this product after using it only once.  I was not impressed with it at all.  In fact, this would have been a very negative review had I not tried it again.  The first time I soaked it for a minute like the directions said and then cooked it.  It tasted like straw!  I felt like throwing the rest of the package in the trash!  But, I decided to give it another try.  I soaked it for about ten minutes and then drained.  I used the recipe on the package called \"\"Aglio Olio  Style\"\".  Basically, it's stir fried vegetables.  I used red bell peppers, onions and shrimp.  I added creole seasoning and then the Brown Rice Vermicelli and some olive oil.  Stirred it off and on until the shrimp were cooked.  The vermicelli was very moist and soft.  It was delicious!  It actually came out like angel hair pasta.  I will be buying this again!On a side note, I was a little disappointed to note that the fiber count was not very high.  One of the reasons I like brown rice is for the higher fiber content. The total fat grams are very low.  The sugars are 2.2g and the protein is 3.2 grams.  Total carbohydrates are 47.1 grams.  It is cholesterol and gluten free.\"", "Ok, the title doesn't make much sense, but there isn't much to say about rice noodles.  I had hoped these had more of the earthy taste of brown rice but were just as flavorless as the white rice varieties.  That's not bad as rice noodles tend to be a binder for a dish rather than the focus.  Rice noodles rehydrate quickly in dishes making them versatile for last minute meals.The packing for these was disappointing.  Instead of a cardboard box, these were packed in a poly bag and had significant breakage during transit.  Additionally, the noodles were in one big lump instead of multiple smaller conglomerations thus making it hard not to cook the whole bag.Overall a nice choice for those looking for something a bit healthier and try to avoid overly processed products.", "\"I am always looking for healthier, whole grain versions of foods I enjoy.  Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says \"\"Brown Rice Vermicelli\"\", making the consumer think \"\"this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice\"\".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.The Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.If you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are \"\"easy-to-cook\"\" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.I use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad \"\"bun tofu\"\", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.A few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.Rating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.\"", "\"I have always been a huge fan of rice vermicelli, in Asian foods. The only setback is that most rice vermicelli is made from processed, refined flour. Hence, the carbohydrates are simple - not complex. This means that the carbohydrate is converted to sugar in your system, and it induces in your system a feeling of \"\"crash and burn.\"\" Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is made from complex carbohydrates. This means your body will process and convert the nutrients, more sustainably.A great recipe for these noodles is very simple and incredibly satisfying. Sautee one onion with 2-3 cloves of garlic, with a tablespoon of grape seed oil. Cook until golden brown, add 1/4 of a head of red cabbage, soy sauce, peanut butter and minced ginger. Add tofu and water softened vermicelli (soak for one minute prior to adding to recipe). Cook until all ingredients are soft. Serve warm with a cup of oolong tea on the side. Delicious.\"", "I was excited to try this since I adhere to a gluten free eating plan.  I am used to GF products costing more, and with the subscribe & save option these packages cost just under $2/package--not bad in my experience.Pasta made from rice flour IS bland which is fine, since it takes on whatever you cook with it.  The texture is good, and I think using it in a stir fry would be fabulous--I will try that next time.I would definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing it myself.  For spaghetti, my husband still prefers Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta over all others.", "The package said they don't need to be pre-soaked, but after reading other reviews, I decided that was the best route to go.  Pres-soaked for a few minutes, then I cooked with them, and they turned out pretty well.  Not sure if I would buy these (I ordered these through Vine), but they were good try try.  Added stir fried veggies and shrimp to them.", "\"I tried these noodles as part of a stir-fried vegetable and noodle dish last night. I was improvising a bit since I had never used this type of noodle before, but I was quite pleased with the results. The noodles take only a few minutes to cook right there in the frying pan, they taste good, and they really absorb the flavor of any sauces you put in the pan. I used some soy sauce andSriracha Hot Chili Sauceto make a nice spicy, flavorful dish. Again, the flavor of the sauce really does permeate the noodles, and it does so pretty evenly as long as you stir it well when you're cooking.One thing to note is that the package says they should be soaked in room temperature water for one minute before cooking. The noodles will *not* be ready to eat at that time. Some other reviewers seem to have been confused by this part of the directions on the packaging, and I will agree that the instructions could have been clearer. If you do soak them beforehand as directed, they should cook very quickly.My basic process for cooking these was as follows:1) Stir fry some vegetables in large pan with a bit of oil.2) Add soy sauce or other sauces as desired.3) Add the noodles along with a little bit of water and stir until all of the water is absorbed.4) Keep adding water, a little at a time, until the noodles are as soft as you like them.The \"\"add water\"\" step does create a little bit of trial and error, but it seemed to work out all right. By combining some vegetables, sauce, and these noodles, I was able to make a delicious meal.\"", "\"Having once lived in Japan for almost ten years, I'm a bit of a noodle freak. Ramen, soba, rice, glass, pasta, every kind of noodle is my friend. These noodles looked to be a promising candidate to join my circle of noodle friends. Unfortunately, these were a bit harder to get to know than most noodles.First of all, there is nothing on the package that tells you how to cook the noodles. There is an unhelpful (but critical) suggestion to soak the noodles in water for one minute (to soften them up), followed by two recipes. I'm assuming the recipes are a good way to enjoy the noodles (I didn't try them, however), but I just wanted to add them to some chicken soup I'd made. After soaking the noodles, I noticed that they had not gotten noticeably softer, and they were still quite bland. I decided to put them in a fry pan with some butter, and that did the trick. They softened up nicely as they absorbed the oil, and they were quite tasty after that. They were great in the soup, too. So with the preparation mystery solved, my second complaint is that the noodles are dry and very fragile coming out of the bag, and it was next to impossible to pull off a reasonable sized portion from the massive woven nest of noodles. Attempts at breaking them by hand ended with a flurry of noodle fragments all over the counter and floor (and probably the bottom of the bag of noodles, too). Same result with a knife. I suppose you could crush the bag before opening it to break up the noodles, but then where's the fun of the long, slender, slurpable noodle? I suffered through carefully pulling them apart and brushing the fragments into the pan to cook (and vacuuming the rest off the floor). But I say again, these were delicious noodles.So here's what you've got: very tasty noodles with great texture and flavor that require experimentation to figure out how to cook and that make a mess during preparation (unless you plan to eat the whole bag all at once). I'll sum them up as \"\"clumsily delicious\"\" and worth three and a half, okay four, stars.\"", "My local Trader Joe's has a similar product so I was anxious to see how this would stack up.  It is very easy to make and perfect for the health conscious person who desires an alternative to rice or potatoes.I added shrimp to my dish and it was outstanding.  The flavor was very tasty and the product was bold versus getting over cooked.  It is a good base for consumers looking to build a nice entree for your seafood, poultry, pork or even beef.
