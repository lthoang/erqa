"], "reviews": ["This chocolate is an intense semisweet. It is similar to Ghirardelli's but somewhat less sweet, and far superior to the Baker's chocolate you find in supermarkets.  It seems primarily intended for baking, but it comes in thin bars that can also be eaten. The bars weigh 3 ounces each. They are hatched in a design of large, differently sized triangles that's attractive and facilitates breaking off pieces. However, the triangles do not seem to represent any specific weight, therefore are not useful for measurement. That's absolutely the only flaw I can find in this chocolate.", "Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker is a relatively new company, begun in 1997 by Robert Steinberg and John Scharffenberger. Their commitment to making fine chocolate is obvious in every bite. These particular bars are quite excellent, having that rich full-flavor of the cacao that you expect from extra dark chocolate. And yet, they are very palatable and surprisingly smooth.This is really good chocolate - give it a try and you will be pleased!By the way, just yesterday I used some of this chocolate in making a cake, and the results were wonderful.(Review of Scharffen Berger Extra Dark (82% Cacao) Bar)", "This is a good quality dark chocolate.  It's well tempered and shiny and enjoyable in small doses as very dark chocolate tends to be.  Not waxy at all...a little powdery if you let melt on your tongue which with the high percentage of cocoa without added cocoa butter is to be expected.  Has woody and a hint of dark fruity notes to my taste - pleasant with red wine, particularly dessert wines.  Not super sweet...it does use sugar but the cocoa is definitely dominant.  Description of the bar (which I just re-read) claims figgy and peppery notes.  I could see the fig maybe, not really the peppery spiciness at all, but whatever, I'm far from a professional taster - just an oft enjoyer.For your reference, each bar is 3 oz and 420 calories for the whole bar.  For those carb counters (like my boyfriend) a whole bar (which you would probably never eat in one sitting) is 34 g of carbs, of which 12 g are fiber.Bar is good chopped up in pancakes (just saying :) as it melts well around the surfaces but has high enough melting point not to turn into syrup.  Breaks well...good sharp snappiness...a bit of an issue since two of the bars were broken into 2 on arrival but honestly do many of us care about that?A very small complaint is that it's scored into gigantic decorative diamonds which don't break evenly and which won't give even portions.  This is a bit disappointing as I tend to eat bars like this as small little treats over time and it's always nice to have squares or something similar to break easily and judge portions by.However, I did give it 4 stars for a particular reason...it's good but not better than what you should be able to find locally.  Honestly unless you want to buy it on price (at the time of writing, you'd be paying about 3.5 dollars per bar which isn't bad at all...assuming you want 6 bars), I'm not sure there's any reason to order this online as opposed to just seeking out this or some other decent brand from your local grocery store.", "\"This chocolate isn't for those who like sweet, sugary, milky chocolate.  This is intense, and only for the chocoholics who like their chocolate STRONG!I brought mine out at a party, and my friends and I sampled a bar, letting it melt slowly and savoring the flavor.  The wrapper says it contains hints of figs and peppery spiciness.  We could taste the figs, but none of us picked up on the peppery taste.  Everyone loved it.The label says it's \"\"gluten free\"\" too, so that is nice to know.Recommended for those who love intense dark chocolate.  I also think it would be great melted and used as a sauce or glaze for fruit or other desserts.  Enjoy!\"", "Full disclosure: I am not a big fan of dark chocolate.  This looked like it would be a really high quality chocolate that may change my opinion.  It didn't.  It was far too bitter for my tastes.So, I asked for the opinions of some friends who are big fans of dark chocolate.  Of the three, two absolutely loved it.  One thought the chocolate was of superior quality and unlike some other dark chocolates he had eaten, this one was one were a little went a long way and he did not need a lot to be satisfied.  The other like the nuance of the pepperery spice.  The third found a bit bitter to their liking, but enjoyed it quite a bit melted in a cup of coffee.", "I don't have a very sophisticated palate when it comes to chocolate, so I might be kind of easy to impress, but I really liked the Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bars.  The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth and does have a hint of caramel in its flavor.  It's very rich-tasting, and delicious!", "\"Looks like this is marketed as a high-end chocolate.  For real chocolate fiends with educated palates.  Like expensive wine.  \"\"soft notes of citrus and honey overtones\"\" (from the package)Well, it seems I don't have such a palate as this tastes just like plain old semi-sweet dark chocolate like I might get from Hershey.  There's nothing WRONG with it.  But I wouldn't pay more for this than generic semi-sweet.\"", "I bought these Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bars having eaten and enjoyed this company's chocolate bars which had a New Guinea chocolate base.  I've eaten one thus far and am resisting the temptation to eat all the remaining five in one sitting.  Although these are a real treat, they are expensive.  But, you get real satisfaction!", "This is a lovely dark chocolate. It's very smooth. Even my 12-year-old daughter likes it and she usually doesn't like dark chocolate. My favorite part is that I can have just a little bit and completely satisfy my chocolate craving. It's that good.", "So in our house, we're big on gluten free products. This bar states it's a gluten free confection, but I don't know if that means it's completely gluten free and made in a gluten free environment. However, the contents are as follows: Cacao Beans, Sugar Whole Vanilla Beans, and Non-GMO Soy Lecithin. I was able to eat it without any difficulty as was my daughter, but we only have a sensitivity to gluten, not a complete intolerance.The thing is, this chocolate's so delightful by itself, even though I could see it as an excellent palate cleanser for wine tastings. While none of my family are big fans of dark chocolate, other than Ghirardelli dark chocolate, I've not had such creamy, just right tasting dark chocolate. There was no bitterness or chalkiness. Also, while it didn't melt down as creamy and easily as Girardelli does, crushed and combined with heavy cream, it does make a satisfying dark chocolate ganache that works with decadently sweetened brownies or cake. A great deep rich flavor that I'd say is peppery, however not spicy. We're big fans of chilis in our chocolate here too, and no, spicy isn't how I would describe this bar despite how the ScharffenBerger marketing team did.A really interesting company I think all around, the packaging is understated but classic looking. The total fat 19 g, Sugars 8 g and Total Carb. 17 g. The bar itself is edged like big diamonds and makes it difficult to break off cleanly. Overall though, I'd say these chocolate bars would make great gifts for business associates and family alike too.", "This a fine premium chocolate. The bars break cleanly along the lines without a lot of slivers or crumbs. The flavor is some of the best I've tasted with no nasty tastes or aftertastes. It has an nice mouth feel. I haven't used it for cooking yet so I can't comment on that.So why not five stars? Unlike many premium chocolate companies like Green & Black and Divine, Scharffen Berger offers no products that are certified Fair Trade or organic. I prefer to support companies dedicated to providing the growers a better price through a certified Fair Trade or similar program, and I am willing to spend more for it. So for my chocolate cravings, I will choose G&B;, Divine, or even Newman's Own.", "This is an excellent chocolate. It isn't too sweet as many are for me.I like the idea of eating the 70% Cacao dark chocolate, which is supposed to be healthy for us, as long as we don't eat too much of it. Speaking of which, you will definitely not need more than a fraction of a bar at one sitting. As a chocolate fanatic, I could eat the whole bar, but I really don't 'require' it with this. A moderate piece works just fine, a little bit like an after-dinner chocolate. You don't have to eat the whole thing at once. After thinking about it, I think I may chop up a little and put it over ice cream. Yum!Moderation in all things, right?", "\"I love dark chocolate, but I think my tastes are a little too pedestrian because this chocolate was just too bitter and not sweet enough for me. I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of \"\"more is better\"\" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.\"", "Nice smooth chocolate and not too sweet or candy-like. The barest hint of caramel but again not too much. I have 6 bars in front of me and they will not last long.", "It took me a while to review this chocolate because I was torn.  On the one hand, I don't get to eat chocolate this rich, so I wasn't sure that it was even milk chocolate.  On the other hand, it was so rich, deep, and satisfying, that I didn't care.  So I ate another bar just to make sure.  Unfortunately, I'm hooked on this chocolate now and don't know if I can eat a Hershey bar anymore (well, okay, this chocolaholic most likely could be talked into it).  But for sure, I'm hiding the rest of this stash and not sharing with anyone.The taste is extremely rich and refined.  I found the melt factor - always important in my chocolate eating to be higher (must savor it longer to melt it in my mouth) than the milk chocolate you buy on a general basis.  This gives it a lasting taste in your mouth.Worth the extra money and definitely a wonderful product.", "\"I admit that I have never tried fine chocolate. I have never tasted anything that was 50% Cacao, not to mention 82%. After receiving the Scharffen Berger Extra Dark Chocolate bars they smelled delicious and I immediately took a bite. I was put off at first because I was expecting the sweeter more typical dark chocolate in cheap bars. This chocolate is not sweet at all, it is more bitter. After the initial shock wore off, I tried it a few days later and it tasted better now that I knew what to expect. However, it is not really my thing.In order to receive an \"\"experienced and informed\"\" chocolate opinion and do a fair review, I gave the chocolate bars to my Mother-in-Law. She has traveled the world and tried all types of chocolate. She loved these bars and ended up eating a little bit with a glass of Merlot every few nights. She said that they were a 4.5/5 stars. So, I went with her opinion.If you are unfamiliar with high quality dark chocolate, you may want to try a low percentage of Cacao to start off with. If you have experienced the finer chocolates in life, then this will probably be a great choice for you. Enjoy.\"", "Okay, I will admit I tasted this right off the bar and it was really, really good. I really think this is one of the best tasting chocolates for cooking I have come across. It melts easily and you can use it to create such wonderful chocolate dishes. A little goes a long way because the taste is so rich. It is satisfying and puts you on a whole new level if you are most familiar with run of the mill type chocolate brands (some of the more mass produced brands). I absolutely love the fact that the ingredients list is so simple: cacao beans; sugar; cocoa butter; non-GMO soy lecithin; whole vanilla beans. This really is an amazing artisan chocolate experience and I am glad I had it. Will definitely be purchasing these in the future as well - can't wait to test out some new recipes using it!", "While it is certainly true that there are other superb Bitterwseet chocolates out there that can outshine Scharffen Berger in a one on one taste test, I have yet to find one that could consistantly deliver this same level of quality at this price point and still achieve all the things we look for in a very, very dark chocolate.  One would have to have access to a dependable Artisanal Chocolatier to find that and even then, I doubt they could came in at even less than twice the price.This is why Sharffen berger is the preferred chocolate of both home and professional bakers at this busy time of year.  We know it will deliver to us a nice evenly noted Bittwersweet taste not too waxy nor overly creamy in texture and that this 70% Cacao bar can be easily incorporated into ganaches, used to melt and then coat dried fruits for Holiday platters, serve as the basis of a decadedent Southern Chocolate layer cake 6 layers high or, be snapped off into the scored triangles and enjoyed by the cook as a not-too-guilty indulgence full of flavinoids and anti-oxidants your store-bought candybar has long abandoned in the name of cheap, artificial vanillas and tropical fats to replace to Coco butter.Some people I tried to tempt with a small serving of the bar, snapped off and offered as the perfect marriage of bitter and sweet just couldn't get over their love of rich Milk Chocolate but if you make sure the bar is warmed to at least 78 to 80 degrees, very gently on a plate, it melts a little eaiser in the mouth as it warms up to body temperature and loses the waxy sensation that people eating it at a colder 65 degrees tend to report.  So if you plan to serve the bar or eat the bar on it's own, respect the coco butter's richeness and the fact that there is less of it in this dark bar.  Give the bar the time and environment it needs to warm up.  I put my oven on 100 degrees, open the door until the interior temp goes down to 80 and then slide the prepared triangles on a serving plate onto the top rack sitting on a cookie rack and leave them there until I can see the chocolate loosen up just a bit.. maybe 10 minutes at best.For cooking, well - you simply can't beat this bar.  it grates well with a microplane, easier if warmed a little, and it incorporates well into nbatters.  it melts well but make sure your recipe actually CALLS FOR a 70% Cacao bar or you may need to add some fat to get the correct texture.  Use a reliable recipe or recipe book author and do a test run if you've never cooked with this before.  I would say to save this deliciously bittersweet chocolate for your company who know a good brand when they taste it and incoprate it into the frosting of a centerpiece cake or use it in one of my favorite recipes, the Wlanut Dark Chocolate Bourbon Pie , also known as the Kentucky Derby Pie or a Christmas Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie.  The intesnity of the chocolate matches up well with a good aged Bourbon in a dessert.  In fact a good, rich yellow caked soaked with bourbon, layered with wet walnuts ( or candied Black Walnuts) between and then spread with a Bittersweet Chocolate frosting  is a grandstanding finish to any Holiday party.Viva le Sharffen Berger!  An indulgence we can all afford.  You can find a decent recipefor the aforementioned Derby Pie inDesserts from the Famous Loveless Cafe: Simple Southern Pies, Puddings, Cakes, and Cobblers from Nashville's Landmark Restaurantand find excellent Bittersweet chocolate dessrt recipes that uses this kind of quality chocolate inThe Bittersweet World of Chocolate: Sumptuous recipes using fair trade chocolate.  Enjoy the Holidays and any time of the year, really.  The nice thing about 70% Cacao Chocolate bars is that they do not melt quite so easily as Milk Chocolate so they work well in the summer recipes as well.", "Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars. The fact that this is American made chocolate appealed to me right from the start.  They offer many different kinds of chocolate.  I would consider this just a little on the dark side milk chocolate, there is just a hint of the dark bitterness.  The taste is great and melts very smoothly in your mouth.The only reason I took off half a star was because the bar itself was hard and broken in many pieces.  I think the reason for this might be that the inner foil wrapper is loosely wrapped around the chocolate and can't help wonder if the chocolate dried out a little.  Overall not quite the best but still highly recommended.", "\"Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar, 70% Cacao is one of the better dark chocolates I've tried. It's not too bitter, and not too sweet. My normal preference is \"\"semi-sweet\"\" chocolate containing around 60% Cacao, but I enjoyed the 70% \"\"bittersweet\"\". It was just sweet enough for me. The chocolate is definitely better quality than the average mass market store shelf brands, and I recommend it.\"", "I received these and the Scherffen Berger Papua New Guinea 68% series. Both are outstanding chocolate bars. This 70% percent bar doesn't quite have the readily apparent complex flavor of the 68% bar, but you can discern slight hints that they are there. The ingredient list between the two bars is identical (although different bean stock is likely used) with slightly more fat in this bar and a bit less sugar. What you would expect though as you get a higher percentage bar.I am a bit of a cheapskate when actually faced with bars on the store shelf and will tend to pick up what is on sale or lower priced. When I ordered these I wasn't expecting to taste a big difference over the lower priced offerings. These bars do taste better then most I have tried though. I won't rate my sense of taste as being refined enough to threaten anyones wine or chocolate tasting job anytime soon, but even I can pick up on the different flavors as I am eating these. They are great tasting and I would recommend.", "I decided to try two different Scharffen Berger chocolate bars for my Vine choices, and am so glad I did.  This one seemed a bit bitter for semi-sweet and I'll save the remaining bars for baking.  The bars are big and well-wrapped, and I think a decent price here at Amazon.  For my money I'll stick with the 62% cacao with chocolate nibs--truly yummy!", "To say I love chocolate is an understatement.  And oh by the way, did you know 70% cacao dark chocolate is supposed to be good for you so naturally I won't hesitate to eat this chocolate, knowing I'm getting my antioxidants in.  Many dark chocolates with higher cacao content can be less sweet but this one is just right.  You can also use it in baking too, if you can have enough willpower not to eat it on the spot!", "This is very yummy dark chocolate that you sure can't confuse with milk chocolate! It is rich and smooth and without excessive bite or bitterness. It is much more satisfying and truly higher quality than Hershey's for instance. It is easy to get just enough to be satisfied - it breaks into chunks that go down good. It's not too bitter, yet not too sweet.I have taste-tested this against the Ghirardelli and Lindt bars of the same cacao content, and the SB bar is better", "If you're looking to treat yourself with a delectable dark chocolate then look no farther than the Scharffen Berger brand. Made of fine, quality ingredients, the 70% cacao bars are smooth and rich, definitely bittersweet, and with a slight fruitiness to its flavor (as described on the wrapper rather accurately) and without the waxiness that can be found on some inferior chocolates. Since there is such a large percentage of cacao in the bar, making the taste stronger than most, I find I only need a tiny piece of the three ounce bar to curb any chocolate urge I have and far from half a bar they have as a serving (220 calories per serving, 440 for the whole bar). This is a great choice to get the health benefits dark chocolate provides. It would also make a great gift for any chocoholic in your life or be used decoratively on various desserts. A very nice dark chocolate that more than satisfies and is sure to please most anybody's dark chocolate craving.", "Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate will stun the palate of those used to Hershey's or Nestles. It reminds me of the fine chocolates I purchased at some of Berlin and Paris's famed chocolatiers. It is rich, smooth and decadently satisfying. This is definitely the cloying sweet milk chocolate of your childhood. I just love it!", "What can I say but delicious, creamy, melt in your mouth heavenly chocolate. Top of the line, a generous sized bar of chocolate. If you are going to order milk chocolate bars this is the one to buy. Love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "I was originally taken aback by this product when I received it, as I planned to do a wine and chocolate pairing with it and I got six- count 'em- six (6) hefty bars of the product.  So of course that meant a lot- and I mean A LOT- of wine pairings...As for the chocolate itself, I nibbled on one bar throughout the day, having some as a snack and most with meals.  The chocolate itself is a little on the heavy, creamy side, with a strong peppery overtone and an unusual but pleasant after-taste.  Fans of sweet chocolate will be let down somewhat, as the bars were not very sweet.  However, this allowed the natural flavor of the chocolate to shine.  The peppery taste was a little on the hot and spicy side, thus reminding me of some of the more adventurous south-east Asian or Central American food that I have consumed (with tearful, giddy glee) over the years.  This immediately brought to mind pairings with some of the sweeter white wines- Riesling and Gerwurztraminer, for the best possible Epicurean experience, but I had resolved early on to sample the pairings across a broad and representative spectrum of wines.  That said, here are the results of the pairing tests (a la Discovery Channel's Mythbusters style):Pairings with reds: totally busted.  As a group, the tannins of the reds, which impart the flavors to the red wine, generally over-powered the flavor of the chocolate.  Possibly the only exception to this was one of Trader Joe's many versions of two-buck Chuck- white merlot; however, the after-effects of this combination (and even with the wine alone) were most unpleasant.  Overall, the reds as a group imparted little in the way of sweetness and generally over-shadowed the inherent flavors of the chocolate.Pairings with pinks: marginally busted.  As a group, the pinks brought a bit of the sweetness to the table, but were either too sharp or too crisp or too acidic as a whole, thus weakening the taste of the chocolate.  In particular, the spicy peppery-ness of the chocolate was a bit subdued with these pairings, so as a group I had to pass on them.  After-effects, however, were minimal, and in a pinch, I would down a glass of the pinks with this chocolate if the pinks were the only thing available.Pairings with whites: success!  As I had suspected, pairings of this chocolate brand with Rieslings were simply divine, as the Rieslings added to the sweetness (which this chocolate tended to lack) while at the same time preserved the flavor of the chocolate.  For best effect, nibble on this chocolate- sparingly I might add, with one of the sweeter Rieslings.  The drier Rieslings fully preserved the 'edge' associated with the chocolate's flavor, but the chocolate often came across as a bit creamy.  The absolute best results arose with the sweeter Rieslings, with the sweeter the Riesling, the better the effect.  I suggest a couple of the cooler climate Rieslings out of Washington State, particularly the Hogue Late Harvest Riesling and the Arbor Crest 2008 Riesling, for the full, positively orgasmic experience.  With the drier whites, such as the Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc, the experience actually goes in the opposite direction, but in a good way, as the chocolate imparts a bit of extra sweetness to the wine.Pairings with ports and moscatos:  This one could go either way, as those of us that like hot and spicy will relish nibbling on this chocolate with a tawny port, but those of us that like a sweet, fruity dessert wine will probably be put off by the pairing of a moscato with it given that the chocolate cuts deeply into the fruity taste of the moscato.  I found better results with tawny as opposed to ruby ports (believe me, I know, as I tried two different tawnys and three different rubys), especially when it came to after-effects.  Oddly, with the tawnys, neither flavors interfered with one another, so I got the full, distinct effect of each.Finally, as a bonus for you gourmands, I had a friend who is big on cooking with chocolate use a bar to prepare her long-time favorite- pollo con mole (a Mexican dish featuring chicken and cocoa).  Apparently she ate most of the chocolate before she added it to her dish, and was positively territorial, much like a convict in the prison mess during meal-time, when it came time to eat her delicious cooking.  Although I am not very big on entres featuring chocolate, unless it is chocolate cake and/or chocolate ice cream, she came back looking for more, and willing to pay to get it.  I happily obliged- for a substantial fee of course.This is a good, nibbling chocolate that is best in small doses.  I still have a bar left, and I am torn between yet another pairing with spirits (for some reason, Gran Marnier, brandy and cognac entice me) and making a quick and insane profit off of my gourmet friend.  What should I do?  Decisions, decisions, decisions...", "I love chocolate, and  cannot bring myself to eat  low-end chocolate anymore. A  Hershey bar tastes  like plastic and sugar to me, and I'd never  bake with most  bagged  so-called chocolate chips. I will eat a high- end milk chocolate, but usually prefer semi-sweet.Somehow, I had never gotten around to trying Scharffen Berger, and I'm pleased to say I really liked it.I ate the first bar by itself over the course  of a few days. The flavor is a nice balance of bitter and sweet, with a touch of fruity acidity. The texture is firm and crisp,  with a smooth and quick melt in your mouth.Next I tried it in chocolate chip cookies- again, nice flavor and texure when baked.Third test was brownies- this chocolate gave the brownies a nice well-rounded chocolate flavor.As nice as it was in the cookies , at this price I'd probably reserve this for more  fancy chocolate-centric desserts.As a stand alone treat, it's very nice.  In addition to the taste, darker chocolate can be healthy, and this even has a bit of fiber in it.", "Remember that this is dark chocolate- almost to the point of being baker's chocolate. To me, it was more bitter than sweet, which is to be expected. I can see eating a full bar over the course of a week, but probably not any more than that.Also keep in mind that each bar is 2 servings, and each serving is 60% of your saturated fat, which is another reason to eat it in small doses.If you're a dark chocolate snob, you'll probably love it. If you're a dark chocolate fan, it may be a bit much for you.", "I eat a lot of dark chocolate, I have slowly climbed the ladder and gotten to the darker the better, I also prefer organic, and environmentally friendly. While our house hold found this to be tasty it doesn't quite has the cacao taste we have grown to love, I would defiantly try their darker versions.  Now if you're new to dark cacao I think this is a perfect starter, I had people that normally curl their noses at my normal bitter offerings and they happy gulped this Scharffen Berger down. I found the history of the name interesting if you're interested at all in companies and where your food comes from Google it.", "\"There's no question Scharffen Berger chocolate is delicious, but equally appealing is Scharffen Berger's attention to detail and its commitment to making some of the best chocolate in the United States. Scharffen Berger scours the globe to find the world's best cacao beans and performs the entire \"\"bean-to-bar\"\" process in its factory. I like that the company focuses on perfecting the natural cacao flavor through careful blending of different varieties of cacao beans instead of just loading it up with sugar and other ingredients and declaring it finished. The result is high-quality chocolate that is superior to the cheaper mass-produced chocolate--and without a lot of unnecessary ingredients (I count 7 ingredients on the label). If you're a real chocolate snob (or just want to justify the price to yourself), you'll also appreciate the artisan chocolate-making methods and the use of vintage European equipment in the manufacturing of this chocolate.The verdict: Scharffen Berger chocolate is delicious and the bars are big enough to last more than one sitting (at least for me). It's also more expensive and, depending on your chocolate budget, may be a reason to cut back on the cheaper stuff in order to savor the good stuff from time to time.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.031708549708127975, 0.027181904762983322, 0.028413446620106697, 0.03209059312939644, 0.03421438857913017, 0.030606014654040337, 0.03453802317380905, 0.03313934803009033, 0.03520263731479645, 0.03218936547636986, 0.029128655791282654, 0.035662971436977386, 0.028571022674441338, 0.02945883944630623, 0.03261885419487953, 0.02837607078254223, 0.03336193412542343, 0.024686766788363457, 0.034403715282678604, 0.029363837093114853, 0.029814524576067924, 0.035283323377370834, 0.031900741159915924, 0.036298464983701706, 0.024193746969103813, 0.031250063329935074, 0.03403685986995697, 0.03453264385461807, 0.02819974161684513, 0.029589660465717316, 0.030161315575242043, 0.029821934178471565]]}
