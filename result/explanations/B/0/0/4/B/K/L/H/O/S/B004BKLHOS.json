"], "reviews": ["I love the concept of a healthier graham cracker, and this one is very tasty. All you notice is the honey graham -- the oats don't interfere with the flavor. The cracker is just a little dry, so I found that I needed to have a drink nearby to balance it out. That's the only reason it doesn't get five stars. Otherwise, this is a great idea and it was well executed. Very yummy!", "\"I, too, thought that Back to Nature made slight compromises with taste and texture in order to offer only healthy, whole grain ingredients in their Golden Honey Oat Grahams.  However, I didn't find the difference to be any greater than that between, perhaps, a brand-name and a generic \"\"unhealthy\"\" brand.  Obviously, it will depend on your and your family's tastes whether the less-sweet flavor and heavier, more-dry texture is an acceptable tradeoff in order to choose a healthier product.  I certainly felt it was close enough that I would let \"\"more healthy\"\" make the decision.\"", "\"Our family goes through a ton of graham crackers.  We always buy big packs, and are partial to our name brand (H. Maid), so I was eager to try another brand.Likes:- Smell: these smell great.  Fresh cracker w/ honey aroma.- Texture: these are a little firmer and crunchier than our usual name brand.- Flavor: good overall flavor.  Wheat and honey nicely balanced.  Similar if not slightly less sweetness than other brand.- Nutrition: better.  Similar amount of sugar (7g per 28 g serving), but more fiber (2g versus 1 for name brand).- Ingredients: maybe slightly less processed than name brand.  I personally consider evaporated cane juice to be 99.99% the same as \"\"sugar\"\".Dislikes:- The box is a little small for our family of graham cracker fanatics.  10 ounces can go pretty quick here.Overall a very tasty graham cracker. The great flavor and extra bit of fiber make it a win in our book.\"", "The BACK TO NATURE HONEY OAT GRAHAM CRACKERS aren't too bad. They're made with healthier ingredients like whole grain wheat flour and whole grain rolled oats - although they aren't 100% whole grain - and no added high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavor like the more popular brandNabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers 4 Pack Value Box.Each cracker comes on a sheet of four, and they have a semi-sweet taste with a slight hint of cinnamon. They're very crisp and provide a nice crunch, so they're pretty good if you need a little snack, but some might find them on the dry side.If you're used to eating the Honey Maid brand graham cracker, like I am, you won't be fooled by BACK TO NATURE, but these provide a healthier alternative especially if you're trying to cut out corn syrup and other additives from your diet, and they taste pretty close to the other brand. I like them and so I'll be making the switch to these.", "We all know how graham crackers taste like by now.  We've used them in our ginger bread houses back from elementary school building our marshmallow buildings.  Okay if that wasn't you, it's fine.  Back to Nature's Golden Honey Oat graham crackers - they are perfect for the health conscious afternoon snacker.  They're 100% natural (no preservatives, flavors, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup).  They're similar size to your Honey Maid crackers but does taste more natural.  There's more of a crunch to them and you can see the dried pieces of oats on top.  They're slightly less sweet as the Honey Maid brand but overall very satisfying.", "If you like Graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product.  Just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat.  I only wish it had less sodium (130 mg).  Apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers.  I would buy this whole grain product again.", "I don't buy regular graham crackers, because they are SO full of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc.These graham crackers are sweetened with evaporated cane juice, raisin paste & honey, not processed sugar, and  their taste is like a traditional graham cracker I remember from the late 60'/early 70's... before the high fructose corn syrup invasion. They taste oaty, a little nutty, and have a hint of cinnamon & honey. A lot like oatmeal cookies & with similar ingredients.These are probably healthier, and more flavored with oat, which tastes better to me than traditional wheat, yet these are NOT wheat free, so if you have a family member on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, these aren't for you!If allergies/sensitivities to wheat are not a problem, these are wonderful (& likely far healthier than regular graham crackers made with processed everything.)Ingredients are listed as: Graham flour (Whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking sods, monocalcium phosphate) sea salt, cinnamon, vitamin E to help protect flavor.Nutritional Facts include 4% DV of Total fat (0 saturated), 0 cholesterol, 5% sodium, 2% Potassium, 7% total carbs & 8% total fiber, so is a great snack with fiber (lacking in most crackers, etc.)A little higher on sodium than I'd like to see, but better than most snack foods out there!NOT FOR THOSE WITH A SENSITIVITY OR ALLERGY TO WHEAT!Manufacturer uses minimum 55% post-consumer content, 100% recycled paperboard in their packaging.", "I have always hated graham crackers. It seem to be a hugely popularsnack when i was a kid and my heart always sank when they were offeredto me. It is also often the crust on the bottom of many homemade cheesecakes, which i would always scrap off. However, after giving these a try these have a good bit of sweetness, but are not sugary. These do make a good snack, and i enjoyed them.", "\"I enjoyed these graham crackers.  The taste was fairly similar to the Nabisbo grahams we usually buy, but the texture was more dense, sort of like a Wheat Thin.  There are probably those who would equate this with \"\"cardboard,\"\" but I liked the crunchiness.\"", "These grahams taste good, but this is not rocket science, just graham crackers. I'm not sure what more to say.", "I was a little worried at first about how these grahams would taste.  Just judging from the box, they don't look that appealing.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  They tasted almost as good as a regular honey graham, but with the added benefit of the oats and whole grains.  l liked that all the ingredients were natural and that there didn't seem to be a ton of sugar in them.  My kids thought they were great, too.", "\"I really enjoyed these graham crackers a lot more than I ever remember liking graham crackers.For one thing, they are made with real graham flour, something that is generally lacking in most mass produced graham crackers.  I think the oats add even more to the wonderful graham texture.As far as sweetness, I am not a fan over overly sweet things, and this, to me, was just right, a touch on the sweet side; but still very tasty. I will never even bother with the regular \"\"graham\"\" crackers again!\"", "\"I found these grahams to be very good.  I think the thing I like most about them is the crisp texture.  If you have eaten a Nabisco honey graham cracker lately you will probably remember that while they may seem somewhat crisp when you first open a packet of them, they soon absorb every water vapor molecule in the room and get sort of soft.  Anyway, the \"\"Back to Nature\"\" grahams don't do this!  They are crisp, and have a good flavor.  I rate them higher than Nabisco's.Here's what my wife had to say about them...You know me- you just can't stop me from being ultra helpful.  In that vein, I decided to open up your Vine grahams box and give them a whirl.  LOVE them.  LOVE everything about them.  One a scale from 1-5 stars, they are a 6.  I am sure the price isn't cheap, but if money wasn't an issue, I would buy them exclusively and eat them daily.  They are better than Oreos and even healthy.  In fact, you feel like you are doing something virtuous for your tongue and you abs.  Super crunchy and loaded with flavor.  I am going to hide them from the kids and splurge myself- the kids can eat the Goldfish.  Love the enviro-freindly packaging too (minimum of 55% recycled cardboard), as well as their support of The Nature Conservancy.  Whole grains (wheat and oats) at their finest.So, all in all, as far as graham crackers go, these are top notch.  They don't taste like health food while being healthy, and at the same time allowing us to contribute to a good cause!5 stars!\"", "These Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are tasty and healthy. The ingredient list is impressive in its wholesomeness, and the crackers are not too sweet which is a good thing. The box is also made from recycled materials.I've been enjoying eating these for breakfast. Each box contains 3 individually wrapped packages of seven crackers, so it's easy to throw a package in my purse to take to work and munch on.", "\"Graham crackers the way they are meant to be!  Light, crispy and with just the right amount of \"\"flavor\"\".  Or maybe it's just the adult version of graham crackers.  :)  I also provided the nutrition data pic there fyi.Ingredients: GRAHAM FLOUR (WHOLE GRAIN WHEAT FLOUR), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, SAFFLOWER OIL, HONEY, RAISIN PASTE, BROWN RICE SYRUP, LEAVENING (BAKING SODA, MONOCALCIUM PHOSPHATE), SEA SALT, CINNAMON, VITAMIN E TO HELP PROTECT FLAVOR. CONTAINS: WHEAT.\"", "I like these graham crackers very much. The flavors of oat and honey came through in a nice way, and there is a good crunch and chewiness.", "First the graham crackers themselves:  They are delicious - what more can I say?  I normally only buy graham crackers to grind up and use as a pie crust.  These I like to eat by themselves as a snack - they are truly that good.  Second, they are good for you.  They use whole grain flour and wholesome ingredients - I don't feel guilty eating them or feeding them to my kids.Next - the packaging: Excellent.  The packaging is made from recycled materials - more than half from post consumer waste.  And the inks are from vegetables so are safe and biodegradable.This company has done a wonderful job at producing an awesome product - way to go!", "These little beauties were a big hit in our busy household... oh..um.. if you get a chance?.. try them with a bit of cream cheese on them. Yumsville!", "\"Have you always liked graham crackers but felt now that you are \"\"grown up\"\" they are something you don't want to be seen eatting?  Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams solves this problem.  They have the taste of our kids graham crackers but are more of a cracker than the crumbly graham crackers we knew as kids.With a bit of oats and honey added to the graham cracker taste, you have the perfect adult graham cracker.\"", "I wish I could say these are just like Nabisco graham crackers. I think their intention was good, lots of organic ingredients and all. But to be sure, they are not as good.  No straight sugar, though, so that's a plus. I gave them 3 stars for the small amount of fiber, the recycled packaging and their commitment to quality food. Unfortunately my taste buds clearly swing to a more typical graham cracker.", "\"This variety is softer than the apple cinnamon crisp version, but my husband just loves them. that gives me some peace of mind, since they do contain whole rolled oats. I don't care for them much myself. I like crispy graham crackers. don't think these would be good for baking, such as pie crusts or crispy crumbled toppings. But I've been \"\"ordered\"\" to get these and the apple cinnamon variety on subscribe and save auto-ship (if available) since our local stores don't carry them. :o)\"", "\"A very nice graham cracker, with a robust oat/flavor. Very crunchy. The \"\"hint of cinnamon\"\" is definitely easy to taste, yet adds a nice flavor that is just sweet enough due to the honey.  This is a cracker that is just sweet and savory enough to serve as a sweet snack, but also was very yummy with cheese or peanut butter.  I love graham crackers and this one is great.\"", "These taste amazing!  The company didn't get the flavor exactly the same as a box of Nabisco grahan crackers, but it is darn close.  The health factors are a good balance because these aren't the healthiest things on the planet but they have a great taste which is hard to get without sugar.  Overall, these are very healthy and they are a good source of whole grains.  Of course, they are also expensive.  Ounce for ounce they are more than double the cost of graham crackers and my store puts Nabisco on sale BOGO often enough to make these effectively 4 times the price.  Plus you have to buy 6 boxes at a time to get that price.  Since price is a consideration, I won't purchase these again.  However, if you are less thrifty than me, and you want a good cracker at any price, these are right up your alley!", "I really enjoy eating the sugar laden graham crackers, but I prefer these 100% natural honey oat grahams now. These are satisfying with the oats and the honey adds a slight touch of sweetness. I use these to hold me over until lunch time, but they are a great snack for any time. One pack contains a fair amount of graham crackers and at this price, I think its a great value for six boxes of these delicious grahams. I will never go back to unhealthy standard graham crackers. These oat grahams revived my love for grahams.", "I have to admit it was with some trepidation that I picked out these graham crackers to try: my last Back To Nature product, a type of strawberry cereal had not gone over very well.  I couldn't even make it through a bowl.So I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked these graham crackers.  They have a light cinnamon & honey taste, plenty of dietary fiber, oats, and whole grains. They also have no high fructose corn syrup and no hydrogenated oils.  I shared them with some friends, and they all liked them, too.The crackers are a little dry, and they are not perforated very well, so they break apart in funny shapes, but they are very good.  I suggest maybe a little natural peanut butter or some hummus to cut the dryness of the cracker.The bottom line: Loaded with munchy goodness!", "This is my second flavor of Back to Nature Graham crackers and I'm just as impressed with one as the first.  The crackers are simply crackling with flavor and crispiness.  There isn't much to say about graham crackers except that I've eaten all of the major brands for many years and these are the best of the them all.", "\"I love graham crackers. But, being overweight and over fifty means I don't get to eat grahams very often.  That may all change now that I have sampled these Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams, courtesy of the manufacturer.  They have a very satisfying graham taste, not thinned out like so many competitors' \"\"healthy\"\" crackers that are \"\"good for you\"\".  I love the snappy crunch and also appreciate that, although there is a good amount of whole grain oat fiber in each square, they don't have that grainy, fibrous texture other snacks do.  I will always want the full-on graham cracker, of course, but these Honey Oat Grahams are an enjoyable, healthy alternative.Try them guilt-free for yourself.\"", "\"i love graham crackers and these were just ok.they were a little dense for me and really didn't have that \"\"graham\"\" taste like the normal ones you find in the store.they weren't horrible but they weren't my favorite.  i would buy them only if the store was completely out of normal graham crackers.i just didn't care for the dense feeling, the lack of \"\"grahamy\"\" taste and just the overall graham cracker feeling.\"", "i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious.  i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious.  both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste, less subtle than other graham crackers.  i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie.  with no hesitation she said yes.  this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips.  lana is with me in highly recommending BACK TO NATURE GOLDEN HONEY OAT GRAHAMS.", "We tried these as a replacement to the Nabisco Graham Crackers and there are really awesome.  They have no transfats and while not organic, taste just like the Nabisco ones that I grew up with.  My kiddo loves them as well.  They've got an oat dusting on the outside of the crackers that really makes them pop.  I would definitely recommend!!!", "I love Graham crackers and these taste great but this one is 100% whole grain with all natural ingredients. My whole famly have been snacking on them all weekend and shh don't tell them they are healthy!2 full cracker sheets are 110 calories with 20 from fat. It has 85mg of Potassium and 2 g of Fiber...", "\"Compared to other graham crackers, they are slightly more dry and slightly less sweet. They do have a heavy, substantial, oaty texture that I kind of liked - makes them feel like a breakfast food and not just an after-school snack. They are more messy than other graham crackers though; they don't break evenly and generate a ton of crumbs.They are labeled \"\"100% Natural\"\" with no high fructose corn syrup, and even the packaging is made from 100% recycled paper and printed with inks from vegetable renewable resources. So if this is important to you, these crackers will be a good pick.
