After trying out several units in the $100.00-$200.00 price range I took a chance on this one and was glad I did. The SFQ-1 offers the best sound and features of any unit under $200.00.First of all the sound is pretty darn close to Bose quality with great highs, mids and pretty darn good bass response and is LOUD. The streaming bluetooth was a snap to setup for my touch, Ipad and EVO. The EQ is pretty nice but fairly limited but considering how good this unit sounds I believe this is only for \"\"tweaking\"\" the sound.I also like the small added touches this unit has like the FM radio, the storage compartment for the remote and the free app you can download from Itunes. Only issue with the app is that it forces you to build a playlist and not import the ones you've already made on itunes. No biggie since it was free I really have no complaints and doubt I'd use it.I think Soundfreaq has a pretty bright future if it keeps churning out quality, well thought out units like this one.\"", "This is the best sounding bluetooth speaker I've tried, and I've tried a LOT of them (Creative, Logitech, Jambox, Monster, etc...). As everyone knows, bluetooth (BT) sound can only get so good, as it is a compressed signal. Every device processes that signal a bit differently, producing a mixed bag of results. The SFQ-01 is by far and away the best sounding unit of the lot.It's a medium sized speaker that fits in well with most modern decors. The black unit comes with an orange display, and the white unit comes with a blue display. I honestly don't like the orange with the black, but the white speaker just didn't fit in with our decor.It's super easy to connect a device - just scan with your phone and pair it. That's it. You can download the SoundFreaq app to customize things (auto-connect when in range, etc.). To be honest, I didn't use the app.It has a slot in front to put your iPhone. I'm one of the 5 people on the planet that doesn't own any Apple products (can't stand them or what they stand for as a company). I digress. But apparently this charges your iPhone while playing songs, which people find convenient.Using this with my Android phone is flawless. I just connect and start playing Rhapsody. The UG3 EQ setting is phenomenal - far better than any of the other settings. So I just leave it on that. The mids, highs and even bass are fantastic. It's not lacking in any area, which is really saying something for a BT speaker.The unit gets loud enough, though this won't blow down the doors. If you're looking for a BT speaker for a super large frat party, this probably isn't it. But for great sound and convenience, this unit should be on your short list.It's a little overpriced IMO, but honestly I'd do it all over again. I've tried many BT speakers in all price ranges, and this beats all of them hands down (even the >$200 ones). This is the best BT speaker for the money you can get right now. Don't hesitate!", "After laboring in the satanic mills of Amazon's customer reviews for some five years, I finally have a product that makes me want to sing with joy. So, this is not the technical type review you have probably already seen about the Sound Freaq bluetooth music player.A little confession here: I got this beauty on a one day Amazon special for about one hundred and fifty dollars (trying to avoid the Amazon bot that erases prices and URLs gratuitously supplied by customers) and am I ever happy! Unboxing revealed a well designed package with a really big power brick which was at least as big as the one my laptop uses. I think it's three amps at about eighteen volts with a reasonably long cord. I straightened out the wire antenna, and plugged it in the back to see how it got my local FM. It starts off by scanning from low to high. Got my local classical station, turned up the volume to about 20 out of 30, and listened to some of the best FM I've heard for a while. FM scrunches the dynamic range a bit normally but it looks like the engineers at Sound Freaq have its number: the dynamic range was the best I've heard from FM, so it looks like I'll be able to enjoy my local stations much more now.I didn't test the external sound input feature nor the iPhone input either. But the bluetooth got my attention right away. I bought this unit to use it with my iPad so after reading the handy quick use guide on the top of the box inside I went online and downloaded the Soundfreaq remote app in the iTunes app store. It's fairly basic as a remote. It has a drop down menu of your iTunes songs. But you don't need the app. After you are paired, just go into the ipod music app and make a selection. You should get the sound immediately.First, though, set the Sound Freaq unit to bluetooth mode, duh!, a little nicety I forgot - it won't pair up unless you do. Next go into your iPad/iPhone/iPod system management (you should know where that is) to make sure bluetooth is ON.Next, if they are now pairing successfully, all you have to do is touch the SOUND DEVICE bar on the same page to tell the iThingee to pair up. Voil&agrave;!As you are pairing devices, an orange bar in the center of the lower part of your Sound Freaq starts blinking every three seconds and keeps doing so until you turn one of the devices off. Keeps you from wondering if your bluetooth connection is up; it's hard not to notice.If the Sound Freaq wide dispersion mode is on, you will not be able to adjust the bass and treble. Get out of that feature if you want to adjust manually. Don't know why anyone would want to do that, though. The sound dispersion, base down to one hundred cycles (hertz), and fantastic mids and treble amounts to the best you are ever going to get from a unit this size and price.As a matter of fact, I placed this on top of my two Polk tower speakers side by side: a good use for them since I never was really happy with their performance coupled with my Onkyo 50 watt receiver. Can you imagine being happier with the Sound Freaq than with a dedicated receiver and tower speakers?And I don't mean to disparage that fine brand of small radios and CD players made in Framingham, Massachusetts either, but frankly this is a much better deal. My advice is don't pass it up. I'm thinking of getting another for the patio ...UPDATE:Have to remember that when attempting to link a bluetooth device such as my cell phone music function or my iPad, set your bluetooth enabled device to searching function, then set the Soundreaq to bluetooth and REMEMBER to press the tiny LINK button on the extreme right side. I haven't had any problem since I started remembering to do that!!", "I was skepitcal of getting a Bluetooth based speaker system. From others that I have heard - the sound quality is just not there. This little unit delivers great sound and there are no issues with connection. I stream music from my laptop all the time and it is great. The sound is rich and can get pretty loud for such a relatively small device. It is well made and actually looks good. Overall - a great little audio system.", "What everyone says about the sound and design is true. I enjoy this device very very much. I'm hoping the product designers will read this and make this device perfect.- The knobs to control bass and treble are pointless, I can't hear any difference when those knobs are all up or all down.- If you made those analog knobs into volume, source and radio tuning which are currently unsatisfying push and hold buttons, it would be a great boon to the device. Knobs and sliders are very pleasing in a tactile way.- bluetooth connection takes over my iPhone when the device is turned on, even if it's turned on in radio or iPod dock mode. Bluetooth should only connect when the unit is in bluetooth mode.- FM reception is mediocre. I have the antenna taped to the window to get even the most powerful stations.Other than that, this thing is great.", "as good as the bose - did an ab test with them and very much more reasonable priced.use in my sewing room with my bluetooth devices - galaxy 3s", "\"This is a sharp looking, great sounding, little unit. For the money it will be hard to beat the sound quality. The FM radio works well with the supplied antenna (which is just a thin little black wire about 18\"\" long). I found it very easy to connect with my blue tooth devices. The remote control is small and works well too. I have an Android phone which sits in the cradle on this perfectly. Too bad it wont charge while sitting there like the I-phone will.The down sides are that it has a very poorly located obtrusive power plug in the back keeping you from being able to set it back against a wall flush. The next negative is the power cord with a V regulator that is the size of the one's that come on most laptops. This thing is difficult to hide and is about is pretty as a dogs dirty azz...\"", "\"The first unit I got lasted for 15 seconds. Poof...dead.The second unit survived.This audio system lacked the full sound I would consider being good. The high frequency is very pronounced and there is some decent bass for such a small box. The problem is the is missing sound between high frequency/mid frequency and mid frequency/low frequency.The origional placement was in a very large room with a high ceiling, ceramic tile floor. the unit was placed on a marble counter. The sound was harsh and tinny with deep bass.Adjusting the controls to improve the sound was futile.I moved it into a smaller room with some textile surfaces. It was much better. Not great...but OK.If you consider the other options this may be one of the better choice for a self-contained small unit where placement of a real stereo system isn't practical.I ended up returning mine. I bought it at a greatly reduced \"\"Gold Box Deal\"\" price but it wasn't worth the money.  This was my first return ever with Amazon for product disatisfaction.Could I have been sent 2 lemon units? Possibly, but this is my experience.\""], "Gamma": [0.0333169661462307, 0.03211807459592819, 0.0321156270802021, 0.0321156270802021, 0.0321156270802021, 0.03216037154197693, 0.03222447633743286, 0.0321163609623909, 0.0321156270802021, 0.0321156270802021, 0.6774855852127075], "Beta": [[0.1278495192527771, 0.004792564548552036, 0.0021075070835649967, 0.09611646085977554, 0.6306392550468445, 0.0794188380241394, 0.0011054396163672209, 0.05797034502029419], [0.12803688645362854, 0.004779879003763199, 0.002102856058627367, 0.09596873074769974, 0.6307898163795471, 0.07931594550609589, 0.001104911440052092, 0.05790102109313011], [0.1280377060174942, 0.004779680632054806, 0.002102782716974616, 0.0959676206111908, 0.6307912468910217, 0.07931555062532425, 0.0011048649903386831, 0.05790052190423012], [0.1280377060174942, 0.004779680632054806, 0.002102782716974616, 0.0959676206111908, 0.6307912468910217, 0.07931555062532425, 0.0011048649903386831, 0.05790052190423012], [0.1280377060174942, 0.004779680632054806, 0.002102782716974616, 0.0959676206111908, 0.6307912468910217, 0.07931555062532425, 0.0011048649903386831, 0.05790052190423012], [0.1280326396226883, 0.004779603332281113, 0.0021027899347245693, 0.09596811980009079, 0.6307940483093262, 0.0793168693780899, 0.0011047149309888482, 0.05790119618177414], [0.1280200034379959, 0.004780956543982029, 0.0021032586228102446, 0.09598223119974136, 0.6307752132415771, 0.07932587713003159, 0.0011049401946365833, 0.05790749564766884], [0.12803761661052704, 0.0047796787694096565, 0.0021027829498052597, 0.09596762806177139, 0.6307913064956665, 0.07931557297706604, 0.001104863011278212, 0.05790054053068161], [0.1280377060174942, 0.004779680632054806, 0.002102782716974616, 0.0959676206111908, 0.6307912468910217, 0.07931555062532425, 0.0011048649903386831, 0.05790052190423012], [0.1280377060174942, 0.004779680632054806, 0.002102782716974616, 0.0959676206111908, 0.6307912468910217, 0.07931555062532425, 0.0011048649903386831, 0.05790052190423012], [0.11683664470911026, 0.004602339584380388, 0.0021166005171835423, 0.0970703512430191, 0.6367233395576477, 0.08239122480154037, 0.000808518729172647, 0.0594508983194828]]}
