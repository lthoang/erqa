I used everything to learn guitar including youtube videos, DVDs, books and lessons from friends (not pro but still).Then last year, Rockband 3 came out which works with a real guitar. I never played Rockband games before but went out bought $300 Rockband guitar and $40 midi controller and the game. Initial lessons in Rockand 3 were easy but I quickly hit the wall. The cool thing was that Rockband would let me slowdown the song speed and let me learn at slower pace. However, there were 2 flaws with this approach. It was very boring. Sometimes even the slowest speed was not slow enough for me. After a while I got bored with Rockband and listed the guitar, midi controller and game on the Craig's list. It was time to call it quit.One guy came to my place to check out the guitar and the game. While he was testing the game, he mentioned Rocksmith. And said he thought it was a better game. Luckily, he didn't buy the guitar.I searched a bit on Rocksmith. I decided what the heck, let's try it out.At first, I was just following their main journey and sucking at every song. Then I discovered Riff Repeater menu. This changed my world. Normally, first, I try Leveler. There I learn a part of a song until it becomes too difficult to finish at the full speed. Then I go to Free Speed option and practice until I can finish the song at full speed. In Free Speed, it slows down if you make a mistake. This combo has been best for me, so far. For some reason, difficulty level rises smoother than Rockband 3 and I don't feel I am getting stuck anywhere for too long.Well actually I did get stuck. I was hitting right notes on low E sting but it was registering those notes slightly off. Guitar was tuned perfectly. So I thought there was a bug in the game or perhaps my Rockband 3 guitar was broken. But unlike Rockband 3, this game had given me enough confidence to say that it wasn't me but something else. After some search I found out that most likely the E string needs to be intonated. I had no idea what it meant but learned something new. If you are having same issue where you hit the right notes but the game register it slightly off, then most likely you need to get your guitar intonated too.I have been playing Duck Hunter a lot too. It helps in moving fingers fast and building muscle memory.Okay some flaws: as others have noted, it does have a slightly long loading time. I wish, in Riff Reapter there were no lives. You can play as long as you need to get it perfect. Right now after 5 tries, it exit and you have to load it again. I wish game had more guitar basics or troubleshooting options. Like help with intonating a guitar.In the end, I feel like I can learn guitar finally. If you want to know how much fun this game is, I have stopped playing Uncharted 3 half way since I got this game.", "\"I found this game to be the best way for someone who doesn't know how to play the guitar to learn.I personally know how to play (somewhat), but I am having a good time going thru the steps and also it is forcing me to not look at the fingerboard.I HIGHLY recommend this title for anyone who wants to learn how to play a guitar.My only problems:1. This one I feel is major.  Many people picking up this game will no doubt have an inexpensive guitar.  The tuning feature is great in theory, but it is too forgiving.  I found that even though the game thought that my guitar was in tune, something sounded off.  I hooked my guitar up to a tuner and tuned it more accuratley and it worked much better. That in itself is not my issue.  I am about 15 or so songs into the game and it had me change the tuning on the guitar.  I have decades of experience with many different guitars and I can tell you that if you change the tuning on a guitar, especially a cheap one, you will be tuning for a while to get it right.  It is simple physics.  When you change the low E string, you reduce so much tension on the neck that every other string is affected and the same goes for putting it back in regular tune.  This is all well and good and is something that a guitar player would eventually have to learn, but I think they threw it way too early in the mix and didn't explain the pitfalls to the newbies.2. There is a song where someone RAPS.  This game is called Rocksmith.  Take a lesson from Rockband.  They stuck to Rock.  They also put out a turntable version with rap stuff and it tanked.  By the way, a TURNTABLE IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT.  At first it didn't bother me too much because I know RAP is popular, but then I realized that this game is TEACHING YOU HOW TO PLAY A REAL INSTRUMENT which is something that the RAP community seems to think is not necessary anymore.  That is my biggest problem with that whole form of art (I DO NOT call it MUSIC).  They steal riffs from other songs and talk over them.  Keep that \"\"artform\"\" out of my Rock please.\"", "\"I've had this game for about 4 months and I've worked my way through most of it, so I think that I have a pretty good feel for it.  Just like others have mentioned, the game is based off of Guitar Hero.  But instead of plastic buttons, you're playing real notes and chords on a real guitar.  And just like GH, the difficulty can change as you become more proficient.Unfortunately, the game fails in a few areas that make it necessary for you to seek outside advice.  (Is this really a failing, or just a consequence of being a video-based teaching system in which you can't ask questions or get critiqued?)  The biggest gripe I have with the game is how it changes difficulty while you're playing a song.  I don't like this because as I'm going through a song,  I'll all of a sudden come across chords that I've never seen before.  Nothing will get you more frustrated than having to stop playing because you just don't know how to do what they're asking.  I think that if the game were set up differently, like maybe coaching you through and practicing what is to come next, it would be much more enjoyable.  The game also glosses over or completely ignores some basics that would be helpful to know.  For example, it does not mention alternate picking.  So you're left thinking \"\"How am I supposed to play these notes this fast?\"\"Overall, I'd say that this is a very good accessory to learning the guitar.  Notice I said accessory.  I don't use this as my sole learning platform, and I don't suggest that you do either.  But this game can help because it's more fun than practicing fingering exercises like a teacher would have you do, and hence, it keeps your attention and motivation high.\"", "\"In an age of Guitar Heroes, Rocksmith is a true tutor. At times though, this teacher can be a little cruel by pulling out the odd trick question or two on a subject you've never studied.I would consider this to be a study aid vs. an actual game.The first warning bell went off after opening the game, the actual manual was roughly 2 pages, with all of the standard warnings and support information. Also included was a large fold-out instruction manual explaining how to properly set up your PS3 and makes the case that the game is optimized for those with an external sound system.  I do not own a surround sound system and I don't mind HDMI a/v. I like the one cable solution. In the case of Rocksmith, processing both audio and video through the same cable creates video lag, which can lead to notes not triggering correctly.I used a simple Ibanez Gio electric guitar (the type that comes with the starter packages found at most musical instrument stores). This is great because it shows you don't have to break the bank and buy a very expensive electric guitar to play.The game has a nice selection of music ranging from the classics to current favorites, and does a good job of transposing these songs to the game for a proper \"\"feel\"\". The downside is that the game introduces different playing techniques during playback and doesn't explain what the icons are until after the song is finished. During a song by The Black Keys, the game introduces hammer-ons and pull-offs and then didn't explain what they were until after the song was over. During Red Hot Chili Pepper's rendition of Stevie Wonders' Higher ground, the game introduced Palm Muting, but again didn't explain what the icons were until the song was over. This lack of information will make it hard to play the songs properly the first time around. Which leads to a lot of backtracking over the material, but then again, practice does make perfect but I found it more tedious and got sick of the available songs very quickly this way.Overall, it's not a bad package and a good way to dip your toe into the world of guitar playing. I would try this before signing up for real lessons, but nothing will replace a real teacher. For someone like me who has been playing guitar for a number of years, it's a fun little trainer to keep my technique up. The added modes that allow you to mess with the amp selection and effects pedals are fun. It actually helps me figure out a sound before I go to the music shop to buy a specific effect pedal.3 stars.\"", "\"I had so many doubts about this product. I questioned how this game was going to know which tabs/chords I was playing. I didn't know if it would actually help me learn to play any better than the countless YouTube vidoes had before. But my questions were soon answered thanks to GameStop having a good sale on the \"\"game\"\" a couple of weeks ago.I've had a guitar since 2001 and I've learned to do absolutely nothing on it. I'd practice for a couple of days, maybe even a week, and lose all interest in it until a couple of months later. I never wanted to get a teacher for help since I'm a full time employee, married, and a gamer (ie: no free time). I tried several methods online, even bought the beginner books at stores... nothing. So this game was my last hope. And so far, I've stuck with it longer than before. Am I learning anything? Maybe, maybe not, but I'm at least practicing.The game works, which blew me away. I have a friend that's the exact same way with the guitar as me, and also a gamer. I loaded Skype up so he could watch me play and so we could judge the game based on what it was advertised as. He was blown away too, buying it the next day.When you play, the game starts you out on very basic tabs. At first, I was thinking this method sucked (still blown by the fact that it recognized I was playing the right note). I soon realized that it would be pointless to throw all the notes at me since I'm still in learning mode. But basically, the game will start you off with a few notes here and there. If you're doing good, you will \"\"level up\"\" and be able to play more notes. Start sucking again, it will level you back down. I have found this method extremely helpful so far and something that really makes sense.While you play through events and practice-practice-practice, you'll unlock some mini-games that help you progress further. These are just there to help you fine tune moving between strings and frets, chords, slides, bends, and more. I've played so much of the bends and frets that I actually do feel I've improved at the gutiar a little bit.Pretty much everything works well. There's a lot of tutorial videos and mini-games/training tools that makes the $50-$80 price really well worth it if you're seriously wanting to learn. The only thing I will say that kind of stinks is that when you turn the music/crowd off, you'll notice you still suck at the guitar because you're not strumming correctly or holding the string down incorrectly. I've been working on this and I think the best thing to do to sound better is crank the music/crowd down to about 60 and leave the guitar up so you can actually hear yourself suck.One other thing I've noticed is that the game isn't perfect at picking up the notes you've played properly. For example, if you have to strum a lot, the vibrations is what it picks up (I assume) and if a string is still vibrating, sometimes it will pick it up like you played it. It's rare, but it happens.I still give this game a 5* just because it works and it's motivated me to learn the guitar after years of excuses.\"", "I've taken guitar lessons off and on for years and have never really gotten good at it, though not from lack of trying. Not only was this game immensely fun, but it improved my guitar play. No, it hasn't made me a Chris Cornell guitar god, but some of the more difficult chords have become much easier to play. What makes it really great is the ease of use. Even if you've never played a guitar or ever had an itching to try it some strumming, then this is your ticket. You build on your skill level whether your completely to guitar play or an expert. And you'll have a lot of fun doing so. I actually put off using this as a tool to help my guitar play and I'm sorry I did. What are you waiting for it?! Give it a try!", "\"I originally wanted to pick up Rocksmith when it first released, but I dropped the idea after learning that at the time it didn't have anything for learning bass guitar, which is something I've owned for a long time but never really got deep into it.  Then about halfway through August, I learned that a bass expansion was finally released, so I made a point to go and finally give this game a shot.Five days and $70 later, I'm glad I made the investment.  Rocksmith is not only a technological revolution in the way players interact with music games, but it's a revolution in learning how to play a real instrument altogether!  The game comes with a USB-to-1/4\"\" cable that allows you to plug in a real guitar or bass to your console via USB.  Unlike Rock Band 3's attempt at throwing real instruments in the game or Rise of the Six String's flawed mechanics, Rocksmith actually works, and works very well!Upon plugging your instrument in for the first time, the game asks you what style of instrument you're playing--that is, what hand you strum with, what your head-stock looks like--and even has you tune the instrument for playing with the game.  My guitar-playing cousin criticized the tuner for \"\"not tuning it properly,\"\" but I believe for the core purpose of the game it really doesn't matter because its purpose is to show you how to lay the techniques and rhythms down.Like Rock Band, the game is set up as if you're going from gig to gig performing music.  However, it's a lot deeper than that.  Rather than throwing you immediately into a gig, the game allows you to rehearse the songs until you're at least minimally good enough to play the song in front of a crowd.  Also, you can unlock new technique lessons and more through rehearsing and even playing live!Speaking of unlockables, I can tell there is a whole lotta content to be had in this game.  Since at heart it's a music game for playing music, there's an Amp mode that allows you to turn your home theater into... well, a jam space.  Here, you can customize your very own tones using an array of different pedals with a variety of effects, and amps as well.  If you feel like being impatient you can pay $5 to unlock the non-rare pedals and amps, but what's the fun in that?!At the other end of the spectrum, Rocksmith knows it's a game and definitely never shorts the player on fun.  Bored of playing gigs and learning techniques?  Then put your current skills to the test by playing a variety of mini-games--all of which involve playing with your guitar or bass.  One such game is Ducks, where you must hit the ducks with the corresponding fret and string combination until time runs out.  It's very fun and addicting--in one round, I got over 100,000 points like it was nothing!  As a bass player my favorite is the Big Swing Baseball, where your objective is to swing the bat using bass-bending techniques.  It's challenging but extremely fun!My one complaint with Rocksmith is that it may be difficult to set up for your HDTV.  They absolutely stress that you not rely on HDMI output for audio.  My suggestion is to use HDMI for Video only, then use your AV cables for direct audio output to your stereo or home theater.  Also, it's recommended that you look into Optical Audio to avoid lag altogether.  If you're like me and enjoy the mini-games, it should be a necessity.In conclusion, Rocksmith is a highly enjoyable and educational video game.  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone with even a mild interest in learning to play music.  Advanced players might find themselves confused or frustrated with the layout, but for someone like me who was already familiar with the layout of a music game it isn't too bad to adjust to.  Give it a shot!(NOTE:  If you get this before October 18th 2012, you'll have to pay $29.99 for the Bass Expansion if you wish to play bass with this game.  The bass expansion is NOT INCLUDED with the original game.)\"", "\"As a game, Rocksmith is really rough around the edges. The graphics are non-existent, crowds look lame, menu system forces you to constantly move backwards, training tools are buried and often info about a specific technique comes after a song that requires it, not before, there is no story mode and tons of loading screens. You basically just learn to play songs. If you like the song, keep working at it. If you don't move on. Nothing to it.You do unlock guitars, pedals and amps, but as an actual guitar player with real equipment, I can tell you they're pretty much worthless. The songs all have a predetermined sound...which is a necessity. The idea of dialing up your own sound on a virtual pedal board and inserting it into another song is kind of cool...I guess. But the pedals and amps aren't licensed, they're just generic OD pedals and amps. It would have been really awesome if you could actually use and modify the same gear as Robert Smith, Eric Clapton (57 Champ, no pedals) or Josh Homme (Bassman and Drop tuned guitars, Fuzz Face). Anyone whose played a lot of guitar will tell you finding your hero's tones can be nigh impossible and having an accurate (i.e. name brand listing of guitar rig) would have added a lot to the experience.The other issue I have is that Rocksmith is like learning to play using tabs. Lots of people do that, BUT you miss any theory or technique work. You also have to figure out songs. As an example, Sweet Home Alabama uses a simple chord progression starting with a D chord played with a 4,4,6,5 string plucking pattern. You don't have to move your hands and it's pretty simple IF you know how to play it right. But just having notes flying at you at full tempo makes something that is relatively easy more difficult than it has to be. When it comes to playing an instrument, there are more than enough difficult parts and you always want to keep it as easy as possible.It would have been great if there was some sort of \"\"how to\"\" for each song. It would also be nice if there were some basic chord progressions that ramped you up from an E minor to a full barre F outside of the songs. Just dropping that on a new player is pretty brutal. It would also be really cool if there was something in the game to show you what scale solos were based on, how the chord progressions worked, anything that gave you some theory to support the tabs.***Update***As a game - Rocksmith is really rough, and that is a fair assessment. It is also VERY difficult if you have zero guitar knowledge. I read an article that put it best, \"\"it's like learning to spell watching Wheel of Fortune\"\". That said, it works. I've seen immediate improvements in my speed on the neck because the game forces you out of you comfort zone with the large variety of songs and styles. Although it can be frustrating when you aren't ready for the speed of some of the songs, it really helps improve timing because it's like a full band for a metronome. It's going to keep going whether you are or not.There is a lot of room for improvement across the board, but that's not to say this isn't a really fun game. I'm already looking forward to part two. Here's to better menus, metal, funk, country and punk in the next iteration.\"", "I haven't play it as much as rock band (I'm more into the drums stuff), but I had a friends guitar at my house, so I wanted to try it out, and I was surprised on the mechanics, It works with any guitar and the hardware provided seems of good quality.It has a section with techniques, so you can focus on learning, and the more notes you play, more notes will be shown to play, until you play everything as a real player, and you'll learn how to read tablatures.", "\"I \"\"inherited\"\" this game after my dad saw it and thought he could learn guitar by playing this. He gave up after trying it once lol, but he's not really into video games. Rocksmith is pretty fun but nothing like Guitar Hero or Rock Band. You need an electric guitar to play along with the songs. The only downside is you're not going to learn how to read sheet music by playing this since they don't give real names for notes or chords. They show them as colors like red, green, blue, etc. It's also not as easy to play as it looks since you have to be able to move your fingers on the fly and know exactly where to place them. If you're not used to playing guitar you will be too slow and mess up often.I didn't like the music selection at all and I HATED the loading screens and tuning screens. There is a tuning screen before every song...was it really necessary? It's difficult to find exactly what you want to play or do, whether it's a certain song, tutorial, or practice session. They designed the game so it's basically streamlined in the order they want you to play it. You can't really skip ahead or backtrack easily without a decent menu.If they had more mainstream songs I would enjoy Rocksmith, but overall I would say this game is for the people who already know how to play some guitar or are really dedicated to learning.\"", "\"I own a Fender Washburn Stratocaster.  I threw this disc in, hooked up the guitar, and held my breath.  Would the nay-sayers of \"\"latency / too many A/V setups\"\" win out the day?The answer is a resounding NO.  I play a note and there is no noticeable delay whatsoever.  My A/V system has become my amp (and oh, what an amp with a Pioneer Elite to back it up).Rocksmith, first and foremost, is an INSTRUCTOR, not a social party.  If you're looking for social party gaming like Rock Band, look elsewhere.  Rocksmith is intended to have you learn how to play guitar, straight and simple.  The game starts off with a sound check to calibrate the volume of your guitar and, more incredibly still, to TUNE YOUR GUITAR.  And it's a surprisingly good tuner at that.Once your guitar's in tune, the game eagerly throws you into the Rolling Stone's \"\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction.\"\"\"\"What difficulty should I play?\"\" you might ask.  Ah, that's where the beauty of Rocksmith comes in.  Rocksmith will ramp the difficulty up or down depending on how well you play.  Are you nailing every single note coming down the strum highway?  Well, here come a few more!  Ooops, you're missing just about every single note?  Rocksmith will ramp it down.  There's no \"\"failing\"\" here...Rocksmith will rewards you with the points that you rightfully earn for playing notes correctly.  If you play more notes correctly, you earn more currency to unlock more portions of the game.  If not, then you're not really ready for some of the other challenges...so stop punishing yourself.  :  Rocksmith wisely uses the point system to ensure that you're ready to tackle the challenges that you're capable of taking on.And it's just not about playing songs.  Additional challenges come in the form of mini-games where you're playing notes to blow stuff up.  It's a rather unique way to get people of all ages into the throes of learning to play guitar.  I'm in my late 30s and I enjoy the variety.What if you are actually proficient and just want to play your guitar?  Well, there's an \"\"Amp\"\" mode for that, too.  Just go over there and you're able to go through a variety of tone/pedal selects and play your guitar through your A/V system to your heart's content (for 5 dollars, you can unlock everything via DLC so you don't have to play the game).Note of warning - I did mention earlier that this is no Rock Band.  It's a LONELY game-play experience.  Don't expect to invite 3-4 friends and expect to make a night of Rocksmith...it'd be about as much fun as inviting your friends over to watch you play piano.  Yeah, that doesn't work.  But, as a primer, Rocksmith succeeds in spades and is going to be having me up many nights learning how to play a guitar.Thank you, Ubisoft, for making a game that actually lets you use a real guitar.  I'm hoping that the backlash of Activisions Rhythm Game saturation won't ultimately hurt sales, but I will be a dedicated follower to come.Suggestions for Rocksmith II if it should ever happen - include bass guitar!!!Cheers - and rock on!\"", "Just picking the axe back up after years of not playing and this game is inspiring.  I haven't played much of it yet but what I've seen so far is incredible and feels like exactly the medium I've been aching for for decades.  Thank you, Ubisoft.", "\"i've been playing guitar since i was sixteen years old.  doing a little math, that means i've been playing about 22 years now.  i'm by no means an expert, but i think i can safely say i know my way around a guitar.  still, there's always room for improvement, so i was excited to give rocksmith a try.when you fire it up, you're immediately presented with options. left handed? right handing?  acoustic/electric? electric? (i'm using my yamaha acoustic/electric for rocksmith].  Once you get the basic set up completed, which includes tuning your guitar, you're ready to jump in start playing.anyone familiar with guitar hero or rockband will be happy to know rocksmith works very much the same way - a scrolling graphic prompting you to play certain notes on certain frets.  in the beginning you're maybe playing only one note every measure or two, but as you increase, you're playing more and more notes.  you earn RSP [rocksmith points] by mastering notes, note streaks, sustains, etc.  i also appreaciated there were songs by bands outside the mainstream [jarvis cocker and the xx come to mind].  i think there's a little something for everyone.the 1/4\"\" jack with a USB port on the other end is a neat gizmo and kind of genius in its simplicity.  some have noted input lag, but i didn't really notice it.rocksmith is definitely geared towards beginners, but even experienced players will have fun.  i did and do.  if you're considering picking up the guitar for the first time, whether to wow the ladies, for kicks and giggles, or to learn some face-melting solos, you'd probably be very pleased with rocksmith.\"", "Guitar Hero may have gone the way of the dinosaur (for now) but Ubi Soft has brought us a music rhythm game unlike any we've seen so far with Rocksmith.  Instead of a cheap, plastic guitar controller to hold, you're required to plug in a real electric guitar and have at it.  Yes folks, Rocksmith uses an actual guitar, and that in itself is just plain awesome.  No matter your skill level, whether you're an experienced player or someone that just wants to learn how to play for fun, Rocksmith will fit you quite nicely.  Granted sometimes the whole thing can feel a little overwhelming when you first pop it in and play, but once you get used to it, you'll actually find yourself hooked.  There's a decent selection of songs, but there could (and should) be more, but that's only a minor, personal gripe.  All in all, if you got sick and tired of the oversaturated rhythm game genre and you actually own a real axe of your own, give Rocksmith a try, you'll be plesantly surprised at what you get here.", "Very cool game.....i would recommend this game to anyone.....it not only teaches you how to tune your guitar, it also teaches you how to play songs......alot better than the guitar hero crap, or that rock band garbage.....you get to use your own guitar....instead of a piece of plastic with colored buttons......two thumbs up", "A person could easily review this disc as either a learning tutorial or a video game. I will attempt to do both. If you're just looking for fun, then immediately look elsewhere. If you aren't interested in learning how to play the guitar, then this isn't your game. But the rewards for those with patience enough to keep at this are immense.I play a lot of guitar. My friends who've been around while I experience this game are not. And that has really been helpful in ascertaining how this game strokes different folks. So let's give you an idea of what's immediately in store with this game/practice tool.The game will begin by telling you how to put the guitar on and how to hold a pick. Next it's going to walk you through tuning, which it actually does a good job of simplifying for someone who has never touched a guitar before. After this, there will be a soundcheck, which simply has you strumming the guitar to make as much noise as is possible. I like this too for new players, because it gets them comfortable with not treating the guitar like a newborn baby. And after this the game starts you out in its main game menu, from which you will eventually be able to play venues, single songs, mini games, or even select the amplifier to play the guitar any way you please and make your own effects. The menus can take a little getting used to, but are pretty similar to what you find in most music games out there.Now, your first indication that this is not going to be another Guitar Hero experience (I'm sure real guitar players had already warned you the real deal was much harder) is the fact that you're still using the PS3 remote to navigate. There's no using the guitar itself to move around within the game. And when you begin to play your first song in the game, the differences become clear rather quickly. You'll still have a highway with notes coming at you, and every indication of where you're supposed to play. But that doesn't mean this will be easy to understand. If you can imagine a guitar hero controller with over 20 buttons instead of just 4, and 6 different rows of them with 6 different strum bars, then you'll have an idea of what the game will be introducing you to.It's pretty clear that the designers tried to create this game for people who are already used to using the Rock Band/Guitar Hero highway peripherals. While it was probably a good idea in theory, it doesn't translate all that well, because you'll always have to look at the actual guitar to know where you are. There's no indicator at the bottom of the screen to show you where you are on the neck. When you pluck the wrong note however, it will tell you how you need to move to get it right; whether up a string or down a fret. Spatial awareness and string color recognition quickly become difficult to take in, often frustrating newcomers to the point of giving up altogether. And, speaking as someone who is used to simple tablature (as opposed to a colored, moving fretboard), the game's approach to play may present a steep challenge for experienced players as well. Old dog, new tricks, and all that jazz. What I do like about the playing mechanic though is its emphasis on anchor points. In other guitar games, you'll have your four fingers in the same place at all times. Here they will be moving around pretty regularly. So the game has accounted for this by highlighting four frets on the numbered highway to try and show you where the fingers you should be playing with ought to be at any given time. The dizzying movement of the highway in this regard again takes getting used to, but the highlighted anchor will help less experienced players. I feel the game would have been much better for any kind of player if it had simply stuck with something less flashy, like the Guitar Pro approach to guitar tablature.The approach to difficulty here is both a pro and a con. The better you do, the more challenge the game will give you, until you've gone from strumming one single note here and there to playing the song in its full glory. This appears to work the other way around as well; so if you're doing terrible, the game will let up on the difficulty. I could find no means of resetting it altogether though. This meant that my friends could not play on my save file and expect to do much. I had to switch to another user on the PS3, and let them all play on that save. Time consuming and something the designers could have easily corrected. And I've seen people immensely frustrated with securing that sense of accomplishment in learning a song phrase just to have the game immediately up the difficulty and throw them into very unfamiliar territory; no accompanying explanation to be found.One thing about the game's design that I absolutely loved was its friendliness to lefties. And I do mean extreme friendliness. I am left-handed, but I learned to play on my right-handed friends' guitars. This means that I never flipped the strings, and ended up being more comfortable playing upside down. One look at the game's layout had me worried that I'd be unable to play this at all (would be like trying to play lefty for a righty on Guitar Hero). Fortunately the game allowed me to invert the strings AND switch to left-handedness. A big plus for those precious few who play like I do.Slowly, the game introduces you to new playing techniques and skill-building mini-games. These are playable outside of the game's setlist, and provide the majority of fun for non-guitar players. These things do precisely what they're intended to, and they're damn good at strengthening anyone's ability to play or learn. As you get better at what the game gives you, you'll earn rewards such as new quitars and effects, for use with the amplifier menu option. This essentially turns your TV into an amplifier, and the game slowly becomes a customizable effects pedal. This is one of the highlights; especially considering the low entry cost by way of comparison to buying these things just to play guitar away from the television. And the fact that it gives you different guitars means that you'll likely get a feel for what your next guitar purchase is going to be! I cannot say enough good things about what the disc does for players outside of simply playing the songs.While this game will eventually teach anyone most everything you could learn about playing a guitar, its approach and peripherals are not what I'd call user friendly. This may simply be an unavoidable consequence of trying to appeal to any level of player; in the end, you do them all some sort of disservice. The load times are slow, the menus are off-putting, and the highway layout is not easy to keep up with. But this game WILL teach you something you didn't already know about playing guitar. And there is a fast-building library of downloadable songs in the making. Considering that this disc actually teaches you how to play the songs as well, I would say the value of Rocksmith as a learning tool outweighs what it lacks in the arena of fun for the average video gamer. I thought very seriously about giving this title 4 stars instead of 3. After all, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't using the disc for many different purposes. But when I view this from all perspectives (as my personal life has allowed me to do), I have seen this disc both draw newcomers in AND turn otherwise interested people away from the instrument with its steep and less-than-greatly explained learning curve. There are better approaches to teaching than the way the game begins its lessons, such as teaching some simple chords before throwing you into plucking individual notes on individual strings; so says my experience at least. And the game's highway build, while functional, can quickly overwhelm even experienced players like myself.Is the game worth your money if you're even slightly interested in quitar? Oh hell yes! Will it teach the instrument to those who stick with it? You bet your ass it will. But I would take a few introductory guitar lessons before taking Rocksmith on. Because this game doesn't shine when it comes to introducing people to the utmost basics of guitar, or when it comes to offering the level of easily obtained fun other video games offer up. What this game does extremely well though is strengthening overall guitar skill (mostly with the mini-games), teaching you to play full songs (slowly, but surely), and essentially making an amplifier/effects cabinet out of your television. The disc presents both extreme benefits and extreme drawbacks. I hope that more games like this end up being made. And, although I've only rated this at 3 stars, I hope that every person interested in learning guitar dips into their patience reserves, purchases this title, and eventually appreciates what the creators of this game have done for the musical world at large. Recommended!", "I think there are several aspects to this game that make it so successful.  First, the notes to play keep scrolling across the screen so you can't look at your fingers.  This forces you to learn to do the fingering real time.  Finding the right string, right fret, and moving between frets starts to become second nature.  Second, there are a number of mini challenge games that focus on a particular guitar skill through repetition, such as sliding up and down the frets.  Third, the game will reccommend what you should do next so it acts as a guide to your development.  And finally, you can play it with any electric guitar so you are learning on your own guitar.  Other games have a plastic thing with 5 colored buttons on it, a special guitar with buttons at all the frets which is still not like holding down a string, or force you to buy a specific model guitar.I personally am not that enthralled with the song selection, but that it just my personal taste.  I don't dislike the music enough to take away from the 5 star rating.Another aspect of the game that is nice is that it helps you tune the guitar with a built in tone recognition algorithm.  So you strum a string and then raise or lower the pitch based on feedback given to you through prompts.  It will then let you know when you are spot on.  And it really does an excellent job.It is a challenging game, but one you will love to work through to meet the ends of learning to play the guitar.  Based on what it actually delivers in terms of teaching you a musical instrument, it is well worth double the price.  That is how impressed I am with it."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06422498822212219, 0.10731951147317886, 0.10286447405815125, 0.10014142841100693, 0.012529149651527405, 0.019336692988872528, 0.01945766992866993, 0.051485758274793625, 0.10632935911417007, 0.0074234758503735065, 0.02401823177933693, 0.02416439726948738, 0.06991255283355713, 0.08971390873193741, 0.07613488286733627, 0.02391909435391426, 0.10102435201406479]]}
