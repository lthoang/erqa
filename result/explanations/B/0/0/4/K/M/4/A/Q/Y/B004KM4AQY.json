The color and contrast shift when my head moves a couple inches from right to left, and I could never be sure what the image really looks like.  It's especially worse when viewing a photo on a larger screen, since the corners look darker and warmer than the middle of the screen.  IPS type monitor can fix this viewing angle problem, but I couldn't afford the cost that usually runs double to triple the conventional TN monitor price.  That's why I had been using the old humongous CRT monitor that took up half of my desk.  Everybody laughed when they saw that beast.Within the last year, several makers started producing cheaper IPS monitors, using e-IPS, with the \"\"e\"\" probably stands for \"\"economy\"\".  This monitor has the same advantage as true IPS, meaning the color and contrast don't shift depending on viewing angle.  The cheap price comes with a couple of set backs, compared to true IPS:1. The wide angle isn't as wide as true IPS.  But it's still much better than TN. I can see a huge difference between the TN monitor at my office and the IPS231P monitor in this test: [...] (replace the underscore with the dot to see the page)2. The color depth isn't true 8-bit.  It's actually 6-bit that's extended to 8-bit.  While I can see all the color shades here www_lagom_nl/lcd-test/contrast.php, the gradient test www_lagom_nl/lcd-test/gradient.php shows some minor banding.If you're looking for vibrant colors, this monitor isn't it.  Vibrant color is not the same as true colors. Look around and you'll see that true colors in the real world are actually more subdued.  The problem with using an artificially vibrant monitor is that your photos look worse when you print them out or when other people view them on their screens.One overhyped feature is the colors.  While the colors are accurate, a good quality TN monitor will be just as accurate.  Some newer TN monitors actually do better.  The real advantage over the TN monitor is that the colors remain accurate when viewing angle changes, and stays accurate from one edge of the screen to the other.  The IPS231P only covers the sRGB color space, not the extended AdobeRGB color space.  This is why professional graphics editors should look for true IPS monitors.  Being an armature graphics editor, sRGB is good enough for me, mostly because everything else in my workflow use sRGB, like printers, cameras, editors and browsers.The pixel response time is slower than TN monitors, but in practice it doesn't matter much. Tests show that it's more like 15ms lag rather than the 5ms in the specification.  However, during action and sport movies, I could not see any ghosting even if I tried to look for it.  Only hard-core gamers need to worry about this.Another thing that doesn't matter much, and yet attracted most of the complaints is the light leaks in the corners due to the new LED lighting.  The leaks are very faint, and only visible when the entire screen is completely black.While lacking HDMI port, this monitor supports HDCP encryption via its DVI port, so that you can still watch blu-ray on your computer.  There's a cheap DVI to HDMI converter that you can buy if necessary.You should also look at these competing models: Asus ML239H, NEC EA232WMi, Dell U2312HM.  They have about the same graphics quality, with differences mainly in the features.  The Dell and Asus have better pixel response time and have HDMI port, but the Dell is more expensive, and the Asus doesn't have adjustable height.  The NEC adds 4 USB ports and costs more.The bottom line is that this monitor is much better than the conventional TN type, but can't match true high-end IPS type.  The affordable price compared to true IPS type is what makes it attractive.-- Update May 22nd 2012 --I understand now why people think the color from this monitor is more vibrant.  It's because of the deeper black.  It makes colors look more saturated and also increases the contrast.  In other words, cheaper TN-type monitors don't have enough black, which make darker colors look pale.The built-in speakers sound worse than those on my laptop.  It makes movies hard to understand. Only good enough for software beeps and dings. If you watch movies or hear music from your computer at all, you'll need real speakers.I measured power usage with a Kill-A-Watt device.  The monitor only consumes 20 watts on the lowest brightness (which is still a little too bright for my dark room).\"", "Excellent monitor. I am using it right now. Good colors, good brightness, wide viewing angle. 1080 video looks relatively sharp in full screen mode. Text a little strange at non-native resolution, but that could be my video card or driver's fault. I am happy so far. Hope that the one that replaces it is as good. If you find it somewhere as New Old Stock it is still a good buy.", "\"Ok, this review is being done by a non-techy person.  I don't know what IPS, TN, or several other things are that others have mentioned.  What I do know is what works well for my nearly 60-year-old eyes.I've used this monitor with two, seperate computers.  A Windows Vista desktop and a Windows 7 Laptop.  The monitor I had been using with the desktop was a 19\"\" widescreen while the laptop has a 17\"\" widescreen.  Both computers have upgraded graphics cards.  To be on the safe side, I installed the driver and software on the Vista computer while I let the Windows 7 find the driver for me.  Setup was fast and simple both ways.What I like about the LG IPS231P-BN 23\"\" is, well, everything.  Text, images, and graphics are sharp and text is very crisp, colors are true and brightness great.  Brightness, contrast, etc, are easy adjustments but I didn't find the need to adjust them.My primary uses for my computers and monitors are web surfing, business applications, virtual-reality communities, photo editing, and to a more minor extent some website design and building.When it comes to photo editing and graphics and images for websites I'm very picky about details.  I'll often blow up the image or graphic to edit at the pixel level.  The LG is a real god-send.  Although I can blow up the images on both my laptop and desktop to the same level I was getting a lot of eye strain and headaches.  Not once did I have a headache or feeling of eyestrain when using the LG. I don't know what technology goes into it to make it so great, but great it is.One other feature I especially liked was the adjustable height.  Height adjustment is easy and has a range that makes it perfect for any situation.  The swivel is also nice when I turn the monitor to demonstrate my work or get input from co-workers.The built-in speakers are just ok.  If you're in the middle of a room they sound pretty tinny.  If the monitor is close to a wall the sound does improve.  However, if you are used to hearing sound through a good set of computer speakers with a sub-woofer you'll want to continue to use them.  Little speakers can rarely compare to their larger counter-parts.I'm very tempted to purchase another one of these so I can have one for both computers.  The price is good and LG quality is superb.  I don't think you could go wrong with one of these.\"", "Just when I thought a 19-inch was huge, here comes the LG IPS231P-BN 23-Inch Widescreen LED LCD Pivoting Monitor with IPS Panel. I have owned my 19-inch wide screen for a few years now and switching to a 23-inch just wowed me to no end, it so much enhances the viewing pleasure you get from your computer.Taking this out of the box and installing it was a no brainer. My conventional desktop with VGA outputs was an easy set up. I'm running on a Windows 7 and it needs no further software modification. My system instantly recognized the LG monitor. It does come with a software cd to guide you if a problem do arise but rest assured it will work if you are running on Windows 7. The 5M:1 contrast ratio is just plain amazing! Everything you look at is just amplified to an extreme sharpness. The resolution was perfect in every sense. Factory configurations worked alright for me but a little tweaking on the settings made it much more desirable. I can now watch regular DVD's in near HD despite the fact that my optical drive is neither Hi-Def nor Blu-ray. Watching movies online also reproduces the same results. It is just sharp and makes you appreciate watching it on this monitor compared to watching it on your TV.The Pivoting function puts the icing on the cake on the versatility of this monitor. You can move it to your desired angle and suit your viewing pleasure. Extremely happy with this monitor. Makes you appreciate your pc more! LG is fast catching up with a superb reputation as far as consumer electronics and appliances are concerned. They manufacture stuff from cellphones to washing machines. And they are priced considerably lower than the leading brands but make no mistake that LG makes quality electronics and this opinion is backed up with the way I felt about this monitor. Highly recommended!", "\"I was so excited to get this monitor, it only has DVI and VGA inputs but a few months back I purchased a $7 converter plug to change HDMI to DVI and hooked my PS3 up to this amazing HD Screen. Blu-Ray looks breath taking on it, the games are just as good. The monitor hooked right up and took full advantage of the PS3 and adjusted right up.I purchased an 19\"\" Compaq monitor during Black Friday and was very disappointed in the viewing range, This monitor rocks no matter where i'm sitting in my room the screen has an amazing brightness and clarity. I have not hooked it up to my Mac yet because i have another monitor for that, but if you are a gamer or movie fanatic this will fit the bill beautifully.\"", "I have a Mac, and it didn't come with a connector for the Mac, so I simply had to by an adapter. When I originally hooked it up to the Mac, the color was bad, could not match it up to my Mac. Not knowing what was causing it, I hooked it up to my Windows laptop, and the color on the two monitors matched up. I re hooked it up to my Mac, and now the colors between the monitor and my Mac match up. I don't know if the connections where simply not in tightly or what, but it works great.It is very easy to hook up. It does come with a disk, if the monitor is not recognizing your computer or your computer doesn't recognize the monitor, but I simply had to plug it in and was ready to go. It is very light weight. You can raise it and lower it on the stand, and it tilts up and down, and side to side. I gave it 4 stars because since I had to buy the adapter to connect it to my Mac.", "I too have a MacBook similar to a previous reviewer and I had the connector needed for proper demo capabilities.  Also, unlike this other Mac demo my demo did indeed give me perfect color clarity, and I believe it was because the adapter was fully plugged into the laptop.  If you do not secure the plug then you run the risk of a lost or garbled signal and then you end up with poor video, hence the issues.It is very easy to hook up and it does come with an install CD if you have issues or need assistance.  Also for further clarification, this model I demoed did not have an HDMI port.  The box listed it as having a port but there was no port that I could find and I looked over the entire screen for at least 10 minutes.  The other issue is the internal speaker.  I too thought it would be a nice addition and removed my external speakers but I was not impressed with the lack of depth and quality of sound coming from the screen.  The first generation iPads have better sound out of their screens.The tilt and rotate function is a really nice feature and it offers standard modes from Movie to RGB and custom.  With the screen being so lightweight you can easily adjust the screen to any angle or rotate for a vertical or horizontal screen.  The colors were perfect and the setup buttons were very easy to utilize and really assisted in the setup of the monitor, just be careful of the cords when adjusting.  I suggest unplugging everything, adjusting and then plugging everythign back together.  Also, I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referring to when they talked of the halo problem.  My monitor never had that issue whether it was left on or turned off and on several times, along with getting unplugged and plugged back in.I really like LG products and would love to be able to demo more of such items.  I feel the company stands behind the quality of the brand and goes the distance in producing well made products and backing them with great customer service.Overall - 4 stars.  Had the internal speakers been of better quality I would have been able to give this monitor 5 stars.  With that being said, simply don't use the speakers and enjoy the high quality screen!", "When it comes to electronics and certain products I like to wait a while before offering up my review just to make sure I've shaken out as many of the gremlins as I can during regular use. I've had this monitor for just shy of a year and I am actually surprised there weren't *more* gremlins with it.Upon unpacking it, there was a tiny bit of assembly required (securing the monitor to the base), but it's nothing that requires an instruction manual--though there is one--and once you've done that and plugged it in, it's ready to go. In fact, I was a bit astonished at how close to plug and play this monitor was when I hooked it up. I tested it with 4 different computers and I only needed to tweak the monitor settings on one.As far as the colour composition, I found that it was too cool and had to do some colour calibration, though I don't think this would be a problem for the average home user. One of the first things I did after getting the monitor set up to my liking was load in an HD video. The image quality was stunning, with vivid crisp colours and I didn't notice any serious problems with pixelation or bleed, even in the dark/black sections.One of the next things I did was load in a PDF document (black text on white background) and again I was impressed with its crispness. The contrast of text was beautiful, even when using maginification tools. A problem I encountered, however, was with the swiveling of the minitor from landscape to portrait for easier document reading. Unfortunately, the monitor doesn't automatically detect this change and you'll need to manually make the switch in your computer's settings. To me, this is a pretty big failing and was worth of knocking off half a star.The other half comes off with the adjusting of the monitor. Although you can swivel the monitor forward and back to get specific angles, I've found that sometimes it has a mind of its own and wants to bounce back slightly to its previous position. So once you have the monitor at the angle you like, you'll want to try very hard not to bump it out of place. It's a minor annoyance, but it is an annoyance.On a day to day, I'm mainly creating digital art and crafting websites and this monitor has been a joy to work with. It has a matte finish so it doesn't glare even in direct light and it's been much easier on my eyes than my previous glossy screen. When I log off the computer I don't need to worry about shutting off the monitor because it automatically goes into power-saving mode, which cuts down considerably on warm up time when rebooting the computer.And I've been watching for the dreaded dead pixel which seems to crop up after 6 months of use with some monitors and I can happily report (knock wood) that I've not had a single dead pixel or other serious problem with this monitor since I've been using it. Overall, it's well crafted, easy to use and provides a beautiful picture with minimal fiddling with the settings.", "\"This monitor is decent.  It has the ability to pivot the monitor so that it be comes portrait and you can use the monitor like a full size document.  The clarity is nice.  Very clean.  Bright and it's adjustable up and down.  It offers that standard modes from movie to RGB and custom.  Great for adjusting what you want and how you want to watch it.  Movie, games, or however you would like to change.It has a port for HDMI.  I am going to try hooking up my PS3 to it and test the performance on that.Now for the not so good.  When the display is completely black, there is this weird halo at the top going down into the monitor, almost like a glow.  Well, this completely renders the monitor useless if you are doing graphics and using black as a part of your graphic.  It ends up looking like shades of gray.Next thing that I don't like is that the \"\"invisible\"\" speaker is quite useless.  I've yet to hear a decent integrated monitor speaker.  I was excited because I could dismantle my desktop speakers.  Well, after hearing the speakers inside, I decided to hook them up again.  Bummer.Overall, the size is nice, picture is great when there is color and the screen doesn't have a dark or full black screen.  If it weren't for the terrible sounding speaker, or the halo display, I'd give it a higher rating.  The halo wash of white is really irritating to me, I originally gave this monitor a 3 star, but degraded it to a 2 because watching movies on this monitor doesn't do the movie justice.  Especially when the movie has a dark background.\"", "The LG 23-Inch Widescreen LED LCD Pivoting Monitor has a fantastic picture. It comes out nice and crisp and clear. The first thing I tried hooking up to it is my laptop computer to be able to watch online shows on a bigger screen. It was super easy to hook up. I used the included VGA cord and the included cord to hook up the sound. I was really amazed by the picture, but the sound was barely there. I went in to the set up menu on the monitor, by pressing the buttons on the monitor itself and found the volume and turned it up all the way. I also turned up the volume all the way on my laptop and the sound was still horrible. You could hear it, but there wasn't much there and sounded like it was coming through a tin can 50 miles away. So the built in speaker is useless. I unplugged the cord and just used the speakers on my laptop as they were 1000 times better than the sound I was getting through the monitor. The next thing I wanted to hook up, and the biggest reason I wanted this monitor, was our Xbox 360. You can not hook it up with the included cords. You need to spend around another 10-12 dollars on special cords to hook the xbox up to this monitor and to be able to attach external speakers for the sound. After I purchased what I need and hooked it up all I can say is WOW! I love it. It's nice to get my living room television back and have a dedicated monitor for the gaming system. So while the picture on the monitor is fantastic, the built in speaker is useless. Just do a little online research if you want to hook up a gaming system to the monitor and you'll find out what you need. I would love to get another one for our other gaming system in the house."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0008413882460445166, 0.25977176427841187, 0.21589967608451843, 0.28338420391082764, 0.003718211315572262, 0.23106276988983154, 0.0014083334244787693, 0.0028926352970302105, 0.0009294880437664688, 9.148765093414113e-05]]}
