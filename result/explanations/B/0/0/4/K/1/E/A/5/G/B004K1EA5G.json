The 3d aspect is a good touch, the cinematic scenes of the story mode and the backgrounds of the fighting areas look gorgeous (and for the guy fans out there, the JIGGLE effect of your favorite female fighter is great in 3d). while it seems to slow the action down, it is not detract that it gives you the feel of actually seeing the area (if you go online and are trying to find someone move your 3ds around, the scene moves with you like you are looking through the eyes of a character.  this game is quick to learn, just pick up and go with the moves list below to reference or push on the touch screen.  also it has a streetpass mode like street fighter which give you some fun even when your system is in sleep mode.the cons of the game is as others said, the english dub is not great, the voices are rich but the movement is not there, the online is glitchy (but probably can be fixed in an update, but it could be a lag difference of where you are playing and the speed of your opponents wireless)but still good, and the ladder could have been better, but it is a good way to learn the game before jumping into online fights (and get a few outfits and characters).  the only thing about the combo list is that it is so large, while you can press the combo you want you do need to move fast to hit them in a fight.UPDATE:  Download 2 started up - I have two costumes for Kokoro and Akane - I hope they bring more out, and I wonder when Samus will be available to play with (and I wonder if they are going to give her the swimsuit outfit you get if when you beat Metroid in under 5 hours :-) )overall i give the game a very good grade, especially if you killed SUPER STF IV and are waiting for Zelda and Resident Evil.", "This game happens to be the epitome of the 3ds right now in my opinion...It has free dlc daily,ghost fighters w/special prizes (figurines) weekly, online battles, beautiful graphics, responsive controls and even good music.Tecmo didn't sacrifice anything putting this on nintendos system...The only complaint I have (which I'm sure you will have heard) is the sometimes psuedo static cutscenes and, the dip to 30fps while the 3d is on...Oh, well this game is fantastic and really feels like a console version of the series... The 3d effect is pronounced and I actually prefer it on...It gives the tiered interactive stages great depth and also makes the battles a little bit more tolerable in the pacing of the match. (since the speed is so blazingly fast when the 3d is off.)This game uses the gyroscope and mic for the game in unexpected ways...(get to the metroid stage and blow...)And the story mode serves as a nice tutorial as well as, compounding the story of the series together. (although DOA has had a non-sensical story for most of the characters.) Overall this is a must have for fighting fans or, for anyone with a 3ds complaining about the dearth of games right now...I give it a 9/10...", "Being a fan of Dead or Alive since the very beginning, I've followed the franchise, faithfully, with each installment. Dead or Alive Dimensions is one installment I've looked forward to with alot of anticipation simply because it is the first handheld Dead or Alive game(fighting DoA game) to grace a Nintendo console. I was expecting DoAD to be dumbed down to make it onto the system but I'm quite surpised that everything I know and love the series for is there. Deep technical fighting? Check. Gorgeous visuals? Check. Online gameplay? Check. Lots of play modes? Check. Extras? Check. Do I recommend the game to all 3DS owners out there? You better believe it.In my opinion, this has to be the best fighter on the Nintendo 3DS, thus far. Even toppling out Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition(And, honestly, I love both franchises). Seeing as to how the 3DS is the system for fighters, I hope we see Tekken, Soul Calibur and older favorites like Power Stone, Rival Schools, Star Gladiator and Bloody Roar.", "As a fan of DOA since it's debut in 1996 on the ps1 i have purchased and played every DOA title all the way to DOA 4 on the 360, including the two volleyball games, so i was super excited when i heard that DOA:D was coming soon to my recently purchased 3ds having been waiting for about 5 years for DOA 5.This title in the series is excellent and any worries i might have had about playing this on a handheld have vanished.  This game is as beautiful graphically as it's 360 cousin and the sound/music is also top notch.  The controls, for me at least, are smooth and tight and very responsive to my movements.  It's great to see the DOA characters again alongside my favorites like Kasumi and Jann-Lee and i have not unlocked everything yet but from what i can see this title may have every DOA character included in this version.I started with the chronlogical mode that serves as both a tutorial and looks to wrap up the previous DOA stories and i'm guessing will go into the new one dimensions but i have only played to doa 3 atm, it was really nostalgic seing all those old bosses, costumes and seeing those old storylines i havent seen for 5-10 years and i have not even touched arcade or any other mode yet, and with so much content to unlock like characters, costumes and figurines i can see myself playing this game for a LONG time to come.This is so far one of the best 3ds titles available and gave me a reason to turn on my 3ds again and to keep it on for the coming weeks if not months.  If you're on the fence i say it's defintely worth your money and time, just buy it now and support temco on their 3ds games and who knows maybe they will even bring ninja gaiden to the 3ds if this does well enough", "\"The Nintendo 3DS is very much still in its infancy but just within its first 3 months in the US market, the platform has already hosted a few high profile fighting game appearances. Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition, BlazBlue: Continuum Shift 2 3D, and this one, Dead or Alive Dimensions. Both BlazBlue & DoA make their Nintendo debuts. With the power of the 3DS system and its unique ability to display stereoscopic 3D glasses free, 3rd party developers are approaching Nintendo's newest portable with open arms and giving the system the type of games that have never been seen on a Nintendo portable. I personally find it to be a golden age as I'm finally getting to play more \"\"hardcore\"\" games on a console with Nintendo's franchises side by side.For its first foray on to a Nintendo console, Dead or Alive Dimensions takes the series' trademark frantically fast and frenetic fighting gameplay on to the palm of your hands with a title that serves as your passport to DoA's world. Dimensions is not a sequel but rather an encyclopedic entry that explores the stories and events of the first four DoA games. A total of 26 combatants are playable in this installment making it the largest cast in the series' history. For the first time, all boss characters from 1-4 are playable. Though its obvious that a few concessions had to be made especially with regards to Nicole from part 4 as she is Halo inspired, Dimensions is still your guide pass to the DoA universe.Dimensions did some things a little different to its impressive roster of single player modes. For example, Arcade Mode is really more of a time attack mode where you pick a course with a predetermined set of opponents on a race to beat the best time. There is no story mode for every character, instead, you get a mode called Chronicle which is the game's main single player campaign. Chronicle tells the stories of the four Dead or Alive Tournaments through various cut scenes, dialogue sequences, and cinematics. As crazy as the characters and their situations are, the story is told rather poorly and comically which will lead to more questions than answers. The voice acting is pretty cheesy but some of the action sequences are pretty awesome (love the scene where Hayate kills a bunch of DOATEC soldiers, lots of blood and gore hehe). If anything, Chronicle is perfect for DoA newbies as it also explains the gameplay mechanics from performing basic combos, executing the franchises' famous counter system, and using environments to your advantage.Translating the gameplay from console to portable is spot on here. The controls are easy to learn, you have four main buttons, one for punch, kick, guard, and throw. Combinations of buttons are very rare here, just more on manipulating your body in tandem with the four main buttons. Though DoA is not as fleshed out as say Tekken or Virtua Fighter, DoA's real hook is on how you can master the counter system. The vast majority of moves a fighter has in this game can be countered in a display of lighting quick reflexes. Holding the guard button in sequence with a directional pad is all it takes to perform the counter. The trick to it however is guessing whether the landing hit is a high, low, or medium. The hardest CPU levels have a high frequency of guessing your moves in turn with the CPU performing a devastating counter and performing the more challenging combo moves. Another feature of the DoA franchises are its great stage designs. You won't find any bland plain stages a la Tekken/Soul Calibur here. The highlight as always are the multi-tiered stages where you can push off enemies from higher ground to a ravine below. Environmental traps such as electric walls and a special stage taken from Metroid Other M has the menacing Ridley shooting fireballs at the combatants and will do serious damage to any fighter who happens to fall out of the ring.With 26 playable characters, you'll find many favorite characters to use in DoA Dimensions. Characters specializing in ninjutsu are more of your ninja type characters such as Kasumi, Ayane, Ryu, and Hayate, quick and agile they strike at a more rapid rate. Gen Fu, Leifang, Eliot, and Jann Lee are more of your traditional Chinese martial arts fighters, not as fast as the ninjutsu characters but have more concentrated strikes. For expert grapplers, Tina, Bass, and La Mariposa are experts at grappling combos which are very strong attacks. As noted you can play all the boss characters so you can finally pull off some of their most frightening moves. Each character has an insane amount of moves to perform. Just like in Super Street Fighter IV 3D, you can use the touch pad of the 3DS to use a move. Though its not as useful as SSFIV's, you'll probably use the touch pad trying to frantically activate a counter move instead.The graphics in Dimensions are quite stunning. The 3D effect adds a deep sense of immersion but the framerate runs at half speed as opposed to switching the 3D off. Some claim 30 frames is pretty unplayable, I leave the 3D effect on as I bought the 3DS for its cool 3D features. The stages are mostly taken from DoA 3&4 and have been translated quite well. There is still quite a lot of sex appeal here with the lady characters but the jiggly breasts from previous titles have been toned down a bit, so sorry, if you were expecting jello boobs in 3D, they're more realistic here. Character models retain their look quite well with a daily dose of free DLC content for costumes. I've had this game since day one and every day I get a new costume to use. Load times are non-existent. I haven't played much online but the game is pretty laggy online. You will need another copy of the game to play with 2 3DS systems offline.Dead or Alive Dimensions is my favorite game on the 3DS so far (Ocarina of Time 3D a very close second). This is a game full of content even if you're content on playing the game solo 99% of the time. With the fun, fast, gameplay, rich graphics, daily free DLC, this shall remain my favorite fighting game on the system. It will be for you as well, I guarantee.\"", "Dead or Alive Dimensionsis a great game and probably my favorite for the3DSso far. The gameplay and story of this game is amazing and much better thanSuper Street Fighter IV, which I also purchased.Story: The story was decent overall, but it was a little confusing. For a newcomer like me, the text that they had on the touch screen was very helpful. It described everything that I wouldn't normally know from just watching the clip scenes. I admit that I had to go online websites for a better comprehension of the story, but people who played the past DOA games wouldn't be as confused as me. The characters are very unique, and the end-of-the-chapter clip scenes look amazing, especially the ending to chapter 5. The other clip scenes, however, look kinda bland. The Chronicle Mode lasted for four hours for me, which was shorter than I expected. In my opinion, I think this was more like a tutorial mode because they were teaching the basics in every chapter.Gameplay: Simply amazing. It was challenging yet fun to try again over and over again. The complexity is much higher than any other fighting game I've played, and I enjoyed the immersion with the 3D environment. The touch screen provides a list of attacks along with their button commands. Beginners could press the move they want to use, or they could use the list to help them do the moves themselves and master it. There are plenty of characters to play as, and each one is fun to play as.Overall: The game is great, and it has many features. I highly recommend it to fighting game fans and people who have a small library of 3DS games. Personally, my favorite fighter is Tengu and my favorite stage is Geothermal Power Plant.", "Don't let the fact that this is a portable persuade you from trying it. DOA is recreated in 3D and it makes a fantastic difference. You will notice a little loss in detail from the console versions but it's still great on the eyes. It's just amazing what they can do with portables now. A must have in the collection if your into the series. And as far as I know, the only version of Dead or Alive that is made in 3D.", "\"I'm a longtime fan of the DoA franchise, due to the inherent tongue-in-cheek humor and lighting fast bouts signature to the series. When it was announced that the game would be brought to the 3DS, I was beside myself with excitement. After all, the only other fighters announced for the system were \"\"Super Street Fighter IV\"\" and \"\"Blazblue Continuum Shift II\"\", and both of those operate on 2D planes. This was the only 3D fighter slated for Nintendo's fledgling handheld, and at the time of this writing, it still is. Being a fighting game nerd, this made it one of THE games to have for my otherwise stale 3DS. Now that I have it, though, my excitement is all at once quelled and killed. \"\"Dead or Alive Dimensions\"\" might as well be called \"\"Dead or Alive Light\"\", because it seriously skimps on many of the things that won over fans in the first place.The arcade mode feels dumbed down immensely, now operating on a ladder system unlike any other entry in the series. You start off with a series of bouts, which you can probably clear in under two minutes by simply mashing buttons. That unlocks another, along with a new character, followed by another and another. Rinse and repeat, with each ladder getting progressively more difficult, and you have the core foundation upon which you unlock characters and extra content. For fans who loved the challenge of unlocking characters and costumes in DoA 2-4, this is kind of a slap in the face. Granted, it's somewhat necessary, because you start off with a pathetic amount of characters unlocked in the first place, which brings to mind the question why Team Ninja didn't just start with more characters and make arcade mode a standard, more challenging affair. Overall, it's a nice little mode, but frustrating to start out with compared to past entries. The wealth of other modes, however, such as survival mode, fare much better and make the experience much richer than it would've been with only story and arcade mode.Most of the thought in the game, though, seems to have been spent on Chronicles, which is the game's story mode. This may actually be the best aspect of the game, if not the best story mode in the franchise. While it doesn't house the deepest story, it does keep in line with the series chronology, telling a large overarching plot different from the snippets of personal narratives seen in the previous games. I like this model, even though it's been done before by other games, and think that it suits the franchise well. Hopefully this is something that the developer will do in future entries.The most important part of a fighting game, of course, is the fighting, and this is one area where the game does not falter. Dual-button combat is the name of the game here, as it has always been for the games, and it works perfectly. Combos are displayed on the lower screen, so gone are the days of pouring over the pause screen for move memorization. Series staples such as juggling and countering have all made the transition smoothly as well. In short, if you're familiar with the series, you'll feel right at home; if not, the game is very easy to get the hang of.Graphically, the game is gorgeous. The backgrounds are much more detailed and fluid than those seen in \"\"Super Street Fighter IV\"\", and the characters move with the style and grace they always have. Every ripple of muscle on the men, and jiggle of the mammary gland on the women, are rendered with close attention to detail. Sadly, turning on the the 3D effects makes everything look noticeably worse, even slowing down the game. It's sad, because the actual illusion of the 3D is fantastic in this game, looking best during the cutscenes within the story mode.Audio in this game is great, especially the stage and menu music. Everything serves it's purpose of getting you in the mood to pummel kick some polygonal butt, maintaining fast tempos and making liberal use of guitars and synthesizers. However, the English voice acting is positively cringe-inducing, and should scare you into changing the spoken language into Japanese, stat.On the online front, things aren't as pretty. I have a very fast WiFi connection in my house, but trying to fight was a laggy pain in the rear. If this changes, I'll update the review, but insofar, fighting online is a bit irritating and could've used some more fine-tuning, what with it's vanilla layout and laggy fights.Little bonus features wrap up \"\"Dimensions\"\" into a neat little package, like it's StreetPass functionality, the ability to take 3D pictures of your battles, and collecting figurines of all the characters. While not particularly deep in the least, it's nice to know that Team Ninja didn't just slap together some modes and release the thing. Some definite effort went into making this a rich experience, and it certainly shows.\"\"Dead or Alive Dimensions\"\" is home to what fans have always kept coming back to Team Ninja for, and throws a few new curveballs at the player that mostly work. With it's improved story mode, great gameplay and fantastic graphics, this is a worthy buy for those looking to play something new on their 3DS before the storm of summer games hits, and a must-buy for fighting fans. \"\"Dead or Alive Dimensions\"\" will be getting a good amount of my attention in the coming months, and it deserves yours as well.Gameplay: A-Graphics: B+Music: B+Sound: C+ (English), B (Japanese)Overall: B+UPDATE (day after): I'm becoming closer to saying this is one of the better handheld fighters I've ever played. The story mode gets very in-depth, and hitting the higher levels of the arcade ladder gets you all of the characters you need to have a diverse selection. While the arcade ladder is a bit too short for my tastes, it turned out to be a nice mode that wasn't worthy of my initial scorn. The only other handheld 3D fighter I've played that rivals this would be \"\"Tekken: Dark Resurrection\"\", but this actually offers more in terms of what you can do. If you have a 3DS, you should probably get this.FINAL UPDATE: Okay, it's settled. This is a fantastic game. After playing a ton of non-laggy matches, sinking more time into the story mode, and becoming addicted to unlocking figurines, as well as making friends and perfecting strategies in the various modes, I must say that this is the best handheld fighter I've put my hands on. My initial review was four stars, but this game has staying power on a system where great games are seemingly few and far in between. Thus, my score is raised to a five. If you have a 3DS, this is perhaps the most in terms of content you'll able to get for a while.\"", "Ok, so the competition is basically this and Street Fighter, but DOA is absolutely the one to get. First, it's gorgeous- 60fps, fluid...it looks like a next gen portable game, whereas SF could almost pass as a PSP game. My only gripes are that the 3d mode is only worth turning on during the cutscenes...during gameplay, it ruins that smooth 60fps and knocks it down to sub 30fps, then around a hideous 15fps during the win poses- really mars the appearance of the game. But during the Chronicle Mode cutscenes, it adds a nice effect. The tiny D pad of the 3ds is kind of a problem for fighting games in general, but DOA does the best it can with it. There is a ton of content, unlockables, and modes- Throwdowns being an interesting one. As I understand it, they are weekly fights Tecmo sends you to unlock things like costumes- I've only participated in one so far, so am not 100% sure how it works. So, if you're a 3ds owner looking for a fighter, skip Street Fighter and get this instead- it's the best on the system at the moment.", "\"I usually pass on fighting games, I don't even like Mortal Kombat. The only one I ever liked was Tekken. But I found myself at an after Christmas sale that offered the \"\"buy 2 and get 1 free\"\" deals. 2 problems: the free game has to be of equal or lesser value of the CHEAPEST game you bought, and this one was the only one that was cheaper then the cheapest game I bought (besides a few games I either already had, or ones that I know that I wouldn't like. Not to pass on a good deal thinking that I could at least sell it if I didn't like it, I decided to try it out a couple of days later. I am glad I did too, it plays like Tekken and looks really amazing. It is one of the funnest games I played on the 3ds in a long time. But, I gave it 4 stars because I am still having a hard time giving a fighting game a perfect score.\"", "\"Dead or Alive Dimensions is one of those games which made me worried before I bought it. In the videos it didn't look too fun. The moves and throws did not seems to carry the needed punch and power that you see in Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat games. But eventually I gave in and bought the game. I thought it was at least worth a try given the positive reviews.I was not disappointed when I received Dead or Alive Dimensions in the mail. First let me comment what makes this game a \"\"win\"\". All the characters are fully 3d models who fight surrounded by fully rendered 3d background. It looks on par with the powerful consoles. From the start you are given the choice of most of the characters available in the game. They range from sort of tiny girl characters to large monsters, from old men to large pro wrestlers. Also if you enjoy the type of game where the characters are scantily clad and show a lot of skin, this may be eat. It is not too explicit though.Basically there are many to choose from for anyone's taste.  When you start playing you can  see the bottom screen that shows you all the move input combinations. This is very convenient because there is no way you can learn all the moves on your own. The number of unique moves per character is many more than those in Street Fighter games, which creates good depth in the game. You can choose just to learn a few moves from each character or learn all the sophisticated moves of only one character. Great way to learn and keep replaying.The fighting system is a breath of fresh air if you're tired with the other fighting games. You are gradually explained within the game what each kind of move or maneuver does. There are various throws and a method to block the throws, and all such stuff.Despite the positive aspects of the game above there are some annoyances as well. If you start playing either the arcade mode or the story mode from the start you'll see that battles end extremely quickly. You could perform about 5 powerful moves and the opponent is down. Especially if you're experienced with fighting games it will seem too easy to win. What should be done from the start is the user should select a higher difficulty setting and check all the available game options. It will make the game much better. For example change the handicap and number of rounds to at least three.Another surprisingly annoying feature is the 3DS' 3D feature. Yes the 3D can look very good, but when 3D is turned on the game runs at almost half fewer frames than it does if the 3D slider is set to OFF. When the 3D is off the game runs extremely smoothly. I'd say the 3D feature is pointless since it makes things worse.The plot of Dead or Alive Dimensions leaves to be desired and pretty much a joke. If you played any of the Japanese fighting games then you already know the plot of the game. Someone sets up a tournament, someone lies to their friend, possession by demons. Most of the cutscenes are not actual rendered cut scenes but the characters frozen in time with a bubble appearing next to them. Whether intentionally or not, some conversations are very funny.So, overall this is an excellent game which fails to use the 3DS 3D feature well.\"", "I wasn't expecting to enjoy this game quite as much as I have been. This game comes with a decent diversity of game modes. Unlike other games in the series, this entry is clearly geared toward welcoming new players into the fold. To that effect, a surprisingly lengthy 'campaign' mode introduces you both to the stories from previous games as well as to the controls, giving you advice on various moves and strategies. The 'story' in this is nigh-incomprehensible at points, but what is important is how it allows new players to become acquainted with the DOA universe.The gameplay itself is, as always with DOA, fantastic. Eschewing the combo-heavy action of games like Street Fighter, DOA: Dimensions is more tactical and might be likened to a complex game of rock, paper, scissors. You can, of course, get through quite a number of fights without any kind of discernible strategy, just punching and kicking stupidly, but you'll get creamed if you attempt this in some of the game's harder modes and difficulties.There are various modes on display, such as tag battles, survival battles, and more classic arcade-style assortments of enemies. This title also sports a fluid and workable (if somewhat restricting) online battle system. I suppose I should mention the showcase mode as well, which allows you to take 3D photos of figurines of the various fighters that you win through completing challenges, but most people won't spend much time on this aspect of the game.Control-wise, I am fairly impressed with what is on offer here. The circle pad and various buttons allows for fluid fighting, but there are also touch-screen buttons that allows the player to execute various commands automatically. I personally have no use for this control style, as, even though I kind of suck at fighting games, I still like the jerks and jabs associated with moving an analog stick around and pushing physical buttons. It is nice, though, for people who aren't accustomed to the fighter genre and might have difficulties with the default control style.The number of unlockables in this title is fantastic. Besides the large number of figurines, there are quite a few unlockable characters. The true star of this game, however, is the large number of costumes you can unlock for virtually every character. Many of the characters have 3 or 4 costumes that can be unlocked through completing various in-game achievements, and then have 3 or 4 more costumes that can be downloaded (more on that in a moment). This leads to a variety of looks you can provide for almost any given character.The downloadable aspect of this title is simply awesome. Every day, according to certain release schedules (re-releases of the same costume information are continuing into 2012, which is good for newcomers and bad, I suppose, for early adopters), new downloadable costumes are being released for various characters. Once a week there are special 'throw-down' battles that can be downloaded onto your 3DS. Some of these battles are surprisingly tough, and they can help build your ranking for online battles. The information is automatically downloaded when you turn on your 3DS' wireless capability and close it so that it goes to spotpass. If the information downloads successfully, a little dot appears on the avatar for the game when you're in the main menu, and when you start the game, directly after the title screen, a notification will pop up letting you know what was downloaded. Very useful, and these constant digital releases help keep the game in my 3DS and thus also lead to me playing it more often (almost every day).The graphics themselves, in 2D, are fairly impressive. It looks better than every game that came before DOA:4. Cutscenes are unimpressive, however, as they aren't full motion.Also worth noting is that the language options for this title can be customized. I switch between the Japanese and English language options quite a bit.This review wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention the fanservice/cheesecake factor that is prevalent in this series, and especially in this game. This series became (in)famous partially due to the attention the programmers payed to the breast movements of the female fighters. The breasts are floppy and fluid to the extent that they seem to obey their own set of physics in the battles and elsewhere. The gyroscope function of the 3DS can even be used to shake the breasts of the female figurines in showcase mode (which helps to add considerably to that mode's oddly voyeuristic feel). Moreover, the costumes on these ladies (especially the downloadable ones) can be very skimpy and/or kinky. Consider that at least two female fighters can be dressed up in cat ears and skin-tight leotards which take care to preserve an ample amount of cleavage in the breast area. This will be a definite pro for some and a con to others. This game's focus on T&A; will come across as either awesome or creepy, depending upon your personal temperament and proclivities. If you're uncomfortable with women being dressed and presented as sex objects, I'd advise you to either avoid this game entirely or else only play one of the male characters.There aren't too many problems with this game, but a very big one for me is the implementation of 3D. It's not that the 3D looks bad (although some uses of it are better than others: for instance, it is very awesome, when you play this game for the first time, to watch the game's title pop-out at you in the opening screen, but cut-scenes and battles look pretty unimpressive in 3D), but that turning the 3D on during battles cuts the frame rate from 60 fps to 30! This isn't a problem for some other games with less-than-stellar 3D processing, such as certain turn-based strategy games, but a fighting game needs fast gameplay, and the 3D just kills this title's speed. This wouldn't be a huge issue for a budget title, but DOA is a big franchise! Also, I know for a fact that this game could have done better. Mario Kart 7, for instance, both has a far superior 3D effect AND runs at 60 fps with the 3D turned on. Similarly, games like RE: Revelations do great 3D just fine. I play through almost everything on this system with the 3D enabled, even for virtual console games, where the outside border can be given a slight 3D pop. But I just have to turn off the 3D for the battles in this game, which, of course, are the meat-and-potatoes in any fighting game. It doesn't kill my enjoyment of this, obviously, but it does keep it from being a five-star product. A 3D game on a 3D system should be able to process 3D battles without choking on them.Ultimately, game-play is the most importantly aspect of any game, and DOA: Dimensions shines in this respect. The game is available here on Amazon for under $30, which is an excellent price. Fighting games tend to be one of my less favorite game genres, and yet I've spent quite a bit of time on this game. It is fun. Flawed, but fun. Recommended.", "I've been a fan of Dead or Alive (DOA) since DOA 3 released for the Xbox in 2001. Since then I've played them all and have been longing for DOA to go portable, after the dull DOA Paradise released for the PSP I had lost all hope in DOA ever becoming portable until I seen DOA Dimensions for the 3DS (it's actually why I purchased a 3DS). Dimensions is just as fun and addicting as the console versions, and offers the biggest character roster yet with a total of 25 playable characters. In Dimensions there is a total of 10 play modes the main one is Chronicle mode, this tells the story of all 4 DOA's and brings you up to speed with what has happened in the series so far. All the CG's used in the previous games have been reused here . Unfortunately if you don't have any idea about the DOA universe Chronicle mode's story will make little, if any, sense to you. Chronicle mode does not take very long to beat, about 3-4 hours. After that you have survival mode, arcade mode, and tag team which are all very fun and get harder with each course, after you beat a course you unlock either different costumes, or different portraits for all the characters. You also have to work to unlock the roster list as you only have 5 people available to you at the start of the game.Graphically Dimensions is stunning, I honestly could not believe that this little handheld was so powerful, Dimensions graphics sits at around the Dreamcast level and runs smooth  in 2D and 3D although the 3D does make the game run slower. I had a fun time with 3D as it was something different but liked the 2D better (things move faster.) Music is also pretty good but there was nothing catchy or overly memorable, voice acting was also pretty good, the voices can be set to either English or Japanese with subtitles on or off. The English voice acting is decent enough but all the battle cry's are still in Japanese. Overall this is a great first time portable entry for DOA which I recommend to any 3DS owner who likes fighters or DOA in general.", "This game is awesome. I love and have been playing this game for almost 10 years. I love the graphics. It is so surreal. The story mode is included. I am unsure if this game is based on Dead or Alive 2, Dead or Alive 4, and or any other DOA game. This game deserves a 10 star rating.DOA 2: HardcoreDead or Alive 2Dead or Alive 3Dead or Alive UltimateDead or Alive 4", "The Good: Smooth and responsive controls, using the bottom screen for a combo list makes playing easier, 3D effects are fun, lots of modes, utilizes Street and SpotPass very well, playing online is a blast, lots of things to unlockThe Bad: Fight system is convoluted, story mode is pretty average, could have used more fighters and stagesI have never been a huge fan of Dead or Alive outside the characters. The fighting system is convoluted, over complicated, and not ever explained very well. Dimensions breaks this barrier with a great Chronicle story mode that introduces these complicated techniques little by little so you can absorb it and it works great. The story mode is entertaining but nothing to write home about. You play as various characters trying to stop Alpha-152 which is Kasumi's evil clone. DOATEC is trying to use this to destroy the ninja clan Mugen Tenshin.The fighting system actually is complicated but after the story mode you can actually use it. There are the usual combos of kick and punches, but you can juggle opponents and stun them in a critical state. You can throw and hold opponents while holding is kind of a counter attack you can actually counter a counter in this game. If someone counters your attack with a hold you can counter back or get out of the hold. Understanding how to do this take some getting used to but it adds some strategy to online fights. You can also do a super stun which is called OHing an opponent and this means they can't counter. There are also special stances that the characters go into which can be used to strategically add extra combos without the opponent knowing. You can also delay attacks in combos to kind of trick the other player in thinking your done so they stop blocking.The fight system is fluid and smooth with great animations and controls, but my favorite part is that the combos are listed on the bottom screen so you can tap them or just use them as a quick combo list. This is really handy and actually makes playing the game more enjoyable so you aren't constantly pausing the game to remember a combo. On top of this you can now tag team which is fun and adds some great combos into the fray. I liked the extra modes such as tag team, and infinite mode, and of course the showcase mode where you unlock figurines to take pictures in 3D.There are a lot of costumes to unlock to make the females look more sexy or the males look more cool and StreetPass and SpotPass are wonderfully integrated into the system. I'll have my 3DS in my pocket all day when going out then come home and have a few challenger ready to fight online that I passed when going out. I might even drive by a few SpotPass areas and come back with some downloaded costumes. Dimensions really utilizes these features and I have a blast using them.With all that said the 3D effects are amazing and really show off the systems features in this way, but overall the graphics are smooth and crisp and look very detailed. I highly recommend Dimensions because it's the best fighting game on the system right now.", "\"DOA Dimension is not a perfect game, but it is very close to be one.I must said that I'm not a DOA fan this is muy first DOA game, the game itself is well done, but had some mistakes.The graphics are very well done, the scenarios look great, some scenarios are not very animated, but still look good, the character itself are very well done and had a decent variety of attire, some of this atties can be earned fighting over and over and some can be obteined by Stopass , the sound in the game is decent too.The game play is rapid and fluid, if you are palyed \"\"Virtual Fighter\"\" or one of the first \"\"Takken\"\" game, you know how the fights in a DOA game looks like, you fights with combos of punches and kicks, the most of character can't jump, but you can throws your enemies and make a great variety of combos, actually when you make a combo sometimes you dont know exactly what kind of combo expect 'couse the fight is very rapid.The game is cool and can be addictive, but I said this game is almost exellent, had various fails first, the cronicles mode not explain the entire DOA's story (from DOA to DOA 4), the cronicle mode could be conffuse, for me this is not a big deal, the 2 big fails in my opinios are that in some games mode you can't choose the difficult level, making the game too much easily and the online play mode I expected that should be like the SSF4 online play mode, but is not, you search a opponent but you can't choose the skill level of your opponent, after the fight you lose the conection and continues searching for another player, it could be tedious if in this moment there are not much fighter online.  Well that 2 are the fails thet I foud in DOA Dimension, but even whit this fails this could be fun and addictive fighting game.\"", "Tecmo delivers, in my opinion, the second must own title of the 3DS so far, with OOT in first of course . . but anyways this game is sooooo fun it has tons and tons of cute little costumes to unlock for each character, you will be playing thru arcade mode over and over, but it is still fun because the gameplay is great. Grinding to unlock everything you possibly can, you got hundreds of figurines to collect to. It will take your mind off of stress and have you enjoying the game like you would have as a kid.", "This games marks the first time the Dead or Alive series is on a Nintendo console, and the 3DS does the franchise justice. Great visuals, lots of replay value, and it makes use of every 3DS feature (spotpass? streetpass? coins? wifi? local multiplayer?) all here in a high quality package. This game marks the first time for me that I can log onto my 3DS wondering what new content has downloaded via spotpass. During a fight, the bottom touch screen acts as a guide to combos, or you can just tap the combo you want with your thumb and your character will automatically perform it which is a nice feature. Because you have to look down for a split second (an eternity in fighting games) its been my experience that by the time you select the proper combo/block/throw your opponent many times has already moved on to another position, especially if your trying to do a throw or hold instead of a strike.Having said all that, I feel that the online multiplayer needs work, first off almost every fight seems to have some lag, from just a little to so much its unplayable. Now I know you may start to say its my connection but I have to say, I have a high speed cable connection and have not had any lag on anything in recent memory besides this game. Aside from lag issues another thing I dont like about the online is; you meet up, you fight once, your disconnected from each other and have to go back to the lobby to search for someone else. I would have liked the option to go a few rounds with the same person instead of just one round. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I havent seen any online leader boards? Aside from the online needing work, the fps really does take a hit with the 3D on, which on single player doesnt really seem to bother me but may with some people.", "I've tried both Tekken and Street Fighter for 3DS, which are both good fighting games, but Dead or Alive Dimensions is definitely the best. I didn't know what to expect from this game, but I was at Kmart and they had it in the clearance bin for $9.99, so I decided to pick it up. Not only is it crammed with content, but it's all of really high quality.The graphics are incredibly detailed and look very nice on the 3DS. Fighting is quick and snappy with a solid framerate. This game performs very well considering its level of detail in the visuals department. It's buttery smooth and looks great all around.I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the story mode. Usually story modes are throwaway in fighting games, in my opinion, however I really enjoyed this one. It can move around a bit too much and get confusing, but it's always enjoyable watching the cutscenes.With great graphics, a very expansive package of content, and very good gameplay mechanics, Dead or Alive Dimensions is a definite buy for 3DS fighting fans."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06136844679713249, 0.10814069956541061, 0.0922723114490509, 0.004150786437094212, 0.002372289076447487, 0.005512297619134188, 0.0558256171643734, 0.018456386402249336, 0.08427830785512924, 0.004939368925988674, 0.0988059937953949, 0.058616187423467636, 0.006091691087931395, 0.09407396614551544, 0.022192856296896935, 0.005811559502035379, 0.09397861361503601, 0.1509258896112442, 0.03218671306967735]]}
