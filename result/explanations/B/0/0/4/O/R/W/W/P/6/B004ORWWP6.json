We've even had it six months, and with standard 4 year old use (which is to say more drops, kicks, and door slams than I can count), it still works fine. I have no idea why the makers felt the need to include the T-Rex armor, missile launcher, and person in some sort of attachment. Since when is T-Rex himself not good enough for a 4 year old? My daughter claims that it's T-Rex playing \"\"dress up\"\". Additionally, those pieces are hard for small children to attach anyway, so it wasn't long before they were stuck in a corner and forgotten about. The main part is great though - T-Rex moves his body slightly and roars. He can pivot on his major joints, and is balanced enough that he can stand freely in most positions. The makers also wisely left his mouth open so he can \"\"eat\"\" things (other toys), which is a favorite pastime in my house.\"", "\"What could be cooler than a T-REX that launches missiles? If you're around 6 and sort of a tomboy, the answer is--not much. So imagine my surprise, when she gave up on this toy after a afternoon or so. There is almost nothing so painful as going out of your way to obtain a child's toy, only to have a lackluster reaction. Undeterred, I passed this toy along to my three year old boy who is just getting into dinosaurs. Let's just say I am 0 for 2 on this one. It turns out this TRex is simply TOO BIG, TOO COMPLICATED, and comes with TOO MANY PIECES. My efforts to incorporate the toy back into play time have been completely re-buffed first grade style. \"\"Why would a person be riding a TRex anyway?\"\" is one of the many questions, I haven't been able to satisfactorily respond to. I guess TOO IMAGINITIVE also makes the list.\"", "A dinosaur with removable armor and mechanical claws that roars and can launch missiles?!?  My children couldn't get this out of the box fast enough.  They have had it for a few weeks now, and while it doesn't enjoy the hours of play it received the first day, the T-Rex is still used at least once a day.Pros:  It's a great, large dinosaur!  Easy to hold and maneuver, and lots of fun with the accessories.  My kids have used it fully geared-up, and without all of the armor as your typical T-Rex.  They love to stomp around the house with it and make it roar.  It's also pretty durable, as I've come to expect from Imaginext.  My children are 3 and 5, and this T-Rex has seen a good thrashing.  It still has all of its pieces and nothing has cracked or fallen apart.  It does require batteries, but battery life seems reasonable.Cons: It is a little unstable due to the large head.  It does topple over when standing if you don't position it exactly right.  Still, it's pretty fun!  And no, it does not walk on its own, but my kids seem to have more fun stomping through the house and making their own noises and movements than using a remote control.Highly recommended!", "The good:-- Kids think this toy is cool-- Even though it's plastic, it's tougher than you'd think-- It has enough complexity built into it to keep kids' minds whirring-- Comes with batteries-- Can be used in conjunction with similar Fisher-Price Imaginext toys-- Good sound effects-- Priced about rightThe bad:-- Multiple pieces to lose-- Not overtly educational, if that's your thingThe ugly:-- Nothing so bad as to rate as uglyOverall, this is a solidly built, fun toy for kids between 4 and 6.", "You can't pick a better thrill for young boys than a moving, roaring T-rex with a man on it and missiles it shoots. I think any young boy will love it, as my son does.  It is a cool toy. The only problem is the the two missile holders seem to come off easily and my son needs help replacing them in the man's saddle.", "My son absolutely loves the Imaginext series. So it was a given that we get the T-Rex to add to his collection. Especially since the show Terra Nova is now his favorite show, these toys have been given new life. The toy is very sturdy and durable. It stands about 10 inches tall, so it will have a huge presence in your child's toy box. Other than that, there is not much I can say except that he really does love it.", "My soon-to-be-three-year-old Son loves his Imaginext toys, and the Mega T-Rex is no exception. Like all of the Imaginext toys, it's extremely durable, which is great, since boy toys take one hell of a beating. In the month since receiving this toy for Christmas, it's been beaten and battered, but it's completely unscathed and working fine. My Son isn't too interested in the armor, so that's been left off of the T-Rex, but the motion and the sound effects are great, and he loves the fact that the included figure is compatible with his other Imaginext figures and playsets. Overall, this toy is a huge hit in our house.", "I remember as a kid a cartoon called Dino-Riders where people rode Dinosaurs and had weapons attached to them.  This toy reminds me of that.  My nephew doesn't know anything about Dino-Riders but he does know this toy is packed full of fun.  He really enjoyed playing with it.  He is an intelligent kid, 5 years old and loves electronics so I was surprised sort of when he played with this.The T-Rex moves and growls when you press a button on his tail.  You can also remove all the armor and have him be a normal dinosaur.  But what kid wants a normal dinosaur when you can have an armored missile firing one?  The toy is actually quite big and is ideal for kids over 3.  It looks pretty durable and I feel it can stand up to some punishment dished out by kids.It's a cool fun toy that any child will love.  I know if I was a kid I would enjoy this.  Heck, even as an adult I can say it's pretty cool.  I enjoy pressing the button on it's tail to hear him growl and move.If you have kids, or know kids who enjoy Dinosaurs, this is the toy to get.", "\"I would have loved to save this toy for Xmas but wanted to play with it myself the moment it arrived.  Before our Little Paleontologist could even see the toy, my husband and I had the T-Rex out of the box and were playing Land of the Lost!  Boy does this monster ROAR like  Dinosaur should in our imgainations!  We didn't even bother with the weapons, since the plain T-Rex was plenty of fun by itself.  Our little man thought the same thing for almost anm hour, terrifying the cats with his feirce visage, decent movement and that fabulous Roar!The battle weapons are pretty neat and although this toy is part of a series, it isn't necessary to buy the other toys to have fun with it as it was with some other toys we've gotten to review.  I was very pleased to see that.  The action figure is the same size as most of the ones we have and so it didn't take our fella much time to integrate him into the little world of his \"\"guys\"\"  If anything, he thought this was one of the good soldiers from Avatar who was riding the T-rex to fight the soldiers trying to destroy the Navi.  well, uh.. OK by me!  Whatever makes his boat float.  That said, the enticing illustrations on the back of other Battle Dinosaurs in the series, especially theFisher-Price Imaginext Apatosaurus Dinoand theFisher-Price Imaginext Triceraptops Dinobrought pleas of \"\"Oh, can I please get these too???\"\"  Yikes.  Well, the Triceritops is inexpensive and the Apatosuarus isn't too steep either so, I've put those on my once a month Toy list for holiday & birthday gifts.  I've also let the family know that this series of toys has captured my kid's imagination and added them to the wishlist for family.  This piece was the priciest one, so adding more from the series, one at a time, may be a good way to sustain interest in the toy.As for this toy: The guns shoot plastic darts and there were NO  pieces that would fit through my \"\"child can choke on it\"\" device\"\" so the age range listed is appropriate but I don't know if 3 and 4 year olds should really be encouraged to play with fairly realistic, if cartoonish, weapons - that's a parent by parent call to make.  My child is in the mid-range and enjoyed playing with the T-Rex Dinosaur all by itself just as much as playing with the T-Rex all tricked out for battle.The battle gear snaps on and off easily and given the rough play we gave it, I consider it to be better than average on durability.  The T-Rex himself is the star of the show with movements at his neck, torso and legs.  There is a large, child friendly button to hold down on his tail to make him roar and thrash back and forth.  The Guns reloaded easily and even with some very ham-fisted snapping on and off, nothing broke or snapped.  I'm going with 5 stars for now because usually most toys of this type would be in pieces after a week and change of very heavy play by adults and a few kids.  For fun - it was simply off the charts for both kids and adults.I gave it four stars for educational value only because it made my child more interested in the T-Rex and Dinosaurs again (it comes and goes with him) and we looked up some info on Dinosaurs when I told him that there's an even bigger Dino than a T-Rex called Giganotosaurus and that a friend of mine from before he was born helped carry it's Skull replica to a meeting in NYC and I showed him the TV show that depicted this.  That led to a long Web-surfing session to find coloring pages for show & tell and the stripped down T-Rex went to school (without his battlegear) along with photos of Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus  a Dino of a different family who is bigger even than Gigo).  It's rare that a plastic toy generates that amount of interest in our house.  If you get this toy, try taking off all the battle-gear and starting a discussion about the lergest Dinosaurs and see where it goes.  You might get the same response I did if you have a kid in the Dinosaur phase.Overall, we were thrilled with this toy and certainly plan to either purchase more in the series ourselves or hopefully get them as gifts from relatives who use our Wishlist this year.  My one word of advice about wishlisting toys is to buy the biggest, priciest piece yourself if you plan on asking relatives and friends to fill out the series as their gift.  That way, in these tough economic times, you're giving others the chance to fill out the Toy set and still stay within their budgets.  If you can't do that, suggest two people go in on this toy because it really is fun and it's the largest one in the series.Imaginext makes other grouped series of toys and the one that interest my child the most was the one Aircraft carrier with the tricked out World War II looking planes.  I went to the Imaginext Website and found They had a video called \"\"Either Ore\"\" that featured the battle Dinosuar toys who were searching for a substance called Volcanium which powers them.  It's computer animated and basically a commercial but my child enjoyed it even though the T-rex's rider was a bad guy.  Also on the website are some activity pages featuring the Dino toys that included interactive puzzles, games and printable coloring pages.  If you have any of the Imaginext toys, you should definately go there for the coloring pages alone.  Just keep in mind, it's all free advertising.\"", "If I could give this toy six stars, I would.  We really love it.  I have a 12 year old daughter and a 4 year old son and bought it for my son, yet it seems like my daughter plays with it as much as he does.  I even find myself sitting down playing with it when the kids aren't around!  We have some of the other Imaginext dinosaur toys, but this one takes the cake.- I didn't realize when I bought it that it moved and growled with the push of a button.  That is the absolute best part.- The accessories that attach to the dinosaur have grooves so they snap on tight and don't fall off- The dart type things shoot well, but not hard enough to hurt anyone.- It is big and sturdy, yet not too big or heavy for a four year old to haul up and down the stairs.Overall, it is a cute toy that does exactly what it says it will and it is a ton of fun!", "The Fisher-Price Mega Dino T-Rex is another offering from their Imaginext line. It's an imposing figure, standing over a foot high and quite hefty as well. His head shakes  and he roars when you press a button in his tail. There is an attached chariot of sorts on his back that includes a pair of spring-loaded cannons (be careful with younger kids - one of our cannons was wound pretty tightly). And since he's a dinosaur cyborg, he'll promote all sorts of imaginative play for your 4-to-10 year-old.The Mega Dino is solidly built and feels like it would withstand a lot of playtime. I've docked it a star simply based on the price, which seems a bit high given the relativeStraightforward simplicity of the toy (which is a plus).", "\"We love Imaginext toys, they're oversized but not babyish like the ones they just outgrew and have lots of discover-able items. The dart type \"\"weapons/hooks\"\" were a big hit on this, as they were with the other Imaginext sets we have (such as the water cannon in the Fire Station, or the harpoon-ish thing in the underwater lab). The rider, the roaring, and the wiggling body just didn't seem to impress my kids. They dressed it up a couple of times with it's visor and carriage, but have hardly returned to it since and pretty much never touch the roar button. While my kids are all out nuts about dinosaurs, they do recognize them and seem to take at least a moderate interest in them (Dinosaur Train is requested from time to time by them), so I expected them to like it a bit more than they do. So I'm going to write this off as just a kid preference thing, since it's well made and I think it's pretty neat and pressed the roar/wiggle button more than enough times to make up for their indifference to it.\"", "Science fiction is fun.  Dinosaurs are fun.  Combine them together and what do you get?  Fisher-Price's Imaginext Mega T-Rex Dino!While Fisher-Price isn't introducing anything entirely new to the dino/sci-fi toy arena, they have made this particular type of toy accessible to youngsters.  Their Imaginext line has been producing excellent imagination-triggering toys for some time now, and the Mega T-Rex Dino is another fine addition to this series.Rex has a detachable visor that fits snugly over his eyes and the top of his nose.  Also included is a control pod that can be opened by the included rider (who also has a removable helmet).Rex also comes equipped with detachable mechanical claws that move fluidly with his actual claws whenever he roars.  The roar is controlled by a trigger on the top of Rex' tail.  His arms, neck, head, and jaws move in a circular motion while he roars.  When he fully extends his neck, he stands roughly sixteen inches tall.Two launchers are also included, one of which fires a grappling hook-type weapon and the other fires a weapon that looks a lot like a two-headed spear.  Children can get pretty good distance with both of these launchers, but they don't appear to be any danger to youngsters.  The launchers can be attached to the rider's pod as well.The best part of all of the included armor and weaponry is that it can all be taken off of Rex and kids can play with him as a traditional T-Rex.This toy is compatible with the other toys in the Imaginext line.  My son is a big fan of the Batman toys in this series, and I expect Batman and Robin to take on Rex and his rider in the very near future.Highly recommended.", "\"This T-Rex is pretty darn amazing.  When you hold down the button on the tail, the neck and head move in an amazing range of motion and some pretty hefty dino-roaring is heard.  This guy might even be a bit scary for kids on the younger side.  I like that the armor snaps right off so that you can play just with the dino.  As the marketing copy says, \"\"he throws his head back, opens his jaws, and lets out a ferocious roar. His arms and tail are also animated.\"\"  The roar is quite vicious sounding and the animated movements are more sophisticated than I expected.  I can see this will be a favorite toy.\"", "I received the Fisher Price Imaginext Mega T-Rex Dino from Amazon and gave it to my son.  Initially, like most toys these days, it was really difficult to remove from the packaging.  There was also a lot of smaller parts, so this toy is definitely not for kids who still pick up toys and put them in their mouths.  The dinosaur moves and roars and has a seat that attaches to it, which contains a little figurine (also with small parts).  You can shoot little plastic darts across the room with the dinosaur attachments. Once we were able to get all the parts together and get all of it out of the packaging, which took quite a bit of time, the kids totally loved it.  I got this for my 5 year old son, but all my kids (even the older girls) were playing with it.  The biggest problem we have had was finding the parts.  Some of them are easy to lose.  It would have been nice if the dinosaur contained a compartment to store these little pieces.  Even with all of that, this toy is so much fun.  My son loves it.  His favorite thing to do is shoot the little arrow things from the dinosaur and press the button to make it roar.  The dinosaur moves up and down when he roars.  It really is a neat toy and brings lots of joy to my son, so I think its a great product.  Usually these toys get played with for a day and then the kid is bored of it, but my son is still playing with it and enjoying it.This isn't a very educational toy, but it does spark an interest in learning more about dinosaurs, so I like it.", "We own a lot of Imaginext stuff for our two boys.  This T-Rex is the latest addition and it offers quite a bit of options for the boys to have fun.  we already have one of the smaller dinosaurs that walks and growls when you push the button on the back but this mega edition one makes the old one look like an ant!  This is quite big!Both my sons played with this for quite a while when they opened it up.  The hit of the T-Rex is the backpack section that contains the 2 guns that fire the little cannon things.  In fact, that was probably the only thing they played with!Unlike the smaller dino that Imaginext makes, this one does not walk when the button is pushed.  This one simply moves its head around and growls.  A bit disapponting but I was aware of that before we got it.I found that some of the clip on pieces such as the head armor did not stay on very well and kept falling off anytime one of my kids would move the T-rex.  Also, you can adjust the legs on the T-rex to make him stand in various levels but I found that the legs seems a bit loose so it had a tendency to fall over on occasion when everything was loaded onto the back of it. It didn;t happen all the time.  Other than these little flaws, this is easy to use and setup.The overall quality is similar to other Imaginext toys.  It seems very solid and I assume it will hold up to the abuse that 4 year olds will give it.  We have a bin that holds all of our Imaginext stuff and, unlike other toys in our house, these tend to get used a lot by our kids and their friends when they are over.  Based on the amount of accessories that come with the Mega T-Rex, I am confident that this will be a favorite for quite a while.", "As a mom of four boys, we have found Imaginext toys to be not only some of the best toys on the market, but some of the most enjoyable to play with.  We have bins and bins of them, starting with the old school construction sets.  We also own all the dinosaurs that came out a few years back.  They are similar to these dinosaurs, but they did not come with all this FUN battle gear.Pros:-Easy packaging.  It was very easy to get the toy out of the package.-Fun to play with - Very imaginative-Educational - Everyone marked it down in educational, but taking everything off and on, figuring out how everything works, that is a challenge for a little guy, and I think that teaches a nice skill.-Durable - We have owned all the Transformers, Nerf guns, ATV ride-ons etc., and our Imaginext are the only toy that I would recommend with a 5 star for durability.  In the hundreds of pieces that we own, we have only ever had 3 break.  We had a piece break off a whale, a leg off the giraffe, and a leg off a jaguar.  We have not yet had a dinosaur break.-They come with the batteries! And if the batteries die, they are still fun to play with.-Big, but not too big.  They are big enough for little hands to play with, but not too big to be unmanageable.  Spike, the remote control dinosaur was too big for a little guy to manage.-I love that it comes with so many pieces.  You can buy additional pieces, but this is a lot of pieces, so it should give a lot of playing fun.Cons:-The cockpit lid seems to pop off a little too much.  It is easy to get back on, but they could have probably fixed the design.-I also think the front battle gear that hooks to the arms is a little tricky for the little guys.  However, my 5 year old did fine.  My four year old struggled a little.My final review gives this toy 5 stars.  They have taken their old design (which all the neighborhood kids come over to our house to play with), and added the fun battle gear and guy.  I love that the guys are interchangeable with the sets, and the gear for the guys swaps.  It is very nice if your kids have several sets and swap around.  I would definitely choose these over any other toy on the market.  My kids love them and they are durable.  Also, we have a couple of the large Fisher Price remote control things (spike, and the cave man), and I wouldn't recommend those.  Their batteries stop holding a charge.  This guy takes regular batteries, and as I pointed out before, it not only comes with the batteries, but if they die you can continue to play with this toy.  We WILL be purchasing the rest in the set for Christmas this year.", "\"When I saw this toy was available through amazon vine, I ordered it immediately. My kids have lots of Imaginext toys sets, including theFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends The Joker's Fun House, theFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Batcave, theFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Batcopter, theFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Batwing, and various assorted castles and treehouses that are no longer available. Some of these we purchased new, and others we picked up at garage sales. One thing you can count on with these Imaginext toys is that they will hold up over time (despite frequent use), and they are easily re-sold when your kids have out-grown them. This new dinosaur-themed set is no exception.Like all Imaginext toys, this one is colorful, cartoony-looking, and durable. Imaginext sets do not contain any small parts that could be easily lost or ingested - making them extremely kid-friendly. There are a few moving parts - appropriate to the age level for which the toy was intended. This particular dinosaur is also battery-powered (batteries INCLUDED!) and tosses its head about and audibly roars when you press a button on its back. Stuff like this is fun for kids - though they have no problem improvising their own dinosaur roars when playing!Educationally, this toy offers nothing of substance. It is purely a \"\"for-fun\"\" play toy, and my 4-year son loved it! He enjoyed using it to attack his Batcave and castle sets. Overall, I'm quite happy with this toy, and I would recommend it to other parents with young boys.\"", "The Fisher-Price Imaginext Mega T-Rex Dino is a great, sturdy, fun toy. My son played with it and managed to figure out how to use it in no time. It is simple and straight forward. The toy itself is made of strong plastic and stood up to the abuse of an overly hyper pre-schooler. This toy was a bit noisy but not overly obnoxious, it roars which my son liked and imitated.I have to say this toy is quite a bit larger than I thought it was, which made it all the more fun for my son. It came with accessories that are large enough that they are not easily lost which is great, but I still recommend storing them in a container like a baggie to keep with the toy. The toy is light for it's size, my son could move it by himself.This is a great toy for a kid of almost any age and would be a great addition to a dinosaur lover's toy collection.", "My seven-year-old daughter really likes this toy.  You can move it around manually.  You can use the battery operated function to make it swing its head and arms around and roar.  You can shot the little guns.  You can move the little man around.  You can turn a lever--and the control pod windshield pops off.  You can put the little man in and out of the control pod.  And there are quite a few do-dad things that she finds fun to take on and off the dinosaur.Anyway, for whatever reason, she likes this thing.  I think she likes bending the thing into different positions more than anything.  Plus she likes shooting the two little weapons that launch arrow like things across the room--well, 4 or 5 feet anyway (the weapons are fun without being dangerous).  She likes taking everything off the dinosaur and pretending it is a sliding board for the little man.To sum up, my daughter really likes this toy.  I didn't really expect that.  I got this toy (because I thought it looked cool) figuring I would just have it at home for when other kids or relative's kids showed up so they would have something nifty to play with.  But when the toy arrived, my daughter was wanting it bad.  So I gave it to her.  She has been playing with it ever since.My daughter definitely gets a lot of play time out of it.  I would say this is a pretty good toy.Other stuff:1. This toy seems pretty well built, so it should be durable.2. Fisher Price used twine and plastic zip ties to hold this in the box.  Both of these are easy to cut with scissors or untie if you want to take more time.  This is much easier to deal with than those irritating wire twist things that some toys are held in with.  And they use just enough to hold everything in place instead of seemingly bazillions of them."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.044265519827604294, 0.03570406883955002, 0.051940836012363434, 0.04771772772073746, 0.0463087372481823, 0.0519770123064518, 0.044400718063116074, 0.05607103928923607, 0.04420187324285507, 0.0639672502875328, 0.05761995166540146, 0.05226103961467743, 0.03024492971599102, 0.05652330443263054, 0.06168605014681816, 0.04981551319360733, 0.04926522448658943, 0.05668201297521591, 0.04463467746973038, 0.05471252277493477]]}
