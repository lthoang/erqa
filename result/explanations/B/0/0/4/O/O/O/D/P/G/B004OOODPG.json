I don't drink the Apple kool-aide so I only use Windows on the PC, some linux, and Android tablets and phones.The Screen:I've seen some complaints about playing the screen lottery and hoping you get the \"\"good\"\" glass panel. Who cares. I checked and got the \"\"bad\"\" screen. It still is one of the best picture I've seen in a TV. Everyone who comes over and sees an HD over the air station is blown away. My mom wants to sell her sony bravia now and get an LG. Everything is so bright and vivid. The TV has a sensor that detects when the room gets dark and dims the screen. I saw some complaints about that, but I liked it. Your eyes get used to the dimness fairly quickly, you are saving electricity and it has to be easier on your eyes (see your local optometrist for further details). There are Max, Mid, Min, or off settings if you want to customize or not use it at all. Several people mentioned that calibration is needed to make this TV show its true colors and I couldn't agree more. Thankfully there is a nice and easy wizard that helps you set it up correctly. Once it's set up, it's fantastic.The Remote:The TV comes with a traditional IR remote and a new \"\"Wii-like\"\" wand remote. I haven't used the IR remote since I bought the TV. The wand responds better than a Wii remote and you don't have to point it at the screen. You know how the Wii remote would wiggle and you were flipping your hand all over the place to realign the cursor on the screen? The LG wand is stable and very responsive, I was blown away and didn't expect that at all. It comes in handy when you need to sign into Google things, Netflix, search YouTube and on and on. Although the superior solution is to download the free LG app from your android phone and control the TV from your phone. You can import your favorite channels and select them and use your whole touch screen as a track-pad to move the cursor on the screen. Just make sure you and your TV are both connected to the same network.The Apps:It's pretty cool to have Google Maps, Picasa, YouTube, Netflix, a Web browser and streaming radio apps. What I don't understand is that I can stream Netflix movies perfectly and can jump back and forth through a movie fairly quickly but the YouTube app is absolute rubbish. It is slow, there is hardly a user interface, it is not user friendly, the videos stream for a few seconds then buffer for 30 seconds. I have tablets, smartphones, laptops and desktops all using YouTube and there is no lag on my 6Mb connection. My 15 month old daughter with a 20 second attention span runs in the living room asking for elmo and leaves after 5 minutes because it's still not loading. When you fire up YouTube it automatically starts playing a completely random video, taking up precious bandwidth and slowing down my search. Enough complaining....it needs serious work. The other apps are sort of slow but this is a TV not a Revue, Roku or a Core i7 Windows Media Center PC, so don't expect to be wowed with speed.Software Features:The BEST feature IMHO is Plex. If you aren't aware of the capabilities of Plex, Google it. I can watch and listen to all my divx/xvid/mkv movies and mp3 collection streamed from my Win7 desktop PC. The Plex software scans your PC for movies and pulls movie details such as pictures, ratings, reviews, synopsis and more and displays them in a beautiful scroll-able interface on the LG screen. Plex is free, get it.The TV also supports DLNA so I can right click an mp3 or movie on any of my windows 7 machines and click \"\"play to\"\" and select my TV and it tries to start playing but I haven't successfully gotten it to work, nor have I tried to find out why. Plex works so I haven't troubleshooted, but I see the option there.When you click the \"\"Homelink\"\" button on the remote it brings up a nice clean interface that is easy to understand. You can get to your settings, apps, favorite channels, or switch the inputs.Sound:TV sound is on par for TV speakers. Where I was pleasantly surprised is when I plugged in an HDMI cable into myOnkyo TX-NR609 7.2 Channel Network THX Certified A/V Receiver(which can also be controlled with a free Onkyo app for android). Once I made a few changes on the Onkyo receiver I was able to use the volume on my TV's remote and it said \"\"Home Theater\"\" inside the onscreen volume circle in the bottom right. It pushed the sound down to the receiver through the HDMI cable and recognized it automatically. Then when the receiver is off the sound reroutes back to the TV speakers. I read some complaints that the only audio out is a single optical out connection. I guess that's true physically because there aren't any 1/8th inch connections, but I can send it through HDMI so I'm happy.Hopefully I've covered some of the things the other reviewers haven't covered. I highly recommend this TV and will buy LG again. Note: I upgraded from a Samsung DLP which worked fine but finally died after 4 years.\"", "I bought this TV because it fit whatever my wife and I expected. I only wanted a larger and lighter TV that would look better in my home, after having considerable pain moving my old TV around.The TV came to me in 2 days after I placed the order. The picture quality is good, at least I am satisfied; the settings were quite easy and I did not really have to go through the manual. The only crappy thing I noticed so far is the apps, specifically Youtube. It works in the weirdest way I could have imagined. Being a programmer, I would certainly not like to design an app this sucky. The other apps are nothing great too. They had a Nero MediaHome CD in the box that allows me to share videos from laptop and play them on TV. I'm using it to play DVDs.The first few days I had a weird buzzing noise while changing channels, but it turned out to be signal interference. Incidentally I switched cable service and that problem was solved automagically. The experience has been good that point forward and I do not regret purchasing this.", "This TV is awesome. I knew that the picture quality was awesome, that is why I bought it but the smart features that come with it, the apps such as Netflix, hulu, etc and all the DNLA compliant stuff make it great.I can do things like sit at my computer on one side of the house, right click on a movie and hit send to TV, on the other side of the house the movie starts on the TV, how awesome is thatThere are numerous input/output options, no real limitations thereIt is slim, sleek and sexy and extremely light for such a big TV while being very sturdy at the same timeHighly recommended", "\"Update 7/6/11: Firmware update 4.0.11 adds hulu plus.  This will be of interest to some users.Pros:Nice large crisp pictureHuge number of picture adjustmentsLow Power consumptionIncludes Wireless Network Adapter that can act as a routerViewing angleCons:Not many appsHad to configure for best image quality for moviesAuto back light becomes annoying (disable it)Some light bleeding is noticeable on black backgrounds with white text.Bottom Line:Nice TV.  Remote is easy to use, controls are intuitive.  It offers a huge number of picture adjustments for calibration purposes.  Lots of inputs, and nice slim design.The image is nice and sharp (and not overly sharp).  Browse the internet review sites to find some values for setting image parameters up for best image quality (or at least a starting point).  The \"\"Cinema\"\" mode isn't bad if you turn off the auto back light (this feature turns the back light off for dark scenes, but it is noticeable on this TV model as it is a global back light.  The more expensive models have a localized back lights that might be less noticeable.Power consumption with the back light at max is about 115 watts (nominal) and about 30 watts with the back light off (measured with my Kill-A-Watt).  So even though this is a 46.9\"\" TV, the power consumption is less than my older 32\"\" LCD TV that used a fluorescent back light instead of an LED light.  Plus it is a lot slimmer because of it.Wireless network was really easy to setup.  I plugged it in, entered my network settings, and was connected immediately.  The software/apps are a little slow running, but the Internet stream seems fine (I only have a slow 1.5 mbps connection).This TV also has a great viewing angle, better than many LCD TVs and nice in a room where you need a wide range of viewing angles.Hopefully the selection of Apps improves soon.  At least it does have Netflix and a couple others, but the number of total Apps I saw measured only a couple dozen.I felt the default image quality mode wasn't really suitable (but it was in part due to the poor Harry Potter transfer).  I still felt I had to make a few adjustments to it though.  What I do like is that each input has its own configuration (i.e. you can have different configurations for HDMI and the TV, etc).Since this isn't an edge lit LCD it doesn't have too many bright spots around the edge, but I still notice some white that will show through sometimes when there is a black background with white text.Since it is running an operating system you get issues of things with operating systems.  Apps aren't available immediately after startup (but the picture from the tuner is available immediately), it might take 30 seconds or so before you can launch the Apps.  I also had a random reboot (just once).  On the plus side is you can get firmware updates with new functionality, bug fixes, etc.Overall it is a good TV with very nice image quality.  The box that it comes packed in is relatively small (nice if you have to transport it by smaller car), and everything seems well thought out.\"", "\"I bought this TV a few days ago, and have been fiddling around with it. My jaw literally hit the floor at the quality of the picture, and I really like the built-in network savvy, web browser, and netflix player.Pro:+ Awesome picture! blacks are much blacker than my other TV, and truMotion or 120hz refresh (or both?) make a visible, positive difference in picture quality+ TV looks nice, and is very thin and light for its size+ includes both a normal remote and a wiimote-like remote that you can use to point at click at the screen like a mouse+ built in network support, web browser, netflix client, and many other features. If you're trying to make a guest comfortable, this keeps you from necessarily having to give them access to a separate computer, and increases their entertainment options.Con:- Software update is a little slow, it looks like it downloads a whole new OS each time rather than just patches. Hopefully it won't need to be updated often.CONFIGURATION:I've got my TV hooked up to an XBox-360 via HDMI, and the XBox in turn is acting as an extended for a Windows Media Center for TV, and Windows Home Server for ripped movies. I have a mixture of SD and HD content on my network, and a 30 Mbps download speed. I'm using the included wireless adapter for the TV, in addition to the built-in wireless for the XBox-360. I went through the software update for the TV, and am running 4.02.xxx I believe, upgraded from the 3.xx.xxx it shipped with.DETAILSThe TV is incredibly thin! You just don't appreciate how thin 1.5\"\" is until you see it first-hand. It's relatively light (for its size) as well, I was able to pick it up and move it on my own (though admittedly I'm a big guy). The base is stable, and though it doesn't allow movement up and down, the TV can pivot left and right on it, which is handy. The TV comes with a power cord, a USB wireless network adapter, a normal remote control, and a wii-like remote control with only a few buttons.It was easy to get the TV hooked up to the network, the on-screen configuration of wi-fi let it connect to my WPA-2 network with a password, no problem. The cables were easy to attach. The network adapter took a little hunting to find the USB ports (back, upper-left side as viewed from the front), but went in easy enough.I used the normal remote initially, but quickly switched to the wii-like remote. It's perfect for controlling the menu's and using the built-in apps. Other people have complained about the interface, but being familiar with design of UI for constrained input devices, I think they've done a reasonable job.The netflix client was easy to get running. I watched 'good will hunting' as my first movie. even though it's an old movie, the encoding was first rate. It was ASTONISHING watching it on this TV. I didn't expect the 120hz and tru-motion to matter at all, but man was I wrong. The movement looked so smooth and natural I was flabbergasted: it actually looks a bit weird (in a good way). I'm used to the encoding artifacts / blockiness, especially with smooth motion in encoded video, but after the first couple seconds of playback, there was none of that. It really is just amazing. I'd have to say, the picture is good enough that it's got me rethinking my other TV's (a 42\"\" HD tv and an HD projector). If a little extra smarts to do this tru-motion stuff and the 120hz makes that big a difference, I think I'm willing to pay for it.I really like the picture on this thing. Great detail - which you expect from any HDTV, but one thing that sticks out is that the blacks are noticably blacker than they are on my insignia LCD TV. I'll chalk that up to it being LED. And as I mentioned earlier, truMotion and 120hz makes a shockingly significant difference in quality of watching video.Other reviews have complained about the built-in apps and menu system. So far, I like them. I have played a bit with the web browser, and I have to say, it's nice having that wiimote thing to enter URL's, faster and easier for me than doing T9 on a remote numeric keypad. Nice that it remembers favorites. I visited aljazeera's website in both english and arabic, both rendered just fine.I also saw complaints about the sound quality in other reviews. I haven't cranked it up, but for as loud as I want it in the bedroom I've got it sitting in, the sound is just fine, at least as good as my other TV.In short, I'm gobsmacked by this TV. I am sold on the technology and will pay much more attention when it's time to replace my other TV's.\"", "\"Well... I was very excited to get this SMART TV!Turns out... Pandora is NOT available on this TV.  Support says Amazon should not have listed that.  It is only available on Bluray players by design.  Also... Hulu and other apps are schedule \"\"soon\"\" but they have no ETA on that at all.I should have gone with VIZIO which has it all plus a great slide out keyboard.LGs customer support is HORRIBLE!!!!  Their Chat FAILS to work on Firefox or Safari on my mac.  It would stop working and randomly quit.  So I filled out their online \"\"Email\"\" form which on submit takes me to a Temporarily Unavailable.  OMG!So after 40 minutes on the phone with their support... they finally say... Sorry they do not support it on TVs even though is is stated on the site.  Lame.Overall very disappointed in LG as a company.  They need to fix their support services online, get their marketing materials correct and somehow try to HELP resolve these issues or compensate the users.  But no... they just say sorry.I guess I need to complain to Amazon next I guess since LG was useless!------------------Update: July 8thLG released a firmware so Hulu Plus is now available.  No Pandora will ever be released per LG support. Amazon was responsive and gave be a small credit ($50) for the mis-representation in their advertising. I did not want to go through the hassle of a return since they use a special carrier to deliver.Overall the TV is good.  Not a fan of the Energy Saving mode or Dynamic Contrast... you end up with a strobe flutter effect in Dark scenes.  I turned both of them off right away.Comes with a Wireless Dongle which was a surprise.  The wand remote is odd and we never use it.  It has a free iPhone app which does the same thing so make sure you get that.\"", "This is our second LG LED LCD and even better than the one from 15 months ago.  What's great is LG includes the extra remote and USB dongle..... (other TV makers please take note..... other brands charge $50-$100 for the dongle and $50 plus on other accessories). Makes sense when spending $1000 plus in most cases on LED flat panel, all items should be included! Thanks LG for doing so.Amazing screen right out of the box and easily adjustable to fit your personal preferences. Visual like sound is something very personal and thus everyone sees and or hears things specific to themselves.Video games are outstanding along with HD broadcast and blu-ray of course. Standard definition looks fine to us. That will always pale in comparison to any HD or blu-ray broadcast.Thin and light by comparison of just LCD models from a couple years ago.Fits into any decor and you will get compliments all around. I have had many LG products over the years and personally fortunate to always have a good experience.Highly, highly recommend this TV. Like with anything go to a retail store and see the TV in action, go to more than one to compare to other brands and models as I said each person has a different view of screens/colors/sound and is a very personal preference. Make sure you purchase where they have a 15-30 day return policy as if you are not pleased you are not stuck with an item. READ instructions and learn how to change the settings and use the two remotes etc as that will only enhance your experience.", "\"Even in my very sunny living room, I can see this TV! It is better than I expected. The matte screen (instead of reflective) helps a lot. The audio is far superior to my old Sony WEGA. The picture is crystal clear, and is even an improvement on the non-HD channels. I originally saw the 47 inch version of this at Sears, and the picture at home is every bit as good.I agree with the others that the smart TV features are not great. But I have easily logged into Amazon instant videos and watched a free show there, and also a Home Cast Feature, which has TV and Movies for free. Not a member of Netflix, but probably will become one. Getting there did not seem difficult. The magic wand is kind of cool, but at times it is inconsistent. And a keyboard would be nice. There seems to be little support on the LG site for these issues.The LG Apps are pretty laughable. I will use my computer for games, etc. And I am really wondering why I can't get into Hulu. Having Flash on the machine and being able to update it seems to be a no-brainer. LG... please find the bit of brain we need to do this.I have not tried the networking feature, but will get to it. The manual is really not very good at letting me know how to navigate this thing. I am a techie, but I am still confused. I wish whomever wrote it had translated it out of tech and into English.The pricing on this is very annoying. At the time I bought it, Amazon had the cheapest price. Three days later, the price was reduced by about $35. I applied to Amazon for a refund based on this and got it. A few hours later it went down another $15. I have written Amazon a letter about this, as there is something fundamentally unfair about this. I suggest if you buy it, you check the price daily for the 14 day price match period and keep records. Then submit for the lowest price in that time. You will need a URL, price, and date for that. Good luck on finding the submission page. I think I got there the third or fourth time I went to \"\"my orders\"\".\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00022436313156504184, 0.19322507083415985, 0.2036118060350418, 0.0022697073873132467, 0.009295572526752949, 0.17736631631851196, 0.0009510181262157857, 0.4130561947822571]]}
