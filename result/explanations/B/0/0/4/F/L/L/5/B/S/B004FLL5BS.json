I took it everywhere for 10 nights. I took it snorkeling, I took it to the beach, I took it to the Grand cenote, I even took it zip lining into the water at XPLOR. Pictures are not amazing quality but they are more than enough for memories and it was great knowing I didn't have to worry about it getting wet and being underwater.Even though the processor is slow and it take a couple of seconds to start the camera, load pictures, etc. I would have given it 5 stars because it's such a great value for the price. However, we're sitting at the swim up bar on the last day of our honeymoon looking at the pictures and my wife asks me to delete one of them. So I press delete, it asks me if I want to delete just this picture or all of them. Obviously, I select the option that deletes this picture only and press enter. Then it says, are you sure you want to delete all your pictures? Now at this point I'm having a mild heart attack and I make sure to select NO and I hit enter. AND IT STARTS DELETING ALL THE PICTURES. I felt incredibly bad for about 2 hours because I thought I had lost over 300 pictures of my honeymoon. Now I'm tech savvy enough to know not to take any more pictures or all hope will be lost. I cross the street to radio shack and buy a card reader and download file recovery software and I was able to get 99% of my pictures back. Disaster averted, but an unnecessary experience.In conclusion, buy the camera, it works. Just DON'T try to do anything on the actual camera except take pictures and change settings. When you transfer all the images to your computer, then you can decide which ones to keep.", "I use this camera while paddling outrigger canoes, snorkeling, and for video taping swimmers in the pool.  This camera is great.Good:Takes great still pics in daylight.Color, focus, clarity are all really quite good.Others have mentioned poor battery life, but I am closing in on 300 pictures and 60 minutes of video and I am only on my second set of batteries after more than 6 months of use.  You just need to turn it off when you are not shooting pics. (this isn't your I phone)This is the 3rd waterproof camera I have used, and this is the first model that hasn't leaked.  Just be careful with sand.The bad:There is a long delay between depressing the button and the shutter, so not too hot for getting action shots.There is an even longer delay between taking one pic and waiting for it to reset for the next pic, even with a fast memory chip.You do need to hold it still while shooting pics, otherwise they will blur.In low light conditions the pics become very grainy (the flash overcomes this issue for nearby objects)The video is not stabilized so it can be very jumpy if you move the camera at all.During video shooting it doesn't seem to readjust the exposure as the light changes.Over all I am quite pleased with this camera.  The pictures can be quite stunningly beautiful.  The price can't be beat.  It is easy to use even wearing gloves.", "This has been a great camera.Others have posted their pictures of fish and underwater activities so I will skip that. Let me just say that my camera preformed just as well and took videos that looked just as good as those posted.We were going to Maui and I wanted .... just believed I NEEDED.... a camera that would take pictures under water. I did some research and this one seemed to be a good camera for the price. I haven't had much luck with Kodak cameras so it was with some hesitation that I ordered it. However, it was fantastic.This camera feels heavy. It feels like it is sturdy. This is also why the directions have the warning that the camera will sink. It is heavier than many digital cameras.Despite being heavy though it fit well in my hand. It was easy to use. The icons on the screen of the camera were easy to understand and the dials and buttons were very intuitive. There were enough bells to make me feel like I had my money's worth and not so many that it was difficult to remember how to operate the camera.For the cost this is probably the best option out there if you are looking for an underwater camera.Enjoy.", "My daughter LOVES this camera, ok pictures but great usability. She takes pics of her and her friends pulling gymnastics moves around our pool all summer long.", "If you are looking for a simple and cheap underwater camera this is the one for you. It takes great pictures underwater and also above water. My wife uses it quite a bit in the ocean here in Maui. You always should clean it in fresh water then let it dry completely before opening it. Yes the paint will flake off eventually, but that has no impact on it as far as taking pictures. It also takes great underwater videos with sound. Overall, a great starter camera for underwater photography.", "takes good pictures, but my snap button gets stuck sometimes. Works fine underwater, but i wish it came with a wrist strap seeing as i tend to use the waterproof camera when I know things are going to be hectic and messy", "I bought this for my boyfriend for a Christmas present and he LOVED it. We used it in the summer. The video and photos are perfect and the quality is unbelievable. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a pool. We even used it at the beach and it was still perfect!", "I have a dive camera that is good but too much trouble for day-to-day pool and kayak use.  I really wanted the Olympus TG-810 but didn't want another $400 camera.  Picked this up on a trial basis just based on price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took a bunch of pics in and around the pool and the quality was great.  It's really slow to recycle between shots but all pics were in focus and the colors wonderful.  Love that it has an auto white balance setting for underwater and I don't have to mess with filters.  Will be perfect for kayaking and snorkeling.", "\"This is exactly what I expected. But, the pictures posted here on amazon.com are quite superior to what you will usually get. That is why I am posting my own test pics to give some comparisons.I purchased this for my outdoor activities, right before the first trip to Grand Canyon for my novice companion. from day 1, I knew the picture quality was below average, not good enough for my grand trip. I decided to stop using it. And, when I returned, I brought it out to the beach(October heat wave, yay~!)near where I live.You will see the result of it. I cropped one or two pics, but, I did not use photoshop  and you can see the candid images I took.____________1. Location - The beach scene is done around 12-3pm on Sunny October daytime.-Underwater pics are not impressive and most of the time, out of focus, and these pics are slightly better ones.-Whenever you switch 'on' the camera, the setting goes back to 'AUTO\"\" mode, and, the difference of the 'Auto' and 'Vivid' are shown(very yellow-tinted with Vivid, on the sandy hill background)____________Although I don't show it here, the 'self-portraight pics' with flash light(Strong sun-shadow contrast) tend to be the best feature of C123 as the pic results are almost as good as the other one with manual flashlight settings.And, the pics taken from the car, with 40+m/h speed, was decent.____________2. The Video mode,You can also see that the digital zoom is real joke and you will hear my unsuccessful zoom out click attempt, just like woodpeckers. And, the sun gets in the lens and the image is simply dull.3. location - Boat docking area, Butterfly, and plant closeup scenes are taken from my walk, around 4-5:30pm, on the following day in October, 2011.-Although the good composition and the nice objects, Sunset make the images look rich often, as you can see, it often darkens the image, and less saturated color, and, most of the time, it is not true to your eyes greatly.4. Close-ups and evening scenes are no,no.And, you should expect greatly compromised with the result if you use it to take picture for the ordinary day life. Exposure is inconsistent. And, I could not get the result that I could get from other higher-end cameras.I instantly noticed the cheap price means, their processor is probably from mid- to late- 1990s. My first digital camera of 1.2mega pixel has the similar quality then.5. The 'blue metalic paint' peels off from the first beach day and the body is white plastic underneath it.____________In conclusion,With its price under $70, I can't be complaining as I can explore more of the 'in the water,' situations- not under the water, really- i get the different angles of the distant landscape, walking into the Sea, or braving heavy rain storm seasons-For Now.This Kodak C123 will be a great toy for the young kids or a decent expansive option for unusual weather situation.\"", "i used it in waterpark and it really takes great quality pictures.not too heavy and it is nice size.however, there is annoying time delay between pictures when you take pictures.so you have to wait 10 seconds between pictures.", "\"I've used my Kodak EasyShare Sport Camera Review for a full year now. So my review isn't a \"\"first time user\"\" review with first impressions. I have been using this camera solidly for a year. I have seen it in a variety of conditions. Here is my review of it.First, the basics. The camera is about the size of an average digital camera / smart phone, about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It is reasonably light, and has a rubber bumper on its front to keep the lens from getting too damaged by putting it down face-down accidentally. It is a 12mp camera and takes a standard SD memory card. It has a video mode and zoom.I love to kayak, so I am constantly taking this camera out with me in the water. I actively take photos underwater, to get shots of interesting seaweed and fish. It has NEVER had any problem, in all these months, with being underwater. There is a two-layer system of protection for the two AA batteries and memory card. So you close up one plastic flap, and once that is closed you seal the outer plastic flap. Once both are sealed, you're set. Yes, it can be a bit tricky to get the inner orange flap to seal, but of course it's worth it to pay attention to doing that properly. If you let water into the insides of the camera, it undoubtedly stops working.The camera does NOT FLOAT. I purchased a third party float for the camera since, being in a kayak, it's a reasonable assumption that things in the kayak might end up in the water. So if you're looking to use this camera in active water situations, I highly recommend getting a float for it.The camera is a bit slow in taking photos. I get spoiled with my many other digital cameras, that I can point, shoot, and go right on to the next picture. Here there's a good 2 second delay before it gets the picture into memory. I don't mind, the camera is fairly inexpensive for being an underwater camera. If I have to be patient, that is fine.Sometimes in a bright sun-on-lake situation, or in a dark underwater situation, the screen display doesn't give you a clear view of what you're trying to take a photo of. I guess the display isn't bright enough, or not anti-glare enough, or something. So in certain circumstances I have to point and guess.There is screwhole at the base for mounting this onto a tripod. I suppose you might need one if you were shooting Niagara Falls photos and didn't want to worry about the camera being destroyed by the spray.The camera comes with software, but while I tried it out a few times, I find it much easier just to dump the memory card contents onto my hard drive and work with them in PhotoShop.I have taken this camera all over the place and it's been a trooper. I don't tend to handle my equipment gently. The camera has held up to the abuse.Highly recommended.\"", "takes terrific pictures underwater on snorkeling and minor dives.  Also handy for beach use where the regular cameras are at risk.", "Got it hoping it will hold up under tough weather conditions.  Seems to be working well, easy to use.  But my 11yr old doesn't play w cameras as much as his older brother. I like using AA batteries instead of proprietary ones that need special recharging units to drag around.  We use rechargeable Eneloops in this and they are working fine but I can get AA's anywhere.  I'm a little bummed that Kodak is on the ropes so we bought the square Trade warranty just in case there is no Kodak to run to if/when we need help.  But so far working well. Nice size and nice price.  I like the bright color - easier to find under the couch, behind the TV or where ever an 11 yo &#34;loses&#34; it next.....", "I am a semi-professional photographer, and I understand that I cannot expect the same results from this as I get from the set up I use for work. Due the high cost of most dedicated cases ($500+ for our household camera, $2000+ for one of my work SLR's), we bought this camera solely for easy snapshots while kayaking at the lake. My expectations are not high for this sort of camera, and it manages to meet those expectations most of the time.  While it's great for the scrapbook shots,and perhaps printing 4x6's, expect to work harder and pay more attention to get some of those pictures.Pros:AA batteries.  I can't tell you how helpful this is, dealing with a proprietary battery out at the lake is an incredible pain in the neck.Simple button to turn off the flash. You need it with this camera, see the cons section.Simple button to adjust the exposure compensation.Large easy to see display. Even in the sun the display is easy to see.Splash proof - NOT waterproof.  One look at this thing and it's obvious it's going to take on water, too many exposed buttons.Small and rugged.Cons:Over exposes easily.  This camera will fire off the flash even in the slightest of shadows and as a result tends to make pictures a bit whited out.No lens cover.  Truly ridiculous, the camera is advertised for the water, why isn't there at least some kind of cheap cover to keep the water and fingerprints off the lens when your carrying it around?  The recessed lens makes it very difficult to clean the lens when it gets spots on it.Review time is fixed at 5 seconds.  Which means that you either have to shoot blind or wait those 5 seconds for the review to finish.  No buttons seem to make the camera kick back into the preview screen.No viewfinder.  I know this is the trend in most cameras, and I knew it didn't have one before ordering, but it really irritates the crap out of me.Factory float strap isn't a float strap.  I ordered the combo kit because it came with a float strap from the factory.  The assumption of course was that it would actually float the camera it came with, it doesn't.  Fortunately this is something I checked in a large bucket with an equal weight before going to the lake.Overall I would like to emphasize that this isn't too bad for a sub $70 camera.  If you want something that takes good pictures most every time, has a quick speed, is easy to get along with, and is water proof you need to at least move into the $200 range.  But if you don't expect too much you'll probably be satisfied.", "Picked this up for my son who was partaking in a lot of water based activities at summer camp.  Primarily chose it because it is waterproof and inexpensive.  It has certainly exceeded expectations.First off, this camera is indeed waterproof and has also proven itself to be pretty rugged.  The paint is now scuffed up in various places but it still functions as it should.  It has withstood being in the water, being on camping trips, and otherwise being abused in situations where you do not want to carry the digital SLR.Photo quality is very good.  Maybe not DSLR quality but much better than many portable digital cameras.  You would not use it for portrait sittings but for point and shoot it does well.I was concerned that it would eat through AA batteries but they seem to last for a reasonable long time.  I do not like the lack of a viewfinder but this is pretty common at this price point.While this would not be my first choice as a primary camera, for something that is light, portable, rugged, and waterproof, this is a definite buy.", "I must admit I was very hesitant to trust an underwater camera that was so much less expensive than most other point and clip models of similar capabilities however I am very surprised with the quality of the pictures it took, unfortunately the cameras cons are too great and I will be returning the camera.Pros:Low cost for waterproof camera.Good for amateur snorkelingHandled salt water wellPicture quality vs cost of camera.Cons:Extremely poor battery life, takes 2 AA batteries, I was only able to take 50+/- pictures depending on if the flash was used or not and than camera had to be washed with fresh water (using it in salt water) and dried well to change batteries, naturally that is not a convenient process when you are up current half a mile from your belongings and taking pictures of a school of fish or something else that may not be there if/when you return.Defaults to auto setting on power cycle (unit turns off after some idle time and resets mode to default, this is a problem if you forget to switch back to underwater mode when using the camera underwater)Exterior finish chipping: The camera comes in 3 different colors but in just two weeks of using the camera a large portion of the color has chipped off.", "but only could get it in Red. Took video and pictures on the beach. Really good shots. My daughter wants it now. She has not told me but you can just see it in the way she moves.", "[...]That sums up the usage of my camera.  Took it sailing for 7 days, 3 days of land travel, tons of underwater footage and it came out greatNo leaks, no issues.  Just high battery consumption of doubl a batteries.All pictures in video are in low res cause of vides but you can see the quality in pictures as well as vid.  I will be taking this with me every sunny trip I go on!Watch till the 12-13 min mark to see all pictures.", "\"UPDATE: Kodak's bankruptcy and exit from the digital camera business probably means that these cameras will be gone forever! I have the updated C135 in pre-order, but I'm not holding my breath. Amazon says it's 'unavailable,' but my account's order status has the C135 shipping in April. Who knows? All I know is that I'm glad I own a backup C123 in the box. The C135 is supposed to have digital stabilization, as opposed to no image stabilization in the C123 - but the C123 still takes great pics for its intended purpose.although it's more orange than red, i like my new c123... i carefully read every review, and although i can understand why some folks are disappointed, i am more than happy with this camera after playing with it, taking indoor, outdoor, and yes, even close-up shots!the controls are fairly intuitive, but i found that i had to set up the camera before it would take acceptable pictures (specifically, the 'sharp' selection under 'Sharpness' on the Capture menu; you may also want to manually select an ISO if you're going to be in the same lighting conditions for your picture session - see below)this camera works with my version of iPhoto on an older iMac, so i'm grateful - the kodak setup was fairly easy: plug in the camera, turn it on, install the resulting kodak.pkg from the Desktop, etc. ... i use 'Other Application' for the 'Computer Connection' item under the Setup menu...UPDATE: i have since found that there is no reason to use any Kodak software with my C123 and iPhoto, since iPhoto recognizes the C123 and imports pictures with no problems - and especially since i can (if i wish) send iPhoto pics straight to facebook if desired (something i rarely do)this camera's firmware is deceptively sophisticated, but honestly, these were all the initial settings i used...you *will* have to hold this camera steady! it does NOT have 'shake reduction' featured in most higher-end cameras...that said, anyone who knows photography knows that it's not the camera that makes the best pictures, but the photographer's eye (and to a degree, technique)i was a bit apprehensive about the lack of macro shots, but tried a 24\"\" flash pic of some stuff on my desk - the picture came out perfectly sharp and acceptable, considering this is an inexpensive camerai next tried to take pictures indoors, with no flash, use the digital zoom about a third out... first, i tried the 'Auto' ISO mode; next, i set the camera to ISO 80... carefully bracing the camera, i squeezed off one shot each of a stack of books about 20 feet away in the living room...the results were as i expected: the ISO 80 picture was noticeably 'sharper'... so there is a some manual control available to the picture taker...i have no intention of going snorkeling with this camera, but wanted something that will be impervious to dust, dirt, or sand at the beach - in this regard, this little kodak will fit the bill perfectly... it's compact, uses AAs, has simple controls, tripod socket, and accepts an SD or SDHC card (although it did not like my 16GB Adata, but worked fine w/a 4GB microSDHC in an SDHC carrier taken straight from my Canon A570is and stuck in - even the Canon's pictures showed up under the C123's preview! w00t!)five stars for this camera for me - i look forward to an improved model or firmware... i also recommend going to kodak's web site to get the 'extended c123 user guide' - there are more hints and tips in the manual\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.11041707545518875, 0.032742034643888474, 0.04687683284282684, 0.08051223307847977, 0.09727894514799118, 0.07042400538921356, 0.08577144145965576, 0.02191752754151821, 0.01860737055540085, 0.09873929619789124, 0.003173211356624961, 0.06261035799980164, 0.0008550420752726495, 0.11127099394798279, 0.0020600100979208946, 0.04688016697764397, 0.10918666422367096, 0.0003915201814379543, 0.0002853273181244731]]}
