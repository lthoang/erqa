If the web interface were better and instructions were clearer, it would go to 4 stars.", "The Runtastic GPS Sports Watch is fine for what it is supposed to do, but I strongly prefer Wahoo's wireless heart rate monitor paired with an iPhone using Runmeter.To start with, I charged the watch as the instructions warn you to do. It a very weird looking clamp connection, but it connected surprisingly easily and stayed connected. To save your results in any consumable format, you need to sync to your computer with a cable. It's not the end of the world, but the automatic syncing that the iPhone apps provide is so much easier.The watch takes a little effort to learn how to use the features, but it isn't any more complicated than a typical feature-rich watch. That means it is much less intuitive than an iPhone app.The big advantage of the watch compared to the iPhone option is how much easier it is to quickly access a wrist watch than iPhone controls, particularly with a password on the iPhone. I wish I could use a wrist watch to control Runmeter on the iPhone.I know some runners refuse to carry the extra (perceived) weight of a phone when they are running, so for them, the watch has another advantage. In that case, this Runtastic Watch is a good option for a reasonable price.", "I have been using a heart rate monitor that connects with Bluetooth to my IPhone. The program uses GPS tracking and mapping. I saw this GPS watch and heart rate monitor and was interested because sometimes I do not want to carry my phone in the armband for some of my workouts. I also do not like to take the phone if it looks like it will ran during my workouts. While this watch is not waterproof, it is water resistant so I would wear it for runs in the rain.The GPS feature tracks you while you run, or bike, or walk. Then when you get back to your computer you can upload the data and view your workout. Unlike the GPS program for my IPhone, if I get lost in the woods I am screwed. There is no screen to look at to see a GPS map on the watch. Not a huge problem, but when I am running new trails, or hitting the woods and going off-trail, I will just bring my phone. just in case.The watch uploads to the Runtastic website. You can use the basic features for free, or upgrade to the Gold package for a yearly fee. The basic package only has time, distance, average heart rate, max heart rate, and pace. You cannot look at your workout on a map. Kind of a bummer because I like to see where I ran on a map.The first couple of times I used this watch I could not get the GPS portion working. I contacted support and was less than thrilled by their lack of customer support skills. Luckily I was able to get the watch and GPS working on my own.", "Bottom line: This is a nicely designed runners/sports watch that is comfortable to wear and use. Controls are mainly straightforward. It provides the opportunity to extend functionality with online Runtastic services, but also works well as a standalone device.Full review: I'm fussy when it comes to exercise electronics in that I have limited patience for dealing with complex interfaces. The Runtastic has proven to be a decent device that is easy to use, but also offers extended capabilities with online services.The build quality is decent. It's (as expected) plastic, but the construction quality seems solid. The watch fits well and is comfortable to use while exercising. The chest band is a bit less comfortable and cut into my skin when it was strapped tightly enough to make good contact. But, not any more uncomfortable than other chest bands I've used. (Still waiting for someone to come up with a chest band design that makes good contact but you don't even know you are wearing it.) It feels very similar to the Polar strap I have, which - and this is a total guess on my part - may be who makes the hardware.The watch control buttons are nicely sized and contoured. I found them easy to push even when in motion. The display is clear, has large lettering (something my aging eyes appreciate!) and has decent full-sunlight visibility. It includes a bike mount.The included instructions are just OK. A bit hard to read and it could have been better organized and written, but it gets the info across that you need to know to use the watch. I was hoping to find better instructions online, but so far I've not found any on their site.Runtastic made its name by developing exercise apps, so it's no surprise that this has online capabilities that allow you to share your results, plot progress, and other such features. I'm not a huge fan of that, but it's not a mandatory feature - you can use these devices standalone even if you're not into sharing results or uploading data.Performance has been very good. The heart rate monitor works well provided there's good sensor-to-skin contact (moisture helps, as does sensor contact gel). I can't give it a laboratory-level accuracy assessment but, it appears accurate. I didn't have any problems with signal issues even when I used it in the gym with many other wireless monitoring devices in use.The GPS capabilities do not appear to be as well-done as the Garmin Forerunner. It had problems initially capturing a signal at first in an area that didn't present a problem for the Garmin. But, once acquired, the signal stayed locked.The claimed battery life is 16 hours, which is pretty close to what I got. It uses a USB cable to recharge (which is included). The heart rate strap uses a flat cell battery that is user-replaceable.If you are a Runtastic app fan, this is something that will be appealing since you can benefit from the features without having to take a phone. But even for people such as myself, who don't use exercise apps much, the hardware alone provides good functionality at a nice price point. Definitely should be on the short list when shopping for a sports watch.", "Before a recent injury I was doing at least 5 miles a day, but always old school.  I had a regular watch and hadn't bought into the need for a GPS for my running.  I drove around to map my route and had that down.  Why did I need anything else?  But I gave this watch a try.The first thing I got with the Runtastic GPS was a new freedom.  The first day I took a detour from my regular route and added some extra distance.  That was nice because I could see how far I went even when I didn't stick to my mapped roads.  Also the heart rate monitor was a big benefit.  Not at first but after my third run or so I could start seeing a pattern.  After using the heart rate monitor a dozen or more days now I'm starting to see a pattern.And with my foot injury this added information has been a huge benefit.  I've spoken to my doctor about the heart rates and with her help am able to start working to bring that down as well.  Nothing to worry about but it's extremely helpful to know what it is.  And if I did have a problem I wouldn't have known that before.Some of the watches that I've seen at stores look bulky and was one of the reason I didn't purchase another model.  But this Runtastic looks just like any other watch.  And when I'm not running I do use it as a watch.  The only thing I don't use is the compass but I might if I were trail running and got lost.  It's nice to have in an emergency.Overall I've been very pleased and now wishing I'd gotten a GPS Sports Watch earlier.  At least I have one now.", "\"I own theGarmin Forerunner 110, a GPS sports watch that has set the standard as to what this type of watch should do.  I've been poring over the differences and frankly, I think that Runtastic is going to give Garmin a run for the money.  Pun intended.  A lot of people are familiar with Runtastic via their apps:  Runtastic, Runtastic Road Bike, Walktastic, Runtastic Pedometer, Runtastic Mountain Bike, and Runtastic Winter Sports.  Each watch can be set up to record data via Garmin Connect or Runtastic Connect.  If you are working toward a particular goal like hitting that five minute mile you can check your progress and do things such as check out your route.There is a quick start guide included in the box, but you can find a 60-page manual online.  I'll put the link in the comments section.  When you have a cold start it's going to take a minute or more for satellite connection, but a warm start will get you up and running very quickly.  There are a few differences between the watches, but depending on what you want, things seem to equal out here.  The Garmin can be immersed in water while the Runtastic is only splash resistant.  If you're training for the Spartan Beast and are immersing yourself in a river to challenge yourself you might opt for the Garmin.  If you are a runner the choice is yours.The Runtastic has a compass and the Garmin doesn't.  Planning on working on your survivalist tactics, you might want the Runtastic if you're heading out into unknown terrain.  Bikers will be thrilled to note that the Runtastic comes with bike support.  When I did a quick review of the Garmin, I said something like it was as good as it gets.  Perhaps I spoke a bit too soon.  Price wise, this watch is less expensive.  Only time will tell as to how well this one performs over a longer period of time.  Using the Runtastic, playing with it, poring over the specs ... some advantages over the Garmin, a few detractors, but overall this is an awesome watch for the money.  I do think Garmin has a competitor.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  GPS Watch~  Sensor~  Chest Strap~  USB cable~  Bike Support (includes 2 cable clamps and 1 installing plate)~  Quick start guideCHARGING:Both the Garmin and Runtastic can be charged by plugging a USB cable into an AC adapter and plugging into a wall outlet.OS COMPATIBILITY:Garmin:  Windows/MacRuntastic:  Windows/MacBATTERY TYPE:Garmin:  200 mAh rechargeable, lithium-ion, coin-cell batteryRuntastic:  Lithium-polymer accumulator, 380 mAh, 3.7VBATTERY LIFE:Garmin:  Rechargeable, dependant on how much you use it.

Before investing in a $300 unit, I'd suggest this Runtastic. My sister dropped $300+ for a Garmin only to find that she doesn't like the scientific approach to running. She doesn't like concerning herself with numbers, graphs and tracking. She likes to freely run, not analyze graphs or keep checking her stats. You don't need one to train competitively. So, if you're unsure, I can't think of a better GPS-HRM watch than this one. Gives you what you need, but won't break the bank. That said, it's capable for more advanced runners, too.It has more goodies than a similarly-priced Garmin plus it has bike mounting, compass & better warranty. The quality is far superior to anything Polar has ever put out and it can easily front as a daily driver.Good quality & easy to read. The GPS locks quickly and is pretty accurate. The online site is decent. Not as robust as Garmin's offering w/o paying a fee. Not too keen on that, but if your a novice, you probably won't use all the bells & whistles for a while anyhow.Peeves? It only comes w/a USB charger, so you'll need a free or spare USB/plug converter if you're not near your computer. When I plugged it into my computer, there was some unnecessary drama in downloading a driver. I had to Google & search for it. Also, I wish there was a level indicator of charge strength, so I'll know if it's charged enough for a run. Finally, customer service is absolutely horrible. It's non-existant.Although my Garmin 410 has more goodies, I find the Garmin much easier to understand and operate. I thought I could just figure it out on the run, but I had to go home and read a bit before taking the Runtastic out. It's not as intuitive. I still haven't figured out why, after a random time & with no pre-programming, the watch beeps. Everything my Garmin does makes sense to me. Maybe it's just me. Unfortunately, customer service doesn't exist.Once you enroll on their site, your inbox will be BLOWN UP. I don't want a community or penpal. I want a GPS-HRM device. Leave... me... alone, Runtastic. I had to uncheck email options I never checked in the first place so that I wouldn't get 2 emails every day. ..but Runtastic continues to find new reasons to contact me & remind me of its presence.In the end, it's a great piece. I didn't expect such an impressive package for such a reasonable price. I do wish it was more intuitive, or at least it came w/good customer service. Runtastic is way too intrusive with emails. This, alone, has me using my other unit a lot more. ...and really makes me wanna give it 3 stars, but it's a nice, well-priced unit that works well, so a solid *4* for Runtastic's first GPS-HRM offering.", "The Runtastic watch is amazingly small for a GPS watch; it makes my oldForerunner 305look positively massive, and it even seems a little smaller than the sleekNike+ SportWatch.It comes bundled with a chest strap, a simple bike mount and a USB data+charge clip.It's loaded with features: GPS, of course, but also A-GPS which relies on assistive data the Runtastic Connect app automatically downloads and pushes to your watch (the data is valid for 7 days). A compass. Navigation with waypoint collection. And all the bells and whistles you'd expect on a regular sports watch.The app is available for PC and Mac (I use the Mac version, but the PC version is very similar -- it is mostly used to exchange data with the watch and upload results to the Runtastic web site). The USB cable features a spring-loaded clamp with gold pins which connect with tiny gold pads on the underside of the watch; to connect and charge the watch, you just clip it. It's not a bad system, and an improvement over the Garmin cradle which does not properly grip the watch. However, it's another easy to lose part, and it's hard to beat the clever Nike+ built-in USB connector.PROS----- AMAZING battery life. 8 hours GPS, and ONE WHOLE YEAR as a watch. This is by far the most miserly device I've used in a long time!- A-GPS- Navigation feature with waypoint collection, very useful for long hikes- Compass (surprisingly accurate)CONS------ Complex user interface, hard to figure out without the manual- Display is outdated and uses ugly, hard to read fonts- Weak backlight with very limited viewing anglesCONCLUSION-----------Is this watch for you? If you're already a Runtastic user, absolutely! It's a vast improvement in accuracy and convenience over using your phone. If you're not, I wouldn't be so enthusiastic. There are many competing products on the market, and I find the cumbersome user interface, poor backlight, Runtastic tie-in and constant upsell nagging to be issues significant enough to not give this watch more than an average three stars.For hikers and/or Runtastic subscribers, the amazing battery life and Runtastic integration make it a solid four star product. I would like to see Runtastic make significant improvements to the display in future firmware upgrades.", "I was disappointed when I dropped two hundred bucks on my latest Garmin GPS Sports watch after my last one fell off during a marathon. First, it had some weird touch-screen on it, but worst of all, it required having a master's degree in rocket science or something like that to get it to work. Not intuitive at all!!I had never heard of the Runtastic brand, and was a little hesitant, but decided to give it a shot anyway, especially after seeing it had several add-ons that I thought were mainly exclusive to brands like Garmin, like the Cadence counter and bike mount. The battery life is great, which is something else that makes it beat out my new Garmin which died three quarters of the way through a triathlon. In watch mode, this is supposed to last up to a year, but to be honest I'm not big on the look by itself and use it for its GPS functionality mainly.Looking at the data on this watch is easy and intuitive, and the watch itself costs less than the Garmin. Bottom line: I've bought my last Garmin, unless they can heavily improve to this watch's standard and reduce their price. I know, very unlikely.If you are looking for a GPS watch and aren't 100% committed to picking up a Garmin, give this watch some good consideration. Plus, stand out a little bit, since 95% of the GPS watches everybody has is a Garmin.", "I've used GPSs even before they had maps, just had directional arrows.  I have also used heart monitors for over twenty years.  This is the first time I've used a device that combines the two.  My impressionsHeart Monitor -  The heart monitor was accurate compared to a manually measured pulse.  It seems to measure well even when exercising.  The chest band is similar to others I have used.  You can configure various zones and set alarms, similar to most MR monitors.  When you insert the battery there is a little clip it needs to go under so be watchful of that when you install a battery.GPS - It seems pretty sensitive.  I actually got a pretty good signal inside my house.  There seems to be a significant delay in updating some GPS information though.  For example, if I am moving and come to a dead stop.  It takes a good 5 seconds or more before MPH changes to zero.  Not as quick as other GPS devices I have but good enough for an exercise watch.  You can set waypoints and it will calculate an ETA. The altitude was accurate when compared to other sources. It also has a compass mode which uses an electronic compass that is not GPS basedThe watch is typical of heart monitor watches.  Functional, but not very attractive.  It's fine for exercising though.  It recharges using the proprietary USB computer connection that clips on.The manual is one sheet of paper. It has enough information to use the device but is incomplete.  There's a symbol on my screen and I have no idea what it means and the instructions do not say.  As seems to be the trend now, you have to go online to see the real manual.Software - It took me a while to find the Windows software for the watch on their website.  I found the website  poorly laid out. I had to install the software  a couple of times before it finally allowed the watch to connect to the PC. It works fine now though.  The workout portion of the website is very complete and provides all kinds of information about your workout including a map, elevation change, heart rate, speed information etc.  I think they did a good job on this part of the website.  It has just about everything you need and you can share information with friends. You can sync with their phone apps.  However, this is the catch.  To get all of these online features you have to pay $35 per year. (you can get a discount if you buy within the first 20 days you register)  You can still use the website for free but features are very limited.Overall this is a very good, reasonably priced sports watch.  Although it's not cheap, it seems less expensive than similar GPS/HR watches.  The annual fee seems pricey but if you are serious about using this and an avid runner or cyclist, it may be worth it.", "I have been using aGarmin Forerunner 110 GPS-Enabled Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor (Pink)for the past year.  I run several times a week, and at stretches up to 2 hours in half-marathon training.  I've had the Forerunner replaced under warranty, but have had a pretty good experience with it.This Runtastic watch is the same basic idea, and generally performs well.  In side-by-side tests, it shows distances within a couple hundredths of a mile compared to the Forerunner.  Since I'm not hard-core, I'm perfectly fine with that accuracy.The laps can be set in tenths up to 6.2 miles.  I was disappointed not to find 0.25 miles (quarter mile) laps as an option, as this is my preferred setting.The menu navigation is easy. I didn't need to read the manual to figure out how to set it up or search the history of past runs.It finds satellites quickly, even in a different location than the previous run.One problem was with the battery life.  The Garmin unit has a power save feature, whereby the GPS turns off after a few minutes not in use.  This saves the battery life.  The Runtastic must have the GPS manually turned off, or else the battery is completely dead within a few hours.  Not impossible to do, of course, but incredibly inconvenient to have to remember to do that (when other watches have a power save feature standard).  Overall, the battery lasts less than a week, even when not using the GPS other than for runs.Overall, not a bad GPS watch unit for running (though I personally prefer my Forerunner).", "I have several heart rate monitors and I prefer one with a chest strap for accuracy.  The latest device I have been using is a My Zone unit my gym was promoting, I also have a Polar and an Omron that is only for walking and running. I am very happy to be using this Runtastic product that I was unfamiliar with prior to this review unit.  It was easy to get to the settings and get the watch programmed and it is easy to upload information for tracking.  The watch is easy to read and since I am a spinner I love the bike attachment.  The main reason I dislike my Polar is one another reviewer mentioned, I cannot see it during a workout since I wear glasses for close work.  Also, the Polar charges a lot extra for the computer tracking.  The Runtastic chest strap is designed differently from others I have used and this design makes caring for the unit easier than the usual snap on disk.  With the Runtastic the monitor is on a section of strap that attaches to a longer section making cleaning the long strap a chinch.  I have not needed the GPS but it is really nice to have this feature. The unit has worked nicely for me and I am so glad to have a unit that is designed for biking as well as other activities.  It is a great value for the money.", "The runtastic GPS watch is a good entry level watch with a heart rate monitor that is less expensive than the Garmin GPS watches.  I also own theGarmin Forerunner 405 Wireless GPS-Enabled Sport Watch with USB ANT Stick and Heart Rate Monitor (Black)which I have been using for several years and so I have compared the Garmin watch versus the runtastic watch as part of this review.  The runtastic watch has a lot of nice features.  However, I found it to be less accurate than my Garmin watch.  Neither watch was perfect, but the runtastic watch was half as accurate as the Garmin watch and that will matter to someone who really wants to keep close track of their distances.  I also really didnt like the online experience with the news feed of workouts of people I dont know and the default privacy settings of sharing all of my information.  Overall I found the runtastic watch to be good, but not great in comparison to the Garmin watch.Whats in the box?When your runtastic watch arrives in its box, you will find the GPS watch, a heart rate monitor, a USB cable for downloading data and for charging the watch and a bike support for mounting the watch to your handlebars.  The handlebar mount is a nice touch but I was disappointed that only a USB cable was included and not an adapter so that the watch could be plugged into a wall outlet to charge.StyleThe runtastic watch has a square face with a reflective rim around the face.  The rest of the watch is black.  The watch could be worn as an everyday watch, especially so since it offers other features such as dual time zones, alarm and timer.  However, the reflective silver rim around the watch face gives it a bit of a cheap look and I would have preferred if runtastic had left the whole watch black.  In terms of size, the runtastic watch is slightly bigger than the Garmin 405Cx, but it is also noticeably heavier than the Garmin watch.ControlsThe runtastic watch has five buttons on the sides that allow you to move between menus, to turn on the light and to start and stop the activity tracing.  To access certain menus, you need to hold down the mode button for several seconds.  The buttons on the right are used for toggling between options and the blue, view button is used to select.  While the numerous buttons are levels are functional, I prefer the simplicity of the Garmin controls which use a touch sensitive band around the watch face.DisplayThe display that you see on the watch while you are recording a workout has three data fields that are customizable.  The downloadable manual for the watch states that you can find more information about customizing the fields in section (###).  The (###) is actually how the manual reads.  It is ridiculous in my mind that no one at runtastic has bothered to actually insert the correct section number.  When I did try to customize the fields using the watch menus, I found several German words such as laufen, radfahrer, wandern.  It is again ridiculous that this was not corrected by runtastic to show the words running, cycling and hiking in English.  However, what I did really like is that you can customize the display through the runtastic Connect program you install on your computer to communicate with the watch.  I have included a screen shot of this feature.ChargingBoth watches are charged by attaching a clip to the watches.  The clip goes over the face of the watch and the runtastic version has a rubber mount so that you dont damage the watch face.  However, the Garmin 405Cx includes a adapter so that you can charge from a wall outlet.  The runtastic does not have an adapter and so is designed to plug into the USB port of a computer for charging.  I prefer to be able to plug the watch into the wall outlet so that I can just plug it in when needed without first needing to boot up my computer.  Both watches have battery meters with the runtastic showing the number of hours of use remaining while the Garmin shows the % battery remaining.Satellite ReceptionStanding in my back yard on both sunny and cloudy days with the watches and a stopwatch, I found that the Garmin watch locked onto the satellites faster than the runtastic watch, but only by twenty seconds or so.  While the Garmin watch allows you to see the number of satellites which have been found so that you can see the progress, the runtastic watch shows only that it is locked or that it is not locked to satellites.AccuracyTo compare the accuracy of the runtastic and the Garmin watches, I wore them both and held aGarmin GPSMAP 60Cx Handheld GPS Navigatorin my hand for several days while running.  The Garmin 60Cx is a larger, dedicated GPS device and due to its big antennae, I consider it to be the more accurate than either of the wristwatch GPS's.  Over the course of several runs in areas without a lot of tree cover or high buildings, I found that both the runtastic watch and the Garmin 405Cx recorded less distance than the big, Garmin 60Cx.  On average, the runtastic watch was inaccurate by 0.04 miles per mile travelled and the Garmin 405Cx was inaccurate by 0.02 miles per mile travelled.  This means that if you run 10 miles, the runtatic watch will only record 9.8 miles run.  While neither watch was perfect, the runtastic watch was twice as inaccurate as the Garmin 405Cx.Heart Rate MonitorBoth heart rate monitors include a band of plastic that goes across your chest and is connected to a elastic, nylon band that is attached to the plastic band by two clasps.  The Garmin heart rate monitor (HRM) is thinner than the runtastic version.  The material that makes up the clasps of the Garmin HRM are rigid plastic which means that they are not pliable.  You just insert one end into an opening and snap it into place.  On the other hand, the runtastic HRM clasps are soft plastic.  Once one end is inserted into an opening, you need to press here and there to make sure that the clasp is fully engaged and nothing is sticking up.  I prefer the design of the Garmin heart rate monitor.Water resistanceThe Garmin 405CX is submersible down to 1m.  That means that I dont have to worry about getting it wet when I am training in the rain.  The runtastic watch is rain and splash resistant, but the manual advises that the watch be dried thoroughly before touching any button as water can enter the base through the buttons.  This could be a problem if you wear the watch in the rain and you want to push the stop button at the end of your workout.FeedbackWhat I think that the runtastic watch does better than the Garmin watch is feedback.  The runtastic watch shows you through runtastic Connect how much memory is occupied with saved workouts.  The battery meter shows the level not in percent, but in number of projected hours remaining.  This type of feedback makes it easier to judge when you will need to charge your watch so that you can plan ahead to do it the night before a long run or bike ride.Data TransferTo transfer data, you must attach the included USB clip to the runtastic watch and plug the other end into a USB port.  Data transfer from the Garmin 405Cx is done wirelessly.  You plug the included ANT Stick into a USB port and it transfers the data to Garmin.com automatically once the Garmin watch is detected.  The wireless transfer may reduce the battery life of the Garmin watch, but it is slicker to use.OnlineYou need to create an account through the runtastic website.  You are given the option of upgrading to a gold account which offers more features such as an ad free experience online in exchange for a yearly fee.  What I really did not like is that when you login, there is a feed on the right showing images of people and what they are doing with blurbs urging you to cheer them on.  I have included a screen shot of the website.  Think facebook feed and you have the idea.  The Garmin site has none of this and is focused on you and your workouts rather than what lots of people you dont know are doing.  I also didnt like that by default you are sharing all of your information with everyone.  That is probably why there are so much activity in the feed since by default everyone is sharing.  All of this is a shame because I think that otherwise, the runtastic online information is better than that shown on the Garmin site.  What I especially liked is that you can hover your mouse over one chart and your location on the map at that moment in time in your workout is noted as well.AnnoyancesDuring one of my first runs with the watch, it must have been pressing against my Garmin watch on the same wrist and the watch began beeping.  Every five seconds.  For the whole long run.  I tried to figure out how to stop the beeping but I didnt go too far since I was evaluating the accuracy and didnt want to affect that by pressing the wrong button.  So once home, I went through the settings and even downloaded the manual and thought I had it sorted.  But, the next run it was beeping again.  Fortunately, you can reset the watch to factory settings, but that meant that I had to reconfigure the watch settings.AccessoriesThe Garmin 405CX allows you to purchase accessories to improve your experience such as theGarmin Foot Pod [Retail Packaging] to track your cadence or to track your workouts if you use a treadmill.  The Runtastic watch does not have such an option.SummaryOverall, the runtastic is a good GPS watch.  It has a lot of features including the heart rate monitor at a lower cost than the Garmin watches.  However, you do get what you pay for.  The runtastic is a good entry level watch with some problems such as the accuracy.  That it is not waterproof is one problem if you run in the rain and the online experience is another problem in my mind.  So if you want more out of your GPS watch than the basics, I would recommend looking at the Garmin watches instead.Pros* With all of the features such as a stopwatch and an alarm, the watch could serve as a watch, not just as a GPS watch.* Good feedback such as the number of hours left on the battery and the % of the memory used for storing past workout data.* Cost* The included bicycle mountCons* No plug for a wall outlet, only USB* The runtastic web site is invasive with the default privacy settings and the live feed of random people is annoying.* Accuracy is half that of the Garmin watch* Not waterproof and the manual advises against using the buttons if wet which means that you cant start or stop the activity tracker if you are out in the rain.*  The poor product manual* The mix of German and English in the watch menus", "I got this to allow me to monitor my heart rate during exercise and it works well for that. I am used to using MapMyRide with an iPhone so there is a bit of a learning curve and I have not set up all the GPS features yet. I'll post an update once I activate those features.", "I must admit, I've never heard of this brand before, but I am pleasantly surprised. Having used various brands in the past, including Polar, I have some insight.The first thing I noticed is that the display is clear and large. I have a Polar FT7 and the numbers on the display are too tiny! Not so with the Runtastic. Anyone with reasonable vision should be able to see the display.The buttons are large and easy to press, even with one hand.Holds the heart rate signal well (but have not tested it in the gym where interference can be a problem with some heart rate monitors). I have had heart rate monitors that would just go blank for a few seconds then come back. Of-course some of this depends on the moisture of the skin at the point of contact of the chest sensor. I did not need to moisten my skin at all, to get an uninterrupted signal to the watch.Plenty of settings. You can save your lap times and associated info. There is a website to upload your stored info.Comes with a bike-handlebar attachment for use with a bicycle.There are alerts to sound if you are out of your heart rate range. The beeps are reasonably loud.It takes your body weight/age/sex info to come up with an automatic range of acceptable heart rate zones or you can customize your own.The watch strap should accommodate, both males and females.It has a cool compass to show which direction you are headed.Estimates calories burned.The strap is comfortable and high quality. It does not slip down.The unit has a lithium-ion battery and must be charged. You get 16 hrs max if using the GPS. I suspect more if you shut off the GPS. Charging is easy. You just clip the included USB charger to the face of the Runtastic and connect the other end into a USP port on your computer or a USB wall charger (wall charger not included). Charge time is about 3 hours. The unit came charged.I have not tested the GPS function as of yet, but it should be pretty cool to see exactly how far I've run/walked.I recommend the Runtastic.", "\"I see lots of great in-depth reviews, so I'll hit on a few \"\"superficial\"\" points that may not be clear from other reviews or from the photos.The watch is built well. Not Omega/Rolex quality, but like a solid Timex or Casio. I was afraid the silver bezel would be some kind of cheap painted plastic but it appears to be stainless steel.The watch is as handsome in-person as it appears in the photo. By that, I mean, if it looks good to you in the photo, you won't be disappointed. I think it's nice enough to wear even when I'm not running or biking. But I will say, it's a bit thick, but no worse than any other GPS watch I've seen.The strap buckles easily because the strap is pre-curved.Operation is easy. If you can work a Timex, you can work this watch.The battery charging clip is clever. It delights the enginerd in me. However, the exposed contacts may corrode after repeated use. I sweat a lot under the band. I'll amend this review if I see that happen.But so far, so good. I really like this watch.\"", "\"Watch 3 1/2 starsChest strap 4 1/2 starsLet me just get this out of the way... I love this chest strap. It is far and away my favorite. I've had about a half dozen monitors over the years, and this is the only one that I can just wear, and not be in a rush to take the damn thing off.As far as the watch goes, it's a lot of hit and miss for me.I had, for years, said if I could just integrate \"\"everything\"\" into my phone, I'd be happy. But once I did with the polar H7, I found it too much of a pain. A watch is just easier to glance at (no need to keep turning on the screen), and the battery life is much better on the watch.I also like the fact that I can keep a very accurate gauge on my pace, without having to run around a track.Also, I found the light to be just right, and very clear. And finally, I had zero pairing issues.What I'm not crazy about is the interface. I mean... I could find everything, but there were so many steps to do every little thing. Once you get used to a smartphone interface, it's hard to go back to something as clunky as this.And I would love to be able to just read my HR, without having to start up the stopwatch.I was fairly pleased with the runtastic web interface. Nothing too special, just easy to read, and everything you want to see.I would, despite the lack of decent interface, suggest this as a good watch for someone looking for a GPS/HR monitor.\"", "\"Let me start with an apparent idea that a simple Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor for $60 combined with an average smartphone can provide more functionality than any GPS-enabled watch.Actually, with this exact thought I put my new Runtastic GPS watch onto my wrist as I was preparing to start my little mountain hike a week ago. After two hours of hiking my skepticism disappeared and I realized that having a light smart device on my wrist has a lot of benefits comparing to other solutions.First, I was able to regulate pace to maintain steady heart rate, second, I had altitude, speed, time and even calories burned  readily available at any moment, third, I recorded way-points every time I stopped to rest, so I could always find my way back in any circumstances. GPS receiver worked flawlessly and accurately.Also, 16 hours of GPS navigation and weeks in watch mode make this watch suitable for three days hike.The  \"\"plastic band\"\" heart monitor sensor is slim and comfortable and it fits lot better than standard \"\"brick on a rubber band\"\" models. It is also lot easier to clean.As I returned home and connected my watch to the computer I was able to get a lot of exciting details about my hike from Runtastic web site, including full track (Google Map, recorded at 4 second intervals), my way points, time/speed/elevation graphs etc etc.Actually it should be mentioned that Runtastic watch is essentially a terminal to the skillfully designed  Runtastic web site and it is not so useful as a standalone device. Also I am not big fan to share my routes,  calories and/or heart rates, but Runtastic also allows you to be social here if you wish.Two days after the hike I used new watch for routine gym exercise. Well, without need for GPS functionality Runtastic watch is on par with cheaper heart monitor watches, though it measures calories better. Unlike typical \"\"runners\"\" watch, Runtastic offers multiple modes for calories counting, depending on activity. Another real benefit is ability to download training session information back to website for review and historical analysis.In my opinion this device is very useful if you hike, bike or run often. (Have I mentioned that bike mount is included?) It is less useful if your normal exercises are \"\"stationary\"\".Some other things that are worth mentioning:- read the instructions *before* you use this product; yes, you can figure out most of the functionality, but some useful functions are not obvious (hint: try to figure out how to set a way-point)- go to Runtastic web site mentioned in instructions *before* you try to connect watch to the computer - that save you ton of frustration when Windows cannot find a suitable driver- you need to register an account with Runtastic to download and keep exercise information; the basic account is free, premium service is $25/year- watch is not waterproof, only water-resistant; rain is OK but swimming is not.\""], "Gamma": [0.05293846130371094, 0.05293765291571617, 0.05293846130371094,
