"], "reviews": ["We have always been a fan of LeapFrog and our kids have gotten a lot of use out of their Leapster Explorers.  The games are hit and miss, like most video games, but all in all pretty decent.We recently received the GS (as well as a LeapPad) via Amazon Vine.  My kids LOVE the GS.  The built in games make it so much more useful than the older Leapster Explorers.PROS+ Sleeker design, easier to hold+ Many more included apps (Escape of the Sillies, Splurgle, etc.)+ Integrated, built in camera, video recorder & microphone are fantastic; built in game shows off its capabilities (Splurgle! and Escape of the Sillies)+ Cartridges from Explorer work (backwards compatible)+ Don't think the screen is any better resolution, but it is plenty good enoughCons:- Screen is only marginally bigger- Wish it was rechargeable... thinking of switching to rechargeable batteries.- Computer connection is very unreliable, but you can still use it without getting the connecton to work(I have an email into support about that)All in all, very pleased.", "\"We first got the original Leapster Explorer and then the LeapPad.  Both of those are great.  This LeapsterGS is sort of a hybrid between both.  It's shaped and styled like the original explorer, but adds camera and video capabilities.  It's solid and intuitive for kids to use.  BEST of all, the same cartridges for games work on all three Leapfrog games.  So, if you spend $25 on one game for your original Explorer, you'll be able to use it on the GS AND the Leappad.  That's very cool.  And the way the cartridges work, it's easy to change games and start playing.However, it should be noted there's about a $30 difference between this GS and the LeapPad.  For my money, I'd bump up to the LeapPad.  Bigger screen, easier to change batteries, and more possibilities for game use.  Otherwise, you won't be disappointed with this game.  Be sure to get the AC adaptor...these things eat batteries like crazy.My only big gripe is the box promises more than it delivers.  It clearly states \"\"a library of 300 games\"\".  Oh.  Sounds good, except that the 'library' isn't included, you'll pay for each and every one.  Only 3 \"\"apps\"\" are included, and \"\"apps\"\" are not full games.  They are short little practice games and/or Ebooks (snooze). An \"\"app\"\" usually runs $20 for two codes (two games or ebooks). So, it'll come with enough for your kid to play with for about a day before you are online looking for the game cartridges (which range from $17 sale to $30).  Also, the \"\"apps\"\" are not as easy to install, you have to enter a code via your LeapWorld connection online (installation takes forever!) and then download the app to your game via syncing cable.  Not a  problem after the first few times, but not as simple as the cartridge.One great thing about the syncing though is that the Leap toy reports back a report card to your LeapWorld account and keeps tracks of your child's strengths and weaknesses in math, reading, recognition, and problem solving.  They can also earn points from playing educational games, and when you sync they can \"\"buy\"\" additional little perks with those points.Altogether, I've been seriously impressed with all the Leapfrog products (except Tag...hate it) and while the games seem expensive, we've gotten our moneys worth out of all of them in the long haul.  We usually buy a new game before a big trip to occupy him during car time.  And for what it's worth, Tangled and Scooby Doo and NFL Rush are the LEAST fun of the games.  Star Wars, Wolverine, Ben 10, and Cars 2 have been the favorite games for our 5 year old.I hope you find this helpful.\"", "My kids have had their original Leapster for about four years now.  It's a little battered but frequently played with and much loved.  We noticed a few months ago that all of the games were being clearanced out, and that Leap Frog is replacing that model with this updated version.  We decided to switch over to this model, especially since the games are interchangeable with the Leap Pad.Things we love:  The screen is a little bigger and MUCH more crisp and clear.  While the battery draw is a little more than our regular Leapster, I think it's well worth it for the clarity and brightness on this screen.  We've purchased a few of the same games we had with the original system, and the difference in the screen is startling.  The shape is different too, and seems easier for my son to hold.  The buttons are very easy to reach and manipulate, and we've had no issues with freezing or non-responsiveness from the unit.  As with most Leap Frog items we've purchased, the educational content is great.  My son has been practicing his handwriting with the Pet Pal game, and it's made homework a whole lot easier and less frustrating for both of us.  He also loves to play this, and I like that he's getting some math, science and language building in with the game play.  I also like that I can connect this to the Leap Frog site and download directly onto his Leapster.  The cartridges are a big change from the original Leapster - they are TINY and very easy to lose, and also do not come with a plastic game case like the originals did.  My son says his favorite part is the art studio - he's taken so many self-portraits and added neat little graphics - it's a great program!Things we don't like:  Connecting this the first time was a huge pain.  We went through Leap Frog's instructions for the firewall and after 15 minutes of struggling through and being told there was no Explorer connected, we finally disabled the firewall entirely - it worked instantly.  Leap Frog said this was not a necessary step, but in our case it was.  As above, I'm not a huge fan of the tiny cartridges, but I like that you can download games directly onto the unit as well.Overall, we've very happy with the Explorer, and I would highly recommend it!", "My 5-year-old daughter has one of the original Leapster Explorers, and she loves it. However, we've always had a few quibbles with it - it's pretty thick, especially for smaller hands. The camera that is not built in, and instead extends outwards of the body. The fact that the stylus extends out from the body as well, even when put away. And the terrible delay on the camera. None of which were ever considered deal-breakers, just things that it would be nice if they were different. Then we got the GS.LOVE it. It's much more streamlined - in fact, it's very similar in build to a Sony PSP. It's quite a bit thinner, and definitely longer - easier for hands of all shapes and sizes to hold on to. The processing speed is quite a bit faster - there is a distinct difference in booting time, as well as how things move within the games themselves. And the stylus tucks in cleanly when not in use, rather than sticking out.The camera is now built into the body of the GS, making for fewer issues overall. In addition, there is significantly less delay when actually taking pictures. I'm sure every parent can relate to the photos we used to get - the shutter would click, and she would move along, not realizing that it hadn't actually taken the picture yet - a lot of very blurry photos tended to be the overall result. No more! When the shutter clicks (within a second), the photo is taken.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with this version of the Explorer. It's a definite improvement overall. I'm also quite pleased that they have AC adapters and recharger packs for this version, as batteries get very expensive and we can't keep enough rechargeable batteries in stock! LeapFrog has once again gone the extra mile and made it worth while to get the upgrade with all the newer, better features!", "Leapster Explorer GS is an electronic toy with a huge level of appeal for kids. Much more than just an electronic game playing device, this product has a camera and photo lab where kids can change photos to make them silly along with all sorts of downloadable applications, games, and books.Leapster Explorer GS is a great toy for several reasons and first among them has to be its education value. The applications are not just simple minded, no- thought- involved games and videos. No, the offerings here are educational in nature and are meant to teach kids how to think, use proper judgment, and work things out as well as teaching basic skills like math and other things. And probably the best part is that kids love it. They love the fun they have so much that they don't even realize or care that they are doing something educational.One thing you will notice quickly with the Leapster Explorer GS is that it does contain some challenges that could lead to frustration. You may need to monitor what your child selects and switch to a different application if the one your kid is playing proves too difficult. On the other hand, if you have kids like mine, you may just want to let them go ahead and try to figure things out. My girls love this electronic device so much that they don't even let some simple frustration get in the way. They will continue to play until they figure things out.Because my kids use this electronic toy so much, the batteries have to be replaced frequently and this is one aspect of the game not to my liking. I have strongly considered buying the adapter pack for this reason. The four AA batteries can get quite costly when having to purchase new batteries every one or two weeks. I could insist that my girls not play the game so much, but they enjoy their time and the educational factor is so good that I am willing to overlook the frequent trips to the store to purchase batteries.Kids love most anything with sounds and actions and the Leapster Explorer GS offers both. Not only does it offer action, it offers it in an educational format that is entertaining enough that kids love it and cannot stop playing. It rates as my girls' favorite newer toy so far.", "My only regret?  My daughter is 9 years old and is on the outside realms of the intended target audience for this product.  I suspect that in a year's time, maybe a little longer, she ultimately will have lost interest in most of the available games.  That having been said, we purchasedLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Disney Pixar Braveand downloaded the accompanying apps from the website, and my daughter is still working on it.  It is challenging enough that it leaves her frustrated from time to time.  I guess this should be considered a good thing!She especially enjoys the camera features, and uploads photos and videos regularly onto the website.  My only complaint in this regard is that the cable is REALLY far too short, and if your tower is tucked under a desk (or is otherwise less than accessible) then you will find the online process to be more awkward than it should be.  Also (as has been observed with very nearly every Leapster product since the dawn of time), this thing drains batteries like nobody's business.  We long ago purchased an AC adapter for a much earlier Leapster, and this solves the problem to a certain extent, but an adapter plugged into an outlet doesn't exactly work well for taking photos and videos.  A rechargeable battery definitely would be a good investment for anyone with a child who will be using this product for years to come.It appears to be every bit as durable as previous Leapsters we have owned, so no worries there.  Good color and sound, and what appears to be a ton of games and apps available online.  Being able to download games instead of buying the cartridges is a considerable improvement; I can only wonder at the number of hours we would not have spent hunting for missing game cartridges had this feature been available on earlier versions.My daughter has loved her Leapster over the years and has gotten plenty out of it.  The product just seems to get better & better.  If you have a younger child, it looks like a very good investment.", "My daughter has the original Leapster Explorer and a few games that she loved to play.  She also had the plug in camera adapter that allowed for pictures.  I don't actively play with the toy, but I can tell you that she's 5 and it's something that she's always asking permission to play with daily (we regulate video games, even educational)This new edition is a sleeker design that includes a built in camera.  The pictures it takes are more for fun than photographic accuracy, but there's one less piece to loose.  The new unit feels more solid and a little heavier, but that may be just perspective.  For small hands the grip isn't as wide between thumb and fingers and the stylus and its storage location in the device are a nice touch.The unit uses 4 AA batteries... and she'll burn through those weekly, so we use ENELOOP rechargeable... Leapster probably has a custom rechargeable battery for this unit, but I find that I'll always have 8-10 AA batteries charged and ready to prevent unhappiness, and I can use the same charger without buying additional wall warts.My daughter is also a big fan of XBOX Kinect based action and moving games, but for a trip or some quiet time when my boys are taking their naps, the Leapster and its large offering of educational games is a good fit for our family.  We keep the new leapster for my 5yd old daughter, and let the 3 year old and 7 month old play with the older unit.", "My boys wanted some video games and I wasn't quite ready for them to get into that yet so I decided to let them have a LeapFrog Explorer first since the games are for learning. We have the older version and now this one too so they don't have to share anymore.I recommend getting some rechargeable batteries so you won't blow through so many. We also bought the A/C adapter; it's good for the times when you're charging the batteries. Both good investments.The games are priced around $25 each in stores but you can get them much cheaper here on Amazon. Our favorites are Phineas and Ferb and SpongeBob.The biggest difference in the old Explorer and this one is that the camera is now included in the device itself and not an attachment that has to be purchased separately.We really love the Explorer and the games. Perfect mix between learning and fun. The games are not straight up learning like some learning toys but these are true videos games with a learning theme.", "Even though the ages listed are 4-9, I picked this up for my nephew who is 3 because there are games available for it listed as ages 3-5.  I kind of expected this to just be a remake of the old Leapster, but was very impressed with the changes.1. The system includes a camera and takes video.  It seems like kids love this feature even though, as an adult, I always think it is a waste.  When the DSi came out, the camera was my daughter's favorite thing and this functionality has been a big hit with the LeapsterGS too.2. I love that for younger kids or kids who tend to lose the little cartridges, there is the option to just purchase games online and download them to the device.  This saves me a ton of money because I'm not re-purchasing cartridges that are lost or go through the washer because they've been put in a pants pocket.  Also, if you watch the app card prices here on Amazon, you can get some great discounts.3. I love that the games are educational.  I kind of hate giving a 3 year old a handheld game system, but knowing he is learning from the games makes me feel a lot better about it.4. It is nice that it comes with 3 applications already loaded so you don't feel like you have to buy the game system and more games upfront just for it to be usable.5. The screen on this is larger than on the old Leapster and the graphics are a definite upgrade.6. The motion sensor allows for a whole different kind of play and is very interactive.  I really like this feature.7. There is a nice carrying case available that will store the game system and up to four games.  I feel like this is a must when buying a game system for a small child.  LeapFrog does this for all of their devices (that I know of) and it is one of my favorite things because all the parts have a home.I would highly recommend investing in some rechargable batteries.  All of these games seem to drain them very quickly.  I actually purchased a charger and two sets of batteries so I can have one set in the game and another in the charger (or fully charged and ready to go).  This system seems to really work well for us.Overall, I would highly recommend this system over the older Leapster.  I really have no complaints!", "LeapFrog has been making hand-held Leapster devices for a few years now, and each iteration shows that they're paying attention to what their customer are saying about the prior ones.  The LeapsterGS builds on the high points of the older models with a few key improvements that really make this the best option for parents who want to give their 4-to-6 year old child an electronic handheld that combines fun with learning.The two biggest improvements that the GS makes are in the app delivery and the on-board camera.  The GS has a large library of downloadable apps that are made easily available by plugging in the unit to your PC via an included USB cable (I guess we can hope for wireless connectivity with next year's Leapster, right?).  There are a variety of educational subjects and themed characters to choose from and they are all reasonably priced, especially compared to the physical cartridges that older Leapsters used.  The GS is fully backward-compatible with the older cartridges, which is very nice if you already have a library from an older sibling to hand down.The GS has a camera built into its sleek, compact case, whereas it was a plug-in attachment with the last model.  The problem with the plug-in (aside from the extra cost) was that it made the unit difficult to store and carry (especially in pockets).  The camera remains one of every kid's favorite features.  It takes decent-quality pictures that they can then doodle on using an included app.  It can also shoot short video clips as well.The unit itself feels durable and all of the prior ones that we've owned have held up very well for years both at home and on the road.One minor downside that I felt was in the software installation for the GS. I did have some errors and delays in this installation that I hadn't experienced with other LeapFrog software, but once I got past these (maybe an hour at most), the synchronization and app delivery has worked just fine.The LeapsterGS is another excellent educational toy that kids pre-K through early grades will surely enjoy.  It's also a great value based on its all-inclusive feature selection, which parents will appreciate.", "This is great for younger kids that aren't ready for a tablet or ds. It works great has many games that you can purchase. My six year old loves to take it where ever we go.", "The primary difference between this and the original Leapster Explorer is that this Leapster Explorer has a narrower and more rectangular-ish shape then the older one that we have for one of our grandchildren.  This one is easier for our smallest granddaughter, a 3 year old, to hold, but the other one didn't really give her any difficulty either.  I'm not sure why the shape was changed.The games that are included on this machine are good for acclimating a child to a new handheld.  I always like it when they give the directions orally because then the smaller children don't struggle as much.  The activities call for the use of the stylus as well as the buttons.  This is enormously useful.  These qualities make it readily accessible to the 3 year old.A lot of games are already on this machine so you don't have to purchase a game for it to be useful.  I counted fifteen activities without hooking it up to your computer or downloading or buying any books or games.Little icons on the first screen lead the child to many different areas, including saved pictures, saved videos, the camera, art studio, and a pet pad game.  This will let you design your own pet and take care of them by giving baths, feeding, and playing with them.  These activities are pretty easy.  One of the activities is to practice writing letters by following the arrows and doing the parts of the letter in the right order.  Then the game gives a word for each letter: A is for angry.  That choice seemed a little off-putting.  I guess it's possible my little pup is still mad at me for getting soap in his eyes?This game does like you to stay IN the lines.  Failing to do so will cause you to get a blurpy bumpy sound until you have done the task correctly.One of the included games is Kat's Math-errific Magic Show:The Frog Collector: You have five minutes to run around and find all of your frogs and put them in the hat with the right number written on it.  Oddly enough, the correct number is the one spoken, not the one that corresponds to how many frogs you have found.  There is a countdown on the top right hand side that tells you how many frogs you need to find and a timer on the top left side.  There are lots of verbal rewards and the girl jumps up and down when you get the right answer!  Along the way you get rewards like a punk frog named Edgar. In between levels there is a carnival like game to play, pressing the A button when the star is in front of the star shape.  Again, there is not always a correlation to when the frogs come out - they are not a reward for aiming at the target correctly.This game gets more difficult quickly.  First you have to jump over obstacles that will let your frogs loose and leave mayhem in your wake and THEN the math problems get harder.  No more finding number 4.  Now you have to answer 55-8.  You lose a star for hitting the obstacle but the girl still jumps for you.In the end, this machine is different, but not significantly different, to need to replace the older versions.  Those were really popular last year.Having tried most of the previous models of these devices made by LeapFrog, I have to say that the most accessible one is the LeapPad.  I like a bigger screen for the smaller children who are going to be a little wilder with their use of the stylus.  The screen size on this was sufficient until the LeapPad, but then it became, well, a little small.I have to say that the children (3-8 year olds) were all excited to see a new LeapAnything in a box on my desk but then they all were only so-so excited when they saw what it is.  Instead of jumping up and down and asking me to open up the new one, they went into my left drawer, third from the top, to find the LeapPad.Bottom lining it, when I need another birthday gift for one of the small children, I will go LeapPad.", "\"Leapfrog's LeapsterGS is a big improvement over previous Leapster models.1. The LeapsterGS has a much better display.  You don't realize it until you compare it side-by-side with a previous generation Leapster.  The screen is about 20% larger (3.5\"\" diag), and has much better resolution and color.2. LeapsterGS is much faster.  You really notice a reduction in the screen-to-screen lag time, boot ups, shut downs, etc.3. LeapsterGS is much more compact.  It is a little bit longer than a Leapster 2, but half as thick, and 1 inch shorter.  I think this is better for small hands.4. The sound on the LeapsterGS is much better.5. Battery compartment access no longer requires a screwdriver like previous models did.  Battery life is also slightly better.6. LeapsterGS includes a camera that takes pictures and video.  Earlier versions of Leapster do not.7. LeapsterGS uses LeapFrog Connect to download games over the internet.  More on this feature later.We started our kids early on with Pixter, which was a product from another manufacturer, and then graduated them to Leapster.  We have owned a total of 4 Leapsters over the years, in both Leapster and Leapster 2 versions.  We also own about 20 games for these earlier versions, which sadly cannot be used with the LeapsterGS.  All electronics manufacturers have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to backward compatibility, and that's understandable.  If you're an existing Leapster owner, you have to take that into consideration as to whether the improvements above are worth starting from scratch.LeapsterGS can connect to a PC with LeapFrog Connect installed on it, using the included USB cable.  LeapFrog connect allows you to download new firmware for the Leapster, buy and download games and videos, upload pictures and videos, and track your child's time spent and progress on many key developmental metrics.  Leapsters have had a positive impact on our children, and now I can actually measure it.  Very cool.If you are looking at this for Christmas, you may notice the games are expensive when compared to other systems.  The Leapster hardware is usually cheap (~$50), and then the games are between $10-$25.  Some games on LeapFrog Connect are a little cheaper, but aren't nearly as good as the ones that make it onto the cartridges.  LeapFrog has a different model than Nintendo DS or Apple iPod Touch.  You just have to get used to it.  I think you end up paying about the same, but this is an educational system, so it's much better for your kids.The LeapsterGS gets a \"\"Highly Recommend\"\" from me.\"", "My 2 nephews and niece love this great Leapfrog LeapsterGS Explorer.They really like the apps and biult in camera.Different games can be bought seperately.I would rather them play with this than a Game Boy or Wii.", "I didn't have high hopes for this device, but I figured it would be pretty good. This was based on my experience with one of the older products, Leapster L Max, prior to trying this one. That one had a coloring game on it then a bunch of advertisements for other games that were not on it. I'm happy to say that this LeapsterGs Explorer doesn't have ads; at least I didn't see any. The only ads it has are on the PC connection software which is OK with me since that part isn't really for kids to be using anyway.The games and activities on it are great for young kids. My daughter found them to be very fun and easy to understand. There are plenty of downloadable games and applications that are under $10 each which is nice, and I especially like that there aren't any cartridges that are needed.I also liked that it logs all the play time on it and provides the parent with areas of math/language/reading... that the child is playing the most both with successful stats and trouble areas.Review Update: After using this for a while we found that it drains batteries very quickly we were going through them fast. We just purchased the re-chargeable battery system for it ($40). I haven't had much time with the recharge system at this point, but if you are buying the LeapserGS Explorer you should certainly consider making theLeapFrog LeapsterGS Explorer Recharger Packpart of the purchase. I dropped the overall review to 4 stars since $40 is a big addition to the system price tag.Pro: Built in cameraPro: Software easy for young children to followPro: Usage stats for parentsPro: Easy to setupCon: Requires a USB to connect to the computer it's not wirelessCon: Drains Batteries Fast", "\"We've been using Leapster products for years, first starting out with the Leapster Explorer, and then a LeapPad. My son was using the leappad, while my daugher was using the explorer. She quickly filled up the 512 MB storage the explorer had with her camera and games, and so we felt it was time to upgrade. We were pleasantly surprised to see that they'd made the LeapsterGS have 2 GB of memory (the same as the LeapPad), so storage probably wouldn't be as much of an issue (at least for awhile). Before even syncing the device, my kids were so excited they turned it on to see what it had. It included several games, including Pet Pad, Escape from the Sillies, a frog game, a cars eBook, and more. They were thrilled to see all of the new games, and played them for sometime.Having had a Mac that was upgraded to 10.8, I had known from contacting Leapfrog support that Leapfrog Connect wouldn't work with 10.8 until 10.8.1 was released. I'd read that the update was coming soon, so I figured my kids would be fine with the pre-loaded games for sometime. That was true, and the 10.8.1 update came out from Apple sooner than I expected. I loaded up Leapfrog Connect, upgraded it to the latest version, and synced the GS. As expected, all of the pre-existing games were loaded onto the GS, and figured my kids would be even more happy. After giving back the GS to my daughter, she turned on the GS and began crying. My son came up to me and said, \"\"Daddy, you made a big mistake.\"\" I couldn't help but wonder what had happened. Everything said it synced just fine. Turns out, all of the free pre-loaded games/books we had were no longer there. Only the games they had before had synced. I plugged it in again, and confirmed everything had been downloaded. It had, but none of the free stuff was there anymore.After contacting Leapfrog Support, they indicated my device most likely was a return that someone had preloaded other games on. That surprised me, as everything looked new. Leapfrog indicated that there wasn't anything that could be done, but I should've been able to get Escape from the Sillies free. When I try to sync and/or download any free apps, it only gave me 3 options, all games we already had, including: Monkey Soccer and Squirrel Summertime games. I was disappointed that, unlike the leapster, we weren't able to just choose our own free game. We were given a choice, and we had all of them. Each time we go into look at new apps (and the GS is hooked up), it asks to for us to download the games. We've already done that! Oh, well. I've still been going back and forth with Leapfrog about the free preloaded game issue, but, as mentioned, nothing new at this time.Regardless of the initial difficult situation we encountered at first, the LeapsterGS is a great device. My daughter absolutely loves it, especially now that she has more memory to take photos. Having a built-in camera is a plus, compared to the expansion on the Explorer, so portability is a bit easier with the cases you can get. From a batter standpoint, it lasts about as long as the explorer. Unfortunately, our rechargeable battery pack for the explorer doesn't work with the GS. Supposably there is a separate one for the GS, but we'll probably just pickup a regular AA rechargeable battery pack set. All of the explorer game cartridges work just fine, although, like the leappad, some of the game demos from the app store don't carry over to the GS or the Leappad. They only work on the older explorer (not sure why).It's been a good device. We're glad we have it. My kids have learned so much from playing the games that many of their teachers have commented at how well they know how to read letters and/or words. It's definitely been a good device compared to getting them a Nintendo DS or iPad/iPod, mostly due to the learning aspect. That alone makes it worth it for my kids.\"", "I feel like Debbie Downer with this review since most on here seem so positive, but there are a few problems I have with this system.  I had my 6 year old try it out, he has played with the DS and Wii, so he's not new to video games.  He really liked the camera and video camera, he especially liked morphing and playing with the photos after he took them.  The games didn't seem to interest him as much, he only played them for 10 or 15 minutes before getting bored.  We did read an ebook on here and it was pretty neat since you can have it read to you and click on the pictures for different sound effects and sayings.  He also thought being able to watch some of his favorite shows on there was pretty cool.The things I hated about this - the batteries.  Why can't this be rechargeable like just about every other electronic device?  I know I can get rechargeable batteries and we even have some, but they're always getting lost or not charged enough or can't remember if this set is charged etc.  And I don't want to buy batteries every time since this ran out of batteries after only about a week of use.Also, it only comes with a couple apps to start out with.  The apps, videos and ebook cost between $5 and $18.  For the price and range of apps you can get with apple or android products, this doesn't seem very competitive.  A few episodes of some of his favorite shows (World Word, Spongebob) cost around $7.50.  I only have a problem with that since we already pay for netflix and can stream many of these shows, and also have some on DVD.  It would be better if you could transfer them from DVD or something.  I know this wouldn't make the company enough money though.Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this if your kid has experience with other gaming systems or tablets.  It could end up getting costly, if they even stay interested.", "I got the LeapFrog LeapsterGS Explorer for my granddaughter.  She also has aLeapFrog LeapPad Explorer.TheLeapster GS Exploreris a lot more portable but provides the same educational value as the LeapPad, minus the e-books (which we don't use...yet).  The built in camera is a lot of fun and the included apps (Pet Pad, Escape of the Sillies and one available as a download from the App Center).  The software is intuitive but downloads and firmware updates are painfully slow.Learning to use the Leapster GS is intuitive for most kids, requiring little to no instruction.  After using aNintendo DSand anApple iPadfor certain games, my granddaughter expected to be able to use motion sensors to do things like tilting the screen, but most of the Leapster GS games don't incorporate this functionality.  Even so, the games are challenging and educational at the same time.  A sense of accomplishment goes a long way, and many of the Leapster games provide encouraging feedback along the way.On the downside, you'll need to invest in theLeapster A/C Adapteror theLeapFrog LeapsterGS Explorer Recharger Packand theLeapsterGS Explorer Carrying Caseunless you relish buying vast quantities of AA batteries or want the device damaged when you travel.We purchasedPhineas and Ferb, and it is quite fun and educational, as well as interchangable with the LeapPad.This is a solid investment for your child.  The device is durable and will be put to good use.", "First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, delivered on time undamaged. Good job Amazon. My daughter who just turned 6 has both a 3ds and my ipad (yes, my ipad, but she uses it more than I do).I was sort of scared to see her reaction when I presented her this toy for a job well done during the week (chores, and yes, she usually gets a $3 toy, but this was a very special chore).She loves art apps on the ipad, so I was hoping this would have something similar, and on the app store their are drawing apps as well. So after giving her this toy, its been a few days and shehas added it to her arsenal of lay on the couch and play toys. Some say this is not good for kids, but the Leapfrog is educational, and I can track her progress as well. The built in camera seems nice, the stylus seems rigid (will probably lose it at some point), and the unit feels like it can take a hit and keep on going. The graphic quality is pretty great as well. I see this slurping down batteries, so definitely invest in rechargeables (knocking a star off for that, since its not rechargeable built-in). Overall, a great learning product for the kids, and has the potential to be great with all the downloadable apps.", "\"The only down side of this might be the price - The Vtech Innotab actually costs less than this, and is roughly the same thing with a larger screen and a better drawing program.With that said, Leapfrog has been one of the standard bearers in this arena for a long time, and this device is no exception: looks a lot like the mini Nintendo offerings, but obviously is geared exclusively for educational purposes.  I plugged it in and it's really self explanatory.  I found the camera quality to be rather low, but it's certainly good enough for children to have hours of fun with.  The screen on it is very bright and colorful; the games are very responsive and fun for kids.This is really about the form factor, and it's easy to hold in one hand... for me, that is... for a smaller child, it may be somewhat unwieldy, but once they get used to it, this is a very easy form factor for fast paced games, and that's really what this device is all about.  Then again, a detraction is that by the time a child is able to really go for it on a fast action game, they'll probably want a device superior to this, like something by Nintendo.  I would rather purchase a child one of the full-on tablet-style offerings that are sure to be a hit this holiday season.  And for good reason: they really are more bang ofr the buck.Pros:- Leapfrog ecosystem- Form factore (if you like it)- Good qualityCons:- Camera quality is \"\"kid quality\"\" only- A little pricey for what it is\"", "I have loved LeapFrog since my first child was born over 10 years ago. From day one they make learning fun. And the Leapster GS takes technology, entertainment, and fun to a whole new level. The built-in camera and mic, as well as tilt-screen capabilities, make for wonderfully interactive play. The sleek design looks more mature so my older son thinks it has a new cool factor. The ability for my 3-1/2 year old to watch eBooks on the bigger screen has been great. They both love Escape of the Silies, an app included with purchase. The biggest drawback is the need to be replacing batteries often, so I'd opt for the rechargeable batteries which are sold separately.Positives: * The ability to put a personal picture with each profile. Excellent for multiple children. * The stylus is attached and attached well * Headphone jack so it can be used in quiet places * It speaks the instructions out loud. Great for the little non-reader * You can download apps and buy cartridges * A good size for little hands, but super durable * It has a camera and takes video! The Negatives: * Drains the batteries super fast. I would have preferred rechargeable batteries", "We love leapster products!  This one has improved game play and I found my 5.5 year old interested in it again.  My 5 year old had outgrown his old leapster and used his leappad much less than the ipad (or DS when allowed).  He does well academically and he's reached the high end of many of the games so there is little challenge for him but I feel that it is good practice (he is reading and doing math on a 3rd+ grade level).  The motion sensor and new camera add a lot to this system.  The sleeker style allows for gaming and makes it great on the go.  My only request is that leapfrog makes some more difficult games but I'm sure the market is not there for them.", "\"This is a great toy. I says 4 to 9 year old but my grandaughter who is not 3 yet was playing the other day and figured out how to use the camera and play a few games on it. This is a great little toy with games and camera in it. The regular leapsters do not have the cameras in them so this is a plus especially for the kids who are always wanting to \"\"use\"\" your camera to take pictures. I have found several apps that are very educational and plus this holds the little games you can buy seperatley.\"", "Lots of fun while she is learning. Brightly colored. Versatile. Imaginative. Creative.  No need to be a computer savvy household. Hey, the 4 year old mastered it, right?", "My daughter got the leappad for Christmas, and I just got her this. She also has an old iPad and iPod touch (which she calls a baby iPad) so she calls the explorer her baby leappad. How the iPod touch is like a miniature iPad and does a lot do what the iPad does, the explorer is very similar as it does a lot of what the leappad does.I would also highly recommendLeapFrog LeapsterGS Explorer Recharger Packif you get this, you will save on batteries. I have it for my daughter's and all I have to do is plug in the LeapsterGS and have it charge, don't need to take out any batteries.The LeapsterGS is very easy to use and like the leappad can have multiple log in's if you have more than one child, so does the explorer. You have a camera on it to take pictures and video with. It comes with a stylis for the touch screen. All the games for the leappad and explorer are interchangeable. You can also Hooke the explore up to the computer to check your child's progress. I have tried out some of the games when I can sneak it away from my daughter, and although the games are eductional, the games are loads of fun and kids don't realize they are learning.It is very durable and can put up with a child's rough play. It is an ideal size for the kids hands. My daughter is able to handle it fairly easily at the age of 6. Consider my daughter is use to playing with the leappad, it didn't take her very long to figure out and navigate the explorer. It is well worth getting.", "Having spent many hours watching the kids play with the last version of the LEAPSTER EXPLORER, I can confirm that many nice new design choices were implemented.  The biggest switch is probably the addition of a motion sensor for movement in new games and activities 2 of which are included through download.  I appreciate the move of the AC adapter to the top as it always fell out of the bottom slot before.  The touch screen feels more accurate and looks brighter, sound is a little deeper and less distorted at top volume as well.  The inclusion of more apps and games right off the bat is also a huge plus there are many more things to do before connecting to the net at all.  The old Leapster cartridges still work in a slot on the bottom of the unit.  The new design is also easier to hold for both smaller and bigger hands, and just looks cooler and less kiddie.  The art studio and now included photo/video camera should keep any child with some imagination busy for days.  The only thing that isn't improved is battery life, which appears roughly the same as before on 4 AA, at around 5-6 hrs depending on brightness and vol. settings.", "Leapster explorer is essentially the same as Leap Frog Leap-Pad with the exception of the screen size. The Leapster GS plays all the Leapfrog Explorer games and you can also download tons more from the LeapFrog website. It comes with 2GB of space, built-in camera / video recorder, built in Microphone, all-new motion sensor, and of course your USB cable and software. The Leapster GS unlike the Leap-Pad has a much longer battery life and is great for kids on the go.  You also get 3 free apps to download to get your child started! I think the Leapster Gs is great, my 5 year thinks it is the business and it is small compact and full of educational fun!  Also check out the cases for this product, the LeapFrog Leapster Explorer Case in pink turns your Leapster into a cute fashion accessory.", "This is great but after having the leappad, I would recommend forking over the extra 20 for a leappad. My nephew much prefers to use our leappad over his own explorer. I think it makes him feel like he has his own Ipad. :)", "The LeapsterGS Explorer is definitely a step up from previous models.  For starters, parents who purchased previous Leapfrog game cartridges will be relieved to find out that this latest version is backwards compatible so those past games can still be enjoyed.  Additional games can be downloaded through the LeapFrog website for a cheaper price than the traditional game cartridges.  This is also beneficial since one does not have to worry about keeping track of the cartridges.  There are also some cosmetic additions such as a built in camera and recording capabilities.  While this do not seem like a major draw, it was a surprising hit with the little ones.  A minor quibble with this unit would the screen size, which simply seems inadequate when compared to comparable units such as theVtech - InnoTab Interactive Learning Tablet.  Kids will probably not care too much but a slightly bigger screen size would have been a welcome addition nevertheless.  In terms of replay value, this unit was a solid hit, despite the very short battery life of the unit.  Rechargeable batteries are simply a must if one plans on purchasing this unit.  Overall, this is well worth the purchase price in terms of being educational and fun for young children.", "\"My son loves it! This thing appears and feels like a high quality device.  The combination of buttons, touch screen, and stylus work really well together.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of the included digital camera and editing software. I really like the letter practice software.  It teaches them (using the stylus) where to start there letter and where to connect the lines.  Of course the expand ability of the device via new games is great, but at first glance I felt that a number of the games are for older kids and some don't appear to have any educational value. II did get it through vine, but  I think that the price on this device is a steal. They must be selling it at a loss in hopes that you'll buy some add on games.  It is worth the money just for the included games / camera.I recommend that you set this up prior to giving it to your child. This way they can get straight to playing with it.  It took me about 60 minutes to get my son's account set up on it and get the free game downloaded.  I'm glad I did it before hand.  They package it so that I was able to remove it, set it up, and put it back in the box without the packaging looking destroyed.  This way, he still got to \"\"open it on his own\"\".\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.025901589542627335, 0.029996288940310478, 0.03730788454413414, 0.03138291463255882, 0.03232894837856293, 0.03351873904466629, 0.036001529544591904, 0.026080703362822533, 0.03238453343510628, 0.030179305002093315, 0.03750015050172806, 0.040413033217191696, 0.02624567039310932, 0.03240981698036194, 0.03815724700689316, 0.02321005053818226, 0.03555837273597717, 0.03081175498664379, 0.03455616533756256, 0.037728436291217804, 0.036863770335912704, 0.03523517772555351, 0.035816047340631485, 0.037872981280088425, 0.03860102593898773, 0.03115200810134411, 0.02458418719470501, 0.03512018173933029, 0.035265836864709854, 0.037815600633621216]]}
