This caddy for the v3 is totally designed WRONG! The elastic cord will slip up the receiver and not keep as much tension on the unit to the stand. They could really make this a lot better with a little thought before making the mold...", "I have seen many photographers including myself hang the pocket wizards by the lanyard on the light stands. Its effective and cheap however when moving stands they sway back and forth and over time can cause dents, scratches, and even a few drops.If your reading this review then you probably already have a pocket wizard setup and you know they are not cheap! So protect them by securing them to light stands with this caddy! Just be sure to pick the proper one. Hildozine makes a caddy for the Plus II and the Plus III.I can verify 100% that the plus II caddy works on the plus III pocket wizard, however its not the proper one and doesn't look right. This unit is the Plus III caddy.These caddy units tightly lock the pocket wizard to any light stand. The pocket wozard can still slide up and down the stand no problem and is easily removed. These are must have units for any strobist photographer, or pro that has pocket wizards. The only downfall is it screws into the back of the pocket wizard and you cannot access the battery tray until its removed, other than that its amazing! You must grab a few of these.I hope this was helpful.

You just attach it to your radio and can put it in the stand or the flash itself.", "This product works very well in securing the PocketWizard III to just about any light stand, tripod, etc. Highly recommended.", "Ok, so the Pocket Wizard III comes with a small lanyard, loop it around the knob of your light stand, not so secure, attach the caddy and attach to your stand, flash, pole or boom, no dropped Pocket Wizard and no stress on your strobes PC connection. Its worth it, own it. On the downside, it attaches to your PocketWizard by screwing into the backside, abit of a hassle if you needed to change batteries in the middle of a session, but we all know better than that. Simple and effective.", "I use this caddy with my PlusX radios.  There is a screw on the caddy that is designed to work with the tripod mount on the PlusX.  I leave the caddy mounted to my PlusX.  Is very snug on the light stand and stays put.  Seems just a but pricey, but it's a niche product and if you need it you need it.  For me, worth the cost just to keep things tight and tidy during a shoot.", "it holds my pocketwizard ever so gently and firmly against the stand. its as if it cares personally for the well being of my pocketwizard. i trust this product with my pocketwizard's safety. as a matter of fact, this transceiver caddy once saved my pocketwizard from a burning building. no. but i feel that if it were possible then yes.", "This is a great idea, but it has flaws. First, the elastic band wants to slip off the top 'shoulder' of the Pocketwizard. This is because the two holes where the elastic is anchored are too far apart and actually spread the elastic band open. This can be remedied by twisting the band once on the backside of the unit as you pull the band over the lighting stand pole. Then it holds as shown in the picture.Second, the Pocketwizard is only half against the area around the mounting screw, and it will give you the impression that it's not cradled in the caddy very tightly. The Pocketwizard will move around a little.Finally, there are no rubber feet on the back, and the attaching screw will mar your flash unit if you attach it to a speedlight head.", "I love these things BUT there is one bad design issue that they've never addressed. The screw that holds them to the body of radio blocks the battery cover. So it has to be unscrewed to change the batteries. Which means I need a tool or a coin to deal with this and for me, that's a bad design. I love these things and I've used them for years on several sets of PocketWizards but the truth is, I'm moving away from them because of that hassle. I'm buying brackets for my stands so that I don't need these caddys.They make work for you. They are well made and do what they purport to do wonderfully. I just hate unscrewing them and then screwing them back on every time I want to change batteries."], "Gamma": [0.33333417773246765, 0.3333316445350647, 0.33333417773246765], "Beta": [[0.00019274192163720727, 0.003174781333655119, 0.19660645723342896, 0.03198506683111191, 0.00015281378000508994, 0.1982460916042328, 0.15947005152702332, 0.22039009630680084, 0.18978188931941986], [0.00019274627265986055, 0.0031748421024531126, 0.1966063380241394, 0.031985364854335785, 0.00015281869855243713, 0.198246031999588, 0.15947005152702332, 0.22039003670215607, 0.18978182971477509], [0.00019274192163720727, 0.003174781333655119, 0.19660645723342896, 0.03198506683111191, 0.00015281378000508994, 0.1982460916042328, 0.15947005152702332, 0.22039009630680084, 0.18978188931941986]]}
