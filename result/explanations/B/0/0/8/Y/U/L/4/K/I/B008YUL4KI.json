"], "reviews": ["For chai tea lovers everywhere, listen up. This product rocks and tastes better than Starbucks chai tea ( if any of you find that relevant) I do enjoy a nice hot cup of tea on a regular basis, and when I tried this, I was pleasantly pleased. Nice hints of spice and just the right amount of cinnamon. Add some milk and a little raw sugar and Bam! You got one tasty cup of tea!", "The Cinnamon Chai is a nice, flavorful tea with a cinnamon punch to it.  It isn't overwhelming.  Just the right amount of cinnamon flavor.  I'm not much of a tea drinker, but this one is delicious and I drink it hot, with a dab of honey for sweetening.The bags are uniquely made, in a triangular shape with and each bag has a string securely attached and once they are ready for use, just unravel the tie.  After the usage of the bags, I do add them to the compost.Good tasting tea!!  Will purchase more....Rizzo", "I am a real Chai lover and have sampled many many Chais.  This one from Lipton is quite good-flavorful, excellent alone or with milk and/or sweetener.  Better than most of the Lipton teas I have tried.", "I drink a lot of tea, especially during the winter and chai is one of my weaknesses.  This tea has a wonderful taste, the scent is enticing and it is warming on a cold winter's night.  The pyramid bags let the hot water flow through and hit the loose tea from all different angles, allowing it to brew to perfection.The only thing I found to be a possible problem is the string to pull the bag out of the hot water.  Sometimes it sticks to the teabag and when you pull if off, will tear a good sized hole in the bag, rendering it usless.", "I've always felt that Lipton tea has had issues with quality and balance of flavor and scent.Lipton Pyramid Spiced Cinnamon Chai is one that does not adhere to the lower expectation one might have with Lipton.  The flavor is balanced and the smell isn't over powering.  I've generally sided with teas from Stash but this Lipton is a welcome change.  I also drink my tea without any milk or sugar so customer experience may vary if mixing this tea with the above.", "\"I was intrigued by the description, wondering how it would be different from other Chais (which have cinnamon added as part of the chai masala herb blend). Theoretically, the pyramid shape of the tea bag is to allow for higher quality tea ingredients as well as larger pores for better infusion of the tea outside the tea bag. However, I found this this Chai very \"\"Americanized\"\" - it has very muted clove and cardamom, and did not taste nearly as fragrant as it smelled. The cinnamon was definitely much stronger than what you'd find in a traditional Chai. I was disappointed with the weak brew, especially since it is a pyramid tea bag. For my second pot, I doubled the number of bags that I used and it helped some, but overall, the tea was not one that I loved. It's definitely drinkable, but it will probably stay in my cupboard for a while and I'm unlikely to choose this brand again when I want Chai.\"", "When I first opened the box, it had an odd smell of spices, but after brewing up the tea the spices blended well together. I added a little half and half and Stevia to mine.  It was great for a relaxing moment in my day!", "\"I have grown to love chai tea because of our local coffee shop.  I was very excited to try these bags at home.  The first thing I noticed was the shape of the bags.  They are like little pyramids.  This is supposed to make the tea leaves be able to distribute more evenly.  It definitely does allow them more room to brew.  I do not feel like it has an overly strong \"\"tea\"\" flavor, but more of the spices that are found in chai. I have not tried it cold yet, just hot.  I usually just fix it with hot water, sometimes adding a little milk.  I also love the health benefits of drinking chai tea, so it's an added bonus that it tastes great.\"", "When I first opened the box this tea smelled wonderful. it has a very rich scent to it. So I was anxious to give it a try.Unfortunately the tea's taste isn't as good as the aroma it gives off. For me flavor wise you have to add honey or some other sweatener to make it taste decent enough to drink. With that said, I understand different people have different tastes. For me, this isn't a must buy nor a drink all the time.", "I love chai teas, and I love spicy teas for winter.  The Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai is a deliciously rich tea for the season.  I've enjoyed it black, as well as with cream and sugar.  I thought I'd prefer it with cream and sugar, but I actually prefer drinking it black, while it's still nice and hot. It has a warm cinnamon flavor that doesn't taste bitter or need sweetened to be enjoyable.I know Lipton claims that the pyramid bag lets the tea move around more freely and steep better, but I prefer the pyramid teas because they usually have better ingredients. I can see pieces of fruit (or in this case it's cinnamon chunks) in the tea bag that I can't see in the flat opaque tea bags.  The tea leaves themselves also appear to be larger and fresher, as opposed to the powdered leaves that usually find their way into the flat bags.", "While this makes a perfectly pleasant cup of tea as such, I could get the same from a standard Lipton bag of black tea or orange pekoe. In short, nothing special about this as far as my palate is concerned. The cinnamon? The spice? The classic characteristics of chai? MIA in this product. The pyramidal teabag is kinda cute, but it's a bit of trick to deploy the string without pulling it off the bag entirely.", "The Lipton pyramid teabags are made of a lovely silky fabric that hold the perfect amount of tea. The Spiced Cinnamon Chai has a nice cinnamon flavor. The chai is a bit spicy as one could expect. I really like this line of tea from Lipton. This is the third flavor I have tried and I have not been disappointed by any of them.", "Call this Pseudo Chai.  No cardamom in the tea makes for a basic cinnamon spice black tea. It's tasty, and pleasant, not too strong, not weak.  But it's not really chai, not without cardamom.  And it's not strong enough in flavor to handle milk or cream, like a typical chai.", "Even if I liked the spice ratio in this tea, which I don't, it is simply too weak. Without milk it is barely palpable. With milk it is dishwater. Needing 2 tea bags for 6 oz. of tea is unacceptable for me.The spice mix is just wrong for chai tea. The predominant flavor is cinnamon. After that, there is a muddy bitterness that I do not like. The ingredients after tea and cinnamon are clove, chickory, allspice, and black pepper. Seriously?At least the pyramid shape is innovative and cute.", "\"I have really enjoyed using these tea \"\"bags\"\" from Lipton.  They are shaped like little mesh pyramids, allowing the tea to float within the bag while infusing and (apparently) improving the process and quickly imparting full flavor to the water.  The chai and spices are well combined and produce a very tasty flavor to the finished tea.  I think that these would be very useful for the tea lover who is in an office setting in which the use of a traditional infuser might not be practical.There are some aspects of this product that caused me to think twice about endorsing it: the bag does not appear to be made of biodegradable material (it almost looks like a plastic substance of some sort), which causes me environmental concern, and it is hard to think of a circumstance in which someone would use this product but could not alternatively choose a traditional tea caddy with loose tea.  The string attached to the bag also breaks readily when you try to do the \"\"wrap the bag around your spoon and squeeze\"\" technique to extract the last bits to tea goodness into your cup.  These points being noted, I liked using this product very much and it produced very enjoyable tea!Note on Nov 26: I am always trying to improve my reviews, so if you're tempted to vote that my review is not \"\"helpful,\"\" please take a few moments and leave a comment as to your reasons so I can do better next time. Thanks!\"", "Maybe it's just my tastebuds, but I can't really taste any cinnamon in this stuff.  Or any other spices for that matter.  I don't taste much difference at all between it and the regular kind.  The pyramid shaped bags I don't think do much either.  The Traditional Medicinals herbal teas I buy are better even without funny pyramid shaped bags.That is all.", "A great value for a bold, well blended chai blend. Based on the name, I was a little worried that the cinnamon that is singled out by name might be overpowering. But the black tea does a great job of balancing the spices with cinnamon in a bold but well blended chai tea.Fragrant and delicious, this is one I'll buy again and again.", "I really wanted to like this, because I enjoy a good chai. I tried it both on it's own and with vanilla almond milk; it wasn't bad, but is not something I expect to buy in the future. By itself, it was a little bitter and flat. With almond milk and sweetener, it was too weak and lacked the depth of spiciness other chai teas have. I'll be passing on this in the future.", "I'm a big fan of chai tea when it's cold out. The spicy aroma and taste are great. I take mine with lots of sugar and no milk.The Lipton version that I tried out here is OK, but not something I'd recommend very highly. It was very difficult to get the tea bag to totally submerge for some reason and there was very little spicy aroma while the tea was brewing and as I drank it. There was a spicy taste, but it was only a weak one. I have tried another brand of chai tea (Tazo) that is easy to find in supermarkets and about the same price, and I liked it better - a little stronger spicy aroma and taste. I have tried a slightly more expensive chai brand in addition, and it had a wonderful spicy aroma and taste, which was better than the Lipton and the Tazo,  but it is much harder to find.I'd skip this Lipton chai, unless you really want chai and can't find a better brand. It is OK in a pinch, but only OK.", "Nice chai flavor with this tea.  That's not so hard to find...but I totally love these little pyramid bags!  They look charming, both before AND after they've been used.  Not that I do fancy tea parties, but they just look so cute sitting on the saucer.  The bag is not only different in shape than regular tea bags, the material it's made from is different.  It is like a silky gauze instead of that papery stuff (that sometimes tears when you squeeze it).  Although I got these free from Amazon Vine, I'll definitely buy these again.  They've got lots of different flavors, too...and I liked these for both hot and iced tea.", "I've never been a big chai drinker, as I like my tea sans calories, but I've liked other commercial chai teas in the past, and I like this one as well. There's not a real strong chai flavor to this. The cinnamon and cloves seem to predominate, and the black pepper is a nicely detectable flavor. It's a very rich and hearty tea, and sweetener is a necessity (for me anyway). I just wish that Lipton would put a wax paper or plastic liner in the box to keep the tea fresher, but that's my only caveat. For me, this is a refreshing and somewhat complex nice spiced tea. Hardcore chai drinkers may have another opinion.", "\"My elderly cat has never ever shown any interest in human beverages. When I sat down to drink this particular tea, however, she sprang to the cup, circled it, then snuggled up to it and relished the aroma as if it were fresh fish. She almost knocked it over once, that's how impressed she is with it. I am still trying to shoo her away so that I might savor it and then write a review.Later: Now that she has fallen into a slumber, I'll continue. I had to rewarm the tea, of course, and sipping it slowly what impresses me most is the natural spice flavors that really do blend nicely. I was surprised to read that black pepper is one of them and thought to myself \"\"What is that doing there?\"\" but it is surprising how nicely it blends in with the other spices.The pyramid bag is impressive, and even pretty. The tea itself is not weak and not strong, in my opinion. It's in-between. I feel I would like to add a small amount of honey to it; however, I don't have any in the house right now and it is satisfactory as is.Chai (rhymes with pie and the Ch sounds like tjai) is a black tea especially made in India. The spices are cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, chicory root and cloves. It is pleasantly aromatic.I particularly enjoy just opening the lid of the box and smelling the natural ingredients. I have a hunch this would be good if you had a cold.It's a pleasant tea and I am going to enjoy drinking it. Somehow you want to drink it slowly. Sweet meditation!\"", "As an avid tea drinker I found this tea delightful and flavorful.  I am not sure the pyramid shape tea bag makes much difference, probably more of a marketing effort at uniqueness.  Nonetheless, good tea and enjoyable to drink.  I recommend this product.", "If you like flavored teas this is a good one, especially around the Holidays. It is highly pleasing to the taste buds has a nice aroma with perfectly blended spices. Great anytime, and especially on those Cold days, also good for after dinner or as dessert tea.", "\"Having always been a big tea drinker, I am well familiar with Lipton and have always been a fan of their many high-quality products. And having recently been turned on to chai when I sampledHiggins & Burke Tea, Chai Black, 20-Count (Pack of 6), I was more than ready to give this Lipton chai a test run. I can report that I was very satisfied and quite happy with the taste and quality of this product. I like the pyramid shaped bags, but also how they are held by the string in two places to keep the pyramid pyramid-shaped as the tea steeps in the cup. The aroma is uplifting - spicy, but not to the point of distraction. The taste is like the aroma, varied and pungent, with a smooth delicateness accented by the varying bold flavors coming from the spices. By adding just a touch of brandy this has become my latest \"\"go to\"\" breakfast beverage. This is a very good chai and I recommend it to regular tea drinkers and chai lovers alike.\"", "Lipton pyramid teas are one of the better grocery store teas.  This Chai tea lives up to the Lipton name.  A fine blend of black tea with just the right amount of spice. However compaired to a true Chai, this tea falls short.  I find it more peppery and lacking the cardamom and anise.Overall it's a nice tasting tea, but if your looking for a true Chai, look elsewhere.", "This product was disappointing to say the least. It had a nice light scent, but the taste was just like black tea and cinamon. I didn't get the spices that you would normally get in a chai tea. In addition, if you added in milk or cream, it just made it worse. With cream or milk, it just made it into a milk or cream drink with cinamon that tasted nothing like Chai tea.I would not recommend this product, especially at this cost. There are many other products out there that taste much more authentic and for a fraction of the cost.", "\"Well, I've long been a big fan of tea (and if you want to be fancy, \"\"herbal infusions\"\") and frequently make my own loose leaf blends, so I was pretty pleased to try out this Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai.  In my opinion, if you're going to buy prepackaged tea rather than making your own blends from loose leaf ingredients, Lipton isn't exactly the greatest brand to choose from (especially compared to more awesome brands such as Tazo or Numi).  Still, I'm no tea snob and I'll drink anything that tastes good!So, how does the Lipton Chai hold up?  Well, it's okay.  Just okay.  It tastes like a mild, inoffensive black tea with a rather weak spice to it.  It's not bad or anything, but it's not exactly spectacular.  From it's smell (which is rather strongly spicy) I expected something stronger, but strangely it is rather weak-tasting. Go figure.Now, taste aside, the little triangular bags are cool, and it does seem to diffuse nicely.  As for any other issues...I take issue with Lipton's practice of using \"\"natural flavors\"\" which almost always means some artificial flavor additive.  It always felt like cheating to me - if you're going to make a tea, don't cheat by adding fake extra flavors to it!  Also they seem to be unable to make tea without adding pointless soy to it.  My mother is allergic to soy, so I've started noticing it more and more in ingredient lists, and I remember how shocked and disappointed she was when she first learned that Lipton seemed to add soy to all their teas.  It now annoys me whenever I see soy in tea where it doesn't need to be!Anyway, if you're not allergic to soy, this isn't a terrible tea or anything.  It's okay.  If you just want a very mild chai I suppose you could go with this option.\"", "Full of flavor, with a cinnamony zip, this is a perfect wake-up tea-type drink. The bags are triangular to allow for full brewing, and the chai is full-bodied and comforting. This was the tea I chose when I was feeling under the weather, and it really helped to make me feel better.", "\"The Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai tea is not my favorite flavor ever.  For my personal taste, I'd of liked a stronger Cinnamon presence.I do like the pyramid shaped bags as they provide a great brewing experience and it is also nice to be able to \"\"examine\"\" the look of the tea before brewing.I really liked the Blackberry Vanilla flavor that I tried the last time. So, I'm sure there are others who will really like this flavor. To each their own.\"", "Pretty nice for bagged tea. no, it's not as good as really great loose leaf chai, but this is a nice substitute.  It is very spicy though, but has a great taste.  Enjoyable.", "\"This is a very nice spice tea, the blend of spices is assertive, yet - not irritating. I enjoy this with a bit of milk, just as an Indian would drink the Chai. The bag shape is interesting, but I do not observe that it changes the flavor, as opposed to \"\"normal\"\" tea bags. I drink many types of tea, and this is a good-quality representation of Chai. If you are not going to make yousr from \"\"scratch\"\", this is a an easy way to obtain the same pleasing taste.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.032752346247434616, 0.03264496847987175, 0.03157832473516464, 0.03765185549855232, 0.02627093531191349, 0.03080499917268753, 0.03254421427845955, 0.03405900299549103, 0.033332522958517075, 0.026271572336554527, 0.03323294222354889, 0.02767893671989441, 0.029029233381152153, 0.030926896259188652, 0.03136385232210159, 0.03365539014339447, 0.032244808971881866, 0.030722493305802345, 0.028682801872491837, 0.029433276504278183, 0.03110162913799286, 0.032557208091020584, 0.03391878679394722, 0.028894972056150436, 0.03126160427927971, 0.03228934854269028, 0.031932417303323746, 0.02273048274219036, 0.03186152130365372, 0.032621145248413086, 0.033278170973062515, 0.03267134353518486]]}
