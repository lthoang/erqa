The price was good. The features advertized all work as they should. Audio recording is less than stellar with lots of \"\"washing\"\" noise sounds in the background from road noise (audio recording can be disabled). The G-sensor feature shows G force on X, Y and Z axis which would register the impact of a collision or other forces against the vehicle. the GPS shows the traveled path. Suction cup is solid and mounts easily. The software gets installed on the microSD card when formatted in the device. It lists both Windows and Mac but I was only able to get the software to show up under Windows so far. Using the included software, recorded files can be reviewed, saved to other media, GPS track seen, G-sensors visible, etc. the saved AVI file can be viewed in other video players, albeit without the additional G-sensor and GPS data. Has built-in LiIon battery and DC charge/operate cord for 12v. The orange button on the front seems to be an emergency button to press in the event of a crash -> seems that this simply locks the file on the card so that it cannot be accidentally deleted. Not GoPro Hero quality but look at the price point... and you'd have to use 2 GoPro to get the job done. Manual is in Chinglish so you may need an interpreter. Seems to be no setting for English/Metric so speeds, etc. are in Km/hr.Cheap insurance, in my own honest opinion. Perhaps I'll capture something as cool as a Russian dash cam YouTube video someday...Added 1/5/14 -> If there is a battery inside this DVR, mine must be dead because no amount of charging will get it charged. Otherwise functioning just fine though.\"", "I feel Russian! haha, this devide does a great job to record all car movements, reverse and drive, it records peoples faces while driving and the road, you can also see yourself driving but this can be changed to just see yourself or just the road in the lcd screen but it will still record everything in the background. I bought this after the meteorites fell in Russia, i thought to myself this is a wonderful device to keep track of accidents for insurance practices and to have evidence of stuff going down the road, JUST BUY IT!", "I love this thing for multiple reasons, its like having a little witness in you car at all times. It will give you your speed, where you are in the world along with a front shot and a interior shot all provided with video. You really get your bang for your buck with this thing!", "I recently purchased this camera, and am still discovering it's abilities.This replaced a previous accident camera which died. It has two cameras which can be rotated forward or backwards (Or up and down). It's designed for the cameras to be pointed in opposite directions. But both cameras can be pointed in the same direction, with video from one them being upside down. One camera is a night camera. The other is a normal color camera. Both feed to it's builtin DVR, which has a video screen. It has a small external GPS, which plugs into the DVR. It attaches to the mount. The mount is a standard camera mount with a suction cup to attach to your windshield. (This is convenient since the unit will attach to any camera mount (Without the GPS unit). Also you can use the mount with almost any camera.)It does not come with the required Micro SDHC memory card. The card you use must be above a Class 6 card. I use a Class 10 card.When you start this unit up, you go through a menu of options on it's screen. All videos from either or both cameras can be played back on this screen. You will need to set the time, even if you don't do anything else. It has it's own file system and it's own software, which is transferred to the microSDHC card at the time that the card is formatted. After formatting the card with the DVR, put it into your computer and copy the software to your computer for a backup. (I even archived this.)The unit records the video from both cameras in a split screen format, along with your speed and location. (It defaults to KPH. But clicking in this in the software will show your speed in MPH.) Using the included software, you can playback either or both screens. You use the included software to copy the files to your computer. There will be locked files which were locked when you hit a bump or made a sudden stop. Using the software, you can lock or unlock video files. You can also export the videos as normal videos. The normal videos will show both screens at once. Plus the exported videos only show date and time videos were shot. I haven't discovered a way to simply export the video from just one camera.An interesting idea is the software's ability to connect to Google maps and show the location where the video was shot, if the software is being run from your computer and it is connected to the Internet.I see one issue as a drawback. It is designed to record everything forward while the night camera is pointed backwards. It will records the driver, and everyone inside the vehicle, plus the view through the back window. The problem is that if you point it forward, the video from that night camera will be upside down.A second issue is the slot for the Micro SDHC card. The internal slot does not lineup exactly with the opening in the plastic body, or it didn't on mine. The 1st time that I put my card in, the card slipped past the internal slot. I fished it out and inserted it properly. Now, this is something that I watch each time that insert the card.I've been surprised at the video from the night camera. It is surprising good.I'm on Amazon now getting ready to order another camera for a 2nd vehicle. Someone stole a $250 accident camera out of my 2nd vehicle and I figure this camera will replace it for less then half the price.I haven't found a problem with the instructions. But I haven't needed them much beyond telling what each button does and where everything plugs in, which is plainly stated in the instructions.Update July 27, 2013I just reduces it by 1 star. I liked the 1st one so well that I purchased a 2nd one for a different vehicle. The 2nd camera unit was defective. It started up in Russian, then shut down before I could switch languages in it. The reason that it shut down was because the cord was not charging the internal battery. Since this was my 2nd unit, I tried the cord from the 1st one, which I knew was a good cord. I then got the same result with it.So it appears that there is a problem with quality control on these units. (Or else a problem with Amazon shipping.) It's like going to Las Vegas. Sometimes you get a good one. And sometimes you don't. That's where the Amazon guarantee kicks in...The instruction book is in several languages, including English.AlsoThis unit has 2 color lenses. But one of them is a night vision camera which records in black & while while in a dark setting.Using the menu, you can choose to record from both lenses, or from either one of them.On the issue of the Menu button, you can do several things from the menu. Here are a few of them:Format the memory card. (Operating control software is copied to the memory card when it is formatted.)Change languages.Select which recording lenses.Select GPS recording or not.Set the date and time (It does not get this information from the GPS.)Set it to automatically record sound or not.And several other things.A different button function controls playback on it's built-in screen.As I just said, sometimes you get a good unit, and sometimes you don't.There does not seem to be any problems sending it back to Amazon if you get a bad unit.", "I bought this unit because it is cheap and portable for work purpose.  It doesn't come with wall-mount charger but the manufacture asks an initial 4-8 hours of charging time.  Who would leave a brand new device charging in a running car for that long?  Therefore, I bought another AC-DC (car charger) for about $30+ just for this device.  You are not able to install the program on your computer.  If your computer requires administrator right to run an &#34;exe&#34; file, you may have to call your tech support each time when you try to access these files from SD card.  If you could overcome all these issues, then this dashboard cam is acceptable at that price.", "Not HD for sure. Very easy to fall off which makes it not reliable if the road condition is bad. One of the cam is upside down if you wanna face them to the same direction. GPS function is nice and audio is ok except you wont hear much from the rear seat. Returned mine cause it just takes too much space on my window.", "This thing is by far the best dash cam I've gotten so far.  I like the camera quality alot.Pros:-It's a smaller than it looks.  Some ladies might find this to be a con though :)-The camera quality is just superior to that more expensive incredi-sonic camera:  better light levels, and can actually SEE outside windows, unlike that incredi-sonic dash cam.-The camera actually has a good wide angle.  It can capture the passenger/driver side windows as well as the rear windows, simultaneously.  whilst the more expensive incredi-sonics rear camera only captures HALF of the rear window...basically useless.-Really awesome suction cup.  Very generic, which is good because it will stick on all the generic suction platforms that come with other products like gps, radar, etc.Cons:-It's only 720p.-I can't figure out how to make it record sound.  No big deal because I don't want to record any embarrassing videos of myself farting or singing to myself."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00015746746794320643, 0.20337504148483276, 0.03852732107043266, 0.42460712790489197, 0.04234444350004196, 0.29034262895584106, 0.0006459972937591374]]}
