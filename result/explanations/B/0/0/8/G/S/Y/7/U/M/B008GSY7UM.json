"], "reviews": ["This is an ok quality mirror with reasonable magnification but it takes up too much space on the already crowded bathroom vanity area around the sink. That's where it makes most sense for me but with the fold out panels it needs a lot of space.Currently, I use the metal stand type magnification mirror that can be flipped around for magnification/regular mirror and has a lighted circular band around it which mimics indoor light. That mirror is taller and so I don't have to bend to apply makeup. This Jerdon mirror is meant for a sit down arrangement in my opinion, which reduces its usefulness for me.  It would be great if your bathroom has a tall stand where you can place this mirror. The fold out feature is great for hair styling and an outlet is located conveniently in front of the mirror but unless it's placed at the right height it takes away the convenience. But it's a little smaller than needed for hairstyling.The good things about the mirror are options for 4 types of fluoroscent lighting, which can be useful especially if your bathroom has the yellower lighting which does not show the true colors of makeup. Other than that I think the stand magnification mirrors sold in large warehouses etc. are much more convenient and take up less space for bathroom usage and are at sub $20 prices.It's a nice mirror but I won't be using it much unless I can find a dedicated space for it in the bathroom.", "It is a bit bulky and hard to store as the back that works as a stand does not stay up when you put it away. You could see yourself clearly when doing makeup, examining your skin, clearing pores or putting on your contacts. The lighting options (as additional pictures show) are a plus, but I think it could be a bit brighter, and the lighting options aren't really that accurate to the real thing. It basically gives a hue to the light. With some minor flaws, it is definitely better than any other unfocused lighting.", "I received the Jerdon Makeup Mirror with some damage to the box, but the item was in perfect condition. It's a fairly large mirror to sit on a counter. I really like the lighting options: Day, Office, Evening or Home. You can adjust the lighting with just a slide of a button. The product is well made, sturdy and has a adjustable height feature in the back. My niece and son's girlfriend both want it--they loved it for putting on makeup. I especially like the magnifying mirror so you can see those tiny eyebrow hairs to tweeze. It also features an outlet on the front to plug in a curling iron. Highly recommended.", "This product exceeded my expectations. It is actually much more sturdy and larger than it appears in the picture. The mirror's construction is high quality, and the center mirror pivots to allow you to switch between regular and high magnification. One word of caution, though: as with any mirror, please be certain not to place this product in the path of direct sunlight to avoid starting a fire. This is especially true for mirrors like this with more magnification. This safety note is described in the instructions, of course, but repetition in the name of safety never hurts!", "Every sweet adeline needs a makeup mirror for prepping for performances, and this one fits the bill!  I had a makeup mirror like this thirty years ago and had forgotten how useful they are!  The different lighting options help with color accuracy.  ONly wish it had a batteries-only option for those times when an electrical outlet is not readily available, but otherwise, no complaints.  This is a great, light-weigh makeup mirror!", "\"First of all, what comes in the box is NOT what you see on the Amazon product page. The product page shows the mirror as having two mirrored side panels. THE UNIT DOES NOT HAVE THE SIDE MIRRORS. In my opinion, there are two main reasons for having a makeup mirror: 1) the adjustable lighting for applying makeup base for different lighting settings like office or outdoors etc., and 2) the side mirrors which help you see how the makeup looks from the side so that you don't have those jaw line makeup demarcations. Without the side mirrors, half the reason for having this mirror is gone.What you get instead is a lighted flippable mirror - zoomed on one side - good for basic things like eyebrow plucking or simple lipstick application (which you can also do with a simple two-sided $5 mirror from the five and dime). Even with applying eye makeup, I still like having the side view so that's out with this setup as well. Also, this mirror is very small. Seems like it's more of a travel mirror than a makeup mirror for everyday use. And it's very \"\"light.\"\" I would appreciate a heavier, sturdier product. Although lighter is better for travel so that point is debatable depending upon how you plan to use this.I thought this would be an upgrade to my beloved tri-fold makeup mirror from the late 1970s/early 1980s which I still have and which still works beautifully. I was so wrong. What makes me really mad is that they advertise the product one way but it ends of being a different product when you get it. It's the type of thing that stays in your mind over time when looking at other products by the manufacturer.I cannot recommend this product from a standpoint of usability or manufacturer trust. Shop around first.\"", "\"I really love this mirror. I wanted a light up mirror to use at my living room table to apply makeup. It is too hot and moist in my bathroom to apply makeup after a shower and too dark in my living room to apply with a regular mirror. This Jerdon mirror was the perfect solution for me.The mirror comes with four different light settings: Day, Office, Evening or Home. It also has two different mirrors: regular and 5x magnification. I love that this allows me to see what my makeup looks like in different lighting and up close. No more looking at your eye shadow outdoors and saying \"\"Ohh No...it wasn't that ugly color when I put it on inside\"\". The 5x Magnification is great for picking pesky hairs and doing tougher makeup like lip liner and eyeliner. The side mirrors are also helpful to view the sides of your face.This mirror also has an outlet plug on the front of it. This is very convenient for curling or flat-ironing your hair. It also has an adjustable back-stand so that you can put the mirror at the angle you prefer. The only downside is that the back-stand doesn't have anything to hold it up when you fold the mirror down for storage. This isn't an issue for me since I am storing it in a slim space that holds it together.I would definitely recommend this mirror. If you are looking for an easier way to put on makeup, remove hair or even do your hair, this is a great solution.\"", "This mirror has an adjustable stand. You can adjust the angle from fairly upright to about 60 degrees from the table (which is quite a steep angle. I'm not sure how that would be useful). Anyway, the mirror rotates easily. It has 1X and 5X magnification. The light has 4 different filters. The daylight one is the best. It is simply a white light. I don't really find the 3 others (office, evening, and home) useful for me.A nice feature of this mirror is that it has an electric outlet on the front of the unit.The thing that bothers me the most about this mirror is that it is rather bulky.", "Replaced the less useful, magnifying mirror by my bedside.  Lighting options are great.  If I could change one thing would have the backside of the mirror a 10X instead of a 5X version.  I use this all the time now.", "\"My bathroom mirror is really too far away for me to have a good look at myself when putting on makeup or doing other things I need to see well.  Leaning over the sink is uncomfortable and casts shadows, so I thought this mirror would be just what I need.  Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed in it.First of all, the side lights really don't do that much for illuminating my face.  I'm better off tilting my head towards the four bulbs over my vanity.  Yet the side lights on this mirror, being so close, are quite blinding and annoying.  I find myself wanting to shield my eyes.  How they manage to illuminate so poorly at the same time is a bit of a mystery.In theory, the adjustable color settings for the light would be a good idea.  For \"\"day,\"\" the bulbs are uncovered.  For \"\"office\"\" they have a sickly seafoam filter (few offices have THAT atrocious of lighting anymore).  \"\"Evening\"\" is a slightly blue-purple, and \"\"home\"\" is pinkish.  As another reviewer noted, none of the colors seem particularly accurate to their described environments, but if you want to check how you look under oddly tinted lights just to cover all bases, I suppose this could be handy.  I wish the slider had a more \"\"finished\"\" feel to it.  It kind of sticks and is difficult to move one-handed.  Also, you have to watch the filters to see when they are centered over the light; the slider doesn't have any built-in \"\"stops.\"\"The bulbs are not user replaceable.  The instructions say the bulbs are \"\"long-life\"\" and should never need replacing.  But I've never had very good luck with this kind of bulb, so I'm a little skeptical about that.  I tried calling customer service to see what they would charge to replace the bulbs, but after the phone rang several times, I got an answering machine that said, \"\"Thank you.  Goodbye.\"\"  Doesn't exactly instill confidence in the company, does it?Oddly enough, my mirror arrived without any side mirrors.  The box doesn't mention them, nor does the instruction manual, but printed right on the appliance itself, above the mirror, it says \"\"ROTATE FLAT MIRROR UP TO CLOSE SIDE MIRROS.\"\"  I think I got a dud.  Or the wrong model.The one positive thing I can say about the product is that both the regular and the 5x mirror on the flip side have very good clarity.  But I suspect I'd be just as happy with a stand mirror that I could get far cheaper than the current $50 price tag on this product.  It's not horrible, but it just doesn't deliver any value or use over other mirrors.\"", "I sometimes like to sit outside of the bathroom and watch TV while getting ready, so I thought I'd give this lighted makeup mirror a try.  After using it a couple of times, I am completely underwhelmed.  The best part of the mirror is the two magnification settings that allow you to see really close up to do eyebrows, etc.  But that's about the only thing I'd use it for.  The mirror has different settings for different types of light, like daytime, evening, etc. Honestly, there was not much of a difference between any of them and I don't think they imitate realistic lighting situations at all.  More gimmicky than useful.  The unit is very large and cumbersome, made of plastic.  The slider that is used to change to different light settings is very flimsy plastic and gets stuck all the time.  For the price, it is extremely disappointing. That's my personal opinion, of course, maybe teenage girls might enjoy it but I'll be sticking with my regular mirror on the bathroom wall to do my make up.", "We did not receive the mirror in the picture.  The mirror we received does not have the folding side mirrors.  That being said, it is still a pretty good makeup mirror.  My wife and daughters use it and all like it.  It has 4 light settings, Day, Night, Office, Home with a rotating mirror.  One side is magnified.  The lights work well, the mirror is a good size.  The women in my house think the cord is plenty long.  The stand is adjustable, so you can decide how much lean you want in the mirror.  Good mirror for the price.", "The Jerdon Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror is a favorite of my wife and my daughter who needs glasses.Pros - According to them the settings are accurate when you are putting you your make-up for the office, the evening, and days outside.  The two side mirrors are helpful to folks whose vision isn't 20/20 or don't have the best peripheral vision.Neutral Comment - This mirror takes a bit more room with the side mirrors so if you plan on keeping it out for daily use, it is a good idea to have a dresser top or desk area for it.  The side-mirrors do fold-up easily, so you can condense the space but if you like having it handy, it is nice to know it takes a bit of room.Overall, very happy with the product.", "You know how when you need glasses and are used to all of the magnifying mirrors at home and then when you travel you don't have the same stuff and it's hard to pull yourself together? Ha. Well, I decided to get an extra magnifying mirror (this is my 2nd of the same one), and keep it with my packable stuff. It makes things easier.", "I got this for my wife and she loves it.  The tri-fold mirror is great and the illumination with the different settings is good.  A good price point for this particular mirror.", "My wife has been using this Jerdon makeup mirror.  It has some nice features with the multiple lighting options, mirror angles, and mirror magnification.What she doesn't like and I also noticed is it is bulky and hard to quickly store.  The center mirror spins around when trying to move it.  The cord does not have a cord wrap so you kind of just have to wrap it around the mirror.  Also the mirror stand fell apart during the first week of use - the metal stand pops out of the mirror slots and you have to put it back.So overall, useful for applying makeup.  But build quality and design could be a bit better for ease of use.  At around $50, I give it 3-stars for price/value.", "Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, White FinishI've been looking for a quality, lighted make-up mirror that is not too bulky and is lightweight enough to travel with.Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror is impressive right out of the box.A plastic white housing with an adjustable metal/plastic stand, easy flip make-up mirror (1X and 5X magnification)  that  uses cool florescent lighting.There is a plug-in (AC) outlet on the front of the mirror housing for a curling iron, blow drier (or, whatever).A simple slide lighting bar that allows one to choose proper lighting for different situations:  Day, Office, Evening or Home light. Very Nice!I think the plug-in cord is a bit bulky and stiff, but nothing that one cannot get used to.  Also, I noticed that the make-up mirror does slide around on smooth surfaces -- which is a need-to-know if one plugs anything into the front AC outlet (that may move around, in use) -- like a blow dryer.I found the Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror easy to use, travel with, apply make-up with.A Pleasure to use.

I love the different light settings- Makes such a huge difference when putting on makeup.. The only complaint is the stand seems a little too loose- I am always afraid it will fall over with a small push, so I ensure I put in a place in my bathroom that it will be sturdy- Otherwise very happy with this mirror- Such a huge difference seeing the different light settings.. Not sure how I went without for so long!", "The cool fluorescent bulbs are nice because they don't make me hot while I'm applying my makeup.  However, I don't care for the placement of the lights by the sides of my face.  The glare bothers my eyes.I do like that the light adjusts to color correct settings for day, night, office, and home. I can see how my makeup will look in those settings and apply accordingly.The mirror stands up by itself on the counter but it does take up a lot of counter space, and I don't like that I have to stoop down (even if I'm sitting in a chair--it's too low for me).I do like the built-in outlet for flat irons, blow dryers etc--it plugs in at the front of the unit.  I use it to charge my phone while I'm putting on my makeup.  I've found that I pull the mirror down if I use the unit outlet for my flat iron or blow dryer.", "My little girl is getting into makeup.  We made her a vanity and wanted a mirror to sit on top.  She loves this one!  It's compact and she can see what she is doing.  No more standing over the sink!  We love the lights on it as well.  She feels just like a little movie star in her own little dressing room!", "This makeup mirror lights up well, gives a variety of lights for different lighting experiences.  The magnification is great, if you want to really see yourself that close up!  I would recommend this mirror. I love that it folds up but rarely fold it out of convenience.", "If you want to obsess about your skin this is a great mirror.  It is also great for finding those hairs you just can't seem to find to pluck but know there are there.The footprint is nice when sides are folded so does not take up too much space when not in use.  The angle of the mirror can be adjusted which is helpful.My biggest complaint is that I wish the lights were brighter  - if you give them a few minutes to warm up they do seem a bit brighter.", "\"We are using the mirror for makeup applications prior to a photo shoot, often transporting it to shoot locations (when not being used for that, my daughters use it).The mirror measures about 14\"\" X 12\"\" X 4\"\" when folded.  I found the mirror to be very well constructed and well packaged. The mirror encasing is made of a white durable plastic and has a fold out kickstand in the back.  Side mirrors fold out smoothly. The mirror is lighted from all sides, with the lights on the side being a little dimmer, but of for our use (in complete darkness, I could see a problem).  The mirrors are very clear and magnification  of 1x to 5x is more than sufficient.  The outlet on the front of the mirror is also used far more than I thought it would beBeing a photographer, one of the features that caught my attention was the color settings. These color settings are \"\"in the ball park\"\" but not accurate for my purposes.  Really no big deal and not a deal breaker as after researching, I realize most mirrors will be off entirely or be within a wide-range.  We just use manual color balance when shooting.  We did not that the bulbs are not replaceable, which makes this a disposable item.  I do not know how long the bulbs will last and the instructions simply state they are \"\"long life.\"\"My daughters report they love the mirror.

Some other reviewers have noted some issues with the mirror, but it appears they received a different model in error.\"", "I had a mirror just like this that I got for my 16th birthday, 34 years ago (ouch!), I loved it and used it for years, finally getting rid of it when one of the bulbs burned out.I've been wanting another lighted mirror recently, and this one looked like exactly what I needed. Big enough to see my entire face, easy to use hands-free, side mirrors, and different light settings.Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and saw what looked exactly like my old favorite! This new version is a bit lighter weight, but doesn't feel cheap. The mirrors are very good quality and the light is nice and even without glare. Still perfect after all these years!", "I am serious about this - this is the best make up light I have ever used.The magnification is the best. The trifold, flip open view is great. I can see places I could not see as clearly in my previous 2 make up mirrors.It doesn't heat up (a problem with previous make-up mirrors). There's even a place to plug something into it, if you want. I like that it has a warranty. And it is much more stable than any of my previous mirrors too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! I hope it never breaks!", "I love the side mirrors for checking if my foundation is blended properly, and when I am straightening my hair. There are 4 different settings for the color tint of the lights, but I always use the daylight setting. It is brighter. Personal preference.As I am of a certain age, my eyes are not what they use to be, and I hate wearing my reading glasses while doing makeup. I find the 5x magnification ideal for applying eye liner, lip liner, and tweezing. I really love this feature. Also love the outlet on the front of the mirror.

The Jerdon mirror has a lot of nice features. It has an adjustable stand so you can set it up at whatever angle you'd like. It's lighted which I really like and it's a good sized rectangular mirror. I found that I can see more with this mirror then with my old round one and even with only 5x on the magnified side it's pretty comparable because of the lights.What I didn't really work for me were the light filters. Daylight is great but the other options - office, evening and home just didn't seem to be accurate - they were just different colored filters and I don't think I'd use them.

I seriously spent an hour with my new mirror. As my husband said, \"\"this is amazing\"\". Set up is 1-2-3 and you are ready to go right out of the box!  5 stars from me.

She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can't be replaced.
