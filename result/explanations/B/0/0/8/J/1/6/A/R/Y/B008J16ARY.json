I didn't know what I was getting into due to the lack of pre-release information and reviews, but I went ahead and went for it. The game isn't too bad for what it is, though it has its flaws.The graphics in this game are not your usual current gen graphics. They are more of a updated PS2 style of graphics. Not bad, but being 2013 you expect pretty scenery even if it is the end of the world and Zombies are taking over. The voice acting is subpar. You would think that being an AMC Films game that this wouldn't have been an issue.The game play is a little stiff and the combat is not very balanced. The \"\"Walkers\"\" in this game appear to be tougher than the ones on the show to which this game is a \"\"prequel\"\" to. You start with a knife, which a Walker will take 4 normal hits to the head before it goes down. This does not bode well if you have a mob of them coming after you. Later in the game you have access you guns and crossbows, but even then the reload times and shoddy aiming put you in a tough spot when you have a mob after you.Walkers seem to appear out of nowhere. If you think you have cleared an area so that you can move forward without incident, think again. Before you know it there will be one right behind you just waiting to sink their teeth into you. Being a First Person View type of game makes it difficult in this area since you can't get a good feel for your surroundings. You have to rely on stealth which is not good since you can't see everything that is going on around you due to the materializing Walkers and the first person view.There are collectables to be had, team members to be found and side quests. These are not too hard to find as the game is pretty linear. There is also no Co-Op/Multiplayer which doesn't bother me as I prefer to play alone.This is not a bad game. It is challenging. I have a feeling that production was rushed for whatever reason but the game is still playable. Fans of the series should enjoy it, though it could have been a much better game.\"", "They should be ashamed of themselves for just trying to cash in instead of allowing production time to come out with something decent.  I woulda bought it if it was worth it,  this is only worth a rental though.", "Ok so I am not like, -the- most hardcore gamer in the world (well my xbl score is 32,812 so I'm no slouch either) and FPS's usually kind of bore me, but I love zombies, I love the Walking Dead, and I hate games that aren't -fun-. Like, I found Dead Space 2 to be tedious, it made you work for everything and there was no real fun to it. It was pretty, but painful, like a bad date.The Walking Dead Survival Instinct is not the best game in the world, it's not gonna win any awards for innovation or graphics, but it's fun and it's obviously totally geared toward fans of the show. The TellTale game immersed us in the comic universe, and Survival Instinct does the same for the TV universe.Honestly a lot of the reviews I've seen on youtube or kotaku (who lost all credibility when they said if you wanted a good Southern Zombie game to play L4D2 which is awful as we all know) just seemed like they were aiming for all the low hanging fruit they could find. Yeah this game is a cheapish TV tie-in that rests on its laurels, but 99.99999999999% of the time that is exactly the case with franchise tie-ins. Chances of getting a game on par with Bioshock or Limbo out of an existing IP is pretty unrealistic IMO, and I feel like a lot of people are hating on this specifically because this is -the- game to hate on this season. Like people complaining about the grapple mode, considering this is essentially a stealth game, you're not really SUPPOSED to get into the grapple sequences, let along enjoy them.So here's my breakdown:1) graphics - eh, better than Left 4 Dead but does look like early console titles2) voice acting - sparse but quite good3) plot - thin but ties into the show and fleshes out the relationship between the dixon bros4) gameplay - pretty simplistic with a range of melee or ranged weapons that are pretty easy to cycle through. no weapon degradation5) zombie AI - fine by me. people have complained that the walkers seem stupid but THEY ARE ZOMBIES WHAT DO YOU WANT? Also the zombies models are lacking as there seem to be maybe 10 unique zombies (not that this isn't also the case in L4D)6) length- it's pretty short but offers rewards for replay. since you have alternate routes to traverse it makes playing through a couple times more desirableTo me this game is a fusion of Oregon Trail and Dead Island, both are games that I enjoy. You have to figure out who to keep, how to keep them alive, and how to ration out supplies. It's not an overly complex game, but again it's enjoyable if you want to spent time shredding zombies up with a machete or crossbow.For real, I think this game is unfairly maligned because I feel like the wrong audience is reviewing it. Hardcore gamers who want up date games that push their console to the limit are not going to enjoy this. Norman Reedus fangirls and fans of the show are going to enjoy it because it provides backstory and fairy simplistic fighting mechanics making it easy to play regardless of where you fall on the gamer spectrum (unless you only play zynga games or some nonsense).So yeah, I went into this with suuuuuuuper low expectations and was pleasantly surprised since I was expecting something super glitchy (i haven't run into any really massive bugs) and awful, and it's just a pretty simple game where you run around either hiding from or slashing zombies. But I do feel that this is really made for the fans of the series.", "I was contemplating giving this review a title Pathetic Game, but settled on Poorly Designed Game. I love the real AMC TV show, and October cannot come fast enough. All I can say is, even the cover is wrong on this one as they claim it is based on the AMC TV Show. The only relation to the TV show at all besides the name is the music, the main character name, zombies, and voices. Otherwise its nothing like the TV show at all.There are a lot of low rated reviews here and I have to agree with most of them and what they have to say. The graphics leave some to be desired. They are dated and Activision should have been able to do much better rendering of the scenes. But they were not that bad, and the game is playable with the poor graphics. My biggest beef is with the save points. Pathetic. Whom ever designed this part of the game should be fired immediately. What kind of moron designs a game with one major save point in a mission??Basically, at some half way point, which many times you are unaware of, the game will place a restart point. It will not SAVE the game, its just a restart point. This is also dumber than a rock. In other words if you do not have hours to play all the way through an entire mission, and you have to exit the game, next time you play, ALL progress will be LOST. Even if you make it to a check point. I got so tired of playing the same area over and over and over and over and over again from the beginning or last check point because of the poor design of this game.In the hospital for example at first I examined each room looking for moving zombies, and much needed supplies. I got pretty far the first round, I got into the cafeteria then got mobbed by 8 zombies at once. I had to start over from the beginning. I had to do this repeatedly until I figured out how to safely clear the cafeteria and the following hall. Then finally I got to a check point after running down the foggy hallway and ending up crashing through the floor into a room with, active zombies of course. In that entire first section before the check point there were plenty of zombies that would take huge amounts of health and they were not even close enough to attack or shove away. WTF?? There is one measly soda for health available. The second leg is worse, you have to get out of the room you dropped into with the active zombies in it and run down the hall to a room where you find some guy who wants to help, and you cannot accept his help or even talk to him, so why bother? Plenty of ammo in that room, cannot use it though, or you'll draw dozens of zombies, and of course NO health items at all. You have to run down the other end of the hall into a meeting room to find another measly soda, and more useless ammo.That is just an example of how poorly the game design was in this game. Ammo you cannot use or you draw dozens of zombies. Little to NO health items. Zombies that take huge chunks of health off, that you cannot run away from. Shoving does not help at all. They either will not lose grip on you, or bounce right back faster than you can turn and run. When you have to deal with more than one or two, consider yourself dead. You have no chance of getting away alive, and if by chance you do, there is no health what so ever to be found so the next zombie that you happen to encounter only needs to look your way at close quarters and your dead... back to the beginning to play it all over again. BORING!!!!  The controls are stupid. Game designers who are stupid enough to design a two stick control scheme should be banned from the industry. Yes, you need to control Daryl with two sticks. The left one controls forward and backward while the right one controls turning. If a zombie attacks you from the side you lose most of your health trying to turn around to face them otherwise you inflict no damage if and when you can get to those controls because you were using your right hand to try to turn when you should have been attacking while you turned. Lastly, you can clear a room , lock the doors, and zombies appear out of nowhere. Of course, unlike the show, they make no noise what so ever, its all of a sudden a huge chunk of health goes away as they start into you. What is up with the other survivors thing? They are useless!! They cannot help you,they cannot do anything. Half the time they are gone when you get back or failed their mission.The only thing they did get right with this game was the creepy. It is about as creepy as you can get knowing they are everywhere, and can appear or animate at any time. Dark places, dangers, you never know what is behind the next door or partition. Unfortunately the bad aspects of this game negate anything the creepy can do for it.If they were real game designers, they would have had save game points every new room or end of hall area or at least in every new large room or something. Going back to the beginning was boring and frustrating. There would be no appearances of zombies in rooms that were cleaned and closed off. There would be more opportunities to use guns and not attract more than one or two zombies instead of 20. Less health damage to Daryl each contact, and much easier to take out a zombie with a basic weapon like the knife. Some way to take on multiple zombies and live, or better yet break way and hide. One stick control! There would be much more health scattered about.Over all, I found this game frustrating mostly because of being sent back repeatedly to the beginning when killed. Mission areas between restart points were too long and if you go very far into it then died, you had to go all the way back to the beginning. Stupid. Total lack of health to be found. If I'm going through room and areas rummaging, toss us a frigging bone and give us some health rewards! I would not recommend this game, not unless you pick it up on the $9.99 rack.", "im a big fan of walking dead I'm also a fan of video games&#8230;&#8230; but this game needs a lot more work.", "I was forced to delete my first review of this game, my opinion changed a lot after getting more time in on it...I have a couple hours wrapped up in this game, but I have lost all desire to finish it. It has just become so repetitive that I'm bored out of my mind. Boxing it up to trade in to amazon as I write this review. I enjoyed the first act, but after that I was just not even sure what the overall objective was in the game...You drive to one spot... kill zombies... find new weapons, and maybe a new person. Drive to next spot... passanger dies because you sent them out with a weapon that they're not good with to collect gas, food, or ammo, and this just seems to be an on going thing. It's not really fun at all.I was also able to try out the herd mode because I ordered from gamestop. It's just like COD zombies without the bells and whistles. No power-ups or anything of that sort, which I kinda like... you start out in one zone, and after every few waves a new area opens up. The biggest shock about this for me was that it's only single player, the draw for COD zombies is getting your friends together to play. I also found a spot where I could hide where zombies couldn't touch me, I made it to wave 33 like this, and only died because I decided I didn't feel like playing anymore. I pretty much could have went on forever like this...So this mode is flawed, and I doubt it will ever get patched.Overall the game is just incomplete, and a letdown. I hate to admit it, but like everyone said... It's just another quick cash-in by activision.", "I am a huge Walking Dead fan so had high hopes for this game.  It failed miserably on all fronts.  the graphics are terrible.  The gameplay is totally linear practically a rail shooter.  The zombies pop up out of nowhere and completely overwhelm at every turn which makes it very frustrating but I guess that is the only thing that keeps you from completing the game in about 15 minutes.  It's short no matter how you play it.  You have a few options that don't really end up making that much of a difference in the long run because the game just doesn't go anywhere.  Like an idiot I kept at it, kept trying to find some redeeming feature and just as the survivors are getting airlifted and you think that maybe this is where the good stuff starts, the games ends.  The gamer is playing as Daryl Dixon.  He goes through a few towns, meets up with his brother Merle and finds a few survivors. There is no strategy, few chances offered to outsmart the zombies.  Your options are mainly just blowing heads off or running.  Activision obviously made this game to cash in on the popularity of the television series right now but it's not worth your time or money.  TellTale games has a great Walking Dead game series going on.  I'm waiting for the next installment.  It's a DLC series.  It lives up to the name Walking Dead.  There are so many good zombie games out there, Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dead Rising.  I don't understand why Activision couldn't have taken some cues from some of the existing games and done better with this one.  It truly just sucks.  The voices of the actors for Darryl and Merle from the show were the only good part of the game and earned it one extra star. But please don't waste your money or time on this one.", "As far as Activision is concerned, it's rather obvious that this project was nothing more than a cash in on the Walking Dead name. This is Activision afterall, no reason to be surprised. However, i feel the developer made the best game they could, with the limited resources that were provided to them. Activision could have a great game on thier hands, if they were more proactive in supporting thier developer, and poured more money into this project. As far as the game goes, it's really fun. Though rough around the edges. Many have said that the visuals are 2006 era, and i would tend to agree. The game controls fine though, and i really enjoy the added emphasis on stealth, tactical thinking, resource management, and survival. I was afraid that this would end up being some generic Left for Dead knockoff, and i am happy to report that it isn't. The Dixon brothers are represnted well here. And it does introduce some interesting mechanics, namely the travel and survivor team systems. Some may have wanted multiplayer, but not every genre benefits from that. This is especially true with horror, it seems. I feel that Activision didn't really care if this game was good or not. They were just in it for the payday. This is basically a small victory for the developer. Who managed to make a decent game, without proper support from it's publisher.PROS:+ I really enjoyed the pacing of the game. Stealth and patience are encouraged during many sections. And when combat does heat up, it can be rather intense.+ Even though the game isn't very scary, it does rely on traditional survival horror elements. Such as resource management, and slower pacing.+ I preferred the emphasis on melee combat. Encounters felt more threatening, and finishing off walkers was satisfying.+ I am glad that the typical zombie assortment was left out. No spitters or bloaters, or whatever. It helped the game feel more realistic.+ Two actors from the AMC series reprise their roles.CONS:- The graphics are extremely dated. Some of these textures are simply butt ugly.- The enemy AI is less than brilliant. Granted, these are zombies we're talking about. But when you observe one spinning in place, or continuously walking into walls...you get the looming suspicion that this is a result of poor game design ;-).- The game can be a bit buggy, although it never locked up on me (cough... Fallout NV... cough).- Though there are some interesting concepts being utilized here, most feel half backed. I am referring to survivor management and supply raids, that are located off the beaten path. Usually in gas stations or campsites. If your lucky, maybe even a small town or school. I always had fun with these, but couldn't shake the feeling that more development time should have been devoted to this. I guess this could be said about the game as a whole though.- The story barely has a presence in this game. Don't expect anything near the quality of the tv series or comics.- Though this is technically a budget title, $50 is simply too expensive for this.VERDICT:I had a good time with this game, though problems are a plenty! If you can find it for cheap (no more than $20) and enjoy horror/zombie titles, then I can offer a mild recommendation.6/10", "I love this show and the game is just as good. I do wish there were more levels but that's ok. A+", "honestly the gameplay is fun and challenging, now this isnt a game for people who have ot have the best of graphics or storyline, zombie killing is somewhat realistic as in its all headshots and if you use a gun the zombies will come a flocking. downside is you dont get crossbow till last third of  game. overall if your a walking dead fan and can deal with ps2/ xbox graphics and cheesy storyline, this game is golden", "\"As a zombie enthusiast, I've liked the Walking Dead AMC TV show. It remains true to the Romero shambling/walking, survival horror genre. So, when a game is made by the same title, you'd expect that, at the least, the zombies would remain true to their nature in this Walking Dead mythos. You'd be wrong.While not the biggest complaint I have, the game should rightfully be called the Jogging Dead. That the zombies run at you, could have been a minor annoyance, if not for the slew of other obvious let downs in this product.The dated graphics are the first thing you will notice. They might be considered good on the original XBox, as for the XBox 360, they are exceptionally dated. The terrain is simple, the stages are pretty small. Even their LOD system for textures seems to be broken - at only about 7 feet away from your character textures look blurry.The pace of the zombies, as I've already mentioned, is not of the \"\"walking\"\" nature. They pretty much jog. Stealth works marginally well, however, where this game breaks a cardinal rule of stealth and survival horror games is that, even simply turning your back on an area/room you cleared can result in zombies spawning behind you. You can clear a room completely, close all the doors, and return to a room full of zombies. IT has limited ammo, as a proper survival horror should, however, it's random spawning is a huge let down.I was very excited to see an element used in this game that I hadn't seen done in years, and out of stage over-world map traversing system, with the possibility for random encounters and events. Once you leave an area, you get to choose where you will go next. You can customize your experience to maximize your travel speed, at the loss of possible random encounters, or vice versa. Here was a great opportunity for this title to shine. However, the random encounters are all pretty much the same - very limited in what you can find, and even the stages look all the same (a bout 5 different random locations, give or take). It is very similar to what the 1998 Fallout 2 game did, however, in this Walking Dead version, most of the time you only get one choice of destination. When you get a choice, it's between two locations, and there is no back tracking. It's really just a slightly branching path. The encounters are more boring then they are worth.You have a limited inventory, and it looks like no way to increase your personal store. Nor can you get your other team members to literally pull their own weight. This could be less frustrating if you could return to your vehicle and swap out inventory. This is just another indicator of the stage-by-stage design of this game.This, AMC Walking Dead game, has, in the end, many minor problems, or more, poorly implemented features - each of which, in of themselves, could be overlooked if this product did anything that it does do, better. However, it's just not exceptional in any way. And, for a 360 title, it's not even average. The production value is far less than I would expect, even if it were an XBox Arcade title. Doom 2 had more depth and freedom than this title. Wait for the price to hit the single digits, which I am predicting will happen in less than two months, then it's worth a look.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.09053618460893631, 0.14737892150878906, 0.14254769682884216, 0.07897476851940155, 0.12095677852630615, 0.023974915966391563, 0.08777565509080887, 0.04990088939666748, 0.0038755147252231836, 0.11977115273475647, 0.11603372544050217, 0.018273724243044853]]}
