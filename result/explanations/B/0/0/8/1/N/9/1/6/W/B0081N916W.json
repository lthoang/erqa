This receiver does everything I wanted it to do and much more. The interface is simple and clear and easy to operate. Setup is a cinch--just plug in the HDMI cable in the back and you are ready to go. Some might think 50 watts of power isn't good enough, but for my small attack it's plenty of power.", "This receiver is truly amazing.  It was incredibly easy to hook up.  Literally just a few moments after opening the box, I had it connected to my system.  I have loved the ongoing utility and performance of this unit.  It has 6 HDMI ports, SIX!  There is one on the front, that I thought would go unused, but we have gotten in the habit of connecting our camcorder to the receiver.  It is incredibly easy to then see pictures and events almost as soon as the images are captured.I have not had any performance issues at all.  Heat is not an issue, the sound quality is exemplary.  So, to summarize, easy to use, great ongoing utility, great sound, really what more is there to ask for?  You will not regret this purchase.", "I've owned theSony STRDN1030 Wi-Fi Network A/V Receiverfor some time now and I'd like to compare this Marantz receiver to my Sony.  (Edit: 5/29/13 - This Marantz receiver has recently dropped in price.  It used to be $250 more than the Sony STRDN1030.)Networking capabilities:Both have networking capabilities, like playing internet radio, Pandora, or listening to your local media library through your network.  The Sony allows both wired and Wi-Fi connections, while the Marantz only has a wired connection and no Wi-Fi.  However, they both work well in regards to their networking features.Remote apps:Both have their own smartphone apps.  I have an Android phone, and both apps work well, and the receivers respond quickly to the commands.Bluetooth:The Sony allows you to stream Bluetooth music to it.  This Marantz receiver does not.Audio and video quality:I've used both receivers with myEnergy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System (Set of Six, Black)and both have the same video quality and sound, especially once you use their automatic calibration microphones and tweak the results a bit.GUI (menu appearances):No contest here.  The Marantz absolutely blows the Sony away.  This is the only major downside to the Sony in my (and many others') opinion.  The Sony GUI is terrible... it is slow and only fits a certain amount of characters on the screen at a time and scrolls the rest very slowly.  The Marantz GUI is much better and faster.Build quality:The Marantz seems to have a better quality build to it.  But I do not have enough experience with Marantz receivers to know how well built the internals are.There some other differences between the two receivers, like how the Marantz is shorter than the Sony, and that the Marantz has a HDMI port on the front and the Sony does not.  But if you are looking for a receiver that has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, I would look at the Sony STRDN1030 or theOnkyo TX-NR626 7.2-Channel Network Audio/Video Receiver (Black).", "\"This really is a beautiful, sleek piece of equipment and it definitely was time to replace my old Sony receiver. I was able to reduce the mess of composite wires and cables behind my stereo cabinet to just some power and HDMI cables.Set up was relatively easy. I have only a center speaker, two front speakers, and two rear speakers. (A subwoofer is in my shopping cart.) The Audyssey set up was somewhat frustrating. As I would go through the speaker setup, I was asked which speakers I had; however, when it came time to send the signal to each speaker, the system tried to send signals to speakers I clearly said I didn't have, particularly the two side speakers. I was never able to complete the Audyssey setup, as I was told to check my speaker connections. That was very frustrating, but I was able to manually adjust the sound levels of my speakers and move on.The first movie I watched with the new system was Titanic in 3D. The sound was fabulous and I can't wait to add a speaker or three.The most annoying aspect is the lack of wireless capability. My system is too far away from my router to even consider connecting via ethernet. I have ordered, but have not yet tried, a network adapter. I want to be able to listen to more than what's on my computer in iTunes with AirPlay -- options like Pandora or Sirius/XM. Both my TV and Blu Ray player have wireless capability, so it isn't absolutely necessary to have it, but it seems like a huge miss with this product.I love the remote. It's easy to use and to choose the proper input, rather than scrolling through the choices. Although it is possible to control the receiver with my smart phone, the remote is all I need.The USB port in the front of receiver not only plays my iPod's music, but it also serves as a charger. If you're wondering, there is no video associated with it, like menus or \"\"now playing.\"\" That's to be expected, though.I've experimented with the HDMI port on the front, too. With my Galaxy Tab, the screen shows on the TV immediately, mimicking everything on my Tab, starting on the home page and continuing as I scroll through the apps. Audio and video are perfect. With my iPad 1, only videos, like YouTube, show on the screen. Otherwise, the TV screen is blank. For the iPad or the Galaxy Tab, you'll need to buy a special A/V HDMI cable adapter, specific to each. Remember that they also must be plugged into power. The adapters have ports to handle that.All-in-all, a pretty nice receiver, and wifi would have made it a five star review.\"", "Pros: Love the low profile - after years of giant A/V boxes this is a refreshing change that looks great and more importantly frees up some much needed room in my cabinet. It's also not quite as deep as my old Onkyo.It sounds great. Don't let the &#34;low&#34; wattage fool you, this thing can still pump out some serious volume, quality over quantity.It's flexible - 6 HDMI ports, including a very handy one on the front - wish more A/V receivers would do this. All ports pass 3D/Deep color/etc. No 4k support (though technically, every other receiver that claims to do so also only supports HDMI 1.4/10.2gb like this one and not HDMI 2.0/18gb which has yet to be ratified so I guess it depends on your definition of &#34;4K&#34; - I suspect the 1603 would handle current 4k displays and content just fine)Has what you need doesn't have what you don't: If you want Analog upscaling or powered Zone 2/3 support, etc then this isn't the receiver for you. If you don't need those things you'll appreciate not having to pay for them and having the money instead go towards a quality single-site setup.Lots of streaming options. I tested a few like Pandora. I sort of don't get this - there are a million and one other ways to stream music out there, hell the thing has Airplay and USB, just use your iDevice or other player of choice - but they are there if you want them.Interface looks nice. It's refreshing to see newer A/V receivers coming with nice, hi-res interfaces over HDMI. Even the on screen volume control looks good on my 106 Front Projected screen.Setup is a snap.Cons(?) None, really. Maybe Audessy calibration? As is the case with any receiver I have used with this feature, calibrating with the built in mic is only so-so. Run it through its paces and then get a decent meter ($20 at Radio Shack) or one of the free phone apps and adjust it yourself, it's not hard, and it can make a big difference.It doesn't make me breakfast?Overall, great little receiver. Very happy with it so far. Pair it with some decent speakers that sound good to you (everyone is different) and you'll have a great system.", "I received this item through the Amazon Vine Program.  This receiver switches multiple (6 HDMI connections when you include the one on the front panel) inputs to a single HDMI output.  As it does this, it also switches the audio for each input to the amplifier for output to your speakers.  This is a real plus if you happen to own an older flat screen TV that only has a single HDMI input and composite inputs, such as I have in a room that has my bicycle trainer in.By using this unit I am now able to use HDMI cables to connect my Blue Ray player, my game system, and my bicycle program to my flat screen without all of the cables (RGB cables and audio) that was necessary before.  As well, I also have a much better audio system than I had before.Let me tell you why I love this system:1.  Weight, construction, and color:  This unit is very solid, has nice construction, and is a gloss black that goes with all of my other black equipment, including my black Bose Speakers (501s).2.  Ease of connection and programming:  This system uses a very simple on screen method to help you connect everything and to then test out the speaker system.  It selects, depending upon your input, how many speaker ports to operate and what type of system you have.  No need to worry about not having a center channel speaker or that you only have front speakers, the system adjusts its output so you do not have to worry out terminating the outputs of speaker terminals that you do not use.  The system then uses a microphone (included that plugs into the front of the unit) to send out tones to balance the system and to set the response for the speakers.If you decide that you need to reprogram the output or input for a selection (say your SAT input) you can easily do it with onscreen help.  This has to be the most flexible system I have ever come across.  While it supports a wide array of options, it is not overwhelming in operation to accomplish the task you wish to accomplish.3.  Internet Radio:  This is a real plus for me!  The programming guide supplies you with selections from Marantz, selections base upon genre of music, and it also allows you to enter in your own selections of stations.  Now, expand this menu to include local stations and global stations and you have the entire world at your fingertips!4.  Output:  While this is only a 50 watt per channel unit (RMS folks and NOT PIP), it is more than sufficient to rattle the walls and windows in a 25 by 30 foot room!  My Bose 501 speakers have no problem being powered by this unit. If I was going to say there was an issue, it is probably that you are 25% of the way on the volume control before the sound is really noticable.  That is more due to the minimum power requirement of my BOSE speakers to operate than of a problem with this amplifier.  By the time you are 60% of the way on the volume control you can hear the music clearly next door!5.  Remote:  This remote is well constructed and I feel the layout is more intuitive than many others.  Still, it is a busy surface with all of the options on it for your unit.  Take time to try out each feature.Detractors:The only real detractor is the fact that the Internet connection is wire based and not wireless.  The description of the receiver is very clear about this being a wired system so there was no surprise when it arrived.  I just think it would have been nice to include it in the system when you are spending as much money as you are especially when almost all new TVs,Blue Ray players, Game Consoles and such are wireless.  I used a pair of Monster Powernet 200's to obtain a Internet connection over my house wiring since my router was 3 rooms and one floor away from this receiver.  A fairly simple solution, but not the least expensive way to go.If you are looking for an outstanding entertainment audio system and can deal with a wired Internet connection, I would highly recommend this unit to you!", "Let me first say, that I have had a nightmare with receivers particularly 2 Onyko's which were good sound-wise but simply wouldn't switch anything through the HDMI.  This Marantz changes everything, from the moment I got this I can tell the difference in class.  The video switching is perfection and the sound quality is excellent.The great thing too about this receiver is that it is easy to connect up, I have the full 7.1 speaker set up plus a Blu-Ray Player, an HD-DVD Player, a 5 Disc DVD Player, a Multi-region/Multi-system DVD Player and a Playstation 3 plus my daughter uses a VSmile Console.  I also have a Laserdisc Player but I haven't connected this yet but this receiver has plenty of options.  With the help of the on-screen menus, you can easily set up and assign everything plus you can ensure that all your speakers are connected correctly by testing everything with the sound check.I have tested this receiver with everything including Super Audio CD's, DVD Audio CD's and 7.1 DTS Master Audio Blu-Rays.  The sound quality is sensational and the receiver just likes to perform and will handle anything.  The remarkable thing too is that the video quality matches the sound quality.  I haven't had a receiver perform better overall.  The other thing I like is that everything is kept basic, there isn't 10 different buttons, you just rotate a control to select your choice of device and turn up the volume.  This is the essence of true audio, a good receiver doesn't need a bass or treble control etc, if it is truly great then the sound will not need adjusting to compensate for this or that.  I have it set to direct audio and I am away.  Don't get me wrong this receiver has multiple options to embrace all the current technologies so it will suit both the techies and people who just want to keep things basic.  My one concession is to use the standby feature which will turn the receiver off if I am not using it.  This is a nice option.Truly this receiver is a delight especially after my previous experiences with Onkyo and it brings Marantz back to the forefront of providing quality high-end audio products.", "I'd been using the NR1403 for the last 6 months, which was a huge improvement over the Onkyo it replaced, so I was hoping the 1603 would be another huge step forward. The 1603 improves upon & adds quite a few options not available on the 1403, some are small improvements (better GUI, more customization options, updated face, etc.), and some big ones (7.1 vs 6.1, 7 HDMI vs 6, USB port, networking, built-in Pandora, SiriusXM, Spotify, Android app, etc.). I've only had it for a couple days, compared to the 6 months with the 1403, but so far, I haven't noticed any significant difference in A/V quality. The improvements & additions are great, though, but whether or not they're worth the additional 250 dollars really depends on how important those features are to you.Another noteworthy detail is the 3-year warranty, compared to the industry standard 2-year warranties from Denon, Yamaha, Onkyo, Sony, and others.The Android app is pretty good - ignore the ratings on Google Play. Apparently, some people who have higher-end Marantz receivers are angry because the app doesn't work with those models (nor is it advertised as such). For some reason, they think it's perfectly reasonable to give the app 1 star because it wasn't made to work with their equipment.", "We use this receiver to manage the sound of:5 flush ceiling mounted Polk speakers in our living room. (Zone 1)2 wall mounted outdoor speakers on our back patio/ pool area.  (Zone 2)We have our blu-ray player, roku player, mp3 player and high def 3D flat screen TV connected through it.It was easy to set up and program and has been working beautifully for about two weeks now. The only complaint I have is that Zone 2 requires an analog connection with the player (any player). It will not work with an HDMI connection or other digital connection. This was okay for us because we don't need surround sound on our back patio and we don't want to pile on another gadget to handle multiple zones. We have the Bluray player connected with digital and analog. We daisy chain the mp3 player to the bluray to play music on the patio.This receiver is indeed much smaller than it past counterparts. It is about the same size as an old VHS player (for those that know what a VHS is ;-).We are happy with it and would recommend.Thanks for reading.
