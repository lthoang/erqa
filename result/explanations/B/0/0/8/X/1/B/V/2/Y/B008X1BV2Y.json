Our baseline is a 42\"\" Panasonic plasma display. This projector launches a wonderful large screen in any reasonably dark room at a high enough definition that it looks at least as good as our somewhat-older plasma, but _much_ larger. The brightness is more than adequate, as is the sharpness for Amazon Instant Video and \"\"other\"\" streaming purchases.The speaker leaves something to be desired, though. If you're in a totally quiet area, it's fine, but if there is any outside noise you will need external speakers.Something the other reviewers haven't mentioned is that the projector is also flat on the backside. This feature means that if you want to project onto the ceiling, that is easy to set up and enables bed viewing...Also, it's a very small unit. It's slightly larger than the palm of my hand, something that doesn't come across in the 3M ad copy, but means that the wife and I will probably bring it with us on trips of any decent length, since it gives us a nice screen without taking up much bag space or requiring us to hope the hotel TV has an HDMI in for one of our devices.\"", "\"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this projector, I guess somewhere in my mind I thought about big, heavy, office style huge DLP machines with lots of cables.I was therefore taken aback when the outer package containing everything arrived measuring just over 4\"\" x 7\"\"Inside, a small white box about the size of two cigarette packets side by side, and a ROKU USB stick, that looked almost as big as the unit.Setup = simplePlug in the ROKU stickTurn it onPoint it at a blank light colored wallTweak the focus wheelTurn up the volume [I'll come back to that]After it's warmed up, it looks for your wireless network, asks for passwords and so on to connect to the internet, and then you must activate it from your PC.If you have a ROKU account fine, if not it's a simple online registration (you will need a credit card on file although no purchases are necessary)Punch in the code from the screen (your wall) into your PC and you're done.Straight off it asks you if you want all the free stuff activated, I said yes, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Pandora, Facebook, Disney etc. etc.Later you can link your Netflix and Amazon accounts if you have them with passwords and so on for instant access.Remember I said I would come back to sound? Well it has an integral speaker, it's OK but small, and you won't hear much, headphones or external speakers via a standard 3.5mm jack work fine.Picture is great, and depends on what you are watching of course for quality and resolution.It's worth mentioning at this point that you can forget VUDU - you need a higher level ROKU box with HDX compatibility, it didn't even show up on my list, even after I checked it on the free page.PROSCompletely portable, and only confined by the range of the wireless network it's using, it's also rechargeable if you have no outlet - the battery will run for about two hours, good for most moviesThere's a ton of free TV and movies, or use your existing accounts, simpleDid I say it was small already?Will show up to 120\"\" wide with claritySo far Iron Man 2, Rango, and TV show Flashpoint look great on a standard wall.CONSRemote feels small and fiddlyFocus wheel is tiny, and needs adjustment between different things, for example when I went from Netflix to Amazon, I had to adjust, even though the projector hadn't moved.It's very small, and although that's also a plus, you will need to prop it on a box for required viewing height, not a big negative, just a fact. It does however have a standard screw hole underneath that will attache to most tripods.A little priceyNow you don't have to take a movie to your friends, take the whole package! Pick a big flat light colored surface and fire it up! - Jeez, if it's warm, sit outside and watch it on the side of the house or the garage door if you want!It seems technology is getting smaller everywhere, will products like this put an end to giant flat screen TV's? I doubt it just yet, but this is so nice to take to any room in your house with a blank wall and watch your favorite shows and movies - it has to be 5 stars\"", "I'm a Vine reviewer, but I did NOT get any of our Roku's as part of Vine. We purchased each and every one of them, and don't regret buying any of them, and we currently have 6 of them. One is with a child who has graduated from college and moved away, the other is with a child still in college. We have 3 regular Roku's, and the Roku projector - ours is mounted on a tripod.There are really only 2 things to consider before you buy the projector. One is where will you place it/mount it, or will it be more mobile? And do you already have a screen? If not get a white screen, not a tinted screen, and don't plan to play movies on a wall. You just won't get the quality you would with a good white screen.I would highly recommend this, as well as any of the Roku products!", "\"I love Roku - it is the best set-up box for media streaming. In an age where it seems even our remotes have \"\"smart\"\" apps and can stream from Netflix or Amazon, the Roku is the device that is simple to use, and \"\"just works.\"\"So I was very excited about this device - Roku anywhere, with a nice large image to enjoy. I looked forward to using it on vacation with the kids, at home if we needed another screen somewhere, and at parties to add a bit of 'multimedia' art to the scene. Just kidding!What I have found after using it in many of these situations and occasions is that there are some serious shortcomings, but they are not all due to the the project itself.Non-product-related issues include:* few good projection spaces... I have ended up projecting this onto the ceiling on several occasion as that was the only surface with a 2x3 or larger free space in our hotel rooms on vacation, and even at home* Hotel and condo internet is sometimes not good enough to stream videosProduct-related issues include:* Roku only - I tried to connect this to other devices through HDMI (a Blu Ray player, another Roku, and my phone), and it did not work. The Roku is just the standard \"\"stick\"\" Roku, and is removable, so there is an HDMI port on the projector itself, but I could not get it to work.* fan is sort of loud, but not too bad - seems to run all the time, though.What is pretty awesome about this product:* The Image! It is brighter and of higher quality than I anticipated. It really is watchable (in a dark room) and projects a sharp and clear image to about 3-4 feet across* The Sound! No, it isn't great by any means, and it was always helped with external speakers, but the built in sound is sufficient to watch a movie, even in a larger room with 8 kids! They stayed engaged and watched a full movie with the built-in speakers!* The Size and Convenience! The projector itself is basically \"\"palm-sized\"\" and the remote is a standard \"\"credit card\"\" style remote. The wall wart is also compact. It packs into a suitcase or even backpack easily, and I have not worried taking it on flights with me. The remote controls both the projector itself, and the Roku. That parts work flawlessly.So why three stars? If you are are aware of the limitations of a portable projector (nowhere good to project it, possibly bad Internet), and understand it needs to be watched in a dark room, and will benefit from external speakers, then I would give this four or five stars. I feel those limitations, while not with the product itself, need to made clear to possible buyers.\"", "Having this small projector device with Roku is an excellent combination!The plus:1. Extremely portable, very small and battery powered (AC adaptor included).2. Roku Streaming Stick.3. HDMI port on the projector will let you output any HDMI input.4. Built in speakers (though not great, does the job just fine), there is a 3.5 audio out port for external speakers.The negatives:1. The brightness is not very bright when projected on a white wall (I am looking for a portable projector screen to test image quality).2. The sharpness is not quite there as well, DVD quality, but coming from such a small package, it is amazing!3. The remote control is very small (too small in my opinion) but it goes with the portable theme.4. Fan is slightly loud.For those interested in purchasing this item, you will get an awesome combination of portability and streaming capabilities, however don't expect 1080p quality. This device boots up to 720p output from what the screen shows once booted, but expect a slightly dulled projection display brightness and sharpness and you will be very happy, I am.", "The truth is I don't &#34;hate&#34; the AAX4 device, its just simply substandard to my expectations and in comparison to Brookstone and Roku. After purchasing AAX4 product due to the high star rating I'm seriously disappoint at that projector and perplexed as to WTH everyone else is talking about in liking it over ROKU.Perhaps it because I hold things to a higher standard but I've test this one, the brookstone and the Roku and to me the Roku is a serious NO BRAINER. I've outlined the distinctions in order of what I found important below1. WIRELESS STREAMING!!! -- ONLY ROKU!! If you do NOT know about Roku GOOGLE BABY!! Its basically Apple TV done right! Faaar better than Apple TV and in fact the forerunner and trendsetter for all the steaming devices out now.2. LUMENS- technically different however I could tell NO DIFFERENCE between this and the Roku (the Brookstone picture quality was a bit better). Who's measuring the lumens on these devices anyway? Seems to me there needs to ONE nonaffiliated 3rd party that measures all devices equally because if Roku is stating 60 yet AAX4 is stating 85 &#8230; well someone's clearly lying. Either Roku is bashfully rounding way down or AAX4 is boastfully rounding way up.3. REMOTE CONTROL - I kinda thought remotes were no brainers are really wouldn't be a competitive advantage in these products but WOW was I wrong. In short, only the Roku was flawless with the remote AND you can download a better remote onto your smart phone (AAX4 and Brookstone CANNOT beat that!). AAX4 is just some B.S. and annoying (only works at VERY specific angles).4. SOUND - This is low on my &#34;I give a damn&#34; list because they all have Auxillary ports and I just jack in a nice speaker anyhow. However the Roku is the only one of the 3 where I actually needed to turn the volume DOWN a bit &#8230; but its worth mentioning the AAX4 sound is really just a joke. Like some side thing they happened to think about before completion like, &#34;oh shoot!! We should probably add some sound in this thing guys!!&#34;5. SIZE - The Roku IS a bit&#8230; bulkier. But still a small device so I'm good with it.6. ESTHETIC APPEAL - The AAX4 was clearly manufactured solely with projector functionality in mind. This clunky junk seriously reminds me of a 1987 PC (we've all seen the black screen with green letters). I really didn't think I'd give a damn about that &#8230; but as silly as I feel about caring about it, I DO care. It just reminds me of some cheap Chinese knock off.7. PRICE- I was FULLY expecting to pay $300.00 for a mini-projector. The Roku is 200 bucks people!! In fact you can check around and find it for less (RIGHT NOW on Groupon actually its $170.00).DO NOT TRUST ME&#8230; if you don't want. Just do your own research but for those of you who don't have the time, money and specificity that I have save yourself all of the aforementioned and buy the damn Roku, lol- and a nice AUX speaker- they got it right.", "So this is an interesting little toy, if a bit expensive for its size and audience. First off, the image quality is decent but not great; it's fine for movies but doesn't focus sharply enough for a computer display. You won't be doing impromptu PowerPoint shows with this. Sound quality is acceptable for movies for two, but for best results you really need either headphones orbig gaming speakersto get the proper effect. There's no surround sound, although presumably you could route your video source through a surround receiver and then use the HDMI-out from the receiver to feed the projector. Note that there is no analog in; you're limited to HDMI and MHL. (There is a second mystery port under where the Roku stick goes; it appears to be a USB port but it's not mentioned in the documentation.)The LED source is bright for its size, but really needs a very dark room for best results. If you don't mind a smaller image, it projects a better-quality image on the ceiling from desk height, but that's not really what you want most of the time; this definitely demands a large white wall or a queen-sized bedsheet at the very least. Also, the image size is impressive in a living room, but if you were planning to try to build a mini-IMAX in your garage, spend the two grand on an Epson 1080p projector, because this isn't up to the task. The ergonomics are decent enough; it sits flat on a table, and the end cap that covers the Roku slot is designed to allow you to aim it at the ceiling with no extra equipment. (The hinge is rather small, though, so if yours breaks off, don't lose it.) There's a tripod mount on the bottom and you can orient the image in whatever direction you want; however, there's no keystone control to compensate for skewed projection angles, so you have to pretty much aim the projector perpendicular to the viewing surface in order to get it to look right. The remote control is terrible; it's too small and too uniformly shaped, and it's very easy to pick up and use upside down. It also could have been made to fit inside the endcap for storage, but wasn't. The MHL port is also a bit awkwardly located; you may want to use a spudger to remove anything you plug into it, since it seems to want to be yanked out of the projector if you don't finesse it a little.TheRoku Streaming Stickis a subject for another review, but the interface is more or less identical to any Roku 2 box; it would be nice if it had a MicroSD slot for your own content, but I'm guessing it's already pretty tightly packed in there. The remote layout is completely different from a standard Roku and the game remote isn't included, so you're going to have to relearn all the button positions on that tiny craptastic remote. It also represents an interesting bit of futureproofing on 3M's part -- if Roku ever went out of business, you'd still be able to use the projector. (As long as the battery still held out, that is.)As a lot of other reviews have pointed out, in some ways this is a first-gen product. 3M is putting a big marketing push behind this projector, so I'm guessing there will be a second generation, so the key thing is to realize that you may need to keep your expectations a bit damped for this. However, if you don't go in expecting top performance, this will do the job just fine for movie nights with friends.", "This little projector  manages to deliver! It is tiny, I mean really tiny.  Person could carry this in a coat pocket if they wanted to.  Yet it projects a screen that is quite big. Takes up my whole wall if I let it, making the characters almost life size.The nice thing about it being small is you can place it almost anywhere and on anything and it isn't distracting. It also has the nice feature of having a place where a person could screw it into a tripod.The speakers on the unit are ok, but I find it is better for sound plugging it into some other speaker device, such as anMonitor Audio i-deck 200 iPod Dock (Black)deck. You can do this easily with an auxiliary cord.Once connected to your home wifi the viewing opportunities seem to be endless. Of course, you will pay for some channels if not all, but it will cost you quite a bit less than cable, and you get a wider selection.I have only projected on to a white wall during daylight hours, the darker you can make your room the better for viewing. Also a separate screen might improve the already great definition.", "\"This is NOT supposed to act as a full-size projector. Don't get it expecting it to be your main home theater display. However, for certain uses, this thing is amazing.DISPLAY:- the display on this thing seems to be HD. I know the description says 800 x 480, but I swear it's 720p. I hooked it up to my phone and had it playing videos and it really seemed very clear to me. I had the unit about 10' from my wall and the display was about 55-60\"\", similar to a normal home HDTV. It wasn't as bright as a real TV, but even with a lamp on, it was easily bright enough for watching shows / movies. If you're a gamer, I think you could use this for your display, but you'd want it to be closer/smaller... maybe 5' away, for something like a 36\"\" display, I'd think. This should be plenty bright/clear for higher-demand tasks like gaming, even with lights on. I haven't bothered with the battery-power display yet, since I have no qualms with just plugging this in.FORM/DESIGN:- this thing is COMPACT. Smaller than a portable CD player. The AC adapter lets you plug into a normal wall outlet, or one of those heavy-duty ones that your washing machine plugs into. It's as simple as plugging it in and hitting the 'Power' button. It has a built-in mount adapter that should let you use this with most camera / camcorder tripods and mounts, which will probably be the way you want to go if you're planning on using this a bunch. Audio is the one downside to this tiny unit. It's so faint as to be almost inaudible. Definitely plan on plugging this into a speaker. With my phone, I simply sync up to my portable Bluetooth speaker and my audio worries are done. For those curious, I use theTDK Life on Record A33 Wireless Weatherproof Speakerwhich is awesome... thePhilips ShoqBox SB7300 Bluetooth Portable Speaker Systemis a great, lighter-weight unit as well.FUNCTIONALITY:- I have Amazon Prime, so the Roku is cool that it lets me automatically stream that over WiFi. I don't have Netflix or anything else like that, so can't speak to those. Really, I don't plan on using this for the Roku... I took that out, and am using it instead as a display for my Galaxy SIII phone (or any other device with HDMI output). It's amazingly simple to use... simply plug in whatever device you want to display and power on the the projector. Done.USEFULNESS / VALUE:- this isn't what you'd use as your primary display, especially as a gamer. However, you COULD use it for that if you were happy with a 36\"\" or so display (the only way it'll be bright/clear enough for primary display use). However, I think it definitely has some significant value in certain applications, such as...- Camping- Kids' use (sleepover, wall projector in bedroom)- Showing pictures / videos on your phone- Watching shows/movies while traveling or saying in hostels- Gaming on the go (if you're stuck somewhere remote for work travel, for  instance).BOTTOM LINE:- I think this device is super useful. Honestly, I don't care too much about the Roku. But this tiny little projector? Awesome for travel, camping, or any time you want a portable display-on-demand for your phone or tablet.\"", "I hooked this up and within 10 minutes of opening the package, I was watching TV on my wall. This 3M projector is very small, but it displays a big picture on any large, flat surface (like a wall, screen, ceiling, etc.). Hook it into your Roku account and you can start streaming from major services like Amazon, Hulu or Netflix. The image quality is better than I expected, especially given how small the projector is. It's not high-def, but it's quite good for what it is. The sound quality is even decent. This device is as much of a novelty as anything else, but it's a fun piece of tech.", "..you only plan to use it where it is very dark.  Even for &#34;low light&#34; places this is just simply not bright enough.  If you are in a very dark place it is good for 720p.  It looks very good as far as quality of video in the DARK.  :)  The sound is even OK for a quiet area.  The focusing wheel is barely adequate.  You should be able to move in finer increments.  Unless you need the portability, there are normal projectors that do the job WAY better.  I returned it.  Just not worth the money IMO.", "There are so many reviews about how cool this thing is.So with that I'll just add my own 2 cents and say this is a fun little big screen T.V.on any wall at any time. All the apps and versatile use this gives makes it somethingdifferent from the rest, with Roku and HDMI hook up the uses out way any negatives.I put this on the wall in the family room and as long as the lighting is right I have no problemswatching a movie that's about 9 X 5 sure it might not be crystal clear but if its just a movie its ok.Now if its sports or something that has copy/text on top or bottom, you might get frustrated tryingto focus it in. For the sound I use an external speaker for the remote I use the Roku app on myKindle. The remote it comes with is ok you just have to kind of aim it up towards the ceiling and atthe device from a distance that isn't to far.If you want more clarity out of your picture just make it smaller!FYI: (Golf Looks Great On This!)That's all I have, I like this unit I think you might also.", "\"After putting this through some real world use and experimentation, my opinion is that this projector is going to be a fun toy for kids' sleepovers, maybe for some parties, etc  But mainly it's just that: a neat toy.  Please DO NOT expect to use this thing as your main HD A/V projector for ordinary use.  It really isn't fair (or possible) to compare this projector to those kinds of units, and here's why:1. The advertised resolution is only 854x480 (WVGA), but during boot-up and initial config the unit told me it was switching to 720p mode.  Theoretically, that'll get you DVD quality or basic HD, depending on which you believe.  HOWEVER, I've used it to watch several different kinds of media (animation, TV and film) and no matter what I throw at it, in practice the picture is very, very , very soft.  There is a manual focus wheel, but it doesn't achieve anything like the kind of sharpness you can achieve with a regular full sized projector, much less a plasma, LCD or CRT display.  Honestly, I'd say maximum visual sharpness is roughly on par with a good VHS tape player (i.e., maybe a 480i picture). My eyes have become so trained to expect tack-sharp LCD and plasma displays that it's really hard for me to enjoy watching this for very long. It brings back memories of watching broadcast TV on my parents' old Zenith tube TV.2. At only 60 lumens, the picture is pretty dim.  For comparison, most inexpensive consumer projectors emit 600-2000+ lumens.  To put it into even starker contrast, I own three Coast LED flashlights that put out 251, 339 and 615 lumens.  Yes, my smallest flashlight puts out 4x the light of this projector.  So imagine shining a rather dim flashlight on your wall: that'll give you a good idea how (not) bright this projector is.  In a dimly-lit room in the evening after sundown, the picture certainly is watchable, but you really want the room to be in darkness for best effect. Of course you can make it better with a specially reflective screen or white theater paint, but that may defeat the purpose of a portable projector.3. The combination of low brightness and a soft picture means you really shouldn't get your hopes up that this will drive a big 120\"\" screen like the advertising copy claims.  Over around 45-50\"\", the picture starts to get kind of washed-out, and of course the bigger it gets the more you notice its unsharpness.4. On the good side, it is easy to use and ridiculously small - I have coffee cups larger than this projector. That makes it very portable, very flexible, and easy to store when not in use.  It was easy to set up (less than 5 minutes), attach to my WPA2 WiFi network, make a Roku account and start using Netflix and Amazon Instant Video.  My kids were operating it five minutes after that.5. Also on the good side, It does have a single MHL video input, which (although the ad copy is silent about this) is a standard HDMI port.  That's a positive benefit, because it means the projector is NOT a one-trick pony.  You can use it with your cable box, TiVo, DVD player, blu ray player, game console, computer, camcorder, camera, tablet, etc.  That's awesome.So what is this thing good for?  In two words: uncritical viewing.  Kids' use, sleepovers, outdoor projection at night onto a garage, holiday effects projected onto your house, etc.  If that's what you're looking for, then this projector delivers a lot of fun, value and convenience.  Still, I wonder if that's enough to justify the retail price for most people, most of the time.  Caveat emptor, you might like this a lot if you have reasonable expectations, otherwise, stick to your regular TV for group watching, or use your tablet or phone for portable viewing.\"", "\"Pros:PortableCons:Need large unobscured white wallVery little actual free contentInternal speaker is pitifulRequires a dark roomThe image quality is \"\"okay\"\", nothing like using a real HDTV.  The maximum resolution is 720p (according to the setup menu) which may or may not look good depending on how large you make the projection and how good the surface is which you are projecting onto.  There is a fairly severe trapezoid distortion issue which can't be adjusted.Portability is excellent, especially considering it can run for a couple hours on battery power.Working the menus and bringing up content is a bit slow (but not unexpected considering the network communication going on).  Keep in mind this requires you to have a wireless access point to provide Internet access.To sign up and activate your device you *must* provide a credit card (they promise not to bill you unless you buy anything) and a credit card *must* remain on file with them.\"\"Membership may be required for some content.\"\" is an understatement.  Almost all content requires paying for it either \"\"on demand\"\" or via subscription.  That might be okay for Roku connected directly to a HDTV but for a low quality projection there is no way I would pay for content.I have a large house and I was surprised to realize that I don't have a wall upon which I could project this!\"", "This is fun.  :)It's basically a small projector that will fit in your hand.  It has a ROKU stick that fits in it.  It CAN be used with other devices but I can't think of any to use with it; primarily it is meant to stream Roku content.Set up was easy.  Instructions were very brief and easy to follow.  You plug it in and it works.  If you want to, you can let it charge, then it's good for about 2 hours and 45 minutes,which is more than enough for a movie outside or someplace you don't have access to a plug in.If you can find a hotspot, you can watch a movie.Set up goes just like a Roku - the first time you turn it on, it updates, and then you can sign into your Roku account or make a new one.  I've been using Roku for years and own 2, so I was actually a bit nervous that this little USB-like stick would have enough memory for all my channels.  I have 62 channels, including all the big ones - Amazon, Hulu Plus, Roku, HBOgo- but it held them all no problem!What I do NOT like is the little remote.  It's small, thin, and the buttons are too close together.  I kept wanting to point it at the wall and NOT at the Roku.  ha!  But the navigation and function buttons are too close and it contributed to me accidentally messing up my network passcode several times.  I gave up and got my smartphone out with it's roku remote app.  MUCH better.  That's a free app and it's a lot better than this remote.The projection is clear, and very easy to focus, although I wish that focus button was just a BIT tighter on the turn.One thing to consider is sound.  This is NOT very loud - if you plan to use it outside, you will want to do SOMETHING to augment this sound- it is NOT loud enough to compete with the bugs in the South.  It has a standard headphone type/input jack.  Instead of lugging my stereo around, I'll probably just get some decent computer speakers and run a drop cord.  If you watch a movie in the bed, projected to the ceiling or something, you might want a headphone splitter, although I find it is loud enough for this use - but the sound quality is clear, but certainly not ANY bragging point.This would make a great gift for anyone that might have to be on extended bedrest.  I was on bedrest for 6 weeks and I would have LOVED one of these during that time.  It's also going to be great for Halloween.  I have a green house and was projecting the Matrix screensaver on it.  Too cool!  I can see it will be great for holiday fun!", "I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn't work out.First of all, you need to have a really good, smooth, white surface (preferably a dedicated movie screen) to achieve the optimum results.  A very, very dark room would also help.  Yes, of course you could use the wall, a bed sheet or some other improvised backdrop, but it would defeat the whole point of seeing a film in the manner this projector was designed for.Also, you must put up a credit card in order to use any of the channels available to you.  Even if you are only accessing the free channels.  And between you and me, I'm not that excited watching the NASA channel nonstop.  You could use your Prime membership to watch movies, but that wasn't so great either.Other reviewers have suggested it would be terrific for a slumber party.  Really?  What's the matter with your big screen T.V.?  The picture quality is excellent but the sound is not up to par.  If you're gonna go this far then you really need to be firing on all cylinders with the sound and the picture.In conclusion, this is really a disappointment. I had hoped I could watch baseball or something else of interest to me, but this projector requires too many variables to line up perfectly, and it's just not worth the time or the effort.The one positive - it's really cute and small.", "got this for christmas for my daughter and she's watched netflix all day on her vacation. being a led lit pj there's really no worry about killing the bulb (unless just plain defective). at 20,000 hrs she'll have tossed out already.it's not very bright, but bright enough to use with the lights on. we display a 72&#34; image on a large piece of foam core for her. i wouldn't call it a great quality image, but good enough for an 8 year old. so far it's worth the money at it's lowered price. i'd never would have gotten it at the price it was originally released.", "I have been using this projector for awhile. I have use it in the backyard and on trips as well to the park with our Camper . I brought a portable screen so we can take this anywhere.  I have to say when it is completely dark you have a bright picture, but when its not two dark the picture comes in light. I like that it has the Roku player with it , it gives me more options when I am on my trip. My family loves watching movies so this will make any movie watcher very happy.", "\"The 3M Streaming Projector Powered by Roku is quite literally plug-and-play, as long as a wireless internet connection is available.I would like to separate this review into two parts: Roku and the Streaming Projector. The combination is cool, but the true value is understood independently.I have had theRoku HD Streaming Playerfor about a year, and have been quite pleased. With Roku, various streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, HULU, Pandora, and many more are provided instantly and seamlessly on an easy to use interface. The Streaming Projector adds another medium through which Roku's service can be enjoyed.With this product package Roku is not simply built into the projector, but delivered through the included, and removable, Roku Stick. Roku has essentially reduced the size of their set top box down to the size of a large thumb drive with a male HDMI connector. The Stick is plugged into the projector to deliver Roku's service. What I didn't realize prior to receiving the product was that the Stick can also be plugged directly into one's TV or computer, making Roku much more mobile.As for the projector itself, this thing is a lot of product in a little package. The image is crisp, clear, and clean - provided that the picture settings and focus wheel have been properly adjusted. It comes with a handy remote, and power adapter. What's more, the projector is actually mobile and will hold a charge... just in case one ends up in the wilderness.The product description claims it has the ability to project up to 120\"\", and this is definitely accurate. Amazingly, it can produce an image of this size without having to be placed 1,000 feet away from the intended surface. I would say it is more like 12 feet or so.Similar to my confusion with regard to the Roku aspect of this product, I did not realize that the Streaming Projector could be utilized independent of Roku. With its HDMI input, the Streaming Projector can satisfy so many display needs. My first trial connection beyond the Roku Stick was the PS3. The Roku is neat, but being able to game on a 100\"\" screen is really, really neat. I have also tried out the Streaming Projector with my laptop, and believe it will come in quite handy for work presentations.Over all, I will definitely recommend the 3M Streaming Projector Powered by Roku to as many people as I can. Between the multiple applications of both the Roku Stick and the Streaming Projector, I believe this product package is worth more than the sum of its parts.I would recommend purchasing anAmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard], as the package does not come with one. I would also recommend picking up a tripod for the projector, I believe the3M PT05B Tripod for 120/150/160/180/220/225a/CP40/CP45 Mobile Projectors  (Black/Silver)works, but I have not actually received the tripod yet, so I don't know for sure that it is compatible. A good set of external speakers would also be a sound investment. The onboard sound is impressive for what it is, but could be improved with a decent set of computer speakers.\"", "\"UPDATE, Sep. 19, 2013: Nearly a year after this review, the iPad streaming still works, but has become a bit glitchy.  I'm chalking it up to iOS 7 (I'm now getting warnings that the Apple HDMI adapter is not compatible).  See the comments thread for some information about how I still manage to get iPad streaming to work with this projector.  It's not as simple as it once was, but it still works.UPDATE: Thanks to commenters for clarifying...this ACCEPTS 720p input.  This does not PROJECT in 720p.  Take the time to read the comments attached to this review.Before I got this, I read a lot of forums where people speculated about the quality to expect.  They said things like \"\"don't expect better than 480p resolution\"\" and \"\"at best, this will only work in a very dark room\"\".  Well I am happy to say that \"\"they\"\" were wrong.  This is not an awesome projector, but it is awesome FOR THE PRICE.There are 4 reasons for me to recommend this:1) It's bright enough to use during the day.  Right now, it's 4:30pm, on an overcast day, and daylight is entering my two south-facing living room windows.  With the projector 9 feet from a wall directly opposite the windows (giving me an image that is roughly 6 feet across), the image is acceptable.  Pull the curtains, and the image is better.  Wait until night time?  Better still.  The point is, although this is not a high-powered projector (it couldn't possibly be, for the price), it's quite acceptable.  Are the kids having a sleepover?  This would be a great way to entertain them.2) The Roku Streaming Stick setup was as smooth as could be.  In fact, I did all the setup without even opening the manual.  Since I already have a Roku box, setting this up was even easier.  Once I logged in with my Roku account, the setup included putting all the same channels on the stick that were already on the box.  I also have the iPhone app that lets me control my Roku box.  I tried the app with the Roku stick, and it worked flawlessly.  Really, this could not have been an easier process.  (Side note: Even though it put the Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu channels on there for me, I still need to go through the one-time \"\"linking\"\" of each account with the stick.)3) The output is 720p.  At first, I doubted this...the projector started up in 480p mode.  But as soon as I connected the streaming stick, it automatically switched to the higher-resolution 720p mode. [UPDATE...this accepts inputs up to 720p...but output is NOT 720p.  Be sure to read the comment thread after this review.]4) It works with my iPad!  This was a pleasant surprise.  Knowing nothing about the Roku streaming stick, I had expected that the stick had a USB interface.  I was wrong.  It has an HDMI interface.  So, I wondered, since I have an HDMI connector for my iPad: Could I connect the iPad to the projector?  The answer: YES!  I was able to mirror my iPad on the 3M projector.  In fact, I tried the Netflix iPad app, and it worked perfectly (including pushing the audio through to the projector).My ONLY complaint is that the sound from the projector is too quiet.  For something that is supposed to be able to project a large image, one might expect that the sound would be comparable.  It is not.  In fact, the projector has a cooling fan that runs all the time, and I can actually hear the fan over the audio.  Fortunately, there is a 3.5mm jack that can be used for external speakers or for headphones.Don't expect to be blown away, and you won't be disappointed.  This is a handy little projector, with better than expected versatility and image quality.  Definitely good for the price!\"", "My first projector (Advent) cost me about $4000 in 1980 and weighted 250 pounds for the projector. The screen was separate.  To keep the unit running, I had to install my own fan and I was always removing components on the circuit board and replacing them. The brightness was 20 Lumens.  There were three projector guns. Each of these cost over $300.00 and needed to be replaced every few hundred hours. There as a time when I played with kits that would convert 12 inch Sony TVs into very bad projectors. These kits required you to invert the image and to pop rivet a Fresnel lens to the front of the TV.  The projector brought me several years of enjoyment.  I replaced it with a Kloss projector.  This projector cost about $3000.00.  I could display a 100 inch image.  The image was better. The unit was more stable and required less repairs.  I replaced that unit with a Ampro project that cost about $8000.00.  It was a 100 inch unit. I think it was about 25 lumens.  My last projector was an NEC that cost me $8000.00. It was a LCD unit with 640 x 480.  It had 400 lumens.I now have 65 inch Plasma screens for my primary viewing.  I was going to take a trip with the family and thought the 3M Roku projector would be great to entertain the kids.  I thought that at night in the hotel, I could set them up with WIFI to play their cartoons from Netflix while I watched the news on the hotel TV.  I figured with the lights out and the projector close enough to the wall, we would get an acceptable picture.When I got the unit, I put in the Roku stick.  I turned the unit on and was surprised to see the purple Roku letter bouncing on the wall with all the lights on.I spent quite a while setting up the Roku information and logging into my accounts.  I then turned out the lights and started playing some stuff on HBOGo and Netflix.The video was actually watchable.  The brightness was reasonable.  For less than a 32 inch LCD 720P, I now had a projector and a Roku box that could fit into a suitcase.Text is very readable on the screen.  Colors were much better than I expected.  The image wasn't slanted towards blue or yellow.This is a great product for the price.  It is great for travel.  It is great for keeping the kids in a room where there is no TV.  The projector doesn't replace LED, LCD or Plasma screens but it is a great extension.  I know a couple who are renting a basement and are using an old NTSC TV to watch shows.  For $220.00, the 3M projector would give them a much better viewing experience.Negatives --  As others have mentioned, the sound doesn't get loud.  The sound is only as loud as one would expect from a tablet or laptop.The focusing is a bit tricky.  There isn't much granularity in the focusing.  The lens is probably not as crisp as it could be but the image can be focused well enough to read text very easily.This is a great product at a great price.  It won't replace your existing HD TVs but it can provide a lot of fun.", "I ended up being VERY impressed by this unit and find it to be a rather fun toy! The batteries last long enough to stream a full movie, which you can do from Amazon VOD, Netflix or Hulu+ via Roku's apps (so long as you're within WiFi range) and it has a full-sized HDMI port if you want to hook up a different device (Blu-ray player, Apple TV, iPad with video-out cable).It's fall break right now, and I'm looking forward to sitting in the back yard with the kids projecting a movie in a tent or our house!Word of warning, however: the built-in speaker is only about as loud as a cellular speakerphone, so you may want some external speakers if you want to get serious about audio with this unit.", "\"This is really two products, the little 3M projector, and the Roku Streaming Stick.The 3M projector is a fun little gizmo that projects standard definition images, 480P, on any convenient wall or ceiling.  This is as simple a projector as is possible to make.  There's only one input, the HDMI//MHL port; only one knob, the focus wheel; and just a few buttons: power, volume up & down, menu and info.  This simplicity makes it both easier and more difficult to set-up.  There's no elevating front foot or keystone correction.Most video projectors--even very cheap ones--have a screw adjustable front foot so the picture can be projected higher onto the wall.  Doing so results in a picture that, instead of a rectangle, is a trapezoid that's wider on top than bottom.  So, there's usually a keystone correction control that returns the picture to square.  Since this projector doesn't have that, it must be positioned exactly perpendicular to the surface on which it's projecting.  That limits you quite a lot when it comes to placement.The projector is preset to shoot upwards so that the bottom of the image is slightly higher than the surface the projector is sitting on.  That's good.  Also good is the flat surface on the back that allows you to stand the projector on its backside and project onto the ceiling.  Unfortunately, since it's preset to shoot at an upward angle, if you put this little guy on your nightstand pointed at the ceiling, most of the picture will end up smeared on the wall behind your headboard.  Sorry to keep harping on this, but this projector really would be a lot more fun to use if you weren't constantly trying to find a position that works.Video and audio quality are just OK.  Video quality is adequate but not stellar.  The built-in speaker can produce about as much volume as an iPhone.  This little guy isn't meant to be a replacement for your home theater.  It's meant to be fun, and it is.Among internet TV services, Roku is the 800 pound gorilla in the room.  Roku says they've got 600+ channels to offer.  To use Roku service you first have to sign up with a credit card.  Once Roku has your credit card info, address and phone number, they'll allow you to activate the streaming stick.  Some of the channels are free and ad-supported, like Crackle and most of the news channels.  Most of the movie and TV channels are pay-per-view, like Amazon and Vudu.  There's also monthly-fee subscription services, like Hulu+ and Netflix.  Aside from that, there are games and screen savers you can buy.The Roku Streaming Stick is the standard Roku box reduced down to a dongle that plugs into the back of the 3M projector.  But unlike the projector which can work with any HDMI or MHL input,  the Roku Streaming Stick can only work with this projector and two TVs made by Insignia as I write this.  The Roku streaming stick is a brand new product (I'm writing this in Oct. 2012), and may very well work with a lot of products in the days ahead.Once the Streaming Stick is set up and connected with your wi-fi and once the battery is charged, this becomes a very cool gizmo.  You can stream video anywhere within range of your wi-fi without so much as a power cord to worry about.  I'm planning on projecting a scary movie onto the side of the house Halloween night.Battery life is about 1 hour 45 minutes at standard brightness and 2 hours 50 minutes on \"\"Eco\"\" mode.  3M's instructions are scant and error ridden, but the projector is easy to figure out.  The remote is a miniature that's a chore to use, but works well and aim doesn't seem to be critical.  That's good when you have a lifetime habit of aiming the remote at the screen.Overall the 3M projector and Roku Streaming Stick are a fun combo and a little frustrating too.  It's ultra portable, but you can't take it on a camping trip (no wi-fi).  The Roku stick can steam high-def 1080p images, but the projector can only display standard definition 480p.  You can project onto any wall, but you've got to find a leveled surface at just the right height for the projector to sit on.  I think the projector by itself would be a good companion to an iPhone or iPad with an adapter cable.  Together with the Roku stick the 3M projector's a neat toy, but just a toy.\"", "I got this for those impromptu business meetings that we need a projector for.  In a darkened office it works great.  Nice that it has a battery so I don't have to look for an outlet.  Only issue is removing the Roku stick.  It is stuck in there very tightly.  Now I just leave it out.", "This is a much better picture than I would have ever guessed.  I bought it with the little adjustable tripod (A MUST) and use it on the wall.  It is great when dim to dark in the room.  The ROKU stick is a big bonus.  The HDMI input works with computer and phone.  Highly recommended for kids, or a budget room projector.  Has focus but no other picture adjustment.  Pretty much Wall only.  But in a big room it throws a great picture.  I am completely amazed.  Would pay full price for it though.  They are on sale all over the net due to its limitations.", "I was a bit skeptical about this little critter, given its price and lumen output, but I was Pleasantly Surprised when I booted the Roku unit and projected StarTrek Voyager onto my garage door with better than 16mm film output for sure at that giant size. The image was amazingly bright, although we did do this at night.When used indoors this projector has a Very Nice image quality when viewed on an appropriate screen, and a Quite Acceptable image quality when projected on a plain, white wall.For the price, and the fact that you get a Roku unit along with it, I Can Recommend this projector as a useful, very portable critter.", "\"The novelty of this item is what drew me to want i: the projector is small and portable; all you really need is wifi and you're good to go. Our Wii just died so we've not been able to access Netflix on our TV and my kids have been missing watching some of their favorite programs. We've only one TV in the house so I can already tell that this projector is going to be widely used! Truly, as long as you have a wall and wifi access, you can watch a movie anywhere.Since I've never had a Roku or streaming device, set up wasn't as intuitive for me as it was others, but even so, I didn't have a bad time figuring out how to set it up. It really does walk you through it, once you get it signed onto your wifi account.To access my Netflix, Amazon Instant video (prime) and all that, you have to sign into them. While simple, the included remote isn't the easiest thing to navigate and took a bit of time. After the initial set up, this thing is great. Even though my kids could easily watch a recorded Mythbusters on our TV, they're on the floor watching it against a wall. It's an overcast day  and the screen is quite bright enough. The sound is adequate too, especially since they're only a few feet away from the projector.It really is a fun item, but is it worth 300? If you'll use it for its portability and ease in watching a movie anywhere, then yes it is worth it. If you are a TV/video person that is a stickler for HDMI or other high quality viewing and sound then you might want to skip this. For what it is, it's fun and works flawlessly with minimal troubleshooting, if any. My kids can't wait to have a real \"\"movie night\"\" when it gets a bit darker.All in all, a nice little portable wireless projector that your kids will love and you'll probably use it often just because you have it and the set up is so easy.\"", "This is a nice projector.This will not defy the laws of physics and be a bright as big projectors.It's perfectly fine in a dark room, but as expected the further you are from the projected wall, the dimmer it gets.The roku stick is HDMI interface (I thought it was USB at first and that there are no inputs). Once the roku stick is removed, the HDMI input works perfectly.The audio volume can't get very high, but there are headphone jacks.One thing that annoyed me about the roku stick is that it won't remember more than 1 wifi network at a time. I think this is a drawback for something that is so portable.If you have a need for something like this, it's great.", "\"Here are my thoughts about Roku. Generally I like the product, but in setting it up I had some concerns.PROS:**Easy to set up**Compact - it's so small it fits in one hand.**Picture quality is pretty sharp depending upon the source. It is not HD quality but more like a decent DVD (though not Blu-Ray).**A number of free channels available through Roku. You can add a lot of content. Since I'm an old movie buff, I added Pub a Hub (public domain movies) and Crackle (pretty bad recent movies but some good classics, like Easy Rider).**Picture is big. I have a friend who has a projector that's five times as big as the Roku, and yet the projected image is the same size. That's impressive.CONS:**How much radiation does this device emit? In the fine print, the instruction booklet reads: \"\"This equipment complies with FCC radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment. This equipment should be installed and operated with minimum distance 20CM between the RADIATOR AND YOUR BODY.\"\"Hmm. I don't know about you, but it's hard not to sit pretty close to the projector. I used it in the bedroom and watched a movie on the ceiling. Of course I had to be close to it in order to put it at the right angle. How much radiation is the device emitting?**Roku asks for your credit card information before you can use the device. When you set up an account, even if you don't want anything other than the free channels, they force you to put your credit card on file. The other privacy issue I object to is the way Roku allows you to connect to Facebook. In order for Roku to work, you were pretty much forced to allow Roku to access your information on Facebook at any time (even when you're logged out!) Not happy about this.**In order to add some channels to the Roku network, you have to establish separate accounts. That means establishing one for Netflix, one for Amazon, etc, if you don't already have one. This means I'm sharing my account information with a number of companies I may or may not want to do business with. No doubt all this information will be shared among the video providers. That means a lot of spam will be coming my way in my email.**Roku is geared toward convincing you to subscribe to as many streaming (pay on demand) services as possible. I'm not sure I would pay $300 for it, as it is very much a device aimed to getting you to subscribe to streaming channels. You can use it other ways, but Roku feels like a product sponsored by many vendors, as opposed to a stand-alone projector.My conclusion? I recommend it with some reservations as noted above.\"", "\"Summary: extraordinary projector for the size, definitely worth a look if you were considering a Roku devce for your home.This review will be in two sections - one on the projector and one on the Roku stick, noting that you are an ideal customer for this if:1) A super small and portable projector sounds like a great toy for slumber parties for the kids, camping out, or whatever.2) You've been considering a Roku device to stream your Netflix, Vudu, etc.If BOTH 1 and 2 above do not apply to you, you may want to rethink whether this product is what you want.PROJECTOR: 4 STARSAs far as the size of the projector, this actually will fit in a coat pocket, though it's not going to be comfortable.  You will definitely need some type of tripod to aim and adjust the picture since there aren't any keystone or other adjustment optics.  There are any number of excellent micro tripods, I'm using a plastic fold-up from my point and shoot days.  Consider that the battery is built in and you've got something you can easily take anywhere.The image quality is very good *Considering* the price and size.  The lens has a anti reflection coating on it but only focuses so well.  That's just as well since the resolution, at 854 x 480 wasnt going to be razor sharp anyways.  The Roku Stick indicates 720p but since that's 1280x720 and higher than the resolution of the projector, there is clearly some downscaling.  HD quality?  No, but overall, I found the image quality to be comparable to a DVD - very watchable but not as crisp as I am used to on our HDTV.How big a picture can you get with 60 lumens and 854x480?  From 100 inches (8' 4\"\") away the projector gave a fairly bright 70 inch diagonal picture - enough that a light on the other side of the room wasn't an issue.  From 15 feet away there was an 120 inch diagonal picture, but this was really only acceptable with all the lights out.  This was to a standard flat white wall in our basement.  By the way, it was quite hard to find a blank wall that big - 120 inches is HUGE!!!One surprise - although video adjustments like skew and keystone aren't included in the projector, you can flip and reverse the image -  This would also allow you to hang this upside down or project on a rear projection screen -  I'm now planning something interesting for Halloween...Looking through the other pico projector offerings, nothing else currently offers this resolution and brightness (60 lumens) at this price and size - I'm considering the price of the Roku stick as basically 1/3 and the price of the projector as 2/3In a quiet room the volume of the built in speakers is *just* adequate - you'll want to hook into something more powerful. Too bad this didn't come with bluetooth - that would have been fantastic to link to a Jambox or other device.  There is a cooling fan that you can hear, but it's very faint and far from objectionable.I tried this on battery only and got nowhere near the 2-1/2 hours they claim.  I watched about an hour worth of stuff and the battery showed up with one bar left.  I will have to test it out with a timer, but I'm thinking they must be using it at a lower brightness setting.  CNET tested and found they got between 95 and 110 minutes max from the battery.  *Just* enough for the average movie.  All righty then!  *Update*  I watched stuff for a solid 1:40 yesterday before the light started blinking red, so this agrees with CNET's testing.Finally, the projector video signal input is MHL which is basically a standard size HDMI with power.  I plugged it into my laptop and instantly had both sound and vision - would certainly work as pico projector for presentations - again the internal battery would be a huge plus.  I'm going to get the MHL adapter for my cell phone - most new high end cell phones can do an HDMI output so I can actually stream from my phone (HTC EVO LTE, same as the HTC One)ROKU STICK: 3-1/2 STARSIt just came out.  It's incredible how small it is compared to the earlier Roku boxes, but there's one *BIG* down side.  It requires a MHL HDMI slot which means that it will fit - but won't work - on your standard HDMI port.  Some of the newer TV's are \"\"Roku Ready\"\" but it didn't work on my older Panasonic plasma.  That's the biggest reason for dinging it a full star.  I'd also propose that you compare Roku closely with Boxee - I personally would prefer Boxee since I have a large library of content for the kids in Divx.  Roku does not have DLNA access (playing networked content) there is a workaround - more on that later.If you already have a subscription with Amazon, Vudu, or Netflix, I don't have to explain what you can watch.  Lots of other fee based channels.  However, one nice bit is that there's a LOT of free sites - movies on demand with interspersed commercials.  Right now I'm watching \"\"La Femme Nikita\"\" (The original French version with subtitles)  on Crackle.  Bud light commercials every ~10 minutes.There's a great APP on my Android phone that allows me to use my phone as a remote and manage my channels.  Much better interface than the little remote with bubble clicky buttons. Otherwise the small remote that was provided works well enough for the Roku stick and projector.ADC is another great free channel - you can opt to see the videos for free or pay a buck (for most) to watch commercial free.  Popflix, Moonlight Movies, Retrovision and others offer lots of older movies and television shows.One key channel to load is PLEX.  This allows you to watch movies or listen to music you already have on your computer - as long as it is connected to your network.  You have to load a program on your computer and then have it run on your machine.  I'm a little mixed on this functionality speed, privacy and other compatibility seems less than optimal, but still better than nothing for now.  It also search through the other channels for content.One annoyance is that it takes a long time to boot up - consistently 80-90 seconds.  Also before i used it for the first time it had to update the Roku device - 43 minutes!!! (this was on a N wifi connection)  A convenient workaround, assuming it's plugged in, is to turn of the projector (with the lightbulb icon on the remote) when you're not using it rather than shutting it down.Will anyone come out with an adapter that will allow this to be used with older TVs?  If one was available, I'd probably bump the stick up to 4 stars.If you have any questions, comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03704983741044998, 0.001155235106125474, 0.006688481662422419, 0.14320924878120422, 0.0004726171027868986, 0.002039168495684862, 0.00025081506464630365, 0.057834845036268234, 0.0018390765180811286, 0.016916219145059586, 0.002495517022907734, 0.11255257576704025, 0.0008191941305994987, 0.14101770520210266, 0.007946348749101162, 0.0008793305605649948, 0.0009743982809595764, 0.04259159788489342, 0.0002447499136906117, 0.06288605183362961, 8.109158807201311e-05, 0.0019982443191111088, 0.0020093172788619995, 0.12291287630796432, 0.017114993184804916, 0.04628681391477585, 0.00016969926946330816, 0.10986291617155075, 0.05962791666388512, 7.313784590223804e-05]]}
