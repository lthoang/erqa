I am very pleased with its performance.  The picture and sound of the receiving TV set are as good as those of my 32\"\" Sony CRT TV set connected to the VCR by wire. I was pleasantly surprised.  Set up is easy: With the On-Off switches at OFF, connect the three RCA connectors of the transmitter to the corresponding ones at the source, e.g. a VCR, employing one of the two RCA cables included.  Connect the receiver to the receiving TV set in the same manner.  My TV set does not come with RCA connectors.  I use an RF modulator to make the connection (See Note 1). Orient the dishes of the transmitter and the receiver so that they face each other.  Verify that the DIP-switches at the back of the transmitter and the receiver are set in the same way.  Plug in the power.  Two 100-240V 50/60 Hz transformers are included.  A red LED indicator in the front red window lights up when the power is switched on.  There are six channels.  Use the channel selection button at the side of the receiver to toggle them for the best picture.  There is a built-in IR remote extender in the transmitter.  To set it up, insert the 2.5mm plug of the IR emitter into the jack at the side of the transmitter, peel off the piece of white plastic at the bottom of the emitter and stick it on the IR window of the source, in my case, the VCR. Now, I can control my VCR from another room by simply pointing my IR remote control at the red window of the receiver where an IR sensor is located.  This IR remote extender works well.Note 1:Dynex WS-007 - RF modulator\"", "I was quite skeptical when I bought the wireless transmitter and receiver to have my Directv in another room of the house. I had tried a different brand and model from a local store and was very disappointed with the video & sound quality.  I am happy to say this expereince was just the opposite.  This was easy to attack to the back of my Directv receiver and set up in the second room and the quality of the video and sound (while not HD) is amazing.  No interference and easy tv watching.  I had the unit for over a month now and still feel the same way.", "I love this unit. It enables me to have my kitchen TV on my counter without a huge ugly DIRECTV or cable box on the counter (AND eliminates the need to pay for an extra room, too). The only complaint I have is that physical obstacles placed in between the two units cause annoying loud static and picture distortion. This happens when, for example, we open the cellar door, temporarily blocking the signal. If you have a clear line of sight between your two units (which is impossible in our situation), you should have no issues and be very satisfied with the picture quality and sound!", "I have had these for about 4 years now and about 2 years after I bought them the transmitter just stopped working.  I contacted the manufacturer and even though it was outside the normal warranty they replaced it free of charge and just ask that I send back the bad one so they could figure out what went wrong so they could make sure future transmitters didn't have a similar problem.Back to the review..PRO:  I can feed tv shows (Hulu and [...] for example) to my tv from my PC.  As long as you have a video card and the necessary adapters to push video with RCA jacks you are good to go.  These are primarily designed so you can have one SAT tv box (for example) and feed the signal to another tv.  When I first got this thats what I did with it.  I had just one SAT tv box in the living room.  When I wanted to go to bed, I just took the remote with me and and I could watch tv and change channels on the SAT box because of the IR mouse capability.CON:  The signal is only analog.  When turning on my transmitter the channel it uses (1-4) to send the signal bumps up by one.  I keep it set on ch1 but when I turn it on it bumps to ch2.  The transmitter and receiver get hot if you just leave them on all the time, I would recommend turning them off when not in use to aid in extending their lifespan.Overall these have greatly added to the tv enjoyment of our family.  If you have a similar need then I recommend these.", "\"I bought the device to send sound to my patio. Previously, I had a 2.4 ghz unit that was reallly not viable in my home. The 5.8 delivers sound perfectly and has no interference whatsoever. I have not tried the video nor the IR since my 65\"\" TV is clearly visible from the patio and the remote for my system works throught the window as well.\"", "One receiver is in my shop through five walls, one being plywood. It feeds a 19&#34; LED TV and computer sound system with a subwoofer. The picture is perfect with careful positioning of the receiver. The other receiver feeds an old CRT TV, four rooms from the transmitter. It works perfectly, but again, the receiver must be carefully positioned to avoid static.I don't leave the transmitter and receivers on 24/7, which I did with a cheaper system that failed after four months.It's been four months now, and it's still going strong.", "I needed to upgrade from an older 2.4 GHZ X10-brand wireless sender/receiver because I was using the receiver in a kitchen and the microwave broke up the signal every time it ran.The 5 GHZ Nyrius did exactly what I hoped it would - the microwave in the room doesn't bother it at all, and the picture is very clean and nice.Things I learned:- The Nyrius doesn't have quite the range of the X10.  I'm sending a signal through two wood-framed walls and it took a lot of setup time and fiddling to get a clean signal at the receiving end. The X10 was much more forgiving in terms of antenna aiming and intervening obstacles.- The Nyrius transmitter can be very sensitive to electronics in its vicinity.  Mine is sitting behind a 55-inch flat screen, and although the signal does not travel through it but sideways along its back, I could not get a good signal at the receiving end.  When I moved the transmitter all the way to the closest end of the TV so it was not transmitting past the flat-screen, the signal cleared up.  however, this was farther than the IR emitter's cable would reach, so i'm without remote control until I find a suitable extension cable.- The reset button on the receiver is very handy.  We have occasional pulses of RF interference from an unknown source, but pressing the reset button always results in removing the pulses of interference.This is a good unit, but it has limits on how many walls it will transit and how much electronic equipment can be immediately adjacent to the transmitter.  Play with placement carefully and be patient.  The results should be excellent.", "But it's not the bestest. Pretty cheesy but it will send a single across the room. Used it on a steadicam with a 9volt adapter. Worked ok. Did what it was supposed to do, but the transmitter is just too huge!", "5 STARS , SHIPPED VIA AMAZONEXCELLENT AUDIO,VIDEO.POWERCABLE WAS FRAIL,BUT PLAYED WITH IT 15 MINUTES,THEN IT POWERED
