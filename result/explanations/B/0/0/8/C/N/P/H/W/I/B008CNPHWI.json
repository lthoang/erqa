I was not expecting a toy that actually crawl slowly and encourage our baby to crawl with it. While playing the music if your baby catches the toy it will stop and congratulate the baby. Well worth the money, and a fun addition to our nursery that our baby loves.", "I picked this up for my 3 month old nephew because I thought it looked SO cute. And cute it is. And who doesn't like turtles. I will admit that he's not quite crawling yet, but that didn't mean that us adults couldn't play with it - and play with it we did. Such a sweet little toy and we cannot wait for him to try to go after it. My kids are all older and even they said it would be a hit.I can see how it might get annoying after a while, but I didn't find it to be overly loud so I doubt it would be banished to the garage right away.If you have a little one that is just learning to crawl, you simply cannot go wrong with this. It's amazingly adorable and I really kind of wanted to take it back home with me.Recommended for the crawlers out there.", "This little turtle is so cute. The speaking part is quite annoying though. I wish it at least had more phrases to say to add some variety. It only has about 4 or 5 phrases and got to be quite annoying very quickly. The turtle crawls extremely slowly, so even the slowest baby should have no trouble catching up to it. It crawled fine on the tile floor and the family room's berber carpet, but did not crawl at all on the carpet of the other rooms (which have a higher pile).  The legs were moving but it was going nowhere.", "\"Gund is a quality toy maker.  I have always loved their stuffed animals.  The Crawl with Me Turtle is no exception to the quality and stylized adorable design of Gund.The soft outer animal houses a battery operated crawling and talking mechanism.  The hard plastic is durable for repeated use, but the cuddly turtle exterior is a soft padding to prevent injury with regular use.  The easy on/off function allows for parents to control the device with ease.  And the baby needs only to touch the turtle to propel it to crawl or stop it once caught.  The voice is very young and sweet sounding.  Encouraging your child along are phrases like \"\"Crawl with me baby,\"\" \"\"catch me baby,\"\" or \"\"you got me baby.\"\"  Very encouraging for baby, but after a while, I got a little annoyed.It is exactly as described.  And it is a rather adorable room decoration until or after baby can use it.  I would recommend Crawl with Me Turtle to babies who are starting to become mobile.* One note, the turtle looks like a tan/beige/light brown color in pictures, but it is a pretty pale green color.\"", "The Gund Crawl with Me Turtle is a cute little toy but it's a bit limited. I have to confess that my daughter is several months past crawling so this toy isn't much use to her and I wasn't able to use it as a legitimate test to see if it can encourage a child to crawl. What I can say is that I was surprised at how slow it moves. Even for a turtle it is SLOW. It walks maybe its own body length of around 11 inches while giving encouragement to the child and then stops. If the child reaches out and touches its shell it will move again reciting the same message again ad nauseum. The toy is really only useful for the few months where a child is just starting to learn to crawl. Even while crawling my daughters speed would have been far faster than the turtle. It's a neat idea but I question the execution.", "This crawling turtle is so cute. It plays happy music and crawls at a slow pace. Such a cute turtle your baby will love to chase the turtle.  He is very soft with a so cute face.", "\"The Gund Crawl With Me Turtle  is a decent toy for young children starting their adventures with walking.  My daughter was already walking when I got this for her and she had a fun time chasing it around the house, at least for a short while.  Unfortunately the toy offers little visual excitement (in terms of colors) and little functionality in terms of music or motion.  There is just one tune that is played over and over again and the \"\"encouraging\"\" voice gets repetitive and rather annoying for adults.  Also, there is no way to shut off or lower the volume of the voice and the walking speed is so slow that older children tend to ignore it.  Overall it is not a bad toy, but there are more creative and colorful options available.\"", "\"Love this pretty little turtle! It's luxuriously soft to the touch, and just as cute as it can be. The tune is not cloying or annoying and doesn't go on endlessly. I can't really speak to the \"\"encouraging the baby to crawl\"\" claim, as she is only three months old. My only complaint that while it IS soft, it's not particularly cushy. I'd expect a toy for this age group to be more plush.\"", "The Gund turtle has a soft cover and a hard body - not something that I would put into the hands a child old enough to pick it up and toss it.  It crawls very well on our hardwood floor but comes to almost a complete stop on carpets or rugs.  The voice is cute for about two minutes, then you wish you could turn it off but still let it crawl.  There is an on/off button (thankfully!)It is cute and fun for young - I got it for grandchildren.  It reminds me of the noisy toys my late mother bought for my children.  She would give them their Christmas/birthday toys and laugh all the way home at how loud and obnoxious they were for us but my children loved them and wanted to play them all the time.  I made sure they found their way into the toy box she kept at her house, so turn about was fair play!  This toy would certainly have been one she would have brought.  So, I'll start the tradition with my grandchildren, too.I do recommend the toy but note that it is not for older children and the voice does get annoying.  On an unrelated note, my cat also loved the toy and tried to defeat it but it was simply too hard to stop.", "\"I received this cute, cuddly turtle and hesitated giving it to my 18-month-old daughter, since obviously she's beyond the crawling stage. This was her FAVORITE Christmas present. She was absolutely content to just play with her turtle rather than open anything else!This plush turtle is adorable. It is soft and cuddly, for the most part - the legs are not padded as much as the rest of the body (I suppose to aid in walking). The sounds are not as annoying as many reviewers express (at least I don't think so). The voice is cute (reminds me of the voice of \"\"Caillou\"\" from the children's tv show) and says things like, \"\"crawl with me, baby!\"\" It does crawl VERY slowly, which I imagine is great for babies learning to crawl. The button on the top is surprisingly very responsive, so baby can grab the turtle and it will stop walking.My daughter loves the fun music it plays, and LOVES to hold and snuggle with it.Very cute toy - highly recommended.\"", "The is a well made, and very cute, motorized plush. It slowly walks (very slowly) while encouraging your baby to follow it and touch it. It walks well on hard floors and on short, firm pile carpets. It doesn't work on shag carpets or on top of a play mat. The song and voice are not annoying (if you have a lot of talking toys you know what I mean). It is very well padded and the motorized parts do not seem to pose a hazard for a baby. Replacing the three AA batteries was easy.My six month old likes it, as does her 3 year old brother. This actually gives them an opportunity to play together.", "I love this toy! It is such a wonderful combo of plush lovey toy and activity toy. All the baby has to do is pop his or her hand down on the back of the turtle to make it move, make music, and talk (would have given it 5 stars if it didn't talk, the voice is annoying.) Others have complained that the turtle is slow -- that's one of the things I love about it. It moves just enough to make it interesting and to reinforce the action that occurs with the baby when it presses on the turtle's back. As with all Gund toys, this is sturdily made,but cushy enough to be very lovable and huggable. I recommend this for any child four months-1 year.", "I've always had a fondness for Gund toys and when I saw the Crawl with Me Turtle being offered, I melted. Truly, what baby could resist such an adorable plush toy, much less one that WALKS! And trust me, it's just as cute in person as the one in the picture.The problem is that it talks or, more specifically, that its voice can neither be turned off nor the volume lowered. Unlike some of the reviewers here, I actually found the voice and its accompanying music kind of cute and the baby who received it didn't find it off-putting in the least. But loud is extremely annoying, regardless of how cute, and cute can be wearying after a point. A little respite would not come amiss here.Other than that, the Gund Crawl with Me Turtle is a nice piece of workmanship. Yes, it's plush covering a hard body but I would think it has to be rigid in order to walk. As long as nothing's poking through the plush that can scratch or poke a baby, it's fine. Too, it's pretty slow (it reminds me of my mom's adage that villagers who couldn't outrun the Frankenstein monster deserved what they got). But so what? Babies tend to start out slow and once they speed up, they need no encouragement whatsoever to move about (this is when parents have to start looking for containment devices). No complaints on the speed score here.The Gund Crawl with Me Turtle is, for the most part, a toy that I think most babies will like. True, it can be annoying to parents and caregivers but it's ultimately all about the kids anyway. And it's my understanding that there's research supporting the notion that babies NEED to crawl in order to develop gross and fine motor skills. Give Crawl with Me Turtle a shot--chances are good your baby will respond favorably to his new buddy. :)", "\"I own few Gund animals and they are all very cute and top notch quality.I think the turtle is adorable. The voice and music is good and not over the top. Baby voice giggles and says \"\"let's crawl together\"\", \"\"let's go baby\"\", \"\"catch me\"\", \"\"this is fun\"\", \"\"follow me\"\"  etc.One round of crawling and sound is about 40 seconds and turtle moves for about 40 inches.I think this toy is the best for beginner crawlers to encourage them to start moving (for my son plastic bottle worked well;)Also there is no way baby will hurt itself, the turtle is very soft, especially the top. Batteries compartment is well protected (screwdriver needed). The light sage color makes it unisex and this could be great addition to infant toys (the color on the picture is more grey, in person is nice light green).\"", "This is an absolutely ADORABLE gift for a new baby, or one that's in the crawling phase.  Maybe even a 1st birthday gift for a new walker.  Any adult who receives this gift will find it incredibly cute.  It's MUCH softer than you would expect a mechanical to toy to be (it's a Gund!), and is quite entertaining to listen to and watch.On the other hand, if you're a parent, it might not be the best toy to buy for *your* baby.  Why?  My 8-month old daughter doesn't actually crawl after it.  She doesn't tap it.  She just watches - in amazement - for 30 seconds and then crawls off, sometimes before it's done walking.  I'm not sure that it's really worth it for just that.Her 3-year old big brother does enjoy tapping it and making it crawl, so it's sort of a game they can play together...  but this toy isn't cheap, and I have to imagine there might be better places for my dollars to go.Let me know if your little ones behave differently.  I'll certainly update this review if my little girl starts to crawl after it more, or if I see other babies react differently.", "This little gentle charmer would make a marvelous shower gift or baby gift.  It's a gentle toy, nothing loud, nothing frightening, it doesn't move too quickly. It rather reminds me of the way kid's toys USED to be...not so fast paced and flashy, just a nice gentle friend for your new baby.It certainly caught the attention of both babies we introduced Corky to (yea, we named him Corky).  They smiled and kicked their little legs...so we know it's a winner!  Corky will go on to amuse lots of babies as they enter our home, and we know they will leave with a smile.", "\"The Crawl With Me Turtle is cute and soft and very fun for a little one to chase and catch, the downfall is the thing won't stop talking when you turn it on. I read the product description and thought more musical and less chatterbox but I got the opposite. The music is cheery and delightful but it stops every 15-20 seconds to say \"\"catch me baby\"\" or \"\"almost, keep going\"\" things that are positive and should encourage baby to crawl and drive the parents up the wall. I do turn it on quite frequently for my son but this isn't something we leave on for too long due to it's chatty nature, if it were simply musical I would like it a lot more. I like that baby can 'catch' it and stop it from moving, it is a little game my boy likes to play, but sometimes the toy does not register that he has caught it and it proceeds to flee from my child.\"", "\"My daughter is close to crawling so I liked the idea of a turtle that would crawl with her when she started to crawl. The turtle says phrases such as \"\"Crawl with me\"\", \"\"You're doing great baby\"\" and \"\"Catch me.\"\" These phrases are nice encouragement for the baby but for a parent, they start to grow old fast as does the music that plays as the turtle crawls. It only plays ONE song as it crawls, which I find to be monotonous and more song variety would make the turtle more appealing as would more phrases or just a music only option. She gets bored with him after a few minutes.Another issue I found with the turtle is that he crawls really well on hard floors, but if you have a thicker carpet or put him on a blanket on the floor with the baby, he gets stuck and doesn't move very well. When he does crawl, he moves pretty slowly - it would be nice if it had a mechanism to change the crawl speed as baby gets more proficient with crawling.Overall, the idea was better than the delivery of this product. While my baby likes it fine, I wouldn't purchase it for the asked price though given all the downsides.\"", "I realize turtles are usually slow, but this is a VERY slow moving toy.  It is a lot of fun for a baby just learning to reach and crawl, but I wish it had different settings so it would grow with a crawling baby.  It is absolutely adorable and it will keep their attention, so it gets 4 stars.  :)", "\"I love the brand Gund.  My daughter has a few Gund stuffed animals and I was excited to add this turtle to the collection. Turtles are also my moms favorite animal, so she was super excited too.  I have never owned a Gund \"\"animated plush\"\".First impression:  When the toy arrived, the packaging threw me off a little.  It came wrapped in a plastic bag and seemingly thrown in box. Um. Okay. No big deal, and may have been just a Vine thing, but it definitely was not \"\"gift worthy\"\" if you're planning on sending it as a gift.The next thing I noticed was how study the turtle felt - cool, that means it can handle my 15 month old.  However, the four legs are thinly covered pieces of metal (not a very squishy toy).  The rest looked exactly like the picture with accurate colors.Crawling: This thing moves SLOW or not at all.  Sometimes it just makes the motion.  My daughter does not mind, and she still thought it was great.  She was thoroughly entertained for at least 10 minutes* the first time we used it.  My two cats also seemed to think it was pretty interesting as a bonus.Sounds:  The melody is fine, the words of encouragement become a little annoying. (\"\"Crawl with me baby! Touch my shell! Now you got it baby!\"\" etc)  The sound is a cute (or creepy) happy little kid voice.  I will mimic others and say that if I had to change one thing, I'd really really like an on/off switch for the sounds, because without it being \"\"on\"\" its just a semi-stuffed animal. It is a shame that it can't crawl and be silent.  My daughter though does like the voice, and seems to enjoy touching the shell (activating the voice) of the turtle when she walks by.Overall, I would recommend this toy.  It is cute and fun, my daughter really loves it, my mom (nana) adores it, and for what it is - a fun interactive toy, I really like it.(*10 minutes it pretty good in toddler-time)\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.050618913024663925, 0.05121322721242905, 0.05040987581014633, 0.054193396121263504, 0.05262813717126846, 0.049876581877470016, 0.052371710538864136, 0.05333948880434036, 0.04960564523935318, 0.05644958093762398, 0.04464859142899513, 0.048260413110256195, 0.04856956750154495, 0.04551238566637039, 0.04951857030391693, 0.05073289945721626, 0.05025156959891319, 0.045387521386146545, 0.047823794186115265, 0.04858808591961861]]}
