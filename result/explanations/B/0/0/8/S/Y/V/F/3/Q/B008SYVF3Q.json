"], "reviews": ["I was recently in France, and marveled at the flavor of the food, and the care in which it was made and presented. Since my trip, I have been spending more time enjoying the preparation of my food, and in eating the results...and when I saw San Francisco Salt Company's French Grey Salt, I thought, voila! This is the salt I need.It makes all the difference what salt you use, and San Francisco Salt Company makes salt that is absolutely delectable. You also need less of it, so it's healthier, and also more economical. This French Grey Salt is hand-harvested from the marshes of Guerande, the Breton medieval town, where the art of salt making dates back to the Middle Ages.Sprinkle some of this salt on meats (remember you will need less than you do with regular salt!) and add some to your salad dressing to make your fresh greens to die for delicious. Try it. Like me, you'll become a San Francisco Salt Company fan after just a few meals.", "Our garden tomatoes started coming in last week.  Oh, how we wait all year for these 10 weeks of fresh tomatoes!  And, for some reason, they are exceptionally flavorful this year.  (We consider it a blessing; they are not always this good eatin'!)This French grey salt allows the flavor of the tomato to shine through.  The salt--a bit milder than most, and not as &#34;salty&#34;--works very well with fresh tomatoes.  It brings out a certain sweetness in the tomatoes.  And the tomato, in turn, brings out a tangy-ness in the salt.  Together they make quite a pair and bring out the best in each other.I know that a lot of chefs put this salt up on a pedestal and use it for all their cooking, but I think its flavors are too delicate to waste on adding to dishes with a lot of flavors.  I think it works best with simple, pure flavors and little competition in tastes.*I received a sample product from SF Salt Co.", "I'm not really an expert on salts, but agreed to write a review in exchange for some samples. I have used the French Grey Salt in a whole range of dishes, including vegetables, meats, fish, sea food, eggs, and sauces. I have used it sparingly since I don't like overly-salty food, and it adds a very subtle flavor boost to everything I used it in. I didn't experience a big difference between the French Gray and Himalayan Salt, but I think the French Grey was a little more subtle. We live in a very damp climate (Oregon Coast), so I kept the salt in the plastic pouch it came in and haven't had any problems with it clumping or dissolving in the container. I really like that the only ingredient is sea salt and that you use less salt for flavoring. I have been using the 5 oz. packet and recommend it.", "I've used French Grey salt for a few years now.  A lot of brands WILL come slightly damp, but the sample that I received for review from San Francisco Salt company is quite dry.  The 'damp' comes form the harvesting process and it can come a bit damp according to the label, but mine was nice and dry compared to other brands, which is nice, because that means I get more salt and less water for my money.The color is very light grey.  The taste is exception.  The thing about french grey sea salt that is harvest in this old way- and they do use the ancient way to get this salt- it just taste 'light' at first and then the salt flavor builds gradually, and it somehow just FILLS the mouth and gives a slick mouth feel as the flavor fades.  Whereas regular salt just is, this salt 'blooms' in the mouth.This is an excellent brand.  I'd certainly recommend it to anyone - from cooks that know their salt, to people just starting to experiment with gourmet salts.", "\"I grew up with Morton's salt and had never even heard of natural sea salts until I was nearly middle aged.  When I read that \"\"table salt\"\" is actually highly processed, has had all the beneficial minerals removed and contains ferrocyanide, talc, or silica aluminate added to make it more free-flowing, I decided to try natural sea salts.  Since that day I've never looked back!  There's just no comparison in the flavor of natural sea salts versus generic table salt.  Sea salt has naturally occurring potassium, selenium and magnesium - minerals our body needs, which are absent in table salt.  Also, the naturally occurring iodine in sea salt is more easily absorbed than the iodine artificially added to table salt.This San Francisco Salt Company French grey salt is a delicious compliment to any foods.  I used it last night on steamed broccoli and grilled salmon.  It added a subtle, mineral-rich flavor that enhanced the natural flavors of the food, and it took less of it to season than with table salt.  The salt I received was dry and could be poured, although sometimes grey salt is moist and needs to be pinched up and disbursed by rubbing your fingertips together.  There's a reason that chefs often prefer grey salt for their dishes - it just tastes better!I received a complimentary sample of the fine grained French Grey Salt for review purposes.\"", "I always thought, salt was salt. The past few months, I've learned that there is a difference between the table salt I've been using for A LOT of years & the natural sea, Chef salts sold by San Fransisco Salt Company. Their Gourmet Chef Salts really wake up the flavor of foods I prepare for my family.French Grey Chef Salt is naturally moist due to its harvesting process, & has a mild salt flavor. It can be used on a variety of foods & is fast becoming a family favorite. The French Grey Salt in the 5 oz package can be used in a salt shaker; however, it might clog because it is naturally moist & does not have any anti-caking ingredients added. As a matter of fact, San Fransisco Salt Company salt is all natural with no added ingredients & retains all the natural minerals & colors found in the area it's harvested.This particular chef's salt, French Grey, has an interesting history. French Grey Salt is formed as sea water flows into France's Guerande Marshes during high tides. It is still hand harvested using ancient Celtic skills & methods - over a thousand years old. It's gathered from clay bottomed beds, rich in minerals that leach into the salt, giving it its grey tint. It is naturally moist and used by the top chefs in France & all around the world.If you're new to chef salts like I was, you will be amazed at the colors & flavors San Fransisco Salt Company carries.I'll list a few for you:Cherrywood Smoked Sea Salt (5oz Pouch - Fine Grain)Alderwood Smoked Sea Salt (5oz Pouch Fine Grain)Sherpa Pink Gourmet Himalayan Salt (5lb Bag Fine Grain)Hawaiian Black Lava Finishing Salt (5oz pouch Fine Grain)Red Alaea Hawaiian Salt (5oz pouch Fine Grain)Fleur de Sel - 5oz PouchFrench Grey Salt can be used in every recipe & is a good choice for an all-around salt.

San Fransisco Salt Company also sells the jars w/spoon  so you can fill them yourself:8oz Glass Jar with SpoonI've purchased several San Francisco Salt Company products & have never been disappointed in their quality.Satisfaction Guaranteedsample provided for honest review", "This coarse French grey sea salt is the genuine salt used every day at French tables:  it is harvested from the Gu&eacute;rande salt pools in Britanny much as it has been for over a thousand years and it carries the Nature & Progr&egrave;s certification.  This particular product is superior in taste and appearance to the run-of-the-mill sea salt that comes in tall canisters at the grocery store.The natural coloring and complex mineral flavor is a result of the sea water from which it comes as well as from the clay soil that forms the evaporation pools.  It is very good for everyday use and after using a good sea salt like this, it is difficult to go back to a pure and flavorless salt for use at the table.  It will make plain dishes such as poached eggs and baked potatoes especially flavorful and is very good sprinkled on tomato juice as well.For those who are restricting sodium intake, consider using a salt such as this one to get the most pleasure out of the limited salt that is used at the table.A sample was provided by San Francisco Salt Company for unbiased review.", "A mild, classic salt, traditionally harvested in France. Fine-grained with a clean flavor and no aftertaste. The light grey color is a shade darker than typical table salt, but not as grey as I expected.As a gourmet salt neophyte, this and Himalayan Pink were the only chef's salts I had heard of.  That fame makes this a good gift choice for the foodie in your life. Like most specialty salts, I suggest serving this French Grey table-side in a small bowl to be spooned over the meal, so its appearance and origin can be appreciated.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]This 5oz pouch is a nice, inexpensive way to indulge in the world of gourmet salts. Recommended.", "I have not used gourmet salts before. I was contacted by the San Francisco Salt Company to try some of their salts. The French Grey was one that they sent. I wasn't sure how to best use this salt, but I found one really good use for it. I put it on the cut surfaces of a plum that I then grilled. It is my new favorite thing. I made some for my daughter and she agrees. The slightly salty taste contrasted nicely with the sweet/tart plum.My daughter also took a fresh from the garden tomato and cut it into several pieces. She then put a different salt on each piece. Her conclusion is that the darker the salt, the more intense the flavor. The Red Alea was the darkest I had, with the Sherpa Pink, French Grey, and Pure Flake Salt being the others. The Flake salt is a coarser grain, so that could have made it's flavor stronger, even though it was the lightest.", "I've used French sea salt before, but it's been Mediterranean salt. This French Grey (full disclosure: provided to me for review by the company) is my first trial of Atlantic French sea salt.It's sourced from the ocean about halfway down the western side of France, from a town noted for farming salt. While it's collected in evaporation pans, like all commercial sea salt, the difference is that the salt touches the pans (not usually the case), giving the salt a grey color.It turns out that this is a high-moisture salt (and the company stresses that you shouldn't be shocked if on delivery it seems damp). The practical meaning is that it's as if it is highly concentrated and you should be careful how much you use. The mechanism is that, being moist already, it doesn't absorb as much moisture from whatever you use it with, and so a little goes a long way. The crystals are also fairly large.In flavor, though, it's mild (although &#34;delicate&#34; is an overstatement). It's great to use with vegetables and on salads. It's less appropriate for meats, especially strong meats such as game. It will go well in light sauces, adding a hint of its own flavor without dominating. I like to sprinkle it on avocados and melons, believe it or not; the complex salt adds something special to the sweetness of the melon and the butteriness of the avocado.The packaging is a simple envelope. Definitely keep it in a tightly sealed glass jar or something similarly airtight. It's already moist enough and, depending on your climate, you don't want to change its qualities by either getting it moister or drying it out.Overall four stars for a good product and a good value, but one star off for the packaging. If you're familiar with other sea salts, this one might pleasantly surprise you, as it did me.", "This is a fairly mild salt but just a little dash will really improve the quality of almost any food to which you you would usually add some salty flavoring.  You will be surprised how long a five pound bag lasts even though you'll be using this salt frequently in the kitchen.  I received a free sample in exchange for a review from San Franciso Salt Company."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.09839589893817902, 0.09500688314437866, 0.09894110262393951, 0.09488710761070251, 0.06039102002978325, 0.08854621648788452, 0.08262458443641663, 0.09348609298467636, 0.09057442098855972, 0.10363790392875671, 0.09350879490375519]]}
