For me, it is the first in the series I've had the pleasure to play and I enjoyed the heck out of it.I'm a Nintendo guy, having grown up with their consoles and just really enjoy their games.  So for the Wii U, I've finally been able to get a taste of other franchises I've always kind of wanted to play but have never had the chance.First off, I love the setting of the game.  It does a fantastic job of tying in the history of the American Revolution with the Assassin's timeline.  I'll admit that I'm probably not up on my history in the years since I've been out of school, but I got a kick out of seeing Benjamin Franklin and George Washington interact with my character and the fun Connor-led missions that tied into important parts in the war.I love the game play, it's very simple and satisfying.  The combat with your combination of attacks and counters made fighting a pleasure and stealth and assassin kills satisfying to pull off.  I can't compare the freerunning mechanic from this game with the previous games and their majestic skylines, having never played them, but I had a lot of fun running through the forests and scaling old school churches and synchronizing my views.When the world opens up after the first few hours, it's easy to get lost hunting and collecting feathers at your own leisure.  I spent a lot of time ignoring missions and just doing my own thing until I got tired of it and got back on point.  I probably had more fun than I should have crafting and selling items, trying to get the greatest profit I could.  I'm not big on simulator games, but I have to imagine this portion of the game is rewarding to the type of person who digs those tycoon type of games.Of course in addition to all of that is the absolutely stunning naval battles.  Just like everyone else, I enjoyed every chance I could get to board my ship and start sinking the heck out of Redcoats.  And the quest for Captain Kidd's treasure just sweetened the naval deal.  Lots of fun to be had here, and it just makes the pirate based Assassin's Creed: Black Flag look that much more appealing.Graphics wise, I thought the game looked great.  I can't compare it to the other big boy consoles as I've never owned them, but for a Nintendo boy like myself, they were more than fine and better than we're used to.  I know there's been a bit of problem with glitches and whatnot, but what little weird glitches I ran into really didn't bother me too much. There was a floating bear here, a disappearing deer there, but nothing that really took away from my experience playing the game.A couple of things that may bug some people:  I don't know, maybe I'm not the expert gamer that some people are, but some of the stealthier missions come across as a little difficult because the bad guys seem to notice you no mater what you do.  That could just be player caused, but it seemed to happen a lot.  I ended up getting into huge group fights more often than not.Also, the beginning of the game rewards the patient.  It is several hours (or at least seems like it) before the game opens up.  Thankfully, this portion of the game is fun to play and it gets you used to the style of play the Assassin's games seem to be known for.  You also get to play as the swarthy Haytham, who is a much more fun character than Connor to spend time with.Of course I have to make a mention of off screen play with the Wii U Gamepad.  It seems some people find the Gamepad to be a useless add on, but I'm digging it for the simple things it does.  Having the map on the gamepad is a simple yet effective use of the controller.  And the off screen play is very cool for a guy like me with wife and kids.  Thanks to that one feature, it took me half the time completing the game being able to still play while the TV screen itself is dominated by Curious George and the X-Factor.All in all, a very pleasing experience.  It's a big game with a lot of stuff to do and keep you occupied.  I wish the rewards for some of these tasks were a little more hefty, but it was still fun to do.  The story is cool and the gameplay is simple enough for non-hardcore gamer and satisfying enough for everyone.  I really dug the game and if a lot of people are right and it's not as good as the second game in the series, I can't wait to play that one.", "This has to be the best Assassin's Creed yet. I've always played them on the 360, but I was insanely excited when they announced the this game for the Wii U. I highly recommend getting this game.", "\"Same old, same old.Good point- Improved graphicsAre much cleaner than the previous works.I think the point of the molding face was unnatural Liberation previous work in particular, has been improved and now good work properly in.* Introduction of the BattleI think this is the best success in this work.It is something fairly enjoyable than normally advance the story. The Bad Making the entire work is sloppy.Now his many attempts that is different from the previous software has been incorporated.Therefore it is, however, a very large sweet crafted most irresponsible specification.The large number of bugs that other people have already mentioned, not to mention it is the changing of the seasons can also sloppy weather, over time, for example, which was one of the selling.In heavy rain is falling, and I am Kiwamarinai unnatural or are residents of the city to walk or talk calmly.I do not think too much of an effort to develop a new engine, only to have neglected the most basic part of the adjustment.I-unfriendliness that thorough of the piecesMap is not buried completely in sync in the view point, picking and door chests tedious one by one, dim when selecting wheel arms (see below for details) enemies that come out frame Walla Walla, and carrying inconvenient and cumbersome such as dissatisfaction fine point which did not come out kiri if we like.The problem is that resulting from the point did not have to fiddle with most of them at all from the traditional ones yet.I struggle to understand why the system was cumbersome far worse. Vexatiousness unusual enemyThis is the point where the ball is at his best now stood.I think that will not come out because the strategic defeat monotonically as before by changing the combat system, we need to work to have become, and I can have pros and cons.However, the balance itself enemy has collapsed too.The assassination alone in the city, even after the battle does not end until next spring when the infinite with high probability.I can decide to fight back and counter I also very tired to survive and counter attack ... also been suspended immediately after the onslaught begins.Watch the human vision has been away, approaching at about infiltration is found unreasonable.Although the motion battle quickly became much, I is almost no exhilaration.It could not be expected to kill a sense of pseudo Warriors before selling it, and would want to take time to rank and file so far. Nastiness of sub-goalsThere are target in each part of the story is set, it is clear that 100% \"\"full sync\"\" in achieving it.This system itself had been adopted before, many things about a bonus, so to speak, can easily be achieved with some exceptions, did not need to be particularly aware of.In this work it is a nasty affairs content is on parade, and less towards the objectives that are not frustrating however.What do you come to full self-satisfaction of an extrusion production bother ...I remember from when you purchase the Liberation previous play was too much compared with the contents of the Kawaribae Brotherhood, it was felt that rut honest.When I think back, I think what was corrupt in all directions like this work to have been able to play and enjoy some of the difference, but complaints.Some things have been expected that the new development, this was a disappointment too can also deduct it.I think the series is definitely going to continue because the title of the UBI soft signage, to liver by all means, that the fan is that we are disillusioned if you carry on the work of subsequent deterioration of this work so that I am as long as I want Meijiru.Sincerely hope that you redeem honor is done in the next work.\"", "I got this game for cheap at only $40. I have never played any of the other Assassin's Creed games. Jumping right into the story will certainly make you confused and not sure what is happening. There is probably a deep and meaningful plot here, but unless you played the other games you won't be able to enjoy it that much. Get use to watching cut scenes if you play this game because there is a lot of them and most of the cut scenes are full dialog only. However, the voice acting and writing is top notch so don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort put into them, but there is a very large amount of it. There is such large amount of them that it can take away from the fun factor of the game. The graphics are excellent as well is the sound. The controls are hit and miss. During more intense gameplay I find myself just hitting all the buttons because it's more affective then actually trying. Combat controls suffer the most in my opinion. Fighting enemies can be a circus act of chaos. Expect to get hit often and become frustrated. Running through the town is fun itself and fairly fluent. That part of the game is done very well. Personally, I would either get the game cheap or rent it first and see if you like the gameplay. I don't regret getting it for only $40 but I wouldn't pay much more.", "I want to give this game 3.5 stars but its a good game overall so 4 stars overall and 3 stars for the fun factor. The game is not bad at all but just couldn't keep me interested even though it has a good story.The game looks fantastic on the Wii U maybe even better than the other versions. You can move the entire HUD to the gamepad and have a more cinematic experience. So visually the game is very nice.The controls are good for the most part but in some cases they just don't respond well. For example when free running the character will start to climb barrels/railings even if you did not intend to. Also sometimes in combat with multiple people you can end up messing up your target and intended move/counter. It isn't that annoying but it does get in the way sometimes when you are trying to do something important. Basically the controls should have been more refined and just feel more solid.The game also has naval combat and even though it is nice I feel it could have been refined as well.The story is actually good and the cinematic scenes look very nice. You meet a lot of historical characters and its pretty cool being in 1700's Boston and New York. As a virtual history ride the game delivers and since I kind of like history it was cool to relive it virtually.Now the main problem I had with this game is that first of all it was way too cinematic. Even though I praised the cinematic scenes they felt excessive in my opinion. Sometimes it felt like I was just watching a movie that allowed me to interact within some scenes. I complain about this with many of today's games...I want to play not watch.My biggest complaint is that the game is not that FUN. I'm sorry but I did not enjoy this game as much as I wanted to. I mean it was fun in some parts but just not enough to keep me interested from start to finish.Still overall the game was a good virtual history ride. I finished the game but doubt I will play it again even though there are some things I didn't do...I just wish it was a bit more fun.", "I just finished the single player story and I have to say I had fun, but there wasn't really too much that blew me away. I love the Assassin's Creed series and i'm glad that Ubisoft showed more of their Nintendo support by bringing the series over to the Wii U. Hopefully at some point we'll get ports of the previous games as well. I've played all of the AC games and while this isn't my favorite, it's still atleast apart of the top 3 after ACII & AC Brotherhood. The gamepad is used well in my opinion. Having a larger map readily available was nice, and I preferred to watch the cutscenes on the gamepad as well. Even if you're new to the series, there is still fun to be had here. However, if you don't have access to the previous games i'd say atleast read up on the story or watch some walkthroughs so you're not completely lost. Overall, this is a great game and a worthy addition to any Wii U library.", "I've enjoyed all the Assassin's Creed games, and this one's no exception.  The Wii U enhancements are minor, but the larger map is actually very handy, and off-screen play and the Miiverse community are great features as usual.", "While I already had the PS3 version I had decided to get this as a two game package with Splinter Cell:Blacklist and like with the Splinter Cell this game shows the power and abilities of the WiiU incredibly.  The graphics and overall gameplay controls look and work the same as they do on the PS3/Xbox 360 but again like with SC the WiiU gamepad does offer a few added bonuses like easy access to equipment and switching weapons or items  and a bigger and more accessible map.Load time is a little longer then the PS3 version but not as long as it was like with the Splinter Cell game but again somewhat expected as the WiiU version installed about 60MB instead of the 6GB the PS3 version did.Also you won't get some of the extra SP missions you got on the PS3 but that's pretty much the only big difference between the two really.  So if you have a WiiU  this game is a pretty good one to add to your WiiU game library and for those who already have it for the PS3 or Xbox 360 I say while it's double dipping for a game you already have for the price it's worth getting.  You might be surprised at how more entertaining you find the WiiU version is then you might think.", "Assassin's Creed is not a true open world game, can have a very short attention span at times, and it can get lost in a mire of pointless miniquests such as listening or animal hunting. It's almost like it doesn't know what it needs to be - an open-world, non-linear, stealthy assassination game. I still like it and think AC4 will be even better, but I really feel like Ubisoft is missing a chance to make something like Skyrim + Hitman + historical settings and people.As for the Wii U, it really is better on it due to graphics at least as good (maybe slightly better) than XBox or PS3, and the off-TV play is great as usual and an underrated feature on the console itself. You don't buy a Wii U to play third-party titles, but if you only have a Wii U, then is worth getting, especially at the discount price of twenty bucks.", "Seems a bit bland compared to other AC games -- but I warmed up to the gameplay and story eventually.", "I've played this on Xbox 360 and this version looks identical. The game pad displays the games cut scenes and a map during gameplay. This is a great launch title and definitely a good game to show some of the potential of the Wii U.", "This is a great little game with a huge price tag.  great graphics and no education.  Just what the doctor ordered."], "Gamma": [0.055189099162817, 0.05521000176668167, 0.05518852174282074, 0.05518936365842819, 0.0554019920527935, 0.05519083887338638, 0.05527348443865776,
