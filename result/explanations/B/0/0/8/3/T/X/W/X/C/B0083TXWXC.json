It can be configured in a few different ways, with four main parts (aside from the clip). We find the full concoction to have a good feel for both adults and kids -- hefty enough to be sturdy without being too heavy. And there's something satisfying about the thunk of the firing mechanism, both in sound and feel. It looks great, too. The recommended age is 8+, but my almost-7-year-old handles it with aplomb. The clip and round-chambering mechanism are pretty easy to use; easier than some other Nerf guns.The range and accuracy are great. Aiming at our basketball backboard from the far end of the property makes for a tough but reasonable challenge. And the deep blue darts stand out well in the tall grass when it comes time to collect 'em.", "\"This is pretty powerful with the new color darts.I was worried initially that this was yet another new dart only gun, but it will take the standard orange darts, they just won't fly as far.Nice addition to the Nerf range, not as good as the Vortex disc system ones, but pretty cool nonetheless.I read reviews about this being the most powerful \"\"unmodded\"\" gun, but then I was never interested in stripping a kids toy down to make it more dangerous anyway, guess I will take the other reviewers word for that. For me this one is plenty powerful, just be prepared to lose a lot of darts!\"", "My sons already have nerf blasters, so I gave to my 55 year old husband to battle with them.  It is so cool works easy with pull of a trigger and best of all it is convertable. It can be made into 4 configurations different styles of guns. It shoots the darts really far, we got at least 60 feet, another plus is the removable quick reload clip. This is as much fun as paint ball but a lot safer.", "This is one of Nerf's modular guns, an effort to produce more variation from a base blaster and various add-ons. In this case, the Retaliator consists of a hand blaster, rear stock, front barrel extension and front hand grip. You can put them all together to get a long gun with front handgrip or strip them all off for a one handed blaster.As far as looks go, it's pretty good. This blaster comes in a blue and orange motif and stands out quite nicely, the silver and black trim makes it quite classy. The added stock and front barrel makes it quite substantial. And the front barrel is not just for looks. The inside of it is smoothly rifled, designed to make the dart spin for additional accuracy. So top marks for looks. And you can also add extras like scopes or different stocks and barrels from other Nerf modular kits to make your own customized look, so top marks for design and versatility as well.Function. OK, so what you want in any dart blaster is power, speed and accuracy in a dart blaster fight. When you're in a fight, you want something with a lot of darts, easy to pump and quick to shoot. And in a firefight, I'd strip off all the non-essentials so the stock and barrels wouldn't get in the way.Darts: A 12 dart magazine is not bad and if you have extra magazines, it's pretty easy to load as long as you're familiar with it. The magazine can only be popped out if the slide is pulled back and locked when the slide is moved forward. This Elite blaster comes with the new Elite darts. Elite darts have been tested to shooter further than the old Streamline darts but this blaster can use any of the clip type darts.Ease of use: For function it all comes down to the one handed blaster unit, everything else is for show. For example, in order to pump and load the gun, your non trigger hand will have to move the top slider back and forth and be on it all the time, so the front grip is superfluous in a fire fight.The design is good for looks, but the slider is full of edges and angles, no smooth surface at all, so to me that's a design flaw; a slider, because your hand needs to be gripping and moving it all the time, cannot have sharp edges. And the top slider is not the most intuitive place to pump your gun; the front grip is the most intuitive place to place your hand to pump the gun.Power and speed: Despite the slider only moving 3-4 inches to pump, this blaster is deceptively powerful. I can't believe such a short pump distance packs such a powerful punch. That is because this Elite blaster uses a new direct plunger type system with more power than the old reverse plunger system. Well, all you need to know is that this type of system is more powerful :-) Speed is very good, and without jamming. But it's not the most accurate of blasters due to the darts. I'm not a great fan of these clip darts.Overall, looks good, fast and powerful. With the new 18 dart magazines that are available, you can now have a powerful dart blaster that can shoot 18 darts at a time.", "Having mastered the deadly arts of the Nerf N-Force blades, my son and I set our sights on the more advanced weaponry of the N-Strike line, and what better way to start than with the N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blaster? This massive foam dart weapon boasts multiple configurations, an easy to fill ammunition clip and a range of 75 feet.With the Retaliator, you can remove the stock and the barrel, allowing you to decide how big or small you want this to be. The longer barrel gives you a bit more accuracy, and my son likes leaving the stock on just to balance the thing out. Larger players may be satisfied with just the main piece. Either way, changing the elements out is pretty simple, as is refilling and loading the clip.My only real gripe with the Retaliator is that if you don't rack it hard when you're shooting, the darts (the newer Elite style, by the way) can jam and even get shredded. This may cause some frustration with younger players. Aside from that, my son and I are both very happy with the Retaliator. It's a fun addition to our Nerf arsenal, though it did have me making a quick order for some protective eyewear.", "\"We just received theNerf N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blasteryesterday and already have had lots of fun with it.  It's a pretty decent size (I'm 5'7 and it's about the length from my shoulder to the tips of my fingers, fully assembled) and weight, but not too heavy or cumbersome to play with.It took a few minutes to get it out of the box and set up.  The assembly was pretty intuitive, I only had to look at the directions to figure out out to get the ammo clip in.What I like about it:-Sturdy plastic body and parts, not cheaply made so I expect it to last awhile, even with teen boys using it-The colors are fun-It is actually 4 blasters (the PC term for nerf guns) in one.  You can take the front part off and have a smaller rifle type weapon or take it down even further for a handgun.-It shoots about 75 feet if you do it right (shooting upwards), that's a pretty decent distance.  Shooting straight will get you about 50 feet, still pretty good.  I've also noticed that it shoots a bit further when it's the handgun style, which makes sense.-the darts are a little heavier than other Nerf blasters so when they hit the object, they noticeably bounce off and feel solid, so it's a lot more fun to fire.-it apparently can be used with parts from other blasters in the Nerf N-Strike Elite series which is a bonus if you collect these blasters and want to create your own modified version.-It shoots with sort of a \"\"plunger\"\" type action, so you pump it each time you shoot, which is fun.-From what I've been told, this blaster is the new and improved version of the Recon blaster.What I didn't like:-a few of the darts crumpled up and get jammed in the barrel.  I'm not sure what happened because we used it according to the instructions, but we lost two darts already (it comes with 12)-it has jammed a few times and I can't figure out what is causing it to do that-I have a hard time getting the clip in/out.  I think it's just me, rather than a defect in the construction - it might improve as we use it longer.All in all, it's a really fun gun, er, I mean, blaster that all of the kids in the neighborhood have loved shooting.  You can buy extra clips for faster re-loading.\"", "\"This is a very nice gun, solidly built like most Nerfs.  It's interesting that after Nerf rolled out the Vortex line of disk-type launchers that they'd go back to the dart blasters.  Having said that, these guns use the same slimline darts from earlier Nerfs, except that they're now called Elite Darts.  They might be of better construction, but for my house, they get stepped on or bent after a few uses, and they basically become slimline darts in terms of quality.  Oh, well!I didn't use any formal measuring devices, just an eyeballing of distances, but it seems to me that this blaster can hit 50 feet indoors, less outdoors.  No 75 feet for me, but that's okay, it's not like you have enough accuracy at that range anyway.In summary, this is a nice nerf gun, basically a second generation of the N-Strike Longshot, but with \"\"elite\"\" darts, and a bigger magazine.  I don't think this has a formal \"\"CS\"\" in the description, but it does use the clip system, so you CAN use the 35 round drum from your favorite Raider CS35.  Have fun with that!Overall, recommended.\"", "I wouldn't recommend this dart blaster for any child under 8 or 9 years of age. The darts come out pretty quickly and they shoot a long way...I would say 50 feet or more. It is the perfect size for young hands to play with, and is colorful which makes it even more attractive to children.While this toy is quite durable, I don't see a lot of educational value other than instructing the kids to never aim at anyone's face or body...which will translate to any gun...real or otherwise. The little cousins played with it for about an hour in the backyard and they lost 2 darts over the fence into the neighbor's yard. Since I am currently not on speaking terms with that neighbor I doubt I'll ever see them again. Overall, we liked this N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blaster better than our previous Nerf guns because the darts went further. The accuracy was inconsistent as we often missed our targets. It couldn't possibly be our marksmanship :-) A good, fun toy for the price.", "My child is thoroughly enjoying this toy. The product quality is typical of Nerf products and highly satisfactory. The weight, colors, and size are perfect for a 10-year old boy.The speed with which he darts blast and the distance they travel are amazing. Only problem is with finding the darts after blasting them. I am pretty sure that most of the darts will be lost in just a few days.As for the 4 configurations, that claim is a little disappointing. Technically, yes, 4 configs are possible. Only two of those configurations look good and functional.Overall, this is a good product and I envision my child using it for several years. I would recommended it.", "Pretty much perfect for a thirteen year old!There are three interchangeable parts with this unit- stock,  barrel extension, stock grip and all attach easily.This comes with 12- just 12 darts- so go ahead and order some more right now!  Twelve miserly darts for this. The 75 foot shooting distance means you will lose some- but it also means you can hit your target from a long way off. And the clip reload allows for rapid firing.This is a terrific gun for kids eight and up for sure."], "Gamma": [0.05000638589262962, 0.05780041217803955, 0.05934235826134682, 0.004632190335541964,
