"], "reviews": ["I took this for a long weekend trip out of town, and was very pleased with the convenience. It worked wonderful as a flat addition to my suitcase.I was able to use the mesh pockets for easy access into the bag.  The pockets are wide enough for hair products, shampoos, brushes.I also used the side pockets for items that I did not have a need for easy access to.  One one side, I was able to use the expansion for larger bottles.Once I got to the hotel, I simple opened it up and used the hangar.  The bag also has a nice carrying handle.  The color is blue and neutral enough for men or women to use.Once inside the suitcase, it layed flat over the clothes.  There was no bulge, and certainly no need to carry extra travel kits.There is enough for quite a bit of personal items,  And if you don't have it filled, it is nice for light packing.  Excellent, easy to use, lightweight, and packs great..  Product received as gift from company ..Rizzo", "David sent me a Hanging Travel Toiletry Case to review. First off, I like the color. It's a guy's color and bag. Second I like the hook inside that allows you to hang the bag rather than set it on the counter. This is convenient as long as there is a place to hang it from.You can look at the pictures and see that there are a number of pockets. One large in the middle and then end pockets on each end. One on the left and two on the right, with the far right being an expanding pocket if you need it. (It expands by unzipping a zipper.)Besides the convenience of being able to hang the bag, it is easier to pack because of how it lays flat. Previous bags that I packed my toiletries in were a bit more bulky.  This is longer obviously, but lays out flat on top of everything else.  Makes it easy to put into the suit case, especially when these are the items I usually pack last after the final shower before leaving.I like that the bag holds everything I take.  Large thing of hair gel, hair brush, large contact solution bottle, toothpaste and toothbrush, floss, shampoo, deodorant, shave cream and razor, and still room for a few other things.I will say that at 29.99 the price is a bit steep.  But I do like the bag and all that it holds and how it lays out. And again, I like the hook to hang it. Bottom line, it is a good travel bag for toiletries.", "\"When I travel and live out of the suitcase I like being organized. I typically travel with the content stored in various plastic bags to keep things organized.  This Toiletry Bag is going to replace quite a few of my plastic bags! One feature that I really like that it has a hanger so you can hang it in the bathroom rod.  This solves a problem with cramped bathrooms which do not have enough room to lay things out!The bag is made out of light nylon. When it is empty if weights 7.9 oz.  It has a total of 4 compartments.I am attaching a collage of 4 numbered photos (they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo).Here are the details about the bag compartments and dimensions:1. Photo #1 shows bag closed with just the hanger pulled out of the middle compartment.  I hang it this way in the hotel bathroom when it is not used.When the organizer is closed it is 16\"\" by 11\"\" by 2\"\" in size.2. Photo #2 shows the expansion zipper. One of the compartments can be made bigger or smaller by use of this expansion zipper. It gives an additional 2.5 inches of room in one of the side compartments.If the zipper is closed the right compartment is 1\"\" (width) x 2\"\"(height) x 10.5\"\" in size, with the zipper opened it becomes 3.5\"\" (width) x 2\"\" (height) x 10.5\"\". If you look at picture #3 and #4, this compartment is the first one on the right.3. The second compartment from the right is 2.5\"\" x 2.5\"\" x 10.5\"\"4. The third compartment flips open and has two mesh pockets. One of the mesh pockets has a zipper, the second one ends with a rubber band. This compartment is 7\"\" x 10.5\"\" x 2\"\" in size.Photos #3 and #4 shows this compartment opened.The hanging hook as well as the handle are attached to this middle compartment. The design is such that allows to hang the bag either opened or closed, which is pretty handy!5. The fourth compartment (left most in picture #3 and #4) is sized 3.75\"\" (width) by 10.5\"\" by 2\"\" (height).I received an evaluation copy of this travel toiletry bag from Davidsbeenhere to write an honest and unbiased review.I found it to be a well designed and thought through organizer. It is light, the zippers work well. It kept me well organized and made it easy to find things even when there was not a lot of surface area in the hotel bathroom. I have no hesitation in recommending it!Ali Julia review\"", "This is a toiletry bag with a larger zippered pocket and three smaller pockets, one on one side of the larger pocket and two on the other.  One of these two pockets expands.The larger pocket, when zipped open, has a hanger to allow the bag to be suspended from a mirror or door.  Another hanger would be nice as this one isn't centered and although the end pockets are supported, I wasn't quite sure they were.  The smaller pockets are long enough to hold a toothbrush in a case or a spray bottle of perfume.  I was able to get a toothbrush, toothpaste, a travel spray bottle of perfume, a razor, a tube of conditioner, a bottle of spray gel and a net puff for the shower in it.The center holds over eight different sizes bottles of shower gel, lotion, deodorant, makeup removing towelettes and various other smaller bottles such as aspirin.  No matter where you put an item, you won't have to dig through the case to find it.  No one area is so deep as to lose something.This is a flat type case rather than a duffel bag shape.  After you pack your jean and T-Shirts, this case will lay flat like the jeans or shirts.  No need to pack around a box on one end of your suitcase.  If you are looking for a new toiletry bag, I would definitely give this one a try.", "I got a basket of gift items for my honeymoon as one of my wedding gifts from an Amazon buddy with this included.  First, it's a great gift because it's unisex being grey; so whether a husband or wife nabs it, it will be appreciated either way.  And it works well for either.The material is waterproof or water resistant...I tested this by spilling a bit of water purposefully inside of a pocket to see how the bag would react if shampoo or contact lens cleaner got squirted out by the baggage handlers going through my bag as seems to be their hobby when I travel.  The only part that leaked out was where I didn't close the zipper all the way. So it passed the test there.Although it's a nice size compact bag, when you open the middle section you'll find a metal hanger to allow you to hang it on a bar. But you'll also find a handle on the outside so you can carry it easily like a bag or keep it by the sink.Your large size items like full shampoo and conditioner bottles fit easily in the middle section while there are loads of pockets for other items in the side sections, including one I haven't seen in other travel bags: a tiny section for a toothbrush so it does not have to be stored next to your other items. This is in one of the top sections. You can put your toothbrush at the bottom and there is a flap that then can rest over it and you can put other toiletries like toothpaste, a comb, etc on top. Or you can put your toothbrush and toothpaste in the section below that, unzip the zipper and that top section expands to about 3 times its original size so you can put larger items in that small section such as lotions and brushes.Below the hanging metal loop is mesh storage for those small items where you need to see what you are reaching for.It's well thought out. I wouldn't change a thing.", "Up until now I've had two choices when it comes to toiletry bags. I have one from LL Bean that has a multitude of compartments, is well-made, and has several thoughtful design features. The problem, however, is that it is bulky. Even when it is not filled to capacity the thickness makes it  impossible to fit into a garment bag.The other option is a one-compartment bag that fits fine, but is horrible to use. Everything gets all mixed together, so I end up having shampoo-flavored toothpaste, and gunk all over my electric toothbrush and shaver.This bag, however, works great. It has multiple, independent compartments so I can put my shaver in one, toothpaste/brush/floss in another, shampoo in a third, and so on. Everything stays properly stowed, and if there's a leak in something, it's not contaminating anything other than a similar product.Best of all, it's thin. Even when I packed it for a 4-day trip, I had no problems fitting it into the inner pouch on my garment bag.The construction quality is not as good as my LL Bean model, especially with regard to the zippers and handle. But it seems sturdy enough for a decent life span.Highly recommend this if you're looking for a multi-compartment bag but don't want to bulk-up. The less than robust construction quality for the price charged makes this a 4.5 star product (rounded up to 5 since I so like how thin it is!).[The manufacturer provided me with the product for review]", "\"When I first saw this toiletry bag, I thought I'd hate it, but after using it for a weekend trip, I am completely in love with its design.  I hung the bag on the back of my hotel bathroom door using the interior hanger (although the top loop could be used instead), and I had all my toiletries within easy reach.  Even better, they stayed organized the entire time.I was skeptical at first that the bag could hold enough items for a longer trip, so I packed mostly full-size items for my weekend trip.  It fit a full-size bottle of contact lens solution, my glasses case, a full-size tube of toothpaste, my toothbrush, a soap dish, a 2\"\" round brush, a tube of moisturizer, small bottles of shampoo and conditioner, and all my cosmetics.  I had no problem zipping up the compartments.  In fact, I probably could have added more items.  As for packing the bag in a suitcase: my husband and I shared a carry-on bag for the weekend -- and the toiletry bag fit easily on top of one-half of the small suitcase.  Despite packing so many full-size containers, my toiletries seemed to take up less space than the cosmetic bag I usually pack.The bag is made of an industrial-gray nylon material with black nylon zippers. There are four main compartments, with a fifth inside the largest one.  The largest compartment and its sub-pouch use mesh to keep objects in place; the others do not.  When you unzip the largest compartment (in the middle), a hanger is revealed that allows you to hang the bag, with the compartment exposed, on a bathroom door, shower head, or closet rod.I have only two minor complaints:  I wish that the bag were more attractive (I would even go as far as saying that it's ugly), and I wish there were some kind of Velcro fastener to keep the bag folded in thirds when packed with smaller carry-on-size cosmetics.  Although it's great that it stores flat, sometimes I might want to keep it folded.  Neither of these criticisms is a big deal compared to the functionality of the bag; however, they would make me like it more.  Note:  The manufacturer sent me this item to give a honest review.This would make a great gift for a frequent traveler, although it's color/look might make it more appropriate for a man than a woman.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\"", "This is an elegant little bag for carrying everything you might need in the way of toiletries, keeping several items separate yet conveniently at hand. It hangs easily from the bathroom door and cuts down on the amount of space I, for one, usually clog up during any stay of longer than a day or so in transit. It lies flat in a suitcase, unlike other toiletry bags that make a tight fit - or even reduction in what you take with you. I was super-glad to have one during my international trip earlier this year; it certainly made things much easier when I reached my hotel, exhausted, and just wanted to relax; just unzip the bag, hang it on the door, and everything is right there for you!", "DavidsBeenHere's Travel Toiletry Bag is an excellent way to carry those necessities for living on the road.  Its five compartments permit segmentation of the items. Like many, we were used to stuffing everything into a boxy, plastic bag that never fits right into the suit case.  This travel bag spreads flatly on top of clothes, or in any layer of clothing, thereby distributing the volume for easy packing.  It has earned a permanent place in our packing routine.", "In our travels, my wife and I have found that newer hotels usually have larger bathrooms with ample space on the vanity for all our meds, toiletries, shaver, etc. That's often not the case, though, especially with older hostelries. For that reason, my wife, who travels with a lot more stuff than I do, always carries a fold-up hanging bag for her things.After examining the Davidsbeenhere bag, she claimed it for herself and gave me her old one, no discussion necessary. Nevertheless, I asked her why she preferred this bag over her old one, and she gave me her reasons:1. It's very lightweight, which matters on flying trips, where overweight bags cost plenty of extra fees. (I weighed it, and it came in at 8 ounces.)2. Folded up, it's very compact, but hung up on the back of a door or in a closet, it's surprisingly spacious, with more than enough room for most people's needs.3. It has enough separate compartments to separate different items into their own area (toothpaste and toothbrush, shampoo and conditioner, prescription meds, OTC meds, cosmetics, etc.4. The synthetic fabric and mesh are lightweight, but appear to be very tough and durable.5. The steel hanging hook is the right size for hanging on a doorknob or shower curtain rod, and it's securely sewn into a fabric-reinforced part of the bag.6. The carrying handle is big enough for just about anyone's hands, and it's securely sewn into the bag.So my wife is very happy to have a new toiletries bag that she loves, while I make do with her old one.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for an honest review.", "Davidsbeenhere clearly knows about travel when it comes to his products.  I don't know how I traveled without this cosmetics bag.  It conveniently keeps all your toiletries separate and fits nicely in a suitcase.  Hang it up in the back up a door and you can easily unzip what you need out of each compartment. Easy Breezy Access.  The material is lightweight, David Hoffman keeps the needs of the efficient and budget traveler in mind.", "Considering myself a road warrior and traveling frequently for both business and pleasure, I've used many travel products for all sorts of trips.  The Davidsbeenhere Hanging Travel Toiletry Bag has become one of my favorites.  Whether you fly or drive for travel, you will need to bring basic care needs, such as a razor, comb, toothbrush, and other personal care items.  For those who fly, this bag is no exception to the `Kippie' bag (the magic 311 liquids bag that supposedly keeps our skies safer) mandated by the TSA, however, for everything else that is not liquid, this item is great.  In carry-on luggage, it is fantastic because it lays flat and keeps everything organized in one layer allowing you extra space to pack more.The Hanging Travel Toiletry Bag has four main compartments giving you plenty of space for storing things.  Its measured compartments from left to right include: the first zip pocket at 4 in. width by 10 in. height by 2.5 in. depth; a center main pocket at 7.5 in. width by 10 in. height by 2.5 in. depth;  a smaller zip pocket with 2.5 in. width by 10 in. height by 2.5 in. depth;  and lastly, on the far right is a zip pocket with 1 in. width by 10 in. height by 2.5 in. depth that can be extended like an expandable suit case giving up to 2.5 in. in width of storage space.  The zip open lid of the center compartment has a zip pocket space of 10.5 in. height by 5 in. width.  These measurements are approximate, taken when first getting the bag out of the package and before any use that may help stretch it further.The bag itself is made of a very tough, durable material.  The zippers appear very strong and durable as well.  It also has a good amount of give, so you can squeeze in items that you may not normally be able to fit in more ridged, inflexible bags.Even for those who don't travel, the Davidsbeenhere Hanging Travel Toiletry Bag would also be great for keeping your toiletry items organized in your gym bag for use after workouts.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the vendor for the purposes of providing this review. A review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.", "This is the second travel toiletry bag I have ever used. My MIL bought me one from LL Bean a couple of years ago and I used it but wasn't overly happy with it.  I was on a trip yesterday and used this bag to try it out, I used it for 2 people and it fit everything we needed.  I like how there are the 4 compartments and when you lay it out you can easily see everything.  I didn't use the hook to hang it up, just laid it on the counter in the bathroom.  It works fine, I mean it is a toiletry bag, nothing exciting.  I like it and will keep using it, it fits easily into my bigger bag and keeps everything together.  If something leaked at least it would be confined to this bag and not get all over everything else in my big bag.", "This is a pretty neat toiletry bag. Neat in terms of usefulness, not neatness.The good. The bag packs flat so you save on space and bulk when packing. No longer will you need to find a big chunk of Space to fit your toiletry bag. You can fit a lot of stuff inside. I can even fit my small straightening iron, an item that I always just put loose in my luggage. The bag expands on one side in case you need more space. It also has a hook so you can hang it and make it more functional.The bad. You can't see where anything is. Except for the front pocket, which is made out of mesh, everything is in a closed zipper. Therefore, you will be looking around for your stuff If you do not remember where you put it. More stand alone compartments or holders would have been good.The ugly. This was not designed with a woman in mind. The bag looks like it was designed for men. I wish there were other color options (red? Purple?). It also looks so...manly. I know this is a stupid thing to complain about but, we, women, want our stuff to be both functional and nice to look at.This item has been provided for free by davidsbeenhere for the purposes of a review.", "\"This unusually shaped toiletry bag is flatter, wider, and accommodates larger containers than most such bags.Like most regular travelers, I have a pre-packed toiletry kit that I use for travel so I'm not packing/unpacking my entire personal-care setup every trip.  But, my rugged old kit has several drawbacks, including being very thick when loaded, the large \"\"general purpose\"\" pockets get jumbled full of small items, and I have to carry separate ziplock bags for the larger containers that I do pack/unpack every trip.This bag eliminates my ziplock clutter by having enough space in its vertical pockets for all the taller containers, the separate pockets helping to segregate my clutter, with the center having two mesh pockets (one zippered) for smaller items.  As a bonus, the pockets are shaped such that these large items don't fall out even when the bag is hung from the captive hook in the center compartment.The thin design lets this bag take up the \"\"outside\"\" of your suitcase, lying flat across your other items (there's usually some slack left there when I pack, so would be \"\"wasted space\"\" otherwise).  While the bag is large for a toiletry kit, it still fits narrow-ways across either of my 28-inch \"\"pullman\"\" suitcases.This bag is well-designed, and its design fills a niche in my packing needs.  Recommended.\"", "I was given the opportunity to try out and review the Davidsbeenhere Hanging Travel Toiletry Cosmetics Bag Kit. Normally when I'm on a trip, I end up tossing all my stuff (like toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, meds, etc) into the mesh/zippered area of my suitcase, and then I sort it all out when I get there. I don't have enough stuff to justify (or fill up) the bulkiness of a cube-like toiletry kit, but it's a pain to have my stuff all over the place. This travel bag solves all that.The design is nice, in that it's long and flat. I can lay it out across the top of my packed stuff, and it doesn't take up much space. The center area has a mesh pouch area for the stuff that might be more loose, and the flap for the center section has a hook which makes storage in the bathroom of my travel destination much more convenient than having to unpack everything. The side compartments are spacious and sized well for the type of stuff I might want to put there. From a &#34;guy perspective&#34;, the gray coloring and look of the bag isn't such that you hope no one sees you with it, or asks you if you had your wife's permission to take her cosmetic bag.In short, this is a great product with a perfect design for my needs. It's made the &#34;must use&#34; list of things I take with me when I leave the house on a trip.Disclosure:Obtained From: CompanyPayment: Free", "The toiletry bag we currently own is useless. It's got one huge space where everything gets lost in the bottom. I hate using it; it's really no better than putting all of our toiletries in a plastic grocery bag and hoping for the best. David's Been Here impressed me with their hanging travel toiletry/cosmetics bag. Everything has its place in this bag. There's a separate zippered are on the size that fits my Sonic toothbrush perfectly. There's a hook that allows you to hang the toiletry bag in between uses, and the mesh pockets make sure that everything stays in their place.Imagine a life where you don't have to rifle through a toiletry bag to find the dental floss that's sunk to the bottom. A world where your lipstick hasn't been jostled by other items so that the lid fell off and now there's lipstick everywhere. That's that the DBH toiletry bag does.
