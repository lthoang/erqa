They even send it in a beautiful brown gift bag - a nice extra touch if you're thinking of giving it to someone for a gift.It's beautiful, high quality leather with a vintage feel and look to it.The iPad fits perfectly and snugly and the on/off feature (close the case - device off - open the case - device on) works exactly as advertised.I couldn't decide between this or the curve model, but I love the laces on the binding and the more vintage look.If you're wondering about the quality and look of this case - wonder no more.  I'm a tough (but fair) critic and you're going to love this case.", "Very nice case for the iPad Air. Quality was first and foremost on the minds of the manufacturer. Head and shoulders above the Apple leather case. Well done Bear Motion.", "I ordered this ipad cover for myself on a holiday deal last month. I did not note the orange stitching at the time of my order and was really surprised when the case arrived. The case itself seemed very nice, the leather was very smooth and the quilting was evenly done. But the large orange stitching made the whole thing look pretty tacky.Back it went!", "This iPad case lives up to it's reviews. I first bought a &#34;vegan leather&#34; case for my iPad but the heft and feel just wasn't right. Not to mention the case was cut so close a minor iPad shift would cover a smidge of the screen....no biggie, just didn't like it. Then I noticed Bear Motion's Luxury case (with a free promotional touch pen/ink pen that is great!). I figured the iPad will be my companion for at least a couple years so why not feel as good about the case as the product it houses? Love the case! Inside it has a wide cut for the screen but still holds the iPad firmly. Also, plenty of room for the charging connector on the side (too tight on old case) for easy hookup. It has nice heft and that wonderful feel of good leather. I apologize to the critter who donated it's &#34;case&#34; in the making of this product but it does live on and is respected and appreciated. Between this case and the wonderful capacity(?) pen included for free I'm really starting to like these Bear Motion guys!", "The &#8220;Bear Motion Case for Apple iPad Air (Curve Black/Red)&#8221; is a beautiful, well-constructed cover for your iPad Air.  The buffalo hide leather &#8211; according to the product description genuine cowhide - is smooth and luxurious; its feel is similar to that of the cover on an old, well-used Bible.  All edges and seams are nicely finished; stitching is even and smooth.  The red is close to the product description photo; it is not a vivid primary red, but a more subdued brick red color.The iPad Air fits snugly in the black buffalo hide leather frame; a buffalo hide leather strap tucks in behind the iPad Air and holds the device securely.  A magnet closure keeps the cover from opening accidentally; it also puts your iPad Air in a sleep mode when the cover is closed.As long as you are not an individual who handles your electronic devices roughly, the &#8220;Bear Motion Case for Apple iPad Air (Curve Black/Red)&#8221; provides reasonable protection for your iPad Air.  It may not provide protection if you drop your iPad Air on a concrete surface or throw it across the room.  It does add about 8 oz. to the weight of your iPad Air.If you are someone who is tired of black, uninspired covers for your electronic devices, you may want to consider the &#8220;Bear Motion Case for Apple iPad Air (Curve Black/Red)&#8221;.  It is beautiful, functional, and &#8211; for buffalo hide leather - reasonably priced.  I love the &#8220;Bear Motion Case for Apple iPad Air (Curve Black/Red)&#8221; and think you will, too.", "I have bought many cases for the several iPads that I own and this one is by far the most beautiful one. I would not buy this case for a child or for any heavy field usage such as carpentry, farming or mechanical work on vehicles because the grease and soil will be hard to remove. For that kind of work I use the Otter defender.However, for office work and work in the airline cockpit, this case is great. It looks very professional and the workmanship is second to none.This case is made of thick genuine leather that was thoughtfully crafted. Yes, I have accidentally dropped the iPad Air with this case from my dinning table to a hard floor and the unit was protected. However, I do not believe that this case case could provide protection to the unit if the iPad was deliberately thrown through a flight of stairs.This is a product is very well manufactured.", "We've tested several different covers including the Snugg, AYL, and Yoobao, in addition to other retail (belkin...) covers.  I was really excited after reading the reviews, which may have raised my expectations too high.In its favor, the leather is beyond spectacular.  It's amazing quality leather, soft and durable and goes way beyond any of the other covers.  If this was just about the leather, we would have definitely kept this cover.Unfortunately, it's design is more cumbersome than the fold behind covers, and its bulk and shape prevent the magnets from making contact, and enabling the auto sleep feature.  Worse, you can hear the ipad clicking on and off randomly, as the magnet comes just close enough to trigger and un-trigger the sleep magnet on the iPad.  We generally preferred the fold back covers which allow the iPad to stand easier, or be flipped for better typing/work angle.  Also, this design adds an extra layer of fabric/reinforcement/stitching which makes the slim iPad2/3 in this case much thicker than our old iPad 1 with what we thought was a thick AYL Case.Style wise, if it weren't for the football laces this would be the absolute best looking cover in the world.  With the stitches, however, it looks like something that you'd find in a mail order ad in boys life, or in a rich child's playroom in an old-timey Connecticut mansion.We much preferred the Snugg cover despite not having nearly as nice of a leather finish on the outside.  Even better, we could get two of any other cover we tried for the price of this one Bear Motion.", "Very nice Construction, It comes with a very nice bag.  It smells like real leather as opposed to the other ones that smell like a new car.  If you're looking for a cover that looks old Timey this is the way to go.", "This is the one to use to pack your ipad air (or mini, for which I also have the Bear case).  The much more expensive apple case is great for around the house or office, but if you want to put your pad in a backpack, suitcase, or take in on public transportation, then you need the additional protection the Bear provides.....and it looks good too.  It comes with a thick velvet bag that the pad with case on it can slide into for even more protection when not in use.  A very fine product, well made, perfect fit, and luxurious feel and appearance for a very fair price.  I'm very happy with one I have on my mini, and gave the larger air-size one for a gift.", "This cover for the Ipad is classy, well-made and uniquely different from the run of the mill covers available.  It is well made and works perfectly.  I love it.", "My employer supplied me with an iPad about this time last year.  They included one of the apple silicone back segmented metal front cases.  It was ok but not very stable.  Tried one of the targus cases but the lack of auto shutoff was always a bit of a pain.  The plastic back developed a crack in the corner and would not retain the iPad reliably any longer so I purchased this case.  The Bear Motion looks and feels great and I could not be happier.  The auto shutoff feature works like a champ and the unit it plenty stable.  I would buy again in a heartbeat!", "Wanted an alternative to the pricey OEM cover.  Not much of a fan of the new origami style so I tried this Bear Motion case.  Outstanding product.  Magnetic on-off works perfectly as does the multi-angle screen recliner.  Very pleased with this case.  Highly recommend.", "Got my case quickly and it smells fantastic. Love the vintage football &#34;look&#34; to the case. Fortunately I throw like Chad Pennington, so my iPad is in no danger of getting damaged regardless of what the case looks like.The case has 3 strips sewn into the case to give one 3 different viewing angles if watching in landscape mode. For portrait viewing, the flap easily folds behind and it fits well in the hand. The case is light weight and does not burden the device. I love the fact my dad asked if it was $100 - it looks the part, folks.Not to sound corny, but I love the &#34;USA&#34; part of it too. The fact you can get a very well made case that's not from China for a not-unreasonable price makes me feel all the better about the purchase. Great job Bear Motion! Two thumbs up from me!", "When I bought an iPad Air, the first accessory I thought about was the cover.  I wanted something nice that protected the tablet but was not too bulky.  The usual options found at Apple or other stores were serviceable but not special.  Until this new cover arrived, I used one that I had bought for my old iPad.  The old cover did the job but all of the buttons were obscured.  Also the cover was stiff and felt more like leatherette-covered cardboard.The Bear Motion cover is truly luxurious.  It's exactly what I wanted.  I bought the brown with black.  It reminds me of a baseball glove.  I especially like how the stand is engineered, via three sewn-on strips of leather to tilt the tablet at the desired angle.  It really feels like a nice leather accessory.  The case has a magnetic closure.  Generally I don't like to have magnets around my electronics, but this is a relatively gentle magnet and I don't mind it at all.  This is the first case I have ever had that turns on the iPad when I open the cover and turns it off when closed (something to do with the magnet, I suppose).  All of the buttons on the edges of the device are easy to access.  The cover provides plenty of protection, looks and feels great, and does not take up a lot of space.  It will work equally well for travel and home use.This is a great purchase and makes me love the new iPad Air just that much more.", "While Apple has moved towards clever covers that are low profile, this Bear Motion cover is a bit of a throwback.  It feels and looks nostaligic.  The materials, construction and ergonomics translate as authentic and real...certainly quality.  If you do a lot of reading with your ipad this is a highly recommended cover as it actually comes the closest to feeling like your reading a book.  It is also easy to access your iPad for cleaning and then put back in - something not insignificant with a touch screen that needs cleaning often.I've used a number of different covers spanning a few iPads and this one is easily my favorite.", "\"Judging by the 5/5 star review, you'd think this case is perfect. Unfortunately, that is not the case (no pun intended). The outer leather is nice and soft, however the \"\"leather\"\" that goes around the iPad screen is cheap looking with glue or something like that holding it together. Also, the home screen button DOES NOT fit centered in the cut out for it. It is almost halfway covered. This can somewhat be seen in their provided photos, but it's even worse on mine.  The home screen button misalignment is the main reason I'm taking 1 star away from this product.  I feel like designing it to be centered in the cutout wouldn't be that difficult. All in all, this is a good case and you get real leather (at least on the outside) for the same price as Apple's case/cover.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.11493056267499924, 0.0016640403773635626, 0.02819269709289074, 0.037662774324417114, 0.0655476301908493, 0.15265566110610962, 0.02548372931778431, 0.12648655474185944, 0.005085004959255457, 0.15143659710884094, 0.12038666009902954, 0.0002647048677317798, 0.11681908369064331, 0.00018648857076186687, 0.046977829188108444, 0.006219937466084957]]}
