The Monster Digital 240 GB Daytona Series drive has proven to be a wonderful upgrade.  Installation was a piece of cake, popped out the old drive and popped the new one in.  The laptop recognized it with no problems, and I was able to load up my OS with no problems as well.  Bootup times and performance of the laptop has been noticeably improved.  I'm usually plugged in so I haven't been able to test the battery usage claims.  I'm thrilled with the ease, and performance of this drive, and have no complaints.", "\"My MacBook Pro is over four years old now, and lately it seems much slower. The Multi-colored spinning beach ball keeps constantly appearing, making me wait. Even though the S.M.A.R.T. status still shows the drive as good, I had a hunch it needed replacing.The replacement - Monster Digital's 240 GB Daytona Series 2.5 \"\" Solid State Hard Drive. It has a Three Year Limited Warranty, 550/515 Read/Write Speed, is SATA 2/3 Compliant, 256-bit AES Security, and an Ultra-Slim 7mm Universal Fit. It sounds perfect to me. My current drive in the MacBook Pro is a Hitachi 5400 RPM 320 GB, so I would lose a little bit of storage at the expense of gaining speed. A compromise I was willing to settle for, besides, I have a one terabyte portable USB 3.0 Seagate Expansion drive if I need extra space.Monster Digital ships the drive in a cardboard box that has a well padded felt molded inner tray, which the drive fits in. There is a rubber- like cover over the tray, and when lifted off, it exposes the Daytona Series drive. I found the box and presentation of the drive to be very slick, not to mention the glossy black drive itself.  The Daytona Series is second from Monster Digital's top of the line LeMans series. The drive does not come pre-formatted or partitioned, so it makes things easier to restore a cloned drive, and also saves time removing one format to replace it with another one. The Daytona SSD is basically compatible with anything - Windows 2000 Pro, XP, Vista, 7 (hmm it does not mention 8 - but I don't think it was out at the time I got the drive), Macbook, or Macbook Pro with an Intel processor running Mac OS X 10.1 or higher, or a Mac Mini, any Linux OS.Installation of Monster Digital's 240 GB Daytona Series SSD was a breeze. Since I was using this drive as a replacement, I first needed to clone my old 320 GB Hitachi drive to an external USB drive using Carbon Copy Cloner for Mac, which took about two and half hours. My Hitachi drive only had about 160 GB stored on it so, depending on the amount of data it could take a shorter or longer time. Keep in mind the amount of data copied needs to be LESS than the capacity of the drive it is being transferred to. Cloning the drive and then copying the clone to the new drive once it is installed is the longest process in the replacement. The actual drive transfer only took about five minutes and was so simple. I recommend looking at Apple's (or your computer manufacturer's) user manual to become familiar with the steps. I printed mine out just in case.  Apple said it was \"\"important\"\" to put the mounting screws on the sides of the new drive, and to use the screws on the existing drive if the new drive does not come with any. The Monster Digital Daytona did not come with these screws, so off they came from the Hitachi drive. Wait, what kind of funky screws are those? It turns out to be Torx screws. I needed to run to Home Depot and get a precision Torx driver for like six dollars.  Since this is a solid state drive, it probably was not necessary to mount those screws, since it seemed to fit pretty solid without them, but I wanted to do this right, and Apple emphasized it was important so the screws are in place.Once the Hitachi was removed and the Daytona was in place, the restoration process takes awhile. I used a USB flash drive to put a bootable copy of disc utility to copy the image of the drive stored on the external USB drive.  One word of note, if there is a Boot Camp partition on the Mac's drive, that needs to be cloned and restored separately using a windows cloning program. I actually wanted a fresh install of Windows, since it was running extremely slow, so I only backed up important files to restore later. As mentioned before it took a few hours to restore the image, but once it was done I restarted my MacBook Pro and immediately noticed a big difference.I timed some measurements of the boot sequence before I swapped out the drive for comparison purposes. Here is what I got:Time until initial\"\"Apple\"\" appears:Hitachi 320 GB Drive: 17 sec.Daytona 240 GB SSD: 15 sec.Time Until Log InScreen Appears:Hitachi 320 GB Drive: 1 min. 28 sec.Daytona 240 GB SSD: 38 sec.Time From Log InScreen Until DockAppears:Hitachi 320 GB Drive: 1 min. 38 sec.Daytona 240 GB SSD: 9 sec.As you can see, the boot up time has been cut dramatically by the Daytona SSD. The computer is running like it is brand new again. I rarely see the spinning beach ball anymore, and EVERY application runs smoother and faster. Shut down time is also much less. I forgot to time that before the switch, but now it can literally only be a few seconds to about twenty, depending on what was opened and needs to be cleaned from the cache I guess. This drive has effectively extended the life of my MacBook Pro by speeding it up like it did. I highly recommend it, The spinning multi-colored beach balls were cute, but I like my MacBook Pro much better without them.UPDATE: For some reason, the Daytona series is no longer listed on Monster Digital's website, only the LeMans series. I'm not sure what is going on with that. There is also a note that there was a bad run on some of the 120 GB drives, which would account for so many negative reviews on those. My 240 GB is running fine, I like it a lot.\"", "I bought this to replace an older-generation SSD that crashed without warning a few months back.  I'm far from expert on hardware installation, but I found that step pretty simple and I'm sure that 95% of users would find the same.I've had this in my netbook for a while now, but wanted to wait so I could have time to properly assess performance.  So far I have found it far faster than the previous SSD with excellent write times, and I have had no lags or crashes.  I admit to being nervous given my previous experience with an SSD, but to this point things have been great.  Given the price and performance, I'd recommend this one without reservation.", "I like most others who have used this product am very pleased with it. This is for any one looking to spead things up on their computer. That is the reason for this product I know so it should work but any one who as used a computer knows not all work. I am glad to say that this one indeed does. Also just as good is the easy to install instructions and such. It does not take long at all. I do recommend this.", "You need an adapter to program it, but it didn't come with an adapter. So we bought one at Walmart that is similar, but the software was lacking.  It  would be nice if they sold their adapter and software as separate items, but they don't sell the adapter by itself.  It runs pretty well though.  It's fast.", "i'm so used to working with computers from a decade ago, that I don't look around to see what could make it a tad more efficient.  so I discovered the advantages of a solid state drive just as I was forced to upgrade my 6 year old computer.  SATA6 brings the current corp of solid state drives into its own best of league bootup capabilities.  i'm so used to installing a single drive for everything, that using one drive solely for the operating system was not a consideration until the obvious need for specialization became apparent with the relatively modest (unless you really, really want to spend bucks) size of solid state drives.  now, of course, it makes sense and the results are simply lovely.", "I installed this into a Toshiba laptop and installation was really simple. There are videos on Youtube from Monster that show you exactly how to pop one of these into your laptop. All you need is a small screwdriver and you are set.You do need to reinstall your Operating System and have a way to transfer anything from your old drive onto the new one. Pretty obvious and quite simple to do. Monster has videos showing you how to do this yourself as well.I've seen a definite improvement in read/write speeds using Fedora Linux. Using it for approximately 2 months has shown no reduction in performance. Highly recommended!", "EDIT TUES 2/11/14:When we installed this hard drive initially in to our computer, it performed exceptionally, but... 6months later it completely died!  The good thing about it was that once we got a hold of a technician and we trouble shot, they were extremely quick to replace it.  The few months that it sat in my hubby's comp before I spilled water on it and fried the mother board...  It worked great!!!  Seriously, I really did do that.  :(After that comp got fried, we bought a 2006 Macbook Pro, and was told the harddrive was compatible with macs, well we were not told we needed a firmware update so then we had to take it back out put the old drive back in because the macbook crashed and then get a hold of Monster again.After telling them either they send us a new drive or give us the firmware because the link they sent us was dead, they sent it to us and we installed it after re-installing the hard drive.  It once again crashed, we took it out yet again and put the old one back in, dreading contacting Monster again.  :(When we finally got around to contacting them, we asked them to send us a Mac specific solid state drive equivalent to the one we had and they complied happily actually.  :)  It was worked swell ever since for a couple months.So bottom-line: when it comes to Monster drives, they are, unfortunately, hit or miss, HOWEVER the company is more than happy to make sure you do, eventually, get a drive that actually works properly!  Thankfully they have pretty good customer service and tech support, though they may take some time to get a hold of, just be persistent, they will asnwer and help you.I suppose if I could go back in time, I may not have got this drive knowing the trouble it caused, but we are quite happy with what we have now.  :DORIGINAL REVIEW:I am not exactly a computer person, however, my husband is...  So I got this with him in mind, for his computer (we each have our own computers), at which he was elated!  It was good and bad, since he was having computer issues, so he had a fine time setting it up, but once he did he was very impressed.This was our first solid state hard drive, and we like it, it runs so much faster, not to mention booting instantly.  So, for my technologically impaired mind, I think it is really great!  :D  If you want technical aspects...  Sorry, you'll have to read a review from someone who knows the jargon.God Bless ~Amy", "I was given the opportunity to review this hard drive.  Frankly, I was not very familiar with a sold state hard drive, not with Monster as a brand for producing hard drives.This product was easy to install in my laptop.  I was able to clone the older hard drive and basically swapped this drive.Pros:1. Speed:  I can notice the difference in processing speeds from an older conventional hard drive.  It does seem that this computer is able to open programs much faster than before.2. Use:  The big advantage for a solid-state hard drive is the fact that there are essentially no moving-parts.  Thus, this type of drive is more immune from drops and stirs during use.  I have been using this drive for a few months and have had no issues with durability to this point.3. Heat:  As this drive requires less electrical input, it does seem as though the computer is drawing less power and using less battery (plus I upgraded from terrible Vista to far better Windows 7).Cons:1.  Transfer to new hard drive:  Huge pain and not directly the fault of the drive, but not easy.  Something to consider if this is an upgrade.Neutral:1.  Cost:  With the many inexpensive laptops available, the cost component is a significant consideration since this is likely an upgrade for the user. However, based on my use, it is certainly worth a serious consideration given the advantages of solid-state technology and the comfort of knowing that the hard drive is more robust and faster than before.Overall:This seems like a good product and is well worth considering as an upgrade.  Solid-state is less prone to failure and that is a huge selling point.  The model I received is a 240GB model, which is probably sufficient for most users.", "I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. I ordered this drive for my son who built our family PC on a budget with a limited hard drive. This is his feedback...The Solid State Drive is amazingly fast. This is my first SSD and I have absolutely no complaints about it. After formatting the drive, my first test was to transfer a 700MB file onto it. It did so in a matter of seconds. As I understand it, SSDs have shorter lifespans than the older platter-based hard drives, but so far it's been holding up nicely. After transferring a couple items to see how fast the write speeds were, I decided to set it as my primary drive and see how fast it would be in terms of booting up and shutting down. The results are phenomenal. Relative to the older hard drives, SSDs are a amazingly faster. Even with some of the bloat ware I've purposely installed, the start up time has not diminished.  I give this product a 5 star review.", "\"I use this drive as a startup disk for an iMac running Mountain Lion. I thought about installing it internally, but the various self-help videos available on the Internet convinced me that was far behind my skills. Instead I connected the drive to the computer with aSeagate GoFlex Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE121)and a thunderbolt cable. (The Seagate page says you can only use it with other Seagate drives, but that's obviously not true.)Disregard the advertised 500 MB/s read/write speeds; those are theoretical and never seen in real life. I get about 210 MB/s read, and 240 MB/s write. In comparison, the internal 7200 rpm hard drive that came with the iMac (affectionately renamed \"\"Spinny\"\") gives me about 100 MB/s read and write speed.Applications open VERY quickly, and seem far faster than the 2.4x speed test results would suggest. My computer starts up in 10 seconds. I'm very happy -- it's like getting a brand new computer.\"", "Putting the test of time aside this seems to be a commendable drive.  Given the cost prohibitive nature of SSDs over the past few years I unfortunately can't compare it apples to apples with other SSDs at length, at least not with first hand experience, but I have so far experienced markedly improved read/write speeds compared to my current 250gb Seagate Barracuda and more or less the same speeds as my current 60gb SSD.  With the prices of SSDs dropping below the $1.00/gb I would certainly start recommending them as a more routine inclusion for pedestrian use.  Particularly to any folks having bad luck with mechanical failed drives which is always frustrating."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00043898317380808294, 0.009985712356865406, 0.02529231458902359, 0.3544773757457733, 0.21957284212112427, 0.006693155039101839, 0.0034325814340263605, 0.0011028260923922062, 0.24320989847183228, 0.13396520912647247, 0.0007817199220880866, 0.0010473730508238077]]}
