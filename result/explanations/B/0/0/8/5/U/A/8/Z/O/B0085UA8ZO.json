"], "reviews": ["I have had this for a few months now and wanted to review it later to see how much my daughter played with it.The table is aimed for 6+ months to 36 Months. I have had it since she was 22 months, she recently turned 2. Assembly was probably the easiest toy yet! All you have to do is snap in the legs and you are done! No tools are needed.When I placed it on the floor my daughter sat down at it like it was a table, well, it is. She had so much fun! The weeks that followed she played with it in the afternoons. It seems there is so much to do that I found my daughter was not bored easily but rather engaged. I store it in her toy closet and she will pull it out and put it away on her own. There is a `fake' microphone that does not stay in place well and she does not use it with this toy. She has brought the microphone out and uses it when her favorite children's videos are on and pretends to sing to them with it. It was perfect; I was looking for a fake microphone and ended up using the one with the toy so it worked out well.Playskool is not a brand I buy a lot but lately they have released a few great toys. They are getting up there with their competition. I think the fake piano is my daughter's favorite part. She likes to play it with her videos like she is playing with the band on TV.Very impressed and think my daughter will still be using this a year from now. It has held up well. I like that this can be used without the legs for younger children who can't stand yet, that is a brilliant idea. This toy is a winner in this home.", "\"We have had this for at least 4 months and during these 4 months my daughter has played with this toy on almost a daily basis.She first started out without the legs attached since it can be used as a floor toy. Once she got her stability standing we attached the legs and she stands before it pressing and spinning for the sounds. She loves listening to the music and enjoys her own form of dancing which is usually bopping her head along to the music. Each action in the music mode adds special sound effects to the music being played almost making her, her very own DJ.Its a fun education toy that's also bilingual. There's a spanish mode on there as well that teaches basics color (red, green, yellow), numbers (1,2,3) and alphabet A,B,C).I'm definitely going to have to give this toy 5 stars. Usually by now this toy would have been placed to the side and forgotten about but she loves it. If you have a baby that loves music then this definitely is the toy for you.Edited: 21 May 2013My daughter is almost 16 months and she still plays with this, though not on a daily basis anymore. She loves when the song \"\"I love to move it, move it\"\" comes on. She dances to it and finds it hilarious. It's one of the only toy she's had for more than 6 months that has kept its replay value. It has truly earned its 5 stars in our book!\"", "The Rocktivity Music Skool Table is absorbing to my daughter, and it is great that it is helping her with her standing and coordination! Sometimes when she is playing a song on it, she will let go of the table and dance, which is wonderful! At first, she didn't seem to realy 'get' the different buttons and effects, but after a week or so with the toy, it is one of her favorite things to go straight to to play with. The acoustic song choices are a little limited, but good- ABC (the Jacksons version), Twist and Shout, and some other child-friendly classics come up, but my favorite part about it is that she can create her own music by combining the different options. I also like the counting on the drum feature, she seems to be gaining an understanding about the numbers and that they come in sequence.This is really a great and seemingly fun toy for her, and I would definitely recommend it as a good choice for a kind of tricky age to find something fun but not too childish, that will also encourage standing and balance!", "We had a music table for our eldest daughter back when she was a year and she loved it.  I didn't care for it too much, mainly because I didn't think it was that cool.  It didn't have that many features, and the ones that it had were generic to me.  While out youngest daughter is somewhat past the stage of using these tables for the purpose of standing and learning basic motor skills, she is still barely two and we have a slew of friends with kids between the ages of 6 months to 2 years of age, so we felt like upgrading our `table' would be a good idea.Was it ever!This Rocktivity Table is a blast, and the kids (ours and theirs) love it.  It has enough musical variety to keep them entertained for a substantial amount of time, and when you get more than two or three playing with it they can entertain themselves for a long time.  The learning portion of the table isn't really any different than the other more generic tables, but it has enough going for it to balance out that issue.  I actually like the musical choices.  My kids listen to the radio with me, so they were excited to recognize songs from popular artists.  I also loved that this was a synch to put together, and it is actually durable enough to stay together despite the abuse it receives (toddlers love to climb all over things).  With a guitar, microphone and piano to play with and some neat musical features (like the DJ sounds), this is a unique twist on the table toy.", "This is a welcome addition to any family room to keep your growing baby busy. The sounds, activities, and music will keep their curiosity peaked and hopefully help them start to develop their musical intelligence. Like most kids toys you're going to have spend the time putting it together and installing the batteries and tearing through the cardboard box, but I can definitely recommend it for those over 3 months.", "\"This particular table style toy is really cute, I like the music theme with familiar rock songs (redone in a generic style), and it has some educational elements with numbers, opposites and Spanish thrown in.  I don't really see this as much of an educational toy though (Leap Frog does way more hard core educational stuff in my opinion, but mom and dad are the best teachers quite honestly - not toys).  I just see this as a fun toy that any toddler would love to have.  The educational elements they tout are just fluff really.  Don't buy this thinking it's going to make an educational impact.  It may help your young one appreciate music though - who knows.My only complaint is the microphone which is detachable... is detachable.  That means it can easily be lost.  When you remove the microphone it changes the \"\"play mode\"\" so losing it would mean that you lose some of the functionality of the toy.\"", "\"My youngest little one (his privacy is protected) adores this. He is almost a year old. His expression is priceless as he plays, standing, at the table. Although he has been practicing \"\"race-crawling\"\" lately, this stopped him right in his tracks! The Playschool Rocktivity Music School Table kept him occupied and beaming for ages! He is not yet walking, but crawling is good for children, the latest reports say. He is, however, able to pull himself up, and this is a great toy for him to stand at. It will strengthen his legs at this age, for later walking. There are so many things to do when you are playing with this toy, and the music, and other audio learning aspects are GREAT fun, as welll as the colors and activities! Rock on!I love this and recommend it 100 percent!\"", "Our 1 year old son has SUCH a great time.  This is definitely his go-to toy.  He loves to lean on it, and it helps him stand.  His favorite songs are definitely ABC and Twist and Shout.  He always giggles and seems to dance to it.  The learning mode is especially cool as it teaches him letters, numbers, and colors.  I would definitely say this is a must-have for any new parent. :)", "The Playskool Roctivity Table has been a hit with our 9 month old ever since I pulled it out of the box.  Set up for this fun toy was a snap.  It took less than two minutes to free the table from the manufacturer's packaging and attach the legs for the table.The table appears to be big fun not just for our baby, but also for her two older sisters (7 and 10).  Her big sisters have been having a blast helping their little sister rock out with this activity table.  The baby has just been having a good time pressing buttons and pulling herself up to standing at the table.  By far, her favorite aspect of the toy is the removable microphone rattle toy.The table seems pretty sturdy and is certainly stable enough to support a baby who is pulling herself up on it.  There are several buttons on the table that produce musical sounds or sound effects.  I take issue with the claim that says there are over 50 musical tunes.  There are four or five actual songs, and many other sound elements, but not songs.  After an hour of my kids playing with this toy I was going a little batty hearing the same songs over and over again.  I think the way Playskool markets the item as having over 50 tunes and so on is misleading.  I spent a little while fiddling around with the table thinking that perhaps ours was in a demo mode or something of that nature, but there is no such switch on the toy, so I assume that can't be the case.Overall, it's not a bad toy, but I think if you are looking for more variety, it might be worth looking into the Leap Frog Learn and Groove Musical table.  I've played with that table at many friends' houses over the years and that one seems to offer more variety and educational value than this one.", "We did not attach the legs so our toddler could carry it around with him.  He just loves it, there are lots of buttons to hit, handles to pull, knobs to turn.  It trully is a fun toy. The price is not too awful and then as he gets taller we can attach the legs for even more enjoyment.  I highly recommend this product and hope you will enjoy it too.", "\"From the moment I took this out of the box, my 14-month-old has been going crazy for this toy.  I could barely get it out of the box before he was after me to finish putting it together (which took about 3 min).  The first thing he does each morning is run over to the table and start playing.So far what I like:-it entertains him for more than 5 min.  He doesn't get bored with it easily like some other toys.-I'm not completely irritated by the same song over and over.  It doesn't have tons of songs like it claims, but enough variety that I don't have the music stuck in my head like other toys.-He has figured out lots of things and even seems to have started saying \"\"one, two\"\" after pushing the counting button enough.What I'm not sure about:-some of the music choices.  Some of the music is very recent (like J.Lo's recent hit) and that is just odd to me.-he can switch the mode himself and will sometimes just switch back and forth between \"\"rock\"\" and \"\"learn,\"\" but doesn't quite understand what it is doing yet, so he is frustrated when it doesn't play the music.What I would like changed a bit:-It moves too easily.  My son slides this thing all over the place.  I would like if the legs had a little more grip on them (we have hardwood floors) so it would stay in one place instead of being pushed all around the house.Overall, I think this is a great toy!  My son will get plenty of enjoyment out of it for many more months (or years) and when the next two arrive in a few months, I can start using it with them at a few months of age.\"", "My one year old loves the Rocktivity table. She has a ton of fun playing and listening to it. I like it for her, also. She loves to play hard, but normally for 5 or 10 minutes at a time. The Rocktivity solves this problem! She will sit and play with it for a good 20 to 30 minutes, if not more. It's also easy to swap between learn and play modes. That's good, because you can give it a switch up and not hear the same thing over and over. This is on of my favorite toys for my baby! I love it and would highly recommend it to other parents!", "\"The Rocktivity Music Table is FUN! While the Rocktivity Music Skool Table comes with the option to be used without the legs, our 8 month old son loves to pull himself up to play with it. Be warned - the legs are extremely wobbly and probably weren't meant to be used as an object for baby to pull himself up with. Yep, he's toppled it over.  Yep, it fell on him but weighing about 6 lbs, he barely noticed. We've since secured the table anyways.The Rocktivity Music Skool Table plays in English AND Spanish to thoroughly confuse your child as he starts grasping language- hooray! \"\"Wait... you mean to tell me that all this time... I've been learning two different languages???\"\" Still a cool option though.Did I mention that the Rocktivity Music Skool Table comes with turn tables? Oh yes, friends. Yes. Turn- Fer-reaking Tables. I thoroughly tested them out. I mean, my son tested them out.  They work well.The Rocktivity Music Skool Table teaches the basics- numbers, colors and shapes and has a few tracks of dancey music and some obnoxious guitar twangy number but the awesomeness of the table far outweighs any perceived cons. Such as the TURNTABLES! Wik-wik-wikka-wik!Such a HIGHLY reccommended buy. In fact, we had a play date with another baby and after playing with the table, the parent went out and got THEIR baby one the next day. Now that's a noteworthy reccommendation to get one for your baby.\"", "I'm playing with this toy along with the baby.  I love that it can be used as a floor toy and although she doesn't know how to do the buttons, she is enjoying whatever she accidentally bats.I'm looking forward to watching her stand with it as she gets older.  There are so many ways to play with this that I can't see it getting outgrow for a long time.Very versatile and I'm sure the microphone will be used a lot if my other granddaughter is any indication.", "Comparable to the Leapfrog Learning Table, less cost, does a bit more.The legs can be removed for sitting. I love that this does more than numbers, colors, and letters. It also teaches Spanish and opposites, etc. Lights up, sings, lots to do. Has a microphone with an almost Kareoke element. In fact, it has like 50 something songs in its arsenal. The really nice thing is if you have a young tot, this doesn't tip easily if they need to pull up. It only take 3 AA batteries, not half bad.Downside is this thing is a pain to clean. If juice, pet hair, crumbs get near it... good luck.", "My little guy loves this table. I like that he can sit while playing this as well.The music is nice and not to loud. I like there are different songs and does not play the same thing over and over again. This will bring out the little rock star or pop princess in any little ones eyes. Your child will never get tired of this because of the different songs. Great to take on the go , and can be played on while a child is laying on the floor as well. Overall great fun, a toy they can keep for a long time, and not grow out of quickly", "I popped this table together in no time and my toddler daughter is delighted with it.  It is colorful, noisy, fun and interesting -- what's not to love?She is a little petite for her age (2 years 8 months), but it is a fine height for her and I can see it still being fine for when she is taller.  Her little brother who is 4 months old LOVES watching her play with it.  I put him in his little foam chair and he really watches her closely as she plays with it.  I hold him up to it and he smacks it enthusiastically with his little hands.  This makes my daughter squeal with delight since she wants to play with him so badly but he is too young to really do anything else yet.  They both use size 3 diapers now, he is a big baby and she is a petite girl so as soon as he can stand it will really be game on.This table will get lots of use over the next few years as he gets old enough to play with it and she can show him how.  It seems well constructed so I think it should last a long time.  It is so cute to see the two of them being able to play and interact with something together!", "Immediately out of the box this toy was a hit, for once no child was tempted to play with the package, the assembly was quick with only 4 snap on legs and it is ready to go. The table itself is sort of loud but very entertaining for the kids, even my older child likes to come play with the baby. There is a switch that changes the mode from educational to music, and my kids almost always put it on music so I think the educational value pretty much goes out the window. The microphone toy is not attached to the table in any way other than being stuck in a hole so it gets separated and lost quite a bit, it is supposed to be a maraca but isn't loud enough to hear over the speakers on the table. The table is easy to move which is good for moving it from room to room but bad because my kids like to move it to climb on so they can reach things. I would recommend it to someone that is looking for a toy to hold a child's attention.", "This is such an adorable toy and a learning tool at that.  We come to love Playskool for their well built toys that we know our children can get plenty of time out of while enjoying themselves and learning.I love to play with toys before I give them to the grandchildren and this is no exception.  There is a button on it to change the language from English to Spanish which benefits a lot of people.  It's also a great way to start your child with learning a second language right from the get go.  I also love that it has an off/on button for those days when mommy might have a headache and even the smallest sound can hurt.The toy lights up and counts from zero to nine, tells basic colors such as red, green and yellow as well as plays music.  It's set on sturdy legs with plenty of room to put on your toddlers lap without it being over cumbersome.  It cleans up easily and just is a quality toy that we can rely on from a quality company."], "Gamma": [0.2147020548582077, 0.2719060480594635, 0.25533589720726013, 0.25805598497390747], "Beta": [[0.05494147166609764, 0.050418421626091, 0.053750380873680115, 0.05229402333498001, 0.054501183331012726, 0.05454675108194351, 0.054199133068323135, 0.0556022934615612, 0.054548535495996475, 0.04054521396756172, 0.04947777837514877, 0.05415943264961243, 0.04577553644776344, 0.05379492789506912, 0.052578698843717575, 0.053549282252788544, 0.057189229875802994, 0.05312886834144592, 0.054998788982629776], [0.05526615306735039, 0.04654957726597786, 0.05409480631351471, 0.05316166579723358, 0.054149363189935684, 0.059454627335071564, 0.0543973483145237, 0.056075748056173325, 0.056197501718997955, 0.034710511565208435, 0.04792336747050285, 0.054140303283929825, 0.04328807070851326, 0.05375960096716881, 0.0524572879076004, 0.054084278643131256, 0.059860847890377045, 0.05413369834423065, 0.056295204907655716], [0.05437344312667847, 0.04476720839738846, 0.0537116676568985, 0.053394511342048645, 0.05376604571938515, 0.058881036937236786, 0.05532156676054001, 0.05422619357705116, 0.05077248439192772, 0.040803831070661545, 0.05245553329586983, 0.05442873761057854, 0.0424734503030777, 0.05464944988489151, 0.05377059802412987, 0.05628444626927376, 0.05910039693117142, 0.05325929820537567, 0.053560126572847366], [0.054545629769563675, 0.04411805793642998, 0.053865544497966766, 0.053409676998853683, 0.05372975766658783, 0.05900299921631813, 0.05572904646396637, 0.05424688011407852, 0.050478387624025345, 0.040304601192474365, 0.05171689763665199, 0.054597750306129456, 0.042623601853847504, 0.0549037903547287, 0.05368589237332344, 0.05654436722397804, 0.05915228649973869, 0.0537053644657135, 0.05363951623439789]]}
