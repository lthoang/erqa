I wrote as much in my review and everyone yelled at me in the comments for reviewing them without an amp.When I saw how these are advertised as working with the various small Apple products I was thinking oh no, here we go again.But no... Unlike most headphones of this sound and caliber they work great (all things considered) directly on an iPhone or computer output.  I've been wearing them most of the afternoon today and no listening fatique at all.  The clarity is excellent, but without the \"\"flat\"\" sound I feel the similar priced Sennheisers have.I've been listening to music I haven't heard for a while all day while working and I keep closing my eyes because it sounds so nice. Not so good for my productivity!SOUND WITH AN AMPJust incredible! It's been about two weeks and I've mostly been listening with an obscenely expensiveBenchmark DAC-1and a little with a (much cheaper)NuForce uDAC-2. The \"\"sound source\"\" for both is USB from iTunes on a recent Mac playing lossless or 256kbit AAC files.  Both amps are good, but in my unscientific switch from one to the other and back tests the Benchmark holds up just a little bit better with some of the details.With an amp the headphones reveal so much detail in the bass while the mids and highs continue to just be incredible clear. In songs it's like the singer is right next to you and the bass feels and sounds like you're right there in the room with the band in a way I didn't hear with the AH-D5000.From a request in the comment I've played a lot of U2 and the bass is incredibly precise without in any way being dry. I've also played my share of electronica and on good recordings it's a lot of fun. I've even re-found some albums that I used to get listening fatigue from that with the new headphones (and an amp) are just great (Live 93 by the OrborDaft Punk's Alive 2007for example).These headphones have also made me get a new appreciation for the American Recordings albums from Johnny Cash (American 3: Solitary Man, etc).FEATURESIt comes with two cables, a short one with a microphone (not tested yet) and the standard apple remote features - very nice.  There's also a thicker and longer cable included \"\"for home use\"\".The carrying bag isn't fancy, but has a hook for an included carabiner to make it easy to hook on to your bag if there's no room inside.The advertised iPhone app is just a (free) music player. It is nice enough but not in any way specific to the headphones (unless I missed something). It has a very nice looking equalizer if you are into thatPACKAGINGIf you are buying this for you then it doesn't matter, but if you are buying a gift then you should know that the box it comes in is nice and expensive looking (except for the little bit of tape holding it closed, not sure why they felt that was necessary and it definitely takes away from the \"\"luxury feel\"\").COMFORTAs I mentioned above I've been wearing them all afternoon today while working. They've been very comfortable. At first I was skeptical about the cable being connected on both sides, but it's fine.My head is pretty big and I am wearing them almost entirely closed, so if you have a small head they might be too big to be comfortable.I don't know if they're actually lighter than my other similar headphones, but other than the since long discontinued Sony's mentioned above they feel the lightest on my head.The sound insulation is also very good, nice and quiet just wearing them. They won't replace the noise cancelling Sennheisers on airplane trips, but for office environments it's great.CONCLUSIONThese are definitely going with me to the office on Monday and they might also get a coveted spot in my bag so I can bring them back home to use, too.\"", "\"As a matter of disclosure, this part time audiophile \"\"got lucky\"\", receiving these headphones for review via the Amazon Vine program. The most expensive audio listening hardware for personal use that this reviewer has had for years are the Shure SE420 earphones. This makes the Denon AH-D600 the most expensive set of headphones this reviewer has personally spent some time with.For personal comparison and for you to know where I have been, I currently own Sennheiser HD595, Bose QC Series 2's, Razer Carcharias (gaming headset) and most recently Audio Technica AT-M50. For even more portability, Shure E-3c, Shure SE-215 and Shure SE-420 earphones are used.  I have a Fiio E11 headphone amp that I use for headphones on my computer and portable devices for volume and sound quality.  I listen to a wide variety of music including ambient-electronic and/or beat oriented electronic, harder industrial rock, garage and noise bands, a variety of alt-folk-country-indie and corporate rock.Appearance.  The AH-D600 is packaged luxuriously in a sturdy and attractive box with the headphones presented on a molded satin bed. The headphones themselves are a mix of metal and plastic with predominating plastic on outer surfaces.  While appearing durable, and with no obvious weak points, the predominance of plastic at this price point is unexpected.Overall appearance is nice but appears bulkier than may be necessary. The earphones are surrounded by the outer plastic piece that extends out a bit further on the tail end than might be necessary. This is an outer appearance and design factor rather than a functionality issue.  Streamlining future versions might include trimming this bottom piece of plastic closer to the actual earphone, reducing size and the appearance of size.Accessories. The AH-D600 comes with two cables, including a primary use cable that is a thick, straight, cloth covered, braided, sturdy cable terminated in a strong metal jack.  An adapter is provided to change the mini jack to a standard, larger headphone jack for full sized amps. A shorter cable that has volume, music control, and phone capabilities (mic/phone connect/disconnect) for portable use is provided. Both cables have two connection points to the left and right earphones. A foldable Denon branded carry pack made of sturdy black Cordura material outside and a bright blue zipper and similarly colored soft micro-suede inside is provided for transport protection. A generic carabineer was included, although its function is not explained.Identity crisis?  These headphones are not what one would consider portable.  They do not fold, they are large, and look large on the head.  The packaging and cable included would indicate that the user can use these for connection to a smart phone.  In fact, there is an app for that! Sound and Vision magazine reports: \"\"The Denon Audio app for the Music Maniac line combines a music player, TuneIn Radio, various EQ presets, and a 100-band user EQ that allows saving and storing your fave settings (in addition to letting you while away a four-hour layover trying to adjust 100 separate bands of equalization).\"\" This app works with the multifunctional cord. Super! This reviewer has 3 player programs with equalization and TuneIn Pro loaded up on apple and android devices. All of them have multiple reasons to be used based not just on hardware (headgear) choice but also on source, source quality, and location (connected to a cloud or not).  Again, while all this is possible, the question is \"\"would\"\" anyone use these headphones paired to their smart phone.  You have that choice.  This reviewer would not.  These headphones are not really portable, are large, and very visible.  They also deserve the best listening conditions.Comfort. The soft leather surrounding the ample and large earphones is super comfortable. The tension of the headphones holds them to your head without being tight while providing good isolation from outside noises.  Noise isolation is passive so you can still hear subdued external noise, and based on listening, unsuitable for air travel isolation.  Long term listening has been pleasant and comfortable.Sound quality, upon initial listening instantly draws you in and makes you want more. That quality of \"\"now I need to listen to my entire collection\"\" (as if that is even possible...) comes to mind.  These AH-D600 sound rich from the get-go. There is a balance between neutral and colored that the AH-D600 handles very well.  Neutral often means \"\"clinical\"\" and maybe \"\"monitor\"\" or flat.  Neutral can be an objective measurement, but listening to headphones is a subjective personal experience. For most listeners, casual to audiophile, this is usually not flat or neutral. Ears are analog devices with their own individual operating specifications! What you want is what you like.My own listening experience.  From my computer and on 320 kps MP3 files, listening to some bass balanced Axiom Funk \"\"Funkcronomicon\"\" \"\"new jazz\"\" showed the AH-D600 capable of providing nice bass extension with pleasant mid range electric guitar notes.  Further into the depth of bass on an amplified CD source, Crystal Method's \"\"Name of the Game\"\" was clean, clear, and while not subsonic, distortion free, extended and felt without being overbearing and out of place with the vocals and electronics. Ishq's Bahkti has become my recent standard for well engineered, \"\"quiet\"\", electronic, and spacious recording on a 256 kps MP3 file from Amazon. For Bahkti, the AH-D600 provides an immersive sound space showing off its own balancing act between the highs, lows and midrange.  U2's Vertigo provided clear instrumental delineation and stage placement (observed through a complete listening of the entire album).  Edge's guitar seems to take a new life with these headphones. Vocals are clear and upfront.  Drums and bass on this U2 recording seem less defined and maybe slightly muddy, but this quality has been observed on other speakers and headphones; attributable to engineering of the original recording.  The same balanced qualities were heard during some extended Beck \"\"Mutations\"\" and \"\"Sea Change\"\" sessions. Highs, over many listening sessions and sources are sparkling and defined without extending into the dog whistle territory that can potentially be irritating.  Cymbals are clearly identifiable by each strand rather than hiss on higher quality sound sources. Piano presence is clear, well defined, and front and center in most solo performed material including some older analog (transferred to digital) Dino Lipatti Chopin Waltzes this reviewer is partial to.Overall efficiency of these headphones makes them suitable for portable uses without additional amplification on Apple and Android based devices.  This reviewer found sound quality greatly improved with the use of an external amp, both high end audio amps and a smaller Fido E11.Summing it up.  The Denon AH-D600 provides excellent sound quality for short and longer term listening and comes recommended for this price point. As for the marketing push to make this headphone \"\"portable\"\" and recommended for iphones and other portable devices, the potential buyer just has to look at pictures and/or handle these headphones to make their own choice about that particular quality.  For this lucky reviewer (see prior disclaimer), these headphones will be used and enjoyed for years, just not for my portable listening experiences.STARSBuild...4.5Comfort...5Overall sound...5Lows...5Mids...5Highs...5Soundstage...4Noise isolation ...3.5Sound leakage (no leakage)...5Use without an amp (efficiency)...4Use with amp...5Appearance...4Portability...2Price to value estimate...4\"", "The Denon headphones are definitely of high quality. I can now enjoy listening to my music without hearing outside noise. It comfortably covers my ears and keeps the quality of the music inside. I love the way the bass sounds. I like the fact that it comes with a long and short cord. I'm pretty sure I won't use the long one that much but I can definitely see myself using it with a computer.I definitely recommended these headphones, because of the quality sound. I'm actually listening to the headphones while I write this review and I am absolutely enjoying it.", "The sound quality of these headphones is absolutely superb!  I don't want to take them off.  My music source has been an iPhone without an external amplifier.  The iPhone has no problem powering these headphones with no additional equipment.  The headphones come in a box that is almost too nice to open.  They would make a wonderful gift.Two cords come with the headphones.  One cord is specifically designed to work with an iPhone.  The cord has a microphone and a three button controller.  You can adjust the volume easily and accurately, start and stop the music and go to the next song or go back to the previous song.  The center button will also let you make or receive a phone call or give Siri a command.  It works well and the microphone delivers clear sound.  The length to me is just right when I put the iPhone in my pants pocket. The end of the cord that goes into the iPhone is beautifully designed.  It won't scratch the iPhone and swivels smoothly.  A lot of thought went into its design.  The second cord is designed to go with something other than iPhone.  Because I plan to use the headphones mainly with the iPhone I am sticking with the iPhone cord.  There also is a carrying case that is nice.  Finally, Denon offers a free app both for the iPhone and Android devices.  With the app, you get a free version of the TuneIn radio app, the ability to play your own music in the app and to see visual equalizer representations that you can adjust within the app.  The bars going up and down in the equalizer are fun to watch.  The app is a thoughtful extra but I doubt I will use it much as I already have radio apps and prefer my music at a neutral equalizer setting.I have listened both to classical music and popular music.  For example, Paganini's 24 Capricci performed by Salvatore Accardo sounds divine and quite neutral to my ear.  I feel the same about Brahms Symphony No. 3.  Popular music (e.g., Heather Small, Celine Dion, Wynter Gordon) sound a tad bass heavy to my ear.  I like the extra bass but others might not.  Some might want more.The Denon AH-D600 are very comfortable to wear although I think they feel a bit heavy -- but nothing to complain about.  It is just something I notice as I wear them.  I have no problem wearing them a long time comfortably.  These headphones with the iPhone cord are designed to be used on the go. Honestly, I think they look really big and dorky.  I can't imagine wearing them on the street.  At home they are wonderful.  My idea of acceptable over the ear street headphones are V-Moda Crossfades.  They sound nice, look better and cost a lot less money.  But the Denon AH-D600s sound a LOT better.  Sonically, the Denon's are in a much higher league.I also own the Sennheiser HD-650, which I have loved for years and are in the same price range.  In comparison, the HD-650s are a bit more comfortable and the sound to my ears is very neutral with any kind of music.  On the other hand, I don't think an iPhone can adequately power the HD-650s but the Denon AH-600s have no problem powering the Denons.  And the HD-650s don't have the nice iPhone cord Denon supplies.  The Sennheisers won't work well on the street but the AH-600s will work fine on the street if you are ok with how they look, which as I said, I am not.  But that's very personal.So I really like these and expect many more hours of listening pleasure with my iPhone -- but not on the street.  Nice job Denon.", "\"I don't own any Apple products, but I got these to use for music listening from my PC or stereo.  And they're really nice - very well-padded earcups, nice sound right out of the box, reasonable isolation even when there's no music playing.  The box in itself probably accounts for 20% of the cost of these babies - it's like a fancy satin-lined jewelry chest!  Definitely reusable for something else; it's nicer storage than a shoe box, that's for certain.The only problem I've found with these - admittedly after only an hour's listening - is that they're really heavy on my head.  Now, I do have some kind of \"\"weak skull\"\" problem - even the Denon AH-D2000, which are renowned for being super-comfortable, make the top of my head hurt after an hour.  So, that might not be a real issue with these 'phones for most users, but they are a slight problem for me.  However, since they are so good in all the other areas, I'll keep using them and just limit my listening.They appear cordless in the pictures, but they're not; they have a special cord for controlling Apple devices and a standard (and very long) cord for regular listening.I have to come back a few days later and append one comment to this review.  IMHO, anybody who's wearing these gigantic headphones while out and about, using them with an iPod or whatever, is going to look ridiculous.  Showoffy.  \"\"Look at my big expensive headphones!\"\"  Don't you want something lightweight and discreet while you're out?\"", "\"Up until now I have owned \"\"on top of the ear\"\" noise cancelling headphones like theSennheiser  PXC 250 II Collapsible Noise-Canceling Headphonesor in-ear earbuds (many sets). The first thing I noticed about these headphones is how comfortable they are for extended listening sessions. I was a bit concerned when I saw how big they are, but the padding is buttery soft and air-like in its feel on the head. The packaging (satin-lined box) is very elaborate, like these are meant to be given as a special gift. The choice of the cord is a nice touch; I prefer the shorter one with the volume controls on it.Visual aesthetics aside, the sound of these headphones is pretty fabulous no matter what music you use then to listen to. The bass is very adequate but not overwhelming, and the rest of the range is well balanced and overall very pleasing.I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great mid-to-upper price range 'phones.\"", "\"Presentation/Packaging:First, these things are beautiful - from their packaging (which is large yet surprisingly minimal) to their actual craftsmanship.  I describe the packaging as \"\"minimal\"\" because, though large only includes the headphones themselves (which rest on a faux-silk/polyester-esque material covering a plastic housing) and, underneath the headphones, only two cables (one ten foot, one three), a zippered carrying pouch and a small pamphlet. Even with the list prices these have, no case is provided to store/protect these (a shortcoming/flaw in this reviewer's opinion).Size/Comfort:Second, the size of these is massive.  I mean massive.  My wife actually laughed when she saw them on my head.  Not only is my head large (a size 8 hat), but the headphones themselves are extremely large - much like wearing those large, 26 oz. cans of canned tomatoes on your ears.  Each earpiece is so large and heavy that, on my set anyway, holding the headphones by the top of the headband would cause the cans to slide down about an inch from where they expand/adjust to fit your head.  This also results in them being uncomfortable after a period of time; you feel their heft, their weight just pulling down on your head and neck.  The minimal padding on the headband does not alleviate this.  While the ear pads are soft and comfortable, they are almost too much so.  I found that mine were significantly molded to the shape they attained by resting in their box (flat on one side).  On a plus side, the cups/pads are large enough to completely cover your ears, but those with small ears will probably find them too large.On the topic of their size, the ten foot cable is huge.  It is thick, it is heavy, it is dual-sided, it is covered in a rough material much like that of some of the older HDMI cables.  The plug which plugs into each ear piece is also so large that you will feel it bump against the tops of your shoulders at times (when you move in certain ways, etc.).  That ten foot cable also adds even more weight to these, causing them to be even more uncomfortable, particularly at the very top of the headband resting on the top of your head.  Although Denon provides what they call an \"\"on-the-go\"\" three foot cable, such a notion fails in practice - practically speaking, these are far too large to carry \"\"on-the-go.\"\" They don't even collapse at all, making the prospect of carrying these around while traveling even more of an effort.Build:As mentioned earlier, these are well made, but mostly plastic.  The padding, also as mentioned above, is soft enough to the point of being too soft.  Even the soft headband might be thick enough to provide comfort were the ear pieces themselves smaller, with less weight, but these particular cans are so heavy (even excluding the weight of the 10-foot cable), that they just pull down and cause the padding on the headband to compress so much it becomes uncomfortable.  But they do seem well built and as if they would last for some time to come (especially since they're so large you'll likely be unable to take them anywhere outside of your house).Sound:Amazing.  Truly a luscious, beautiful sound stage.  From lows, to highs, to mids, all separated nicely, all present, all very natural.  While not a \"\"monitor\"\" type of headphone, it is not overly enhanced.  All genres of music (jazz, blues, rock, classical, pop, soul) sounded excellent.  I loved the sound of these, but the rest of the shortcomings (at least for me) simply didn't justify keeping these, despite their great sound.Price:Lastly, at the time of this review, these headphones are apparently being discontinued and/or being replaced with a newer model.  As a result, my local Best B** had these on clearance for $149.99.  This prompted my immediate purchase of them.  That price is an absolute steal.  Nevertheless, despite being such an incredible value, the other issues listed above could not justify my keeping them and they have been returned.  Point being, if you're interested in picking these up, you'd do well to see if you can first find them at your local BB.In short:All in all, great sounding, well-made headphones, but with too many other flaws (for me) that just prevent them from being keepers.  At the price point offered here, they are vastly overpriced and not worth it. I couldn't even justify keeping them for the $149.99 that I paid.\"", "As someone who also owns the previous generation flaghsip Denon D7000 headphones, which cost almost twice as much as these, I can tell you that these D600 headphones compare pretty favorably. The vocals on the D600 don't sound quite as clear and nice as they are a bit more gainy but for the price, the D600 is really a nice headphone!The D600 provide more isolation and include a better cable system (removable) as well as comes with a nice carrying bag.My initial impressions are that these are great headphones for the price. They have good clear overall sound and natural soundstage with great bass and isolation but may lack a bit of the vocal presence that the D7000s do. They overall design is great with the removable cables and included iPhone/iPod additional cable as well as carrying bag."], "Gamma": [0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534, 0.1111111119389534], "Beta": [[0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937], [0.4871976375579834, 0.0023188553750514984, 0.16928748786449432, 0.0002640572201926261, 0.006334753707051277, 0.0003929689701180905, 0.004345539025962353, 0.329858660697937]]}
