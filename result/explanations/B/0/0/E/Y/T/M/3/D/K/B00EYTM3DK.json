It feels very comfortable in my hands.  The LCD is large and bright and the flash recycle times are very quick.  I am particularly impressed by the quality of indoors photos.  This is my first camera of this type, the camera before this was Canon S5-IS, which is also a great camera, but indoor photos and flash recharge time are better on Fuji.There is no viewfinder on Fuji, which might be a concern in bright sun, Canon has an electronic viewfinder which I used many times when taking pictures outdoors.  I was surprised that the lens cap on Fuji did not have a string.  I need to find a solution for this or I know the lens cap would be lost.  UPDATE:  I solved this problem.  I took a small thin nail, held it with pliers over gas stove fire until it turned red and burned with it a nice small hole in the right side of the top surface that you pinch to remove the lens cap (above the letter F of the word Fujifilm that is on the lens cap).  I took a strap off a portable Altec Lansing USB puck speaker and attached it to the hole.  I then threaded the camera's shoulder through the new lense cap star and now it stays attached to the camera.The display on Canon swings out and pivots, on Fuji it only tilts up and down.  I was glad to find out thatreplacement batteriesfor this camera are relatively inexpensive.  With Canon, I always have a set of charged AA Eneloops with me, and I would want to keep an extra battery with Fuji.Overall, I am not a  professional photographer, so i will probably never use several of this camera's features.  However, we have a child and take a lot of pictures and movie clips, and this is a great camera that takes great pictures and movies and it fits our family's needs.WARNING: Bad experience with Fuji customer service.  After owning the camera for less than a month, we lost the lens hood that came with the kit.  I was unable to find a replacement online.  There are many 58mm cheap generic lens hoods that screw into the lens but for those there were reviews that reported vignetting (although cameras mentioned are non-Fuji); therefore, I wanted to buy a lens hood that clips onto the outside of the lens as the one that came with the camera.  For whatever reason spare parts for Fuji are not as easily available as ofr other brands.  I had no problem finding original lens hoods for Nikon and Canon, just not for Fuji.  Fujifilm USA website does not list lens hood in the lens accessories section, and, in my opinion, the site is not user friendly: some products did not have explanations of what they were, prices were not listed, no options to buy parts.I called the Fuji Camera Parts department.  The first rep transferred me to another rep who apparently was in a different (non-parts) department and the second rep told me that the first rep should have helped me.  The second rep tried for a while although unsuccessfully to locate the part number for the lens hood.  He contacted other people inside the company, but no one knew what the part number was or when it will be available.  At the end the rep said that he was surprised the part was not in the system because the lens was out for some time.  The bottom line is that if you lose a part, you may have to deal with the frustration of talking to Fuji.", "When I opened up this camera and took it out, I was amazed at how light it was.  But before I could use it, I had to charge the battery.  Once the battery was ready, I attached the kit lens to the camera and the tulip lens hood which is made especially for this camera.  I have an array of lenses for my DSLR (my primary camera) and I've never seen a lens hood included.  I packed the camera into a small bag and headed off to share it with several people.First, I shared it with a fellow soccer parent who was shocked at how light it was.  To him, it felt cheap, but when he saw the quality of the pictures he snapped and its ability to outperform my Canon T3i in low light, he realized it was anything but cheap.  He was very impressed.Next, I took it to a daytime soccer practice and a woman who is still sticking with her SLR.  She picked up the bag and thought there wasn't anything in the bag.  She loved the color of the photos and ability to focus on people.Finally, I took it to art class with me and shared the camera with a gentleman in his 60s who wears glasses.  He doesn't want to learn how to use a DSLR, but uses his 6 year old point and shoot digital to take very well composed pictures (which he sells and people do purchase).  He was floored by the ability of this camera to accurately focus on people in the picture.  When he picked up the camera, he shot directly into the light to photograph a particular view of their shot.  I could tell he was recreating a shot he'd attempted before without success on his camera.  He was shocked by the camera's ability to focus on the interior of the shop with the bright sunlight streaming in.  The other feature of this camera he noticed was the lens and the breadth of the image that the camera lens took in.I took this camera everywhere with me for a week.  I pulled it out at my daughter's birthday.  I took pictures of the moon.  I photographed a wide variety of subjects.  I was constantly amazed by this camera's ability to take pictures in low light settings.  Often my DSLR couldn't compete at all.  I took pictures of the moon in which the leaves framing the moon were clear on this camera, but were very blurry (even in manual setting with as low a shutter speed that wouldn't result in shaking when hand held) on my Canon.  I had already noticed that my Canon struggles to focus when low light is present in the evening.  I tried to use manual focus, but wasn't able to detect with my own eye when the subject was in focus.  This X-A1 is amazing though!  In dark settings where there is almost no light (not even the moon), I do need to use the flash for the subject to be in focus, but it can do it!The flash on the camera is very unique, but it works so well that there is no red-eye in the pictures the camera takes.  Many people might miss the viewfinder, but people with glasses or who are used to smart phones or point and shoot digital cameras that don't have a viewfinder will love this one!  It took me a bit to get used to photographing with the screen, but I could do it.My one and only concern about this camera (as a DSLR gal who regularly switches between different prime lenses) was the plastic lens cap that the kit lens came with.  I contacted someone at Fujifilm and they did confirm that when you purchase additional lenses, they come with a locking cap on the mount.  This would be a concern if you were carrying any additional lenses with this body and kit lens.  The plastic cap simply came off too easily.  So, I'm glad that's not the case.  The only other question I had was how you know when the battery is full.  And the answer is that the light on the charger will turn off.  I always recommend to camera users to carry an extra fully charged battery with you.  You don't want to be caught without one in the middle of an event.So, who will love this camera?+ Smart Phone and iPod users+ People with glasses+ Teens learning photography+ Just about anyoneWhat do I love about this camera?+ It's ability to take low light pictures+ The ability of the camera to format and even add filters to pictures right on the camera.+ The ability of the camera to wirelessly send pictures to a printer or computer.+ The lightness of this camera and ease of carrying it.+ The ability for this camera to make no sound at all when taking a picture.Is this a camera I'd recommend?  Yes.  If you've looked into mirrorless cameras, this is a great choice.  Other lenses are available--expensive, but very high quality and comparable in cost to the zooms for other camera lines.  Not many prime lenses available yet, but I hope Fujifilm will expand these offerings in the future.  If you want a camera with a viewfinder that's just as light, you could look at the fujifilm x-20.  It has a fixed lens, but would be a significant upgrade from a point and shoot, if you're looking for a really light camera.  You might wonder if I will choose this camera now over my DSLR.  The answer is usually not.  I have a 40 mm pancake lens on my Canon that I love.  I prefer to carry several prime lenses instead of a zoom.  And I'm very used to it.  But, when I'm heading out in the evening and I know I'll be in low light situations or when I need a small camera, I'll be picking this one up instead and taking it along!Everyone I showed this camera to has been impressed... and so am I.  It's a solid entry-level performer with features and abilities you won't expect!One post script.  You will want to purchase a larger SD memory card for this camera.  It does not come with one.", "X-A1 is an exciting little camera that has one feature that many Fuji X user appreciate - Bayer layout sensor.  Many of us do not like Xtrans sensors for various reasons: from its rendering of greens (mushy greens when you shoot landscapes with trees in the background) which dpreview review finally acknowledged in its XM1 review, to problems with rendering Raw files via Adobe.  There are countless discussions currently happening in various forums from fujirumors to dpreview and others, what's better Xtrans (X100s/XE1/XPro1/XM1) or Bayer (X100/XA1).  Many X100 owners did not upgrade to X100s due to the fact that Fuji switched from normal Bayer layout sensor to Xtrans.The new XE2 (announcement Oct 16, 2013) will again feature Xtrans II sensor (First seen in X100s).For those who are not aware of the problems and deciding between XM1 and XA1, the issue with RAW and Xtrans is that if you use Adobe programs in your workflow to store/edit photos, Adobe has real problem with translating RAW files from Xtrans sensors.  It does a very poor job and the results are bad.  On the other hand, it render RAW files from XA1 beautifully, as these are regular Bayer type sensor files which are easy for Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom.  So the users of Xtrans cameras that like to shoot RAW have been doing workarounds by using various 3d party software to convert from Iridient to Capture1, etc.These workarounds, as far as I am concerned, are pain in the neck for someone like me.  I have been using Adobe Lightroom for years now.  My entire photo collection is catalogued in Lightroom.  I import all photos from every camera I have through Lightroom and then I edit photos in Lightroom, and sometimes use Photoshop or Silverfx if necessary, then upload photos where I need them to go again via Lightroom.  Lightroom does fine for RAW files from all my other cameras.  Why do I need to spend extra time and effort dealing with Xtrans conversion through a 3d program? What a waste.  Some say it is Adobe's problem that they cannot convert and render Xtrans files.  Perhaps it is, but Adobe Lightroom works for me.On the other hand, if all you shoot is Jpegs and Fuji Jpegs are the best, XM1 or XA1 should be fine for you (with exception of problem with landscape greens in XM1).Going to XA1, it is a tiny camera.  So tiny that to hold it comfortable I had to use the thumb grip (which I had already owned from my XE1 days).  This is the thumb grip that I am using with XA1:Fotodiox Mirrorless Digital Cameras Type AWith the thumb grip it is very comfortable in my hand.The only other issue is a lack of viewfinder of any sort.  Some of use need/got used to viewfinder.  I myself often find myself pressing this camera to my face and then realizing there is no viewfinder for me to look through.  I'd love to have a viewfinder but It is not there.  If you want viewfinder, get XE1 or the upcoming XE2.  But dont forget XE1 focuses slower than XA1.  Also XA1 has face recognition which makes focusing faster (XE1 has no face recognition) if you employ it to shoot photographs of people.  Now the AF will still not be in the league of latest Panasonic/Olympus m43 cameras, but I think it is at this point as good as Sony NEX-7 for example.Ultimately, the picture quality is astounding, this tiny camera gives you a world-class photo, the top of the class for APS-C sensor.  And you are not paying much for it.  5 stars easily.", "For a recreational photographer who uses a Nikon DSLR, the first thing you notice is how a camera like the Fujifilm X-A1 can deliver similar results. And it generally does.The pictures with low light are very good. I take a lot of action shots and the ability to focus during sports events is easy with a turn of a knob. At the entry-level, the zoom is good enough in the kit lens provided.  I expect the additional lenses that Fuji will work wonders.  However, for the novice who needs easy access to a camera when the &#34;right moment&#34; comes, this is perfect. More importantly, the colors are awesome and the image quality is pretty good. The camera also uses wifi for easy transfer to a computer or your smart phone.The only issue for me is that the LCD monitor is the only option to frame your photos as there is no viewfinder. Also there is no real grip in the camera body. This is the reason for the 4 stars. However, the overall lightness and easy access for a camera this good will make you overlook these minor issues. Overall, a great buy!", "\"Thanks to those who took the time to post comments so I could make some corrections to the initial review.It was with much anticipation that I waited to try this Fuji X-A1 camera out.  I already own a Fuji X-E1.  So I thought: This would be a smaller lighter Fuji, with a few less bells and whistles, but with that great Fuji design and picture quality.  This is a pretty good effort.In much of this review I compare certain aspects of the X-A1 to the X-E1.  To some extent this might be unfair because the X-E1 costs about $400 more.  But I still thought this would be useful for some people who wonder what more do I get with the X-E1, or what's missing in the X-A1.  Actually the X-A1 has many features not found on the X-E1...notably the ability to take movies with a dedicated button, the wifi capability and the tilting screen.  But unlike the X-E1, the X-A1 does not have an electronic viewfinder.  You only have the LCD screen to frame your picture.  The ultimate grade I gave the X-A1 camera, had nothing to do with comparisons to X-E1.  Rather it was based on the X-A1 alone.1.  First, while the weight of camera and 16-50mm lens is slightly less than the X-E1 with its kit 18-55mm lens, it is not game changing.  The X-A1 with its kit lens weighs in at 19 oz while the X-E1 weighs 23.9 oz.2.  Instant review is disabled by default.  Thanks to one of the comments posted below, I discovered that there is a menu option to turn it on for .5 or 1.5 seconds if you like.  I like .5 seconds.  Look in the First wrench in menu, and go to the \"\"Screen Set-Up.\"\"  You will find the option there.3.  The one thing I found annoying thing is the stiff operation of the 16-50mm kit lens.  It should not be this difficult to zoom a lens.  It makes you focus on your handling of the camera, instead of the picture you are trying to take.4.  At first I thought the metering on the camera was overexposing the pictures.  But that appears to be because the in camera photo rendering does not always show the pictures as they will appear on your computer.  Once loaded into the computer, the images appeared to be properly metered.  Keep in mind that you can always adjust the camera setting with exposure compensation.  I should add that when viewed in the camera, pictures in Velvia appeared to be more saturated than you might expect. But on the computer, they looked good.5.  I found that the X-E1 with its kit lens took a bit more detailed pictures than the X-A1 with its kit lens.  I'm not sure if this is a lens or sensor issue.  The X-A1 has a different sensor than the X-E1.  When viewed in camera, the differences seems more pronounced then on the computer.  Once viewed in the computer, the differences are subtle.  Most people will be very pleased with the image quality of the pictures taken with the X-A1.Since the X-A1 is several hundred dollars less than the XE-1, I expected the build quality too be lower.  It is lower, but other than the stiff zoom, it is not bad at all.I found that the camera's handling was not as nice as on the X-E1.  Because it is a smaller camera, Fuji took out buttons that could be operated with your left hand.  Everything (except for maybe the flash button) operates with the fingers in your right hand.  This works decently enough.  But I found that sometimes, I didn't move my hand fast enough to change the settings before time expired.  For instance in the X-E1 you hit the macro button, raise your finger a little and turn the wheel to adjust the Macro on or off...works great.  But in the X-A1, you hit the macro button, then have to raise your hand a bit to reach one of the the two wheels that change the setting.  Looking at it, you would think the two would operate equally efficiently.  But I found that in practice, in the X-A1 the macro choice would time out before I changed the setting...and I had to start over again. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  In the end you normally get use to the handling characteristics of a camera.The X-A1 has a conventional Bayer color filter, instead of the fairly unique X-Trans design of the X-Pro and X-E1.  Some users have expressed frustration with RAW conversion of the X-Trans design.  Since I'm a JPEG user 99% of the time, this is not an issue for me.The XA-1 camera does not have a viewfinder.  So it relies totally on the LCD screen in the back for framing the picture, setting shooting options and viewing pictures in playback.  While some people cannot fathom buying a camera at this price point that does not have a viewfinder, (electronic or optical), I notice that younger people are quite accepting of just having the LCD screen in the back. That is an item of personal preference, so I did not downgrade the X-A1 for not having some type of viewfinder.One thing I noticed is that once the camera goes into sleep mode, it sometimes (but not always) takes longer than other cameras to wake up after you press the shutter button.  This causes a delay that interferes with taking pictures quickly.As mentioned above, the X-A1 does add some nice features like a dedicated movie button, Wi-Fi capability, Portrait Enhancer, nice tilting LCD screen and others.The more I use this camera, the more I've grown to like it.  Those who saw the earlier version of this review may have noticed that I steadily increased the rating, which is now 5 STARS.A tip for using the Wireless Function.1. download the Fuji Camera Application for your tablet or phone.  (I use Ipad, and the rest of the instructions are for Ipad or Iphone).2. Go the Settings in the IPAD and tap Wi-Fi.3. Now put the X-A1 in PLAYBACK mode, and press the Wi-Fi button on top of the camera.4. Press \"\"VIEW AND OBTAIN\"\" picture.  The X-A1 will now create a WiFi network.5. Go back to your IPAD and see if the Fuji Wi-Fi appears in the settings under Wi-Fi.  When you see it click on it and you are now connected.6. Now go to the Fuji Camera Application on your IPAD and press Browse and then Connect.  The pictures in the XA1 will not appear in the Fuji Camera Application.  This is a slow process.7. Finally,in the Fuji Camera Application select the pictures you wish to import into the Ipad and tap \"\"Import\"\".Maybe there is a shorter route to get this to work, but this is the best I could find.  The instruction book was not as helpful on this point as it could be. It makes it seem as though the XA1 will find your existing network.  I could never get it to do that.  Instead what I found was that the XA1 creates its own network, and you have to look for it on you IPAD. It could be that the process is easier on an Android device. Not sure. If anyone has better instructions for the Wi-Fi operation, post it in the Comment section.  Thank you.\"", "This is a really great little camera. The photo quality is simply amazing for a $600 point and shoot camera. I can't imagine anyone taking this on a trip and not being happy with the photos. With a camera like this, there is no need to get a $$600-$1500 DSLR setup unless you are planning on doing some professional work that requires it. Plus, this camera is much smaller and lighter than the typical DSLR body and lens. The only issue I can see some not liking with this camera is that there is no viewfinder. Personally, with a camera like this (a point and shoot) I don't really use or expect a viewfinder. For me the rear LCD is sufficient. If you are someone who really wants one you will need to opt for the more expensive XPro-1 or the XE1. The bottom line is this: if you want something more serious than a pocket point and shoot camera but you don't want to lug around a DSLR, this is the camera for you without reservation. The pictures are phenomenal and the camera is super easy to use. Even if you decided to buy a DSLR later you will still likely hang onto this for portability and convenience. An awesome camera; 5/5 stars.", "Yup, I like this camera very much with a couple of reservations. It's light and compact - half the size of my DSLR Pentax with absolutely no drop off in quality. Apparently this model has a smaller sensor than the Pro models in the X series, but unless you're a pro yourself, you won't be able to tell the difference. I took one picture of my daughter and one of her friends that is absolutely gorgeous.Another thing I like is that the camera will bracket your shots for you automatically, not only by f stop, but also by film style. Very cool, though I have to remember to hold the camera still during this process since it takes a moment to snap three pictures.My nitpicks:No optical viewfinder - being an old-school guy, my preference is to frame the scene through a viewfinder not on the LCD screen, though I must say I haven't had problems seeing the image in the screen yet.Stiff zoom. Twisting the zoom takes a fair amount of energy and hand strength. I'm not sure it will loosen up as time goes on.The Wi-Fi transfer is only available if you're using a Windows box. Mac users (ahem) are out of luck, but my Macbook Air has a card reader so I'm not all that put out about it.Finally a correction:One one review, someone was griping about their photos not remaining on the LCD screen for review after they took one. You can specify a longer delay for the photo to remain on the screen, you just have to RTFM or dig through the various menus.I'd recommend this camera if you're looking for a light, compact fairly versatile camera for everyday use.", "Nice camera for the price. The swivel screen is a plus. I am a tall guy, so getting shots low to the ground are a little hard on my knees sometimes. This helped alot. Picture quality is excellent, build quality is ok. The lens feels a little cheap and plasticky but sturdy enough. I ended up returning it because the lens made a weird &#34;click&#34; just before the 50mm zoom range. Ive owned many lenses and never ran into that issue before. I own too many cameras already so i didnt ask for a replacement. But i would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a decent SLR replacement or travel camera. Very small and easy to carry. I really liked it. Maybe i will give this camera another look if and when Fuji updates the model.", "\"The entry-level mirrorless X-A1 offers very high quality images and loads of features in a smaller, lighter package for a smaller, lighter price than a DSLR.  It will do most, but not all, of what a DSLR will do.  It uses a 16.3 megapixel large APS-C CMOS sensor, and takes amazing pictures in low light without a flash.  I've used it indoors at night, and if there's decent artificial light the pictures are bright and sharp.  It does have a small manual pop-up flash, which is adequate but there's a hot shoe for a more powerful flash as needed, or when using a lens hood.  The shutter response as well as startup time are plenty quick for my needs, although no doubt there are some faster ones out there.  There's no viewfinder, only an articulated  3\"\" screen.  The screen, however, is bright and viewable from a wide angle, and tilts to allow shooting from many angles, overhead, etc.The body is plastic but feels solid and durable.  The included F3.5-5.6 OIS 16-50mm kit lens, also plastic, is of good quality and reasonably fast for a short-range zoom, but I would have preferred a little more length.  The 55-200mm Fujifilm telephoto needed to integrate with the body is reputedly excellent but costs more than the camera kit.The X-A1 includes Wi-Fi for easy image transfer to a smartphone or PC, and one-touch HD video recording.Among the many excellent cameras on the market, the XA-1's strength is its excellent image quality and low-light performance in a light, small package allowing use of top-quality lenses for those seeking to take truly excellent photographs at a reasonable price.\"", "\"If you haven't looked into these Fuji \"\"X\"\" cameras, they deserve a look before you make your next major camera purchase. This latest release from Fuji, which comes at an extremely reasonable price, is easily an \"\"outperformer\"\" when it comes to picture quality and device quality. The images you can take with it will rival those taken by the much more expensive (and physically larger) Nikons and Canons. If that is a claim that is very hard to believe, you should do some online searching for reviews on these Fuji cameras and their lens offerings. The reviews are almost uniformly positive, and my own experience with this X-A1 agrees.This particular version comes with either a dark blue or black textured finish which is very comfortable to hold while at the same time providing a good \"\"grippy\"\" surface. (It feels not wholly unlike the back of the earlier version of the Nexus 7 tablet, with a surface that almost does not feel like metal or plastic; you just have to feel it to understand.) The camera is very light, and even with the lens and battery attached, you are only at a fraction of what your typical DSLR will weigh. There is no viewfinder, either optical or electronic, but there is a gorgeous, tilting 3-inch high resolution screen. This is a full APS-C sensor, the same size as most all DSLRs that are not full frame, and, of course, hugely larger than nearly all point and shoots, including the 1-inch models that have recently been released by the various manufacturers. This model is based on the well received Sony 16mp sensor that is found in a number of other cameras (some of the Sony NEX models, at least one Olympus model, and at least one or more Nikon models), and does not make use of Fuji's \"\"X trans\"\" sensor that is found on its X-Pro 1. So, although this model is using a far more traditional sensor, the sensor itself has been very well received in the photographic community, and its use in this model is one reason for the very reasonable price. Fuji is also undoubtedly utilizing some very sophisticated processing \"\"down the pipeline\"\" from the image sensor to arrive at such excellent photographic quality.The camera is reasonably comfortable to hold, due primarily to its light weight, but because the hand grip is not very deep, it can be a challenge to keep a good grip until you get the knack of it. The camera's fantastic screen that allows you to compose either above, under, or even with eye level (the screen tilts both up and down to facilitate this) is wonderful. Operational performance of the camera is good. Turn on is nearly instantaneous, and there is very little focusing lag (maybe not quite 100% as fast as some of the Sony's, but very, very fast, and I doubt you'd notice much of a difference), and shut down is also fast. Picture playback on the screen is also very fast, with little hesitation or stutter. The exception to this rule is that when the camera goes into power saving \"\"sleep\"\" mode, it is quite sluggish to get it woken back up, sometimes in the neighborhood of 2-3 seconds.There is much more I can say about these types of features, but where this camera excels is in photo quality. Even with the kit lens that comes with this Fuji model the photos are sharp, sharp, sharp, with very nice color and saturation. And I mean, REALLY good. My own experience even with this kit lens is that the camera is knocking off images that rival my Nikon D7000. That might be difficult to believe, and I was skeptical myself until I started examining my own images. There is amazing clarity in these shots, and this is even using just the standard jpg format (not even using RAW mode), so it seems that the jpg rendering engine is doing a superb job of processing the shots.But it is the Fuji lenses that are also being identified as some of the best lenses currently on the market (this camera, along with the other Fuji interchangeable lens cameras, uses the Fuji X-Mount system). Even this kit lens is sharp, with virtually no edge distortion or softness, with images that are sharp and straight across the frame. This particular lens is a Fuji \"\"XC\"\" model, and starts at a wide 16mm (24mm equivalent) at F/3.5 and goes to 50mm (75mm equivalent). Are you worried that F/3.5 is not wide enough for low light settings? This is one of the places where these Fuji's excel. There is so little noise in shots that you can run up and down the ISO levels and get perfectly acceptable shots all the way up to 3,200 ISO. (I know that is hard to believe, but I've experienced it myself, and you can check other reviews of the camera along these lines).You can purchase the very highly reviewed \"\"XF\"\" lenses, but you might find that the kit lens is all you need for now. It is simply an amazing combination of lens quality, camera performance, and jpg rendering engine. And at its price point, which is lower than some of the new \"\"super\"\" point and and shoots, it seems like an unbeatable combination.There are a few non-Fuji X-Mount lenses now available, but they tend to be either highly expensive (the Zeiss \"\"Touit\"\" lenses) or quite inexpensive (Samyang, Rokinon). For now, unless you have the money to spring for Zeiss, Fuji's own lenses seem by far the better choice, with high image performance and build quality.I will expand this review over time, but for now, what I want to say is that if you are considering a new camera purchase, you really owe it to yourself to look over these Fuji's before you make a decision. They are superlative devices.Plusses++ Superb image quality, with sharp, rich, and undistorted images even from the kit lens++ Low noise high ISO performance that must surely rank as some of the best available today++ Outstanding 3-inch, one million pixel LCD screen with full set of customizable display options++ Lightweight and easy to handle (though grip is too shallow for most people's fullest comfort)++ Excellent build quality (primarily the camera, but the lens is good for a kit model)++ Very nice image color rendition (many of my images remind me of those taken with my favorite Zeiss lenses, and, yes, I understand that may be difficult to believe)++ \"\"Velvia\"\" color mode available in \"\"P\"\" mode (simulates Fuji Velvia film)++ Large feature set roughly analogous to most DSLRs (S, A, P, M modes, and many other specialized modes)++ Shots per battery exceed specifications in my own daily use (but drops precipitously at the end; keep a backup handy)++ Extremely reasonable price for what you get (it may be all you need, in some cases)++ Great implementation of \"\"focus peaking\"\" for manual focusing++ A variety of \"\"XF\"\" lenses are available, most reviewed as some of the best lenses on the market++ A 55-200mm \"\"XC\"\" lens is available at a very reasonable price++ Built-in WiFi (some will make use of this, others not)++ Full printed manual comes in the box++ Blue body color available, if that is of interest to you (all black is currently the other body color option) - the blue is dark, and not overly \"\"showy\"\"Minuses-- Hand grip would be slightly more comfortable if a bit thicker-- Tendency to overexpose, and this is true inside, as well as outside (use the EV setting in \"\"P\"\" mode to control for this)-- Focusing issues in low light (the camera won't autofocus at all when it is very, very dark)-- Autofocusing options limited, compared to other cameras in class (center weighted only, selected point only; manual; no multi-point AF)-- Manual focus peaking only available in one color, white-- Fujifilm brand batteries are expensive (true of all \"\"brand\"\" batteries)-- Wake up from power save sleep too slow (about 2 - 3 seconds, depending on level of sleep)-- Mechanical power switch not as smooth to rotate as one would prefer-- No viewfinder of any typr (if you want to use a viewfinder, this X-A1 model will not work for you; you'll need one of the other Fuji models)-- No hand strap provided (only a neck strap; a hand strap is, for me, a much more useful device)-- Manual has no index at the end, making it difficult to look up specific features/functions that you are trying to research-- Kit lens has limited macro ability (minimum focusing distance about 30 cm)-- Lens cover may come off a bit too easily-- Charger unit comes with long, heavy a/c cord; this is unnecessarily heavy and not nearly as portable as a built-in flip-switch style of plug found on many charger units-- \"\"XF\"\" lenses very expensive (but only in a relative sense; they are often compared in quality and performance to Leica lenses 10 times their price)Two-Month Shooting UpdateAfter returning from France and from three weeks of shooting in Paris with my wife, all I can say again is WOW. Some of the images this little guy knocks out can are nothing short of incredible. I used three lenses (the 16-50mm XC kit lens that comes with the camera, the 55-200mm XF, and the 35mm XF lenses), and I captured images that are simply among the best I've ever gotten over years of shooting with all kinds of cameras. And it's not just the expensive \"\"XF\"\" lenses that account for the quality, although both of these XF lenses here are simply superb (and it shows in the images). Many of the shots I took with the kit lens are simply spectacular. Deep, rich, sharp images that, at times, seem to \"\"pop\"\" out from the frame (try experimenting with -1.0 EV, and shooting in Velvia color when shooting in \"\"P\"\" mode), and I keep asking myself why I've spent so much money on equipment over the years when this $600 camera and lens often runs circles around them. I even dropped my 16-50mm lens on the Passy Viaduct in Paris, bounced it three times off the concrete, leaving two gouges in the plastic casing, and the guy just keep shooting (although there is no guarantee this will always be the result.) Yes, the grip is a bit uncomfortable at times, due to its shallow depth, and there are some peculiarities that take getting used to (Why can't I turn off the screen info data when rotating the control dial? And why isn't there a built-in help menu, such as used by Sony, to give me help with some arcane settings?), but this is all just quibbling. I keep returning back to the images themselves. Simply stunning. Its one of the most exciting and forward-thinking systems I've ever used. Shooting at 3200 ISO with almost no noise? It's true (although sharpness suffers somewhat). Handheld shots in dark interiors? The camera did it for weeks. Shots within museums? Amazing clarity and sharpness. And, if you're willing to switch to manual focusing, the focus peaking feature allows you to get some truly sharp images (and will reveal just how much error can sometimes be present with auto focusing). The XF line of lenses (at least the two I used) are simply incredible, with a superlative build quality that can be clearly discerned (and with prices to match),  but don't rule out the 16-50mm XC kit lens. Some of the best shots I took were from the kit lens. I don't want to exaggerate here, but once I got home and started looking at the photos more carefully on a high resolution computer screen, I was amazed.Some of the Fuji Lenses:The cost reducedFujifilm XC 50-230mm F4.5-6.7 Camera LensSome of the more expensive, highly reviewed \"\"XF\"\" lenses:Fujifilm XF 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 Zoom LensFujifilm XF 14mm F2.8 Lens Wide Angle LensFujifilm XF 27mm F2.8 Compact Prime LensFujifilm XF 18-55mm F2.8-4.0 Lens Zoom LensFujifilm XF 35mm F1.4 LensFujifilm XF 60mm F2.4 Macro LensHighly Recommended for this Camera:OP/TECH USA Cam Strap - QD (Black)- the perfect size for this cameraWasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Fujifilm NP-W126- almost as good as the Fuji brand battery, and a charger that's betterExpert Shield Screen Protector for: FujiFilm X-M1- fits perfectly on the X-A1\"", "As a Fuji X-E2 owner, I quickly fell in love with the Fuji sensor, design philosophy, and lenses.  Ah the lenses ... They became so alluring that I soon wanted to have more than one mounted on a body and ready to go, so thus I started looking for another body.  While I'm still a SLR shooter, I found that I used the EVF on the X-E2 sparingly, so I opened up my options to include smaller bodies like the X-A1, and I'm glad I did.The A1 offers solid ergonomics, albeit adapted for more of a novice audience compared with the X-E2 and X-Pro 1.  That doesn't mean this camera cannot produce excellent results, whether via the manual controls (not quite as easy to access as on the other bodies) or special modes designed to help beginners.  The feel in the hand is solid and exudes quality--only modestly adapted to a lower pricepoint.  This continues with the rather nice screen and included lens (a step above most beginner &#34;kit&#34; lenses, though a notch below the 18-55mm OS of the X-E2).A couple things to note:This camera lacks Fuji's X Trans sensor with their proprietary pixel arrangement.  This isn't a bad thing (Nikon, Canon, etc... take great pictures with similar sensors to this), but for someone looking to precisely match the &#34;look&#34; of other Fujis, this can be an issue (it's why I ultimately switched to a X-M1).It's not a pocketable camera, even with the tiny 27mm lens.  It can work in a huge pocket, but unless you're a kangaroo, it's a compact camera that will need to go elsewhere.While this focuses much faster than previous generations of mirrorless cameras (and most SLRs in Live View mode), it's nowhere near as fast as a SLR in continuous burst focusing.None of this should deter most of you from buying this.  The above are niche scenarios, and frankly this is an amazing camera.  As I mentioned before I ended up getting a X-M1 to replace this (and accompany my X-E2), but that's not necessarily an indictment on this great camera.", "\"# MEET THE NEW FUJI X-A1, A \"\"MIRRORLESS COMPACT\"\" CAMERAFuji has built itself a good reputation in the higher end of the currently very active Mirrorless Compact market, by coming up with new sensor designs and producing quality lenses. This camera is a little different though; it's more of a \"\"value\"\" product. For example, it doesn't have their famed X-trans sensor, the body feels a bit cheap with no rubbery grip, and the non- touch screen doesn't do all that well in sunlight. I'd say say that most (but not all!) aspects of this camera are good, but not great. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's properly reflected in the price - which it is.# KIT LENS AND X- LENS SYSTEMThe kit lens disappointed me initially, because it looks even cheaper than the body and the slippery zoom ring is a bit hard to move, especially with slightly moist fingers. I came around though when I saw the pictures that it was capable of producing: tack- sharp and beautiful, putting my Panasonic GX7+Kit to shame - a system that costs twice as much! Also this lens starts at an equivalent of 24mm, which is considerably more wide- angle than most standard zooms. I think that many people will probably simply leave the kit lens on and they won't miss a thing.Fuji also offers a50-230mm telezoom lenslens of similar characteristics as the kit lens (i.e. \"\"value\"\" and still fairly compact, they call it the \"\"XC\"\" line), and there is an upgrade path with the \"\"XF\"\" line lenses. The latter lenses are larger and more expensive, but also more solidly built and with more options such as on- lens button for the stabilizer or an aperture ring. Painfully missing (to me) in the entire line-up is a wideangle pancake prime lens though, something that I really like for hiking. I do know that it's particularly hard to make such a lens for APS-C sensors, but Samsung has done it (for their incompatible system, that is).# APS-C SENSORFuji uses an APS-C sized sensor in this camera (same size as most DSLRs), which has some implications:- First, the format is 3:2, which is more widescreen than the 4:3 used in Point & Shoots and the Micro Four Thirds System. I actually find this an advantage especially for landscape pictures, but YMMV. If you're willing to lose some resolution, you can also pick a 1:1 or 16:9 format (but still no 4:3, oddly).- Another implication of the sensor size is that you get a narrower depth of field. This should be expected and is desirable in my book, but it's also easier to get an out-of-focus picture if one is not careful.- Last but not least, the large sensor size means lower picture noise. Sometimes the camera goes up to ISO 3200 and I don't see noise in the picture! No doubt there's some in- camera processing, but still, I can now take hand- held night shots and they look smooth! Again, this \"\"kills\"\" the images that the expensive Panasonic GX7 produces at high ISO.# HANDLING THE CAMERAThere aren't many bells and whistles, and I may be a little old school for liking it that way. The M, A, P and S modes are solid, in fact I was delighted to find that Manual works with auto-ISO! Apparently that's not standard even in DSLRs, but to me it just makes sense that somebody wants to pick shutter and aperture, with the camera then picking ISO up to your set limit. Also, the mode switching and parameter- changing is easy and quick. I find that a little ridiculous to have to mention even, but I own other cameras that take a second switching modes (one even shows a full- screen notice \"\"You have chosen S mode. This is good for ..blah blah..\"\") or clutter up the display with annoying colorful bars when you adjust a parameter.# QUESTION MARKSAfter about a month of use, I did find a few things that I found a little bothersome:1) The autofocus is slow and \"\"hunty\"\" (for lack of a better word; what I mean is it's overshooting the focus zone to realize it needs to go back, even if you're just taking a second picture with the lens already in perfect focus). It's particularly unsuited for movies, which Fuji seems to know, as you can set a dedicated movie focus mode such as manual. Also, there is an explicit macro mode like on Point & Shoot cameras. By contrast, the autofocus on the Panasonic is so dead-on-instant that you can easily use it for movies and it doesn't hunt at all. That's an unfair comparison I know, but still I think the autofocus is by far the biggest downside of this camera. Firmware update 1.0.1 addresses this, but I have not seen a marked improvement. Yet? All this is less important if you shoot landscapes, of course.2) The flash system is quite finicky. The built-in flash is a bit underpowered to start with, and I get inconsistent results (dark face on one shot, overexposed the next).3) Unfortunate button assignment. There aren't too many buttons on this camera (and none on the lens), so it bothers me a bit that two buttons are used for Macro (should not exist, just give me good autofocus) and White Balance (people who really care shoot RAW).# VERDICTMy \"\"question marks\"\" list seems a little long, but it's mostly workable and the only remaining weakness is the mediocre autofocus, which may not even be an issue for many types of photography. On the plus side, we have the stunning picture quality and the very competitive price. Speaking of competition, I don't think there is much else in this category as of December 2013 as it even underprices cheap DSLRs and Sony's NEX3 line.I've come to think of the X-A1 as a \"\"I love it\"\" product with half a star dinged for the so-so autofocus, which technically still rounds back up to 5 stars. If you know what you're getting, i.e. a \"\"value\"\" camera with jaw- dropping picture quality, everything should fall into place and I predict you'll be very happy with this product.\"", "When a photographic opportunity arises...The casual photographer will just pull out his smartphone to take a shot.The more serious photographer will pull out his/her compact point and shoot to take that shot.The die hard photographer, pro, or prosumer, will throw down his 15 pound camera bag, and rapidly pull out his dlsr + f2.8 lens to take that shot. (Pro's aka paid photographers will have the camera's permanently strapped to their tired necks... btw, so no need to throw down any 15 pound camera bag)However, someone once said, the best camera, is the one you actually have on hand with you when the moment strikes.------------------Choosing the right camera for the job is a really tricky thing. Lots of times, it is only the larger packages which has any chance of producing great images, also, the optics of the lens in front of the sensor makes a big difference. What is the baseline that I'm comparing this to?What other cameras have I tried?-Nikon D40/80/90/300/700/800-Fuji X100s and X100, X10, and X20The fuji X100s and X100 were quite amazing, but IMO overpriced. (This is very debatable, but IMO 1000+ bucks for a fixed lens camera is quite steep, especially if u have other DLSR cameras + lenses lying around)The X10 and X20 just were lacking in the image quality front. The photos just weren't good enough.Where does that leave us with the X-A1?This camera has amazing potential. Great low light performance, great images, nice small solid compact body, great LCD screen, are just some things that come to mind.Yes, they had skimped on a bunch of features which need to be pointed out. Firstly, lack of optical view finder.. well.. the optical view finder of the X10 and X20 were just a joke, the X100s was fantastic (had both optical that was accurate, and also electronic), X100 was ok (optical was good, electronic didn't have enough resolution).So.... do you really need an optical view finder to take your photos? If you are a pro photographer who takes 1000+ shots a sitting, then you will probably want an optical view finder. If you are shooting casual, ie... family, or travel, then.. you may not need an optical viewfinder. Yes, there are several advantages of optical view finders, for example, having the eye next to the eye-piece encourages a stable posture when shooting the shot.Another quirk of the X-A1 it when comes to navigating the photos, for whatever reason, I was having problems zooming in and out of photos. The camera would just stutter and not zoom in or out. This is possibly fixed in future firmware patches.To summarize, this camera is clearly worthy of a 2nd look. If you have a chance, try one out in a store, play around with it! The kit 16-50mm lens feel sturdy, a little stiff, but performs well. As this is an interchangeable lens system, Fuji has other quality lenses out there which will mate with this camera."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0016955571481958032, 0.0006141223711892962, 0.0029061739332973957, 0.9578387141227722, 0.0009817410027608275, 0.0006458752322942019, 0.0005826607812196016, 0.0026300603058189154, 0.0026361120399087667, 0.0006133631686680019, 0.0019934268202632666, 0.0032039883080869913, 0.023658163845539093]]}
