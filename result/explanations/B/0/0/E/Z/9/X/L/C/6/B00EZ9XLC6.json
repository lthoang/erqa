It is very small, simple and intuitively straight forward to use. Simply plug it into a wall outlet, plug in your device and listen. There is no separate volume control - volume and any other settings are controlled by your device. In my case, I tested it with an iPhone, and it was better quality than most laptop or computer speakers. Perfect for a small or medium sized room. If you are looking for something portable, you just need to be prepared that this speaker option requires you to stay tethered to a power source. But if that is what you are looking for, for this price, you will have a very good speaker, with rich sound, both in the upper and lower register. Well recommended.", "\"Based on my previous experience with externally attached speakers, I wasn't expecting much from the LOGITECH MULTIMEDIA SPEAKER Z50.  However, once plugged in, the Z50 proved to be a pleasant surprise.The Z50 is a stand-alone cylindrical speaker with the size and heft of a baseball.  Weighted at the bottom, this solidly-built speaker does not slide around or get knocked over easily like most other speakers I have tried.  Setup is as simple as it gets:  one cord connects the speaker to an electrical outlet and another cord connects the speaker to any media device that accepts a 5mm jack ... that's it.While the true definition of sound \"\"quality\"\" varies from person to person, I believe the Z50 delivers above-average sound.  Added bass eliminates the cheap \"\"tinny\"\" sound that makes so many speakers sound like transistor radios.  The Z50 amplifies sound very well and there was no distortion or breaking-up when the device volume was maxed-out (that clinched it for me).  I occasionally run a guitar through my iPad via Garage Band/Amplitube apps and this is where the Z50's sound delivery really shined for me.While I appreciate the Z50's simple/no-nonsense design, there are a few things I found disappointing:- Volume is solely controlled by the device it's plugged into ... a volume control knob on the speaker would add convenience.- The speaker has no on/off switch and unplugging the speaker is the only way to turn it off.  Expect a hum and feedback if it's detached from the media device but remains plugged into the outlet.  I still think I'd prefer plugging/unplugging over the dealing with the expense/inconvenience of constantly replacing batteries.- Both the electrical and device cords are rather short, creating a portability issue.Aside from these relatively minor issues, I am still very impressed with the LOGITECH Z50 speaker and its ability to project clear and stable sound at higher volumes.\"", "First, understand that this speaker has to be plugged into a power outlet. It then take its input from any device that has a headphone jack. The good aspect of this speaker is that it is small, favors the high frequencies but has a solid base. But don't expect this to sound like a big speaker. It sounds better than you might expect from a tiny speaker, but the sound is not great.There are two things other than the sound, that bother me about this product. First, what is the purpose of this? Since you have to plug it into an outlet, it is not exactly portable. If you have to plug it in, why can't you just use a bigger system? Well, maybe you just like cute speakers. The other problem with this is that there is no dedicated volume control, so you must control the volume from the source device. If your mother yells at you to lower the volume, she will have to wait a few additional seconds for you to lower it, which might cost you your mother's freshly baked cake portion. Also, since this is only a single speaker, there is no stereo sound. All in all, you get what you pay for, but why not get a speaker pair?(Even Logitech offers a stereo pair for the same price with a volume control!) Or, spend a little more and get much better sound.", "I needed a small speaker that would be out of the way, produce good sound and not cost very much. The Logitech speaker accomplished those objectives. It has plenty of volume, no noticeable bass distortion and it has held up well in use.", "For years, I've been using various PC speakers to play my MP3 players, laptops, and other electronic devices through. I had a pair of labtec speakers back in the 90's to play my discman through. Yes, old-school. What always bothered me, though, was having two separate volume controls. I had to walk the delicate balancing act of increasing volume on both items to some sort of equilibrium, without using too much power from the device (leading to what seemed like higher battery drain) or too much from the speaker (leading to static noise).Thus, when I saw this device, it seemed too good to be true. I thought, &#34;surely it must have an internal battery that will wear out over time.&#34; Nope, it runs solely on AC power. Then I thought, &#34;surely it requires some weird audio adapter.&#34; Nope, it uses a standard headphone plug. So I took the gamble and bought it.If what you want is a simple speaker with no controls (not even a power switch) that you can plug into any normal headphone-style port, with enough volume to fill a normal-sized room (like a dorm room or living room), and you're not concerned about super-high audio quality or big bass tones, this is the speaker for you. It has a small form factor and footprint -- about the size of a spindle of 50 CD-R's, so if you have limited desk/counter space, it will serve you well. Again, it's not going to blow out the windows, and it's not going to satisfy audiophiles who spend hundreds of dollars on headphones. It will, however, serve to amplify your smartphone, mp3 player, laptop, or other standard audio device up to maximum volumes that are unlikely to hurt your ears.One thing -- if you're not picky about the color, check the prices on the different colors of them. I didn't care what color mine was, so I looked and saw that the pink one was cheaper than the others -- ten dollars cheaper than the gray one at the time I bought it.", "This little speaker has a great sound.  I already have wonderful speakers for my desk top computer that I am very happy with.  I wanted this little guy for my Toshiba Satellite Lap Top.I would have preferred the speaking be square or rectangular and that the base be as larger or larger than the top, but that may be a touch of OCD talking.This speaker, while I could play it with my laptop, would not be recognized by my system as a speaker, but wanted to call it a microphone.  Despite multiple attempts, following directions from several sources on line, I could never get it to play without the sound from my laptop speakers playing to.  They were perfectly synced so it was difficult to discern that you were listening to two sets of speakers.  But I found it irritating that I couldn't get it to perform the way it was designed to do.  If I disabled my lap top speakers, it also disabled output from the Logitech Speaker.I tried the Logitech with my HP Media Center Desk Top computer and it worked perfectly.  That fact and the fact that other reviewers have not mentioned any such problems with setting up this speaker makes me think the problem is with the laptop OS.  I have the A665 model laptop.While I might not like the physical design of the speaker all that much personally and I ran into issues with my laptop, this is a fine speaker otherwise.  It produces great sound for small a speaker and I would recommend it, particularly if you have a small space on your desk.", "We use this as a speaker that will be stationary, hooked up to an old android phone that is being used as a baby monitor with an IP camera.Since the phone is older, it has to be consistently charged as well.  We have a bluetooth speaker, but that requires a charge every 10 hours.  Having this guy be AC powered is just what we needed.", "This speaker is pretty tiny, but it sounds like something much bigger.  I was quite surprised to find that it doesn't even have a lot of buzz in bass-heavy songs, the handicap of most inexpensive speakers intended for use with your laptop or smartphone.  It's also nicely portable, just a bit larger than a can of soda, but its portability is hampered by the fact that you have to plug it in.  It doesn't use batteries at all, so you can't just chuck it in your bag and use it anywhere.  But if you just want a better-sounding speaker for your laptop and intend to leave it on your desk, it's a good value.", "\"Sometimes something is SO simple, that your brain skips right past it and tries to make it more complicated. Such was the case with this little speaker, that I fussed around with, off and on, for most of Sunday. I even got my husband and son involved and either we're a case of The Three Stooges or the instructions need to be more clarified.But, let's get to the speaker. GREAT sound, very light-weight, and a fantastic price point.Now, here comes the confusion. Quoting from the ad,\"\"Plug and play simplicity: Super-easy setup; Just plug the speaker into your device and start listening.\"\" I guess I took them too literally, because I plugged the jack into my devices and NOTHING came out! Had the ad stated, \"\"Just plug the power supply into a socket and then the speaker, then connect the jack to your device and start listening,\"\" I would have figured it out. Even the photo of the speaker on amazon shows only ONE cable leading off into the distance, not two: one being the jack and the other being the power cord.In my defense, I actually own two tiny speakers that have no battery supply (as this one also does not) and the supplied jack draws power off from your device to power it up. I thought that this Logitech speaker was designed with the same principle. It does not; it only operates when plugged simultaneously into the wall and your device.So, bottom line: if you are a person who always has a power strip next to your device and don't move from room to room, then this is a wonderful speaker for you, both on performance and price point. But, if you use your speaker like I do: listening to Pandora while I'm reading the recipe from my tablet and you need NO cords anywhere on the kitchen island, or you're in an airport/doctor's office streaming a movie and there's NO POWER around, or you're outside, gardening and moving about the garden, then this speaker will probably not work for you.\"", "This is an excellent little speaker.  I have several Logitech products and they are all of good quality.  At about twenty bucks it's  certainly not Bose, but it's also not the usual tinny cheap speakers like so many others at this price. It produces a pretty impressive  sound and even the bass is pretty good.  Wish it took batteries too but it doesn't.  I like using it with my iPhone while doing chores outside, or while at my workbench.  There's not much to this little guy, pretty much on/off and plug your device into it.  No separate volume controls, no frills, just an excellent small speaker that sounds much bigger than it looks.", "I really like the idea of a nice speaker that looks like a tiny, colorful flowerpot from the future.I bought one to use with my [floor-standing] desktop computer, with the goal of minimizing desk clutter while still sounding better than the disaster of a speaker that's built into my monitor. The speaker sounded fine but I ended up returning it in disappointment for two reasons. One, its input cable is attached permanently and is only ~2.5 feet long, so it didn't even reach my desk. I know I can buy an extension cable, but why should I have to, when I have plenty of longer 3.5mm cables around my house already?The second flaw is that the speaker doesn't have any volume control. No problem, right? Just change the volume on your phone or whatever, right? That's what I thought, but I overlooked one thing: no volume control = the volume is at 100% all the time. So when you handle the 3.5mm connector you hear all the associated pops, scratches, and hums at unsettling volume, and it also means the speaker makes faint electrical/white noise when it's supposed to be idle. It's very, very quiet, but still noticeable.Hopefully Logitech is listening and will make improvements to version 2, since I do like the idea of minimizing clutter without sacrificing too much sound quality."], "Gamma": [0.1838344782590866, 0.1838344782590866, 0.26466208696365356, 0.1838344782590866, 0.1838344782590866], "Beta": [[0.06814437359571457, 0.5369858145713806, 0.009277991019189358, 0.035160984843969345, 0.010363493114709854, 0.00011996916873613372, 0.02528173290193081, 0.08922392129898071, 0.012330002151429653, 0.2128150314092636, 0.0002967159089166671], [0.06814437359571457, 0.5369858145713806, 0.009277991019189358, 0.035160984843969345, 0.010363493114709854, 0.00011996916873613372, 0.02528173290193081, 0.08922392129898071, 0.012330002151429653, 0.2128150314092636, 0.0002967159089166671], [0.07215918600559235, 0.5672891736030579, 0.01125294528901577, 0.03596389293670654, 0.014527962543070316, 8.386371337110177e-05, 0.027409488335251808, 0.07552646845579147, 0.009732848964631557, 0.1857653260231018, 0.000288853858364746], [0.06814437359571457, 0.5369858145713806, 0.009277991019189358, 0.035160984843969345, 0.010363493114709854, 0.00011996916873613372, 0.02528173290193081, 0.08922392129898071, 0.012330002151429653, 0.2128150314092636, 0.0002967159089166671], [0.06814437359571457, 0.5369858145713806, 0.009277991019189358, 0.035160984843969345, 0.010363493114709854, 0.00011996916873613372, 0.02528173290193081, 0.08922392129898071, 0.012330002151429653, 0.2128150314092636, 0.0002967159089166671]]}
