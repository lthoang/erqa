"], "reviews": ["I have to agree with the other reviewers and state that these soups are bland. It's great that they're gluten-free and the packaging is not only attractive and handily compact, but you can recycle the glass jars or reuse them as food storage containers. But none of the positive aspects of the product can make up for the fact that the soups just aren't flavorful enough to bother with. There are better, healthy soups on the market so there's no reason to get these.", "The Bookbinder's soups are delicious and oh so convenient!!  They are truly heat and eat...nothing to mix or add and the flavors are delish!!  They come in jars so you can see what tempts the eye.  They are so easy when taking to work to pop into the microwave for a hot, tasty lunch.  Mine came from Amazon and the only problem with them is deciding which to eat first. There are six flavors and it appears the one I am eating is my favorite...maybe the zesty tomato is my true favorite...but then the butternut squash was so yummy and the potato leek was reminiscent of my mother's soup...Cuban black bean is zesty and spicy for extra cold days...oh you just have to try them to find your favorite.Bookbinder's Gourmet Vegetable Soup Assortment, 6 Count (Pack of 6)", "Coming from the Eastern Seaboard I was drawn by the name &#8220;Bookbinders&#8221; brand.  I was very familiar and a two time customer of the original Bookbinder&#8217;s Restaurant in Philly. These soups were hit and miss with me as a collection.  I&#8217;d personally buy a whole carton of the Butternut Squash and Mushroom soup.  It was rich and smooth and very tasty.The Potato-Leek soup, on the other hand, tasted neither of potatoes or leeks.  What was worse was the odd off-putting consistency.  The Cuban Black Bean had a good taste but it could have used a tad more heat in the spices.The three tomato based selections (Tuscan Minestrone, Zesty Tomato and Sicilian Tomato-Zucchini) were all quite good.  A few of the reviewers said the tastes were bland but I think that may have been because there is a little less sodium than you usually find in the current canned favorites found on Supermarket shelves.These are not condensed so the 15 ounce jars are what you get.  Some of these varieties list 3 servings per jar as a portion that is only 5 ounces of soup which may not be enough for a main course.  At over $5.00 per jar I feel you could go to your favorite eatery for lunch and get a better deal.", "This collection includes six glass jars, each 15 ounces, of either vegetarian or vegan soup or bisque.  The jars all state the products are all natural, gluten free, have no trans fat, no artificial additives or preservatives.  There is also the statement that a portion of the profits help feed less fortunate in Philadelphia.  The products are made in Pennsylvania.  I will mention each soup individually with a list of some of the ingredients, perhaps not in the exact order listed on the jar, but I will not list things like water or a mirepoix of carrot, celery, onion, sea salt, and onion powder which is in the soups.  These soups would definitely be good for anyone on a low sodium diet.  If I was having a sandwich or salad with the soup they were fine, but if I was eating the soup alone I had to add salt.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND MUSHROOM soup, vegetarian, 3 servings of 1/2 cup each per jar, 120 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  butternut squash puree, mushrooms, heavy cream, onion, olive oil, honey, salt, curry powder, black pepper.  This was smooth, but with large, recognizable pieces of mushrooms, slightly sweet.  This was excellent! 5 star!  So good I passed on the sandwich and ate the whole jar.  Not bad at all for a 360 calorie lunch.ZESTY TOMATO soup, vegetarian, 3 servings of 1/2 cup each per jar, 40 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  tomatoes, onion, olive oil, jalapeno pepper, salt, ginger, sugar, cumin, calcium chloride, modified corn starch.  Excellent taste, 5 star, not hot, just a little heat to make it interesting.  Chunky consistency so you need a spoon to eat it, with pieces large enough to require some chewing.  I had this whole jar for lunch, with nothing else, for 120 calories.CUBAN BLACK BEAN soup, vegan, 2 servings of 1 cup each per jar, 120 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  black beans, corn, roasted red peppers, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, parsley.  Very good taste, 4 star, medium thickness requiring some chew, does not seem to separate in the jar.SICILIAN TOMATO-ZUCCHINI bisque, vegetarian, 2 servings of 1 cup each per jar, 90 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  tomatoes, zucchini, roasted red peppers, Chablis wine, heavy cream, onions, celery, carrots, garlic, basil, soybean oil, salt, pepper.  Very good taste, 4 star, thick crushed vegetables so it can be either spooned or drunk from a cup.IRISH POTATO-LEEK soup, vegetarian, 2 servings of 1 cup each per jar, 160 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  potatoes, water, leeks, heavy cream, thyme.  Did not like, 1 star!  Bland flavor and yet a heavy lingering aftertaste of the leeks.TUSCAN MINESTRONE soup, vegan, 2 servings of 1 cup each per jar, 80 calories per serving.  Main ingredients:  white beans, zucchini, onion, bell peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic.  This I didn't like at all, 1 star!  It has a very thin, weak broth and the white beans were so hard they almost had a crunch to them, very bland.A convenient way to buy soups, especially for a school/work environment, but I would want to pick the varieties and not just get an assortment offered by the manufacturer.", "\"Just a quick edit to add that my son, who is not lactose intolerant tried the Irish Potato-leek and although Potato soup is one of his favorites, he very much disliked this soup. He said the main taste of the Irish Potato-leek soup was sour!Our overall impression of the soups? It will probably be inflicted on a food drive if you gave this to someone as a gift.I actually thought about saying all sizzle and no steak, but since this is a vegetable soup assortment,  I managed to restrain myself.First up, just to get this out of the way, none of the jars contain a full two or three servings. One of the things that I want to do when reviewing a food is see how it ranks as far as nutrition. Four of the soups have two servings per jar, and as I tend to do math in my head (easy math only!),  my internal \"\"this does not compute\"\" alarm went off when I noticed that all of the jars  contain 15 ounces, or 425 grams. For the sake of ease and clarity, I will use grams when describing serving sizes.  A 425 gram jar allegedly contains two 245 gram servings. Unless there has been some warping of the time space continuum that nobody told me about, I am pretty sure you can't get 490 grams of soup into a 425 gram capacity jar.The jars for the Zesty Tomato and the Butternut Squash Mushroom are the only two with a smaller serving size, 149 grams, so the jar almost contains three servings, falling only 22 grams short of the 447 three 149 gram servings should add up to.Two of the soups, Cuban Black Bean and Tuscan Minestrone are vegan, the other four are vegetarian. The Butternut Squash Mushroom and the Irish Potato Leek contain Heavy Cream, since I am very lactose intolerant, I did not try those two as Heavy Cream is a high lactose food.Visually, the two least appealing are the Irish Potato Leek, sort of a queasy green,  and the Cuban Black Bean, the color of, for the sake of innocent eyes, I am not even going to try to describe.None of the soups are low in sodium, the Butternut Squash Mushroom actually claims it is low salt (aka sodium) on the label, but comes in at 15% DV for a half cup (149 gram) serving.The smaller serving sizes of two of the soups also seem to be a bit arbitrary, other than keeping the sodium DV of the  Zesty Tomato under 30%, since it is only 40 calories per 149 gram serving. However, without the smaller (149 Gram) serving size, the  calories of the Butternut Squash Mushroom would be approx 180, with a hefty 37% saturated fat.I will only describe the Cuban Black Bean in individual detail, as it was the healhiest overall. with 120 calories per serving, 20% DV of fiber, but still the average 25% sodium. I have to admit not being familar with Cuban cooking, but reading the wiki told me that\"\"\"\"Cuban cuisine\"\" offers distinct taste with rampant use of citrus (i.e. sourorange, lime, lemon), tomato, vinegar, onion, garlic, peppers, white wine orbeer (depending on region and dish), raisins and olives/capers to flavor almostevery savory dish. This combination of flavor often results in complex andflavorful meals with opposing sweet vs. salty vs. acidic components\"\"While heating it up, it smelled pretty good, vaguely like the thicker version of tortillasoup made with mexican spices, but upon tasting it, my first impression was basically bland, and the only flavor I could really taste was \"\"sour\"\". I did eat the whole jar by myself, since 15 ounces is actually a smaller serving than the 19 ounce (538 gram) can, approx 2 servings (140 calorie per 243 grams),  of Progesso Soup (Split Pea and Ham) that I would have eaten instead if I was not testing this product. Overall, not really impressed, and even after eating the whole jar, with two slices of toasted sour-dough bread, I was still hungry, as opposed to eating a can of Progresso soup and actually feeling like I had something for my dinner.There really seems to be no real advantage to buying these soups, yes they are all gluten free, but one of my favorite Progresso soups, Split Pea and Ham is also gluten free. Amy's has much better tasting Vegan soups that are also gluten free, with better nutrition, less sodium, fat, and no cholesterol. Amy's makes soups that are actually Non-GMO 100% Organic, as opposed to the vague all-natural, that taste better than any the soups in this collection.As far as total fat and sat fat, even the Split Pea Progresso soup had  lower fat (4% DV, 0 sat fat) than  half of these Bookbinder \"\"Gourmet\"\" soupsThis falls under those things that sounds like a good idea, maybe send a box to aunt Edna for a holiday present, well if your hypothetical aunt Edna needs to watch her sodium or her fat intake, you might want to reconsider that, unless, hypothetically speaking, you were her only heir. I'm just kidding by the way, my brain got stuck in smarty pants mode today, that tends to be my personal way of venting my frustration (as opposed to road rage) to spending an hour in traffic with a large number of other drivers that apparently think they are stunt drivers for a movie featuring a lot of car crashes.\"", "A bit on the bland side, and some of the flavors seem to &#34;overlap&#34; - in a pack of six, maybe a bit too much tomato? but - these are super convenient, nicely packaged in glass (healthier and reusable), and the ingredients are fairly wholesome. Keeping on the shelf for emergency meals, particularly as some are vegetarian and some are vegan - very handy if you're having company and find out someone has food restrictions. Overall I'd recommend, but you may need to jazz them up a bit with extra herbs, spices, oil drizzles, whatever.", "\"Bookbinders Heat and Serve Soups:I had never heard of this brand before, and I love soups, so I was interested to see what these were like. According to their website, Bookbinders Old Restaurant is a well-established restaurant in Philadelphia, PA. These soups and other items are from the popular dishes served at the restaurant. If you have a busy life, these are ready to heat and eat, or as one teen said, eat out of the jar. They are a great, fast meal or mid-day healthy snack.With that said, I was not especially thrilled with all of the choices in this package of six different soups, but most of them were fine. These are all bottled in glass jars and are two or three servings (or one hearty serving). The calories vary from 60 per serving to 160. Some are made with heavy cream, so people with milk sensitivity could not eat them, but not all are this way. These soups are American made, and the labels say \"\"natural and gluten free, no artificial additives or preservatives\"\". Some are noted as \"\"vegetarian\"\" and some are \"\"vegan\"\" depending on the cream content.  See below:1) The worst was the Irish Potato-Leek soup. I love potato-leek soup, so I was really, really disappointed to have to throw this out. There is nothing on the list of ingredients that I have not had before and loved, but somehow, this tasted horrible. It had an overpowering taste of musty leaves - not spoiled, but a taste of old seasonings. Maybe they were too heavy-handed on something. It is vegetarian, 2 one-cup servings, and 160 calories per cup.2) The next on the list is the Butternut Squash and Mushroom soup. It was okay. There is no listing of flour (noted as gluten free), but it had an odd taste that reminded me of flour. It is 3 -cup servings, 120 calories per serving, has heavy cream, and is vegetarian.3) The Tuscan Minestrone is a great soup with excellent flavor. It is vegan, 2 one-cup servings of 80 calories each. It is one of my favorite soups in the group, and great for the weight wise person.4) The Cuban Black Bean soup is also good, but I expected it to have a little spice to it since the name says \"\"Cuban\"\"; however, there is no heat or spice, which may be fine for most people. This is a vegan soup, has 2 one-cup servings, and 120 calories per serving.5) The Zesty Tomato soup is another favorite of mine. It has great flavor and is vegetarian. It is 3 -cup servings with only 40 calories per serving. So for the weight wise person, this is an excellent choice.6) The Sicilian Tomato-Zucchini soup is another favorite of mine. It has excellent taste, it is vegetarian, it has 2 one-cup servings at 90 calories each, so it is another great weight wise offering. It has heavy cream for those who need to know.Finally, these soups also support their community as each container says, \"\"a portion of the profits will help feed the less fortunate in Philadelphia\"\".\"", "\"My wife and I are soup lovers and have the cupboard constantly stocked with canned soups, especially Progresso, which puts out consistently good soups. We were eager to try this Bookbinder's assortment. The soups were well packaged. This is important since they come in jars, not cans. A thick box with cardboard separators held the soups firmly in place. The soups looked great and we were eager to try them.The first one we tried was Irish Potato-Leek. This one was terribly disappointing. It was extremely bland and had the faintest flavor. Hardly a winner in our book.The next night we tried the Sicilian Tomato Zucchini. This was better, but not by much. There was a stronger flavor, but we still had to add salt and lots of black pepper to give the soup some life. So far, we were unimpressed with this brand.The third time, we had the Tuscan Minestrone. This was the best of the three, though we agreed that it didn't come up to Progresso's Minestrone. It was pleasant enough, but required a sprinkle of grated cheese to make it come to life. A good soup should stand on its own and shouldn't have to have lots of seasonings and flavorings added after it is cooked.We haven't had the other three soups in the assortment yet, but thus far, we are disappointed and would not seek these soups out again. They are merely routine, and for the price being charged, are definitely overpriced. Over $5 is far too costly for a jar that serves two people.If you're into \"\"natural\"\" foods, these soups make that claim, but be aware that you will be getting far from the best soup you ever tasted.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12249702215194702, 0.12636522948741913, 0.11864562332630157, 0.10872207581996918, 0.12067684531211853, 0.13503509759902954, 0.13833679258823395, 0.12972131371498108]]}
