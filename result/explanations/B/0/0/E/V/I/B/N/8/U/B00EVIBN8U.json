We went ice skating and having hands free was a must to capture on ice shots. My wife and three year old went horseback riding. The only way for her to record was with this.Very impressed with video quality. Both indoors and out. On the 170 degree option the sides are curved and distorted, but otherwise great quality.The clip and band works well but there is also an accessary to turn it into a more conventional camcorder.For action enthusiasts this will give you great video quality. And anyone wanting hands free recording, this is also highly recommended.", "This camera is so close to being the best in the industry but it's got some serious missed features to make it great.Lets start with the GOOD:Image Stabilization: It's the only sports camera on the market that has image stabilization, this is outstanding!!!Small form Factor: the camera itself is really small compared to other cameras (but*** keep reading)simple menus for easy adjustment from the side of camera with it's included screen and buttons on the side.remote management: you can change settings remotely over WiFi but the options are limited.Now to the BAD:The lens is not rotatable: Contour(no longer in busines) and Drift (best on the market, IMO) really hit the features when they made the camera rotatable.No mount on the camera: the camera has no way to mount it so no matter what you have to use a housing of some kind, utter FAILWiFi: Sucks power like crazy... Also limited ability to change setting for the camera. You can only change camera recording rates and angle of view. other settings like time lapse cant be adjusted and setting like flip have to be done from the side of camera. This is quite the pain when all the settings should be adjustable from the app.Not able to select center point metering or change any metering setting at all, though the stock setting is pretty decent it would be nice to be able to make adjustments.Microphone settings not adjustable.Lousy location for mic, not accessible inside the case that it comes with (you can't drill through either because then you'll damage the locking lever that closes the case. You have to buy a goofy offset housing that then gives you access to the ports on the bottom of the camera. Even the optional screen case doesn't allow access to the microphone port... It really should be offset on the back of the camera like the Drift cameras did.HEAT: This camera gets ridiculously HOT after only running for a short time, say 30 minutes. It seems rather clear to me that they are running the internals at either an over clocking level or have just not provided the proper heat sinking that should be had in a device like this. It seems very odd that other devices like the Ghost camera can run so much cooler and performs nearly the same. Though I might have to say this has a bit better night time visibility but the heat production of this camera is just astounding. Depending on the conditions the camera will actually shut down and stop recording because it has gotten so hot. I have worked with a number of other sports/action cameras and none have gotten as hot as this one. I used it indoors during Christmas morning with the family mounted with a couple rubber bands to a bracket on the wall for a light and after an hour it shut off from getting too hot. WiFi was turned off before beginning recording as well, and it was the camera alone, no case on it. When I noticed it had shut off I took it down but it was so hot that I couldn't even hold on to it.While this camera has some awesome points like it's video quality, image stabilization, built in mic, and several other options it's got a lot of downfalls as well. Even still, if you want superior video quality then this is really the camera you should consider because it's image quality and image-stabilization make it an outstanding device I just wish it wasn't lacking is the other areas because then it would truly be the top camera on the market...UPDATE the firmware: this gives you a FLIP option that allows you to slip the video 180 degrees in the camera so the camera can be mounted upside down and still give you the right perspective/angle of video.If you like to mount a camera to your motorcycle and don't want to get vibration from the revs of the bike I would highly recommend this for that but remember you will need to adjust the angle of the video by adjusting the angle of the camera as the lens can not rotate to change the angle.Sony, you have an outstanding start here but please, take some strong notes from the leaders in the market like Drift and others that have so much more function in their cameras for the user to be able to make the adjustments they need to.", "I played with Sony's HDR-AS30V and its accessories for a few hours, then took it with me (in its optional camcorder case) to videotape, and take photos for, a Christmas party. This is a nice little video camera as long as you are clear on what it's going to be used for. It's really not a replacement for a digital camera.First, the accessories: Sony was kind enough to send me the camcorder cradle, wrist band mount, head band mount, and tripod angle mount to test with the HDR-AS30V, along with a package of the pretty essential anti-fog sheets. The video camera itself comes with a waterproof casing for underwater filming. The camera sits inside this case, but you can take it out to put it in the camcorder cradle instead (which is not waterproof, of course). In its waterproof casing, the video camera mounts well on any of the mounts. I tested the wrist mount on my chiweenie puppy (7 lbs.) but he didn't like it very much and it rolled around. On me, it's fine, also, but I don't do anything that would warrant my using it. The head mount has a wide band that fit to my head securely, but I don't do things with a helmet on so I couldn't test how it works for that.Before I left for the Christmas party, I charged up the battery and replaced the 8GB SDHC card that came with my video camera with a 32GB one. I spent about half an hour with the video camera in Interval/5-second mode snapping photos and about 45 minutes non-stop videotaping activity. I really wasn't happy with the quality of the photos, however. I thought I had set the camera to its highest quality mode, but apparently I had not. I wound up with a lower-resolution appearance to the photos that really don't look all that good even onscreen. Another thing I did not like is the fisheye-like distortion at the edges, warped-looking (bent) walls and doors, and an odd color cast. Like I said, this camera is not a replacement for a digital camera.What the HDR-AS30V shines at, though, is precisely what it's made for: rapid action shots from the perspective of the wearer. The video camera has good stability and the fisheye effect enhances the (for lack of a better word) intimacy of the action shots. The GPS capability and log is a really geeky thing that could even have some diagnostic utility for sports people. All in all, it's a lot of capability in a very tiny package that won't weigh or slow you down.To be honest, I'm not likely to do much in the realm of action shots. I did find the camcorder case to be very lightweight and easy to use over several hours of time without fatigue. The battery held up during that time, and so did the 32GB storage. Extra batteries can be purchased cheaply, so you can always be ready to go. When I got back home from my party, it was just a matter of plugging in the USB cable into my computer and importing all my photos and movies using the PlayMemories software. I wouldn't give up Photoshop for PlayMemories, but it serves the purpose of importation well enough.I think what I enjoy the most with this video camera is taking slo-mo shots of my puppy running around, tearing the throat out of his floppy dog, etc. The slow-motion and slow-slow motion modes take more juice, though, so it's good to have an extra charged battery on hand.", "The HDR-AS30V WiFi takes excellent still, slow motion, and action shots with easy-to-use function buttons. The  11.9 megapixel camera captures great video and the mic picks up little wind noise making the videos that much better. This camera is small and hooks to the wrist, helmet, and even a dog's harness with ease.  Hands down,  much better camera than the other action cameras  on the market.I recently took the camera to the LA auto show and the steady cam feature was amazing.  I walked around filming and when I reviewed the footage- the quality and steadiness of the picture was awesome.  There was no blur or shaking in the picture.Possibly the best feature is the WiFi connection for Smartphone.  Finally an action cam that I can actually see what I am videoing without filming and reviewing the shots to come up with the best angle. Now, I hook up the camera to my Smartphone and I instantly see exactly what the camera is filming.So light, you will forget the camera is there!", "This camera has overall better performance and features than the current industry leader. It's even priced about 100 bucks cheaper (at the time this review was written) than the competition. Some things I love about it are the included waterproof case, removable, battery, image stabilization, slow-motion video capture,  decent low light performance, SD Card (and memory stick) compatible, built-in GPS and a wide array of available accessories (for example, there's an add on accessory AKA-LU1 that is an LCD screen with hand-grip). It is amazing how many features they were able to fit onto this small camera.As with any device, there are things that need some improvements.  Although the battery life is similar to the 'industry standard'... I am still left feeling that it could be better. Luckily, they did make the battery removable so you can buy extras and carry some with you.  Also, I wished they would have included the remote instead of making it an accessory you have to buy.I conclude that this Action Cam from Sony deliveries lots of bang for your buck. If you're looking for a high resolution action cam that include tons of features for an affordable price, you should definitely consider this camera.", "For the first time, GoPro has some serious competition. But let's get one thing out of the way: GoPro Hero camera's plastic weather cover is far superior; you could take it to 80' depth in your next dive, but not the Sony's. I would be comfortable using the Sony in the rain, not even for swimming. Other than that, the Sony AS-30V is excel in virtually every category.I used these action cams mostly when I ride my bicycle. I used them to capture videos of new places, rides in spring when flowers bloom. I took them in my diving trip or camping. So I have high standard for video quality. The Hero 3 does a great job, but video quality is not something worth bragging about. Now the Sony sort of making me leave the GoPro home.The AS-30V is awesome in low light. I took the first test video on my bike ride, the day was cloudy and wet, and I did not expect good result, just enough to write this review. Then when I got home and downloaded the video, what a pleasant surprise!! 1080p video is awesome, sharp with great color saturation. And this was with no tweaking, just right of the box. I guess on my next test, I will capture the same scene with both cameras for a fair comparison. But for right now, the Sone AS-30V is my favorite!The whole evaluation kit consists of several accessories: hand held grip with LCD screen (most important and useful), several mounts for arm band and helmet..I tested the hand held grip and you could almost feel like you are holding a full video camera. Far better than the LCP back of GoPro.The camera has an extensive feature set, so is the menu set. But menu features are set up logically, so I believe I could learn and get use to it quickly. I only set up date/time, load the provide 8GB MicroSD card and go. I have since replaced the card with  a 32GB. 8GB can get you about 2hrs of video. When I added the 32GB card, the display shows that there are 4hr 40 min. of video. I guess that how long the  battery will last. I may need to get an extra battery, just incase.Sony provides a free app, PlayMemories Home, so you can import the videos from your camera. You could just copy them directly from the camera when you plug in a computer, but that seems like the only way to take advantage of all features of the camera.I have not tested the WiFi option, it seems pretty straight forward. But I CAN NOT get the GPS data overlay to work, so a call to Sony technical services is in order. Despite of this,  I still love the camera enough to give it 5 stars.", "This action cam is so tiny and so powerful!  We haven't had a new camera in some time, so when it arrived I was a little surprised at how diminutive it was!  It came with a waterproof case and we also got the AKA-LU1 handheld grip with LCD screen, which turns this little camera into more of a traditional camera with a view screen.Out of the box it was not very intuitive on how to set this up and start using it.  It only has a few buttons- but I did have to read the instructions on how to turn it on and off, go through the set up, how to correctly charge, and how to take video.  I still have not figured out how to set up the wi-fi and connect it with my smartphone and set up the GPS, but perhaps that will be a job I leave to my spouse!  I don't figure it will be so hard, but I don't like reading directions!This thing seems to take really clean, clear video, I think we could use this as our primary camera as well as an action cam.The image stabilization is SPECTACULAR.  My spouse has shaky hands, and we have kids that will probably want to use this to capture all their outdoor activities and so having that work well is a must.  We have always gotten Sony brand products in the past for that feature and this one doesn't disappoint either.This camera is just a great value for the price.  I'll add more as I get more familiar with the particular quirks and advantages this camera has!+++EDIT+++ used it a bit more over the holidays.  One thing to note, WATCH YOUR SETTINGS CAREFULLY.  WE filmed an entire video accidentally in slow motion and didn't realize it until viewing it later on.", "I returned this product after realizing that it's not a big enough upgrade from the AS15 to justify spending the money. Saw the white 2014 version at CES and Sony fixed the flaky door which keeps opening so may splurge on that one when available. Either way, Sony's action cams are much better than the GoPro.", "This camera is a ton of fun, although a bit pricey.  It is dependable and has a ton of accessories.  I have attached it to my helmet and it takes great videos, although, I find most of them to just take up disk space because I will not go back and watch them.However, for any road incident on a bicycle, this could literally save you from much difficulty by demonstrating evidence in your favor, so I highly recommend getting one because things are getting more difficult for bikers and accidents, incidents with authorities, and just general demand to review anything that may have happened to you on a particular day or time could be invaluable to anyone.If you bike regularly, I would ensure I have it.  Most bicyclists go through their entire lives without incident, but once you have one, you will want to know what the heck happened or evidence if you need it.", "The sony camera takes great video and has a fantastic assortment of accessories to fit any activity. Most people are probably looking at this camera as a fitness or weekend warrior. I am using this camera as a training tool. My work has me create training videos for a wide range of outdoor and jobsite training processes. This camera has allowed me to take first person video of amny tasks and often the absolute expert in the field is the one taking the video. I am able to either use a head strap, or a helmet / hard hat mount. One it is on and running, the process of running through the process, is a wonderful example of the versatility and power of this type of camera.The camera is small and is very light weight. It takes high definition shots and the &#34;steady shot&#34; feature works great.I have not used the &#34;go pro&#34; camera, so this review is only using the sony.The sony is easy to use, has a plethora of accessories, works great, has fantastic sony image quality, and is easy to use. The learning curve is not bad and within an hour or two I had it running.This technology is still somewhat new and non-techie folks will have a harder time working this tech compared to a point and shoot camera ...although this is pretty close ... :)if you are looking to capture first person video, then this device rocks. it does a great job. I am also sure that depending on your sport or goal, you will also find the accessory you need to film your project.", "I have had this camera for around a month now.  I have never owned a GoPro so I cannot compare this Sony with a GoPro.  The camera comes with a waterproof case.  There also many add-ons you can purchase for this camera.  I have used the hand hold attachment, which allows you to use the camera as a regular hand held camera with a flip screen. I get between 2 1/2 and 3 hours of recording, which is more than enough for what this camera is intended for.I have used the camera while riding my bike. The video quality is excellent. The image stabilization and having the ability to record at higher fps keeps the video smooth. The GPS overlay is a nice feature to have.The NFC really make this camera shine.  I can pull up the video from the camera on the Samsung S4.  You can down the Sony NFC and play memories apps from the Google play store. Once synced the video can be controlled on my phone.I am looking forward to getting more use with the camera.  If the initial impression is changed based on more usage I will update my review.  I am considering purchase the Sony RM-LVR1 Live-View Remote but for now my phone works.", "I bought this camera to compare with my Hero Black version. Sony has a GPS which the GoPro lacks. Sony also has a better image stabilisation. In all remaining areas, GoPro is ahead of the Sony. I cannot mount Sony upside down (I have to correct the orientation later on during edit) or adjust its angle like I can with the GoPro. Sony's WiFi connection with the mobile application was a lot more finickier and the mobile application is limited compared to GoPro. Sony does not have a remote control like the GoPro. GoPro's remote that I can wear it as a watch makes a huge difference to be able to control the camera and gives me a feedback about the status of the camera.", "Awesome little action camera. Don't let the form factor (shaped like a traditional video camera) scare you off. The HDR-ASR30V is really tiny! Since other reviewers have complained about not being able to flip the camera upside down and still use GPS and overlays correctly I want to point out that firmware 2.00 released in November now offers the Flip function!Pros+ Great performance in daylight and low light+ Image stabilization+ Wifi and NFC (I'm an iOS user so only tried WiFi)+ GPS+ Interval, Photo, and Movie modes. As well as 2 and 4X slow modes+ Live view available via the Sony PlayMemories Mobile app. App offers settings for adjusting viewing angle and start/stop+ Uses the same batteries as my RX100M2+ Lots of affordable Sony accessories available+ Simple, intuitive, and straightforward menus. Wow. I'm shocked!+ Affordable+ GPS and overlay can be used with camera flipped in either direction. This is important because depending on how you attach the camera it may often be upside down (e.g. car windshield)Cons- Camera itself and housing don't feel that rugged and I haven't been inspired to test the limits", "The Sony HDR-AS30V is a typical Sony product - amazing list of features, but entirely overengineered. Let's start with the basics - video quality - this is something it just excels at - amazing quality, albeit with some quesitonable color choices. Still, it is very much in line with the other top of the line units. One thing it lacks is the 4K recording found on the new GoPro - but honestly, I've seen its footage, and it just isn't something the average user will need.Included in the package is the camera (screwed onto its base), a battery, waterproof case, a variety of very basic mounts and a USB cable. It charges off MicroUSB. The pad with inputs is on the bottom and is quite impressive; USB/Multi (with support for the new Multi port wired remote), MicroHDMI, Audio in and a second multi-style port for the camcorder accessory.Operation is quite easy (IMHO  easier than on the GP's). Turn it on, and use the 2 control buttons to scroll through settings. Use the record button to select. Alternatively, you can pair with it using NFC on a compatible phone, and change the settings using WiFi on your phone. Keep in mind that on the newer Samsung devices you will need to disable the mobile/wifi auto switch setting or your phone will not connect.Once connected, frame rate is acceptable - it does buffer and drop a bit, but it is decent enough. WiFi is an added extra on som GP unit. GPS is overlaid on the video and embedded on the SD card. Like other HD cameras, video is hidden away in a Bluray style folder layout.Audio inside the case is muffled, but that is to be expected.One highlight of the product is the AKA-LU1 camcorder grip (Sony AKA LU1 Camcorder HDR AS10 HDR AS15) which turns the camera into a real camcorder, complete with LCD display. At $56, this is a no-brainer.Sadly, the LiveView remote is currently nowhere to be found, so you are stuck using your smartphone for the moment. This remote is expected to be out before Christmas for $149.The other list of available accessories is quite impressive;SD and M2 memory cardsAC adapterHelmet mount packHandlebar mountsuction cup mounttilt adapterheadband/goddle adapterball head mount3 different battery charger kitschest mountdog mountfloatcarrying caseliveview remoterollbar mountwired remote (multi-port)surfboard mountskeleton frame mountwrist strapIn other words - a good copy of what GoPro offers - all for pretty similar prices. At $249 (the current price as of 11/24), this is a great deal. WiFi, GPS, NFC and a good 11MP sensor make for a solid package.Coming back to the overengineered part - an example; mounts for this come wrapped in foam, in a cardboard overwrap, inside a box inside another box. GoPro just pops them in a plastic bag and hangs them on a shelf. Sony could learn something from them.", "This camera is really nice, but like pretty much everything Sony does, a bit overthought and over engineered.  It's nice that it is possible to get a number of accessories for things like underwater use, but it is also a bit complex.  We do especially appreciate the water proof housing. Because it is a bit cold now, we haven't had a chance to use the helmet mount, be we are looking forward to it.", "The AS30V is  blast to use, durable, and small enough to attach to you or ride without getting in the way. What made me quickly come to like it, though, is the excellent quality of its video output. The first thing I did was hold it out my car window during a snowy commute to work. The resulting video was gorgeous. The Carl Zeiss lens really does make a difference. The SteadyShot mode smoothed things out without ruining the video quality.Cool features:2x and 4x slow motion. In a well lit environment, the slow motion is beautiful. It's not super slow but can really catch amazing footage.WiFi: it does require the Sony Play Memories software to use, but with it, I can operate basic camera controls with my Nexus 5.The Housing: I find the waterproof housing very easy to use. It easily and quickly opens and closes. I try not to protect the camera as much as possible but it has, inevitably, taken some shocks and gotten soaking wet. Both the case and the camera held up as expected.", "\"The Sony HDR-AS30V is the first Point of View (POV) camera I've ever owned and Wow! I'm blown away by all of the features this tiny camera has. (And I'm not joking when I say tiny - it measures 3 1/8\"\" x 1 7/8\"\" x 7/8\"\" and weighs less than 5oz!)So Point of View means a video camera, usually rather small, designed to be worn on the body during active sports or activities or travel that will record what you are seeing. This one does that and so much more. It's records in full-HD resolution, as well as lesser resolutions. It even records in Slow-Mo, which is one of my kids' favorites! You can also take still pictures, which is a nice option to have although it won't replace a regular digital still camera, IMO. It even comes with a waterproof case that will allow you to film in wet or even underwater locations (up to 16 ft. depth)! It has image stabilization that takes the shakes out of your video (works perfectly) and it features GPS.Sony has built a huge amount of flexibility into this camera through their PlayMemories app, their wide range of optional accessories and its wifi and NFC capabilities. I can't imagine any sport or activity that you couldn't easily use this camera to capture.In the box is the camera, the waterproof case, USB to MicroUSB cable, two adhesive surface mounts (flat and curved), a Quick-release clip, and of course, an owner's manual. Which brings me to my only major complaint - the owner's manual. If you've ever purchased a Sony electronics product, you will recognize this manual. It's tiny, hard to read print on a big sheet of very thin, folded, natural colored paper. The manual contents, however, are well written. I just hope one day Sony will consider a larger font and thicker, white paper as a nod toward an aging population.I copied the manual immediately onto thicker paper. You'll need to refer to it quite a bit initially as you learn how to access different menus, access the wifi mode, etc. Also, in the manual is an adhesive tape that includes the SSID and the password for the wifi feature. Place this in a safe place and preferably, copy the info in a couple of places because you will need the password.On the camera itself, there is a tiny LCD screen with two buttons labeled PREV and NEXT next to it. You turn the camera on/off and access all of the menus using those 2 buttons. On the butt end of the camera, there are two buttons labeled ENTER and REC HOLD. You also access the camera battery and SD card by pushing the butt end of the camera to the side until it swings up and open. On the bottom of the camera is a plastic door which snaps open to reveal HDMI out port, an external microphone jack, a microUSB port and a proprietary expansion connector.The fixed lens on the camera is a wide angle lens, great for capturing every bit of the action when filming extreme sports. It does give still pics a different look, which is why it won't replace a digital still camera, but I love the lens.Sony's free PlayMemories Mobile app is a way for you to control the camera as well as watch what's being recorded real time on your smartphone. It worked instantly with my iPhone 4S and my iPad 3.Sony also has an impressive array of accessories that let you get the most of this camera for your particular needs. There are head mounts, helmet mounts that are tiltable, wrist mounts, and even a case that features a swing out, color LCD screen so that it functions as a conventional hand-held video cam (I LOVE this accessory).The resolution is absolutely stunning! I find nothing wanting in the video quality and I marvel every time that such gorgeous video comes from such a tiny camera. Also, the image stabilization performs flawlessly - a huge plus in a POV camera. Granted, I am not a professional photographer or even an amateur photographer. I'm a mom with 5 very active boys who is delighted to be able to finally capture reliably their active pursuits.Battery life is nothing spectacular. I get about 2 hours on a fully charged battery so my first purchase was 2 more batteries and an external charger. It's fast and easy to swap a spent battery for a fresh one and if you intend to use the wifi, you'll need the extra batteries because wifi drains the battery fast.I think at about $300, this camera is a marvel and I'm tickled pink with it!\""], "Gamma": [0.03484411910176277, 0.001512322574853897, 0.034844912588596344, 0.034844912588596344, 0.034844912588596344, 0.0347912572324276,
