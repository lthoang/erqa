I bought these because they came with bud attachments that are meant to keep the buds in place. There are different sizes and I I have yet to have them fall out even during workouts. Once I found the right size and attachment, they fix great without any pain. The sound is also great. I could ask for better sound other than buying highly expensive speakers. It also has a mic for use with phones and the ability to change tracks. A must buy.", "OK, third pair of buds.... I just cant wear a headset for an extended period of time, because I wear glasses., I have been a musician all my life as well as an Engineer by trade, so music is a big part of my life. I never accept second best, and always strive to buy the best. My experience has been that price doesn't always mean It's  the best.... Every bud I tried, after a brief time would slowly slide back out of my ear canal and I would lose the bass depth. I read all the reviews and because I have a JLab sub, thought I would trust the name. I like them so much that I bought a set for my mate. Both of us experienced the same fit right out of the box... They come packaged with a mid size that worked for both of us... no issues- even after hours of wear. comfortable fit.... OK, now to the sound- OMG- forget it- buy these... the bass is all there without boomyness, the highs are high without being harsh.... Joyce cooling &#34;third wish&#34; for instance The triangle was in my left ear and just so sweet !!  the bass in my right, didnt over color the rest of the guitar riffs. Everette Harp  &#34;all for you&#34; - I could even hear the echo of the sax. The snare was clear and crisp and the bells stood out in the background. I do a bunch of studio work and could see each musician in a separate room- Its THAT GOOD !... Ok, last but not least- Rick Braun  &#34;Walk the Walk&#34; -  I actually teared up- sounded better than my 30,000 McIntosh reference system. !! The horns, clappers, bells, and all the percussion were balanced and stood out as the engineer intended. I never heard it sound this good. It actually was all new to me. These are so consuming, that all background noise is eliminated and you have to mute them- (button on wire included) to hear a person talk. The cord really will not tangle- no matter how much you turn around. I am very pleased and well worth the extra price over what is supplied with my devices. A bunch less than paying for names like Bose, B & W, shure etc.... I find these brands to be overpriced and color the sound.... of course - all my gear is on &#34;mid- position&#34; , because thats the way the track was laid..... I hate colored- boomy sound... and its fatiguing after a few hours, anyway. No fatique in these--- OMG , I am listening to them right now and Joyce cooling - &#34; The wizard&#34; has timbales in there that are awesome... boy do I love these- Why listen to speakers??? Just buy them !!", "Those that complain about these not being comfortable fall into two categories:1) Ears in which nothing will fit comfortably because of their unusual shape.2) People who don't take 20 minutes to try all the different combinations until they find the one that is best.Not really an audiophile, but I do appreciate a good sound. These have a deeper base than any other ear buds I've tried (granted I haven't tried all that many). I prefer over the ear head phones such as the Seinhiezer 100, but sometimes ear buds make more sense and I am happy with this selection.The flat cord is another nice touch. The cush selection is limited (four different types), but I was able to find a pair that work wonderfully. I'll be interested to see how durable these are as I am pretty ruff on earbuds, but they do seem well made.The push button for off and on, skip and start over is pretty limited. I prefer having a volume control, but if one stops and thinks about it when you want to deal with volume it is often just to turn it all the way down to hear the outside world for a moment. One push of the button and it pauses the track and you can hear the outside world.So far I'm very happy with the purchase.", "These have probably the best sound I've hear out of ear buds, but the fit hurts, I've tried many different combos of  cushions, but cant seem to find the right ones. Luckily I don't wear them often as they are my backup pair when my blue tooth ear buds die or am using the computer. I really wish I could find the proper fit.", "Tested with: Sandisk Sansa Clip, LG/Google Nexus 5I bought these earbuds to replace my JLab J4M (which I've always rather liked).  The J4s are already quite good, but, these completely obliterate them.  I'm not an audiophile, but my hearing is pretty good.  with thesePRO:-They stay in my ears so much better than any other earbuds.  I can run with them in!-Dynamic range is very nice, lows are low without compromising the midrange or highs.-Great isolation, so you don't need too much volume.-Totally reasonable price.-Microphone so you can make or receive calls without unplugging the earbuds from your phone.  Button too.-Flat cable doesn't tangle, seriously.-Slim TRRS connector works with phone cases.-Unique appearance, stands out from other earbuds.-Included case to hold them (or to hold other things I suppose).  JLab loves doing this and I support it.-Recyclable packaging!CON:-Aesthetics: you'll love it or hate it.--examples: cable is grey on one side and black on the other.  Can be helpful for removing twists, but, might look weird to some.--Silver paint is very loud and usually used on cheap electronics.  I'd rather it be black.These are the best earbuds I've ever used.  I'd take them over some that cost 2-3x as much.  Well done, JLab.", "Excellent earbuds in terms of clarity of the music and the different notes.  I am not an audiophile by any stretch but I have to admit that these are quite exceptional.  The clarity is something you get on the likes of a Bose type headset (I have owned them in the past).  I was honestly pleasantly surprised particularly given the pricing for these.One are where they need to work on is the comfort.  They can be rather uncomfortable and I tried the different buds not sure if it is the shape or what.  I found a combo that works.  I still gave it 5 stars because honestly if they fit the clarity is amazing.  If they don't fit they don't and return them.Highly recommended for clarity and sound.The blues ones are also cool looking."], "Gamma": [0.037136055529117584, 0.03730957210063934, 0.03731127828359604, 0.035888202488422394, 0.03731127828359604, 0.03731811046600342, 0.03718652203679085, 0.00829300470650196, 0.013104286976158619, 0.037310708314180374, 0.03731127828359604, 0.025593996047973633, 0.03580533713102341, 0.03731127828359604, 0.0372663289308548, 0.03696052357554436, 0.037308719009160995, 0.03731127828359604, 0.008278085850179195, 0.03731127828359604, 0.03728993609547615, 0.008214793168008327, 0.010017096064984798, 0.03731127828359604, 0.005145591218024492, 0.03731127828359604, 0.03721887990832329, 0.03149604797363281, 0.035433847457170486, 0.03731156140565872, 0.03731127828359604, 0.03731127828359604], "Beta": [[0.2891971170902252, 0.08106490224599838, 0.4526759088039398, 0.10888837277889252, 0.0008199618314392865, 0.06735377013683319], [0.28922417759895325, 0.08102455735206604, 0.4527270793914795, 0.10887607932090759, 0.0008192872628569603, 0.06732876598834991], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.2889842391014099, 0.08132608979940414, 0.45219603180885315, 0.10910936444997787, 0.000831034267321229, 0.06755335628986359], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.2892270088195801, 0.08102082461118698, 0.45272764563560486, 0.10887505114078522, 0.0008192136883735657, 0.0673302412033081], [0.2892428934574127, 0.08106915652751923, 0.4527028799057007, 0.10886721312999725, 0.0008198840077966452, 0.06729801744222641], [0.2965821623802185, 0.1007828637957573, 0.4417843222618103, 0.10454382002353668, 0.0010834074346348643, 0.05522333085536957], [0.27930858731269836, 0.09057596325874329, 0.4414154589176178, 0.11463723331689835, 0.0011389650171622634, 0.07292379438877106], [0.2892245054244995, 0.08102425187826157, 0.4527275264263153, 0.10887588560581207, 0.0008192778914235532, 0.06732858717441559], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.29149311780929565, 0.08375155180692673, 0.4466261863708496, 0.10953991115093231, 0.0008786660037003458, 0.06771060824394226], [0.28946495056152344, 0.08158319443464279, 0.45242685079574585, 0.10876026749610901, 0.0008266812656074762, 0.06693800538778305], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.2892322242259979, 0.08104051649570465, 0.45271870493888855, 0.10887231677770615, 0.0008194917463697493, 0.06731676310300827], [0.2892703711986542, 0.08114071190357208, 0.4526362121105194, 0.10887452214956284, 0.0008220170275308192, 0.0672561526298523], [0.28922441601753235, 0.08102475851774216, 0.4527270197868347, 0.10887600481510162, 0.0008192890672944486, 0.06732857972383499], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.2965889275074005, 0.10080573707818985, 0.44177111983299255, 0.1045389249920845, 0.00108372385147959, 0.055211540311574936], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.2892434895038605, 0.08102530241012573, 0.4527045488357544, 0.108885757625103, 0.0008197505376301706, 0.06732117384672165], [0.29661738872528076, 0.10090318322181702, 0.44171497225761414, 0.10451803356409073, 0.001085070543922484, 0.05516131967306137], [0.29585590958595276, 0.09837652742862701, 0.44316673278808594, 0.10506148636341095, 0.0010502887889742851, 0.056489042937755585], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102420717477798, 0.4527275562286377, 0.10887578874826431, 0.0008192748064175248, 0.06732843071222305], [0.27095407247543335, 0.09902571886777878, 0.43138015270233154, 0.11939823627471924, 0.0014943307032808661, 0.07774753123521805], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.28920072317123413, 0.08104671537876129, 0.45270028710365295, 0.10889017581939697, 0.0008199528092518449, 0.06734216958284378], [0.2902671992778778, 0.08333506435155869, 0.4515068829059601, 0.10835998505353928, 0.0008492192137055099, 0.06568162888288498], [0.28892576694488525, 0.08146945387125015, 0.4521598517894745, 0.10901135951280594, 0.0008267206721939147, 0.06760680675506592], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102413266897202, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758334517479, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902], [0.28922468423843384, 0.08102411776781082, 0.45272764563560486, 0.1088758185505867, 0.0008192738750949502, 0.06732850521802902]]}
