This watch is perfect, doesn't have all the junk stuff like the Gear. Who wants to take video, stills, answer phone, etc.? Wait a minute...I DO!!!!April Fools", "works fine, but I wanted &#34;phone from watch&#34; technology", "\"I purchased this watch because I was tired of waiting for another smart watch whose name will not be mentioned. Anyway: This watch is fine so far (I just received it tonight).Setup was a bit of a pain. *Before you set up the watch be sure to download these two applications: 'Smart Connect' and 'Smartwatch 2'.*If you're using NFC pairing then lay your watch flat on its face then slide the back of your phone against the back of the watch until you either hear or feel the watch vibrate. Keep the phone close to the watch and it will load up.Once the setup is complete you're free to go to the Smart Connect application and download applications that come with the phone. Whilst downloading one application, scroll down to see other recommended applications. I'm glad that this watch has been released for some time now because when it first came out, the applications I downloaded (like Spotify) weren't available.Pros:Lightweight.Is comfortable on my wrist.Easy to swipe from screen to screen.Brightness - My brightness is dimmed down quite a lot (less than 25%) and the screen is still clearly visible.Infinite possibilities with application creation.Price - Way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy Gear (almost half the cost).ConsSetup process - See above.Messages - The messages read individually as if on an old flip phone; the messages are not grouped together. Not that big of an issue, but still worth mentioning.Watch faces - Not many watch faces are offered, but I found one that I like nevertheless.\"\"Limited colors\"\" - I put this in quotes and under cons because while you can change out the wristband, I've read reviews stating that if you do it voids the warranty.If you were deciding between this item (Smartwatch 2) or the Samsung Galaxy Gear then choose this.Will continually update as the time moves on.------------------------------------------------Update 23/2/14: Charge appears to hold for three days. Uses include checking the weather, messages, receiving calls and the occasional Facebook message. However, there is a slight problem; whilst charging/after the watch is done charging, the battery bar that is displayed is never full. Even when I first received the watch and fully charged it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 24/2/14: Problem about the charge has been remedied. If you're using a Samsung/Galaxy device, then you can simply use your phone charger to charge your watch. This has worked for me and now has my watch at 100% battery. I won't charge it again until the battery runs out to truly confirm the battery life.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 26/2/14: Charge is holding quite fine after two days of use. Battery is ever so slightly starting to go down, which means it might make it past three days and all it truly needed was a full charge via the phone charger. I've run into a \"\"problem\"\" whilst trying to delete applications from the watch. I'll list the steps as best as possible-On your phone click on the application you wish to delete > Hit the home button > Hold the home button > Hold the application until the tiny menu pops up > Click 'App info' > Click 'Uninstall' > Click 'OK'.Go to your Smartwatch > Find the application you just deleted from your phone > Click on it > -Once that is done, the application should remove itself. It's easier than it appears to be; it's just a lot of steps which are quite easy, and are really small steps.The only problem is deleting pre-installed applications. This cannot be done, so be wary of what you install on your Smartwatch from the pre-installed application list when'st you first get it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/1/14Day SIX of NO CHARGE! This watch is amazing! Only problem currently is the lack of the weather application to be able to open. This could possibly (and hopefully) be due to not having a full charge or near a full charge. The battery looks to be at about 25% currently, and I do have a double today at work. The watch might just make it for seven full days with only one full charge (or even longer?). This is incredible. I'm not too sure if the watch will still work as just as a watch (being able to ONLY tell the time) when the battery dies. I suppose I'll find out.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/2/14Holy crap! DAY SEVEN!!! This morning, around 11 a.m. before I left for work, the watch vibrated and said '10%'. And guess what? It's still on and hasn't died yet and I have been using it excessively since last night and today. It's holding up just fine. I really want to reiterate: *IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BETWEEN THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2 or the GALAXY GEAR THEN GET THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2!* -It's still holding it's full charge for seven days (one week) now, even with moderate AND excessive use. This watch is truly better than the Galaxy Gear, and half the cost too! It does exactly what you'd want it to do. Notifies you of a notification, be it Facebook, text, Snapchat, Kik, etc. If you get the Galaxy Gear you have the option to reply back on the watch. Hello...the screen is so much smaller AND it's in T9 (which is where you have to type the number 1 three times if you want to get to the letter 'C'). Also, with all the reviews I read on that, I highly doubt the Galaxy Gear's charge can hold up to this.*This watch's rating is going from a 4 Star to a 5 Star. This has been truly impressive and has held up now since I got it back on the 18th of February. This will be my last edit to this review as there's not much else to say that I haven't already.---I know my review is long, but if you read the whole thing, you'll be glad you did. The review helps with daily entries of how the watch holds up!\"", "This is a great watch right out of the box. The watch has the look and fell of a standard wrist watch, with a metal bezel and band. As far as bands go, there are multiple options, any 24mm band can be used to personalize. The only sign of not being a regualar watch is the big plug where the micro USB charging port is located, which sould have be located under the watch for asthetic reasons. The battery lasted 3 days with multiple alerts and notifications, best to charge the watch while sleeping, which only takes 2-3 hours. The watch can be paired with NFC or bluetooth. Once paired, the watch has a limited number of apps, waiting for more to come. This watch is truly and extension of your smart phone. The watchs screen displays icons much similar to the ones on your phone. There are apps for answering the phone, twitter, facebook and so on. The only achilles heel of this watch is that the default email function ONLY works with Sony phones, which is a big slap in the face. In this day and age of technology, you would think that a watch that notifies you of GMail, twitter and facebook would be able to notify you of my hotmail or yahoo email. If the default email function and charging location were solved this watch would be 5 stars. The Smart Watch 2 is by no means a bad watch, just a watch that has to evolve.", "I was torn between this and Galaxy 2, but not anymore.  Not only is Sony much cheaper and suits me better, but as of April, 2014, you can now change the wallpaper, similar to Galaxy 2 watches.  Overall I think this smartwatch is better suitable for me than Galaxy 2 and here is why:Battery lasts longer:  Two plus days of moderate use and it still keeps on ticking.  Charging it everyday would make it feel like another device rather than a watch.  I wasn't a fan of wearing a watch, but I am now.Charging:  To charge this, simply connect it to any USB-powered outlet or computer.  Galaxy 2 offers a complicated dongle and because I'll have to charge it more often, it would become a hassle.Less is more:  I realize that with Galaxy 2 I can take pictures and use it as a speakerphone, but do I need that?  First off, taking a picture with your watch will make you look downright creepy at times and I'm sure with time, more public places will notice and restrict the use of it(like gym.)  While talking through a watch might be handy at some point, do I really need to look like a Power Ranger on a street?Thinner:  Sony is thinner by design and as I've mentioned before, it was important for me to have a swartwatch that resembles a more traditional discreet watch rather than a &#34;look at me I'm a futuristic device watch.&#34;Cheaper:  If you get the right deal, this watch can cost you almost two times less than Galaxy 2 and because I do not eat caviar for breakfast nor own a diamond-studded swimming pool, this is important to me as well.Please note that I am not putting Galaxy 2 down.  I'm a fan of both brands.  I own a Galaxy phone and a tablet, which is why I was so torn, but Sony2 suited my lifestyle better.  Both devices are great and it all depends what you need a smartwatch for that should be the deciding factor.", "My decision on purchasing a Smartwatch came after I decided that I was tired of replacing batteries or face crystals and/or wristbands each time a watch battery would die. It's funny that you don't realize how difficult it is to get inside some watches until you have to.I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note II, and was originally set on getting the latest Samsung Galaxy Gear. But after noticing the subtle differences between the Gear and the SW2...&#8226; SW2 weighs less&#8226; SW2 has an interchangeable wristband&#8226; SW2 is water resistant for (showering, washing hands, light/med exposure to fresh water)&#8226; SW2 is easy to read in direct sunlight (even in low-power mode)&#8226; SW2 synchronizes w/any Android BlueTooth and/or NFC device running Android 4.2 or greater&#8226; SW2 is under $150 (when purchased thru Amazon)&#8226; SW2 has a nice selection of Apps from the Play Market&#8226; SW2 running only the stock software v1.4.51 has improved my battery life to 7 days (normal use) w/out a recharge&#8226; SW2 uses any standard micro USB for recharging... so with that said, the decision was easy.", "I tried the Samsung Gear, the Pebble watch and this, the Sony Smart watch. As an avid watch-wearer (since a little kid), I give this watch a 2 out of 5 star rating.Pros: Touchscreen is nice, battery life is adequate, non-proprietary micro-usb connection, display is perfect size.Cons: For the price there should be a speaker/mic, wake-up button hard to press, couldn't get apps to sync old messages properly, a little to thick for watch wearing, and the biggest issue is the distracting Sony logo on the front.One thing I'd like to see on all of these devices is a locator app that would require some sort of micro pezo beeper in the watch in the event you lose it.", "I tried this with three different phones....Moto X, worked flawlessly, not problems whatsoeverHTC One M8, it didn't want to stay connected, it kept saying connected, disconnected, connected, disconnected every minute of so...Galaxy S4, worked flawlessly....I think this is an overlooked item in most peoples book. For the price, it's 1000% better than my Pebble ever can be, and it looks slick.Functionality wise, everything syncs and worked well with my phone, there were plenty of options as far as other apps go, and they all seem to work well. No complaints on that department.Its all a matter of personal decision. This does work well and does what it's suppose to do and looks good doing so...", "I tried out the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch but after a few days returned it and decided to try the Sony SmartWatch 2. This review is a bit of a comparison of the two watches. I hands down prefer the SmartWatch 2 over the Galaxy Gear for several reasons.1) The strength of this watch is that it isn't trying to be everything. Because of that, the price is now 1/2 of what the Galaxy Gear cost and that makes this watch a very good value.2) Don't sweat the lack of camera or speaker phone that the galaxy gear has. The camera was gimicky on the Galaxy Gear and unnecessary. The speakerphone while useful at times in the Galaxy gear, is not something I miss at all now that I've switched to the SmartWatch 2.3) I think the Sony SmartWatch 2 looks better than the Gear. It has a subtlely handsome look and an understated quality feel and appearance to it. You can wear this watch with almost anything and it would not clash or draw attention to.4) I got a few compliments from women and men about my watch the first day I wore it to work. No one has any clue it's a smartwatch at first and just think it looks cool. The Galaxy Gear I thought was more eye catching in a way I didn't like or want.5) The display on the SmartWatch 2 is always showing the time. I love it! The GG has the display off until you bring up your wrist up in front of you to look at the time, then it would delay for an awkward second, before the screen turns on and you can see the time. The SmartWatch 2 is easy to tell the time at any time.6) I work in a hospital and must do constant hand washing. The SmartWatch 2 is waterproof, while the Galaxy Gear is not. I was very afraid to splash water on the GG and it drove me nuts as I don't have time while working to have to worry about drying my watch all the time or trying to protect it from splashes.7) The screen on the SmartWatch looks just fine. It's not as sharp as the GG screen, but it doesn't matter. You can easily read many rows of tiny text on the screen when receiving longer messages. Yes you can see pixels up but so what. It's still perfectly decent display for the use case.8. The SmartWatch UI acts just like Android device. There are back, home and menu keys. There is a swipe down gesture that brings down notifications.9. The black rubber watch band is very comfortable in all day use. I couldn't say that about the Galaxy Gear at all. The Galaxy Gear irritated my wrist throughout a days. Part of the metal clasp of the Gear watch band would rub against my wrist and caused me irritation. Also you can replace the SmartWatch band with any watchband.10. My suggestion is to NOT load a lot of useless apps for use on the Watch. I only install the free &#34;WatchIt!&#34; notification app, along with the gmail and text apps. The WatchIt app will allow you to send any notification that appears on the top of your mobile phone to the watch as well. I started off by blacklisting all apps so they DON'T show notifications. Then I go through and approve only the ones I want. Be conservative in what apps you allow to buzz you on your watch. It will get annoying quickly if you allow dumb stuff to bother you and buzz your wrist all day.11. You'll want the stock text message app as it allows you to view and reply to text messages using preformatted replies. You can create your own pre-formatted replies. I deleted all of the stock pre-formatted replies and created my own. When you get a text alert on the watch, you press the menu button, and then the text message icon button to reply. Then you can swype left or right to cycle between your preset replies. It works pretty well and doesn't try and shove more functionality that just won't work on a smartphone.12. The watch does what it's supposed to do. I can view the time at all times, and it lets me get notifications to my wrist so I don't have to pull out my phone at work (which we have a strict no cell phone policy at work). I don't miss any important calls or text or emails anymore. I know when I have to step outside and deal with a call or text and when it can just wait.", "I used this watch for about 4 months now to give it a real world evaluation.-Pros- light and unobtrusive- battery lasts for a few days- customizable- easy to charge with a micro usb-Cons- People will keep asking why you didnt get a galaxy gear- not the best in direct sunlightI bought this item for a few simple reasons. I needed a way to see if I was missing a call or message while on motorcycle/ loud car such as a convertible. It works very well for that. Feel the vibration, look down and see the type of alert. If I have my phone in my pocket, i set it to silent, and then am able to reject calls if I am in a meeting without even taking my phone from my pocket.Sony has released two updates since I have owned this watch. First update allowed me to create my own watch face layouts as well as other tweaks. Second update within the last week now allows me to set my own image as the background.I started out getting all alerts sent to my watch, but I am now down to only Gmail, text messages, and phone calls. You can respond to texts, but only from pre-set responses and you can pre-create your own. Helpful for the motorcycle when i can just tap &#34;on my way&#34; or &#34;sorry, i am currently riding my motorcycle and will call you later&#34;.It does not have a built in camera, but does allow remote viewing of your phone camera. Resolution isnt too high, but it does allow for remotely taken group pics with you in them. I use it at work to see network port numbers in really hard to see areas.I compared it to my cousins galaxy gear watch, and his clearly wins, I could buy over two of these for what he paid vs what I paid. He was shocked that mine could just charge off of the same charger the phone uses, his needs a special device.  If you are looking for a do it all gadget to shove in peoples faces, get the galaxy gear, if you want a sensible watch that happens to have apps, alerts you to notifications, and still has people coming up to you asking &#34;Omg, is that one of those smart watches?!&#34; for half the price of the other one, get the Sony.", "I asked for this for Christmas, instead of the Galaxy Gear, because it's compatible with more phones. Although this watch has a poor screen and somewhat chunky look, I was still fairly pleased with it until today. I found out that there was a firmware update available and used the Sony Update Service to install the update. The update completely bricked the watch. No matter what I do, I cannot get it to turn on. I spent quite a bit of time on the phone with Sony support and they could not figure it out. It will be going back for a replacement. A quick internet search reveals that this is a common problem and apparently one that is directly related to the firmware update. If you have this watch, I would avoid updating the firmware until this issue has been addressed.", "This review attempts to discuss attributes of the Smartwatch 2 not shown on Youtube or Geek sites for prospective buyers considerations and research purposes.I guess the best feature of the Smartwatch 2 is its ability to Auto pair the device with your handset via the NFC tap. You must be running Android 4.2 or greater on your phone!You must download the Sony app called Smart Connect to download apps that are specific to the watch. The caveat here is that you need to have purchased and paired the two in order to see 'what it can do'. There is no clear way to evaluate the capabilities prior to purchase.This can also be said for the Samsung Gear device as well. I look at this the same as I would the 15 minute app evaluation offered by the Play Store except on a higher dollar level. Neither offer the consumer a comfortable evaluation level.One can only hope there will be better OEM firmware updates and better 'useful' third party apps on the horizon. Case in point and obviously one of the major detraction's to the Smartwatch 2 is the limited selection of clock faces!Granted there is a third party app called Custom Watch that adds 14 new watch face templates that are customizable but this app suffers in that it closes when the watch display goes into sleep, as it will revert back to the Sony clock face in embedded in firmware.I should point out that there is an option to do what the developer calls Use as Watch, which keeps the Custom Face focused at the risk of a faster battery depletion.Another minor annoyance is the leading Zero digit always displayed. Example: 8:12PM will read 08:12 even though the PM is displayed. You can also select 24 hour clock as a work around to this if you prefer a military time style display.Also I should mention that the charging port cover does not offer much purchase for the fingernail to open, it is a plastic not rubber type door. With that said the watch body and wake button are very well made. The black silicone strap so far seems impervious to collecting lint that some straps are prone to do.The alert vibrate is perfect on this watch quiet but noticable with a non adjustable 10 second display timeout. The OS is reasonably fast and fluid on it. The Sony branded GMail and SMS extensions (as they are called) will prove useful to most buyers and there are several extensions from Sony that others will find important like the included fitness app, twitter, remote camera, find phone, calendar, facebook, etc.There are many free game and game like apps on the Play Store that are interesting but not very productive for just killing 'Time' ;)Compared to Smartwatch 1 with the LiveWare bluetooth connectivity this watch is superior in its ability to discretely stay in the loop with email and sms. But not so much to customize it as amoled watch. But compared to Samsung's Gear with the whopping 1.9Mpix wart on the band this watch has more appeal to it and hopefully the Gear 2 will be absent of the camera feature for a sleeker wear.All in all it's a nice product and after fiddling with it for a few days i'll be keeping it, but as an honest review with this firmware revision it's just not ready for prime Time unless one insists on up to the second notifications of incoming communications.EDIT UPDATE:- As of yesterday 1/7/2014; there was an update to the Custom Watch app which lets you set AND KEEP ALIVE any of the Custom Watch faces even after the 10 second time out before the watch falls into sleep mode or what Sony calls Low Power. What this means to the wearer is that you do not have to re-select a custom face any time you pick up the watch or back out of a SMS/email read.It also looks like he did some power refinements as well. After installing the update yesterday and then a full charge now it's 24 hours later the battery reads 90% full charge. So now I upgrade it from meh to ehh.", "Its ok. Its a watch. Battery life is good. Comfortable to wear. Its just ok though.", "I bought this because I manage a warehouse and most of the time I leave my phone in the office to go in the back area (about 50 ft. away) and like that this gives me a head's up on whether an email is coming through or if it's a text message, FB, etc.  Battery life is decent too.I wish it would tell you when a phone call is coming through.  It will wait until the call is missed to let you know this (S5).  No big thing, just an improvement suggestion.My one big gripe is that the USB cover is embedded in the watch.  I have to use a knife...yes, a sharp pocket knife to pry open the door cover located on the left side of the watch.  I have tried a multitude of ways to open it but this is the only sure fire way I have found if I don't want to spend the rest of my day picking at it.NOTE: You have to buy the app programs for the watch from the Play Store (Android).  There are a few that are free but most will cost you depending on what you want to control or be notified about.", "I like this watch.  But there is one big problem nobody has mentioned (that I have seen).  While it doesn't look too big on my wrist..  its dimensions are such (just wide and thick enough) that it doesn't slip under my sleeve cuff, even with the looser button in use.  So it causes my shirt to be hiked up and it sticks out.  If I tuck it under, it is tight... and won't slip out with out my other hand helping.. to see the time!!  This is a deep six for this watch.  If it won't slip easily in and out from under my sleeve cuff, it is just a nuisance.  I hear the Galaxy Gear is bigger but slightly narrower.  I am guessing that this is the reason.  It is the width more than the thickness that is the problem.I am bummed because I like the watch otherwise!Update 10/28/2013I still like this but there are more annoying features1.  Options are unnecessarily limited.  In particular, it would be great to modify the vibrate with regard to number of vibrations and duration. Augmented Smartwatch pro lets you do this but it is expensive and not so easy.  I would love to modify how long an alert stays on the screen.. and modify font size so I could see them!  I would also like to modify the order of the apps on the phone.  You can change them but it isn't very flexible...and there are no directions for doing it.2.  Unless you get to your alert quickly (and you can't modify how long the alert stays on), you have to push the button on the side, Then the home button, THEN the app button. THREE PUSHES??  This makes absolutely no sense.  You should be able to hit one thing, be it the screen or the side button and the last alert should be on the screen.  Again, this could be an option.I am hoping so badly that third party people come up with things that fix these obvious deficiencies.  The apps are limited though.Update 11/4/13Incredibly, the bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch interferes with the bluetooth connection between the car and the phone.  When I receive a call in the car, the voice of the caller is garbled.  The phone is transmitting to the watch because the caller id is on the watch screen.  Turning off the watch doesn't help (because the phone is still transmitting to it).  This is a major issue for me.  I am hoping there will be a solution.  I am aware that some others are having this issue and some are not having this issue.", "Nicely built and responsive touch screen , worked as expected the only downside of this device is that it drains the phone battery.", "Don't expect a lot from this (or any) Smartwatch.It keeps excellent time.It connected seamlessly to my Android phone ( Nexus 5, new, latest version of Android ) by a simple NFC &#34;tap,&#34; then remains connected (for the most part successfully) via Bluetooth.It will vibrate and flash alerts.  You can set it so you can answer, even dial your phone.  But you can't send texts, emails, or talk into it.  For the most part, it's one way only.  ( I say for the most part, if you want to &#34;dismiss&#34; a phone call with a pre-set text message, you may be able to do that).Is it worth the price?  Yep.  That's because it reminds me when I walk away from my phone, and, boy, with all I have on that phone, I'm delighted the SW2 has an APP that vibrates when I move too far away, and locks the phone if I don't go right back.The rest I find sorta' functional.  But it is definitely getting better as Sony improves the Firmware and developers offer new Apps."], "Gamma": [0.03166428580880165, 0.03166428580880165, 0.03166428580880165, 0.03166380152106285,
