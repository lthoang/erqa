I love streaming music off my iPhone, but usually carry the phone from room to room or plug it into stereo speakers and just turn it up. With this, I can keep my phone plugged in while I stream and take the speaker everywhere. It's portable and not too heavy, and the sound is decent, too. It's not as good as my stereo multimedia speakers with subwoofer, but for something so small it's great.The battery life is decent, too. I usually need to charge it once or twice a week depending on how much I use it (I use it daily). All in all, this is a great device.", "Great sound for such a little device.  My husband and I have been looking for just such a device as this one so that we can share our mp3s with each other and listen to podcasts together. This little speaker fits the bill perfectly.  It was ready to go right out of the box and synced up with my phone very quickly.  This speaker is easy to move from place to place and holds a charge for a very long time.  It will tell you audibly how much charge is left and it is very easy to charge just by plugging it in for a short while.  The sound quality is very good and is great for music as well as audio.", "This is a solid little sound system. Out the box, it feels incredibly sturdy - the rubberized bottom and grips make it stay in place even at top volume, and it doesn't feel like a stiff wind would do it in. It synced effortlessly and beautifully with my bluetooth (when first turned on, it talked me through the process - I didn't even have to look at the manual), and it gets really good sound quality for a speaker the size it is. (Even bass.) In volume, it can't compete with a full size stereo (for, say, djing a party or playing alongside your drum set), but I have never encountered a minispeaker that could get this loud, and it's more than loud enough for casual play. It holds a great charge. For devices without bluetooth, the cable to connect it to the player is conveniently tucked in to the bottom.The one thing I'm not nuts about is the start-up sound. It does kind of draw attention to itself. It's not enough of an annoyance to dock for it, though.", "I thought the sound in this extremely small device was amazing. And like all Jabra products I have used so far it was extremely easy to sync with my iPhone. It charges with a USB cable that you can plug into your computer (I used a Macbook Pro but you can also probably connect right into a wall socket with a USB adapter) and the battery charges fast and lasts a long time (the specs say 9 hours). The only thing I didn't like was the intro sound when you sync, turn-on, and disconnect the device. It can't be turned up or down (it is a single bass synthesizer note). Not a big deal but the volume should be tied to the volume of the device.Overall a very cool addition to my iPhone listening experience.", "love the size!  small enough to take anywhere!  bluetooth syncs well... very easy to use!  Also takes auxiliary cable or headphone cable (3.5 mm) to plug in and use.  sound is decent... doesn't do well in very noisy places because volume doesn't go very loud, but sound itself is great.. lots of bass for such a small speaker.  i was very surprised by the sound quality!", "This is a great idea! It is a small portable speaker that works with laptops, I-pads, mp3's, and I-phones. I was also impressed with its durability. The speaker is not cheaply made and is easy to use. Enjoy!", "The Solemate is another winner from Jabra. They really seem to be an up and comer and I have been very impressed with their products. I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Note to stream music and it works very well. Pairing is easy and the sound is very good for something the size of a small banana.", "I had a Jawbone for several years, but after dropping it (a lot) the bluetooth finally gave out so I started shopping for a new one.  I was given this one to try out, and though I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth - I don't love this speaker.  The design is kind of clunky, although it does have an audio cable nested in the bottom which is pretty clever.  It's just not very stylish.  And unlike the Jawbone which allows you to download various voices to the speaker so you can customize the messages and alerts, the Jabra has a really boring voice and no way to change it.Ultimately, though, the most important aspect of a speaker is it's sound and the Jabra just doesn't compare.  It's super-bassy which is fine for some music, but not for everything and it sucks for television or movies.  I spent ten minutes on the very unhelpful Jabra site and found nothing about how to adjust the tone.  Overall, it seems like this speaker wasn't thoroughly envisioned before it was manufactured - perhaps the second version will be better realized.", "UPDATE: After hearing some other Bluetooth speakers, we've come to realize the SOLEMATE MINI probably has the best sound quality in the miniature speaker class, and better than some larger speakers. Also, after pairing with multiple sources, we noticed that the Bluetooth pairing process was truly brainless. So I'm updating my rating from four to five stars. That annoying voice isn't really that annoying, and he doesn't come on that often.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The most important issue with a speaker is sound quality. In the MINI bluetooth speaker class, this unit has Very Good sound. Five stars. If you need party volume, don't buy a mini speaker.Build quality/survivability is also Very Good. Five stars.But the darn thing is haunted. There's a voice that comes on with instructions. I don't like my gadgets talking to me unless I ask. I wanted to deduct a star for this, but the voice is only for special circumstances, so this review ALMOST stayed at five stars...Until we used it for a while and noticed that you cannot adjust the sound level until a music source is connected and playing. If you have a teenager, she will play the volume at maximum. When you next use it, the volume is still at maximum. It does not turn down by itself when you re-pair it to a new device, nor does it give you the ability turn down the volume without a source connected. You will be blasted unless you remember to turn down your source first. Turning down the volume when switching to an external input is a well known user interface practice, and even a safety issue. Minus one star.Summary: Very good product, recommended. Be prepared to be blasted if you have a teenager.", "This is a decent Bluetooth speaker for any compatible device. Setup was a piece of cake, it evens speaks you through it.The design is nice. The rubber footed bottom helps it from sliding on virtually any surface. I fact the grip made it feel suctioned almost to a glass table top. I like how there is an audio cable underneath also. It also has a button in between the volume button that when pressed will tell you the battery level.As nice and easy to use as it is, there are drawbacks.1. There is too much bass. The sound is loud and the base is very loud.2. There is a limit to how low it will go. I had the speaker as low as it would go and my iPhone as low as it would go and I found myself wanting to still make it lower. I couldn't. It still sounded loud and the next volume lower for the speaker was mute.3. The speaking feature is really loud and annoying. That and the sound effects when turning it on and pairing can go away. I like that it can tell me the battery level, but a little less obnoxious would be nice.I have a Bluetooth speaker by another company that is half the size, sounds just as good and is not as annoying. I'll be sticking with that one.", "Mini Bluetooth speakers have become very popular in recent years and Jabra (known for Bluetooth headsets) has thrown their hat into the ring with the Mini Solemate.  My current Bluetooth speaker is the terrific Logitech UE Mobile Boombox, so I was eager to compare it to that.Sound from this Jabra Solemate is great, and was able to fill up a medium sized room with ease.  It pairs easily with my iPhone 5, and had good reception (though not as far as the Logitech).  Though looks is a subjective thing, I prefer the conservative appearance and round edges of the Logitech over the Jabra.  The jagged edges at the bottom of the Solemate do make it stand out more, if you prefer that.There are a couple of issues I didn&#8217;t care for.  The main one is the annoying and loud start-up and shutdown sounds.  There doesn&#8217;t appear to be a way to lower the volume on that or shut that feature off.  Also, the lowest volume setting is still pretty loud.  I like to fall asleep to soft music at night, but unfortunately that isn&#8217;t an option with this speaker.Despite these issues, this is a high quality speaker system.  However, I&#8217;d probably stick with Logitech UE if I were deciding between the two.", "I am very happy with this speaker. The size is handy, a very small footprint. The sound however, is exceptional for a speaker this size. The footing of the speaker is ridged rubber so it stays where you put it and you can also store your 3.5mm double male jack (included) in the speaker footing. The operation is simple and the buttons few. There is an On/Off switch on the side next to the 3.5mm jack and the USB connector jack. The speaker came fully charged but you can charge it with your smart phone charger. I have a Samsung Note II that I connected with using Bluetooth and it connected and played flawlessly. I got the same results with an iTouch 2nd generation so the Bluetooth software looks to be very up to date. There are 3 buttons on top, volume up, volume down, and speakerphone. I tried the phone with my Samsung and that worked perfectly as well. Voice clarity was exceptional. If you want a small speaker that connects easily, sounds great, and is portable and easy to use, you should take a good long look at this Jabra.", "Amazing for such a small speaker! I am very fussy about sound quality of my electronic devices. I am the kind of guy who will decide to buy/not buy a car partly based upon the quality of the audio system it comes with. So when I say that this little speaker will easily fill a small to med room with full range, crystal clear, high quality sound, trust me, it will. The unit is also beautifully designed, manufactured, and packaged. It took all of about 30 sec to pair it with my iPhone 5. This is my second Jabra product, and I have nothing but great things to say.", "What a genius little device, especially for the price.  Pretty fantastic sound from such a small form factor.  Granted, it's directional, but that should be expected in this class of device.I became interested in this speaker after hearing the very good audio of Jabra's USB/bluetooth Speak 510+ speakerphone.  It's only about 4&#34; in diameter, but can do a more than adequate job with HD voice audio in small-medium conference rooms.  Jabra is doing magical things in this format.The dynamic range of the Solemate Mini and bass is quite acceptable for the size of device, but it's important that you set your expectations accordingly.  It's perfect for solo use on a back porch or with a small group of friends, but it won't replace your stereo system.  It's small, light and very portable, while providing very good fidelity.  The controls are fairly intuitive, but you will need to RTFA a little, especially for the speakerphone component.  The on-off switch is recessed a bit too much for easy operation, but a fingernail will handle the job.Good, solid construction and the rubberized casing provides very good durability and aesthetics.  The bluetooth paired up very easily with my phone, but I haven't tried the NFC component yet.  The included and color-keyed 3.5 mm cable stored in a built-in channel on the bottom is a brilliant touch (but I imagine that it's a PITA to replace if lost).  Plus, the blue is a perfect match for my cyan Nokia 920, so there's that, too.", "The overall sound quality on my unit was poor.  There was an underlying hiss that found its way into everything I played through the speaker, and from different devices.  It occurred at all volume levels.I have the larger Solemate, and that speaker is superb.  The sound from the Mini was much thinner than the larger speaker, certainly in part because of the missing front subwoofer.  But the drop in sound quality, including the hiss, was simply unacceptable for the price.  I simply can't recommend this unit.The overall build quality of the unit is solid, but that doesn't make up for the poor performance of the core function - audio quality.After using the unit, I also want to validate the comments of others concerning the volume controls on this unit.  you are not able to reduce the volume on the unit significantly using the volume buttons.  That is a bit frustrating, and I simply don't understand that design/functionality choice by Jabra.", "This is a really odd speaker review. My main issues aren't with the speaker sound / operation. Instead it's about the completely unnecessary EXTRA sounds that the manufacturers felt were necessary for this unit.When you turn the unit on, you get a loud sound stream to prove the unit is on. Great - but what if my aim was to quietly listen to some classical music or to play a lullaby to an infant? What if I'm at work? You get a similar loud noise when shutting off the unit.When you work with the bluetooth you get an incredibly annoying, arrogant guy telling you, &#34;Go ahead and CONNECT me - use the BlueTooth setting on your phone!&#34; And then when you connect he announces, &#34;Soulmate is connected!&#34;Please, please, I don't need this guy talking to me.The sound itself is reasonable. Not as good as my many other speaker sets we've used over the years, but for a small, portable unit to bring with me and my cellphone on the road, it'll do. It seems to focus on one part of the sound and bring that forward, muddling the rest. When there's a person singing, you often hear mostly them and not the instruments. When it's a classical piece with violins you might hear the violins and barely hear the other instruments. But that's OK. I don't expect superb sound out of a small unit like this.What I *do* expect is that I can turn it on, off, and connect it, without these annoying other sounds involved.", "I received this product through Amazon's Vine program.  That means that I got it for free in exchange for agreeing to write this review.This is a small, portable stereo speaker that can connect to audio devices like MP3 players and mobile phones either using the supplied stereo cable or Bluetooth.  It measures about 5 x 2 x 2 inches, and is small enough to take just about anywhere.  It appears to have two stereo speakers in the front and a single bass woofer in the back.I like somethings about this speaker and didn't like others.  Here is my Pros and Cons list:Pros:.  Portable Size.  Very small and easily portable..  Sound Okay.  Sound is acceptable given the size..  Nice Cord Storage.  The unit comes with a short stereo cord to allow you to connect to devices that do not support bluetooth, and the cord stores very nicely on the bottom of the unit..  No-Skid Bottom.  The bottom of the unit is coated with a very nice non-skid material and includes ridges.  It will pretty much stay wherever you put it without slipping.Cons:.  Non-removable battery.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine.  When the battery dies, you'll have to recharge it.  You cannot pop out one and pop in another rechargeable battery.  When it loses its ability to recharge, the device is useless.  Some smaller devices (bluetooth headsets) are so small that it may be impossible to use a removable cell.  Likewise for devices that are sealed against water for use at great depths.  But, *this* device doesn't need become junk in five years when the battery dies - but it will..  So-So Sound.  When you first turn on the device, it runs a demo mode that pumps out a a lot of bass.  However, when you actually use it to play music, it sounds much, much smaller.  Personally, I prefer a larger speaker with better sound..  Silly Blue LED:  Whenever you're connected via Bluetooth, a blue LED blinks on and off very frequently in an annoying pattern.  In low light settings, the light is even more annoying.  And there's no need for the light.  If you're listening to music via a Bluetooth device, you already know that bluetooth is working.  I can see having a light to show the status when you first connect, but that's not really necessary as the device could simply tell you that using the speakers.  And that brings me to my next point....  Voice Prompts WAY TOO LOUD.  When you first turn on the device and whenever you push the middle button, it gives you a series of voice prompts to tell you what's going on, i.e. pairing, connecting, connected, battery status, etc.  However, all of these prompts are way too loud.  Even worse, the volume buttons on the unit have NO AFFECT on the volume of the voice prompts.  Those volume buttons only affect the volume of music you're playing.", "When I received the Solemate MINI portable speaker package a few weeks back, I fully realized where this item got its name from. This speaker is tiny, very tiny, and I quickly began to wonder if this would do the trick for what I had in mind for it. I wanted a speaker that I could leave in my bathroom to listen to music via my iPhone to help assist in my shower singing capabilities and to keep me company as I prepared for my day. With the Solemate being so small, I began to worry that I wouldn't be able to hear it above the sound of the water running in my shower, but I have to say that my worries were immediately squashed upon first listen to this tiny yet powerful device. The sound quality is great and the volume is surprisingly impressive. The Solemate is extremely lightweight and has a very convenient AUX cord included in case you need to connect it to an older school non-bluetooth device like an iPod classic. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy to transport bluetooth portable speaker with great sound quality.", "I was given the chance to review this item.  I am familiar with Jabra from the Bluetooth headsets, but had no idea they built speakers as well and have never purchased a Jabra branded item before.1.  What's in the box?:  You receive this mini speaker in a nice black and yellow box that protects the speaker quite well.  You must be careful to pull the bottom bracket apart to reveal the instructions, a USB cable (for recharging the battery) and instructions.  You also receive (cleverly hidden on the bottom) a headphone cable to attach between mini jacks should you want that option.2.  Aesthetic:  This thing is smaller than expected.  It will fit - and is about the size of - an adult's palm with fingers outstretched.  The item I received is black with a rubber like material surrounding the item and rubber 'feet' on the bottom (similar to a running shoe actually).  On the top are three buttons (volume and use), and on one side is the brain center including a power port, power button and a headphone jack.  There are also small LED indicators for power and Bluetooth connections.3.  Use:?  First off, this IS genius.  When you turn on the power button, after a few moments, you get a recorded muscial message welcoming you to the Solemate and then instructions to connect to the Bluetooth source. When you configure your phone or other device it says connected (yes it tells you the status) and you are ready to go.  Typically, to test how intuitive the item is for users, I will avoid the instructions to see how easy something is to understand.  Here, from receiving the package to getting music from my phone literally took less than 5 minutes without a single issue.  Awesome.  This feature is a home-run grand slam in my opinion.I was able to play music for a while.  If you press the volume buttons on top it will give you corresponding beeps which is nice.  The middle button will allow you to see how much battery power exists and it also has a phone function (more on that momentarily).Sound?: Surprising.  I played a wide variety of music and was generally pleased with the quality of music.  This is not the highest quality of speakers that exist (not to be expected either), but the sound is fairly full and pretty rich sounding with good bass response and nice quality sound overall.  The volume itself is certainly not overwhelming, but adequate (you will not be causing the neighborhood to complain - unless you are staying in a monastery).  I do believe that the source of the music makes a difference as well.  If the music you choose on your device is not 'loud' then do not expect this box to ramp it up significantly either, it won't.I have used this item outside in a park, in my car and in the house.  Outside this item is pretty decent. You can hear the music clearly and it provides nice background music for activities.  Perhaps the best application so for is in my car.  Instead of using a headphone cable, I simply placed this item on my dashboard (it goes no where during driving thanks to the 'sneaker feet' described above) and used an app for music I liked and voila I had great music in my car (you could use Pandora or whatever) with really good sound actually.  I was surprised how much fuller the sound was in the car versus outside.In the house, this was useful for purposes of testing, but of course probably not the best application.  Sound was adequate, but not overwhelming (even when turned to the maximum).  However, I LOVED the Bluetooth for use as a supplemental speaker for my laptop and music collection to stream because this definitely sounds better than the computer speakers ( I have purchased a Bluetooth dongle previously).  Again, I would not have thought of this use, but this item can grow on you after you use it.  And given the small size, you could easily take this on a plane trip as well.Be aware that you can use the Bluetooth to use this as a speaker.  Similar to headphones, you simply press the center button to answer the phone and you can clearly speak and listen to the conversation.  The quality is apparently pretty good for listeners. Again, a very useful function that may not be immediately obvious (Iphones and Android typically will cut the music out and switch to the phone function seamlessly and back again).Battery power:  this item apparently uses a Lithium Ion battery which is similar to a laptop battery.  I have charged this item to full charge (the blue LED will go off once fully charged) and have not gotten to the end of the charge yet (I will update this in the future with my experiences).  However, initially charging took only about 1.5 hours and the instructions specify about a 3 hour charge (using a micro USB port).Overall:  Yes, I was offered this for a review.  And I do understand that this is an expensive item relatively speaking; I have been wanting to purchase a speaker like this for a few months because I wanted to solve this application.  However, after using this for a few days (so far), I have become incredibly impressed with the clever design and usefulness.  There are quite a few things I can do now easily because I have this box.  Expensive, yes.  But I have become appreciative of the initial quality and ease of use.  The Bluetooth receptivity has been very solid in days of use.  Further, I love the aesthetic design because this can be placed in your pocket, but will also tolerate being placed on the dashboard without going anywhere.  Being able to use phone apps for music and getting good quality sound is pretty awesome for road-trips as well, and nicely executed.Conclusions:  Although initially curious about the item, I am a solid believer in this item, and it has becomes one of those things that I would appreciate as a gift by a thoughtful person.  Solid effort and probably worth the cost given all the great applications.Overall:  Extremely useful item", "Just in time for the Holidays This is the perfect gift for music lovers. I was quite surprised to hear the amazing sound the Jabra projected through such a small box. I played various genre's of music through my iPod to test the sounds and I have to say that the Jabra played beautiful no matter the type of music, voice or instruments. I keep this in my office and place it discreetly on my desk. It is not an item that is in your sticks out as it blends well in any decor. It was so simple to use which is a big plus for me (I hate reading long pages of instructions) This is truly a plug and play item. Plug in your devices and hit play How easy is that? Now sit back and enjoy. This is a keeper", "This is a small, I mean palm of one's hand small, device which will play in high fidelity signals from many devices. It's main purpose is for Bluetooth or NFC devices but the unit has stored in its base, a patch cord allowing it to be used in a wired manner to pretty much any and all devices out there. Tethering your unit, NFC or Bluetooth to the device, if convenient, will result in longer battery life for both the Solemate and your device.Pairing the Solemate Mini to your device is a matter of seconds. The instructions are a bit vague, though. Here's how to do it. You put the powered on Solemate Mini into reception mode by pressing a button for that purpose. It's a large button on top of the unit. Then go into the Settings (iDevice and many others) Bluetooth menu selection and have it discover devices. The Jabra will soon appear. Select it and the Solemate Mini will voice a confirmation. From then on until you break the pairing, that Bluetooth device will synch up to the Solemate Mini.The sound is surprisingly good especially with music in the middle to higher ranges. The bass doesn't boom you out of the room but that'd be a silly expectation given the physical size and nature of this device. The only area of less than good sound seems to be in some lower register voice such as a male radio announcer. Even then, the sound is decent if not up to the quality of other ranges.The device has sound outlets on both sides. I found the best and fullest sound came when I pointed the ends of the device toward me rather than the speakers. Strange but true.Overall the sound quality is that of a better quality table radio. I don't mean something like a Bose Wave but rather a typical nightstand or kitchen duty radio. This is darned good given the diminutive size of the unit.It takes three hours to charge from flat. In my battery rundown test with the unit on Bluetooth link and at a volume of a typical radio (make it about 75 dB) it ran seven hours and then required only one hour to recharge to full. Obviously this device can boom along for a whole day  and much more on a single charge.You charge it using your USB charger from your phone or a typical USB port on a PC or Mac. The device comes with a USB to mini USB patch cable for this purpose.In sum, this device has greatly increased the usability of my iPhone and iPad. Before this, I had to either use ear buds for good sound or tolerate the built in speakers for squeaky low fidelity sound. This one is a keeper. Highly recommended.", "\"Important Updates, below:Being a young 60 year old, I've got to say that aside from the microwave, the BEST invention in my lifetime has been Bluetooth technology! Begone all you cables that get crimped, lost or misplaced! And in that same vein, the Bluetooth speakers just become smaller and sturdier and generally just better.This is my 16th Bluetooth speaker. I've bought several on my own and received several to review via the Vine program. Up until now, my hands down favourite has beenHMDX Jam Plus Portable Speaker (Yellow), even beating out my mega expensiveBose SoundLink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II - Nylon. I adore the Jam Plus for the light-weight, jolly colour, ease of operation and kick-arse sound it delivers at the job site. The Bose, although very, very nice, is too heavy and too expensive to use in constant outdoor situations and in particular, outdoor WORK situations.However, there is absolutely NOTHING to protect the finish of the Jam Plus so after a month of being picked up with dirty garden gloves (and dropped a couple of times), the poor thing is looking rather shabby. I was very excited to read about how the Jabra SOLEMATE Bluetooth speaker was specifically designed for outdoor conditions and ready to put it to the test.It comes nicely boxed for gift giving. Instructions, Warnings and the USB cable are hidden UNDER the cardboard cradle that the unit sits inside of. Instructions are sparce; if you're a first time user of Bluetooth, you might need to \"\"Ask the kids\"\" to help you out with working through pairing.Like most Bluetooth speakers, you charge it first, but mine came fully charged. YEAH!!! You then turn on your music source on your tablet/smartphone first, then go into SETTINGS and open Bluetooth, Make It Discoverable, and Scan Devices. At that time, turn on the tiny switch at the side of the speaker and hold down the centre button for FOUR seconds.  I must admit, I was completely unprepared for the \"\"background sounds\"\" that this device comes with: when you turn it on, a space ship sound comes on, and then a deep Barry White-like voice COMMANDS you that it's \"\"Ready to be paired to your device\"\". When the pairing actually happens, \"\"Barry\"\" announces that it's paired. I guess this would be great for blind people; I find it amusing, for now. Not sure how soon \"\"annoying\"\" will soon follow.The size of the unit is like a Hostess Cupcake package (remember them?). Very nice weight: not too heavy and not too light. The bottom is super gripey: a corrugated rubber bottom really adds security for grabbing and also providing stability if you're really rockin' the tunes. An extremely handy line-in cable is coiled beneath the unit; I still have an ancient and beloved Zune MP3 player so being able to use this speaker for my extensive collection is invaluable! Easy to grab with gloves, the sound is large and rich and doesn't become drowned out, even when sirens or the nearby El is rattling by.Now that I have this speaker to add to my daily life, I can quit obsessing overBose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker. A far more expensive and delicate creature, I tested this product at a Bose store and this Jabra speaker is close enough in sound yet superior in sturdiness, that I'm quite satisfied. :D-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated Dec. 17, 2013:I thought about dropping my rating on this speaker by one or two stars but after a long debate with myself, I'm still keeping it at 5 stars, because of the sound quality and ease of use.However, and this is a BIG however...this speaker does NOT enjoy being \"\"disturbed\"\" while streaming music! What I mean by this is: If you are streaming music from your smart phone or tablet and have the audacity to want to 1)check email, 2) check the weather, 3) use any single app, the music streaming will be disrupted every time you touch your device!!!! I do NOT know if this is a flaw on my speaker only or if anyone else is having this problem. But, I've now relegated this speaker to MUSIC STREAMING ONLY, meaning that I'm not using my device to read recipes, time the meals, check emails, etc.I do not game, but I'm guessing you might need to touch the screen during play. If so, ANY touching of the three screens I have this speaker paired to all react the same: the speaker's streaming is *burped* or interrupted with each touch.So, if this is problematic to ALL Soulmate Mini's, you might want to consider buying a Simple Audio \"\"Go\"\" speaker for $100.00. I now use that speaker whenever I am actively using my device and there is ZERO interruption of streaming when you touch your tablet or e-reader!\"", "\"Bluetooth speaker technology is becoming more and more popular as people rely on smartphones to listen to music. The Jabra Solemate has been one of the more popular large Bluetooth speakers. Jabra has now released the Solemate Mini to appeal to people who want a super small, portable speaker with good sound.The first thing you notice about the Mini is its size. True to its name, the Solemate Mini is a tiny speaker, easily fitting into the palm of my hand. The Mini looks just like its big brother. It is ruggedly built, with a tread on the bottom that holds it firmly in place, and a tough rubber skin.The Mini has three buttons on the top, up and down for volume control and a button in the center that gives pairing instruction and lets you know how much battery power you have left. The center button also allows you to answer incoming telephone calls. The On/Off switch is on the side. The switch is small; I have to use the nail of my finger to turn the speaker on or off. If your phone is NFC capable you can connect that way by tapping the phone on the side of the speaker. Jabra also includes a 3.5 mm audio cable that smartly is built into the bottom of the speaker. A nice feature, as it is very easy to lose these cables.Be warned that when you turn the Mini on, it produces a very loud chime telling you the speaker is on, and provides pairing instruction. The \"\"on\"\" chime and instructions are extremely loud, and the volume control does not lower it. I made the mistake of turning the speaker on late at night, and nearly jumped out of my skin.The Solemate Mini pumps out a lot of sound, especially given its small size. I have a number of Bluetooth speakers, and primarily use the UE Boom and TDK A33, both larger speakers that produce a fuller, more detailed sound. The Mini is a much smaller speaker but gets very loud. I would describe the sound as very balanced and clear, with just a touch more bass. I listened to different types of music, including jazz, disco, rock and classical. Even at high volume, it is very easy to distinguish the different instruments. The speaker does distort at a very high volume, but event at mid volume the speaker produces more than enough sound to fill a room.Pairing is very easy. I used the speaker with my Android phone as well as iPod Touch, and paired both in seconds. As is the case with other Bluetooth speakers, the speaker gets louder with my Android devices, but the sound from the iPod is fine. I also noticed that the speaker does not get as loud when using a direct connection with the 3.5 mm audio cable and a non-Bluetooth device. The battery should provide 8 hours of playing time. I used it for more than four hours at one sitting and the battery status was still \"\"Full,\"\" so I am not sure of the accuracy of the reading.Overall, this is a great little Bluetooth speaker. The speaker is solidly-built, and produces booming sound. Because it is so small, the Solemate Mini is perfect to take to work, on vacation or on a business trip. The only negative is the very loud chime and pairing instructions. But good news. I just checked the Jabra Web site and there is a way to turn off the loud sound prompts when first turning on the speaker. Here are the instructions from the site.1. Turn off the Jabra Solemate Mini.2. Press and hold the \"\"minus\"\" volume button while turning the Jabra Solemate Mini on. Release the Volume button when you hear `Sound prompts off', indicating that voice guidance has been turned off.There are a number of Bluetooth speakers available today, but if you are looking for a decently priced compact speaker that produces outstanding, and loud, sound, I would highly recommend the Jabra Solemate Mini.\"", "One mighty little guy..........Now I am just a regular consumer .. Not an audiophile but I am LIKING this little guy a lot...I have several blu tooth speakers ranging from the  Bose to a Braven to some no name units... and I have to say this little guy  has some MUSCLE... it is the perfect size.( fits my sm hand easily). easy enough to pack along and big enough to handle the 2 speakers  it carries.... Now what puts this  Jabra speaker  apart from the others  is the attention to details in its design.It has a NICE SOLID FEEL.. not like some of the plastic speaker I have had  to try out. This Jabra feels like a unit that will works well if you sort of bump it around a bit.1. it has  a strong, thick, non skid rubberized base that will keep this little fella firmed seated where ever you put it ..  I tried it out in the car and it did not budge from my dash board through  out the ride2. In-bedded in the base is  the cable to  do a direct connect with your phone or tablet or computer  and no blu tooth is needed so you won't misplace this cable it can be returned to hits hidden track on the bottom of the unit.3.the 3 button's( volume control and paring button) on the top are large enough to easily feel them and use them but they sealed so no crumbs or sand etc will enter the button mechanism4.when you turn the unit on it has a SOUND ( some music ) that lets  you....know it is NOW ON5. when you pair this speaker with a blu tooth  it TALKS to you to let you know it is ready to go  and once paired and connected it again SPEAKS to tell you it is ready to gonow if your device is NFC enabled this unit only need a TOUCH and you are connected.6. the sound.... now this is what your most interested in............it has a nice range of sounds .. spoken words are clear( I listened to a audio book with it ) and then a range of .... music from the classics's, Broadway tunes, hard rock and soft jazz  and all of it was nicely blended w the appropriate amt of bass.7.  once charged up...  you have a good 8 hr of play time.. NICE>>>>>>8.  you can use the Jabra as a speaker phone  paired w you cell phoneI can see this unit being a faithful companion for me .. . I am really impressed with the tone of this unit .. It compares favorable with my Bose speaker... The Bose still has a better  separation of sounds but if I did not have the Bose to compare .. this Jabra would have completely Blown me out of the water ..I can say, without hesitation, this is one GOOD SPEAKER............ I am very pleased and plan on getting another one for a holiday gift...", "I opened the box and was pleasantly surprised at how small this unit is. I have to call it the pocket rocket because with the small size comes huge sound!I've had the Jawbone Jambox Small, smaller portable Bose speaker, a TDK TREK outdoor, and this unit.Of the less expensive ones, this one has the best bass. And it's small. But there are three caveats that really annoyed me: During testing there is a somewhat boastful voice saying &#34;c'mon, try me out, connect with me, turn on your Bluetooth on your phone, big guy.&#34; or some kind of less than business professional commands that took me off guard for a moment. After I did get connected, the other issue I had is that I was not able to precisely control very low volume. I could put my phone on the lowest setting above &#34;off&#34; and this one on the lowest setting above off, yet it was still too loud.One more complaint: You can't adjust the volume unless bluetooth is engaged and playing. My first use of this was in the office, so naturally I turn it on and try to press the volume down button. It wouldn't react to me until the music already started blasting...Wow that sounds like a lot of negative stuff, but it shouldn't! It's a great size, nice rubber base, good bass, just a few oddities like that and if they wouldn't bother you, I wouldn't hesitate to give this one a try", "This is a really solid competitor in the already saturated market of bluetooth speakers under $100. They have taken a leaf out of Jambox's book in terms of form factor and ease of setting up the device. The device has big sound for how small it is and performs really well until about 50-60% of max volume. My only problem with this set is that the sound degrades for low frequencies and start jarring a bit. When I compared it with the Jambox mini, the sound appeared to be a lot deeper overall (especially for lower frequencies). I have the give Jambox mini the edge in the head to head but a really good attempt by Jabra. Maybe the next one will be better at higher volume.", "It really feels like everyone and their sister is making a bluetooth speaker these days.  Where does the Solemate mini fit in?Price-wise, the Jabra solemate is in direct competition with Phillips Shoqbox, JBL Flip, and UE Mini Boom.  Size-wise, it also competes with more expensive alternatives UE Boom, Bose Soundlink Mini, JBL Charge, and Jawbone Jambox.  The Jabra Solemate is a very capable entry in the $100 price range.  It is very similar in sound quality to the Phillips Shoqbox, JBL Flip and UE Mini Boom.  I would venture to say this maybe the loudest of the four while while 2nd in sound quality to only the JBL Flip.  Compared to its more expensive cousins, the UE Boom, Bose Soundlink Mini, JBL Charge and Jawbone Jambox, sound quality is left wanting.  In comparison to the $150-200 devices, the Jabra Solemate is not as loud nor does it sound as good.  There is a reason why these companies charge more.Jabra like most new devices does support NFC.  Just bump a phone to the NFC logo on the side and you will sync up.  Bluetooth connectivity is simple and reliable.Design of the Solemate Mini is rugged.  Aside from the speaker grill, the speaker is covered in rubber.  The base has a cut-out to place a short 3.5 mm cable for connecting devices that don't have bluetooth support.  The cable fits snugly in the cut-out and adds a portable and convenient alternative.  The rubber serves a very practical purpose.  When at max volume, the speaker has enough traction and weight to not slowly move around the surface.Overall, this is a really adequate entry in the cutthroat market of bluetooth speakers.  If you are hard pressed to pay anymore than $100 for a bluetooth speaker, this speaker is a great choice.  Volume is best in its category, and sound quality is in the upper echelon.  But if you can afford $200, I would recommend the UE Boom, especially when you have two linked up in stereo.", "This is a nice blue tooth speaker.  It is compact and has a rich sound to it.  Fits very nicely into my hand and is easy to grab and go.  I typically use the speaker when I am sitting outside and want sound with me.  I was initially disappointed with the sound until I realized that I had the front pointing away from me (when you get the speaker, you'll see it is easy to do, front and back look the same).  When I turned the speaker around, voila!... rich, clear sound.Overall, I am very pleased with the sound of the speaker.  It is my new go-to speaker.  Pairing to my phone is a piece of cake and the connection remains strong over hours of use.  The speaker has a truly nice feature, which is to include the connector cable for non-Bluetooth devices in the base.  Brilliant... without this, the cable would go in a box of other misc. cables which I never find when I need them.With the positives, there a few negatives.  The most prominent one is that the speaker volume controls (on phone and the device) do not allow you to turn the speaker very low.  This really comes into play when it is quiet out and I want some low background music.  It is incredibly frustrating not to be able to turn the sound lower.  (the speaker goes from not-real quiet to silent.  nothing in between).Another silly thing is that the speaker speaks to you when it is turned on and connect.  Quite loudly.  Seriously, who thinks this is a good idea?  Or at a minimum, allow me to configure it (aka, turn off the voice).Pros:- The most important thing - very, very nice sound for the size of the the speaker- Embedded connector cable in the base of the speakerCons:- Very poor control of volume at the low levels (the lowest volume possible is too loud)- Annoying speaking voice when turn this speaker on (I really don't need my speaker talking to me)", "I've used similar products from several different companies and in a few different sizes.  This sounds great.  In a small room it sounds just as good as the larger models from Jabra and the competition.  It is really easy to use and its small size and fast connectivity makes it very convenient.  I have no complaints.", "This is fantastic speaker in nearly every respect. The sound is strong and clear, the design is more compact than the similarly-priced Jawbone, I love the clever cord storage on the bottom of the speaker and the fact that it's dust- and splash-resistant. My only gripe is that every time I turn it on, I've got to listen to a series of loud sounds that cannot be turned off or adjusted. It makes the speaker unpleasant to turn on and off in quieter environments. This is a pretty minor issue, I suppose, but given the fact that I have the option of turning these sounds off with my Jawbone speaker, it's the one I tend to use the most. I did a bit of experimenting and did reach a setting that loudly announced that I'd turned off &#34;notifications,&#34; but the sounds continued. This is really odd issue that seems to be the norm with a lot of these smaller speakers -- why do the designers and programmers think we need to hear these loud, annoying sounds every single time we turn on the speakers? It's the only thing that makes me recommend the Jawbone Jambox over these.", "\"When I first saw the size of this unit, I was skeptical that such a little speaker could offer a high quality sound. It is the color and size of a chalkboard eraser, yet it broadcasts music clear and loud, misleading others to think it's coming from a much bigger unit. Though it's advertised as being tailored for Bluetooth, I'm glad it's versatile - it comes with a USB cable and a speaker cable that allows you to connect it to non-Bluetooth devices - anything that has an outlet for a headphone will allow you to use this speaker, which is great.It's easy to set up, a fact emphasized by its small, 5-step instruction booklet. There are only three buttons on the top - two buttons  control the volume and when you press the middle button, you hear a booming male computer voice telling you how much battery life you have left (to be honest, this is gimmicky and annoying). On the side of the unit are the on/off buttons, the headphone outlet (for non-Bluetooth devices), and a USB cable outlet (for charging the unit).Everything about this unit is minimalist, and compact. The cable is neatly stored in an \"\"S\"\" configuration groove beneath it. The speaker is encased in rubber, which helps protect it from shocks. The bottom, in particular, is particularly thick and has grooved indentations that resemble the sole of a sneaker. This feature allows it to stay in place wherever you put it. Since it's also \"\"splash-resistant\"\", it would be make a great little speaker to have at the beach!My only quibble is that I wish it offered manual bass and treble controls on the unit itself. I'd rather have that than the annoying computer voice as mentioned above. However, I'm sure you can adjust the quality of the sound using Bluetooth.This is definitely a cute and portable speaker that I'll be happy to use on my travels.\"", "I didn't expect very much from this small speaker, but I was blown away! It's got huge sound and you can actually feel deep sound. This speaker is much better than my other bigger ones. Now I can use my big computer screen and this speaker to watch online movies instead of watching them on TV screen.It's very easy to set up. I can put the speaker in my lady-size handbag and carry it to anywhere.If I can give more than 5 stars, I would!"], "Gamma": [0.08902415633201599, 0.05531938746571541, 0.08810589462518692,
