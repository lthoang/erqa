"], "reviews": ["this is it nice for the summer time when your skin gets a little more dried out and works great on a sunburn", "I love this Triple action vitamin C serum. It smells great and feels amazing on my skin. never have I loved a Vitamin C serum more. nice large package and easy pump.  Can't say enough good things about this serum. I will be continuing to use this. Thank you so much for a superior product.", "I just received my triple action serum. It goes on smoothly, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  Makeup applies over it nicely.  Another reviewer said it was gritty, but that is not my experience at all.  I feel like it I like that it has a slight tingle which leaves me feeling like it's working and I have not had any irritation or redness. To my senses, it is basically unscented, which works for me. Get the free ebook for more directions. Needs to be applied day and night, not too much or it will dry the skin. Use a moisturizer. I give it 4 stars until I update...I am optimistic that this product will help with my dark spots, and lines...good customer service and fast shipping.", "I received a bottle of this serum for review purposes.  I have been using it for a few days now and have already noticed my fine lines starting to fade.  It has also helped me with my dry skin.", "I have tried other VoilaVe products before and I absolutely love them so I thought I would try their Vitamin C Serum. Yet another great product from VoilaVe! I've started to use this serum and my skin is beautiful! I'm really seeing a difference- my skin is soft, smooth and firm. And I particularly love it because it's repairing some of my skin damage from being a sun worshipper for so many years. I can't imagine how great it's going to look after using these products over a longer period of time! I'm also ecstatic that all of VoilaVe's products have been gentle on my sensitive skin while still being effective at making me look and feel younger. I'm glad I ordered this Triple Action Vitamin C Serum to add to my anti-aging aresenal. Thanks for the awesome products!", "VoilaVe For Me or should I say my wife! I ordered this serum for my wife in hopes of combatting the Dry Arizona weather and of course the effects of the blazing sun. At this point I can say that her skin is looking refreshed and not so tight and dry as it was. She loves the ease of application and was really pleased with the follow up that we have gotten. All of this and great shipping experience too!", "Five stars for this serum......I have been using this for a week and I have noticed it works.  I am a person who is serious about my skin care regimen and I love when I find products that actually works ,this product worked perfectly.  My skin is so smooth and clearer because some of the blemishes that I do have are fading.  This is my honest review and its from a week usage, and I think I will keep this apart of my daily and nightly regimen.  I would recommend this to others because the product does what it says, try it and you wont regret it, your skin will be glowing.", "If you are concerned about anti aging. Then I want to share Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid are so important to erase signs of aging and this product contains all this with and easy to use bottle. It goes on the face smoothly and nicely under your make up. I definitely recommend and the ingredients are top notch.", "I have used serums in the past but this is the first one I have tried with Vitamin C. Let me tell you, I notice a huge difference! My skin looks like it did when I was a teenager and I am loving it! If you have yet to try one with Vitamin C I would highly recommend Triple Action Vitamin C Serum. It is extremely high quality and will have me coming back for more many years to come.", "I like the consistency of this product. Very light/Watery lotion consistency to this serum .There are no silicones and (as far as I can tell) no coconut derivatives. It goes on smoothly and dries down quickly to a matte finish. It does seem to control oil a little bit. I find it to be more moisturizing probably due to the oils and hyaluronic acid. I use moisturizer over it also.It comes in a nice blue glass bottle with a pump. The pump doesn't squirt out a whole lot at once - I use about 1-3 pumps at a time. There's definitely no overshoot wastage with this serum. It's a one-ounce bottle, and I think it'll last me a couple of months. Fortunately, it's a MAP serum, so it should stay stable for that long.So far it doesn't seem to clog me at all and it's not breaking me out. I'm using it  twice a day in the morning and night, no dryness at this point.I like this serum. I would definitely recommend it.", "One of my favorite features of this product is that it carries 3 forms of vitamin C in it. Before making this purchase I was not aware that there were multiple forms of vitamin C and now I feel like this is a wealth of information alone because it will help me to make wiser buying decisions on skin care products. With that being said some benefits I enjoy with this product are the skin hydration that it provides and also the soft and smoothness it leaves on the skin after application. Very satisfied with this purchase!", "The wife looked at this product so I got it for her to try out to see if it really made any difference.  She has a few wrinkles she would rather not have as noticeable on her face. She followed the directions that are clearly stated and she has received good results thus far.  Now it didn't clear up all the wrinkles like some miracle potion but we do see a clear difference. We recommend this particular product and brand because of the results achieved.  We recommend the VoilaVe brand of this product.  As it worked for her.", "This product really works great. I have been using it for about a week now for my hands. I have developed a few age spots on my hands and this product has begin to greatly reduce the sight of them. Great product. will tell all my friends about.", "I purchased this with another of the products from this company. I am so very impressed with how well they work. I love the feel of my skin, no issues what so ever!", "Awesome product.  I tried for a few weeks and it worked wonders on my face.  My skin feels healthier and more radiant.  My skin does not have a ton of wrinkles but it did help the fine lines I have.  I am so excited and love this product! Fan for life here.", "This Vitamin C Serum is very effective and pleasant to use.  A little goes a long way. This performs as well as other serums I have tried and the price is unbelievable for the quality that you are getting.", "I have used several different brands of Vitamin C serum over the years, some of them worked well, others were too chemical laden, stung my face or would not spread easily over my skin -- so I would end up using way too much product and that in turn would cause my face and neck to dry out... this Triple Action Serum is wonderful - very light, barely there - but clean scent.  Easy to apply - you can cover your face with one pump! Absorbs instantly and leaves your pores looking smaller from the first use.  Since I do have dry skin, I follow immediately with a moisturizer.  I love that this serum comes in a pump instead of a messy dropper, no fillers, no animal testing and a 365 day money back guarantee - Excellent product from a trustworthy company!", "I highly Recommend this Vitamin C Serum. The Serum is silky and goes on smoothly. It is scent free and absorbs easily. I have used many different Vitamin C Serums and I find this one to be very effective and easy to use. The company offers great communication and customer service if you have any questions regarding the use of the serum. Great Product. Wonderful Customer Service. I highly recommend this Serum.", "The best defense is a good offense right? Well with loads of free radicals out there trying to harm your skin I have found this product to be very good in fighting it.", "I already use their Argan oil .......applying it religiously on my super dry heels ...NO MORE !!!!!!!!!...now my wife decided to get their vit C serumby the way  she brought everything from expensive french lines like chantecaille, spa line like dermalogica, natural lines like eminence, yonka, and jurlique, to organic lines like ilike  -  but this is the best bang for your buck!!!!!!!and it works better or just as good at fraction of the cost.For the  combination skin- oily cheeks/forehead/nose and dry in patches.Since using this serum we  have noticed a definitely change to the skin. it is hydrated, barely breaking out , and more even skin tone.This  product is worth trying !also it is Paraben free !!!!!!bottle is pretty big ...it will last  a while...... serum is very light non greasy ...", "I've been using this serum for about a week and already I can tell a difference in the clarity of my skin.My acne scars are lightening and my overall complexion is brighter, my co-worker asked me if I starting using different makeup cause my skin was glowing.Dark spots on my face are leaving and skin is so much firmer.I was amazed at the good results I realized using this product!I love the effect of vitamin C serum into the skin of my skin.If I have any irritation there's nothing to alleviate it quickly.I applied it before I proceed with sunscreen and makeup without any problems.I recommend it.", "Makes my face very smooth and creates a silky base for powder foundation. Some face moisturizers are too oily to wear under powder foundation but this isn't. I'm hoping to see some clearer skin soon!", "So, I've tried several different Vitamin C Serums but this is my first time using a Voila Ve product. I like the labeling and bottle. I actually thought the bottle looked pretty big, but after reading the label, I realized that it is the same size- 1 oz, as most of my other serum bottles. It's just shaped differently. I wondered how well the light would be blocked out so that it wouldn't affect the life span of my Vitamin C Serum, but upon closer inspection, the labeling and inner bottle do seem opaque enough so that light cannot get through.The pump top works well so that only a little bit comes out at a time.The most noticeable difference between this product and any of the other Vitamin C Serums that I have tried is that I don't need to use nearly as much on my skin. One big drop and I can use it all all over my face. At first when I started using it, I would use a few drops as with my other serums and my whole face would start to tingle. It didn't hurt, just felt weird. So, I looked up what was going on and learned that this sometimes happens when you use more Vitamin C than your body needs. This product must have a higher concentration of Vitamin C in it than my other bottles. It does say that it has 3 forms on the bottle. They weren't joking.Also, using too much can cause your skin to dry out a bit and I definitely don't want dry skin on my face!The clear liquid is easily absorbed into my skin and has been improving my skin texture.Yes, the results are visible. My complexion is a lot brighter and it feels tighter.I can use it under my makeup or before I head to bed, (always on a clean face though).So glad that there is no alcohol nor parabens in it. I'm always hoping the products that I am trying out have neither of those things, especially if I plan on using it on a regular basis.Afterward, I like to use Voila Ve's Hyaluronic Acid Serum.As a product tester, I was sent a free bottle in exchange for an honest review. I received no other compensation. All of the opinions shared here are 100% my own.", "Haven't used it for long. So far so good.  Like that it has Hyalauronic acid. Same ingredient that is in dermal fillers.", "My wife started using this product as soon as she received it and the benefits appeared almost overnight - her skin is smoother, wrinkles seem minimized and there is an overall brightness to her skin.  Serum goes velvety smooth and absorbs quickly.  definitely looking forward to seeing more advanced results with continued use...great product...recommend highly!", "I love this serum, it is really a &#34;genie in a bottle&#34;. It is the first Vitamin C serum that I have used that has the pump system opposed to a syringe, which I really like. It really has brightened my skin tone and left my skin hydrated and feeling healthy. It's a quality product and only takes a little so will last a while. It really leaves the face looking younger and refreshed.", "Using this on my face for a few days now and it feels really nice. I'm hoping that I will notice a difference in a week or so. Been looking for a product like this for a long time."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03620541840791702, 0.03679993003606796, 0.03627891093492508, 0.03567207232117653, 0.03479374945163727, 0.03699823096394539, 0.03920578584074974, 0.0374353788793087, 0.03720493242144585, 0.03295275196433067, 0.035060685127973557, 0.035457901656627655, 0.037292324006557465, 0.03887135535478592, 0.03918670862913132, 0.037720777094364166, 0.03589744493365288, 0.040833182632923126, 0.03766968846321106, 0.020867209881544113, 0.033946383744478226, 0.03767721354961395, 0.048297472298145294, 0.03729084134101868, 0.03960220143198967, 0.043235693126916885, 0.037545815110206604]]}
