"], "reviews": ["My dear sweet mother has been my model for this Regrowth Treatment.  It appears as if she has a slight patch at the temple that periodically thins out.  This has been applied for about 30 days, and there is not a sign of regrowth as of yet.  It may take a little more time, we understand that.You have three tubes each for 30 days.  One of the things that may be understood in the healthcare business is that you lose hair during the seasons.  There are times when she notices more hair thinning, regrowth, then thinning again.The product supply is similar to Rogaine.  You get three tubes of liquid and a small dropper to apply it.  It is advised to apply it twice a day, and she has been doing that, probably missing a few times.You can rub this into the scalp, or merely drop it to the scalp.  Keep in mind that much of the liquid lands on remaining hair, rather than in the scalp.In comparison to Rogaine, this is not as strong of a smell.  That is the one difference.  And, I firmly believe that the results of Pantene are not as effective as Rogaine.  Will update laterThere have been no side effects noticed.  Her scalp is clear, nothing to indicate disruption.  Rizzo", "I think this just may be the product I have been looking for.  They say on the package that it will take a few months to see the final outcome.  I have just started using it this week.  The comment I have though is that it is easy to apply and rub into your scalp.  Leaves no residue or odor either.  Now we'll see if my scalp has a little less shine in a few weeks.....(smiling)", "First, this is hard to review because I didn't start using this product right away.  Second, Amazon wants a review turned in 30 days from the shipment date...which makes it hard to completly use a product to its fullest to report on it.  That being said, I can tell you what I have learned.I was concerned that the product would leave my scalp greasy as I used this.  That did not happen, I never have felt that it was greasy or that a product was &#34;on&#34; my scalp (all good news!).  The product comes with a &#34;dropper&#34; type wand and it works easy to put the product directly on your head.  The product feels like it is dripping, but it doesn't really, a little bit goes a long way!  The box comes with plenty of product to complete a cycle (more good news!).  The bad news is I haven't used the product long enough for results.  I also didn't like the idea that &#34;if&#34; you quit using the product the &#34;new&#34; hair you grow will slowly fall out.  I had my own idea that this boosted growth and allowed for folicles to produce new growth that lasted.  So, if you at some point put all this money into new growth (lets say your a female and use it for 1 year to gain 6 or so inches of hair...it could be gone if you quit).  This was &#34;not&#34; such great news in my eyes, but maybe all hair re-growth products work this way!I will try and update this when I know more...", "I can't say that I am impressed with this 2% minoxidil product. Designed for women, it contains a 90 day supply which consists of three bottles and an eye dropper for application. It was difficult to open the bottles. Supposedly they are child proof but they are fairly adult proof as well. One of mine is cross threaded and I am still unable to open it. The product itself has a medicinal smell, like rubbing alcohol with some formaldehyde. Luckily it dissipates and is not noticeable after application. Application itself is messy. The solution is watery and runny and care must be taken to insure it stays on the scalp. I apply it with disposable gloves that can be purchased inexpensively at the dollar store or drug store. It makes my hair look oily so even though it doesn't interact with styling products, my hair looks dirty after use. Dosage is twice a day.To date, I have noticed no increase or improvement in my hair. Granted, it can take up to four months before results become obvious. However, that begs the question of why there are not four bottles contained in the kits. I found application messy. This product would be better in a different form, perhaps a foam or cream. I did not experience any side effects. However, I  was not impressed and after finishing this box, I will return to more natural remedies likeBrahmi Oil - Ayurvedic Hair Growth massage oil", "I have been using this product as instructed for between three and four weeks. So far, no new hair, but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer. On the plus side, I've experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes, dyes and topical medications. It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply.", "I ordered this without fully researching it. I have an irregular heartbeat and since this can affect your heart, chose not to use it. I do like that it can help women with thinning hair although wish a product could be invented without so many side effects for this problem.", "\"The box of this Pantene Minoxidil treatment proclaims in prominent type \"\"Hair Regrowth Treatment\"\" and \"\"CLINICALLY PROVEN TO HELP REGROW HAIR.\"\"  But the important part is in much smaller type on the back of the box: 81% of women will see little or no improvement.  Just 19% will see \"\"moderate\"\" improvement.  And NO ONE will mostly or completely grow back her hair from using this product.But even a LITTLE more hair would be a good thing, right?  Even if it's a long shot?  So I ordered a kit.I first tried a minoxidil product years ago but quickly stopped using it because it made my hair feel sticky and look greasy.  I like Pantene products, so I hoped that their version of minoxidil would be better.  It's not.  It's EXACTLY the same as every other minoxidil product I've ever tried.  To make it dry more quickly after application, the base is mostly alcohol.  This is a bit concerning because a high concentration of alcohol couldn't be good for your hair or scalp, right?  I don't want to dry up what hair I have left.  The second major ingredient is propylene glycol, which is probably what makes your hair sticky and greasy.  But still, I put it on my scalp, best as I could.  It's a very thin liquid, so every drop wanted to run straight off my scalp.  You'll need to spread it around with your other hand as you apply it.There are a lot of specifics you need to keep in mind about how to use this product:*You can't wash your hair after using it to avoid the problem of sticky/greasy hair.  You have to leave this product on for at least four hours.*The product should be applied to a dry scalp, so you can't apply it right out of the shower.*You should apply the product 2-4 hours before bedtime to give the product the chance to thoroughly dry and/or absorb so as to minimize the chances of your accidentally spreading it onto your face while sleeping and causing hair to grow there (seriously, this is in the instructions!).But did it work for me?  Alas, I'll probably never know; I just couldn't get past the icky way it made my hair feel.  I'd rather have thinning hair that's spectacularly soft and silky than to have slightly thicker hair that's matted down and always looks bad.  Your mileage may vary (my hair is somewhat fine; women with coarser hair might not have this issue).  If you're willing to take a chance that you're one of the few this works for (I can't blame you...I keep trying the stuff, myself), I'd recommend a different brand.  There are cheaper brands, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the 5% solution is more likely to work, and a foaming version would be easier to apply.\"", "My first comment isn't about the product-- it's about female hair loss.  If you're experiencing this, see a dermatologist immediately.  While some hair loss or thinning is normal, particularly after menopause, many times hair loss is a symptom of a medical issue--thyroid, auto-immune conditions, vitamin deficiency, etc.  Your doctor can run some simple blood tests to rule out these conditions.  There are also medications for hair loss, depending on the source of your issue.  So before you just purchase this product, do check with a doctor.As this product will take four months before results can be seen, I can only comment on my use so far.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros:  The solution is clear, easy to apply with a little practice, doesn't leave my hair sticky or greasy, has no odor, and dries quickly.  The instructions are helpful and the three-month supply means less trips to the store.Cons: It does take practice to apply and you need to be careful that it doesn't get in your eyes.  You have to apply it every morning and night forever-- the instructions warn you that if you stop using the product any hair gain may be lost.  This means a serious monetary and time commitment.  There are also some side effects (like with any product) so you should consider these considering you will be using the product perhaps for the rest of your life.Finally an observation: the ingredients in this product are no different from generic products which cost less. So if you do plan to use it on a regular basis you might want to compare prices and products.", "Let me clarify about the two star rating:  it's not that I don't like it but there were so many prohibitions on the carton that I didn't want to give it a try.  For instance &#34;Do not use if you have no family history of hair loss.&#34;  Then &#34;Do not use if hair loss is different than that shown on the side of this carton....&#34;Now, add those to the fact that only 19% of the women in clinical studies reported moderate hair regrowth after using the product for 8 months.  Well, this is a 3 month supply so I'd have to buy 2 more at around $79 a pop, and wait 8 months to see whether or not I'd be in the fortunate 19%.  Don't think so.  It is also noted that continued use is needed to keep any hair regrowth that appears.  In other words, a lifetime commitment - ah well, if Pantene giveth it also taketh away.", "This product is not easy to apply. It runs everywhere.  I just finished up another brand that was a spray and it was much easier to control, but after reading other reviews of things, I am going to try the foam.  i think that the product will be the same, just application will be much easier.  Also think I will order the 5 percent solution instead of this concentration.  Wouldn't buy this again.", "There is one spot on my scalp that has lost some hair due to stress. It hasn't really bothered me much but since this was an option from vine i figured why not. So far i have seen no improvement on the area after 1 month. It says it can take up to 3-4 months before i see any results, which is kind of counterproductive since vine only gives us 1 month to write a review for a product...why offer a product that we can't give the recommended amount of time to use? i have gone to my doctor for the hair loss and i was able to get a prescription through my insurance for the copay which was much cheaper than what this would have costed. My advice, go see a doctor.", "Pantene has entered into the hair regrowth treatment area with it's own minoxidil 2% treatment.  The minoxidil 2% content is the same as other hair regrowth treatments.  This will work as long as you hair loss is the same as the examples. You must continue the treatment to keep the new hair.  The only thing to compare is the price.  Pantene is slightly cheaper than the original name brand treatment and higher than the generic treatment.  There should be not difference in the results no matter which brand you choose.", "Before getting to my review, I&#8217;d like to point out that it&#8217;s a flaw in the Vine program that reviews are required within 30 days for a product that may take up to 90 days to see results. That being said, I&#8217;ve been using this Pantene minoxidil topical solution for over a month now and I&#8217;ve experienced no new growth so far. I&#8217;m not sure this is a fair amount of assessment time or not, but I would at least expect some baby fuzz by this point. I will continue to use and if my (non) results change, I will come back and alter my rating.As for the application, there are some pros and cons. On the plus side, the eyedropper screws directly onto the bottle and stays there until empty. Just screw off the bottle top &#8230; screw on the eyedropper. No fuss, no muss. On the downside, it&#8217;s really hard to get this product exactly where you want it on the head. Too much liquid is released at once. I find myself contorting my head back and forth trying to get the minoxidil to stay put rather than dripping down the nape of my neck and forehead. Kind of frustrating when it does that since I then have to wash it off (because, really, who wants hair growing on their forehead).The Pantene minoxidil topical solution has not worked for me so far, but perhaps it&#8217;s because of my type of hair loss. The product packaging indicates it is for widening of the center part and my thin spot is more in the back of my head. Therefore, your results may differ, especially if you give it the full 90 days.", "I don't like writing negative reviews and I am sure Pantene Minoxidil Solution works for many women, but it did not work for me. I tried for two days, but my scalp area which has the hair loss had some sort of an allergic reaction. My skin itched and turned red. I stopped using the product and threw it out per Amazon guidelines.", "I enjoy using Pantene product so I was interested in trying this new product for my thinning hairline.  This product is easy to use and does seem to help promote hair growth.  My hair does look fuller.", "Unfortunately, I cannot give an informed review on this product as after reading the directions and safety warning on the box, I decided to consult with my patient. I am a heart and stroke patient and the warning about chest pains concerned me. The box does say that it will not help EVERYONE. So, I decided it wasn't worth a repeat heart attack, for something that was not guaranteed.I have thinning hair due to medical conditions and medications and had thought about using Rogaine products. When I saw this from Pantene, I wanted to try it. I was shocked to find out that something like apply topical solution to my scalp has so many dangers.The package warns not to use if:-Your degree of hair loss is different than that shown on the side of this carton, because it may  not work for you-You have no family history of hair loss (that one I don't understand)-Your hair loss is sudden and/or patchy-Your hair loss is associated with childbirth-You do not know the reason for your hair loss-You are under 18 (obvious)-Your scalp is red, inflamed, infected, irritated or painful-You use other medications on the scalpIt also states that it may be harmful to women pregnant or nursingI really wished that I could have put this product to test. I cannot, and will not, deter anyone from using this product, but I will say, if you have a heart or similar condition, please consult your physician first.", "I have short THIN hair. I thought after 60days I would see a Difference .I did not see anything that made my hair thicker or grew my hair. Smells bad and does not work on my hair. It says it will not work on all hair but worth a try if it works on your  hair.", "I've only had this product for just about 30 days yet the recommended use for results is 90 days.... like many others I do not have that long to wait and do a review. I can only speak what it is doing for me up until this point and so far I have seen no improvements in the area on my hair that are thin, mainly the nape area.You do not have to use a lot of this, the box comes with 3 bottles of regrowth solution and you must apply 1ml twice a day using the dropper that's included. It is a clear liquid and in my opinion very messy, it drips down my neck and I just find it a bit frustrating at times, maybe if it came in a cream  or spray then applying it would be easier. It does leave your hands a tad bit sticky if touched so be sure to wash your hands immediately after.I'm going to give this about another month, since I know growth aids like this require ample time to work, and maybe then my opinion of this will have changed and I will give an updated review.", "A typical Minoxidil 2% hair growth remedy. It is cheaper than some competitors, so I would say if you are into Minoxidil, it works for you, the price is good.", "I've used the Pantene 2% Minoxidil treatment per directions for a couple of weeks now, and there are absolutely no visible results. If you're hoping for a fast fix, a permanent fix, or a definite fix, this is not it. According to the package information, results become apparent after 4 months -- but Pantene only gives us 3 month's worth of product. Marketing of this sort strikes me as dishonest and we shouldn't tolerate it.  And the product itself is a little questionable.According to all the research I can locate, Minoxidil 2% solution is not very effective. Small clinical trials have shown that the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair in women with androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss. A quick scan of WebMD gives you this information: Results from clinical studies of mostly white women ages 18 to 45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss report that after using minoxidil for eight months, 19% of users had moderate regrowth and 40% had minimal regrowth. Of those using a liquid without active minoxidil (a placebo) during the same time period, 7% reported moderate hair regrowth while 33% had minimal regrowth.Not very encouraging. And don't forget that minoxidil is not a permanent cure. If (and that's a big if) it works for you, you have to keep using it. Twice a day, every day.  Quit and the hair falls out again.The FDA has approved the much more effective 5% solution for over-the-counter sales to men; women need a doctor's prescription.  Don't ask me why. As we get older, most of us experience a little thinning on top. Mine isn't a problem and when it is, I'll deal with it. It's smart not to wait too long, by the way. If you have androgenetic alopecia, those empty hair follicles die and you can't bring them back. Nothing will work. So don't wait too long.Some women may want to explore hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if their hair loss is related to perimenopause or  menopause.  Estrogen and progesterone pills may provide some help.  You can also investigate follicle transplants.  You'll have to shell out $4,000 to $15,000 for a transplant, one session takes from 4 to 8 hours. I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...but it's out of your pocket and not covered by health insurance.Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can't give this product more than two stars. I suspect it deserves just one. Pantene is cheating us from the gitgo by providing insufficient product to determine efficacy, we must make a second investment just to find out we are  among the tiny percentage for whom it works, and on top of that, they're charging us considerably more than other manufacturers.  If you want to take a chance with 2% minoxidil, go price shopping. Don't pay for the Pantene label. And don't expect much.", "This product takes some time (up to 4 months) to see visible results. I have been using it for 32 days without fail. The active ingredient is the same as the other marketed and widely available minoxidil topical solutions.  It is dispensed in the same dropper and bottle as the generic version I have used years ago. It is considerably less costly than the brand name &#34;Rogaine&#34; with the same active and inactive ingredients. I have found the Pantene version to have a more pleasant smell. And I do like that it is marketed for women as opposed to the others being generally for the male population.I have had success with Minoxidil in the past and plan to continue the use of this Pantene version. It is nice to see Pantene has made the leap into addressing a problem that affects many women of all ages.", "First things first, the instructions in the box say that it will at least be 4 months before you see true results. It is sold in a 3 month supply pack. Tricky, eh? Yes.It is priced slightly higher than other brands and yet it does the exact same job if not less. So is the price hike simply because it's made by Pantene? Probably.It's going to take a while for me to say how this goes. I can you that it is easy to use but as far as results, well the Pantene experts say it will be 4 months before I see &#34;true results&#34; lol.", "\"My own experience in a nutshell: easy to use. I put a thin nitrile glove on my nondominant hand and manipulated the dropper in my other hand. By massaging the liquid into my scalp, I kept the liquid from dripping and made sure it ended up on my scalp where it may do some good. I have been using twice a day as instructed, but instructions say it is likely to be 4 months before I see results. So, why isn't it packaged in a 4 month supply? This is a 3 month supply, so I am extremely unlikely to see significant regrowth by the time these 3 bottles are empty and will have to make the decision whether to purchase more without adequate information.In spite of this minor criticism, I am glad that Pantene has moved into the minoxidil arena. Women's hair loss gets too little attention from the pharmaceutical industry, so maybe Pantene can move things ahead for us. Having said that, I don't see anything about this Pantene minoxidil that distinguishes it from less expensive versions of 2% minoxidil.The delivery system is the old standard, a 1 ml dropper in a 60 ml bottle, giving a 30 day supply of product in each of the 3 bottles. The foam versions available from Rogaine and generics are a more convenient and easier to use form of the product, so I don't know why Pantene didn't go with foam. Maybe that is in the pipeline. I hope so, although I found that the liquid in the dropper was easy to apply so long as I worked slowly and massaged as I went.  It does not dry quickly. In addition to the minoxidil, there are 3 inactive ingredients: alcohol, propylene glycol, purified water. These are the exact same inactive ingredients as used in most of the minoxidil on the market.The warnings and advisements are also exactly the same as generic minoxidil and branded Rogaine. (I was happy to find that my scalp did not itch!) You have to use the product about 240 times to see results and probably for the rest of your life to keep the regrowth going. Hair regrowth is far from guaranteed. Clinical studies of 18-45 year old women with mild to moderate hair loss resulted in 19% experiencing moderate hair growth after using minoxidil for 8 months (19% moderate regrowth; 40% minimal regrowth). However, 7% of women USING ONLY PLACEBO experienced moderate hair regrowth (7% moderate regrowth, 33% minimal regrowth). And speaking of placebo effect, I am reluctant to admit that my hair already looks better today. That isn't regrowth of course. I'm gullible but not that far gone! It's the effect of putting the liquid on my thin, limp hair and massaging. That minor action has lifted my hair at the roots enough to give it a fuller look already.I have not been able to figure out why anyone would spend a penny more for a branded product rather than a cheaper, generic minoxidil. I see no differences whatsoever.But I do want to make one other point. Physicians who prescribe 5% minoxidil for their female patients have seen much better regrowth (from the American Hair Loss Association, \"\"Some small clinical trials have been conducted on 5% minoxidil for androgenetic alopecia in women showing that indeed the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair than the 2 % solution.\"\") But the 5% concentration for women is not yet approved by the FDA and may present dangers for us that need to be supervised by a doctor. With Pantene in the arena, my hope is that we may get approval of the 5% for women. That would be really good news. So, good luck Pantene!\"", "I have been using the Pantene regrowth hair treatment treatment for about a month now.  The box says I have to apply twice a day for three months before I will see any results. So far I don't really notice any difference on my scalp yet, but I have been apying it to my eye word and I do notice a huge regrowth there. I will update in a few months when I reach the 3 month mark and update the progress on how it is going.", "I did not see any new growth at all.  However I did see more hair in my sink after using it for almost a month. I used it since the day it arrived. It says you should use for 90 days but because we have to write a review in a certain time frame it may do better using it the longer period of time but I won't hold my breath!  I will discontinue use due to the fact  hair fell out after using it. I would not waste your money on it.", "I have never used a product like this before, but my hair is thinning due to aging, and since it was free, I thought I'd try it.  After I got it and read about all the side effects, I decided not to use it.  I don't want to take a chance that it could cause a heart attack as I am well past middle age and have had some symptoms already.  Also, the unwanted hair growth, unexplained weight gain, hands and feet swelling suggest that it is an allergen or a hormone or interferes with hormones.  I am taking hormones now to balance my body, and I don't want to take anything that will interfere with the good results I have gotten.If I were younger and had hair loss, I might be willing to take a chance, but at my age it's not worth it.  There are other good alternatives in the form of wigs, hair extensions and hair pieces that I can use to mask thinning hair without using something that might be a health risk.  They don't cure, but they do a heck of a good job of masking the problem so that an older woman can feel as self-confident about her looks as she did when she was young."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.033625200390815735, 0.040763236582279205, 0.035098105669021606, 0.04015621170401573, 0.040610428899526596, 0.03655427321791649, 0.03803078457713127, 0.0431629903614521, 0.039302706718444824, 0.03931356593966484, 0.038845766335725784, 0.03860532119870186, 0.03763938322663307, 0.03991211578249931, 0.03779244422912598, 0.03939519077539444, 0.04109162092208862, 0.040692366659641266, 0.038450803607702255, 0.037532590329647064, 0.04152680188417435, 0.03971240296959877, 0.023824641481041908, 0.039305392652750015, 0.039554838091135025, 0.039500828832387924]]}
