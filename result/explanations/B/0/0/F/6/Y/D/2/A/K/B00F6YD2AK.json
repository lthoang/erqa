And, after three days of playing Dark Souls 2, the verdict is in: DS2 is, in fact HARDER than the original Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. And it appears to be more fun too. But, again, harder doesn't not mean 'impossible' or 'unplayable'. It only means that planning, preparation and some practice involving a lot of dying is going to be part of your gaming experience. I will add some notes at the bottom of this review for anyone thinking to try DS2 but afraid of its impossible difficulty and for anyone who started to play the game and then abandoned it in frustration.GAME SO FARTo say that I'm impressed it would be an understatement. This third Souls title was not dumbed down or simplified in any significant way it seems. My first few hours were as good an experience as my first few hours of the first Dark Souls. Play is challenging and interesting in ways that got us to love Demon's Souls and Dark Souls in the first place. It's so... Dark Souls to experience the relief and joy of finally mastering the moves and tactics to beat your first significant enemy only...  to see yourself confronted by THREE of them around the next corner. In a few words, I love it.Getting a little into details and still under first impressions, the game plays in many ways like its predecessors. Most controls will get your toon to do what you'd expect it but there are changes, some subtle, some more obvious. So, here's what I've noticed so far:- Improved graphics: it's the first thing I noticed. Everything looks sharper, the color palette is a lot richer and... a couple NPCs actually move their lips while talking but that's only on cut scenes- No frame rate issues yet but let's see how this holds true throughout the rest of the game- New menus: everything appears to be better organized. But it's different from what we were used to so it will take a while- New items, some quite interesting. One of the starting gifts would allow you to raise the difficulty level of a specific bone fire area with the corresponding increase in rewards.- Non-boss enemies stop respawning after a while so you can't farm the same ones forever- Fast travel from the beginning: can teleport to any bonfire once it's discovered or this was the case with the couple I've got to so far.- More lore revealed explicitly but not a lot more at the very start of the game.- Loose central hub concept: not quite the Demon's Souls Nexus but,so far, there's only one place to level up so it's a hub- Hybrid healing: there is one Estus in the beginning but there are other healing items that heal in different ways. I expect to find some healing miracles as well at some point.- Classes: wanderer, hunter, pyromancer and thief are gone. DS2 classes are warrior, knight, swordsman (dual wielding), bandit, cleric, sorcerer, explorer, and deprived- Attributes: resistance is gone and won't be missed. Current attribute are adaptability, vigor, endurance, vitality, attunement, strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith- Max health: decreases as you keep dying and is fully restored as you regain humanity. One of the gifts is a ring that will increase your max health points when worn, not unlike the Demon's Souls Cling ring- Humanity: you no longer need to be at a fire to regain your humanity, not unlike old Demon's Souls.I can't say much about invasions, covenants and co-op play yet because I didn't go through these yet but I will update my review once I do. I suppose everyone is busy with early progress in the game so there's not much time for messing up with other people's games yet but I'm sure this is going to change soon, probably within hours. I also have no comments on the bonus pack because I decided that I will not take advantage of it because I am after the full game experience, as hard as it may turn out to be.IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DARK SOULSFirst of all, don't worry about it. You do NOT need any Dark Souls experience in order to play Dark Souls 2 so... enjoy. However, if you get a hold of the old Dark Souls, give it a try because it's worth it. Try Demon's Souls too. It's a PS3 exclusive and can be had almost literally for pennies these days.Also, do not believe anyone who claims that the Souls games are impossibly hard. They are not. I mean, they are difficult but not 'impossibly' so. Yes, they are different and to me they are unlike any other games but what that means is that patience, persistence and the willingness to learn from past mistakes will take you through the game because the game will make you get better every day while, true, quickly punishing you for your mistake or for getting too self-confident.The Souls games are some of the most innovative releases in a long, long time. I don't remember being so wow'ed ever since playing Ultima II as a kid, back in the 80's (yes, I'm THAT old). My first time playing Demon's Souls after a long gaming hiatus triggered one 'aha' moment that hasn't left me as I completed it, then played it again then moved to Dark Souls when it was released and it's still there as I just started DS2 and I was still playing the old Dark Souls last night. There's so much to say about the Souls games but let me just mention some of the more innovative aspects:- You are never alone, unless you play offline. You can see shadows or outlines of random other players as they progress through their world- The 'blood stains' of players who died can hint at how they died as you can watch their last few seconds and  that can hint at how to deal with dangers ahead- You have the ability to leave messages to no one in particular that will pop up in other players worlds and it's up to you whether they are going to be helpful or misleading or just cries of frustration- Other players can come into your world uninvited and try to kill you- You can summon other willing players to help defend against invaders or beat a boss- Things that happen to you or things that you do in your world have consequences in other players' worlds and vice-versa- You can join any of several covenants which grants you some benefits and may strengthen bonds with fellow covenant members- Most lore is to be discovered through various hints during gameplay - you talk to NPCs, read weapons and armor descriptions- 'Beating' the game is only the beginning or your journey. As soon are you 'finished' the NG+ (new game plus) starts which sets you back at the the beginning but with the benefits of acquired skills and capabilities and weapons and with much tougher enemies to confront. And then there's NG++ and so forth.Add to the above a most excellent combat system that from what I see has gotten even better in DS2, the freedom to grow your character almost any way you choose, regardless of your initial class, the most impressive and detailed art displayed on landscapes, architecture, armor, weapons. And that's not all. It's not only other players coming into your game world or you visiting or invading theirs. It's also the game invading our day to day reality through the several Wiki sites and us, real world players taking organized expeditions to fight in organized tournaments or join in some predetermined role playing scenario. The possibilities are limitless and it explains why I've been playing these games for so many years already.Enjoy. And don't let the inevitable setbacks discourage you.THE BLACK ARMOR WEAPONS PACK AND THE SOUNDTRACK DISCSo far, I resisted using it because every single item in the pack should be found somewhere in the game and I'd rather find them myself. It's Okay to have this as an option but it's probably better to use it only if everything else fails, just my thoughts. I am still concerned about the pack's effect on invasions. Hopefully the early players who didn't order the Black Armor Edition or opted not to use the pack won't be at an impossible to overcome disadvantage when attacked by those equipped with the bonus items. Somehow, I thing it's going to be alright.I will add my thoughts on the soundtrack disc once I get a chance to listen to it, and it may take a while because we've been busy playing the game now :)RATINGI'm not going to go pro-reviewer style and assign scores to graphics, replay value and what not. Playing Dark Souls 2 is pure joy to me thus far and that translates into \"\"I love it\"\" which means '5 stars' and that's that._______________________________________________NOTES ON PLAYING DS2Yes, there is no 'easy mode' in DS2 but there are ways to survive even if your reflexes are not lightning fast. You will need some time and patience. So, here's what may help flattening the learning curve a little.- Your initial class matters... initially. True, you can turn into whatever you want eventually, regardless of your starting class and there is one item that helps you rearrange your stats but if you started as a Warrior or Knight and can't make any progress, try a class that can do range attacks. Sorcerer is probably the best and you can develop your required sword-wielding stats as you level up and find some decent weapons too.- Level up a little. The cost of leveling up is not that great in the beginning so if you identify some area where you can successfully deal with the enemies, clear it several times and use the souls gained to level up your favorite attribute such is INT if you go with Sorcerer.- Bookmark the Wikis. There are several very good Wiki sites dedicated to the Souls games. They will eventually map the entire game, strategies, shortcuts and all. At this time you can learn a lot by lurking at the forums and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people there are happy to help if they can.- Get yourself the officialDark Souls II Collector's Edition Strategy Guide. It's been written by some of the better Dark Souls Youtube contributors and it's very detailed.- Search Youtube for Dark Souls II videos that show you how to develop your character, where to go and what to do. EpicNameBro, ManufacturedOpinion, Lobos Jr, A German Spy are some of my favorite stars there and they all love Dark Souls.You will find that, once you go past a sometime painful and frustrating beginning the games opens up and, while still frustrating and painful you will also begin to experience joy and pride in your accomplishments.\"", "Okay, the game is extremely glitchy on ps3, I don't know why, I have got this game on both xbox 360 and ps3, but it is glitching? What am I supposed to do? My character gets stuck every time, xbox 360 version works good, but this is just ... uh!", "This review is mainly for the developers.  Why change something that worked so well?  I bought the PS3 and the 360 version of this game because im a Die-Hard souls fan boy.  I have 4 characters in Demons Souls and DK-1.Let me say i do not use any Glitch's or cheats, i play the game the way it was made to be played.There are 3 factors in this game that could make or break it.Stun-LockingParryingCharacter movements/animationsStun-Locking....In DK-1 if you were stun-locked all you had to do was toggle your weapons/d-pad and you rolled out of it.  In DK-2 if you get stun-locked you are stun-locked, no more toggle.  With my best shield in DK-2 i can get stun-locked and the animation of the stun-locked seem to last forever.  i tried to toggle to no avail.  The stun-lock animation last too long to come out of it and thats If you are lucky enough to break out of it.Parrying.....Oh boy, what have they done.  im the type of player who will stay in the opponents face because i love to parry.  In DK-1 you can time the parry perfectly, with practice.  In DK-2 no way.  I have tried and tested on many enemies and its broken.  In DK-2 say you are in the enemies face, you see him about to swing, i know some enemies animation of swinging are different, but its about timing.  The timing of your characters parry is soooo  slow its useless.  Either the timing or window to parry is broken.  I practiced all day on some enemies trying to parry.  I could not parry not one, not even the slow moving zombies.Character movements.....i made a comment about this in my 360 review.  The best way to test a characters movement is by standing still and using the stick to see how they respond.  My character standing still i move my stick L/R and my character moves so erratic as if they are on ice.  I compared this to my Demon Souls and DK-1 character movements and its like night and day.  What im saying the controls are much tighter in the previous games.  Tighter control, better outcome of character actions.They tweaked the Back-Stab window...Thank God.  Also, they should patch the availability of Human Effigy or at least give Human Effigy after the defeat of each Boss.  Overall, i still like Dark Souls 2 im just not as excited as i thought i would be.  If they patch these issues it could easily be game of the year but right now i can only give it an average rating.Addition:  Getting invaded as a hollow is very cheap.  its bad enough you lose HP and with each additional death you lose even more HP.  I do have the Binding Ring but you still lose HP with it on if you die again.  So, getting invaded as a Hollow is a cheap tactic that should be changed back to the way it has always been.  I been invaded 3 times as a hollow and only once in human form, go figure.  Whats cheap about it is the invader could have full HP and you 3/4 HP.  They MUST change it.Edit: 3/21/14What is the purpose of wearing the Binding ring when hollow? If you die again with Binding Ring on you still lose HP.  I don't get that logic.  i know in Demons Souls when you go hollow you put on the Cling Ring and your HP stays at 75% and it does not matter if you die 10 more times your HP stays at 75%.  Not in DK-2, if you die again with the Binding Ring on you still lose HP down to 50%, smh.  Getting invaded as a hollow even after beating the boss is very cheap.  If they do not change this aspect back to the way it worked either in Demons Souls or DK-1, then i won't play for NG+.EDIT...7/3/14Read my updated review for the 360.", "\"*****No Spoilers. I don't like them. Nobody likes them****** ****** I will update this thread whenever possible******The original Dark Souls was my favorite have I've played over the years in my life. the feel to it was great and it was a unique game. now that Dark Souls II was about to come out. I couldn't let my self to let the chance of playing the sequel of my favorite game go away. I preordred it on Sept. 2013. I was so excited for the game itself And I couldn't wait. I got the game today morning. And I played it for few hours and here is what do I have to say- The game itself has a very different start from its prequel. although similar in the general goal of the game. I don't have a review for the story. because it would be considered a spoiler.****************** TO SEE UPDATES. SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM ****************************************Black Armor Edition and Collector edition content . PS3******Will download through a code included*********-Early access to some weapons and shields. nothing that useful. they're only good for the first 4 Bosses. you will find better weapons after.-My favorite. Dark Souls II dynamic theme. this is on the PS3. I don't know anything about the X360.-Soundtrack CD. nothing groundbreaking. listen to all of them. only 2 or 3 were good-And the  METAL case. nice cover art.( Just careful when you take the game disc out of the case. its very hard to pull it out of its position. so pull it out from one side. if you pull out too hard it might break because the holder is very tight.)Gameplay.- Gameplay is very smooth. very much enhanced from the original. if you think this would be easier than Dark Souls. I will disappoint you. It is not. as far as I've gotten now. this is harder than the Original. but they don't basically throw you into the fire just like they did in the original. there is a long prologue that will make you sure you get the game and its controls. but after that. playtime is over. the real Dark Souls starts. it will be very challenging. and Yes. you will die. A lot of times. am used to that personally. I've died probably around 1000 times in the first. (Considering that I've played the first DS and I still think that DSII is harder than DS is huge. so if your a new comer. expect this to be really hard.brutally hard)- Graphics and frame ratewe all know that the original Dark Souls had some really good graphics. but also. its known for frame rate drops. really steep drops. especially in Blighttown and such places. but so far in the game. I haven't had any major frame rate drops. nothing that I noticed. The graphics are surprisingly better. way better. I liked how they had really nice contrast to them. texture quality is awesome. world details are great and I couldn't ask for more.- Controls and  in-game itemsControls are same as the original for the most part. the only difference I noticed is that you use L3 to perform a running-jump  instead of using the Circle Button. I really didn't have trouble with that. but the L3 button is hard to click while the Circle button is the button your already holding to spring. so its a better option. In game items are for the most part same as the originals. Alluring Skull. Cracked red eye orb. and of course Estus flask. and many others are present in this one as well. so. playing Dark Souls before this is a huge advantage- Character and game GUIthe way you build your character is same as the original DS for the most part. so I don't need to talk to you about it. however. There are 8 character classes in the game. Warrior, Knight, Swordsman, Bandit, Cleric, Sorcerer, Explorer, Deprived. you obviously notice that the Pyromancer class is missing. which is the only thing I am pissed about. Pyromancer class was the best for a start-up. and It was pretty unique and it fits the game very well. I hope they add that to the game later. but since that is too hard to do as the game is already finished. I doubt we're gonna see that happening. but there are still Pyromancies. which anybody can use them if you have the required item. which is the pyromancy hand. game GUI is significantly better than the original. very clean layout and easy to read text font. nice menu and generally the GUI itself is a nice upgrade .What I liked about it.- I liked how DSII is very similar to DS. many games screw up games but going off the topic and the layout of the original. but From Software has done it right. they stick to what people like. made the necessary upgrades and enhancements. but they didn't force any major changes as we usually see in video game sequels. for me. that's always a good thing.Enjoy the game. And I would get it right now. not in few years while multiplayer is pretty much dead. (even tho Dark Souls multiplayer is still very active). this one needs to be played early. and of course. Praise the Sun!***UPDATE***-You can change the running-jump control back to the Circle button from the game options. that's a good thing. And once again. I assure you that this game is harder than the original Dark Souls!. I have a weapon pack and it is still harder.****TIPS****- as a DS player. I would like to give you few tips on this game*First and most importantly. Scan your environment. there are alot of hidden items and walkways that you might miss for hours, days if you don't look. (I just missed the walkway to a place in DSII. went somewhere else that I shouldn't be at at my level. took me hours and I couldn't beat the hard enemies over there. Wondered why. apparently. I should be somewhere else).*Don't rush it. if you rush through Dark Souls II. you will not last few minutes in your run. eventually. you will either, Fall over a ledge. Get backstabbed from behind. or quite simply run into a herd of just too many enemies and get surrounded by them. do the game slowly.*Don't use flasks or any health healers during a close fight it DSII. in DS. if you get hit while drinking an estus flask. you get reduced damage. but in DSII. you get full damage anyways. so it makes it a waste of estus. get to a safe sport and stock on health.*Upgrade the crucial skills first. . I would personally upgrade my Dexterity and Vitality.Don't upgrade the intel or faith. do that later.  (In DS. vitality increases Health, In DSII. it increases stamina.)I will add other tips when I get more experience in DSII. for now. this should be helpful if you don't already think about doing this. mostly logic.****Have something to say****when I say that this game is harder than Dark Souls. I mean its way way harder. imagine that Dark Souls is an easy mode of the game. and DSII is the hardest mode of the game. that might be even less of how hard the game is. its just unbelievable difficult. side stepping is useless. enemies will still lock on you and hit you. even if you side step while running. the AI is really high. it takes about 2 hits to die in the game. Just run past through enemies to find a bonfire. I did that few times. you only have 1 estus flask when you start. 2 when you upgrade for the first time(which you will be able to early). if you had trouble with DS and you hated it and you don't want to get stuck a lot. this is not for you. this game is extremely difficult. even harder than Demon's Souls. Personally. on DS. I've played 3 playthroughs. killed Smough and Ornstein by myself on all of these playthroughs. on the last one I did it on the first try. am not the best or even close to but I consider myself good. this is beyond you can imagine hard until you actually play it. don't invoke an enemy that you see if you don't have to fight him. just run through them. find a bonfire. and then go back and kill them. its nearly impossible to get to different places with killing all the enemies. your fancy footwork won't work here. the AI is high. very small chance it does. I have a weapon pack. which has a good shield and a good weapon. about 3 times better than the startup one. and am getting my but whopped basically. they basically through you into the lava. not the fire. this time.Few people said that this game will get easier when you advance. that's partially true. the game won't get easier. you will get better. even tho DSII keeps throwing challenges at you that you will die many times over and over before winning.So far. about 6 million deaths have totaled in DSII. only 7 days in the game and 6 million deaths have totaled. shows you how hard the game is.UPDATE.THE CURRENT DEATH COUNTER IS AT  over 70 MILLION DEATHS? O.o. I was surprised myself.*****UPDATE***So far. am kind of disappointed at few things'- so far. been through 7 areas. nothing large like Darkroot garden,Basin. ash lake. in DS2. its very compact and it feels like playing a generic RPG in terms of the world. that disappointed me a lot.- the game kind of lost its Dark Souls-ness feel. the game is harder than DS. but it is so different in terms of enemies. mechanics and how the game goes about the story. very different. you will notice that*****UPDATE. MULTIPLAYER and some other issues*******- I was able to reach areas where I can be invaded. and so far its a huge disappointment. Lag is unbearable. I slash the enemy with my sword. he was around for 10 seconds before he actually get staggered and lose damage. surprised because it should reduce lag due to the dedicated servers. horrible so far. needs a quick fix.- My second issue with MP is that. Invasions are so random. you can get invaded while hollow or human. and unlike dark souls.  you see the \"\"You Got invaded\"\" message AFTER the enemy is in the map. few times i got surprised to see the enemy right next to me without a message. also. I've never seen a summon sign so far. Even in the 2011 Dark Souls. I still see people putting summon signs.- People have weapons that I don't even have. I killed 9 Bosses. And I only have about 10 unique weapons. and others have the weirdest weapons that don't exist so far in the game.- Hacking: yes. here we go again. game has some hackers. some naked guy running around and yet he receives less damage than me with a heavy armor with 700+ protection.- Another issue is that so far. I don't have any really good weapons or anything. In Dark Souls. you could obtain some really cool weapons early in the game. but so far. it doesn't seems like it in DS2.- Titanite anything. is freaking rare. as I said. am 9 bosses down. and Yet. I've never found anything but a titanite shard, large titanite shard. and both of these are very rare and limited.- Not as many merchants at all. only 3 merchants that have limited supply. and sell you the worst weapons and armors, items. in the game.- One positive thing I've noticed is that its harder to get a backstab. yes. believe it or not ladies and gentlemen. it is harder to get a backstab.- Again. one thing I didn't like so far is the lack of Mini-bosses. remember how many times you died against Havel the Rock in DS?. there aren't many Mini-bosses or really strong enemies so far. I will update more if that changes.I might need to reconsider my 5 star review. but I will do that when Am done with my first playthough.********UPDATE******- Even though a couple of areas in the beginning of the game weren't the best. there are really nice areas that are awesome. reminds me of DS. challenging areas with really strong enemies. falling of the ledge and all that is here. great. I was pissed off about some things. but this game keeps getting better and better. ****they released a second patch to fix PvP and summoning because it wasn't working**********UPDATE******- The world in this game has such great elements. there are some enemies and bosses that will make  you wonder how great the designer was. few enemies are the best fighting and gamelooking ever. really great game design. level design. especially at about halfway to the end of the game. really great what DSII is bringing to the table.When I say that this game is brutally hard. I don't mean it in a bad way. no. the reason why mos of dark-a-holics play this game because it challenges you. that what this game does. no easy mode. no easy way out. this game will be painful in terms of how hard it is to beat. just like any souls game.******UPDATE.MP*********- as OP as magic was in the original DS. it is even more OP here. MP is basically ruled by hexes(which are Dark Magic. they're called a different name here). and regular magic. many of them just kill you in 1 hit. fast attacks. and too much speed and hard to avoid. I am personally terrible at MultiPlayer against magic or any of its categories. i usually win in physical fights. but other than that. magic is unbeatable for me. if you want to be good at MP. your only option is a magic/hex build. just too strong and am dissappointed. Pyro is as weak as it was in the original dark souls. miracles aren't really intended for PVP. so they're weak anyways. and thats it. Rolling is being made an essential part of this game. shielding with a good shield isn't enough. they made it even worse for me. i like dark souls because it has heavy equipment. but they're (once again). giving advantage to magic users and light armor runners.******Finished first Playthrough*********Played the whole game. and This game is really really good. I liked it tons. but this makes me think. is this better than the Original Dark Souls?. thats a good question. I will play more playthroughs. and we will see. so far. am really disappointed at how unfair and unbalanced multiplayer is. as i said. magic rules in MP (if you played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls. you probably already know that. its becoming a \"\"Souls\"\" game trend. OP magic). trust me. it is. the only way you think that magic is not OP. many say that its not because they're themselves magic users. and they basically don't want to say that they're good players because of the magic. for PvE. I'd have to say that Dark Souls is better. but not by much. Dark Souls II is still awesome. worth playing right now. but I liked the original DS. my personal opinion. I liked some elements in DS II over DS. weapons are way better in Dark Souls II. there are less weapons (I Believe). but the variety of move sets are way more. some of them are awful. halberds and spears have some really weird move sets that make no sense. Best thing about DS II. the Bosses. there are ** of them. few of them you don't need to kill at all. but they give you something. let me put it in this way. unique.******UPDATE 6/1/14*******- I personally gave up on multiplayer. many things are very unbalanced. when I mean unbalanced I mean the most unbalance you can imagine. broken mechanics. your literally in god mode when you roll. even if the sword physically went through you you don't get damaged. its heavily abused. magic and Hexes kill in 1 hit no matter how much magic/dark defense you have. its pretty much the way it is. hitboxes are giant. way bigger than your character model. some weapons will do damage even if they  slice five ft away from you. Poise is practically non-existent. its a completely broken mechanic. causes me. with 150 Poise. probably the highest poise you can reach in this game. TO BE STUNNED WITH A DAGGER. AND A CAESTUS. anything can stagger me which shouldn't happen. renders it useless. parry weapons are broken. for some reason they do damage and the hit is few ft infront of you. and they're fixing things that do not need fixing and ignoring these issues. I doubt them getting fixed, game is riddled. AND I MEAN RIDDLED with hackers. I had few people running faster than light. they were like the Flash superhero. am not kidding they dash around and i cant do anything.Lag is unbearable. its just bad. I get killed with projectiles that are 10-20 ft away from me. i get lag stabbed from 10 ft away. attacking enemies does nothing often. lag has gotten worse.however I recommend staying away from PVP. its all broken. but Co-Op is awesome. putting summon signs to help others beat bosses is my favorite Multiplayer part. I'd spend hours doing it. and you get rewarded with souls. its great. I just spent about 3 hours doing it. its fun. whats better than unlimited boss fights with CPU and Human allies. its awesome. so you might get on that to help you get souls.\"", "Dark Souls 2 is more casual friendly and making game progress early is much easier compared to Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. More frequent random equipment gear and item drops from slaying common enemies. Early bosses are easily conquerable solo with patience. Lots of treasures to be found, areas to explore and bosses to slay. Stationary unique non-invading Red Phantom NPCs make a return from Demon's Souls.Soul Leveling seems to be less soul costly per level compared to previous Souls' games. I'm currently at SL 101 (30+ hrs play time)  and it wasn't too difficult to reach nor very costly up to that point. Soul Level (SL) stats can now be undone from using a rare game item, which means player won't be stuck with bad SL stat decisions for all eternity like in previous Souls' game. My quickest way to gain souls early was by aiding others as a White Phantom by using White Soap Stones. This method also allowed me to experience unexplored areas and boss fights without penalty. (Praise the Sun!)Some merchant items are finite. Can't just buy a bunch of titanite ore and upgrade equipment as desire. I regrettably upgraded my starter class Bandit armor pieces to +3 early in my game progress just to replace them with better merchant armor suited for my play style soon after.Parry and Riposte along with Backstab are slightly more difficult to pull off against improved enemy AI. Most if not all enemies have more than one attack pattern.I can't really speak about PvP much this early in the games release, but I've been summoned as a Grey Phantom 3 times. I've seen a few red soap stone summon signs around SL 85+ and have actually summoned a red phantom to dual. No random invasion yet by red phantoms, but I'm sure that will change soon.Graphically, the game looks nothing like the E3 trailer, not even close. All those early PS3 videos shown were probably from a PC version played with PS3 controllers. Dark Souls &#62; Dark Souls 2 (*2GB HDD mandatory install) in a beauty contest in my opinion. I've put 1000+ hrs into Dark Souls and have been playing it up to Dark Souls 2 release so visually I can tell there's a difference. I'm also playing on a Samsung 55&#34; HDTV and sitting around 6 ft away from my TV I knew right away I was going to be disappointed graphically due to all the new graphics engine hype by FromSoftware. Almost everything seems to have a washed out flat look.For me the jump action being mapped to L3 just didn't feel right so I switched it to O button. I thought FromSoftware should of just mapped sprinting to L3 and jump action to O button which might have felt more natural. I haven't spent much time looking at the control options menu so I'm not sure if it can be changed manually. The jump animation is stiff feeling and looking.As for combat target lock is unreliable against mobs. It doesn't always lock on to the closest target. No improvement with camera when using target lock compared to previous Souls game. Target lock against Godzilla size bosses means a lot of camera blind spots and deaths. Camera gets lost easily against those humongous size bosses. Camera setting can be changed manually I believe. Switching between hand equipments aren't instantaneous like Dark Souls.Some boss fights just seemed cheap and next to impossible alone a la Dark Souls Four Kings (NG+ onward) with a melee build. It's not just contending with those bosses with almost unblockable and difficult to dodge potential one-hit kill attacks, but a mob as well. Two boss fights all in the rat covenant area doesn't seem to allow White Phantom summoning as far as I can tell, because my White Soap Stones couldn't be used. I wonder if it's a bug that needs patching or a part of the game design.Dark Souls 2 is a fantastic game experience and I recommend it for gamers that enjoy challenging combat heavy adventure type games that don't mind some grind.", "I've been a fan of this franchise since the Ps1 days with Kings Field and the first dark souls is one of my favorite console games ever.  But this installment is just a disgrace.  I've already sunk a good dozen hours into the game and I have yet to see a single thing that made me pause and wonder. It seems almost unbelievable in a series renowned for its imagination, but sadly it's true. The settings are generic castles and tunnels that have a haphazard, formless design. The enemies are forgettable - cyclops, zombies , mummies, dogs etc. Bosses are a bunch of random knights and something that looks like the first angel from evangelion. I don't know what happened, but this is a far cry from the other worldly beauty and continually inventive enemies of dark souls one. At one point you are even fighting Viking warriors in 18th century pirate ships. After I saw that, I knew I wouldn't  be playing this game again.  There's really no more I care to say about this generic garbage.", "Sequel to the widely acclaimed Dark Souls and finale to the &#34;Souls&#34; trilogy, Dark Souls 2 puts sword and shield (or sorcery, or hammer, or axe...) into your hands once again in hopes that you can triumph death and despair in this RPG by FromSoftware.  Bigger, meaner, and more epic than either of its predecessors Dark Souls 2 represents a stunning achievement in design and execution.  It welcomes new players with a friendlier tutorial and improved mechanics, but veterans of the Souls series need not be worried.  Dark Souls 2 is brutal and challenging, testing you every step of the way with tough bosses and overwhelming odds.  But Dark Souls 2 is also beautiful and stunning, featuring a world that is well worth exploring every nook and cranny, from dark and dead pits to harrowing civilizations long lost in time above the clouds.  Dark Souls 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, through and through.Story, Presentation, and World &#8211; 10/10/10 &#8211; 10The story of Dark Souls 2 is a fantastical tale of kingdoms lost in time, ruled by monsters and hostile forces ready to challenge the player.  Similar to the previous games, Dark Souls 2 is a mildly minimalistic game in terms of delivering information; the player must explore and discover most of the world himself or herself.  It&#8217;s an impressive story and world, with a staggering amount of thought behind its deep lore and characters.  It&#8217;s a world filled with mystery, where the player&#8217;s imagination is key to understanding and connecting the loose ties between characters and their place in Drangleic.  And I&#8217;m sure the ending will be something discussed by Souls fans for years to come.Dark Souls 2 also features a significant upgrade in presentation values.  Things are cleaner, nuanced elements in character building are more clear and menus are designed with a greater emphasis on ease of use.  It&#8217;s all still very much like the previous games, just refined and improved to perfection.Graphics and Art Direction &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5The world of Drangleic is an epic land ripe for exploration.  Half of this experience, though, is the staggeringly huge variety of places you&#8217;ll visit while on your quest.  Decrepit crypts, castles in the sky, and even the garbage bin of Drangleic itself, the art direction for Dark Souls 2 continues the FromSoftware&#8217;s creative trend in developing horrendous creatures and placing them in a fascinating world.  There are tons of unique bosses and enemies out for your hollow head, and each and every one is animated with a certain professionalism only a Japanese studio could produce.  Along with these disturbing denizens of Drangleic, the places you&#8217;ll visit are equally impressive; not simply because of their design but also the character, increased color pallet and pure imagination every new area brings.  To say that Dark Souls 2&#8217;s art direction is great would be a crime; it is simply stunning, and is one of a kind.Graphically, Dark Souls 2 is superior to its predecessors in many ways.  You&#8217;ll be happy to know that the game runs at a steady 30 FPS throughout (PS3) to 60 FPS (360 version is more consistently smoother, PS3 does hit 60 FPS in enclosed and small areas) and technically performs without a hitch.  The big improvement here is the animations, which have benefited immensely from being motion captured.  Elements of your character react with realism, and enemies feel lifelike and move like they should.  The improved lighting engine creates a surprising sense of immersion (although is not the lighting engine we were advertised last year), and the improved physics engine is icing on the cake (character&#8217;s armor, such as loincloths and hoods flow in the wind and react realistically).  Grainy textures and anti-aliasing problems do occur more often than I would&#8217;ve like to see (and are simply limitations of the Xbox 360 and PS3).  The dumbed down lighting engine is a disappointment as well as the grainy textures and various visual hiccups, making a next gen version of Dark Souls 2 all the more tantalizing.Gameplay and Design &#8211; 10/10 &#8211; 10Where as Demon&#8217;s Souls introduced us to the impossibly challenging difficulty the series is known for and Dark Souls improved the online and flow of combat, Dark Souls 2 has perfected what the series is known for.  Tight and claustrophobic combat headlines the game, while rewarding exploration, online PvP, summoning and aiding other players are all improved.  Dark Souls 2 continues the trend of &#8220;endless tactics&#8221; with the numerous amount of weapons, which all feel distinct and fun to use.  Everything has been improved, refined, and polished.  The classic gameplay is still as challenging as ever, too.  Fears of Dark Souls 2 dumbing down the difficulty and level of challenge have gone completely unwarranted.  If anything, this may be the most challenging of all the Souls games, but also the most fair.  Yes, you&#8217;ll die, get punished because of it, and lose your souls (which can be retrieved within the next life) and your human status, if you&#8217;re human.  But Dark Souls 2, unlike its previous entries, clearly explains the effects of items, materials, and penalties.  You die because you&#8217;re unfamiliar with a boss, area, or unique enemy tactic.  You only come back stronger, more aware of the dangers you will face and more capable to tackle them quicker with more precision.  Of the 245 times I died through my play-through, I rarely felt cheated.  Only a few times (fighting optional bosses and online PvP) did I feel this way.In terms of design, Dark Souls 2 is built with the player in mind.  Beginning the adventure is tough, as is every video game.  Healing items are rare in the beginning, and the Estus Flask only offers a swig at first.  But as you explore this hostile and beautiful world, you&#8217;ll be rewarded with new and better armors, lifegems, status ailment healers, new weapons and sometimes the rare shards to improve the Estus Flask.  Exploration doesn&#8217;t get more rewarding than this.  Dark Souls 2 also offers a huge collection of memorable boss battles; everything from quick thinking to pure dodging skill is required throughout the many, many bosses that stand in your way.  And you will take them all out, I believe in you!  Dark Souls 2 is rewarding every step of the way; from it&#8217;s improved, tighter combat, intricate level design and unique character building this is an RPG that sacrifices nothing it&#8217;s famous for, but rather embraces its flaws and only improves upon them.Sound Design and Soundtrack &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5Dark Souls 2 will immerse you in more ways than one, and that&#8217;s mainly because of it&#8217;s subtle sound design.  Some say the best sound design is one that you don&#8217;t even notice; Dark Souls 2 is accomplished in this aspect.  Swords will clash and spells will be cast, and they all sound great.  The ambience while exploring each area really shines brightly as well.  From creepy distant cackles to hollow and decrepit crypts, everything sounds as it should.  Voice acting, a small part of all the Souls games, has been improved and expanded here and it is all delivered very well.Dark Souls 2 features, hands down, the best score for any of the Souls games.  Each boss fight has it&#8217;s own unique theme, memorable and musical enough to listen to outside the game.  The tragic and intense orchestration and score really highlights each boss fight, making each an assault on the senses and emotions (and the emotional depth of the soundtrack itself is stunning).  And don&#8217;t worry, the classic finale aria is beautiful and thoroughly composed with a purpose.  Mr. Motoi Sakruaba, take a bow.Lasting Appeal &#8211; 10Unlike previous Souls games, once the credits roll there is still more to do.  An altered new game plus allows people to continue to explore past the credits which is excellent for those who want to continue their adventure and clear optional areas.  The game does have the classic new game plus, though, in which you do less damage while enemies do more.  There are multiple new challenges that await players in new game plus, all of which require new tactics and skills.  Aside from that, players can re-spec their characters to try different builds, join and work through multiple covenants, beat optional bosses and work your way through PvP.  Dark Souls 2 offers a lot to do post-credits.Final Score - 10/10Dark Souls 2 took me just about 52 hours to complete (final time - 51:50) and I died 245 times.  Oddly enough, though, every minute within this world was incredible.  Drangleic is a gorgeous and oddly inviting world to explore, and your adventure will take you to the far corners of this hostile place, fighting off monsters and battling players along the way.  It was an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game, and most of all it felt incredibly fair the entire way through.  It is not only one of the best games I have ever played, but it gives reasons for video games to exist.  Only in video games can you receive the same sense of exploration and discovery that Dark Souls 2 offers, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a grand masterpiece and a testament to video games as a medium.(average = 9.8, rounding to 10 based on 20 point scale)", "I own all of the souls series and poured hundreds of hours in the series. I'm 40 hours in and loving every moment. From the variation in stages, to the fantastic music. It's a must play whether new or vet. A solid game with endless gameplay in pvp. N+ adds some spice to starting a new quest which you will see on your own. 5 out of 5 excellent game."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10609723627567291, 0.18932245671749115, 0.12391010671854019, 0.21085301041603088, 0.014278523623943329, 0.1889517456293106, 0.0019341043662279844, 0.16465283930301666]]}
