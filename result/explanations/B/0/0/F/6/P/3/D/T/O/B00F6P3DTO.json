It makes my skin feel cleaner and smoother.  The build quality is very nice; this brush feels solid.  The brush is waterproof and can be used in the shower, which is a great feature.  The charging stand can be considered a good feature unless you already have a bunch of devces that need to be plugged into an outlet in your bathroom, in which case an extra courd may not be all that welcome (the latter is my case).  The brush just vibrates, the disk does not turn at all, yet it seems to work.Although I like the Conair brush, I still prefer my rotary Olay brush for the following reasons.  First, the rotary brush feels like it is scrubbing harder.  Second, the smaller pads of the Olay brush make it easier to use it on the upper lip under my nose and closer to the hair line.  Third, I like smaller footprint of the Olay brush and the fact it uses AA batteries.  I put rechargeable batteries in the Olay brush and I do not have to deal with that extra cord on my bathroom counter.", "I have a face scrubber but not one of this quality. The Conair feels very sturdy, yet gentle enough for the face. The brushes work a bit differently because they don't rotate, just vibrate. It does clean well. There's a brush for body use, but I mainly use this as a facial brush as it's not rough enough for body use. My main concern now is keeping the brushes clean and bacteria-free.", "The Conair True Glow Sonic Facial system has impressed me thus far.  My face and neck feel smooth and without makeup my skin looks cleaner.  I did not feel any irritation from the unit's operation.While I don't quite understand the concept of the brushes not moving and it sonic cleaning, it did deliver.There is no question; there are more expensive units out there and cheaper ones as well.I will update this review should the `stars' change.Pros:1. It is rechargeable and the charge seems to last.2. It has three speeds3. You can use it on face, neck, body4. You use your own cleanser to ensure gentleness and prevent skin irritation5. There is a beep timer which indicates when to move on to a different part of your face.6. Makeup goes on smoothly afterwards.", "The conair true glow came with the body of the unit, two face brushes, two body brushes (since replacements are a little spendy I was pleased with the two each), the pink carrying case, and the charger stand.I really like the submersible quality of the conair as I want to be able to take into the bath or shower. The brush does not spin, so if you're thinking this is one of the spinning brush type cleaners don't buy it. It sort of vibrates on the face.I just used my regular dove body soap and olay facial soap. Both worked fine. Because I'm taking more time with the brush, leaving it on my skin, rather than just doing a quick body scrub and rinse, I would want to use a soap with more moisture so it didn't dry out while I was glowing myself up.The brush rinsed easily. I took off the brush to put the body back in the charger. The brushes have vented covers so you can rest them without them touching other surfaces, and they will dry without being gross.When I come out of the restroom I notice my skin is pinker than when I just wash, and when I put on my moisturizer it seems to glide more smoothly. I do feel this is getting rid of dead cells and leaving healthy skin behind while encouraging good blood flow to my face and body.", "I love the Conair Facial Skincare System. I had the original one and used it for two years. It is very similar to this one except that it had only one speed and was a bit heavier. On the new one, I use the high speed and it is great for the skin. It stimulates the blood flow, exfoliates, and cleanses exceptionally well. I recommend it very highly.", "\"I had been using a regular, old-fashioned facial cleanser, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser which was super-cheap (I'm a tightwad,) but it required batteries, wasn't for use in the shower, and was kind of abrasive on my skin.  I wanted to upgrade but, honestly, I was a more than a little leery about a hundred dollar facial cleanser.  Well, this system quickly proved my doubts wrong.When I saw that the brush head didn't spin, but just vibrated, I thought that it would never clean my skin - once again - wrong!  As I was using it I kept trying to convince myself that it wasn't working, but my arguments faded into contentment.  Not only did it make my skin feel wonderfully clean without the abrasive effect of my last unit, it also provided a remarkable, gentle face massage.  When I was finished my face was totally relaxed and my skin glowed!The fact that it is rechargeable and can be used in the shower required no effort for me to love - shouldn't all facial cleansers be rechargeable and waterproof?  It just seems kind of dumb for a unit not to have these features, but so many of them don't.  I also love that it comes with two sets of the brushes so I don't have to worry about reordering them any time soon.Honestly, for the price, I didn't want to love it - I wanted to confirm my opinion that there is no need to spend this much on a facial brush system, but, kicking and screaming, it completely won me over.  I am now a believer - this is the best facial cleansing system I've ever used and I'm never going back!PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\"\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire\"", "This Conair Facial System comes with an electrical charger, a charging stand, a carrying case, two facial brushes, two body brushes, and the hand unit.I received this yesterday and per the instructions charged it overnight. This morning it was fully charged and I used it as a facial scrubber and body scrubber. This unit is submersible and can be operated in three speed modes. Overall operation is very basic. You can apply soap, facial cleanser, or body cleanser to the brush and operate at whatever speed you feel comfortable with. Since I have used a facial scrubber for nearly four years, I operate at slow or medium speed. When not in use, the unit needs to be returned to the stand for charging.When I used this, I noticed that this did not feel any different than the cleanser I use every day. The manufacturer's instructions are fairly basic and easy to follow regarding operation, cleaning the brushes after each use, and general maintenance.The end results after cleansing are predictably good. My skin felt smooth and soft. It did a good job of removing dry skin and other facial debris, and my winter dried body parts felt moister and devoid of dry skin build-up.Overall, I thought this set compared favorably with my far more expensive Clarisonic Mia in most respects except that the body seemed to be made of a cheaper and more brittle plastic. I wasn't going to test out the unit by dropping it on the hard marble floor, but this still seems fairly sturdy.This is what you can expect from using a facial brush on a regular basis. Under most circumstances your skin will be brighter, cleaner, and devoid of black heads and blemishes. Pores will not be clogged and your skin will look nicer. I usually apply an oil free moisturizer after cleansing before bedtime. I have used three different units at different times and intervals and the results have been uniformly good so I think the real issue here is cost and whether you want to spend more money for essentially identical results.I gave the Conair 4* because I like it, but thought the construction could be better considering its listed price of $100.00.", "Want your face to glow? Try this. Its cheaper than the major competitors brand and delivers wonderful performance. Just understand this unit is a bit different than some.. you have to move it around to get the &#34;scrub&#34; effect if you want that but its simple and very very easy. It definitely outshines the cheaper versions that do rotate. I have seen a serious improvement in my skin.", "\"I bought my first Clarisonic, the original Mia, over two years ago and was instantly smitten.  It only has one speed, but that is all I really needed.  Last month I bought the Aria.  I liked the USB charger and the fact the unit was lighter than the Mia, an important factor when traveling.  This item is similar in size and shape to the Aria, but feels much cheaper (and it is). I like the stand, which the Aria has but not the Mia 1.  The charging system is not as nice.  The Mia only requires you to place the charger near the front and it magnetically attached.  The Aria uses the same system, but gives you the option of putting the magnetized area in a charging stand.  This just plugs in, which would be fine. However, I was concerned with the warning in the instructions not to unplug the unit from the wall without also unplugging it from the base as the unit will otherwise discharge.  My bathroom configuration makes it difficult to do so.  I could just keep it plugged in to the wall and put the brush down without using the stand, but the stand is what I like best in this unit.Like the much more expensive Aria this offers three speeds. I don't really see any reason for this and always put them both on \"\"high\"\". The Aria has me do this once and it remembers the setting.  This Conair requires I hit the button three times every time I use it (starts at \"\"low\"\").  Quickly hitting the button once to turn it off works for the Clairsonics; this would only change speed.  It didn't take long to remember to hold the power/speed button down longer to shut it off. Still, I find it a bit irritating.This came with four brushes, two face-sized and two a bit larger and intended for body use.  That is much better than Clairsonic.  The units seem to do the same thing - move quickly and get all of the crap off your face.  However, I find these brushes much harsher than the Clairsonic's.  The ends of the bristles feel sharper and just all around not as nice. The Conair probably cleans just as well, but my face feels a little roughed-up afterward.I much prefer the Clairsonic.  They are more expensive, although Clairsonic's web site currently has their Mia 1 on sale for the same price as this Conair.  This Conair is still better than anything outside of Clairsonic that I have tried, but it really doesn't hold a candle to them.UPDATE: After a dozen uses the brush doesn't seem as sharp.  The speed stays set at your selection as long as you let it shut off automatically.  I still find the beeps (to tell you to move to another part of your face) irritating.  The Aria also beeps, but this is loud and sounds like a smoke alarm's failing batteries.  I still much prefer my Clairsonics.\"", "I've had my Clarisonic for a little over a year and I love it.  I have experience with this kind of item -- I was using the Buff Puff back in the 80s and then I've used almost every invention since then.  The only thing I've stuck with is the Clarisonic.  I can't go a day without it and sometimes I use it twice a day.  For reference, my face is extremely oily and I've had acne since age 2. I got this item because I wanted to see if there was something out where the brushes were less expensive to replace.  This is not it.While this is a great face cleaner, the difference is in the brushes.  With the Clarisonic, I admit that I waited a very long time to purchase replacement brushes.  I didn't notice the difference from a 9-month old brush and a new brush since the difference is gradual over time.  But when I broke down and got a new brush, I could feel the difference immediately.  I wouldn't say that the bristles were like pins, but I could definitely feel the &#34;sharpness&#34; of the new brush and my face looked better than ever.Here's the thing -- the Conair brush bristles feel like the Clarisonic bristles after those 9 months.  It still did the job!!  Don't get me wrong, but the bristles felt softer, they didn't feel as penetrating.  After swabbing my face with toner there was nothing on the cotton, just like with the Clarisonic.So for me, while this does do the job and clean your face, it's just not the same as the Clarisonic.", "When I first tried this out, I thought huh... how can this possibly get my skin clean?  Nothing turns, there's no movement of the brush head.  But, after using this for several weeks, I am more than pleased with it.  My skin looks radiant and feels so smooth.  It's really evened out my skin tone, especially around my nose and my cheeks.I had been using a product with a brush that rotated.  While it cleaned my skin nicely, I found it was little rough and I didn't like to use it every day.  With this Conair skincare system, my skin only looks and feels better the more I use it.  It's really a great product and it's easy on my skin.The on/off button is easy to push with wet hands and I can securely hold it in the shower.  I like that it beeps to tell me when it's time to go to the next part of my face.  It's quick and it works very well.", "I had the clarisonic, and hated it.  This is basically the exact same thing, but for 1/2 the cost.  I actually like this one better because for the price it comes with a fair share of brush heads (body, sensitive face, regular face).I keep it in my shower, and use it about 2-3x a week.TIP: I also keep a mini spray bottle of rubbing alcohol in the shower with it so I can sanitize the brush head before each use.So far, I have only charged the battery one time - and I've used it probably 12-15x so far. Great battery life!If you're looking for a solid clarisonic alternative, this is it.", "I have a similar skin care product that uses replaceable batteries and a spinning brush system that I was quite pleased with. When I saw that the True Glow system is waterproof and can be used in the shower, I was very excited about trying it.Included in the box is the device itself, 2 facial brushes and 2 body brushes with covers, a charging cradle with a/c adapter, a pink fabric storage case and a users manual.Of course, I turned it on immediately to check it out and I was so disappointed to find that instead of spinning, the brush just vibrates. How can that clean my skin as well as spinning brushes do? However, I set up the charging cradle and set about charging the unit fully so I could begin using it properly.There are 3 speeds of vibration to choose from and Conair suggests starting with Low speed until your skin becomes used to it then gradually increasing the speed as needed/desired.I have to say that the vibrating brush actually DOES clean my face and body every bit as well as the spinning brushes did and it also exfoliates and minimizes pores and leaves my skin feeling unbelievably smooth and soft. I use the True Glow on my face and body in the shower every morning and then on my face every evening. I haven't had any problems with skin irritation so far, although my skin is used to this kind of cleaning.Conair cautions you against applying any pressure while using the system. They have also incorporated a timer into the device to avoid over-scrubbing your thinner facial skin. It beeps every 10 seconds, prodding you to move to a different area of the face. After 6 beeps (60 seconds) the unit shuts off. This is the only thing I dislike about the product. I can see it might serve a purpose but because this system is also for use on your body, it's very annoying having to turn it back on every 60 seconds. I wish that the timer could be turned off because that would make this system perfect, IMO.As others have mentioned, the vibrating vs spinning brushes also make for less water splatter. This is great in the evening when I use it at my sink. I no longer have splashes all over the mirror and back splash! That may sound like a small thing but when you think about an item you'll use daily, less mess and cleanup is a really good thing.The brushes are kind of expensive, IMO, since they are about $15/ea at this writing. I'll be interested to see how long they last. Still, this is a wonderful cleansing system and being able to use it in the shower makes it worth maintenance expenses such as brushes.", "This is a great skincare system for people who have never used anything similar. You will notice a result. Give it a couple of weeks, but it'll get there. I'm not saying this is a miracle worker or anything, but it really does help. My skin(combination dry/oily) feels fresh and smooth after each use, and I don't even use it that often, 2-3 times a week. I absolutely love that it's waterproof and I constantly use it while in the shower (so much quicker and easier). It's rechargeable which is another great feature and it comes with three types of brushes for the face and body. The actual device feels a tad on the cheap side and I'm not sure how long it'll be before I have to replace the brushes, hence the 4 star rating, but I'm very excited for this product. It's not at all harsh on the skin, but I still feel nervous about using it daily, it just seems overkill. But I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants more of a healthy glow and clean-feeling skin."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06957851350307465, 0.07423560321331024, 0.07304790616035461, 0.06965690106153488, 0.0722154825925827, 0.08082813024520874, 0.07085598260164261, 0.08101140707731247, 0.08379938453435898, 0.06516458094120026, 0.055099427700042725, 0.06663215160369873, 0.06289773434400558, 0.0749768540263176]]}
