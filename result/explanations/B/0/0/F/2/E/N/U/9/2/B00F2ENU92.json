So I'm reviewing the beefier version. This is a good device. Pros include the built-in kickstand and long battery life.  The screen is very good but not outstanding. There are 2 negative traits you should be aware of. First, the sound doesn't get that loud. Many things can affect the device  output volume, including the volume at which the music was recorded, whether the user has found all the volume increasing measures on the device, etc. Even with a song that was recorded loud, with the manual volume control at max and the software at max, the music was hard to hear well in the adjacent room. Still, it was clear so that's something to be said. Secondly, and this is arguably more important. Lenovo needs to rethink their micro SD card process and feature. I do appreciate there is a micro SD card slot. However, it is next to the SIM Card slot. There is a very faint outline above where the micro SD goes, but it is not clear to all users that is the right slot for it. When you push the micro SD in, you're not sure how far you should push it. It actually goes in ALL the way underneath the lip of the device slot. To get the card out was another issue. I thought it wouldn't come out and was stuck. I had to call Lenovo and they prepared to return the device for me (trust me, you never ever want to have to call Lenovo - their customer &#34;service&#34; sucks). After some fiddling, i figured out on my own that you push the micro SD in a bit further and then it pops out. The Lenovo tech support didn't know that. Not easy to get the card in or out, and not something you could change frequently with ease. The device is nearly a perfect tablet, if these 2 updates could be made.", "\"I've been using a small (11.6\"\") laptop computer for the past few years, for a) lightweight web surfing while sitting on the sofa watching TV, and b) for email, web, movies, and music while traveling -- which happens 4 to 6 times per year, often on very long flights. I was tired of the weight of the laptop (about 4 lbs), and the abysmal battery life (5 hours if I was lucky). So, I've been shopping for tablets for the past year, and the Lenovo Yoga is the first one to meet (or exceed) all my specs:1) Must be 10\"\" (smaller is just not suitable for watching movies).2) Must have battery life to match (or come close to) the 16-hour flights I take to Manila.3) Must have a 64GB  SD expansion slot (because my movies take around 1GB each, and I also need room for music, photo transfer from my digital camera, etc.).4) Must be Android (because Apple iPads don't meet condition #3, and I have a distaste for Windows after too many misadventures on my laptop. Plus, there are many more apps available for Android).The Yoga 10 is the only I found that meets all of these requirements -- and it has \"\"bonus\"\" features that I now consider to be a requirement for any tablet I own:5) Must have an easy-to-hold side \"\"handle\"\" that converts to a tabletop stand (aka the Yoga's \"\"kickstand\"\" and battery cylinder).6) Must have a bluetooth keyboard that acts as a cover for the tablet screen when not in use.As other reviewers have mentioned, some magazine/online critics have knocked the Yoga's screen resolution. For me, and my use, it's plenty good. Yes, there are some displays out there that are more spectacular, and sure, I'd like that to be available on the Yoga -- but **not** if it means a) I have to give up any of my six requirements, or b) pay a $200 or $300 premium. (In other words, I think people who are hung up on pixel count are the same kind of people who like to brag about 600hp in their cars; OK, that's cool, and you're the baddest, but when are you going to use it?)I love my Yoga. Not only have I cut out 3 lbs of hardware weight when traveling (my laptop vs the Yoga), I can also leave behind about 3 lbs of magazines that I used to carry along -- because they're now loaded electronically on the Yoga. Battery life, with my kind of use, is as advertised. Just spectacular.I have only two criticisms:On the optional Lenovo bluetooth keyboard, there is no way to disable the trackpad, and it's very sensitive. So, while you're typing, I guarantee that your hand will unintentionally brush the trackpad and cause your cursor to end up someplace on the screen where you didn't expect it. My fix: I used non-permanent adhesive to fit a thin piece of cardboard over the trackpad. This deadens it enough to prevent those accidental cursor moves. But it's dumb that Lenovo doesn't have a kill switch built in.Second -- and this is pretty trivial -- I wish the Yoga came in different colors. I mean, I like the silver color better than all those black and white tablets out there, but I'd like to see some more personalized options, like blue or red or yellow. Just my opinion.Btw, even though I love love LOVE Amazon, I bought my Yoga directly from Lenovo, because a) I got the 32GB version for only $20 more than Amazon's 16GB model, and b) Lenovo had the keyboard in stock at the time of my purchase, and Amazon did not.PS: It's obvious from the questions asked about this tablet that a lot of people want a SIM car slot, so that they can connect to the web via their cellphone carrier. This was not a requirement for me, because I only want to connect via WiFi. I don't even have a data plan on my cell phone. However,  I do understand that it's important for some, and the Yoga tablets sold in the US currently can't do it; the slot for the  SIM card is blocked. Maybe this will come in future versions, as I understand that Yogas sold in India (and maybe elsewhere?) do support 3G. but right now, the only way to connect to the internet is via WiFi.\"", "Love the new style with built in stand.  Tablet works great and does all the things I need it to do.  I would not spend over $600 for a tablet and this is perfect for me, my lifestyle, and my budget!Wish the keyboard was sold at Amazon too but I got it from Lenovo.  Unfortunately when you press the single quote button on the Keyboard/cover (which is sold separately at Lenovo) it prints a comma but I plan to contact Lenovo about that Today.I still do not plan to return either one of them.  Way to go Lenovo!", "\"First of all, I have had all versions of the iPad, have used the Samsung Galaxy 10\"\" 2014 Edition, and have the Galaxy Note 3 phone.  So, my comparison is based on owning and using all of these devices.  With that said, I am somewhat underwhelmed by the current version of the Lenovo Yoga 10 B8000 tablet.  However, I suspect the HD+ version (due in April 2014) will address the shortcomings.  Regardless, there is a market for the Lenovo Yoga 10 and here's my review of it:Display - despite comments suggesting otherwise in the Amazon reivews, I think the critics got this right.  The display is about as good as a 1st Generation iPad; just not very good by today's display standards.  The lack of pixel density becomes apparent when trying to read small print.  Although many apps/sites allow for text size compensation, some don't and this is where it becomes most apparent.  With larger print, the screen resolution is passable.  Surprisingly, video plays fairly well on this device and should not disappoint.  As some critics have commented, colors don't seem very vibrant.  If you are familiar with the latest Samsung devices or iPad Air, there is simply no comparison to the display the Yoga 10 provides; it is significantly inferior to my eyes.Touch Screen - This is where, at least on my device, the Lenovo Yoga 10 falls short.  I find that typing an email on this device results in a 20% error rate caused by missing characters that I thought I clicked.  I find myself constantly back-spacing to fill in those characters; quite frustrating and time-consuming.  I experience no such issues with any versions of either the iPad or Galaxy devices.  By the way, it is my understanding the touch screen on the Yoga 10 can be re-calibrated through its Recovery Console (entered by holding down the Power and VolumeUp buttons for 30 sec).  Unfortunately, my Yoga 10's Recovery Console menu dispays in Chinese.  By the way, if you try entering the Recovery Console and it also displays in Chinese, just press and hold the Power button for 10 secs or so until the unit normally reboots again.  I was unable to identify any 3rd party apps from the Play Store that could effectively adjust the touch screen settings.  Also, the touchscreen while using on the launcher/menu seems quite normal.  My issue is only when typing.WiFi - Although others have reported weak wifi signals, my tablet was able to detect and draw wifi signals that equaled the distance of the Samsung and Apple devices.  So, I was pleased with this result.Build Quality - is very good.  The glass screen and back plate (made of plastic and aluminum) are sound.  The device is thin, light, and feels sturdy.  The hinge on the kickstand is quite tight and difficult to open using one fingernail.  The kickstand is also made of aluminum; I'd rather see this made of a composite material to avoid the \"\"metal blade\"\" sound when coming into contact with a hard surface (minor detail).Kickstand - I like it and it works well for me since I like reading while sitting at the kitchen counter.  As others have reported, the stand could be a little bigger (being addressed on the next HD+ version).  The kickstand won't be of much help on a surface like a bed, but, the cylinder-shaped handle is a nice feature for that.  Again, it may be difficult for some to open.Battery Life - Maybe I just run too many apps and sync too many accounts, but, I just don't experience the same awesome battery life others report here.  My experience is that it's on par with Samsung's and Apple's devices.  An annoyance during the charging of this device is that the power button slowly flashes, thus creating a slow strobe effect if you charge it in your bedroom at night.  This was not well thought out by the engineers.  At least make the display of the power button light a settings option.Performance - Is surprisingly good.  If you have a fast internet connection, you should be pleased with the results.Launcher - As others have mentioned, replacing the stock launcher with Nova or a similar launcher is an improvement and fairly easy to achieve.  Just download it from the Play Store, make it the default launcher, and the rest should be intuitive.Sound - Is surprisingly good on my device.  As good (if not better) than that found on the Apple and Samsung equivalents.Value - My ratings above are exclusive of price.  However, I picked this up for $198 here on Amazon and at that price point, this is a very good value.  At $250, I would wait for the HD+ version which will likely carry a $350 price when introduced.Conclusion - I admit I'm a tech-snob and sure my review here will irk others who gave this device a glowing review.  Lenovo deserves credit for thinking out of the box and creating a form factor that I believe can catch on.  Reported improvements in the upcoming sequel should adequately address some of the shortcomings of this current version.  I think this is a good device, especially at the $200 price point, for people who want to browse the internet, read articles, and watch videos.  For those who value high-end screen resolution and expect a touch screen to perform flawlessly, in my opinion, this device is not for you.\"", "I like this tablet alot. I would buy it again. You can't beat the price and the service that Amazon has. It's quick and there's room for a lot of apps. There is an upgrade in settings for KitKat.", "For the price, this is not a bad tablet.  It's a little on the heavy side for me and the screenresolution is not the greatest.  The text is zigzag and is not very HD.  The price is rightand it has allot of neat features.  I'm waiting for my Kindle HDX 9&#34;, to check it out.  'sorry.", "This tablet is not the best in screen resolution but you won't notice much difference anyways. It's fast and very cool looking. You must get the keyboard cover for this tablet because then you'll have the complete package, which looks very nice and make the whole thing looks like a real notebook. No complain here :)", "\"In my first review I raved about this tablet.  I loved it!  But its dead now.  It had asked me to permit the OS to update one day about a month or so ago.  I allowed it.  Came back later and my Lenovo would no longer boot up.  The Lenovo logo would come on the screen but that was it.  It would remain like that until the battery went dead.  I tried to reset it but all that comes up is a little android guy on his back basically saying that no operating system can be found anymore.  I was both disappointed and devastated.  On every other device that Ive ever bought from Amazon Ive purchased the 1-3 year service agreement.  On this Lenovo I overlooked that.  So now Im stuck with a very expensive paperweight.  You'd think that by purchasing a name brand item that this kind of thing would not happen very frequently but now that Ive read some of the other negative reviews I see that it does happen much more than it should.  I bought my Dad an Afunta 10.1\"\" tablet and his is still going strong with no issues in sight!  Paid less than half as much for the Afunta and it seems able to do everything my Lenovo could. The battery life isnt as good, of course but its not at all bad either. Guess you know what Ill eventually be replacing my Yoga with-and a service agreement.\"", "In days where all Android tablets look similar, the Lenovo Yoga is a blow of fresh air with its thoughtful design. The different standing points make it very comfortable to use in different situations.The other outstanding feature is its battery live. It is really what you need to be on the go without worrying if your gonna make through the whole day.At nearly $ 250 now, it is a great deal."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[7.616270886501297e-05, 0.0025463115889579058, 0.001520239980891347, 0.30769938230514526, 0.20689615607261658, 0.002618642756715417, 0.21194903552532196, 0.00044942559907212853, 0.2662445902824402]]}
