The shine, the color, the shape all come together to make this eye candy.This comes with a huge diffuser and it makes the airflow gentle and even. Lately I've been finding the power of the air hitting my hair from these super powerful dryers to be more than is good for my hair, so this diffuser creates a much needed buffer. This seems fairly weighty but it dries so quickly I don't need to use it long at all. And the ion technology really works. It's no gimmick. If you aren't using a dryer with this technology you are missing out. My hair is glossy and smooth from it as clouds of invisible ions surround my hair to tame it.This also has a concentrator and my hair is incredibly smooth and straight instead of its usual wavy frizzy mess. It looks like I used a straightening iron on it after this with the concentrator attached. I usually stick to only the diffuser however since I am being extra gentle to my hair these days. I also like the wavy look I get with it. I've never seen a diffuser this big but it dries my whole head in record time while letting me scrunch in the waves and body. My hair doesn't get heated and beaten, it is gently molded into a natural shape.This has low and high heat and three settings of airflow, plus a cold shot button to set your hair into place. The handle and buttons are ergonomically designed for perfect hand feel. The pictures don't do this justice. If you love a really gorgeous purple, not too dark, not too light, with tons of shine and black accents you are going to love this dryer, aside from that huge diffuser and ionic technology. I recommend this dryer highly.", "This review is from: Conair Infiniti Pro Dryer AC Motor / Salon Performance Styling Tool, Green (Misc.)This is one of many Conair hair dryers and certainly one of their best. By using price signals, it compares favorably to other Conair models.* Wattage - An interesting discovery in the hair dryer industry was the fairly tight range of wattage for the better hair dryers. Conair has many hair dryers that can use 1875 watts, including this one. The extremely popular and more expensive Babylis Pro Tourmaline uses 1900 Watts.* Heating element - The better ones are ceramic and tourmaline. Ceramic elements are made of among other things clay, and this coats internal parts resulting in far infrared heat heat surfaces quickly and evenly. Tourmaline is a costly crystal mineral that generate only negative ions and is considered better than ceramic - but it all depends on how much tourmaline is actually used in the product and most use too little to have bragging rights.* Attachments - Concentrator and diffuser. These are large standard attachments and the hair dryer itself is large.* Settings - 3 heat and 2 speeds, and a cold shot button to lock hair in place once one is finished with the heat.* Removable filter - This is pretty new for inexpensive hair dryers. I think it shows that the hair dryer can be expected to last a lot longer than previous ones. I like that.Summary:1) I like this hair dryer a lot and see the results - faster to dry hair and definitely with less frizz than previous models.2) This is one of the better models available from Conair.3) Beware that whereas tourmaline is even better than ceramic, similarly priced tourmaline dryers use so little of the crystal that it's not going to produce actual tourmaline results.", "I got this dryer to replace my old one that was cracked and falling apart. Overall I am very happy with this product. The theme of all of the reviews pro/con thus far have been:PRO: DRIES HAIR QUICKLY  CON: HEAVYI must concur. This dryer is so powerful that if you have thin or fine hair I would recommend using on the low setting. If you use the high setting you will probably end up with a bees nest of a hairdo. For those of us with thicker hair that takes forever to dry, this blow dryer is wonderful. I can dry my hair in the half the time. The concentrator nozzle is nice when I am actually styling my hair and not just doing a quick blow dry. It isn't the quietest dryer I have ever owned but that being said it is amazingly quiet for the amount of power it generates and I can dry my hair in the bathroom without waking others. I haven't found the fizz free function to be true. I have frizzy hair and still require all of my anti-frizz products in order to tame my hair. I have owned the dryer for about two months and the only con is that it is rather heavy. I am strong and have a lot of upper body strength and because my hair dries in half the time it's ok to be moving the big dryer around. I definitely wouldn't take it in my luggage on a trip.Overall, great home hair dryer. Recommended for people with thick hair who are sick of taking an hour to dry their hair in the morning.PS Mine is purple!", "I wasn't impressed with this hairdryer. The biggest turnoff was the weight, its so much heavier than the hairdryer i'm used to using, AND its not as powerful. you'd think more mass would equal more power, but not when it comes to this one against my goody(http://www.amazon.com/Goody-Heat-Flash-Blow-Dryer/dp/B006MRM2TC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396414992&sr=8-1&keywords=goody+1911532) the goody wins. The goody is a little bit bigger...but most hairdryers are. not exactly something i'd ever describe as portable or petite. The color is pretty and it is made from more solids materials, but I'm happy with my $15 dryer.", "\"Have you ever wondered what a hairdryer would be like if it was rebuilt by Tim Taylor, the over powering host of Home Improvement's \"\"Tool Time?\"\"  Well, if I recall the show correctly, it would have a pull start gas engine and it would start something on fire.  But I think even Tim would love this hairdryer, which is big, heavy, super-powerful, and well designed.It produces a lot of heat on the top setting (3 heat settings), and has a super powerful fan on top of this.  We've tried a lot of hair dryers, and this definitely produces the fastest results.  It also has all the bells and whistles you might expect - tourmaline ion tech, which allegedly reduces static and frizz, a diffuser and a concentrator.If, like Tim, you want more power, then I recomment the infiniti pro - it's a powerful dryer at a good price.(Edited to correct Tim's name, as suggested in comments.  I guess I should have paid more attention!)\"", "The Conair Infinity Pro Dryer is a good solid hair dryer that has good heat control, is lightweight, and dries hair quickly.  For several years now, I've used a much older Conair Ion Shine  to dry both my and my kid's hair.  While it got the job done, over the years I noticed that it seemed to be taking a bit longer to dry everyone's hair.  The Inifiniti is a vast improvement over the Ion Shine.  The unit works much more efficiently, and if it's as durable as the Ion Shine is, I can imagine using the Infiniti for many years to come.  My only gripe about this unit is that it's shockingly purple colored.  Thankfully the kids love the color while I love getting their hair dried fast!  Highly recommended.", "I am editing my review to demote this dryer from Five Stars to One Star (would love to give it zero).  Pretty serious opinion change, yes?  This is WHY: I just had to CUT my hair out of this dryer.  About a centimeters worth.  Now, sadly, having occasional hair strands grabbed by the dryer is one of the hazards of having very long hair.  However, because of that, I'm careful; also, I have NEVER had so much hair pulled at once!  The dryer wasn't even on high.  It didn't shut itself off after grabbing the hair, either.  (Not that I wasn't swift to cut it off myself!) And this is what realllllllly got me.  The  back vent cover wouldn't snap off (which it should, and I thought it did at my initial inspection.  Had it snapped off, perhaps I could have at least tried to gently extract my hair.  I had to cut it.I hate you, Conair, I really, really hate you.I still love and will continue to use the fabulous diffuser.My original review, where I once gave it 5 full stars, appears below:I've reviewed other hairdryers.  I've given other hairdryers solid reviews.  I have even reviewed other Conair Infiniti's which were essentially the same as far as the hair dryer itself.  However, THIS one is my FAVORITE!And frankly that has very little to do with the dryer itself (which is solid) but it's the DIFFUSER!!!!!!!!! I picked this up not expecting it to be much different from my other dryers (it's not) and my other diffusers (and it IS).  The diffuser IS different.  It's huge!!!  That photo of the diffuser is NOT an optical illusion.  It's big.Advantages of a large diffuser:  More curl, less frizz, faster drying.  If you have curls, GET THIS!  Not only does it have a large surface area, it has more air vents than most, and it has the vents on the spokes, which I prefer.It does also a good concentrator for days you may straighten .(Conair makes good straighteners, I think, I'm not sure why they seem to work a teensie bit better than some out there, but if you are straightening you gotta use a concentrator!  This one is good.)The dryer itself has good power.  It's well-weight-distributed for your hand, though it's a tad heavy.  Contains a good range of temperatures, with distinct cool/warm/hot settings.  The cold shot is truly cold, and works well when held for a long time (unlike some that become warm).  I do wish the cord were longer (I notice cord length especially when diffusing as it takes so long that I attempt to multitask).Simply.Adore.the.Giant.Diffuser.  It is 6 inches across, where my previous diffuser was a more petite 4.5 inches.", "First of all, this hairdryer is beautiful. I love the glossy finish and the very nice purple color. The hairdryer itself is lightweight but very powerful. It heats up very fast (within a few seconds of turning on) and the fan is very powerful. Hence, it drys my hair very quickly. The filter is replaceable which is nice. Overall, excellent product. Price is a bit higher than regular hairdryer but you get what you pay for.", "I have been using an ionic Conair Infiniti for a few years now. It is still running great. This new version of the Infiniti addressed some of the complaints I had with the older version and for that, I like it much more. The buttons are easier to switch on/off and to change settings. (the old one I had to dig my fingernail in to slide over because they were flat buttons) The new version is lighter weight, and feels more comfortable in my hand. It is also not as loud. The ionic technology is important for drying my hair quickly and without added frizz. The former Infiniti was a good dryer and has lasted me for many years, but I have switched to this one and like it more for the improvements.", "This has a nice weight to it (light) and is a cool color.  It does a nice job drying my hair, even though it doesn't get as hot as I would prefer.  My only gripe with the dryer is the placement of buttons - it seems way too easy to switch the buttons from hot to cold and back again.  Would be nice if they'd thought of putting the buttons just a tad lower or higher. Otherwise pretty bueno.", "Right out of the box this dryer feels sturdy and fits well in your hand. The buttons are placed at the finger tips for easy selection of temperature (cool, warm, high), air flow (off, low, high) and the quick push Cool button. While it is slightly heavy it is powerful. My wife has been using this everyday since we got it and likes it better then professional model she has. It has a removable lint filter for easy cleaning that prevents lint from getting inside. And it looks really cool, too!", "I love this hairdryer!For years, I've avoided using hair dryers because the heat always made my hair frizz wildly, but the cool settings took much too long to dry the hair.  The Infinity Pro manages to strike a balance, with a cold setting powerful enough to still dry the hair quickly while the heated settings doesn't frizz my hair up nearly as much as other models.There was a bit of a learning curve with this dryer because it is large and a bit heavy.  It took me a while to figure out how to maneuver it to reach my roots and create the styles I desired.  But it was definitely worth the effort, because my hair has never looked better."], "Gamma": [0.004609023220837116, 0.032194968312978745, 0.04505208134651184, 0.07197469472885132, 0.03449174016714096,
