Once I paired the 35mm Zeiss to the A7 for street shooting I was stuck with it.  It was raining terribly in NY for 2 days and everyone hid their cameras away when it started to rain.  I still kept my A7 out and continued to shoot.My only complaint with this camera is that it doesn't have the amazing dust and sensor cleaning as the E-M5, and the shutter is really loud.  People definitely know I'm shooting them and in NY it's normal so no one really cares.", "If you are in the market for a large sensor mirrorless camera, the Sony doesn't disappoint.I was fortunate enough to receive an A7 for review shortly after buying one myself.  Since I received this A7 for review, I returned my A7 and bought an A7R, so I could compare the two.What the A7 has that the A7R does not?+ electronic first curtain shutter+ 1/250 max flash sync speed+ much shorter EVF blackout+ much less shutter lag (time from focus complete to shutter opening)+ PDAF on sensorWhat the A7R has that the A7 does not:+ Higher Resolution sensor+ Better high ISO performance in RAW (1/3 stop)+ Better sensor flare resistance+ Metal front plate and mode knobWhere to start with the Sony A7? It is a really great camera. Full frame image sensor for stunning image quality, excellent grip for shooting all day long, light weight for a light pack. What more could I ask for? The only real issue is a lack of lenses for the larger sensor size.Build Quality:I notice the build is slightly on the cheap side for the price, it really doesn't feel any better built than the NEX 6. Paint and feel of the buttons could be a bit better, sealing could also be better around the lens mount and compartment doors. Paint in buttons is sort of cheap looking, not applied that well. I wonder how long grip material will last. That being said, the camera is really nice to hold. The grip is excellent and can easily hold the camera with just your finger tips, although I wouldn't recommend that.Viewfinder:Turn off image review. Again, turn off image review. It is an EVF and the preview image will closely resemble the final image unless you are using flash. Again, turn off image review. Okay, now that I have said that 3 times I will say why. Image review ruins EVF experience. With image review off the EVF is back nearly instantly after a shot is taken and you can frame the next shot. Basically OVF like response. With image review on you are stuck looking at an image in your viewfinder until you can half press the shutter and you lose a second or so trying to get your viewfinder back and another second trying to find your subject again.The EVF is amazing. This is the first mirrorless camera where I use the viewfinder almost exclusively. This is because it is very high resolution and produces a nice what you see is what you get image, and even manually focusing can be done precisely at f/1.4 with the viewfinder alone, no focus peaking necessary.Response time is quick, although there is a fraction of a second delay before the viewfinder turns on when you put it to your eye. Again, try not to think of this as an OVF, instead try to think of advantages given by an EVF and understand its limitations. In super low light for example the refresh rate will drop substantially, but this is in light levels where you have troubles with OVF as well.Autofocus:Much improved over older cameras, especially when using newer lenses (35/2.8, 55/1.8, or 28-70). In mid to low light levels, performance will drop dramatically. The AF assist light in this camera is somewhat helpful in some circumstances with this camera as it is in a better location and not as blocked by the lens as it was on the NEX cameras.Remember to keep contrast on your subject in low light. Taking pictures in low back lit lighting is asking for bad photos and poor focus performance. You need some fill light, use a stand light in your house or a bounce flash if you have one.In good light I get superb focus performance (fairly comparable to my A99, but with much better accuracy). Predictive focusing is still a bit of a problem, but you can work around this with the short shutter lag in the A7 by depressing the shutter button all the way in AF-S mode and it will take the shot nearly instantly after it is focusing, so you can usually get the first shot in focus, which helps a lot.I have had no issues with accuracy, if you are having problems it might be your technique. Select a smaller flexible point size (see the book) so it doesn't overlap the background, use the Eye AF (defaults to center button, but you can change it, only works if face detect box is visible around subject). Try to avoid strong back light if there also isn't some contrast on subject. Try not to lean into or away from subject (or make sure they don't sway) while using a lens like 55mm f/1.8 with extremely shallow depth of field.Performance:I could basically shoot as much as I wanted without hitting buffer limit in RAW. Obviously if you shoot bursts or very high rate shooting for a long period of time you will have issues. With Image Review off, EVF performance is excellent and blackout is minimal.Battery life is poor, keep an extra or two laying around or use a USB battery pack to top off your camera when it isn't being used.Image Quality:Excellent, but not as good as A7R. The A7 RAW image quality is not quite at other Sony 24 MP full frame sensor levels, but is close. I think the sensor loses a bit of performance for added PDAF support and appears to have similar performance to the A99, but 1/2 stop better because it has no translucent mirror that the A99 always shoots through. If you use the LAEA4 you should see similar performance to A99. I have no issues with image quality.  The A7 has an issue where if the sun or bright light is in the frame you will get some additional reflections from the sensor, and this is greatly reduced with the A7R.Controls/Customization:The camera is extremely customizable. You can adjust about 10 different buttons to almost any function. I would suggest spending a couple hours going through every menu option. First set one of the buttons to act as a help button, and then you can press it on every menu item and read what it does (basically same information as in book, but much handier). After you learn the camera you can assign the button to something useful again.The menus are a huge improvement over the NEX, but still kind of a jumble. If you are used to the A99 they combined many of the photo and video functions on the same menu pages which is highly confusing, but at least they are linear and you can go through them pretty quickly, unlike the NEX.The shutter release is a soft touch shutter, and it is very sensitive. Try not to bump it. I think most people will really like the feel of a soft touch shutter after you have used it for some time. Positioning is a problem for some people, but if you have an old 70s/80s film camera they are almost in exactly the same spot. I have no issue with it, and actually like it.Bottom Line:This is a really great performing camera. It is 2nd best in mirrorless class image quality (A7R taking the lead), and a really nice set of professional level features. All it needs is more lenses, and Sony is promising a lot of those as soon as they can. Get the A7 vs the A7r if you want a quieter shutter with faster flash sync speed and a bit faster focus system in good light. Get the A7r if you want higher resolution, a little better build materials (front plate is mag-alloy instead of plastic) and slightly better high ISO image quality when viewed at same print/web size, and presumably video quality is a bit better on A7r too.If you shoot with older lenses the A7 is amazing. With the full size sensor you get a lot better performance out of the older adapted lenses on the A7 due to the lower resolution requirements vs APS-C, and the focal lengths look as they should with no crop factor. The size of the body is perfect with the mid to small sized SLR lenses.I have never been so happy with a camera purchase.  If I was being hyper critical I would rate it 4 stars, but for a review on this site I don't think that is fair, it is a 5 star for sure.After using both cameras extensively, they are the same camera body, with very different uses.  The A7R is definitely the landscape/detail oriented camera, and the A7 the more general purpose and event camera.", "\"Updates 12/24/13:+ raw noise not much different then d600.  I shoot indoor without flash a lot.  (bar, events, etc)  So I need larger sensor and prime lens.+ NFC works very well.  I now own the nexus 7 with nfc.  It connect very fast and you don't have to enter the passcode.+ Sony updated their remote software.  The one that came with the software won't change iso, aperture, shutter speed and touch screen focus point on the cellphone or tablet.  Sony fixed all this with verion 2 updater.  To update you mush connect to your modemn have a psn account to download.  Under application, pick playmemories when login, there a apps to update.  I also installed flickr and direct installed (facebook is a option too.+I am giving this a 4.5 for fun factor but very frustrating to figure out all the options int the beginning.* Remember to put the camera in airplane mode to save battery if not using wifi, nfc, uploading.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a nice little expensive camera and by no means a dslr replacement.  All that, I think it is a 7/10, one being the high price and then some performance factors and few features I wanted wasn't there.  I am a photo enthusiast and carry my camera around quite a bit (having a sony nex3 for awhile).  My main system and an all my lenses are Nikon.  I own the D600 and 2 other dslr bodies and 9-10 lenses for it.  I am looking for a small, portable, street camera that can maybe take Nikon lenses; as I have no plan on buying into another system.  I also looked into the fuji x-e1 and 2, x-m1 series, Olympus em-5, Sony nex5t and 6, Samsumg NX300.  I shoot RAW and use lightroom 5.3 instead of jpeg and the slow and odd sony raw converter.Why I picked the A7 kit:+ Body Design, small body, great layout.  I actually like the look, not perfect but good.+ Not a DSLR (got 3 of them, wanted something different)+ Full frame sensor, so there will be little to no drop-off in IQ (image quality, not brain test)from my main camera the d600.+ Phase detection AF (sony nex3 was contrast and it didn't focus very fast or well in lower lighting situation).  The A7 PDAF focused quite fast indoor, but not so good on moving objects (tracking) as I would like to believe in a PDAF dslr.+ tilting screen and wifi, this is 2013 and not 2010.+ I already have a nikkor to nex adaptor already so that is good.+ focus peaking (the area is highlighted when in focus for manual lens, I picked yellow) the nex3 didn't have and it is necessary to have when using manual lenses these days.+ The kit lens isn't that bad, it is good for a kit lens standard and much better than the nex kit lens.  I think they were a little lazy in the design.  Looks like an alpha lens stuck on a nex (there is no nex vs alpha, but this is obviously a nex mount).  There is almost a 1\"\" shim space between the mount and rear element.  Lecia has short/ compact lenses on their camera, this a milc too.  There are lens distortion with this kit lens, so I turn on the lens correction in Lightroom.+ Like Nikon, I can use aps-c  lens on a full frame.  No real benefits, but it is nice to have that option.+ Same dynamic range and color profile I am used too.  Sony makes sensor for some Nikon, fuji, hasselbald, Olympus, Pentax....+ Startup is quite fast or instant like dslr, 1st gen nex3 was ridiculously slow.+ 1/8000s shutter speed, my d7000 had it but the d600 was only 1/4000s.  Very useful in sunny places and a large aperture lenses.+ A lot of AF points covering most of the screen except the edge on PDAF (100% for CDAF), I don't need to shift and recompose some of my shoots.  Just move the AF point around.+ Movie/ Video mode, wow the kit lens is good for something here.  It focuses very quietly and fast.  Video looks very smooth, I'll always like avchd, I think this can do 1080p.  But in low lighting I use the manual 50mm 1.8d Nikon lens, it is very easy to use with zebra (highlight blowout pattern) and focus peaking (I use yellow to show me what is in focus).  Well my manually focusing skill is beginner for now.  I uploaded few youtube samples, see link in comment.+ Mentioned layout again, I have all the major settings programed, there are 3 programmable buttons.  Changing the setting is a breeze.Negatives:- Cost, I don't think it should cost 60% more than the Nex 7.  Most people aren't going to buy a $2k camera.- IQ (noise), at first it looked odd when viewing raw in Sony raw converting software (too much noise reduction or something), I got a hold of lightroom5.3 and it looks much better.  The other thing is I was using the kit lens and had to hyper drive the ISO and it produced a lot of noises.  I then used my Nikon lens to get the larger aperture, but I still  think this sensor might have a tad more noise than the Nikon D600same 24mp full frame sensor.  I am still learning Sony a7 so my settings might not be right yet.  I have uploaded some samples to flickr of dark indoor and outdoor situation, see link in comment below.  In regular well lit, sunny situation you can't tell too much of a different between many cameras.  I reevaluate this after I get more familiar with this camera on the higher iso and maybe compare it to the d600 side by side.  I don't want to be a technical photographer; by from my experiences, said the a7 has a little more noise.- No touchscreen, com-mon, this is a pure digital camera.  Just because the pros don't need it, doesn't mean most of the people buying theses don't?  I like the Samsung nx3000 and Sony nex5t touchscreen, fun and easy to use.  You can turn it off if it offends you.  Maybe I am used to cellphone photography.- C2 button is hard to press, because it is recess and close to the eyepiece.- I didn't like using the Nex3 at all, so was ready yo give up on the NEX family.  While it is still mostly the same, the small things like PDAF really help make things funner to use.- No IBIS, Sony is trying to steal Canikon shooters, give us some ibis for our manual lenses.- No battery charger and battery drain fast.  You can keep your DSLR on all day and it won't drain that much.- PDAF while faster then CDAF is still not the same as dslr PDAF.  I uploaded some car panning at night, the A7 couldn't do it.  See flickr link in comment.- There are no playmemory apps (software used to control and share photo on the A7 by phone) for window phone, only apple and android. I am the few people that has a window phone.  I do have an android tablet and got it work/control the A7.  You can take photo, but you can't pick the AF point by phone.  Didn't see where you can change the setting either, hopefully somebody can write a good app to have more controls sicne it is an open source.- Sony raw software isn't as quick and user friendly as lightroom, I have better IQ from processing my RAW from Lightroom 5.3 beta.  Actually it looks like a mess with the sony software. (edit I looked red I but I re-calibrated my monitor so it looks fine, tad bit of noise reduction added, I think editing the raw and saving to raw is slow compared to lightroom non-destructive raw editing)- no pop-up flash (there has been 2x I could have used a builtin fash, not going to walk-around with a external flash), they could of placed a flash on the big sony triangle head.Neutral/ notes:* Comes with no software cd, you have to download it after plugging your camera to the computer.* I prefer OVF, but this EVF is quite good.  Colors are still more saturated then real life, but it is getting better.* Won't mind GPS (none here), sometimes you don't recall where you were at.* The fps didn't feel snappy, so not an action/sport camera here.* Virtually no lenses for this system.  The 28-70mm kit and 35mm.  Sony knows most people will be using adapter for this camera.  Look up metabone if you want an autofocus adapter.  I am just manually focusing it with focus peaking.* You can hear the shutter as other has mentioned, maybe street photographer trying to sneak some shots might be worry, but I am not.* AF assist light is quite bright (reddish), I shoot indoor wutie a bit so I need all the AF help.* How do you turn off the AF beeping?* You can't edit the EXIF data in the camera to include your email and copyright info like for Nikon.  Or I haven't found it yet.I actually ordered the Fuji X-e1 about 2 months ago and after I heard rumors of the x-e2 and A-7 with PDAF, I returned it.  I thought it was tad sharper then my d7000 16mp, but it didn't wow me like all the reviews people posted.  X-e1 color were a little flat, since it has more green sensor then red or blue like in bayer.  I just didn't know much about Samsung NX300 except playing with it at the store.  I passed on the OMD-5 smaller sensor and it had a body size almost the same as the A7.My background is I shoot digital and some film.  I have a sprocket rocket, Nikon FM2, Bronica film camera.  I been asking Nikon for a milc and they only provide the 1 system that seem boring to use and has a tiny sensor.  Another thing Nikon has been stubborn to add is a tilting screen, touchscreen, wifi on higher end models.  They came out with the first dslr with movie mode, the first tilting screen on the d5000 series,  an android P&S; camera, but didn't really place it most of these features on their prosumer or enthusiast models.This camera is definitely a keeper for me now.  Like how it feels in my hand and it is different from the dslr.  Brings the fun back into photography.  I will look into the noise and probably give it a  4 stars later.  While the A7 looks a little silly with the long kit lens, it look awesomes with the Nikon aperture ring lenses on it.  I didn't want to spend 2k on a new camera with a good d600 I already had, so held out for a week.  But in the end I knew I had to get it and very happy with it (not looking into the big hole in the bank account)\"", "I'm a Big fan of Sony cameras, I have several for different purposes. I've mainly been using my Nex-3 and Nex-5 cameras for capturing fun photos, nature stuff & other things to amuse myself and my Nex cameras have never let me down.This weekend my new Sony a7K arrived  and I've spent this weekend playing with it and my mind is blown.It's a small, light weight camera that feels great in my hands as I'm going around taking some fun nature shots and the detail of these photos has shocked me. I never knew the dirt that the plants are in that I'm shooting could look so fascinating. My other cameras have 16 MP resolution and the a7K's 24.3 MP makes a mind-blowing difference.It's like when I had an incredible Sony standard def TV and I saw the Sony HDTV for the first time, there was no going back, it was what I must have.While I will still use my Sony Nex-3 & Nex-5 for out and about simple fun, the Sony a7K is what I will be using for my important projects.I photograph original artwork for consideration in art shows and I want the highest resolution possible. I know that the Sony a7K will capture the amazing colors and incredible rich detail that I need to show in these paintings.I Love that the Sony a7K is fully compatible with my E-mount lens from my other Sony cameras.This camera is so easy to use and I can tell that as my using the Sony a7K continues, I'll continue to to grow with this incredible camera, I have so far to grow but it's not a scary camera to work with.I really love the great battery life that the battery delivers,shooting all day and there's still power there for me.I LOVE this camera and I look forward to capturing the sumptuous colors and the incredible fine details in the subjects I shoot with this amazing camera.", "\"The short version:Sony's compact, full-frame, mirror-less, interchangeable lens camera body, with a respectable kit lens, produces wonderful photos. Its performance isn't always quite on par with similar DSLRs and doesn't have many dedicated lenses available, but it is smaller and priced more competitively. It can also make use of a broad range of legacy lenses from other camera systems, making it quite versatile.The long version:The Sony a7 is the lightest and smallest full-frame sensor, mirror-less, interchangeable lens, digital camera currently made. It is a first, and as such, has some growing pains. But on the whole, it is an amazing, fairly compact camera system -- with a full-frame sensor! You get DSLR-like performance with this more compact package in most instances. Aside from improved overall responsiveness (speed between shots and focusing) and image quality, what this means for the uninitiated is that you'll get a much shallower depth of field, especially when the subject is close and the aperture is low (open). This is ideal for portraiture and creates very pleasing bokeh (out of focus background elements). The a7 produces much less noisy images than compact digicams in low-light conditions as well.Camera aficionados and photography experts are more likely to know what they are getting when they choose this camera and may be reading these reviews just to see what other user's experiences have been. I'm preface this review by saying this is my first full frame DSLR style camera. I've been shooting with SLRs since the 80s and have owned a wide range of digital bridge and point-and-shoot cameras (including other Sonys), but never stepped up to a digital model -- though I have used them. I recently purchased aFujifilm X-S1 12MP EXR, and aside from the longer range of its fixed lens and some aspects unique to it, and I have to say that the a7K surpasses it in almost every other aspect. The menu system here is a bit more complex than on point-and-shoot models, but a power user wants that in a nearly $2k full-frame body. I'm sure that there is better glass out there, but I find the provided 28-70mm kit lens quite good. As it now stands, there is a limited selection of lenses made for / optimized to this camera (4 currently), so if you want maximum flexibility, you would probably want to go with a full-frame Nikon or Cannon body. They will be significantly larger though, not mirror-less, and likely more expensive. Also, with adaptors, the Sony a7 can make use of any number of legacy lenses you might have laying around from your film SLR days. You will have some cropping issues, but this is a wonderful option to have.The a7 has a TON of neat features and options I could comment on, but will try to be brief and speak to the basics. I will likely revisit this review after further use, and when I have the opportunity to use it with different lenses. So from the perspective of a first time DSLR user, here are my likes and dislikes:PROs:* Exceptional image quality. The 24MP CMOS sensor is fantastic and produces good JPEG images and even better RAW files.* Exceptional build quality. This camera is solid in the hand and has some weatherproofing.* Respectable kit lens for the cost, though I wish it had a bit more zoom.* Top-notch HD movie capture in a variety of formats and quality options. Built-in microphone and headphone ports.* Great ergonomics. The a7 is a pleasure to use. Yes, there is shutter noise, but there is something very satisfying about that 'click' when you snap off a shot.* Extensive customization options. I've still not fully explored every setting this camera has to offer. Auto mode will produce good photos, but the a7 shines when you customize the settings.* Very responsive. While startup times vary and previous DSLR users may find them tad slow, focusing, shot-to-shot and read times are impressive (with a fast SDHC card - I recommend theSanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC). This may not be the ideal camera for a dedicated sports photographer, but I've had good luck shooting my daughter's night soccer games. The focusing system is superior to that of the a7R.* Bright, hi-res, 3\"\" tilting LCD. I wish it swung side to side as well, but it still adds flexibility when shooting. The a7 also offers a very accurate on-screen electronic level.* The 100% coverage, 2.4M dot OLED is what I prefer for shooting. It's an amazing digital viewfinder and is proximity activated.* In camera battery charging. Some may complain that the a7 doesn't come with an external charger, but considering the price of the camera, getting a 3rd party external charger with 2 extra batteries is quite affordable (and recommended - mine is theWasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger).* 24.3 MP resolution. That's enough pixels to allow for cropping and high quality print images. A low enough pixel count to make the most of the sensor, work well in low-light, and not have (overly) unwieldy file sizes. I prefer this to the 36.4 MP of the a7R.* Cool Sony mode options such as Panorama and HDR, just to name a couple.* Wi-Fi and smartphone connectivity.* The option to use any number of lenses made for other camera with the purchase of the proper adapter.CONs:* No built-in flash.* Lack of lenses built to make the most of the a7's sensor. As of this writing, there are only 4, but more are promised soon. Sony E-Mount lenses are compatible, but there is some cropping.* The multi-level menus can be a bit complex until you are really familiar with this camera.* Autofocus is usually accurate and fast, but not always and less so in low light.* I've found battery life to be decent, but not on par with similar DSLRs. You want to have backups for a full day of shooting.* With the provided 28-70mm kit lens, it's not ideal for macro photography.* It took me a while to get iPhoto to recognize the camera when attached so that I could directly download photos. You'll need to play with you connection settings in the menus.Who isn't this camera for? Those looking for a pocketable camera, folks on a tight budget, serious sports photographers, or previous full-frame DSLR users expecting the same quality and speed that they are used to in this compact body.I'm really enjoying using the Sony a7. It looks, feels and acts the part of a high-end, well designed, quality modern camera. As a person who has primarily used bridge cameras and smaller digicams over the course of his digital career, I'm quite happy with the manual focus kit lens Sony provides. I wish the 28-70mm lens was slightly faster and had a little longer reach, but given the a7's 24.3 MP sensor, I can crop a bit if need be. It has thus far been very versatile, performing admirably for portraiture, landscapes, sports and close-up photography. Video too! It will be months before I've fully explored all that the a7 with this lens has to offer, but I can safely say than for it's performance, form factor, flexibility and cost, it is the best camera I've yet to own. As I mentioned before, two items you may want to immediately purchase with this camera are a fast and large memory card, and additional batteries with a charger. Both of those items set me back under $100. A camera bag to hold your equipment is a good investment as well. For the a7, a good budget option is theEvecase Universal Black/Grey Large DSLR Camera Travel Case/Bag with Strap. For those looking to use 3rd party lenses with the a7, keep in mind the added cost of the adapters.I'm giving the a7 4 stars for it's minor imperfections, but in reality I \"\"love it\"\", so perhaps should have given it 5. For the sake of objectivity and quick reference, I'll stick with 4. However, I have a hard time imagining anyone who has only used fixed lens digicams up to this point not loving this camera and the photos and video it produces. More demanding photographers may feel differently, but good luck finding a new full-frame body AND kit lens anywhere else at this price.~ Kort\"", "I wish I could give the camera 5 stars and the lens 2.  I took off one star for Sony shipping this with a kit lens that is subpar for this level camera.  I won't go into a long review but I disagree with the DPreview website who claimed this is one of the best kit lenses they've tested.  The lens itself is not up to the task of being mated to a full frame 24MP camera.  It is soft at wide open apertures and it has moderate to heavy chromatic aberration near the edges.  The Sony software (both their raw developing tool and the in-camera JPEG's) process the photos to fix the chromatic aberration automatically so that might be what is complicating the reviews since the processing is made to hide the poor performance of the lens.  In the end though the processing, while it tries to address some of the lens issues, adversely affects image quality at the same time: images are just not as sharp as they could be with a lens that is good optically and doesn't require all the &#34;massaging&#34; to eliminate problems.The camera itself is a beauty!  I've not been a Sony fan in the past but I am now with this camera.  Controls are laid out in a very logical and usable fashion.  IQ and high ISO performance are fantastic (if you stop down the lens a bit).  I did not run into the auto ISO issue posted by another reviewer: I find the ISO speeds chosen by the auto ISO to be right on par with what needs to be used for the given lighting conditions and focal length.  It chooses an ISO speed that is appropriate to get the needed shutter speed based on lighting, aperture, and focal length of the lens (more tele zooms require higher shutter speed).I do find that Sony overprocesses both JPEGs and raw files (with their raw software) particularly at high ISO.  At anything over about ISO 3200, there is so much noise reduction being applied that some edges look almost like smeared clay.  The way to avoid this and get the best IQ is to shoot raw and use a third party raw developing tool that is compatible with the A7/A7R like Qimage Ultimate or Lightroom.  There you can decide what type and how much (if any) noise reduction to apply after developing the raw photo.  The camera appears to produce fine noise grain and not a lot of chroma noise which is nice because the grain is easier to deal with and can be preferable over heavy noise reduction that waters down edges and detail.Overall I believe this camera will be a game changer.  There are a multitude of benefits when you lose the age-old mirror and allow the main sensor to actually SEE what it is shooting!  You get better exposure control and far more accurate focus: gone are the days of front/back focusing due to the focus sensor being a separate sensor from the image sensor.  Having come from a Panasonic GH2 and having used (briefly) an Olympus OMD-EM1, this shoots like a full frame version of those cameras but with better control layout and ergonomics.  It just needs a bigger selection of lenses, particularly an &#34;affordable&#34; zoom that is of better quality than the kit lens.", "Most people are raving about the Sony A7r and do not mention this camera. But I think that for the majority of people, even those who rave about the A7r, this camera would be good enough. The full frame sensor produces extraordinary images and I have been able to use the camera successfully with many older lenses, however the Sony Ziess 35mm lens is incredibly sharp. Unless you are making very large, mural size prints, this camera will deliver and you can save the $800 difference in price and buy another lens.", "\"I am a professional photographer/graphic artist but will not be reviewing this camera from the perspective of comparing it in any way to specialized pro gear. That would not be fair to any camera or anyone considering the A7 as it fits into its own niche. There are dozens of reviews on the internet written by authors who have a long and extensive experience in publishing camera reviews. I suggest you do a search and read them all from beginning to end, especially the very in-depth analysis at dpreview. Then of course, consider the many reviews posted here at Amazon, some of them very well written and, as always, some of them based more on personal opinion and brand preference than fact. This review will strive to hit the most important things you should know when considering this very unique camera and justifying to yourself the worth to you at a price very close to $2000.WHAT IS THE A7?When a new product category is innovated it is hard to peg it into a nice neat box. Putting aside its price for a moment, the A7 is neither a pocket camera, bridge camera, enthusiast DSLR nor pro-grade shooter. As a full-frame, small body, interchangeable lens mirrorless camera it stands in a very uncrowded field. It is too large to appeal to pocketcam fans, way too expensive to match the super-zoom bridge cameras on price, about 3X as expensive as popular enthusiast DSLR's with kit lenses and all-around lacks almost everything a pro photographer looks for, particularly ruggedness and easy access to a wide variety of industry-standard lens mounts and other accessories. Yet it is being cited time and again as one of the most exciting cameras of the era and for good reason. My assessment (backed by Sony) is that the A7 is directed at someone who is serious about image quality and willing to give up things like fast burst shooting, ultra-fast auto focusing, i.e. the classic Leica rangefinder photographer who doesn't have a Leica budget and isn't ready to give up some technological assistance quite yet in favor of strictly manual photography. For many it might be considered an ideal street camera because of its unassuming looks and shoot-from-the-hip capabilities.WHAT IS THE BEST APPLICATION FOR A CAMERA LIKE THIS?One answer might be \"\"if you've got the bucks for a top-end toy, go for it\"\".  Most people do not have an extra $2k laying around for a camera. The question might be better answered that the A7 is not a do-all, perfect solution for everyone camera.  The ideal target user is one whose creativity demands the image quality of a full-frame sensor but does not intend to use the camera in the rough and tumble world of photojournalism or sports photography. Someone who can take the time to compose and adjust a camera manually and finds that freedom lacking in point-and-shoots or bridge cameras and despite the higher image quality of prosumer DSLR's finds them too cumbersome as a compact takealong street camera. For me it has finally satisfied that niche I needed and wanted to produce images the way I see them and imagine them without the compromise of tiny image sensors or the bulk and complexity of my pro gear. In other words an oversized pocket camera created for perfectionists.WHAT ARE ITS STONG POINTS?The physical size of the image sensor is what makes this camera sizzle. Regardless of \"\"megapixels\"\" there is simply no way to produce the best possible imagery using smaller than full-frame sensors. The abundance of manual controls and customizable presets, interchangeable (and sometimes superb) lenses, a smooth-feeling zoom and focus ring, a best-in-class electronic viewfinder (so good you forget it's not optical), excellent ergonomics, solid and water-resistant body construction and electronics that don't get in the way of creativity go a long way toward making this camera worth it's hefty price tag.  Once you get past specs and opinions and get it in your hands you get a satisfying feeling of the glory days of photography and an urge to push it to its limits.WHAT ARE ITS WEAK POINTS?I often tell my students that a camera doesn't make a photograph, a photographer does. And the A7, as a photographic tool, give a creative photographer much of what s/he needs to create superb imagery. But in the physics of camera design there is no such thing as perfection. The most egregious error that could be made is to waste the A7's potential by never exploring beyond the kit lens. Don't get me wrong, the kit lens is very capable and when purchased in combo with the body is very attractively priced, but it imposes limitations on a camera that is so much more capable.  Putting aside what I do for a living and any comparison to high-end pro gear if I never took the kit lens off the camera I would be missing out on much of what Sony had in mind in designing it. While Sony is in the infancy stage of offering quality lenses specifically designed for the A7/R (as of this review's date there are 4 with more to come), the brilliance of the design plus the ingenuity of after-market manufacturers translates to there being several affordable adapters that permit you to use many of your existing lenses (even non-Sony lenses) or specialty lenses that may fit a particular need of yours.OBSERVATIONS:* Slightly slower startup time than the typical DSLR but nowhere near unacceptable* Shutter sound a bit loud for stealth photography but not as bad as some reviews would have you believe* Battery life is just okay, there's a lot going on in this camera electronically and the battery just doesn't have the stamina to keep up with it. Hint: keep the WiFi set to the airplane mode and your battery life will increase substantially.* Stiff shutter button (the detent feels great but the pressure to release is just a little strong)* Too easy to turn camera off when trying to use front control dial. This is probably the most serious design issue I've found. Nearly every time I use the camera my forefinger either shuts the camera off when I am trying to use the front dial or, possibly worse, accidentally changes a setting while I am reaching for the shutter release. Simply put, the front dial is in the wrong location* My personal preference would have been that Sony designed the manual focus switch to be a mechanical switch/button rather than a menu item. The autofocus is pretty accurate but not as accurate as my eye and brain. It is a multi-step process to switch to manual focus (which is focus-by-wire, by the way) ... neither being a positive feature for a camera in this league.* But there is a nice happy ending to the focus button issue which, after a little menu setup, can work out quite well. The AEL button doubles as an AF/MF button. It's placed in an easy-to-access location and simply what it does it permits switching momentarily from MF to AF to take a quick \"\"read\"\" then taking control back over from there to fine-tune the manual focus for the shoot, OR it will momentarily switch from AF to MF to let the camera do all the focus thinking and first and then switch to MF (which gives a temporary enlargement to assure perfect focus). I know it sounds a bit complicated but it is brilliant in actual use.  Personally I'm getting in the habit of letting the camera tell me what it thinks is right but taking quick corrective action if I suddenly decide to switch to a different point of focus. PS-there is a third focusing option which is Direct Manual Focus. Similar to both of the above the camera defaults to autofocus but when the user turns the focus ring they can take direct control to touch-up focus.* Sony's downloadable PlayMemories software is very consumer-oriented, but it is necessary if you wish to take advantage of the camera's built-in WiFi. It is good for quickly downloading a few files but snail-like if you have more than about a dozen files to download. Its worst feature is by default it wants to search your hard drive and load every photo it finds into Sony's album organizer. You can turn that feature off but it switches on again automatically every time you connect the camera. In my case I have about 100,000 photos stored on several connected hard drives and PlayMemories insists it knows better how to organize them than me. It doesn't.BOTTOM LINE - PICTURE QUALITY - DOES IT DELIVER?If you read the paragraph above you understand that for my non-business (i.e. family time, vacation, fun excursions) usage I have finally migrated from a decent enthusiast DSLR to a this nice mirrorless camera.  The ultimate bottom line is that sensors, processors and other components have simply gotten better and the A7 is simply more capable than my 60D (which was equipped with one of Canon's best lenses rather than a kit lens). When used with a Leica prime lens on the A7 I can accomplish some photographic magic that transcends marketing hype. I have this sense that nothing mechanical (other than the misplaced front dial) about the camera is holding me back. Let me edit that ... the camera, mechanically, is not the most capable for high-speed sports photography and will sometimes struggle with autofocus (which I rarely use) in low light. But as a manual camera for exacting creative projects the A7 may rank as one of a handful of best-ever photographic tools and when used as such its little trivial foibles simply melt away. The A7 is especially adept in the role of a \"\"street camera\"\", one that does not impose or intimidate and is capable of a good degree of stealth photography due to having the tiltable live-view view screen on the back as well as a very good eye-level viewfinder.Here are some random thoughts that did NOT directly affect how many \"\"stars\"\" this product earned:* The packaging, for the selling price, is very low grade to the point of being cheap. I don't feel Sony adequately protects a $2000 product nor presents it in a way befitting its price.* There is a comprehensive instruction manual included in the box, but it small with a tiny typeface and printed on the cheapest paper imaginable.  At the time I received my camera there was no comparable PDF file at the Sony website available for download.* There are no software disks in the box. Sony directs you to a special website to download their Personal Memories software, which is very consumer-oriented. More difficult to locate is Sony's unique RAW file converter, developer, editor available at their website as well as a third bit of software. The RAW file editor crashed and would not work. That gave me my first opportunity to deal with Sony's tech support which was inadequate, I kept getting off-topic responses from them to the point where the rep simply gave up and I had to request the issue be escalated, and as of this review nothing has been able to fix the issue.* There isn't a starter SD card included in the box. That is not a big deal because anymore most people (especially those who buy a $2000 camera) want to carefully select exactly which card they feel best suits their needs.* Sony obviously hit the mark with a perfectly sized, ergonomically excellent, lightweight camera body. How much better would this camera have felt if the kit lens was about the same overall volume in size and about the same weight as the body?  Of course it's possible, especially at Sony, a kit lens that is half the size and weight would have put this camera over the moon.* I have owned over 100 film and digital cameras. I strongly suggest that despite your skill level you live with this camera set to the \"\"Auto\"\" position for at least the first few days. During that time take note of your shooting habits before ever delving into the menu system. There are a staggering number of different configurations you can assign to each \"\"Custom\"\" button plus dozens of other user-defined setups. Resist the urge to start setting them all until you get the feeling for the overall camera. Then proceed slowly. I assure at some point you will feel this camera is an extension of your brain if you take the time to set it up properly.* If you are used to having a built-in flash you will have to get unused to it and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Pro photographers don't use built-in flashes for a very good reason; they can absolutely ruin what would have been a great photograph. Take the opportunity to learn to work with light and if there is no light, add it judiciously rather than have a xenon bulb explode a torrent of light flatly and directly at your subject.* Anyone reading this should be clear that virtually any camera stumbles when using auto-focus in low light. The A7 is actually better than many others in low light for two reasons ... it has probably the brightest AF illuminator I've ever seen, it's been able to focus on someone's face across a darkened room.  Use it if you want to autofocus in low light conditions. And the manual focus has some features that make it easy to use and accurate in near darkness, specifically the aforementioned superb viewfinder and the ability to temporarily magnify a select part of your subject to permit precise focusing.* I also have a Sony \"\"bridge\"\" camera that has both an electronic viewfinder and a rear screen. Many of the reviews for that camera criticize the fact that it requires a manual switch to go from using one viewfinder to the other (it doesn't sense your eye to switch automatically). I totally disagree, I much prefer to choose which viewfinder manually. One reason is I don't want my entire face lit up by the bright rear screen when I am taking candid photos in a darkened area.  To set it to one or the other you must dive deep into the menu to choose one viewfinder or the other. The eye sensor is also too sensitive ... I can be using the rear screen to compose a shot and if I move my hand to use one of the rear buttons the sensor thinks that's my eyeball and shuts off the rear screen. That can be very annoying when it happens just as I am about to capture an image.Final score about 4.75 stars.  Since Amazon doesn't permit fractional ratings the A7 will be rounded up to 5 stars.  There really are no compelling negatives to not consider this camera once you are really fully aware of what it does, and what it doesn't do.  And that has to be a decision that you alone make, not based on brand-name fans or anyone else's reviews.\"", "There are number of good reviews already shared by Amazon customers on this product, I will try to keep this review as non-redundant as possible while still trying to share my experiences.  To give you a background, I am not a professional photographer by any means but I do have passion for photography & love reviewing new gadgets.Over the years, I have come across several sub-compact point & shoot also some high-end digital SLRs from Canon, Fujifilm & Sony as I have access to them via Amazon for `production build' reviewing purposes and have shared my thoughts with Amazon community with several unbiased reviews in the past after thoroughly testing them from an engineer's point of view.Having said, here is the review for Sony &#945;7K, It is going to be a long review. Feel free to comment & explore any sub-topics you desire or read my overall impression in the end of this Sony &#945;7K review.Look & feel - Comfortably solid! - 4 stars!---------------------------------Sony has this camera body with `retro' looking edges. At first you feel the look is from the past by-gone era but honestly, the design grows onto you pretty fast with easy to learn intuitive menu system & placement of buttons. I had no problems in getting used to the camera. The customizable buttons feature makes it even better if you do not like a function assigned to a specific dial. Sony has done a tremendous work with the shape & size of this camera. This camera is way less bulky than most DSLR's that I have owned in the past. Sony &#945;7K feels very comfortable in hand. The grip is sure; comfortably solid, the body is magnesium alloy with dust and moisture sealing giving you peace of mind - one could not ask for more!Electronic View Finder & Articulated 3-inch display - Very useful! - 4  stars!-------------------------------------------------------------------I love both these features, while I prefer optical View finder (Too much to ask for this price range) this EVF is pretty darn good on this camera. It is 'XGA' quality presented using OLED with 2.4m-dot precision and 0.71 x magnifications. The clarity on this 'EVF' is superb and is found more or less centrally located on the camera body. Also, by using the 'EVF' the camera is close to your body and at eye level facilitates very stable shake free shots. The 'EVF' does allow you to get excellent quality preview of the exposure but tends to become little bit grainy in extreme low lit conditions but still usable. Having said, if you do not like 'EVFs' then there is an articulated 3-inch display with 921k-dot pixel resolution which can be tilted so that you can compose shots with camera raised up or below waist level effortlessly. BTW, this is not a touch screen display but the menu buttons icons make you want to touch them as the display is that brilliant. Shooting video is a pleasure using this excellent LCD display.Full HD 1080p Video Recording - Excellent quality! - Full 5 stars!---------------------------------------------------The Sony &#945; 7K features full 1080p video recording either at 1920 x 1080 (60p, 60i, 24p), 1440 x 1080 (30p), 640 x 480 (30p) both in MP4 & AVCHD formats; the included microphone is stereo but also allows for headphone & microphone jacks for even better input or monitoring. Video quality is pristine and allows full manual controls while shooting video. The video quality is top-notch making it very compelling to use instead of an additional bulky camcorder. You definitely can create professional quality video using this camera with minimal effort.Sensor & Auto-focus - Slightly faster AF than aSony &#945;7R- 3 stars!-------------------------------------------------------Sony &#945;7K Full-Frame 24.3 MP Interchangeable Digital Lens Camera with 28-70mm kit lens supplied uses a `Hybrid auto-focus' system using on-chip Phase detection & low-pass filter making this camera little bit faster in real-life auto-focus tests when compared with the 36.3 megapixel big brotherSony &#945;7R. While the more expensiveSony &#945;7Ris geared towards professionals who would benefit from the large 36.3 megapixel sensor for incredible details. This 24.3MP sensor is perfect for an individual who likes to take casual footage under well lit conditions or one who can accept reasonable response time needed from the auto-focus system to capture those precious moments in full-frame digital glory. In this case 24.3 MP is still pretty incredible detail for such footage's and is whole lot cheaper to own than aSony &#945;7R. This camera Sony &#945;7K was not designed for capturing sports footage or fast moving objects as Auto-focus still is slow at best especially in 'low-light' conditions.Shutter noise - Subjectively quieter! - 3 stars!--------------------------------------The Sony &#945;7 with the included kit lens actually sounds more likeSony NEXseries which in my opinion is much quieter thanSony &#945;7R; this is primarily because this camera uses different exposure technique wherein the physical shutter is already open for live view and merely gates the sensor down electronically to start the exposure. In this method all you hear is single brief `click' of a single curtain sound. Sony &#945;7R also being a tad slower than Sony &#945;7K making the sound last longer which we perceive as louder in my opinion. Having said, it does not mean you can conspicuously take photos and hope that no one notices you - You will get noticed when you hear that satisfying clack that a Sony &#945;7K makes.Picture quality - Very good! - 4  stars!-----------------------------While most general users of this product will find picture quality incredibly outstanding in all respects especially in lower sensitivities with the included kit lens. Having said, the beauty of the image sensor can be put to better use by opting better lenses. For example: ASony SEL35F28Z Camera Lenswhich definitely will cost you more but will give you sharper images. Using the included kit lens, RAW files compares well with most other high end DSLRs like Nikon at same levels of sensitivities. The JPEG mode however has some undesired post processing especially with images with high ISOs. Most users probably will never notice it till you start zooming into pixel levels but worth mentioning it.Battery, USB cable & charger - Average - 3  stars!---------------------------------------Battery life is average at best. It does seem to eat batteries somewhat faster than most DSLRs I have owned. Also, the idea of charging battery internally in a high-end camera like this will make some camera enthusiasts unhappy including me. I wished Sony included a regular wall charger and an `extra battery' in the kit which accepts batteries directly for charging rather than having to plug your camera to charge the battery. Having said there is an upside to this, you can charge your camera anywhere there is `USB port `availability - granted it will take forever to charge with 500mA output available from your PC. The included 2.1A charger works well but cumbersome to use with the short cheap looking USB cable they provide in the kit.Flash - `No Flash' included in the kit - Zero stars!---------------------------------------This is by far the greatest oversight on Sony's part for not including a simple `basic camera flash' on the body of the camera. Granted the camera is very good to capture images in low light conditions it just does not make sense to provide a `hot-shoe' and not give you a basic flash in the kit for the price you pay. Having a built-in flash comes handy every so often. This is by far the greatest disappointment for me.Overall impression - Very good! - 3  stars!================================The base specification is impressive so are the features. Picture quality is really very good with rich details even when zoomed to max in post processing; I am not saying Sony &#945; 7 with the included kit lens is perfect but very close to perfect. The excellent grip and intuitive revised menu system facilitates taking good pictures with less learning curve. The availability of sophisticated third party lens adapters opens up whole lot of new possibilities to experiment with. If you opt for better lenses you can definitely make it a whole lot better camera. The ease of use especially noting the smaller and lighter compared to most other cameras of similar specifications makes up for the difference. This overall is a good product no doubt in that.Amazon does not allow me to rate 3  stars and just to be fair and generous I am rating this with 4 stars! Hope you agree. Feel free to comment, criticisms are welcome :-)", "As an enthusiast photographer, that I am,  I wanted to give a review from that perspective rather than a more technical perspective from , perhaps, a professional, which I am not capable of doing just yetUpon opening the box for the first time, I was immediately struck by the small form factor (and somewhat retro look - but just my opinion) and light-weight of the camera body.  Indeed, I wasn't sure, at first, there was my camera inside the Amazon box UPS handed to me upon delivery (and UPS will require your signature for this item.  Otherwise they are going to leave with nothing and come back another day).This camera body looks sharp.  It's not completely magnesium metal body like its A7R higher priced sibling, but, rather, a mixture of metal and better plastics.  But very hard to tell the difference.  Point being, no one's going to accuse you of having anything less than a fine well-built camera. It feels good in the hand.  A good grip for your right-hand.  It's built like a tank.  And it's weather sealed.All the buttons are where I want them to be.  Perhaps the shutter button could be a little farther forward but it should be just a matter of getting use to it.  The menu system is far easier to use and navigate than on my NEX6.  And the NFC between the camera and my Android phone (Galaxy S4) is fast and convenient.  The remote control function works very well.  Checking latency revealed a very, very slight hesitency.  But so minor.  You'll hardly notice it.  Just a nit-pick on my part (like the shutter button-certainly no game changers).I bought two lenses (there are only 5 of the FE lenses out as of this writing but Sony is releasing a total of 15 by 2015).  The 35mm (very light) and the 55mm somewhat heavier and built well.  I use the 35mm as a walk-around street lens because it compliments the light-weight and portability of the full-frame A7.  In fact, this is why I bought the A7 in the first place.  For street photography and scenics.  At first I thought it would be a good 'stealth' camera for the street, but I have come to realize that with todays digital age we're just fooling ourselves if we think they don't know what we're doing.  These two lenses, by the way, are Carl Zeiss and they have received some of the highest praise of any lenses on the market today.  (A word of note, Sony is coming out with a 70-200mm lens full-frame for this camera April 20 2014 here on Amazon, $1495.00).So yes, the lens are expensive.  But they are proving their worth.  But one of the great advantages of these Sony cameras are their absolute adaptability too legacy lenses given numerous availability of lens-mount adapters for Minolta, Leica, Hasselbad, and then, of course, there's Nikon and Canon, as well as some others.  So there is a way to get around the expense if you have legacy lenses laying around.  Or you can buy some great glass on ebay cheaply which I'm told can rival, in some cases, some of the great glass of today.Finally, another great accessory which I bought, is Sonys Battery Grip which allows the use of 2 batteries and has a great form factor for the camera giving it a great grip, especially for larger hands as I have.  Also I like the button placement.As you can see.  I can't say enough about this camera.  But it's totally worth it.  In fact it's a steal at this price for what it does as a full-frame camera.  With the 35mm lens (minus the battery grip), you can throw it in your shoulder bag or pocketbook, go about your day, and take stellar pictures.  You won't regret this purchase.If my review helped you in anyway, and I sincerely hope it did, please check yes in the comments section below.  Have a great day.  Richard", "The A7 is a tough camera to review these days as it's really the start of a new system, yet it's compatible with so many others.  In that vein I'll examine the camera and it's own ecosystem (itself a work in progress) as well as the immense possibilities the compatibility offers.  Ultimately, your mileage will very based on your uses.I was surprised to see a not too bloated box, as some Nikon kits are much bigger, and while the camera and to a lesser extent the lens is smaller than a full frame SLR, the relatively compact package was a plus.  The camera itself makes a great impression, and while I read the A7R adds a bit more to the build, this body holds it own.  It's also compact in absolute terms and positively so in full frame terms.  Sadly the camera foregoes a built in flash.  That's disappointing, though not entirely uncommon (unfortunately) in full frame bodies.  My initial fears of the angular body impeding comfort were unfounded, and while my large hands prefer a larger grip (available but not yet evaluated), it's not much worse than a SLR without a grip added.  Ergonomics are good, though different than what I'm used to from my D90 and X-E2 (no surprise).Sadly, the grip brings up one of the challenges to this system: everything is so gosh darn expensive.  The body and kit are relative steals, which is great, but everything else (fortunately Sony abandoned proprietary memory formats years ago) is high, even compared to what I'm used to from Nikon.  The only flash costs a ton (it seems well equipped, but even then $100 overpriced), lenses are limited, but like earlier systems they are pricey compared with other first party offerings, and even a battery charger is extra.  In short, the camera itself is a great value, but if a complete setup is in the cards, do yourself a favor and price the full setup.In regards to using the camera, the menus again are different than what I'm used to, but honestly none of the major systems have usability down, but all are serviceable.  I never was happy with JPG output, despite trying a few things in the settings.  I did enjoy the large EVF, and the oled's quality and refresh rate allow me to avoid yearning for a true SLR.  The eye sensor however was a disappointment.  It was too eager to switch on and off, and it may in part contribute to the meager battery life.  In use the poor battery life (especially in light of not having a flash) joined the poor (and odd) auto ISO behavior.  Granted auto-ISO is a luxury coming from film, but it's a staple and powerful tool in digital, and the tendency to stick to 1/60 without the ability change the shutter setting.  The WiFi capabilities seem stout for studio shooters, but it lacks the ability to leverage a smartphones GPS.  I didn't use the apps, which appear limited.All in all most of the above pales in comparison with what this camera excels at.  It takes damn good pictures.  As noted before I wasn't thrilled with the JPGs, but I love what I get with RAW.  High ISO is amazing, detail is great, and the 24MP sensor doesn't overwhelm glass the way 36MP can (it can however challenge most lenses).  The included lens delivers good results stopped down, but the lens begs for a slightly better option.  For now the native solutions are limited and pricey.  I've yet to try the Zeiss options, but they get favorable reviews (as they should for the price).  In the longer term the first party lineup will expand, but I wonder what 3rd party options will exist.  Sadly there is no other full frame mirrorless (excluding Leica), so manufacturers will need to design primarily for this mount.  Granted full frame SLR lenses may be modified, but they will be bigger and not benefit from the inherent advantages of a lens designed for a short flange distance.Adapters open up a whole new world, and frankly this camera is the universal lens recipient.  It can take virtually any lens.  ANY LENS!  It can AF (and auto aperture) with any Sony, Minolta, and many Canon autofocus lenses.  That's A mount, E mount, FE mount, and EF mount.  Wowzers!  As with most mirrorless bodies, you can forgo autofocus and aperture and mount many more lenses, so that opens up the rest of the lenses out there.  The fact that full frame lenses keep their relative focal lengths is a huge plus, and lenses designed for cropped sensors still benefit from a 10MP cropped mode (which you can override--another plus).  The manual focus assists, including one of the better peeking implementations make manually focusing possible, even for those who never had to do that before.  I tried out a Nikon G adapter and 50mm and 85mm primes.  Ultimately I see this as a nice to have feature and a bridge to a better native lens lineup, but many users may see this as a powerful core feature or something they never use.If Sony can deliver a solid lens lineup, cheaper accessory options, and enhance the firmware a bit (especially auto ISO), this is a 5 star camera.  Likewise, if you're looking for a full frame camera to use great MF lenses on, this is a 5 star camera.  For now, I'd say it's a 4 star camera at its core, and one of the most impressive cameras I've ever used.", "Unfortunately, my Sony a7K arrived with a defective lens.  I am not sure exactly what is wrong, but the auto focus will not work.  When shaken very gently, I can hear something rattling around inside then lens.I received this Sony a7K through the Amazon Vine review program.  As such, I cannot use the typical Amazon return process to exchange it for a new camera.  I am also required to write a review within a certain period of time, which is the reason I am writing this now.  I am currently dealing with Sony's warranty department to facilitate a repair or replacement of the lens.  For now, as to not negatively scew the reviews, I will give it a 4 star rating.  The 1 star is being removed for quality control issues.  (In all fairness, the outer packing box looked like it had been through a war, so it might have been damaged by the carrier.)  When I receive the lens and have a chance to properly try out the camera, I will update this review.", "Okay, if you are into photography, but want more than point-and-shoot, or step to full-frame digital, Sony's A7 and A7R should be something to consider. I am not a professional, but have used many professional setups as an amateur. I believe the technology has caught up with simple to use, and yet elegant gear. Although not expensive, it's certainly not cheap. This camera is solidity built as many models costing 3, 4, or up to 10 times as much.  It's only down-fall, if any, is its size for those who have big hands or who want the big feeling bulk of DSLR camera gear.  I am impressed with the amount of manual to fully automated ways to use it while acknowledging quality along the way.", "After about 6 months of research and waiting, I got my a7, knowing that it is not a perfect camera, but that it is exactly what wanted. There are a ton of reviews of this camera out there telling you the pro's and con's and its features, you can read about them or watch a ton of video reviews, there is no lack of information about this camera on the internet, especially after it was named camera of the year by pop-photo magazine. So to variate from a typical review, I will give you a different perspective from a camera junkie who loves photography and has been doing it for a long time...This camera is targeted to the semi-pro or high end consumer who wants great quality pictures in a small package (you know that already) what I'll tell you is that, as that semi-pro, I'm surprised and very pleased with my new a7. I've been shooting it for about 15 days now, I have the Zeiss 55mm f1.8 and the 24-70mm f4. The zoom lens is great (though it's gotten some bad reviews), but I really like the 55mm F1.8, which couples great with the full-frame sensor on this beast. But since this review is for the a7, I'll focus on the camera it self:In my opinion, the camera really delivers in the Image Quality department, IQ is truly awesome and distinctive, specially if you compare it to other mirror-less cameras. No doubt the best IQ for any mirror-less camera option up-to-date (APR-2014), I had a Canon 5D mk3, (which I eventually got rid of due to its size and weight) and the pictures from this a7 are just as good as the 5Dmk3, in my opinion (without getting into technical details); however, its performance is not up-to-par with a pro-level-full-frame DSLR. This camera has some really cool features, but there are some annoying things that could be improved, like way the camera does auto ISO, the way apps work, and the (sometimes sluggish) focus system. Yet these are things that you can easily overcome by learning how to use the camera and tweaking it your way. Which brings me to another point: this camera is HIGHLY customizable, unlike previous versions of the NEX. Like any DSLR, you have to learn how to use this before you can start to get great shots consistently.The reason why I could not give it 5 stars is because I do not think its performance is optimized. By performance I mean the focus system, the battery life, the time it takes to turn it on, the slow FPS rate, the lack of stabilization-system (in-camera), and the AutoISO. But again, these are things that you can easily overcome.There is a large selection of compact mirror-less options out there, what makes this camera stand out is the large full-frame sensor, which produces some really special shots, better than any other mirror-less option out there. I also have an OMD EM5, which I love, and enjoy much. But it does not produce the quality images that I get from this a7. They are two different cameras, that in my opinion complement each other. Keeping in mind that the Sony FE system is still relatively new, the lens selection will hopefully grow for native mount full frame lenses, but having the option to adapt lenses from other systems and use the focus peaking system, makes this camera a ready-to-go option as well.The camera is easy to use, having had NEX cameras in the past, I feel that this menu system is an improvement, though there is still the need to dig around to find what you want. With the difference that you can customize the a7 to have all the features you use and need assigned to any button you want! Overall the camera feels rugged, solid/sturdy, not too heavy, not too light, VERY portable for a full frame with this type of IQ, and it is a total pleasure to use with just about any lens.There are complaints about the quality of the JPEGs, and clunkyness of the shutter vibration, which may cause camera-shake in long exposures. I recently updated the firmware, which is supposed to improve the IQ of JPEGs, and I really find the quality of my pictures (JPEGs and RAW) very nice, which is the main reason why I got this. Though I have to admit that for my special shots I only shoot RAW, then I work in post production using Lightroom 5, which has worked very well.As far as video, I don't use it often. Yesterday I went to a botanical garden and shot some video of flying butterflies, and I found the video quality of the MP4s in HD pretty decent, the camera does a great job focusing while panning and following moving objects. Again, I do not use the video much, and I'm not a video expert, but it does a decent job for what I've seen so far.Overall this is great buy, for $1600+ (at the time of this writing) it is the lowest priced high-end camera with a full-frame sensor, not to mention all of the features it has and the weather sealing... That's GREAT value! I think Sony will work out the kinks of the shutter noise and other performance issues in a later version of the camera, and me being the camera-junkie that I am, will probably upgrade when that comes out. That is not to say that I would upgrade right away. This is a very capable camera, that is a pleasure to use, and it produces pro-level images. In the end, as much as you love new technology and fancy features, good pictures are NOT taken by a good camera, they're taken by a good photographer! Which is why I really value how the camera feels when I am using it, the more comfortable you are with the camera, the better your pictures will likely be. I know you are reading this as part of your research to help you make a decision, so what I say to you is that: Understand that this is NOT a perfect camera, and that there are some things that a DSLR will do better, but if you want to have a very portable camera, capable of producing pro-level, high quality shots, with a few shortcomings, at a relatively affordable price for a full-frame, then this is your best bet right now. But if you don't mind carrying around a bigger camera, bigger lenses, and you have more money to spare, then there are better choices for you. I hope this helped you get closer to making a decision... Happy Shooting  ;)UPDATE (for HDR lovers):I've had the camera for almost a month now, recently took it to a trip in which I had a long lay-over in Paris, so I decided to go sight-seeing and took bracketed shots of the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and other monuments. Then I put the shots together using HDR software. The results are absolutely stunning! this camera is spectacular for those who love to do HDR photographs. Let me be clear though: Not the HDR pictures that come out straight from the camera, but rather taking bracketed shots at different exposure levels then using HDR Efx pro or other software. The reason why this camera is so good for HDR is because of the different bracketing options, and the amazing dynamic range in each shot, even in low light and hand held (using the 24-70 that has OSS) I got surprising results that I have not had with my beloved OMD- EM5. I am really pleased with this camera.", "On paper, I thought this would be the holy grail of cameras for me. In the end, it&#8217;s still a truly great camera, just not quite as perfect as I hoped.I&#8217;ve owned way, way too many cameras over the years across multiple formats and brands. Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, Sony, Nikon, Canon, Pentax&#8230;it&#8217;s quite ridiculous. In my defense I always used the cameras for months and not just for a few weeks.That said, my two favorite cameras in terms of image quality and ease of use were the Olympus E-M5 and Nikon D600. For comparison purposes, I&#8217;ll just focus on the D600 and keep in mind this isn&#8217;t a comprehensive list, just things that make the biggest difference to me (and maybe you).Advantages the D600 over the A7:- Much faster focusing, especially in low light- Better flash metering- Better out of camera JPEGs (this is subjective, I&#8217;m simply stating I like the colors and rendering for my tastes)- Better low light performanceAdvantages of the A7 over the D600&#8221;- Much smaller and lighter- EVF (I do prefer a high quality EVF over OVF, again personal bias)- Amazing video- Slightly sharper imagesIn the end I sold the D600 and kept the A7. The small size for a full frame camera is truly a breakthrough. It&#8217;s small when I want to carry a camera all the time and I can also add the optional battery grip for times I want to use it in the studio for better ergonomics and a more &#8220;pro&#8221; look (I know it&#8217;s silly, but people&#8217;s perceptions still matter sometimes).I own the FE 35mm and 55mm Zeiss lenses and both are awesome. I tried out the 28-75mm lens that came with the camera, but sold it. I was thinking of picking up the upcoming 24-70 f/4 Zeiss lens, but for the price, I decided to pick up the Sony RX10 which has a smaller sensor (but still relatively large 1&#8221; size) and a very cool 24-200mm f/2.8 lens. They are only $100 apart in price. I&#8217;ll save this for the RX10 review, but it&#8217;s an amazing camera and make a nice mate to the A7 with the primes."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.4401519000530243, 0.4460635185241699, 0.0004883923102170229, 0.0785127580165863, 0.0001247396576218307, 0.00012589918333105743, 0.004911478608846664, 0.005957359913736582, 0.0001561230019433424, 0.00949479267001152, 0.011480389162898064, 0.00012931767560075969, 0.0016705532325431705, 0.0006123387138359249, 0.00012038925342494622]]}
