"], "reviews": ["This is by far my favorite Fekkai product. I received it as a Prime member. I have also long been a loyal customer of Fekkai's products.This product keeps my hair looking in place, glossy (healthy) and styled without any greasiness or heaviness. The most amazing part of it is that my hair could look the same for another day or even two!It is like a leave-in conditioner with a light-weight styling effect in it. It works very well with my hair. My hair is fine and straight and in small volume. I rub very little into my hand and comb it through the bottom part my hair after blowdrying and sometimes curling, and then it just stays the way I like it to be for another day and even two, depending on the weather. It also makes my hair look radiant and healthy. It does not look shiny like oily or stiff. I am sure that if there is too much of the product or the product is rubbed onto the wrong part of the hair, near the root, it could weigh down the hair and have the opposite effect.The cream has a beautiful, elegant and light floral scent, which I love. I can't say enough good things about it!", "I have a lot of shoulder length hair but it's extremely fine and very prone to frizz. A dime size amount ( ok on a really bad day 2 dimes) rubbed into the worst offending strands smooths everything out magically. But I don't get any shine and that's really the products main stated purpose. Also it makes my hair a bit piecey , so unless I start going frizzy I don't immediately grab this. So while it's about the best de-frizzer I have ever used, for me there was no brilliance and my hair can edge a bit toward oily so I would have thought shine wouldn't have been a problem.", "This product has a nice smell to it, almost reminds me of an oceany, beach scent. I also like how after applying it, it made my hair feel weightless, very light. It doesn't really add a conditioning softness to my hair, but there is a slight glossy look. All in all, it does feel nice in my hair and leaves a faint, but pleasnt scent. After using my straightener, it looked a bit more smooth and shiny too. Not quite as &#34;glossy&#34; as I imagined, but it is nice.", "If you like the luster that a good hair oil can bring to your locks, but still aren't crazy about an oil's slick texture, Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is an ideal solution.Just a little bit of this nice, lightweight cream, melts into the air and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy thanks to its olive oil formula and its smells really nice, too, with a pleasant floral scent that isn't too perfume-y.And although it's on the pricier side, the 4-oz container lasts a long time, since just a small amount goes a very long way--resist the temptation to squeeze out as much as you'd normally use with cheaper stuff or it will leave your hair looking greasy.", "My hair is untamable... seriously, it's a mass riot of waves, straight and greys that ever existed together on a scalp. I hate my hair so much, so many times. Right now it is long because I've got no idea what to do with it. When I actually take the time to put some wave into it, I want it sleek on top where the greys tend to ping and stand out because of it. With the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme, I can actually get everything to lay in the layers that I have. Also, my hair looks shiny without looking oily. A huge difference that many creams, gels and glossing products do not do. There is no heaviness when I use this creme either, and I can rub it into my hands and face for some moisturizing benefit. The olive oil base is nice, and while it doesn't have a lovely scent, it's not an unpleasing scent. It's mostly without one actually.If Fekkai products were not so expensive, I'd give them five stars, but they are a bit costly. However, we do find occasional good deals at Walgreens. So maybe keep an eye out for them there.", "I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair.  It's not smooth and shiny.  It has a bit of curl and some days frizz.  I know the name Frederick Fekkai and his fame for hair products so I thought that this could be what the answers to my prayers.It wasn't.  I've used this product now for about a month and I haven't noticed any more shine than normal and my hair can still be frizzy and times.  It does smell good, and it goes on weightless and doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy or that feeling you get when there is too much product in your hair.  All of that is well and good, but it doesn't really do what I bought it for.  And at a list price of 19.99 it better do at least some of what it promises.  Unfortunately that was not my experience.  I'll be using what I have left, but I won't be ordering this again.  I've had better luck with Aveda products, and I recently saw that a competitor will be carrying Carol's Daughter products in it's stores, so I may try that instead.", "I generally love Fekkai shampoos and hair-care products, and this one is no exception. A really small amount goes a long way to giving my hair a less frizzy and coarse look, imparting shine and, well, slickness. The fragrance is pleasant but light, and so long as you don't use much, it's not greasy or heavy. Definitely worth a try, especially if you have thick, dull hair.", "infused with olive oil, smells like flowery things, polishes your hairs, boring hair is now exciting to others, a little goes a long way..a lot doesnt make the little long way any better.I have used so many glossing cremes, I should be freaking shiny all the time. I am not.This one , smells really good, and does leave my hair feeling....a bit conditioned-ish..but it did not make it shine like the top of the chrysler building.", "For context, I have blonde hair that is slightly longer than shoulder length and thick and slightly coarse in texture.  My hair is color treated and heat styled regularly so it tend to take quite a beating.  I've been applying this to my damp hair before blowdrying and flat ironing.  When using this in combination withFekkai Prx Oil 1.6 Fl Ozmy hair definitely looks healthier and less damaged than when I blow-dry and flat iron without any product.  That said, I think the claim of 'transforming' my hair is probably a bit of a stretch because while this does help my hair stay healthy, it is hardly a miracle product.  At the end of the day, my hair is still on the dryer, coarser end of things, even if it does look healthier.  With any of these products I think it is about going in with the right expectations.I did like this product, though for my purposes I'll likely stick with my existing styling product Davines This is a Moisturizing Fluid over this product because it does all the things this Fekkai product does and also seems to help my hair get straighter with blow drying alone so I have to flat iron less.  If this Fekkai product did that as well, I'd be sold.Overall I think this is a solid cream for the price, but not a miracle product.", "Fekkai is a great brand and I love trying their products. I love their PRX Reparative oil and this product is pretty good too. It  adds a silky texture to hair and make hair shinier. It doesn't really condition like an oil but it does seem to add more shine and strength to my fine hair. I gave this product four stars because I have used shine products that also add a little conditioning and while this makes hair silky it doesn't add a lot to my dry ends and there are products for the same price that add more conditioning. This is pretty much a high gloss formula to make hair shine, but for that, it works great.", "When Oprah first introduced me to Fekkai either through her O Magazine or her most wonderful things episode I was curious to try out the shampoo and conditioner. I finally found it on sale somewhere and quite honestly didn't feel it lived up to her hype. Thought I'd try the glossing creme since I'm a hair product junkie.Here are the claims, as listed on Amazon, that the product makes:Infused with Olive Oil.Scented by a fresh floral garden.Lightweight creme polishes hair with luxuriantly lustrous radiance.Dull frizzy hair is nurtured to shine and smoothness.Tip from the Fekkai Salon: A little goes a long way with this lightweight, leave in styler. Use sparingly.Transform hair's texture so it can truly shine. This lightweight creme with the brilliance of an oil lavishes hair with rich radiance  to leave it smooth and glowing with vibrant shine.Used at the legendary Fekkai Salons.First let me reiterate that a little goes a long way. The first day I used this I used about a hefty quarter size glob. I don't think my hair ever dried that day. From then on I experimented with the amount and finally for my hair length (shoulder) settled on a dime size glob.I'm a big olive oil person. Eating and using as a skin oil and hair conditioner (even though it takes forever to wash it out) so the product says it has olive oil in it and this is a claim I can't prove of course, but I love the way it feels on my hands and in my hair as I'm applying it.The product does have a nice smell to it. I'm sensitive to shampoos and conditioners and other hair product smells and this is a nice one.My hair is not dull and frizzy to begin with, but it dryer especially in the winter. I did find that the glossing creme brought out the shine in it and helped it style more easily.Since I can't afford to have my hair done at a Fekkai salon, this is a good alternative when I want glossy and smooth looking hair. I love this product and it more than makes up for my disappointment in their shampoo and conditioner!", "Love it.  I'm a product junkie.  The smell on this stuff is fantastic, very lemon drops and sunshine.  The consistency is. Dry smooth and keeps fly a ways at bay and helps smooth hair before a blow dry.  I like to take a dime sized amount and rub it on my ends and low dry.  I get smooth silky gorgeous curled under ends.I have three favorite smoothing creams .......and this has been the first one I have grabbed for days.  The oil in the cream really adds to the smoothing and shine for your hair.  So many hair care products have oil or are some kind of oil based products because a little oil really helps out in the beauty world.", "I had heard great things about the Fekkai line of hair products and recalled trying a sample of the shampoo and conditioner which left my hair very soft and smooth.  With the very dry winter, the ends of my hair needed a boost most days and since using the Fekkai glossing creme I've noticed an improvement of the look of the ends.  I like using only a small amount on bottom half of my hair (not close to roots) since too much of any styling product tends to weigh down hair or make it look greasy.  I found this glossing creme to have a really lovely scent that isn't too overpowering and doesn't make hair feel sticky, just smooth and hydrated.", "It does work pretty well. It did give my hair a bit of a shine and it conditions well. Read the directions  before use though. If you use too much you will make your hair oily. But if you use just a touch you'll get some nice results.", "The first time I used this, I used too much -- even though I only used a tad. My hair is long, curly/wavy, color-treated for years, and definitely has a mind of it's own. My bathroom is awash with conditioners of every brand and formula, from the cheap to the way-too-pricey. Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is ultra-concentrated. Because of it, I had to wash my hair again the next day. The second day I used a much smaller amount and my hair dryed naturally. To my eye, it didn't seem to have additional shine and felt a bit coated to me. This far, I am not overwhelmed by the results with this product, but it did make my hair feel somewhat softer.", "I don't know what is going on when I see other people giving this creme less than 5 stars. I love this glossing creme and have found it to be wonderful for taming my wild and crazy hair, and adding tons of shine as well!I have fine, graying hair which I color treat, and I really am particular about my hair. Fekkai usually comes through with good products, especially for people ( sigh ... like me) who have troubles with frizzy hair as well. This product provides a smoothing quality which I find terrific.If you have marvelous, long, thick, silken tresses, hey!!! What are you reading this review for?Go become a hair model for Pete's sake!But if you have incredibly frustrating hair like mine, try this.Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is a good value price wise, and a very nice product.Thanks,jean", "I love the smell of Fekkai products.  I don't think I have ever purchased one that I did not absolutely love.  Glossing just doesn't seem to be for me.  While I found that this works for an excellent detangler and something that does seem to moisturize my hair, it did not provide any particular shine that I could tell.  Also, my hair is still a little frizzy.  Overall, it works really well as a leave in conditioner product, but I don't think my hair is any glossier.", "I have 3B type curly hair, and I'm always on the look-out for new leave-in conditioners. I usually use sprays but I decided to give a chance on this product. This is a good product, nice scent of olive oil and a bit of lemon (to my nose anyway). Even with my long hair, I only need a dime-quarter size amount for my roots. It does also seem to volumize my hair a bit when I blow-dry my hair. I can't say that I've noticed a difference in how shiny my hair is, or that my hair is less frizzy (it doesn't get too frizzy anyway). My hair doesn't feel greasy after using it, or tacky. I'd recommend this if you are looking for a new and better product, but if you're happy with a product you already have, I wouldn't recommend switching.", "Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme 4 OzCategory: Hair CareI've used Fekkai Glossing Creme for a couple of years and render it &#34;Perfect&#34; -- this is the first time I've used the Fekkai &#34;Brilliant&#34; Glossing Creme.Lightweight creme polishes hair with luxuriantly lustrous radiance.Dull frizzy hair is nurtured to shine and smoothness.Transform hair's texture so it can truly shine. This lightweight creme with the brilliance of an oil lavishes hair with rich radiance to leave it smooth and glowing with vibrant shine.Used at the legendary Fekkai Salons.Okay, I'll try it! *into My Shopping Cart it goes*Notes after using the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme leave in styler, infused with Olive oil, for a couple of weeks:I started with clean hair -- the usual shampooing and conditioning, towel dried and then combed through damp hair with wide toothed comb routine (cuz that's the way I roll :) ).  Directions on Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme - squeeze tube  - are pretty straight forward -- just remember, a little goes a very long way.  I used a pea-sized amount of the glossing creme on My waist-length, super thick, hair -- and that was plenty. Just squeeze a tiny bit of product into palm, rub hands together, massage through damp hair. No tacky or greasy feeling, or funky residue left on my hair.  The glossing creme hasa  light, floral scent that quickly disappeared. Easy!*gets out blow dryer and blow dries hair, using round brush, as usual*  Hair dried fast. Absolutely, No weighted down look. Hair is super soft, light weight, but not all that shiny -- at this point. Also, it appears that the usual brassiness, of my blonde hair, has been toned down, quite a bit. Using the curling irons and brushes really brought out a beautiful, glossy, shine. If You use heat rollers (which I, normally, don't) the shine will probably be there, as well.Perfect! Hair is extraordinarily Beautiful. *does a little Happy dance*Does the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Off to buy a few more tubes, as I don't want to ever run out! Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2014", "hair  length: below shoulderhi-lighted, baby fineI love the light fresh scent this glossing creme has, however, for my baby fine hair, if I am not careful with it, it tends to leave my hair a little oily and limp. I have to be very careful only to use a tiny drop and run it only through the very ends of my hair. I noticed that when I first applied it, my hair looked great - shiny and soft, but after going about my day, it becomes more limp and almost as if I haven't washed it. This is when I use too much and put it too close to the roots.I've tried it both on wet and dry hair. On damp hair, I blow it dry to a nice soft shine, and if I didn't use too much, it gives my hair that &#34;straight shiny look&#34; -- on dry hair, it smooths any fly-a-ways to create that same soft shiny look.I'd imagine this product, while great for winter dry hair, would be too heavy for me to use in the summer. I also imagine that this product would be fantastic on a woman with thicker drier hair, frizzy hair, hard to manage hair, etc.I am not sure if I would order this particular product again, but only because it's not quite right for my baby fine hair that can tend to go limp. However, I like the scent enough that I'd consider it, using just a teeny bit through the ends--mostly in the winter.", "This works well in wet hair to keep the frizz at bay when drying. I touch up my hair a bit after drying with a tad bit more.  it makes my hair look clean and in check easily.  There's no noticeable smell and it's not greasy or oily.  It just does what a glossing creme should do.  I have used this nonstop daily since I received it and it's not building up on my hair or scalp.  Fekkai has awesome products. They are a bit pricier than I normally pay...but you get what you pay for in this case. I've yet to try another glossing creme or serum that does what this does.  And this 4 oz bottle will last and last since you only need a tiny line of product to do your entire head of hair.  My hair is past my shoulders in length and is baby fine.  This gives me manageability and healthier looking hair.", "\"This product does a great job smoothing frizzy hair and adding a bit of shine, but silicone is one of the main ingredients so you'll want to use it sparingly.I love the scent - it smells \"\"green\"\", like fresh-cut grass.  My hair falls about 3\"\" past my shoulders and I find that slightly less than a pea-sized amount is more than enough product to get the job done.  First rub your hands together to emulsify the cr&egrave;me then work into WET hair from mid-shaft through to the ends.  I would not recommend applying to the root area as it can weigh the hair down.  Blow dry as usual.  It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and frizz-free, with a touch of shine.  You can also apply it when the hair is dry, though I find that it weighs my hair (which is on the \"\"fine\"\" textured side) down and leaves it too \"\"flat\"\" looking.Some things to keep in mind:*May not be suitable for very fine or thinning hair*Strong fragrance (I think it smells great, but you may not agree!)*Contains silicone which can coat the hair; some hair stylists recommend limiting or avoiding silicone-based hair care products*A little goes a long way!  Overuse can leave the hair flat or even greasy lookingBottom Line:  I don't generally like silicone-based hair products, but this smoothing cr&egrave;me is going to be a handy weapon to have in my hair care arsenal once the humid weather rolls around - it's effective at taming those annoying frizzies.\"", "I have short hair, but it has lots of body and is sometimes a bit uncooperative when it comes to styling.  This product is great in that it gives me a little more control without making it look like I slathered my head in product.  The smell is light and refreshing, not overpowering like some cremes, and it doesn't leave my hands feeling oily after using.", "This has lots of hard to pronounce ingredients and some easier to pronounce ingredients that the Goodguide says are of a medium level of concern (e.g., propylene glycol).  But it goes on your hair, not your skin, so you've got less exposure.  The Fekkai brand is owned by P&G; which supposedly does not do animal testing, but there is nothing on the label to indicate one way or the other whether this product is cruelty free.I have very long hair that gets dry and flies away in the winter, and this creme helps - just not all that much.  It doesn't leave a greasy feeling either, so I am guessing this would be nice for someone whose hair does not crackle in the winter air.  It doesn't really gloss, though.  The effect is soft and subtle, instead.Four stars for contributing to manageability, with probably no animal testing and mostly okay ingredients.", "My daughter Frankie loves it and says it makes her hair shiny and healthy looking while keeping it moisturized. She uses it everytime she blow dries her hair. She also feels it's better than Morrocan oil which is easy to over do, making the hair greasy. She puts it on dry.", "I have super curly hair and it always looks like I didn't brush it, even after I flat iron it, if the humidity is high or if it's raining.  Nothing has worked as well as the Fekkai glossing cream, I was shocked when I smoothed it on.  It made my hair as shiny and silky as the hair on Barbie dolls (before it gets all tangled and ugly and someone cuts it off, but only half-way).  It has a nice faint apple smell and doesn't weigh the hair down or make it look greasy.  I'm a huge fan of this stuff now and I never even heard of it a month ago.  If you have kinky/curly hair, curly/coarse hair, thick frizzy hair or just annoying hair that never looks like you brushed it, you'll flip over this.", "I have always liked Fekkai products and this glossing creme is right up there with some of my favorite Fekkai products.  Just a little bit goes a long way.  I put a pea size amount in my palm and rub it through the top layer of my heir.  It calms the frizzies and makes my hair shiny and soft.  This product is well worth the money.", "I've always wanted to try Fekkai products but haven't done so until now.To me the scent is not as they describe &#34;a fresh floral garden&#34;.  The scent to me is just ok, not bad or good.I have super thick hair, so since they state that a little goes a long way, to use sparingly, I first used like a dimes worth and ran it through my long hair, but avoiding my scalp.  It didn't seem to be quite enough, so I applied the same amount again, than ran a brush through my hair, which was wet at the time, having just shampooed it.  They say you can use it on dry or damp hair.It did leave my hair shiny, but so do most hair conditioners, stylers, so I can't say this is any better, but it definitely is also not worse than most hair products I have used, do use.I would say to only use a small amount, because this product does have olive oil in it, then apply more as needed.  It didn't leave my hair feeling greasy, which is good.", "\"I've been in the process of removing (black) hair color from my hair and going blonde, since my hair is coming in white anyway and has since I was in my 20's. It's time to put down the hair dye and embrace something lower-maintenance than dark hair that shows a line of demarcation 10 days after a color job. I don't have the patience to grow it all out and look like a skunk-head for a couple of years, so my hairdresser and I decided to employ the bleach. I always thought my hair could take anything, but bleach (even over six treatments) has turned my once-silky hair into something that I can only describe as harder than hell to just walk out of the house with. It takes TIME to deal with it now, because if I don't? I look like a scaggy streetwalker who uses peroxide.My old hair styling routine and products aren't working right now, when my damaged hair grows out I can go back to using them but right now I have dull, dry, and even straw-like hair in some areas. When the Fekkai glossing cream arrived I used it with the expectation that it wasn't going to make THIS dull dry hair glossy, because really not much is working on my hair right now. Some days I just have despair over it, but know that it's unavoidable for awhile.The first time I used way too much---I have long hair, so thought a quarter-sized amount would work. WAY too greasy. A nickel-sized dollop was about right though. I put this on damp hair, blowdried straight on low heat, and this stuff made my hair look like it did BEFORE I bleached it within an inch of its life!! The ends were silky (not shiny or glossy, but NOT DULL DRY AND CRISPY!) and held together instead of poking out like straw. The first 4\"\" of my hair where the bleach really made my hair look fuzzy, now lays flat and silky on my head. Now, my hair is not GLOSSY---I don't think at this point anything could turn this dessicated straw into GLOSSY. But it's smooth, silky, and FLOWS softly.  Holy everloving moly............I use this EVERY DAY now because without it, I can't hope for much. (Yes, S-Factor for flatironing works, but nothing else has made my hair SILKY).  I can go two days without washing after I flatiron, before it feels too 'greasy' in my scalp and I have to wash it. If your hair is not long and thick like mine, try a dime-sized amount and keep it away from your scalp, you can always use more but once you get too much you look like a dirty person who doesn't wash her hair. You don't want that.This stuff has changed my angst and despair over the condition of my hair, into loving my hair again. I know that my hair problems are only temporary (what, a year til the straw grows out?) but if this makes my FRIED hair look silky and flow like healthy hair, imagine what this looks like on GOOD hair. I can't wait!!\"", "Dear Reader,Every hair product I've used has a downside.The only downside to this product is the ingredient list of scary sounding chemicals.Not big on that. I may keep searching for a hair product that works as well without the chemicals.But,This is the best product I've found so far to keep my hair perfectly smooth, silky and non-frizzy!I am excited to report that this product has a great consistency that does not add weight to the hair.It does not make the hair appear as if there is product in it - looks natural.It is not sticky, but silky. It smells great - a light scent, thank goodness - not big on scents.There you have it, a very honest assessment.", "The label says use sparingly. I have fairly long hair (a few inches below my shoulders), fine and dry. I used about 1/4 to 1/3 tsp., put it in my palm, and then massaged it into my damp hair, concentrating on the ends. It's a good detangler, and has a light floral fragrance which dissipated quickly. But I try to buy products that say not tested on animals, and this does not say that.", "I have very dry hair, especially in the winter months so cremes and serums are always something I'm looking to try.  This creme was just okay.  It smells really nice but it made my hair greasy and even with that didn't control the fly-aways.  I like the Toni&Guy Smoothing Lotion much better and it's less expensive.
