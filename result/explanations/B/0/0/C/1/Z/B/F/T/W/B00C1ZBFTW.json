The opening setup bores enough to make me not care.", "This game was decent.  I'm not going to go into much detail about the game, but I do have a few things to say.  A pros and cons chart seems like the easiest way, so, here it is.Pros:- great graphics for the 3DS- monsters are cool- press turn battle system (hit a weakness and gain a turn, miss or hit a resistance and lose one)- soundtrack is awesome- can revive after losing battles, reducing frustration from having to constantly re-load- fusing demons is as fun and addicting as everCons:- dungeons are all pretty same-y.- battle system is easy to exploit, making battles repetitive and tedious- far too easy to get lost on the world mapOther (good/bad depending on person):- tons of grinding- difficult- very bare-bones story that exists only to send you out to fight more monstersBasically, the game is decent.  The simple story (search for somebody, and do quests for people you meet on the way) is enough to give you a reason to fight monsters, but nothing more.  Battles boil down to finding the enemies weakness and using that attack until you win; if you lose, grind a few more levels and try again.  If you're looking for a grind fest, or a game focused more on a traditional turn-based battle system, you might like this.  If you're looking to collect and fuse demons, or are a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games, you'll love this.  If you're looking for a story-driven game like JRPGs are often known for, avoid this.Personally, I found the pros and cons were decently balanced, but I had some fun with the game and don't regret playing it, so I give it 3 stars.", "Fans of other shin megami tensei games will be right at home with this game, although the difficulty early on and the length of time it takes to actual get the story going make it not so accessible to newcomers.", "I put 46 hours into this game, and plan on playing through it again. Its amazing, the perfect game for 3ds. A must buy for Shin Megami Tensei veterans and newcomers alike", "Good game, but definitely lacking compared to other SMT games.Don't let the slow start discourage you with this one...the story definitely picks up with time.", "I liked this game but I'll be darned if the introductory period was longer than it ever needed to be. Video games really need to stop spending 90 years explaining every fine detail of their game to me. Leave that to the manual or let me figure it out on my own.The story is good, the animation is pretty good for mobile, and just about everything else is up to the standard that you'd expect from an Atlus venture. If you are looking up this game you likely are the market that would like it, I don't see this being something people accidentally stumble upon.", "Just thought I would write a few words about this game because it is freaking awesome! I still ain't done with it, but I am having a blast! It's really addictive trying to fuse stronger demons! And the game is pretty challenging! The music is also really, really good. I'm not done with it yet, but I doubt that I will ever get tired of this game. And the 30 dollar eShop credit for buying this and Fire Emblem Awakening is just great.", "This is my first Shin Megami Tensei game, I was not so excited for this game and I just get this game for the digital promotion in Nintendo's Eshop, because i already had Fire Emblem Awaking and i enjoyed very much the game, so about Shin Megami Tensei 4, Like i said before I don't like this kind of games but the story are very interesting, the relationship between the demons that you summon and the other samurais are very interesting too, when you stat a battle you had 2 possibilities, fight or talk with the demons and try to it become your ally, the dialog between U and the daemons can be very randomly and it make interesting, some times the demons just get offend and attack you, or they ask u form money, objects or even part of your life to become your ally, overall the game is very addictive and interesting, it is a game to someone with a little patient and interest, not for kids or teenage, it is a great addition tho your 3ds games library", "Since the early days of gaming the 3D view for RPG's has been very popular. With titles such as Ultima, Bards Tale and Eye of the Beholder it was one of the most unique things about gaming at the time. Later on a company called Atlus developed a game called Shin Megami Tensei and it was a game that very unique. It allowed you to explore dungeons, recruit demons and fight through wonderful stories. Now Atlus has released it's latest sequel for the 3DS called Shin Megami Tensei IV but is this a dungeon crawl you'd like to experience?First this is a direct sequel to SMT: Nocturne (which was on the PS2) and has you as candidates from the gauntlet rite. You are Flynn and you are a samurai and you are charged with fighting the demons that plague Tokyo. As with previous games you can not only fight the demons but recruit them as well. You do this by negotiating with them and if you are successful they will be added to your party. Also you can use demon fusion to create new and more powerful demons which will be an aid later on in the game.The system is still a turn based system as you issue commands to the characters in your party. However, in this installment there has been one new upgrade called the press turn system. In this system if you find and exploit an enemy's weakness you are granted more attacks in battle. You are also given the opportunity to smirk which not only increases your damage output but also reduces your vulnerabilities.This is an exclusive for the 3DS and the graphics are quite amazing as you will go through various environments, battle demons and engage with unique characters. As with other SMT games there is also a route system broken into law, neutral and chaos and depending on which route you take affects the way the story unfolds.Shin Megami Tensei IV is a wonderful addition to the series and if you have a 3DS and you're a fan of the SMT games you need to rush out and pick this up. And if you have already purchased Fire Emblem and this game you can get a $30 Nintendo eshop credit!"], "Gamma": [0.032878465950489044, 0.035185556858778, 0.032825108617544174, 0.03467492386698723,
