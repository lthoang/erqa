I think the construction is solid enough to let one kid enjoy it throughout its entire life cycle, but I wouldn't be surprised if a family of kids could grow through it and it still keep 360ing.", "\"After seeing a neighbors kid having a blast with this our grandson was begging his mama for one, of course Grandma and Grandpa to the rescue. First of all it is very well made with a steel frame, shaft of the handle bars and the handle bars themselves are also are made of steel. The castor wheels are very strong rubber, just what you would expect and want the wheels to be. The castor cover are hard plastic, they act as a protective cover to avoid picking up dirt, rocks, water, and of course the odd sock (if using inside the house).The seat is plastic, hard but durable adding strength to keep it from becoming brittle.  On the handle bars, where little hands grip, there is very cushy soft dense foam type material.  This foam could be picked off by little fingers for sure.  The plate where little feet go has a very strong well attached good size sand paper like grip so their feet don't slip off, it really helps keep feet in place while doing all the turning of those front wheels and wiggling of the little bottom. The seat is adjustable back and forth for growth but not up and down, length of legs if the factor here so up and down is not needed.You can adjust for 2 - 3 lengths. The screws are standard so would not be hard to find replacements for if needed.It comes with a solid one year warranty and up to 2 years on certain parts you get a phone number to call and register the bike for the warranty.  When I call to register I plan on asking for a list of replacement parts and the availability to order them, especially the foamy hand grips.  I will come back and add what info I found out about those replacement parts and availability after I talk to the radio flyer people.It took my hubby and I 12 minutes to put it together, (yes we timed it) .  Now for the fun factor. Our Grandson loves to watch a show called \"\"The Wiggles\"\" and his mom and he do the wiggle, wiggle, wiggle stop -  song  he was \"\"helping\"\" us with the usual child anticipation----- \"\"hurry poppy\"\" (thank goodness it only took 12 minutes) he jumped on and immediately was off and running and started singing \"\"wiggle, wiggle,wiggle -go , over and over . He just loves this crazy thing and I wish I was young enough to try it out, would love to feel what it is he is feeling.If you are looking for a cool and different, built to last toy for a kiddo for Christmas or Birthday I would definitely recommend you check this out.\"", "\"I have always liked Radio Flyer products.  I have the wagon and a scooter and feel they are solid products.  So when I saw this new item, I wanted to give it a try.  My kids and I put it together on the carpet, so as not to scrape the painted metal pieces.  It all came very nicely wrapped and padded, so no issues there.It took about 15 minutes for us to get it all together and ready to ride.  The screws were not the easiest thing to do, funny angles and all, but it wasn't difficult or impossible by any means.  Our only issue is how the handle piece connects with the main frame.  Possibly we did it wrong, but it never did \"\"snap into place\"\" like the directions said it would. What resulted from that is that now the handle is loose and we can't seem to figure out how to tighten it.  I am going to take it apart and give it another go, but for now it's working fine with no complaints from my child.I wish this toy was somehow foldable, because space for kids toys is at a premium in my house.  For now this is staying in an outdoor shed and used outside.\"", "\"First: Contrary to popular belief, a 5 star rating does not indicate \"\"perfect\"\" in Amazon's system, but \"\"I love it\"\".  (4 stars = I like it FWIW)I have three kids, aged 3, 6 and 9, so I have a garage full of child sized vehicles - from scooters, to trikes, to big wheels, to regular bikes.  I also have three ride-ons that use the same action as this Radio Flyer.  Needless to say, I am VERY familiar with ride on toys...from researching and buying, to assembling and repairing.If you are in the market for a ride-on that uses \"\"plasma car\"\" action (back and forth motion to move the vehicle), this one is highly recommended, and a great value at current asking prices on Amazon.  Since I own what I guess are the three most well known ride-ons that use this action, I'll give you a quick comparison based on my experience:The original Plasma Car:  currently selling for about the same price as this Ziggle on Amazon.  While we owe this model our gratitude and respect for bringing the concept about (I think), it's been FAR surpassed by the other two I own, in just about every category except price (and only a few dollars difference from Ziggle at the time of this review).  PASS.  All plastic, LOUD, not smooth at all, and most importantly, it's very difficult to go fast so many kids end up just using their feet on the ground to self propel.  Cool shape?  Yes!  Great, original  idea?  Also yes!  But again, I would not recommend this to anyone with so many other better alternatives in the market.  Also, the travel of the front wheels is so restricted, relative to the other two below, that you have to \"\"twist\"\" twice as fast or more, to get up to the same speed (which in most cases is not even possible).EZY Roller:  This gets FULL 5 stars from 130+ Amazon reviewers for a reason:  it IS all that, and IMO, sits at the top of the plasma ride-on food chain.  This is the mack daddy, but also costs exactly twice as much as the Ziggle.  What that extra $$ gets you is:  more age flexibility (even adults can ride the EZY, with an included extension), a hand brake, a lower to the ground profile, and I think EVER SO SLIGHT of an edge in terms of speed (compared to the Ziggle).  Also HIGHLY recommended.  Get this if you plan to use with older kids, or on hills (since it has a lower center of gravity).Radio Flyer Ziggle:  The reason I am so impressed with this model, is that the build quality is SO good (as good or better than the EZY), yet costs half as much!  I watched my 6 YO test out the EZY and the Ziggle back to back, and finally asked her if she could only choose ONE, what would it be, she chose the Ziggle, I think because she liked the way it turned, and that she felt the handlebars gave her a little more control (EZY only has foot control).  Both of these will zoom though, so I would not even consider that in the equation.I guess my only concern is that they used foam (it is dense, but still) for the hand grips, and I can tell you from experience that that material will likely not last more than a season.  We will see though...maybe I'm wrong.Editing to add after many days of play:  Unless you have one kid, or one ride-on per kid, the seat adjustment on this is a big pain, with 4 bolts and nuts that need to be unscrewed and screwed again each time you adjust the seat.  There are plenty of better ways to do this (ask me how I know), so it's too bad they chose not to use a much faster release mechanism for the seat.  Since I have 3 multi-sized kids, and if I were Dad of the Year (I'm not, therefore I didn't), I would have to remove and re-attach the seat for each kid since they are such different sizes.  The middle kid and the fun-sized kid could probably share a setting, but it wouldn't be comfortable.I should also note that adjusting for length on the Ezy Roller is just as tedious (even more so, maybe, considering you have to use extension pieces that are separate).  Not a huge knock for either ride-on, just a wish list item for a Dad that is basically the riding toy mechanic for three kids, and the neighbor kids as well.So in summary, an easy 5 stars here (4.5 if I could), and kudos to Radio Flyer for putting out such a high quality toy at this price point!  We have a couple other of their outdoor wheeled vehicles (a wagon, and a trike), and this one by far has the best quality feel to it.\"", "Grandson is 5 and he had this put together, grandpa had to answer phone, and they only needed to put the screws in it. When all the screws were in it outside it went and he had the best time with it. We brought it back in the house when little brother, almost 2 yrs, got up from his nap and he showed little brother how to ride it--I was surpised he could in the house, kitchen mostly on linolemum. Not a large area really at all and he was riding it. Little one isn't interested even with sit adjusted for him.I can just imagine the kids riding it on a large concrete area and how fast they could go. This weekend we plan to see how it works at the basketball courts in the park. It's very constructed of course it's a Radio Flyer lol", "I think ever child had a toy made by Radio Flyer. Our daughter owns both a Radio Flyer Red Wagon and a Radio Flyer Tricycle - however her new favorite (by a mile) is the Ziggle.In some ways the Ziggle is like the popular Plasma Car... but with some significant improvements. The Ziggle is more of a full body-wiggling experience, and it has a more fluid motion. I also think that the Ziggle is a little bit more intuitive and can be ridden by younger children.Notes-- You may want to consider having you child wear a helmet, because if they want... they can pick up some speed.- Your child is propelled forward by twisting their arms and torso (or wiggling). It is kind of tough to explain, so you will want to watch the video.- The steering is pretty fluid, since all for wheels pivot independently.- The only brakes included are the bottoms of your child's feet.- The seat is adjustable so that the Ziggle can be used by children ages 2 to 10(ish).- Assembly is pretty easy and only takes a couple of minutes.- One thing is that since all four wheels independently pivot it makes it tough to push the Ziggle in a straight line. Not a big deal, until you try to push it into the garage for storage!Final Verdict - While it can be a little tough on the shoes (due to the lack of a brake) but the Radio Flyer Ziggle is a huge hit. Our 4 year old daughter loves riding it + all of the neighborhood kids flock to it!  The Ziggle could be the surprise hit of the 2013 Christmas Season!5 stars", "The Ziggle has been quite the hit with my daughter age five and half and my son that's nearly three years old. It has provided for hours of fun and our only real issue has been that for now they've had to share it. Who really wants to take turns when you are having such a blast coasting, wiggling, and Ziggling? It totally makes me happy that this is outdoor toy is not one that a child could easily become bored of.Assembling the Ziggle is pretty straightforward. The only tool you will need that isn't provided is a wrench. It only has 5 large pieces including the seat and 6 sets of screws and one tightener to hold on the handle bars. Instructions are straightforward and there were no issue assembling it. It only took about 10 minutes and  it could have gone quicker.I really like that this toy can work for a wide range of ages. Three to Eight is what's suggested and because you can easily adjust the seating is how that's possible. Though low to the ground, a child can pick up a good amount of speed, so I would suggest that when using this toy that kids would wear helmets to be completely safe. It seems completely durable and there's been no tipping when turning to make corners.Overall, I highly recommend the Ziggle because it's loved so much by my kids, the quality is quite impressive, it has long lasting appeal, and it's adjustable to your child as they grow.", "\"The Ziggle has no pedals and the rider rides it by turning -- \"\"wiggling\"\" -- the handle bar. It sits really low so my little ones reported that they felt rather uncomfortable in it, even though they are both the prefect physical size for this ride-on toy. The older kid can do spins, but he doesn't really enjoy doing so, and neither likes wiggling their way forward. The novelty factor, however, does help my kids find new friends in the neighborhood park, so in that aspect it's an interesting toy. In the end, I don't see the kids riding on this after a couple more months.\"", "First things first, this comes in pieces, so you will have to put this cool Radio Flyer Ziggle Ride on together.  It was, however, quite easy to piece together.  We found that our system squeaks.  I'm unsure if this is because of how we put it together or just how this is, but for us, this bike is a little loud.Our kid tester was a somewhat tiny 4 year old.  She enjoyed it, for the most part.  Our kid tester found learning to ride this a bit of a learning curve.  She picked it up in a good time, but it isn't something that she understood from the get go.  As far as riding, it's a smooth ride on level ground, but can get really fast when going downhill or really difficult on an incline.Overall, this is a good size 'unique' style riding toy that my kid tester really quite enjoys!", "Exceptionally easy to put together, the Ziggle took less than 10 minutes to assemble. We barely had the Ziggle put together and our newly 3 year old little boy was ready to hop on and start Ziggling. It was raining and getting dark outside but we put on the rain gear, flipped on the light and headed out anyway. Rain or shine Ziggle anytime! My son hopped right on and without any direction started moving all over the driveway.Some great things I noticed about the Ziggle: It is really safe. There is really no tip risk with this and we didn't even use a helmet as it is so low to the ground.It is really easy to use. We didn't have to show our toddler how to use it at all, it is intuitive. It is durable. Radio Flyer stands behind their products and makes everything with the utmost standards in quality.It is easy to store. It is lightweight and has a low profile. Very easy to store in the garage without taking up a lot of space.The seat is adjustable. As your child grows the Ziggle grows with them.Long lasting fun! This Ziggle will be a part of our outdoor activities for years to come as the kids grow.The price point is wonderful considering just how fantastic this product truly is. You will not be disappointed.", "This toy will grow with your child and get lots and lots of use.  My son who is a year and a half old had 7 of his cousins over that range in age from 1-13.  They ALL took a ride on the Radio Flyer Ziggle and loved it.  The little kids could just walk along with it or push it around and the big kids really got it moving.  Sure, the 13 year old was a little too big for it physically but who cares?  This is a wonderful outdoor toy that got all the kids active and laughing, which are my favorite two things!  I love that my son will play with this for a long time and it is worth the money we spent on it.", "\"We are graduating (finally at 9 & 10) from the Plasma Car that the kids LOVED THE WHEELS off!!  Now on to the ziggle car.Sadly they are going to be too tall before the fun of this great toy is used up.  Both kids are around 70 pounds - and around 4' 10\"\" and that is the absolute tallest this ziggle might be able to hold - depending on the leg to body ratio - but my son is about at the limit - keep that in mind - they do say this toy is for UP TO 8 year olds ;-)Okay, the kids helped put the ziggle together, so it took about 30 minutes.  My husband doing it by himself would have taken about 4 minutes.  lol - go figure!  But it was a great family project.  And then we had to watch the youtube videos to see how to spin out and half kill ourselves.  No sense trying to figure that out on our own when a legion of young teens have already done it, videotaped it and uploaded it.Back to the quality.  Real steel!  And GREAT rollerblade like wheels - covered by castors.  The seat is plastic but everything else is fairly substantial.  The handle bars are a nice thick foam.  I was pretty impressed by the quality of the ziggle.  I think Radio Flyer has been around for a million years - that was the brand of sled I had back when dinosaurs walked the earth ;-)I was a little worried at first because the actual box it arrived in is not that big - I figured it had to be much bigger - but they use the IKEA flat pack magic method of getting a  whole lotta crap into a little box.  All the pieces fit together perfectly which is really nice.Tonight the kids are ziggling around a flat parking lot.  And all the other kids are clamoring to use it - very popular toy.Tomorrow they want to ziggle down a very steep hill at the local park.  I am going to make them wear their helmets for that ride - there are no brakes as far as I can tell - I have 911 on speed dial and as for myself, I will have the pitcher of martinis thinly veiled in a sippy thermos as I watch.I think this is going to be a HUGE hit for the holidays.  I wish they had this when they were 3 & 4.Overall - great quality - great for the recommended age (keep height in mind) - easy to put together - we only needed to get one \"\"crescent\"\" wrench out of the toolbox - you probably have one of these wrenches, and it probably isn't even needed unless you know your kids will plan to get \"\"air\"\" on the ziggle.Any kid would be thrilled to find this on Christmas morning.\"", "My kids loved the Plasma Car.  Despite the Plasma Car being a neat concept, the design always seemed a bit cramped to me (though my kids never complained).  As they seemed to enjoy the Plasma Car, I thought they would love this.I have always loved Radio Flyer products.  I have a soft spot for a good quality metal toy.  As I took the Ziggle out of the box, for the most part I was not disappointed.  The Ziggle is mostly metal construction.  The only predominantly plastic parts on the product are the seat and the guards on the casters.The instructions suggest having an adjustable crescent wrench for assembly.  I grabbed my socket set and that worked fine.  If you have a vice grips handy, that would work fine too.  Assembly of the Ziggle was quite easy.  There are two hex wrenches in the box that are required for installation.  Once I got the tools together, assembly was just under 20 minutes.  The resulting product seemed sturdy with smooth movement.  At 245 pounds, I was well beyond the maximum 80 pound weight limit so I gave it to my three children (10, 7, and 6) to play with and test.My children were quite thrilled with the product and they quickly started racing each other in the garage, the Ziggle versus the Plasma Car.  After roughly a week of use, I noticed that the Ziggle developed a bit of a squeak when they moved the handle bars.  I have not taken the time to attack the toy with a can of WD-40.  The squeak very well could go away with a little oil.  I asked the kids for their opinions on the Ziggle and this is what they told me:7 year old:  Rated the product 4.5 stars.  They loved the fact that the product had a natural feeling foot rest compared to the plasma car and there was no need to put their feet on the ground.  They mentioned that they liked how easy it was to control with the larger steering wheel.  To the 8 year old, the drawback was that you cannot move backward with the Ziggle, even if you put your feet on the ground and push.6 year old:  Rated the product 5 stars.  They told me that they loved how the car moves with just their arms and that there was no need to use their feet (I had never noticed them using their feet with the Plasma car, but two of my three children found this important enough to tell me, so I am mentioning it in the review).  They also said they liked how smooth the Ziggle was to ride.  Like my 7 year old, they did not like the fact it was next to impossible to move the Ziggle backward without getting up and lifting the toy.10 year old:  Rated the product 4 stars.  The biggest complaint from my 10 year old was that the toy did not fit her well (she is about 20 pounds past the maximum weight limit, so this is not a surprise).  They said they liked the fact it was a good arm workout and the toy goes pretty fast.  They were a bit disappointed that the toy started squeaking.  The biggest drawback to my 10 year old was again the fact the car cannot be moved backward without lifting the vehicle.Overall, my impressions of the Ziggle are very positive.  The children have been having fun with it and it does not seem to be quite as cramped as the Plasma Car.  While I have not tried either product personally, the larger steering wheel on the Ziggle appears to be more natural to operate and the larger diameter gives the rider a bit more leverage to operate the vehicle easier.  I give the Ziggle 5 stars despite the squeak.  Based on watching my kids, I am sure the Ziggle would support weights greater than 80 pounds, but with children bigger than that, it does not seem to fit them well.  I would defiantly recommend the Ziggle!", "My son loves this!  He glides down the driveway like nobody's business and doesn't have to worry about reaching the pedals. This is a fun toy for him that gets him out of the house and helps him gets some sunshine and fresh air. This Radio Flyer provides hours of fun and exercise for my little boy. We love this!", "This was an instant hit with our nephew. He is a preschooler and once he figured out how to ride it, it grabbed his attention for several weeks. He still loves riding it.The concept is similar to the Plasma Car and the kids have tried those too. The difference is that Plasma Cars are made from plastic while this bike is metal. So if weight is a concern for you, I would not recommend this.Now we have several other Radio Flyer bikes and wagons. As with other products, this lives up to the Radio Flyer name for quality and durability. This looks very durable and made from high-quality materials.", "As a parent I'm a huge fan of this rider. Like most things Radio Flyer it was relatively easy to put together and is made of durable materials.Most importantly the Ziggle Ride On is Self-propelled... Which is awesome because it's not Dad-propelled like that wagon we have out back.  My kids are getting too big to pull around, it's time they start making their own way in the world and this is the perfect tool.In all seriousness I love that my kids have to move their arms and legs to get this thing jetting forward and so they are getting a little exercise every time they use it. It's tons of fun and now I find myself a little jealous that I'm too big to ride it. I have a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old and the only problem we've come accross with the Ziggle Ride On is that we only have one of them and my kids want to argue over who gets to ride it.", "Lot's of fun for the kiddos.  Putting together out of the box was not hard.  Only takes a few minutes to put together.  Both my boys 5 and 7 can ride this thing without problem and has a lot of fun doing it.  I wish it were able to carry more weight and bigger kids just so that we could use it longer.  The kids do like that it is pretty fast and maneuverable.  Much quicker and has faster controls than the other wiggle vehicles we have.  Fun ride.  Decent price.  I would recommend getting it for younger kids so they can grow with it and not out of it.", "My grandson is mad at me. I made him go home with his mother but leave his Ziggle here. He was outside up and down the driveway until it was dark and the porch light didn't light up the yard enough. I think he would have stayed on the toy all night.Easier to assemble than I expected. He is a big almost 6 year old and it fits him perfectly with room to grow. Sturdy enough that when he gets too big for it it will still be around for his little brother and cousin. It was fun to watch him have so much fun.If you are looking for a Christmas gift for kids ages 3-8 this would be fantastic, but be ready to shovel snow out of the way they will want to get right outside and play with this and then all their friends will want one too!!!", "The almost-6-year-old boy loves this. He wanted, at first, to just push with his feet on the ground, but once he tried moving via wiggling, he was hooked. We've had no issues on asphalt and brick surfaces. I do recommend a helmet if your child is likely to get going fast, you can unbalance yourself and tip over.", "I highly recommend this ride on as my six year old has a blast on it.  It was easy to put together and seems quite durable.  We have the plasma car and fun as that ride on is all you do is turn the handle to get it moving.  This ride on requires your child to not only turn the handle but also move their feet as well to get it going.  This burns some energy and gets the kids outside which are huge pluses in my book since I have very high energy kids.  I would say this ride on would be appropriate for an even younger child than my daughter.  If you have a child as young as three years then I would say go for it as they could get a few years of use out of this one purchase.", "This is a well built, sturdy ride on for small children.  I like it better than the plasma cars because your child uses their arms and legs.  My little kids love it!  The limitation for this toy is the size.  For larger kids, I would say 8 and up, I would recommend this:Ezyroller Ultimate Machine Special LimitedYou can extend the length on these for taller, larger children.  These haven't worked for my smaller children however, so I would lean towards the radio flyer in that case.Again, I would definitely recommend this ride on for those ages 3 to 8, but once the child gets too big, they will need to move on to the other.", "We live on a hill at the end of a street. the kids had a blast taking turns ridding it. We went on youtube to look at some of the tricks so the kids cab see what it actually does, They had a lot of . great workout for the kids. This is sturdy and it took awhile to put together. the kids was all amazed at all of the tricks you do and do not have to peddle. Great for a little chunky guy or gal to exercise while playing.", "\"It took me 21 minutes to put this together, including finding the right tools. The biggest difficulty was opening the box, and putting the screws in to connect the back wheel section. You'll just need a wrench (10MM) for the seat screws, otherwise everything is included.I wasn't sure how this would work with our living conditions--we live in a townhouse with a a sort of bumpy paved front driveway. No problem! This thing glides and slides fantastic!My 2 1/2 year old was able to figure it out a little inside the house, where we have hardwood floors, and the ziggler glides great. Outside it's a bit more challenging, but he could do it if he tried hard enough (he didn't). So I ended up tethering a rope to the front and pulling him around (this is probably breaking Radio Flyer rules so I don't recommend it &lt;wink>). My son LOVED the ride! It's a smooth ride, too. He's tall for his age... I think he's 38\"\" or 39\"\" tall, and his feet just reach the footrests. My 4 1/2 year old can work this perfect, and it didn't take much time for him to figure it out. He can make it up small hills and loves to glide down and twist.Overall this is an amazing toy! It's well built and well designed, not just cheap plastic. I'm having to go to the store and buy another one, because the two kids are already fighting over who's turn it is.Buy it! It's worth it.UPDATE: Just wanted to report that a couple of months after playing with this toy one of the wheels (left front) started to seize up. It felt like it hadn't been gliding as well as when we first bought it, and then it finally seized up completely. I took the wheel off and found the ball bearings were falling out because the plate that covers them was falling off. Not sure how this could have happened with the kid's use because it's a covered part of the wheel. I researched and found Radio Flyer warranty's the product for up to 1 year, so I called and got a free wheel sent to us in about 7 business days. I replaced the wheel and everything works like new ~ go Radio Flyer!\"", "Well, it's Radio Flyer so you know it will be sturdy--which is a good thing since it was meant for my four-year-old but my two six-year-olds, eight-year-old, twelve-year-old and thirteen-year-old all enjoy riding it too.  It's not like any other bike/scooter in terms of its movement.  The closest I can think of is the plasma car but that's no where near as fun as the ziggle (and the plasma car is hard to control which isn't the case with the ziggle given the easy-to-use handle bars).  A very fun ride that everyone wanted to try.", "This was very easy to assemble, and kids LOVE riding it. However, it seems a bit on the small side to me for the price and age range.  My daughter turns 8 next month and is tall for her age.  She is unable to ride it.  I realize it's not Radio Flyer's fault that she's tall, but it is incredibly disappointing.The neighborhood kids range in age from 3 - 12.  The 3-8 year olds love riding the Ziggle!  Obviously, the older the child, the more they can do.  However, that just makes the younger kids try even harder.", "The ziggle racer was surprisingly easy to assemble.  It came in 3 or 4 parts that you had to put together.  It is lightweight, but feels pretty sturdy, not as sturdy as the old Radio Flyers, but it's not cheapo plastic either.  It is fairly simple to ride, just move the handlebars in a side to side motion.  Going in a straight line is easy, turning can be difficult, but that is part of the fun.If you buy this, you will need a large area to use it in.  My driveway is gravel, so it does not work there. Sidewalks are too narrow.  We have to take it to the park with a blacktop in order to truly use and enjoy it.  So I recommend this if you have a large space to use it in.", "The Radio Flyer Ziggie Ride on is the best bike my kids have had. They put their feet on the front bar and move their feet back and forth to make the bike move. It gets my kids off the couch and out exercising, and burning energy. They love this bike more than any other bike they have had. Highly recommended!!", "I am giving a &#34;pre-review&#34; because I was able to order this Radio Flyer Ziggle Ride On from the Amazon Vine Program and plan to give it to my grandson for his birthday.  What I can say now is that my grandson's best friend (both boys are 4 and a half) has one and my grandson absolutely loves it.  He talks about how much fun it is, whenever he comes home from his friend's house.  I can also say that my grandson's parents are thrilled that I am giving their son this Ziggle Ride on for Christmas.  The friend's mom has  highly recommended it, because it is very durable and can take the &#34;beating&#34; her boys give.  So, just based on the good recommendation from my grandson's friend and his mother, I'm giving this product 4 stars. I've never seen a Radio Flyer wagon, scooter or sled that wasn't excellent quality, so I expect this Ziggle Ride on to be the same.  I'll report back in after Christmas and change the number of stars, if warranted.", "\"Out of this box this required about 30 minutes to assemble, at least for this relatively un-handy mom. My on-the-small-side (approx. 38 lb.) six-year-old son then hopped on and took off, gliding down the driveway and quickly figuring out how to spin out and slide sideways at a good speed.A veteran of thePlasmaCar, he immediately got the motion to make the bike move, and enjoyed the wilder aspects of the ride, though the declared the simple wiggle back and forth creep, \"\"boring.\"\" Though this is definitely faster than the Plasma, which he's kind of out grown, though does still play with now and again. He was pretty quickly pushing it to its limits and with a bit of a hill (slightly sloped driveway) and a sharp handle yank, he figured out how to make this thing really move and spin multiple 360s.As a bit of a daredevil, he's probably close to the top of the age range for this, but size-wise he's well within the dimensions of the ride-on, which seems fairly sturdy once assembled. (Not that an adult should be jumping on it; but it does say it works up to 80 lbs, and my son is about half that.) The only part that doesn't seem to be high quality, is the plastic adjustable seat, which felt a little flimsy (and breakable) to me. We'll see how that holds up.All in all, it's a nice addition, seems reasonably priced for what it is and I like that it's a non-electric, kid-powered vehicle.\"", "I never would have thought to get this strange-looking riding toy if the 6 and 7 year old brothers that live on my block didn't each have one and generously took turns letting my 4-year old grandson ride it. Actually, it looks like fun and it looks like good exercise so I got one for him. I like for him to be outside and interacting with other children instead of inside interacting with an electronic game on the I-Pad or watching TV, no matter how educational these activities are supposed to be.If you just see the picture, you wonder how it runs. The child twists the handle bars as fast as he can while applying similar pressure with his feet on the cross bar in the front. His whole body wiggles creating the momentum and the thing just propels forward in a surprisingly clean motion and smooth ride.  It all happens very fast and at the same time so it's hard to describe. It doesn't move backwards, but the children manage to spin it around to change direction and keep going surprisingly (but not dangerously) fast.It is rated as being for 3 to 8 years old and I think that is accurate. It is very entertaining (even to watch) and they are using their whole bodies and heaven knows how many different muscles. Having several on the block adds a competitive and social element that keeps them playing outside. Now that my grandson has his own, with the seat in the correct position for his size, he is even more excited about it and his movements are more effective. By the way, it was pretty easy to assemble.As a bonus, it is surprisingly solid and well-built--especially for something so reasonably priced. It looks like something you can keep and hand down to the next child.", "Super fun to play with but no &#34;reverse&#34;--I compared this our PlasmaCar experiences since we have two PlasmaCars and have played with them extensively we were excited to try the Ziggle.First impression: Nice build quality (mostly metal compared to the all plastic PlasmaCar), more room compared to a PlasmaCar. Generally the same experience in riding except no reverse!After decent testing over 10 days: The metal started creaking and moaning over time. Still requires a smooth, flat and clean surface--think a painted floor not rough sidewalks, for the best experience. Somehow seemed to be more dependant on arm motion than the PlasmaCar, perhaps the exact weight had something to do with that. Riding times seemed to be a bit shorter with the Ziggle than with the PlasmaCar. And while the reverse doesn't work as well as going forward on PlasmaCars, the complete lack of reverse on this item began to be more of a let down as no one really wants to stand up and lift the item to turn it around if they fail to turn out of a corner correctly.So in conclusion, I like the product, feel it is a great value and certainly would recommend it but you might want to check out PlasmaCars as well at the same time. They both have pros and cons compared to each other but are lots of repeat play time and a purchase you certainly will not regret!I hope this review has helped you. Please let me know if you have any questions."], "Gamma": [0.02787761576473713, 0.039245788007974625, 0.022191131487488747, 0.022506052628159523, 0.021317508071660995, 0.022940905764698982,
