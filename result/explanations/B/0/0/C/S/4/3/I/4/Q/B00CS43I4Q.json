This Skiva product is indeed an Apple Certified cable and works great!", "These are very heavy duty. The thickness of the cord is at least 50% more than the standard apple cord. We will see if this adds up to greater durability but a good start. They are fairly stiff however.NO errors including on iPhone 5 running iOS 7 beta 3", "I hate Apple's tiny little short cables that they provide with their products.  Nor does Apple even sell long cables.  This cable does the trick.  Great price, too!", "I'm pleased with my purchase. Although the cable is a touch pricey, I'm pleased with it - enough that I now own two (one for me, one for the missus). It charges my iPhone 5s without a hitch. It works well with the cases I own (two different models). Nice and long. The cable is more heavy-duty than the stock (bundled) Apple cable, but not so heavy that it's hard to work with. Pleased.", "This is a 10', durable, heavy duty cable that is certified by Apple. I have tested it out on Apple power plugs and it has charged every device, with iOS 7.1 on each one. I highly recommend and will be purchasing more.", "The Apple Lightening cables that came with the products tend to be on the short side. A ten foot cable would be enough to fit most needs. The Skiva is nice and long and works well. It is a bit thicker and less flexible than the originals. I don't know if the it has to be thicker if it is longer.", "I personally believe this should be the cable that comes with the iPad.  It is long enough, sturdy enough and allows greater freedom of movement with your device while it charges.", "The Skiva 10 ft Lightning Cable is a fantastic product. Unlike the stock/OEM Lightning cable, this puppy is 10 long feet, meaning you can sit in bed and read on your iPad, you can send email via your iPad from the couch, or listen to music on you iPod while walking around the kitchen and it charges (OK, no one is likely to try that last one, it was the only idea I had for what to do with the iPod). You can also charge a device from the back of your car using the front cigarette lighter adapter! Or if you mount your phone in the car for GPS, this will guarantee you can keep it charging while driving and have cable to spare.As long as you need a Lightning connector for your iOS device, then this cable will work for you.The build quality is very good. It's solid and I can't find a single flaw.The cable is Apple certified, which means they approve of the design (but like all &#34;certified&#34; products, that doesn't mean Apple endorses it). The cable works well for charging AND synching, if you find you still sync after the invention of iCloud.Another use case I just realized, and a reason I will probably buy a second, is to keep this plugged into the BACK of my computer. Right now, I use up 1 of the 2 front USB ports, and have 3 open in the rear that I never use. Now I can just keep the cable plugged in and be &#34;lazy&#34; about it.Highly recommended for your longer than normal Lightning Cable needs.I received a free sample from Skiva for review purposes.", "The cord work then I got it then less than a month it stop working. I then ordered another one then that cord stop working too. I would not recommend this cord to a friend to purchase.", "Man is this cable a tough cable. Gets me thinking if it might be too tough lol Reason for buying it was because I was sick and tired of all my cables fraying at the neck or part of the cable itself. Looked around and noticed that Skiva cables were highly recommended. They weren't kidding. This thing is rigid and I don't think I have to worry about it fraying for a while, or ever. The 10 feet it provides is just awesome for being far away from my charging point yet still charging my iPhone or iPad."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0976904034614563, 0.06024041026830673, 0.10287719964981079, 0.11837610602378845, 0.04239918291568756, 0.12030549347400665, 0.11145593225955963, 0.13352060317993164, 0.11413641273975372, 0.0989982858300209]]}
