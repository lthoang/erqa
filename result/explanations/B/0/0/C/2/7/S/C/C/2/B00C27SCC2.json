In the end, the thieving features in Skyrim or Oblivion, were more rewarding - and that is pretty much all I wanted this game to surpass: a minor feature in another game. Is it fair to compare this game to Skyrim? Heck yes! At least to the way the stealing in that game played.In the end, for whatever my opinion is worth to your decision to buy, the stages felt very planned - you knew where you were supposed to be, or do to complete what ever goal they wanted. The stealth, done in a firs person, is pretty painful. In crouching mode, you can't even see over tables and in drawers. It feels like a shooter shoved into a stealth game. I wasn't a fan of Dishonored, and it feels like this game offers even less than that game offered. I could have looked past the open world, to this mess of levels and incoherent story plots (for me, at least), if there was -something- special about this game. The graphics are just OK (perhaps Last Of Us raised the bar on the prev. gen too high, and maybe that's an unreasonable expectation), however, there is nothing special about this game. I have zero desire to play it. If I were to ignore all the tedious &#34;open drawer, grab single item, close drawer, open other drawer, rinse and repeat until the room is cleared and you made minor change&#34;, then, well, why am I even bothering with this game.Three stars... average... nothing special... if this is your thing... I could easily have saved the chit and re-rolled a Fallout character and been probably more entertained.", "Graphics are good but this doesn't live up to the hype of the previews. You are limited to the actions you take and the actual theft the game takes me back a few console generations. I wished I could have played this first before buying it. Too bad redbox doesn't have PS4 games in my area.", "\"I am not going to give up on this game yet, but after my first night, I am very disappointed.The cut scenes are longer than the game play and they tell you exactly what to do at every step in the game.The AI was completely wacked out in the last part I played.  I broke into a house and chased a guy up the stairs.  I knocked him out and a bunch of guards chased me out the door I came in.  I ran down the alley and I heard one of the guards giving up on finding me.  OK so far.  Then I go back and WALK IN THE SAME DOOR I WENT IN AND RAN OUT OF ORIGINALLY WHICH IS STILL WIDE OPEN!  \"\"Hey, maybe we should close this door since the thief came in this way.....NAH!\"\"Then I go upstairs and while there are a bunch of guards still lurking about, the body of the guy I knocked out is still laying in the same place, and no one is tending to him.  \"\"We all work for this guy and he is lying knocked out on the ground, but lets not bother trying to help him\"\"And then, just minutes after all the excitement of my big break-in, I find a guard asleep in one of the rooms.This AI is not ready for next gen consoles.UPDATE-3/5/2014 - I lied.  I sold the game without giving it any more time.\"", "\"If you know Thief, you know Garrett, and you know the premise. A master thief with a strictly non-violent approach who takes on jobs around his decrepit city. During a heist at a mansion with his vicious former apprentice, Erin, Garrett observes something and is knocked into a coma for a year, waking to find the city being ravaged by a plague and strangled by the police policies of the Baron. But all that loot is just waiting there for the taking.Graphics are sublime. Your hands are regularly visible, and the detailing on even the subtle things, such as boxes, books, and candles is wonderful. The city has a cramped, claustrophobic feel, but not one that makes you feel railroaded, with dozens of crisscrossing catwalks and overhands.Audio is similar. Garrett is wonderfully voiced as a calm, calculating thug. The other characters you meet are oft times caricatures of tried and true cliches (mad scientist, tyrannical guard) they had crucial elements, and other characters are so novel and well done its a treat to hide in the shadows and listen to the tiny slices of their lives.Gameplay is where the game both makes its greatest marks and loses its fifth and fourth star. Certain elements of the shadow motion are wonderfully done. You can slink within arms reach of a guard and not be spotted if you play your cards right. You can get by without any tools, but they do make life so much easier. The bow is well balanced and you find yourself using it as a tool rather than a crutch. Guards pay attention, so if you leave a safe open, they'll know you're nearby. However, other elements are frustrating and annoying. Certain noises wake the dead, such as missing a single tumbler in a lock can rouse the whole area. Certain elements that're obviously scripted break down at random times. I spent 10 minutes waiting for a servant to finish polishing a glass and leave before I realized the system had locked up. Distractions oft times do nothing except alert enemies, and many times they would not go investigate, and just stand locked in place, while I fumed at having to unnecessarily kill 2 more people to get at a crucial piece of loot. And navigating the city is nothing short of asinine. I spent hours trying to find a window to go through or a rooftop to climb to reach a door to the bank job, only to find I had to slink through an unmarked gap in some crates three blocks away.Nits do abound. The \"\"predator\"\" aspect is so easy to invoke, and the rational between opportunist and ghost is ridiculous if you're trying to be a master thief. Certain areas and quick moves can kill you because of a button hang up, meaning you'll jump off the roof rather than go down the ladder you're standing in front of.Overall, a great thief game with a wonderful look and feel, which requires several patches to finish polishing the handling and rework to navigation to make it not absurdly stupid, and this would be five stars.\"", "Thief is a really good action/adventure game. As an adult gamer, I found it to be pretty entertaining & appropriately challenging. It's not perfect, but not terrible either. If you liked the other Thief games & ones like Dishonored etc., then you may like this as well. Then environment is great. The missions are pretty good. The gameplay is fun. I'm not the biggest stealth fan, but I found the stealth elements challenging & fun- not impossible as in some games. There are some downsides as you can't climb everything, and I wish there were more houses/rooms to break into to steal things. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it- but I'd try to get it cheaper than retail- which I try to do for every game!", "I played all the Thief games and this game is good but mostly a disappointment.It's not a 10/10 rating game or anything less than a 5, but it's an above average game when it comes to the Thief legacy. It's very difficult to not compare it to its heir apparent Dishonored as that game was everything Thief should have been. Dishonored is a classic in not only gameplay but storytelling as well.This Thief game has its moments and it never gets old creeping around and stealing stuff and collecting artifacts which is the primary reason I have scrored it a seven. The flaws that keep it from getting an 8, 9 or 10 rating are the following:- Very hallow generic game, not much life in it and the storyline doesn't help either. Not that great.- Loot is everywhere which can be a bad thing since your constantly hitting square collecting things. Not sure why we need to see an animation of him swiping stuff.- Garrett talks too much. Seriously though the acting could be a bit better and the animations sometimes come off as cheezy or last generation quality. Overall I'm not sure I like the Joaquin Phoenix look of Garrett or his sidekicks.Overall the game is fun but not worth the money. It definitely has value in the $20-$30 range but I can't recommend this especially for die hard Thief fans because it's pretty different from the older games.Nice try but hopefully Square Enix and Eidos Montreal have better luck on a sequel or better yet let someone else do it.--------------Edit - I had to edit the review to point out two more things I did not mention, one a positive and one a negative.Good:The game is completely adjustable, almost every setting in the game can be changed such as difficulty levels, turning off or on your focus, the enemy AI, turning off knock outs so you can't knock guards out etc. This makes the game highly replayable as missions can be replayed after finishing the game but there's a caveat to this, see below.Bad:Wandering the city is horrible which may make you not want to replay the game. The map is terrible. The mini map is atrocious. There are no waypoints, markers you can set and no fast travel. The entire city is a twisted maze of passages and without a jump button (the game focus on auto navigation) it becomes a frustrating mess of a time waster just getting from one mission to the next. Hiding from guards in the city serves no purpose. Killing them also serves no purpose as they respawn when you re-enter the map and it has no bearing on the story-line at all. Trying to find your bearing at times can test your nerves to the extreme. This part of the game has seriously not been thought through and it is one of things that can break the game for most people rendering it nearly unplayable at times.My review still stands as a somewhat above average game.", "The beginning of the game starts very slow but starts to pick up in the middle. Story is decent at best. Its all about gameplay so if you like stealthy games then this is a good buy...when it gets a price drop. Not worth $60.GraphicsOn PS4 it looks good but not great, FPS- It gets a bit choppy at one point but after that it was smooth sailing.2.8/5", "Thief was a game I never played in previous incarnations and had heard many good things about. Many have said Thief gave rise to Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed and Metal Gear.Some of those games that it gave rise to, I wish that Thief would have also taken notes from them.Don't get me wrong, it's not an entire mess of a game but for all the hype especially as one of the first games to arrive post next-gen launch it fell short of what I was expecting.The story itself is a bit muddy as somehow the main protagonist Garrett working alongside his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Erin end up at a mansion with some shadowy cult opening up a gateway in which Erin falls through and is presumably killed.  Garrett wakes up later and apparently has new thieving powers (a'la Batman's Detective mode) to help him traverse his terrain.  So it's up to Garrett to solve the mystery of the cult ad find out what happened to Erin.What is interesting is that this game plays almost like the thieving version of Skyrim.  If it isn't bolted down, take it and for everything you steal you automatically get credits towards upgrading your skills and weapons which would be fine, but Garrett is supposed to be a master thief so why is the game predicated on you being a petty thief and stealing everything?  One aspect I do like about the game which I wish more games of this genre would do is how it goes about dealing with light sources.  Garrett works best in the dark and in certain areas, Garrett has the ability to extinguish light sources with sometimes a simple switch or blowing the lights out or something more elaborate such as a water arrow.  While dousing some of these lights in the game is great there is still the questionable AI that I have a problem with.  A few times I have used a water arrow to only have the AI make a note of it via voice dialogue but not move to re-light it.  On other occasions, I have put lights out using other methods and the AI comes running along to light it right back up.  It's just very inconsistent on how this is done.One of biggest issues I had early on was I was stealing a mask in a house and was trying to make my way out and the house was pretty dark except for a woman reading a book with a guard stationed outside of her room.  I wanted to distract her to steal something else and just for the hell of it, I threw a bottle on the other side of the room which broke, very loudly.  To that, she only commented about who is there and the guard woke up and then dozed back off.  REALLY???!!???  So nobody is going to investigate a shattered bottle on the other side of the room in a dark house??  Ok then.Other issues I have had are with the controls.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  Lock-picking is a straightforward method that is reminiscent of Skyrim which works great.  But sometimes walking to a box or a drawer to open it for pilfering doesn't always work.  Sometimes if you aren't positioned `just so', you can't get the item.  Sometimes I have to double press the button just to get it to work.Combat is another issue with this game as this is one thing that Eidos didn't steal (pun intended) from Skyrim.  Garrett can barely manage his own against one opponent but the second he gets ganged up on, it's over.  And because he has this `do not kill' philosophy, swords are out and most of his opponents are packing to kill so my advice is if you alert too many guards, just run.  I will say this however, if you die, the save points are generous in placing you where you left off.Another issue is that unlike more modern games like Assassins Creed, there aren't many places for you to climb and you don't have that freedom to maneuver like you would in other games and the play-map is a mixed bag but at least you have the option of a guide-point on your HUD to direct you to your next location.  One thing that I heard complaints about was the constant loading the game has to do when you go from location to location.  I am fine with this actually as sometimes I have hated to have to travel from one point in a town to another like in Assassins Creed. BUT, the load times can take a while.  It's not game breaking but it's worrying.Graphically, Thief is really a mixed bag on the PS4.  Some of the cutscenes tend to stutter and for many of the characters in game, their facial models look very last gen especially Erin.  This was probably one of the things that dropped my expectations the most.  The City itself however looks really good at some points with the hi-res treatment that it got but I do wish that there was some kind of day/night cycle even if it was early morning and sunset and not just dark all of the time. Some of the light sources and water sources are good but if that is all going on for it graphically, then why bother?  For this to be a AAA title, I was expecting so much more in this game graphically.So is there anything likeable about this game?  The stealth aspects are cool as advertised; you can approach a mission in multiple ways.  So far I have tried completing levels with as very little contact as possible and so far I have done ok in doing it.  There is a ton of stuff to find if you have patience and a lot of side missions to do.  This game will hold me over for a short time at least until Titanfall comes out in a few weeks.", "This is by far the most underrated game for the next generation of consoles. This is in my opinion, the greatest PS4/Xbox One game on the market as of now. The graphics are absolutely stunning. You really have to experience them for yourselves. I was lucky to live near one of the few places that had mid night release, so I am coming off of about 4 hours of gameplay. I just bought an amazon version for a friend who was a fan of Skyrim and Dishonored.And that is what this game looks like. It looks like it was published by Bethesda, rather than Square Enix Montr&eacute;al. The graphics are crisp, and clear. The interface could get some getting used to since the touchpad is new for me, but you can change the settings if you wanted to.It's not just about the graphics which really sink in about this game, it's the main character Garett who I love the most. He himself is such a great character. He steals, but finds killing wrong. He only kills when it is necessary. That is what stealth games are all about.Even if you are not a fan of stealth games, you would still enjoy this great game. It is about manipulating your surroundings to best fit you, whether that is blowing out a candle or shooting a fire pit with a water arrow. There are also multiple ways to do things. In one of the missions, you have to break into a manor. There are about 3 different ways to do this, so you control your path.Pros:Great GraphicsDetailed Story lineManipulatable SettingsGreat selection of toolsCons:Weird interface (can be changed in settings)Overall, this game is the game to get. I can see pumping just as many hours as I did Skyrim into this game, as it is well worth it.If you subscribe to my youtube channel Gandalf The Teal I will be posting Thief gameplays. Just search Gandalf The Teal in the search bar, I should be the only channel.Thank you for taking the time to read the whole thing and if you found this review helpful in any way, please leave a like. If you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them in the comments! I love to help people out and definitely would love to talk about anything about the game.EDITAfter reading around the internet, I have noticed that this game has gotten some rather bad reviews from top sites. I do not agree with any of these. It is just your decision in the end, and it is up to you to choose. I have gotten through the first 3 missions, and I love it. It is my favorite game for the PS4.  If you need any help, my youtube page will have some gameplays. The link is above. Thank you for reading and have a nice day!", "I had highly anticipated the release of this game and I really wanted to like it, but in the end I found it to just be rather mediocre.  I played about 4 chapters into this game before deciding to trade it in on something else.  I didn't hate the game necessarily, but it left a bit to be desired.Breaking into places and picking locks & sneaking around & thieving valuables etc was fun at first, but eventually just got rather monotonous and lost it's luster.  Traveling around the city & squeezing through crevices etc got to the point where it seemed like a chore...became repetitive and/or tedious, and was sometimes confusing.  I personally had a hard time deciphering the map as well and was hard to distinguish where to go when I was trying to find certain places again or the merchant to buy materials etc.  I even got rather confused trying to find my way to the area in the 4th chapter.  Some people might have had no trouble there, but I am among many people whose navigational skills aren't always that keen, and having a confusing map to look at did not help matters.Graphically Thief was not all that impressive, it seemed more like mid era PS3 graphics to me than eye popping PS4 graphics...and the frame rate was certainly not PS4 quality, compared to what I'd seen with games like Assasssin's Creed Black Flag or Tomb Raider Definitive Edition etc.  Graphically it was often somewhat choppy as well and character movements were sometimes choppy as well.  There were parts where character mouth movements didn't exactly match words being spoken, or was just a monotonous up & down motion.Some of the environments in the game seemed fairly interesting and gothic, which I thought was neat, but much of the area left a bit to be desired, especially when gazing off across the city or a large expanse of space...much of the distant horizon seemed somewhat broken up & choppy.The story seemed fairly interesting, but with all the many faults if this game I just simply could not bring myself to continue on with the game.  Just another attempt to profit off of an otherwise classic game.  I've never played the original PC game before so I can't attest to what it was like, but I have read reviews by others who have said it does not do the classic game any justice, and I believe it, judging from what I experienced myself on this PS4 version.There are some who I have read enjoyed this game, and there may be others of you who do too...to each their own.  However, I felt it was a feeble attempt on PS4 and I would recommend renting it before buying and see for yourself whether or not you are going to like it.  Even though I gave it a 2.5, I did give click the upper end of the spectrum at 3 because it's not exactly a terrible game, but it's definitely not a very good game.", "\"So outside of Knack and Killzone:  Shadow Fall, this is the first AAA title that wasn't a port of a PS3/PSN game released for the PS3, with great anticipation, ushering in the new generation properly.And while Thief does has its moments, it's ultimately a letdown.The 15 minute preview video I watched of the first mission boasted \"\"There are multiple ways to approach this; what follows is just one method\"\".  Here's the problem:  The game FORCES you into scenarios.  Doors/windows/hatches close behind you.  Want to drop down?  Sometimes you can without a button press, sometimes it requires a button press, and sometimes you can't at all, even if it appears you can.  There is a grand illusion at work in \"\"The City\"\" (really?  In 2014, that's the best you can come up with?  talk about an \"\"F\"\" for originality!) that you can be a master thief and go anywhere, and do anything, to get the loot.  Not so.And, to make matters worse, by the midpoint of the game you will acquire a skill which will let you deal with guards with your fists if you're spotted (i.e. instead of being killed you'll kill them).  Essentially, this breaks the need to play stealth, and while that's appreciated for people who don't want to try to do an entire run of the game without being spotted on Master Thief difficulty, it does kinda defeat the purpose of a game built on a stealth premise.  Focus also pretty much makes the game broken, you can choose not to use it, then why offer it in the first place then?And even with the new generation of gaming systems, the enemy AI apparently is still stuck in the PS2 era as guards get stuck in the environment and will otherwise just ignore you all together unless you make it blatantly obvious (i.e. run smack into them, leave a dead body right in the middle of the room/street, etc).Finally, LOAD TIMES.  Wow.  Forget it if you expect a seamless transfer between environments.  You're looking at a 20-40 second load time EVERY time.  That is absolutely unacceptable in this generation of consoles, period.This seems like a game destined for a discount within the first 2-3 months of release and is NOT a game you should be paying full price for.  The in-game map is atrocious and almost unusable, enemy combat is handled with the triggers vs. the face buttons and is a poor man's version of the Arkham games, and while the graphics and sound are great, it reminds me of a saying \"\"If you put lipstick on a pig, it is still a pig\"\".So consider it 4 or 5 stars for the graphics, sound and potential replay value, and 1-3 stars (depending on your level of annoyance) with the U/I, controls, gameplay and overall polish.If that's something you're willing to pay $60 for, more power to you.  For all but the diehard Thief and stealth fans, save your money for Infamous: Second Son and Destiny; those games will be much more worth your money.\"", "This game is excellent, I do not understand all the naysayers giving one star. They must be old thief fans with different expectations and the graphics are actually some of the best on ps4. I think of this more of a hybrid of borderlands addictive grabbing loot, this case stolen jewels and splinter cell hide in shadows gameplay. If your running out killing everyone your playing wrong and your not playing on expert. Overall this is my favorite current game on ps4 next to kill zone and infamous. If you were interested I would def recommend it is a much better game reviewers and amazon raters are giving credit to.", "i got this on time and if i may i would love to say something to the Amazon Crew if I may..  every game that i purchase on this site has had been NOTHING but an INCREDIBLE experience for me and every time.  i am speaking the truth because you guys keep me up to date with my games, movies, etc.  i would recommend that everybody use this site because you guys just aren't awesome with the updating people on their stuff but you guys also are incredible careful with the stuff that I purchase.  i would highly recommend this site to everybody..there was nothing that i disliked about this game.. it is a blast to play.", "This is a great game for fan's of any RPG, especially Fall Out, Skyrim etc.  The lighting in the game makes for the mood and scene in the era, the controls are simple and utilizes every aspect of the new controller (touchpad).  A must have for the PS4.", "Save your money the gane got really boring a hour into it i felt like i was doin the same stiff over and over again", "I never played Thief before the PS4 so this type of game is new to me.  For the most part, it's first person with the occasional cut to third person (primarily for climbing).Your character is a thief who lurks in the shadows and &#34;steals&#34; things.  This is a combination of fun and mind-numbing boredom.  The fun is finding a new place to pillage but it's pretty boring searching cabinet-after-cabinet, draw-after-draw, prying open window-after-window.The challenge to thief is to find the hidden goodies that the game designers built in.  To get them all, you'd need an almost infinite amount of time, patience, skill and luck.  In other words: There are plenty of guides on the internet that have the combination to the safe if you can't figure it out.  Some places have puzzles or mazes and the guides help if you get stuck someplace for too long.Thief uses food to repair health and poppies to regain focus.  I prefer it when health regenerates slowly over time but that's a personal preference.The marketplace doesn't make sense.  Even if you complete every chapter, every side mission, every client job and loot every house, you'll still never have enough money to buy most marketplace items.  This make you decide to choose a direction for your character: archer, fighter, stealth, etc. and use all of your money and focus towards those skills and upgrades only.  The idea is that if you used to stealthing around, you probably don't need to upgrade your blackjack or bow.There are a lot of redundant button presses and movement when opening windows, picking locks, sliding through openings, etc.. Some kind of map assist feature would help because the route isn't obvious until you learn the maps.I'm generally not a big fan of Unreal games so begrudgingly I give Thief 4 stars because I played it for a decent amount of time before losing interest.", "If you are one of the haters listen up, this game is the bomb. Garrett is back in the fourth installment of the Thief series. This latest blockbuster is a tour-de-force in stealth, redefining the genre once again. If you don&#8217;t like it, prepare to be knocked out by the new powerful Garrett and his improved blackjack!If you thought Garrett was well equipped before, buckle yourself up son as he now has incredible supernatural powers! These let him see through walls, way better than having to look yourself like the other games. Rope arrows are back with some serious attitude, these help you more than ever before with the new and improved levels! Let&#8217;s face it, the levels of the first games were lame level design, those suckers were boring as hell, this time the emphasis is on the real deal; stealing stuff!You want a script, you got it! The story has plenty of wicked action and developed characters enough to satisfy you film fans out there. The dialogue is cranked up to 2014 and these dudes aren&#8217;t scared to tell you what they think. F-this and f-that, s-this and time to drop a c-bomb in there somewhere. Who needs that Old English stuff when you have proper swearing?Thief looks like a real boss! Prepare for an eyegasm the second you see it, followed by an intense eargasm! The music is insane and awesome! Oh yeah, the game plays awesome too as you can become a real thief and steal from peoples houses just like in Brixton - word to the massive!  How about more end-of-level bosses to mix up the action a bit? How about a zombie hordes mode for multiplayer? They could have a mode called Steal The Flag which would be awesome in Thief!So all you Thief fans won&#8217;t be disappointed as this game is a true soldier in the stealth war, guaranteed to keep the millions entertained until the next Battlefield! Anyone who disses this game needs to back up their stuff, this is the greatest game in this quality series so far.Graphics 10 &#8211; proper blazing showing the true potential of the XBONE and PS4 capabilitiesSound 10 &#8211; AMAZING sounds, it&#8217;s like an orchestra in my home!Gameplay 10 &#8211; Addicting as alcohol or any drug!Depth 9 &#8211; You can play it time and time again different and find new ways to play! Why no multiplayer though?!9/10", "As a huge fan of the original Thief games I was greatly looking forward to playing a new Thief adventure on the next-gen console. Thief has a classic style game play which is lost in many new games these days. This classic style is what us gamers asked for, and they pulled it off perfectly. It is just like the original Thief game in so many ways. They really took their time and made this as faithful to the original series as possible. With that being said, so much has changed over the past 15 years in the gaming world that I feel Thief has let us down a little as we have experience so much more in games.Pros:+ Decent Graphics. Went more for style than intense detail.+ The sounds are perfect! From little noises in you surrounds to eavesdropping on the sometimes hilarious conversations of the guards.+ There is so much to do as you progress through the game. Many side missions and side objectives in main story missions. The areas are large, and there is much to explore.+ The ability to save at anytime is a nice feature. Auto-saves are fairly often as well.+ Perfect Thief Environment and Dialog. Really brought back memories of the original Thief.+ There is a lot of re-playability. Between going back for items you didn't have the gadget for the first time around, to simply realizing you missed some loot when you thought you got it all. Also replaying a level a different way, maybe more stealthy.+ The AI is basic, yet very good. If a guard hears you or you cause a distraction, he'll change his usual walking pattern which makes getting around him more difficult.+ While the maps and missions are linear, there are many little secret places where you can find additional loot. You can take your time and search.+ The story is good, but takes a while to spike your interest. The further you get in the game the more interesting it gets.+ Aside from the 8 main story missions, there are 25 or so side missions, plus other missions as you meet/find new characters. Doing them will all greatly extend your play time.Cons:- Weird interruptions to load or have a video. Too many times where the control is taken away from the player. I want to play a game, not watch the game play out a scene for me.- There are too many times where you open a door or window or drop down and are then locked out of where you just came from. Yes they want you to progress further in the level, however this is frustrating if you are trying to get all the loot or complete the extra level objectives.- The game is quite linear. There are ways to approach enemies to kill or simply try and sneak by them, however there is only one way to get to where you need to go. I expected more adventuring and open world capabilities.- Sometimes it feels it's unavoidable to have to take a guard out. I want to be able to go through the game and not be noticed and not kill or knock out anyone, which is a trophy, but it's not always easy.- The story lacks at times making the game play a little slow and lifeless.- Sometimes platforming is frustrating as you can only climb and drop at particular times in particular places. Also basic control mechanics is a little wonky.- I hit a major glitch where a rope was not where it needed to be and I didn't have any rope arrows on me and none were available in my area, and I could not complete the mission. I had to revert back to the city (which is an option when you are in missions) and almost 3 hours of progress was lost. When I played it again the rope had loaded, which is very frustrating. Others have claimed the same glitch on multiple consoles. The game also locked up and shutdown (the game, not the PS4). Also I once got stuck in a wall and I saw a guard get stuck in a wall and start twitching until I got closer, then he killed me.- The map is very limited, by not utilizing symbols or a legend. It does not show starting points of the missions or where other areas open up. Very frustrating and the use of the internet to find what you're looking for is a must.Over-all this is a great game for classic gamers who played the original Thief games on the PC. If you liked the original games you'll love this because it is the same simple style. New comers will be thirsty for more and something more spectacular, especially on a new next-gen console. Those gamers new to Thief will probably get bored easily. Thief is a game where you need to be patient and take your time, something most kids these days don't have. Though there are times where the game seems to be holding back from how amazing it could be, it still is a solid game with an enjoyable game play experience. You can complete the game in under 15 hours or so, depending on the style in which you play and if you do any side missions. I took my time, did all side missions playing some twice to get all loot or thief challenges and ranked in just under 45 hours. My second play through I picked up no loot, didn't kill or knock-out anyone and simply ran through each level to complete the game on Master difficulty. It took me about 6 hours. Over-all, as I have already played through it twice and have 94% of the trophies, I won't be in a rush to play through it again. Maybe one day.I would have liked to see a little more creativity used in some spots throughout the story, however it is a very enjoyable game. Those on the fence may want to wait for the price to drop a little so they won't be disappointed, however faithful fans of the series should not hesitate. I must say, due to all the secrets and hidden loot, this is one of the few games where a walkthrough book may be useful.Highly Recommended!PSN: adrielaugust", "Controls - 5/10Camera Angles - 3/10Graphics - 7/10Audio - 6/10Redundancy - 9/10Difficulty - 7/10Overall Game Play - 5/10First thing to mention about this game is that it is and was intended to be a stealth based game. Those of you that play it like you would a FPS will be very disappointed.This game does offer many challenging puzzles throughout its course and a lot of good loot. Your objective: Steal as much as you can without getting caught, so if you play it as it was intended then there are moments you have to sit and wait for the right moment, you cannot just run through!I have 3 complaints with this game. The first was the audio, there were some points where the audio was so muffled that I had to turn subtitles on to know what was being said. Second was the game's camera angles, there were a few times where the environment got blocked by a wall, I could see nothing but the wall, I get spotted and I still can't see past the wall so I had to resort to blindly swinging until the gourd finished beating me down. Lastly, the first part of the game was off to a great start but after a few hours of game play things start to become very monotonous.If you like stealth and puzzles then you should check this game out but I would absolutely wait until the price drops a bit.", "\"I have never played Thief before but I'm a big fan of stealth games such as MGS and Splinter Cell, so I decided to give this a try. There are a few quirks that many reviewers have probably already mentioned, such as repetitive QTE sections (opening windows, sliding through gaps in walls, etc) that mask load screens, lengthy load times, and the limited freedom in a seemingly open environment. Also, some areas require you to press a button to drop down to the lower level, while some others do not. This type of inconsistency really took away the overall experience, which could have been much richer despite the detailed and atmospheric environments.A side note: it took me just under 10 hours to complete the game in \"\"easy\"\" mode.All in all, I enjoyed quite a bit of this game but I had hoped for more, and it had a potential to be a much better game. Let's hope for a follow-up to this game that addresses the numerous minor issues. If you are a die-hard stealth fan, I would definitely recommend this. If you haven't played a lot of stealth games or don't enjoy slower-paced games, I would say probably do a rental or pass.\"", "Very linear game compared to the free world game I was expecting.  I was hoping to be able to freely roam a city and and perform stealthy break ins while avoiding the law - there would be GTA style markers for buildings you needed to break into and items you needed to find - but overall a sandbox style game play.Instead the game is very restrictive to the point I quit playing after the first few chapters.", "I have heard complaints that this game is too linear or that the graphics aren't representative of a next gen console.  I disagree.  It is a great game to look at and a very fun game to play.  I like sneaking around and trying to find the loot.  I always seem to miss some, no matter how hard I look, but it is all good fun.  Lots of sneaking around and always a lock or safe to pick.  No complaints here.", "I love the Thief franchise.  I played Thief the Dark Project when it first came out and loved it.  It was my favorite first person shooter.  I thought of it like a game that changed everything.  It changed what I thought of as playing a thief in RPGs.  It changed the way I looked at first person shooters in general.  The story was simple too.  You were a thief and you bugled for a living and then one day you stumble on the house of a crazy evil wizard.  Your guild won't help you, the law won't help so you have to get rid of this guy and become the invisible hero of the city.  An unlikely hero and a guy who robbed a now dead evil wizard.Thief two was actually better.  Again you are the unlikely hero trying to take down a crazy priest that is obsessed with merging the mechanical and the flash using magic.  I will not spoil it because the story is just too good.Thief three you just kill a crazy witch.  It does not have a story as good as one or two but still felt like you were in the &#34;Thief&#34; world.(spoiler)This game looked amazing.  The trailer was so uplifting.  It promised so much.  I was so exited about this game I would have purchased a PS4 if it was only a PS4 game.  I'm giving this one star because I am hurt.  It is am emotional response because I have loved the franchise so much.  First off the game plays kinda like tomb raider.  The story is boring.  Garrot does not save the city.  Actually he fails.  Everyone is getting sick and some lunatic burns down half the city because you were obsessed with finding out what happened to your apprentice.  Ok fine Garrot failed, sometimes heroes fail but I think Garrot made some choices in this game the old Garrot would not have that led to the destruction of the city.  Believe it or not saving the city is not the main plot line of the game.  Screw the city!?!  You have to find out what happened to your apprentice who you thought was dead because so looked dead when she fell and died and stuff.  Anyway you find her and she is like a crazy energy ball boss who does not know what he is doing and she dies again the end.You loose the city, your apprentice and you have a lot of money but you can't even blow it on ale drinking yourself to death because the bar is burned down.", "\"\"\"Thief\"\" delivers effectively on its premise--putting you in the shoes of master thief Garret, and having you explore the shadowy Victorian, Gothic, steam punk-style environment known only as \"\"The City,\"\" sneaking about and stealing all manner of shiny trinkets. The lesser trinkets are scattered all around the over-world, sometimes hidden in vaults, locked in drawers, or just sitting in plain sight, while more unique pieces are the reward at the end of a well-executed theft mission. There are 9 main thieving missions, each of them long with multiple areas and pathways to take, as well as numerous optional side missions to help earn extra coin for upgrades. This is a game that oozes brooding atmosphere, with eerie fog washing over buildings and down cobblestone streets, and with thick beams of moonlight cutting through windows and alleyways. Light is of great importance in \"\"Thief.\"\" It's easy to be detected if you're in it which is why you have access to a number of useful tools: water arrows that can extinguish flames, rope arrows to reach high-up alternate routes, and a new \"\"swoop\"\" ability to quickly dash in and out of shadows. \"\"Thief\"\" does a very particular thing, and it does it very well. It may not reach the great heights of \"\"Dishonored\"\" or \"\"Human Revolution,\"\" but it's an exemplary example of the genre.--- 4.5 STARS ---\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.002509544836357236, 0.07940110564231873, 0.03777259215712547, 0.016192611306905746, 0.01688201166689396, 0.03700545057654381, 0.05574989691376686, 0.014630558900535107, 0.11332201957702637, 0.0009690846200101078, 0.0025990293361246586, 0.005950422957539558, 0.05414162948727608, 0.05135346204042435, 0.07232166826725006, 0.0464610680937767, 0.02545127645134926, 0.06405940651893616, 0.01460112165659666, 0.051152873784303665, 0.09234339743852615, 0.058574315160512924, 0.06302893906831741, 0.02352656051516533]]}
