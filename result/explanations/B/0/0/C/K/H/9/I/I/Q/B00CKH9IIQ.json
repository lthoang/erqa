This one was no exception.I have to admit, I was a little surprised. You can NOT take her dress off to switch clothing with other dolls as you can with any other Barbie. It's permanently attached to her body, as it seems to be a special \"\"see through\"\" fabric which allows the user to see the electric designs that flow across her midriff. I thought this was a drawback... but I'M not the one playing with it. She is, and she didn't seem to care at all.Other than that, this Barbie seems to have all the standard features of all the rest.One thing I need to mention is that allegedly you can \"\"draw\"\" electronic designs in the display using an included plastic stylus. Well... good luck on that. The box shows a very tidy design drawn on Barbie's midriff, but the best we could achieve was a basically shapeless blob. Sometimes not even that; the display plane doesn't seem to be very responsive to touch input from the stylus or any other device (pencil, finger, etc.).The one other thing I do have to note, as have other reviewers, is the way the doll is fastened into the packaging. Why has Mattel started running those little plastic fasteners through her hair, making them almost impossible to remove without chopping into her hairdo? What genius came up with THAT? How about a plastic strap around her neck or forehead instead?Overall, it's fun, though maybe a little pricey.\"", "Let's get the bad things out of the way first.- While this is a barbie, and appears to be the same size/dimensions as the normal barbies, her legs do not bed at all, she is permanently stranding straight up.  And while some barbie accessories work (like shoes) the dress is not replaceable, and she permanently has her necklace on (this is the  controls).- Batteries.  We've only had the item for around a month and we're already on our second set of batteries.  She doesn't get much use, and it might be that the batteries that she came with were low to begin with.  Also, the batteries are in her legs, one in each leg.  It's a bit weird.So now the good stuff.Barbie has three modes, design, animate and sound.  Design lets you choose different colors/letters and with the stylus select/touch on the resistive touch screen the is under the front of Barbie's dress.  It seems quite easy to do, our three year old daughter does not have any issues with it, and she doesn't always know how to go back and design something, it still captures her attention for awhile.The sound reactive mode.  This one is a crowd pleaser.  When in sound mode, a microphone within Barbie reacts to noise.  This means our 3 year old and our one and a half year old carry her around in this mode making as much noise as they can to see it react.  Keep in mind it doesn't require near this amount of noise to react to, but try telling them that.There is a stand that comes in a few parts.  Plastic base with room for a stylus, plastic rod that clips into it, and a clip that goes around Barbie's waist.  This holds Barbie up nicely and provides a place to put Barbie.  The clip is a bit hard for our three year old, but other than that it makes it so it's just not thrown into the toy bin.This Barbie is a Barbie in a sense, she looks a Barbie, she has the stylings, and fits into the world, but really can't be used like a Barbie, unless your child keeps them on a shelf and just looks at them.  So in that sense it's a bit of a disappointment, but on it's own it's an entertaining toy, that happens to look like a Barbie.", "This doll is super gimmicky, but my six-year-old loves it! She already loves Barbie, and the option to customize her dress is awesome! I probably wouldn't have bought it for her because she is hard on her dolls, but that is just me.", "Barbie goes digital. Why not? Everything else is. This Barbie is loads of fun. I cannot imagine any little girl not being thrilled with it. The price is reasonable, you know it is excellent quality-although I did rate the durability midline because I am not sure what happens when the battery goes. Overall, it is a great toy and we are very pleased. If my daughter didn't already have it, it would be on the Christmas shopping list.", "PROS:  She comes with killer shoes and a cute bracelet. Both are removable. She comes with a neat stand so that she can be placed on display. Her face is beautiful. Her hair is lovely and thick.CONS: Like her dress? No? Too bad it can't be removed unless you cut it off. (It's actually attached in the front to her display.) And if you do, I'm not sure what you'd put her in that would fit or would allow her digital screen to be visible. She has an odd flat fronted figure and a wider body than the usual Barbie.I really hate that it seems to be that piercing a doll's head with plastic ties to hold her in place is becoming standard procedure. Maybe it's me, but I always end up with plastic stuck in the doll's head. Wire around the neck will be fine to hold her in position.Only her arms and her head move. She cannot sit because her display is in her middle. She cannot bend her knees or move her legs at all because the 2 AAA batteries used to power the display are in her legs.Learning how to work the display requires the instruction manual. So be sure not to loose it.2.5 STARS: This poor Barbie will not mingle with the other dolls. She can't sit and chat with them. Nor can she swap clothes with them. The only thing she can ever hope to be is their nightlight. My daughter played with it for a couple of days before putting her on her stand and abandoning her.", "\"What more would you expect as Barbie moves further into the digital world? Her \"\"Clothes\"\" can now store up to 40 programs (as the techies would call it) or outfits as your daughter will call it. Even Dad will want to play with this one though, because it's just that cool.Of course there is also an option to have the LED's dance to music or other ambient sounds, which is pretty neat with the lights out.This will probably be a pretty big hit this holiday season, but I haven't seen much in the way of marketing for it yet.It is a little odd with the batteries being in the legs, but you've got to get a decent power source somewhere and pancake cells just won't hack it.Educational I wouldn't call it that, but it is very interactive and engaging for everyone.\"", "\"They've had Barbies they can dress and pose all different ways, all their lives. Now it's time for Today's Barbie -- Digital Dress Barbie, something different, something new, and so \"\"today.\"\" Lets them design her clothes with a stylus, and bright colorful dots of light, either their own creations or some that are supplied. It really is quite fascinating, complete with music. I'm all for anything that let's kids get creative. My brownie troup fought over it, ages 6-8. This was the real test, each girl anxiously awaiting her turn, and wanting one of her own. As an adult I can see it has its limitations as opposed to the original Barbie's, but then again it's not made for me, it's for them. That's how I judge my rating, the level of interest and interaction.Not your traditional Barbie, but it wasn't meant to be. Been there, done that. This will be the rage this Christmas. If your child gets one, her friends will all want their own.\"", "\"Up front, this isn't a regular Barbie doll that can be posed or have its clothing changed. You can move its arms or comb its hair, but that's where the similarity to Barbie dolls ends.However, as a mini girl-shaped Lite Brite kind of toy, it's a lot of fun. The necklace is really three buttons that allow you to draw pictures in different colors using a plastic stylus or your finger, make a scrolling marquee message (great fun at slumber parties or sports events) or choose from a variety of preprogrammed patterns such as hearts and lines that move with music or your voice. It shuts off by itself after a few minutes, and the AAA batteries, stored in her legs, have lasted well so far. Keep the enclosed instructions that tell what each button does.This really should be looked upon as a Barbie \"\"fan item\"\", like the Barbie-shaped camcorder and camera, rather than a doll itself.\"", "Let's face it - there are some Barbie dolls that are meant to be played with and some that simply aren't. the Digital Dress Doll is one of those Barbies that isn't going to find itself with new outfits driving the Barbie Beetle down the hallway. That being said - the thing is cool!! The concept is a simple one - it's an LED screen (with really tiny LED lights!!) on a dress. You can either use one of the pre-made designs or you can create your own. OR you can do my favorite thing - make it dance to the music!Watching the lights change and move with the beat was my favorite part of the whole thing, and both my daughter and I spent over an hour one day going through tons of music to see the different designs as the beat changed. And that we could make our OWN designs and have them dance to the beat - well, there went another hour!It's not a doll that you get down and dirty with - but it is a fantastically cool Barbie that will definitely be getting some serious play time, especially when her friends come over!", "\"I usually only collect \"\"collectors\"\" Barbies, but this one is just too much fun, I'm 55 and really didn't become interested in Barbies until I was in my mid 40's when I encountered my very first limited edition Barbie, all of a sudden Barbie wasn't just a blah mass producted doll anymore.The Digital Dress Barbie takes some of the really fun stuff of technology and combines it with a classic Barbie. I actually saw this doll in a store before requesting it from Vine. Myself, and my 24 year old daughter were playing with the doll's demo in the store and totally fascinated with the patterns and the overall concept of the digital dress.I would not recommend the Digital Dress Barbie for a child less than 7 years old, and even that might depend on how the child takes care of their toys, but it does have alot of replay value.\"", "This is quite user friendly. Our eight year old loves it. She and her friends spend a lot of time dressing and changing Barbie.", "This is a cute novelty toy and would probably be great for collectors. But as far as being able to play with it as a kid. It lights up, it makes some limited designs changes a few colors and does not move at all.", "I watched the girls in our family play with this Barbie and the youngest ones can't put her down. They are fascinated with Digital Dress Barbie's light displays when you play with her 3 modes of play. In the first mode, you can use the stylus or your finger to create and save your own light designs. In the second mode, you can use your finger to animate, making your finger play with the lights. In the third mode, you can use sound to animate the lights- it doesn't matter if you are singing or talking or beating a drum or playing music- the light show keeps up with your sounds.This Barbie cannot be dressed, as her dress is a permanent part of her, due to the digital lights. Her legs hold the batteries and don't bend. Her necklace cannot be removed as they are the light mode control buttons. You can still play with her hair and change her shoes, but all this really limits her playability.Just when the older girls became a bit bored with Barbie's animated light shows, and not being able to dress her or pose her much, the younger girls found Barbie is even more fun to play with after dark, when the brightly colored lights really show up. The younger girls are still creating light shows and having fun styling Barbie's hair to match, so this Digital Dress Barbie is perfect for a younger child.", "My daughter was excited to try this Barbie. She loves her gadgets and being able to program the digital dress has provided hours of entertainment. She and her friends loved the voice-activated mode and had a great time programming their names on it. But once the novelty wore off, the doll has been relegated to the bottom of the box. So it's great fun for the moment...but I don't see any long term potential. But I will say this doll held up under some pretty tough circumstances. The kids weren't easy on it and it was very sturdy.", "My eight year old daughter owns a lot of Barbie and Monster High toys and this is by far the absolute best. I love the opportunities for creative thinking and how simple it is to implement the ideas thanks to the well thought out interface. This would be perfect to give a child before a long road trip as it will surely give them hours of entertainment. It isn't that cheap kind of entertainment that looks flashy on the box but disappointments when opening, either. It is the kind of fun that draws you in and allows for open ended play. You can select letters to create a scrolling marquee message on the doll in many colors. You can draw pictures. You can have the lines dance to the beat. You can play fashion designer and create patterns on her dress. The possibilities are endless and appeal to younger or older girls.My only complaint is not unique to this product. I desperately wish they would make the clothing slightly more modest. Seriously, a pair of leggings would go a long way toward making this outfit acceptable.Please note the electronic components of the screen are in the doll itself and that the dress overlays it."], "Gamma": [0.07681048661470413, 0.10692628473043442, 0.16494587063789368, 0.08995296061038971, 0.24672231078147888, 0.15045581758022308, 0.16418617963790894], "Beta": [[0.06384281069040298, 0.06580301374197006, 0.0655883252620697, 0.06636054068803787, 0.06547515839338303, 0.06630063056945801, 0.06691989302635193, 0.06996344029903412, 0.06747647374868393, 0.06932327151298523, 0.06581686437129974, 0.06575248390436172, 0.06935074180364609, 0.06586423516273499, 0.0661621168255806], [0.060212865471839905, 0.06280231475830078, 0.0672793835401535, 0.06685898452997208, 0.06899791955947876, 0.0647454783320427, 0.06709641218185425, 0.06652075797319412, 0.06605201959609985, 0.06881457567214966, 0.06629057228565216, 0.06687673181295395, 0.06714082509279251, 0.06865105032920837, 0.0716601312160492], [0.05585731193423271, 0.05717500299215317, 0.06782859563827515, 0.06706530600786209, 0.07001569122076035, 0.06308557093143463, 0.06711428612470627, 0.06423581391572952, 0.06776522099971771, 0.07162991911172867, 0.06575945764780045, 0.06709825247526169, 0.06856349855661392, 0.07007931172847748, 0.07672679424285889], [0.05946093052625656, 0.06608878076076508, 0.0667790025472641, 0.06680532544851303, 0.06826639920473099, 0.06544776260852814, 0.0677892416715622, 0.06782645732164383, 0.06883697956800461, 0.0658155158162117, 0.06674513220787048, 0.06696154177188873, 0.06792159378528595, 0.06712845712900162, 0.0681268498301506], [0.049938905984163284, 0.05475999042391777, 0.0672772005200386, 0.06673013418912888, 0.06859931349754333, 0.060789406299591064, 0.06856097280979156, 0.06597950309515, 0.07203114032745361, 0.07289053499698639, 0.06517888605594635, 0.06703142821788788, 0.06981451064348221, 0.07030770927667618, 0.08011043071746826], [0.05872121825814247, 0.05605875700712204, 0.06838130205869675, 0.0673721581697464, 0.07068312913179398, 0.06410744041204453, 0.06651483476161957, 0.06353364139795303, 0.0649033710360527, 0.07199686765670776, 0.06597915291786194, 0.06730300188064575, 0.0680377185344696, 0.07015947997570038, 0.0762479305267334], [0.06034263223409653, 0.05234351381659508, 0.06909073889255524, 0.06775365769863129, 0.07103440165519714, 0.06462705135345459, 0.06656742095947266, 0.06362142413854599, 0.06202161684632301, 0.07327625155448914, 0.06607891619205475, 0.06771843135356903, 0.06775421649217606, 0.07036755979061127, 0.07740218192338943]]}
