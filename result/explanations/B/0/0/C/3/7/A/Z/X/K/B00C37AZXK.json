Took over a month to receive it but it actually receives stations a lot better than the Shark and was much cheaper.  The freeware software I'm using doesn't have the best or prettiest interface but works fine.  I could and might search for other software where I can save and recall station presets but for now I'm pretty satisfied with everything.", "I bought this not for TV but for a homebrew ASDB tracking system with a homebrew antenna.  It worked out of the box, and it was OK, but the range was a bit low.  Turns out it was a loose antenna connection and once I replaced the F-Connector I was amazed at how sensitive this little guy is.  Even with 30' of RG-6 we were tracking aircraft out to over 200km.I then said &#34;I should get rid of that 6db of loss from the RG-6&#34; and so I bought a 10m USB extender cable and moved the receiver up to the antenna itself.  Now we are tracking aircraft to over 350km!  Amazing!My next project is a maritime tracker for AIS - I can't wait!", "Recd. item and to my dismay the seller ad was misleading, shows 3 pics /items,  only recd. the usb stick, antenna  (guts of OEM package) No software or cleaning cloth as shown in ad!!!!!Seller says &#34;Ohh software doesn't work in US&#34;.. nice to know before hand ?!?!Does not receive worth a darn, if at all, no matter which SDR software used and/or various antennas..As an Amateur Radio Extra Class operate, I know how to setup items and which antennas to use........this thing is deaf regardless of setups.", "This is the third European TV dongle receiver I've purchased for use as a software defined radio and it works as well as the other versions. It's difference in comparison to the others are relatively minor, such as slightly different frequency range.I didn't use the included software instead going straight to SDRsharp and the drivers needed by that program.The supplied antenna is as bad as the one supplied with other versions of these TV dongles and for any serious listening, especially outside the TV Band you will need an adapter and better antennas.Once you have an adapter that fits the XM style antanna plug port be careful not to let it carry any load, as this could damage the port.", "SDR works great, only issue I've had was getting the various software to work it, but once you do, it's well worth the headache.", "This is my 2nd USB receiver.  The included software is not needed and does not work properly in the US.  Do a Google search on SDR and you will find all the info you need.  There is much free software to operate these USB receivers.  The frequency range is around 24 to 1850 MHz with no gaps.  With up-converters you can even pick up the AM and shortwave bands.  I'm also using this to track commercial aircraft within a hundred mile radius of the antenna.  The antenna that comes with this is ideal for this purpose but you might want several antennas for applications on the lower end of the spectrum.", "\"I got the cheap version, not the \"\"brand name\"\" - as my research showed that actually they are the same product made by the same manufacturer at the same plant with the same components. So why to pay extra? There is no need to use any of the software provided on the mini cd, not even the device drivers. Simply download the installation script kit (sdr-install.zip) from sdrsharp's website (sdrsharp.com), unzip it in a folder and run the batch file which in turn downloads the Zadig USB drivers, the RTLSDR library, and the sdrsharp application. (If you are using windows xp, download also zadig_xp_v2.0.1.160.7z instead of zadig_v2.0.1.160.7z downloaded by the install script)The batch script then unpacks everything in a folder. That's the extent of the installation; so this is a \"\"portable\"\" install, not a classic windows install which modifies the registry. If you ever want to remove it you simply delete the folder. At that point you need to connect your device to an usb port on your computer and run zadig in order to get the proper device driver initialized. There is a step by step tutorial at the site where you downloaded the software. This is a one time task. Then you run sdrsharp, part of which basically looks like a software radio panel (the rest is more of a spectrum analyzer with frequency monitor and waterfall). You can quickly tune in some FM stations and verify that everything is working fine. Obviously, you've got to connect the small antenna supplied in the package. The itsy-bitsy antenna works surprisingly well. As for accuracy, I was lucky enough that my device is dead-on accurate with no frequency drift of any kind. Using a better antenna will certainly improve sensitivity and selectivity, but the beginning package is perfect for the money.Quick end note: It is said that you can download the usb driver, the rtlsdr library and sdr sharp manually. But when you do so, there are always a few missing dlls which make the device either not recognized by windows or crash on start up. So, the install script is the best way to make things work.\"", "picked up this little bugger to experiment with software defined radio. With a free program available on the interwebbs, you can listen in on you neighbors just like the NSA. Or you could just use it as a very cheep police scanner.", "I've been using this for the past few weeks to listen to VHF/UHF commercial communications, VHF Air Band and the 1090MHz ADS-B info used by air traffic control. I didn't expect much since there were no filters or pre-amp on the front end, but each iteration of my listening set-up has brought in weaker and weaker signals. Getting the unit in to it's own metal box and shielding the incoming USB cable cut out a lot of the computer noise, then putting a BNC antenna connector on the back let me connect the unit to a radioshack dis-cone antenna for even better sensitivity. ADB# and GQRX are both excellent free programs that work well with this unit. I'm using a cf-29 toughbook computer with windows XP... the audio was spotty at first, but then I added a USB 2.0 PCMCIA card and with the dongle plugged in there, the audio is great!Anyway, if you want to play with Software Defined Radio, you can't go wrong with this jewel.", "I am using this with SDR Sharp software and it works great.", "Got the cheaper version of the RTL-SDR (DVB-T DAB+FM for $10).  Hours of learnings for $10 can't go wrong.Heard commercial FM, ADS-B aircraft 1090MHz, and my handheld. Of course it does not have a xmtr function.Quick summary:The dongle receives signals with its A/D converter (RTL2832U) and its tuner (R820T). The dongle passes the digital data to the RS-232 port V2.0 where computer software is used to provide normal radio functions.My reception of ham repeaters was poor. Heard signals on my handheld but not on the SDR#. Strange because the 1090MHz reception worked fine but the 144/440MHz didn't. Will try outdoor antenna and the more expensive RTL-SDR dongle to see if that makes a difference.  Basic SDR# does not have scanner. Programmable memory channel is provided.Here's how to make it work:I first tried installing SDR software on an old Windows XP machine. Too many problems; required older .NET Framework and RS-232 v1.0  ports were too slow to capture data. After about 4 hours I gave up on the XP and went to Windows 7 machine.Installed on Windows 7.0 went well:1. install driver first (Zadig.exe, from www.zadig.akeo.ie)2. download and unzip www.SDRsharp.com/downloads/SDRinstall.zip  (this contains the SDR# and ADS-B applications)3. For ADS-B aircraft usage need the RTL-SDR driver (Zadig), the ADS-B decoder (ADS-B app) AND a display application (like Virtual Radar or ADSBScope)  See the excellent guide: http://rtl-sdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ADSBSharpQuickStart.pdf4. For general purpose 30MHz to &#62;1GHZ reception there is a good ref at: http://rtlsdr.org/softwarewindows.a. Install the Zadig driver, if not installed.b. Install the SDRSharp appHelpful hints:A. To test if the RTL-SDR dongle and ADSB is decoding aircraft data use the Telnet application. Telnet has to be loaded into by: Windows 7 ControlPanel&#62;Program&#62;WindowsFeatures&#62; and check Telnet clientB. Convert the MCX connections to something useful. I converted MCX to SMA for use with my 2m whip.C. Add extension SMA cable moved 2m whip out the window.D. I got a lot of spurious signals because of computer noise. Separate RTL-SDR dongle from computer (RS-232 extension cable)E. Identify modes on the waterfall with this helpful video http://hfradio.org.uk/html/digital_modes.htmlF. ADSB aircraft data doesn't report all flight numbers, equipment, and route info. Virtual Radar allows user to update route info and share with web users. But plane position was more up-to-date then flight tracker or Flight Aware.Bottom line - so much fun for $10 has to be illegal. Next step to try plug-ins to SDR# for digital modes and try to improve repeater reception.73s", "I purchased two of these for use as SDR's as well as the NooElec version and can see no difference between them.  NooElec probably does have better support and they do guarantee that their dongles have the ESD protection diodes, which is not always a given with these.  I popped all of mine open to check them out and they're all identical, ESD diodes and all, so these represent an excellent value. I'm currently using these for ADS-B, ACARS, as well as general scanning and I'm very happy with the performance of them so far.  I can see myself getting some more of these dongles and more purpose built antennas and trying some more interesting stuff with them.  The stock antennas work well enough for ADS-B and higher freq UHF but you'll want to upgrade them for most anything else.  Really fun gadgets to play with.", "This is a great SDR Dongle for the price. Was able to get it working in no time with very little prep work.The setup/use is the same as any RTL2832 device.The big flaw is that the Attennae is pretty much useless and if you want to do anything with this dongle you will need to replace it with a real/better one, or you will just be listening to a bunch of static.", "\"Of course don't expect OTA TV reception here in the USA, it's not the right continent for this one. I think it works better than some of the other \"\"stubby\"\" models... hard to prove though.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0006561811896972358, 0.016347557306289673, 0.001244058832526207, 0.0006777574308216572, 0.013787651434540749, 0.0011113900691270828, 0.0972282737493515, 0.23697584867477417, 0.022392580285668373, 0.24295850098133087, 0.022940024733543396, 0.004605103749781847, 0.2517804801464081, 0.08729459345340729]]}
