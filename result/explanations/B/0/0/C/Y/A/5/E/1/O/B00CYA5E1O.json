"], "reviews": ["I've been using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning spin brush for almost a year and I feel pleased with the difference that's it's made in the appearance of my skin. Naturally I jumped at the opportunity to try this Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion kit and it does not disappoint! To give you a little background, I'm 38 years old with very sensitive, fair skin that reacts to most anti- aging skin care products and I'm prone to monthly hormonal breakouts. I have oilier skin during the warmer months and dry, flaky skin during the winter. Although I've had success with the Olay Advanced Cleaning brush, I initially felt a little hesitation to use the microdermabrasion head and accompanying thermal crystal cleanser. I'm thrilled to report that my initial worries were unfounded. My sensitive skin didn't have any reactions or breakouts. As per the directions (found on the side of the box, not inside), I use the renewal cleansing brush with the exfoliating cleanser everyday and I use the microdermabrasion head with the thermal crystal cleanser twice a week with three days in between uses. After almost a month, my skin looks incredible! It looks smooth and fresh and it feels baby soft. I REALLY love this system! It's effective, yet gentle enough for my sensitive skin and it's affordable. Obviously everybody has different skin types and will react differently to products, but I feel good about recommending this system to people with normal skin or skin that is similar to my own that I've described above.", "This is a bit small if you ask me, probably good for occasional use like, when traveling but the cleasing brush and the buffer pad are so small that you have to use it much longer to cover more surface area. Unlike a Clairsonic which has a larger brush and also has a timer, a nice plus. After using this, my skin feels smooth but the feeling doesn't last. It's just okay but I wouldn't say it's revolutionary. Also, on high speed, the brush and pad rotate wildly on the pin, making it difficult to use properly.", "I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The brush and sponge heads are so soft I wasn't really expecting much,  and the polishing pearls are small and gentle, but it works great. After just one use my skin was softer and smoother. I already signed up for the auto delivery of the refills. It says not to use more than two days a week, but my skin was so bad I think I'm going to start with three days,  Mon, Wed and Fri. Well worth the money.", "This is a nice tool for keeping facial skin clean and smooth.  My wife uses both the brush and the pad and both of the enclosed products.  She says her skin feels cleaner and much smoother after using them than before she started using this kit.  She also tried the rotating brush with St. Ives Apricot Scrub and liked the results.We also own a 2-speed Olay rotating brush, and I am not sure that the addition of the 3rd speed on this model offers much benefit.  The only downside in her opinion is that the enclosed cleanser and polisher tubes are very small - less than 1 oz each.", "I wouldn't say this product is as effective as a professional microdermabrasion session but for home use, this is easy to use and costs a lot less than paying for a professional treatment.That said, I found this kit super easy to use and since the tubes of product are not that large I used small amounts and only once or twice a week to keep from drying out my skin.The effects of this Pro-X system are reduced pores and cleaner and healthier skin. The product hasn't dried out my skin and I do like the polisher. The kit comes with a nice brush that really scrubs the skin without being abrasive and the polisher has a nice effect.If you want an easy to use microdermabrasion kit that you can use at home and not have to spend a lot of money, this kit may not be as good as a professional treatment but it does help.", "Since I popped $150+ for a Clarasonic and go to a local spa for deep cleansing treatments every 4 to 6 week, I figured I'd go with it when Vine offered this system. The worst possible outcome would have been that it didn't work.Since I was due for a deep cleansing last week, I used this instead following the instructions as specified using the slightly gritty cleanser at a high speed to remove dirt and dry skin buildup.I probably was a little to enthusiastic because my skin was a little on the red side after I was finished. I massaged a little aloe vera into my skin and the redness quickly dissipated. What was left was soft, fresh skin that was clean and looked brighter and fresher. I experienced no allergic reaction and was very pleased with the results which were as good as my results after my spa visits.I have been blessed with good genes and am not particularly wrinkled and I have a nice completion, but this product is great if you are in maintenance mode. Based on my experience this product is definitely worth a try.", "I was really hoping this would be awesome, cost efficient and amazing for my skin.I broke out.  At first I assumed this was because I had such an awesome deep clean, I'd get a little a be and then I would use it again and the acne would eventually fade off my face and break outs would stop.  This is not what happened.  I broke out directly in my T zone.  From my forehead all down my nose and chin.  I had more dirt not less in my pores.My hopes were extremely high.  I love the idea of microdermabrasion and I was hoping to find an amazing product at an affordable price.  I have very large pores.  I normally don't get acne, but I do get blackheads and whiteheads.", "\"I've had my eye on this type of product for quite some time, as I keep seeing mentions in women's magazines and other places.  I was pretty eager to try it.The unit comes with two \"\"heads\"\"--a smooth one for microdermabrasion, and a brush for regular cleaning--plus two sample-sized (tiny) tubes of cleanser and scrub.I decided to try the microdermabrasion first.  I was puzzled as to how a smooth foam pad could do anything, until I opened the tube of cream.  Yowza.  Sandpaper in a bottle.  I've never used a scrub that was that harsh before. I proceeded very, very gently.  Afterwards, my face did feel smoother, but the next morning it wasn't, plus my face was very, very dry.  I have oily skin and the dryness persisted for days.  I might use the scrub on my feet, but never on my face again.The brush for cleaning your skin--what can I say?  No different than using a washcloth.  I've used it for weeks now just to give it a fair shot and my skin is exactly the same.I'm pretty disappointed with this.  It does absolutely nothing and I don't recommend it.\"", "I've only had this product a few weeks so I don't think i've seen all of the benefits yet, but so far, so good.  It is easy to use, the fragrance is lovely, it isn't harsh on my fairly sensitive skin, and it doesn't take very long to use.  I'm looking forward to seeing just how improved my skin will be after a few more weeks of use.  I've had professional microdermabrasion done a few times and loved it, but it is really expensive and time consuming to go to the doctor's office.  Olay's option is far more reasonable with regard to both time and cost.  I recommend the microdermabrasion plus kit.", "I've used this, off and on, for a few weeks.  My skin is definitely softer!  I think my skin looks brighter, but I never saw any reduction in fine lines or anything.  The best thing about this product is that my skin feels very clean after I use it.  I think it's versatile enough to use with other cleansers after I've finished using the cleanser/exfoliant that came with it.  It's a keeper.", "First of all, the product comes with inadequate instructions.  The package comes with a cleansing product which has some abrasive grit in it, an abrasion only product, sponge attachment, brush attachment, and batteries.  The instructions say (in many languages) how to put the batteries in, and which product to use with which attachment.  It does not say whether to keep the brush and sponge wet, how often to use the products, or any warnings about the problems which I will now describe.Other similar devices that I have tried have a back and forth agitating movement.  This one has a three speed rotary action.  If you leave even a tiny whisp of hair loose, it can wind clear up to your scalp before you are able to turn the thing off. This is not a theoretical risk.If you decide to use this, make sure you have all your hair secured as if you were scrubbing in to surgery.  If you do get it caught, don't panic. Just switch off the device, remove the attachment, and you can get your hair detatched from the attachment quite easily,  You might even  be able to get it untangled. I only had to cut a very little bit out because of the knotted twisting.Second, and this is more serious, you have to keep the sponge attachment sopping wet.  If you do not, either the motor will not turn  if you are holding it firmly to your skin, or if you press more lightly it grabs the skin intermittently and skips around.  Even if you soak the sponge, it dries out enough without warning to jump unpredictably.  It actually hit me in the open eye twice before I quit trying new strategies.  I didn't sustain a corneal injury it could easily have caused a serious injury.I gave it two stars because the products included are actually quite nice.  Just massage around gently with your finger tips.  I have tried to think up what else I might be able to use the machine for but have concluded I might as well just throw it away.", "\"This kit comes with a battery (included) operated device that has a spinning peg.  It also has a brush head and a foam head, a tube of cleanser, and a tube of microdermabrasion paste.The labeling is not clear, and instructions are almost non-existent.  You're to attach the appropriate head to the unit, the brush for cleansing or the foam pad for abrading, then moisten your face, apply the appropriate product and have at it.  OK, well, how much product am I supposed to use?  The tubes are the same size, but you're supposed to, if you choose, use the cleanser daily, and the microdermabasion once a week.  So does that mean you use seven times as much of the microdermabrasion paste as cleanser?Actually, it didn't matter in the end.  I didn't like either \"\"tube\"\" product.  Each dried rapidly on my face, even though I splashed it good with water beforehand.  I always splash my face with water before I start any sort of cleansing.  I rinsed off the cleanser and applied my usual lightly foaming cleanser.That I liked.  The brush head has very soft bristles, and my skin was very clean and my skin felt fabulous.The foam head, for microdermabrasion, is very like a good, firm makeup sponge.  Since the product dried on my face, I tried it on knees, elbows and the backs of my hands.  There was a tiny bit of dead skin removal, which is appropriate.  However, the skin on my knees turned beet red for a while.It's fourth down, and Olay is going to have to punt.  My advice is skip this, and use a BHA, AHA, or PHA product to exfoliate.  This thing is just a waste of time.\"", "My skin is extremely dry due to a chronic illness.  I use the old Olay brush and it did a good job cleaning but I definitely needed something that would be more aggressive in treatment of dry skin.  I had treated myself to a couple of salon facials but they were expensive and the effects were great but only temporary.  I needed something that I could more frequently and cost effective.  I think I have found it.  The new Olay system has a third faster speed that combines with a soft spongy pad to give you a microdermabrasion treatment.  Using it twice a week my dry skin has really improved and I am very pleased with the results.  Do I need any more salon spa facials?  No, but don't tell my husband.", "\"I exfoliate a couple times a week with a salicylic scrub so I wasn't blown away with the exfoliating power of this system.  What I do really like about this system is the cleansing brush & how good it makes my skin feel; I've been using the cleansing brush once a day for 10 days now & I like how clean and clear it makes my skin.  Sometimes I use the included cleanser but I most often use my regular facial cleanser.  The brush is soft enough that it does not irritate my skin but gives me a good scrub/massage.I have used the microdermabrasion  foam head and polisher scrub 3 times now.  It does exfoliate \"\"deeper\"\" than my usual scrub but not dramatically.  I'll keep using it but I don't think I will replace the head and polisher when it runs out.I like the ability to change speeds.  It feels good to use the brush at a slow speed to massage my face; very relaxing.  I like the higher speed to quickly clean my skin.In the end, I will continue to use the cleansing brush with the \"\"Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser\"\" a few times a week & the cleansing brush with my normal facial cleanser all other days.  The \"\"Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser\"\" has crystals in it so it does a good job of exfoliating.If you own the older version of the Olay Pro-X system, the same brushes work on this new system.\"", "\"This product comes as a complete package and consists of a hand wand approximately 5 inches long, two snap in/out heads, 2 AA Duracell batteries, a tube of exfoliating cleanser, amd a tube of self-warming thermal crystal polisher.  It is compact and can easily be transported on trips.  I really like the concept of having EVERYTHING you need in this kit when you bring it home.  (How many times do you get something home and say, \"\"Oh poo!  I need XYZ-450 batteries\"\"!).  Again you get everything and it operates on easy-to-find batteries. :) The wand even shows you which way the batteries go in. (Some other companies are getting lazy with that one.)The wand has 3 speeds: one for gentle cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), one for deep cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), and one for microdermabrasion (with microdermabraision foam head).  If you are looking at the package, the microdermabraision head is the smooth one.The package claims:-- \"\"after 1 microdermabraision use, see noticeable improvement in the appearance of fine lines, radiance, brightness, and pores.-- after 2 microdermabraision uses, visibly improved texture and more even skin tone.-- after 5 days of system use, over 90% of women noticed silkier, smoother-feeling skin, and a visible improvement in dullness and overall appearance of skin.\"\"  The package also promises satisfaction or refund, with receipt and within 60 days of purchase.  I believe I saw immediate results the morning after my first microdermabrasion treatment.The manufacturer recommends limiting microdermabrasion treatments to two per week and on non-consecutive days. The in-between days, you use the face wash and the face wash brush. Of course, this product is not to be used on the delicate skin around your eyes.There are several brands of Microdermabrasion cleansing kits out there, Olay is easy to find.  If you need replacement brush or polishing heads, you should be able to find them easily.  AA batteries are a plus, too.  For the skin cleanser or scrub cream, again, Olay products are everywhere.  If you want to use another facial cleanser or scrubber, you should not have any problems there either. (I used other brands.)  I suggest you dampen the head before use and rinse it off after use, pat it dry, and set it somewhere to thoroughly dry overnight (medicine cabinet or wherever).  I also suggest you remove the head while wetting and rinsing it off.The only thing I would like to see added would be a small, cloth, zippered fabric bag/case, about 6 inches long, with \"\"Olay\"\" on it (Hint to manufacturer), that would keep everything together.  (Of course, you could also use one of those free makeup bags you get from cosmetics companies, BUT I would think Olay would want to take this opportunity to advertise their product.  It would probably only cost them about 50 cents more.)\"", "\"Prior to getting this kit, I had an earlier version of the same basic product, which came with a two-speed version of the microdermabrasion tool, with the brush head and a full size tube of the exfoliating cleanser. I left the tool in my shower, and can confirm that it does well getting soaked in water every day, the batteries last a long time, and the tool is durable and reliable.I liked the brush and the cleanser, though it wasn't super-scrubby, like an \"\"exfoliator\"\" is, in my experience. Still, it cleaned well. My skin felt smooth and pleasant.New in this kit, is a *three* speed tool, with a foam pad and the \"\"Thermal Crystal Polisher.\"\" Both the cleanser and the polisher come in small tubes.I'm not entirely thrilled with the polisher and the foam pad, though I can't tell if I'm just not using it right, or I expected something else. The substance is very thick and gummy, with fine, gritty particles. When used in combination with the foam pad, I feel a lot of drag on my skin, and it feels like it gets hot. I assume this is the \"\"thermal\"\" part, but... it kind of feels like heat just from friction, because it's dragging so much. And my skin doesn't seem noticeably smoother than when I just used the exfoliating cleanser and the brush.So, ultimately: it's a nice tool. It works well. I like the exfoliating cleanser and the brush. But the pad/polisher combo doesn't seem as nice. You might considerOlay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Countinstead, as it's a little cheaper. But you won't go wrong with this. :)\"", "I've had a Clarisonic Mia for about three years, but wanted to try out this new Olay system since I was intrigued by the idea of the microdermabrasion head.  This is a quality product, and it's a great value for those looking for something comparable to the Clarisonic, but at a better price range.The brush comes with:*  two Duracell batteries (which I really like, since you don't have to worry about re-charging it)*  two brush heads (one for regular cleaning and one that is a buffing pad for microdermabrasion)*  two different cleansers (one for each brush head)The brush itself also has three speeds, and you change the speeds by pushing on buttons, which are very easy to use:*  Speed 1 is the Daily Gentle Cleansing Speed that is meant to be used with the regular brush head*  Speed 2 is the Daily Deep Cleansing Speed that that is meant to be used with the regular brush head; it supposedly cleans 600% better than regular cleansing*  Speed 3 is the Microdermabrasion Speed that is meant to be used with the Microdermabrasion Foam Head; it supposedly exfoliates 700% better than their scrub alone.The brush head itself also rotates, which it doesn't do on the Clarisonic Mia.  According to the packaging, the brush heads are interchangeable with the other Pro-X brush heads in this line.As another reviewer mentioned, the frustrating thing is that the kit doesn't come with a complete set of instructions; except for a brief brochure that tells you how to put the batteries in, everything is printed on the exterior of the box, and it's actually a bit confusing to read since the information is scattered in various places.  It would have been nice to have had a pamphlet that spelled things out more clearly, especially since I plan on throwing the box away.Essentially, Olay recommends that you use the regular cleanser with the brush heads each day, but the microdermabrasion pad and cleanser only twice a week, on non-consecutive days.  When you use the microdermabrasion pad, it really tugs and sucks at your skin, so don't be alarmed by this.You can also use this without Olay's cleansers and it'll work just fine.The brush head for regular cleansing is definitely not as soft and plush as the brush heads are on my Clarisonic Mia, but it didn't feel too abrasive on my sensitive skin, which can flare up really badly if I use something too harsh on it.I have sensitive skin, and was a bit apprehensive about using the microdermabrasion part, but I did so yesterday and really liked how soft and smooth my skin felt afterwards.  My face was a bit red when I finished, but some soothing lotion helped calm it back down, and I was left with a nice healthy glow.  I also liked how it removed the skin flakes that I get from my nightly use of Retin-A.Before I bought my Clarisonic Mia, I had bought this Pretika brush:Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush.  This Olay brush is much better than the Pretika, and seems like it will last much longer.Also, here are the ingredients for the Thermal Crystal Polisher:PEG 8, Sodium Bicarbonate, Silica Silylate, Polysorbate 20.The ingredients for the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser are:Water/Eau, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Polyethylene, Sorbitol, Acrylates Copolymer, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, PEG-100, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone. Thermal Crystal Polisher Ingredients: PEG-8, Sodium Bicarbonate, Silica Silylate, Polysorbate 20.Overall, this is a great system for the price, and it seems like it'll hold up nicely.  If you're looking for a facial cleansing system, this is a nice one to get, especially since it comes with the microdermabrasion buffer, too!", "The Olay Microdermabrasion system is pretty much an improved version of their original Pro X facial brush.What's different? Well, for starters, this brush has 3 settings as opposed to the 2 on the original. The third setting is faster and intended for the deeper cleaning with a microdermabrasion scrub.It also not only comes with the standard brush head, but a soft, sponge head for using the microbrasion setting.It should be noted that you can still use the regular Pro X brush heads with this, which is great if you have some  brush heads on hand already.You get everything you need to start off in this kit, including batteries (which I love) . You get a small cleanser and a small microdermabrasion scrub. It is important to know you can use this system with ANY cleanser or scrub. Olay wants you to buy their brand of course, but it is not necessary to get the desired results. I recommend you use the lower setting for daily use with your cleanser and the higher setting 1-2 times a week with an exfoliatant. When using an exfoliant, you will want to wash off any residue left from microbeads or grains the use in the product to avoid it clogging your pores.As I stated when I reviewed the original Pro X skin care brush, this is just as effective on skin as the higher priced brands. Save money and buy this!The lowdown is you get a great effective facial cleansing brush that is good for everyday cleansing and also deeper scrubbing, at a fraction of the cost of higher brands.", "This is a cleaning system that comes with 2 brush heads and two sample sizes of Olay's cleansers.  You get one brush head for regular cleaning and one foam head for deep exfoliating.  There are two samples of the cleansers that comes with this.  One is a daily use cleaner with a bead like exfoliating agent that is designed to be used with the brush head.  The other is a thermal crystal (they heat up on contact with the skin) exfoliating cleanser that is designed to be used with the foam head.  You can also use regular facial soap with the brush.  The system has three speeds and comes with batteries.Overall, I really like the system.  After a few days of using this, I told my husband I thought my skin looked better and he agreed with me!  Since my husband is one of the world's most honest men, if he didn't agree with this, he would have said something noncommittal to skirt the issue.  So I had to believe it wasn't just my wishful thinking.So far, I have been using this a month and I am pretty happy with the product.  The one thing this product could use is better instructions for when you use this the first time.  I would recommend starting with a slow speed and increasing the intensity as your skin adjusts.  I will probably not get thier daily cleanser but I will buy more of the exfoliating cleanser. Good product, recommend.", "\"An effective battery-operated skin cleansing tool with a spinning brush and foam pad. It has 3 speeds for: Cleansing, Deep Cleansing and Microdermabrasion.This kit comes with the cleansing tool, snap on brush, foam pad, batteries, samples of the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and Thermal Crystal Polisher. For me the real magic is the thermal crystals + foam pad + the additional microdermabrasion speed. Don't get me wrong the brush at the lower speeds with the exfoliating renewal cleanser delivers a good cleansing and gentle exfoliation that can be used daily very much like Olay's original cleansing system. However used at microdermabrasion speed, the crystals with the foam pad are AWESOME. So much so they are only recommended TWICE a week with at least a day in between to avoid irritation from \"\"too much of a good thing\"\". The results are nearly as good as an in-office microdermabrasion.You can look forward to brighter, smoother, pore-minimized skin after your first two microdermabrasion treatments. It does deep clean, smooth and exfoliate nicely and preps your skin for your favorite serums and moisturizers with immediate absorption and results.This new entry to the Olay family is an upgrade AND improvement to the Olay Pro-X AND DDF version of the skin tool with it's microdermabrasion 3rd speed. The others are 2-speed and are documented to deliver 400% better exfoliation compared to this 3-speed one which says 700% better exfoliation. The Olay crystals have more grit than the DDF formulated cyrstals. The brush and foam pad are interchangeable across the three different tools. So when you upgrade you don't lose your investment in the other tool and accessories. I plan on using my original for travel and the Microdermabrasion + for home.Although the Microdermabrasion + is more expensive than the original Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, it is cheaper than DDF usually sold @ dermatologist offices or stores.  Another positive with this new entry is the refill IS AVAILABLE and cheaper than the hard to find DDF refills.EVEN IF you already have the original Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System it is worth getting the Microdermabrasion Refill Kit for the foam pad and the crystals for twice weekly special treatments. I've used the DDF Refills for at least a year on my original Olay cleansing system. You will see improvements in the interim before you decide to upgrade to the 3-speed Microdermabrasion Kit. I'm betting you'll upgrade sooner OR later!PS I have a Clarisonic, which doesn't spin and cleans well. I like the Microdermabrasion + BETTER for it's effectiveness and relatively economical cost for purchase and ongoing use.***Microdermabasion + has a smaller brush head than the Clarisonic BUT the foam pad is larger than the microbrasion tool at the dermatologist's office too. The nurse goes across each area THREE times as though you're making an asterisk design on your skin. Hope this helps :)\"", "\"UPDATE 9/17/2013: I called Olay, as requested by Olay Comm Mgr.  I do have to say that I'm impressed with Olay's Customer Service.  The CS rep to whom I spoke said that this probably isn't the best product for someone with sensitive skin, as I have.  I hadn't considered that this might be related to my ultra sensitive skin, as the reaction from this (acne) was different than the reaction I usually get from skin products (ultra itchy rash, which this didn't cause at all).  The rep also said that I shouldn't press down with the brush -- at all -- as it's best to let the cleansing and exfoliating product do the job, rather than the brush.  I was also impressed that the rep will be sharing my experience within the Olay company.  I thought it was great that they take one customer's experience so seriously.  For Olay's great Customer Service, I'd give five star, and one star because of the experience I had, for a combined rating of three stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW: There were so many things I hate about this cleansing system.  For starters, it doesn't feel like it cleans my skin as much as it pulls, stretches and twists my skin while the brush or sponge is spinning around.  Maybe it's because, in my older age (50+) my skin is not tight and firm as it used to be, but stretching my skin like that can't be good for the wrinkles that are already there.  My wrinkles don't need any help to get deeper and more noticeable than they already are!Then, after a couple days, I noticed that I started getting acne.  Horrible acne that took a week to go away after I stopped using this \"\"advanced\"\" cleansing system.I can't recommend this for the above reasons.\"", "\"I've wanted one of these microdermabrasion kits for a couple of years but never could convince myself to drop the $30-$40 for them.  So I was thrilled to get to try out the Olay Pro-X Cleaning System.The box doesn't really have any directions as to what to do other than to get your face wet, put the cleanser on one of the brushes and start spinning it on your face.  With a little puzzle solving, I came to the conclusion that the brush head, the one with the bristles, is meant to be used for cleaning your face.  I guess the speed you choose is up to you.  Then that leaves the flat sponge type head to put the polisher on, sort of like a light sandpaper.  Again, you spin it on your desired speed all over your face.  This is what I came up with, I could be completely wrong but as I said, there weren't any instructions in my package.  I'm not sure how often you should be doing this, how long for each time, what results I'm actually supposed to see and how soon, etc.  All of that lack of information has sort of made me feel like I'm just washing my face with a spinning tooth brush and some type of soap.  I haven't noticed any changes in my skin but maybe I'm not using it enough?  My skin does feel really soft after I use it and I don't have any lingering breakouts, redness or rashes.  It is relaxing to have the brush sort of lightly massage your face and I suppose after you run out of the included cleansing creams you could just use anything you like.I'm not sure if all microdermabrasion kits are like this or if it's just assumed that the person who buys one will have had it done in a salon at some point and will already know what to do, but I'm the type of person who like clear and concise direction so I know what the end goal is and I didn't get that with this kit.So I put it in my \"\"weird beauty gadgets\"\" box - not a fail but not something I'll use on a routine basis either.\"", "\"This kit comes with a cleansing/application tool, two application heads and two tubes of product. The cleansing tool is powered by two AAA batteries, which are included. The application heads are a cleansing head and a foam buffer thing. The design of the tool is modeled after the Clairsonic, but it does not work like the Clairsonic; on the Olay model the application heads spin, whereas the Clairsonic vibrates at a high frequency. The included products are a daily exfoliating cleanser and a microdermabrasion cream for use twice weekly.I replaced my regular cleanser (Dudu Osun Black Soap) with the daily cleanser for a few days to test it out. I kept the rest of my cleansing routine the same. On the plus side, the cleanser did not cause me to have any break outs or rashes, which has not always been the case with Olay Pro-X products. On the down side, my skin's oil production went completely out of control. My face looked and felt greasy all the time. I never have this problem with my regular cleanser.The microdermabsion cream is similar to the Olay Regenerist microdermabrasion system, but it is an all in one product and is not quite as strong. It does an okay job of exfoliating, but nothing really impressive. The Regenerist kit is much better, imo.As for the hand tool, I prefer the Clairsonic. I realize that it isn't really fair to compare them, since the Clairsonic is several hundred dollars and has years of improvements behind it, but I think if Olay is going to design something that looks so much like the Clairsonic, they have to expect comparisons. I always wondered if the Clairsonic would work better if the heads spun, and now I know; the answer is \"\"no.\"\" The spinning head doesn't seem to provide any more benefit than scrubbing with my fingers. In fact, my fingers do a better job. The head stops if you apply very much pressure. Also, if I am in an area that is near my hairline, the spinning head rips hairs out.So, my overall take on this is: The microdermabrasion cream is okay, but the Regenerist is better and that is where I would spend my money. The hand tool doesn't add much value at all and the cleanser was a total failure.\"", "I'm not totally clueless when it comes to caring for my skin but I am wondering why detailed instructions for how to use this product were not included in the box or on the box. Sure there is a little bit of instruction for how to use the cleanser but nothing about how long to spend using the microdermabrasion scrub.I would also not use this more than once a week even though they say you can use it twice a week. The cleanser did not really foam up so that was a little disappointing. And it didn't seem like a deep clean to me even with the brush.However, the Thermal Crystals seemed to work fairly well and I used it all over my face avoiding the eye areas. The sponge head pulls the skin a bit so don't be alarmed. I felt the scrub exfoliated well even after just one use. I went to clean the scrub crystals off my face with a washcloth but that was a bad idea. It was too scratchy and didn't remove the crystals. So you have to splash water on your face which ruins your hair.I'd say this might be best used before you jump in the shower. Also I didn't use the sponge with the crystals very long. Just once over your whole face seems to be fine. So maybe it took less than a minute to use.One thing I did notice was that my skin was very dry after using the scrub. You may have to use three times the moisturizer you regularly use to combat this problem. No wonders they massage so much cream into your face at the spa. I thought it was excessive but now I see their point.So if you are looking for a cheap way to exfoliate at home this is a good option. I just would not buy the cleanser again.~The Rebecca Review", "there are three speeds for this application, and the slowest speed was a little too slow for me!  but would be useful for those delicate or sensitive areas.  The high speed is not that abrasive either.  This is not a high end model, but is suffice to allow you to get a thorough clean as part of your cleansing routine.  The soap and creame that come with the applicator were fine, but i used a gentle face soap with mine and it workwed just as well! Good value for the price.", "I wasn't sure if I would like this, I figured it either wouldn't be strong enough to notice or it would rip my skin off. Neither is true - it is just right. The brush has 3 speeds, 2 for daily cleaning and 1 for deep microdermabrasion. The first speed doesn't do much for me, I like the second with the brush and cleanser for daily use. I have tender skin, but weekly microdermabrasion at the high speed, pad and microdermabrasion crystals have left my skin really smooth and soft. Do I look younger, not really, but my skin does look healthier.", "\"This really isn't a dermabrasion kit. If you are familiar with the Pro-X cleansing kit, this is essentially the same thing, except:- There is a foam pad in the dermabrasion kit, in addition to the brush you'd also find in the cleansing kit- It operates at 3 speeds instead of 2 speedsThe dermabrasion actually comes from a \"\"thermal crystal polisher,\"\" which is a gritty gel-like material that warms on the skin. This gritty gel is coarse in my opinion, far too coarse to be used on the face. In addition, the gel and foam pad have a tendency to pull skin in delicate areas of the face. To stop the pulling, you have to add more product and/or water which results in a messy, inelegant, and poor quality cleaning.Overall, it's a thumbs down from me. However, I do use the foam pad with my own foam cleanser that I mix with fine grit dermabrasion crystals. I think that is much more effective use.\"", "This system is pretty foolproof - 2 cleaning heads and 2 cleaning products.  The head rotates instead of vibrating which I like.  After I used the microdermabrasion head and product my skin was sensitive for a day.  Didn't see much of a difference, and it seems really expensive so I might be ticked off if I'd paid full price!", "\"There is no question that this kit provides effective microdermabrasion. In fact, it abrades the skin so well that I was somewhat shocked at how potentially harsh it was. If you use a dermatologist prescribed RetinA product (I use Atralin), or if your skin is sensitive, I strongly advise you to start slowly and carefully with this product.This is basically a kit formed by combining a newly upgraded battery operated spinning brush with two different 1\"\" brush heads and two small tubes of products.The spinning brush \"\"system\"\" requires two AA batteries (included with kit) and now comes with 3 speeds: slow, medium, and faster than a speeding bullet. Slow and medium are specified for cleansing and fast is to be used when dermabrading.A nylon bristled brush head is to be used for cleansing. I found the bristles to be quite stiff although they did soften up with use. A small, 20ml \"\"starter\"\" tube ofOlay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanseris to be used with the nylon brush. This product cleanses well and provides exfoliation with \"\"micro pearls.\"\" I found that using this cleanser and brush on the slowest speed provided sufficient cleansing and was the least irritating. Experimenting with the fast speed, the brush moved wildly over the face and spattered cleanser all over the bathroom and into the eyes.I also experimented with using the brush with two of my favorite Olay cleansers: Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal Cleanser andOlay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive, both to good effect.A foam pad attachment is to be used for the microdermabrasion. With it is a tube ofOlay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing Polisher. This product warms up a bit when combined with water. The gel contains quite a bit of grit (Silica Silylate) and when used on its own (even without a spinning foam pad) would remove just about anything in its way. When applied to the foam pad and set on high speed you will certainly, without question, exfoliate!It is recommended not to use the microdermabrasion gel more than two non-consecutive days a week. For me, once a week was plenty.The use of a good moisturizer and sun screen afterward is highly recommended.I have been using the Clarisonic Mia 2 for over a year and I find it to be far less irritating than the Olay brush. Unlike the Olay brush which spins, the Clarisonic vibrates to clean and exfoliate. Even with a \"\"Deep Pore Cleansing\"\" brush attachment, the Clarisonic is effective without taking prisoners.Olay used to be a model of providing excellent consumer information along with their products. Unfortunately, this kit is a hot mess of chaotic and poorly thought out information and instructions. Everything is provided in English and French, sometimes the English is over the French, sometimes the English on the left of the French, and sometimes you are reading both languages simultaneously without comprehension of either.\"", "\"My daughter has been using this cleansing system. When she first started using it, I asked her if it cleanses better. Her reply was \"\"Oh my gosh, way better!\"\"Now after using the system for 3 weeks now, her skin is much smoother and clear of blemishes. She points out that she uses her own cleanser, not the cleanser provided by the kit.Also, my daughter told me that this kit is a good budget-friendly substitute for the more expensive Clarisonic Mia. The Olay Pro-X brush works well enough for her that she doesn't feel the need to upgrade.Highly recommended.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.029776381328701973, 0.037451475858688354, 0.0397721566259861, 0.01807093620300293, 0.03205738216638565, 0.034208811819553375, 0.0148417754098773, 0.0372166708111763, 0.03438257798552513, 0.03783666715025902, 0.03654249757528305, 0.035173796117305756, 0.03635183349251747, 0.034537192434072495, 0.023557547479867935, 0.031149396672844887, 0.03456725925207138, 0.03466220200061798, 0.03676442429423332, 0.023059312254190445, 0.03198041766881943, 0.04073968529701233, 0.0352291613817215, 0.03842257708311081, 0.03829152137041092, 0.03737998753786087, 0.03235216438770294, 0.0371304526925087, 0.031137099489569664, 0.035356681793928146]]}
