"], "reviews": ["\"Whoa, a campfire in a bag, this salt is pretty darn amazing. I never expected this salt to pack this much punch.I can't imagine ever wanting a bag bigger than 5 ounces, unless I was cooking for an army. A tiny pinch of this salt adds some amazing flavor. I love the smell of a camp fire, especially on fried chicken, gravy, or mashed potatoes. This is probably great salt for somebody trying to reduce their salt intake; it adds so much flavor in a really small amount of salt (it doesn't work for somebody eliminating salt completely).San Francisco Salt chose a perfect plastic barrier bag for this salt, there is absolutely no smoke smell before opening the bag. The zip lock is a bit difficult to close perfectly, it might be a good idea to transfer this to a glass screw cap jar (a cork is a bad idea, the smoke flavor will migrate through the cork - this is a key problem with Artisan's smoked saltAlderwood Fine Grain Smoked Gourmet Sea Salt in Glass Jar with Cork - 6.5 oz- much prettier jar, three times the cost, and loses the smoke flavor quickly). On the other hand, the plastic bag has a self standing \"\"football\"\" on the bottom of the bag (like the kind on Capri Sun juice pouches).The salt is dark like pepper. The crystals are about the size of fresh ground pepper.This is not artificial smoke; the ingredient list is strictly smoked unprocessed salt. Opening the bag for the first time, there is no question about it; there is nothing artificial about the flavor or smell.I love the smell of a campfire and smoke flavor on certain foods. This leaves a wonderful aftertaste in my mouth. A little bit of this salt goes a very long way.I was provided a sample for review.\"", "\"i've been reviewing things for Amazon for almost ten years and I now get review requests about every other day. I turn down about 99% of them but every once in a while one that is just too interesting comes along. Thus, a representative from the San Francisco Salt Company contacted me and asked if I might review several varieties of their Sea Salts. Okay, I agreed and got a couple free five-ounce packets in the mail, one of which was an Alderwood Smoked Sea Salt.I'm a geologist and I have long known that the stuff we know as table salt is the mineral Halite, which also is the chemical compound of Sodium Chloride. It occurs naturally dissolved in water, particularly sea water, or occurs as rock salt and  can be mined. Most of the mined varieties are just ancient evaporated sea water. Both of these salt sources are packaged and utilized as Table Salt, plus road salt and a host of other uses. If pure, halite will taste like halite, no matter what the source. However, on the market are conventional table salts and much more expensive \"\"Sea Salt.\"\" I was always skeptical of \"\"Sea Salt\"\" until a friend gave me a container of Mediterranean Sea Salt as a Christmas present. My, oh my, it was markedly better than my Morton table salt which I had  been using for decades. How can this be? Well, if you look on the labels of Morton, Carey or other major brands, you'll find they have other ingredients included which evidently dilute and alter the salt taste. There's things for keeping it from clotting, there's iodine for health reasons and other things depending on which brand you're looking at.  Look at your sea salt container and those things are not there. In other words, taste of the salt is not only a function of the mineral halite, but also of anything else which has been added to it. In addition, the taste of Morton (or other big brand of salt) is probably closely controlled such that a container purchased today will taste exactly like a container purchased three decades or so ago. Another factor is that pure salt water will taste differently than sea water because sea water has other naturally-occurring dissolved compounds within it. Hence, different tastes. Also, if you used many different evaporated sea waters from many different parts of the world, each would have it's own distinctive taste, not based totally on the halite but on the other dissolved impurities within it.So, what is this thing called Smoked Sea Salt? Well, I might guess that it's sea salt from the salt ponds in the south part of San Francisco Bay or something like that, plus they have found a way to  give it a rich smokey taste, perhaps in much the same way that you might smoke other foods. Well, the result is quite good. Just open the packet and you are greeted with a rich smokey aroma much like what you might find associated with a campfire using high-quality wood. Oh, it's good! Really good. I haven't been cooking so I've not tried it out in that way. However, I've added it to a variety of different foods. Just remember, that when you're using it on a food you're mixing it, a strong flavor, with the flavor of the food. Some don't mix well. Some are just exceptional. I tried it on my morning eggs, for example. Excellent!. I tried it on various mixed green salads with mixed results, all good, but none exceptional. It's really good on sliced avocado. I tried it on baked chicken. Very good, indeed! The highlight of the whole testing experience was when I tried it on a somewhat bland-tasting red potato salad. Gracious! It was just sensational! Try it out on your own. Start with a small packet to see if you like it.Gary Peterson\"", "Of the three samples of gourmet salt sent to me by the San Francisco Salt Company for reviewing this Alderwood Smoked is my favorite.  I received a free sample of fine grain Alderwood Smoked Sea Salt in a 5 ounce pouch and once I tasted it I began to look for ways to use it in recipes.  I was curious to see if the distinctive smoky flavor would come through other ingredients.  The answer is that it does on something like chicken salad, baked chicken, baked pork loin roast and egg salad, but not so definitively identifiable in something with robust flavor of its own.  I made baked chicken breasts with nothing for seasoning except olive oil, this salt and cracked pepper.  I then sliced the chicken to use to top salads and for sandwiches.  Each dish was absolutely delicious and the woodsy, smoky flavor of the salt was a shining addition.  Sliced boiled egg and cucumber slices looked very attractive with this light brown salt as a decorative aspect, but the flavor was also very prominent on the food and really good.  I will certainly be using this sample bag up and then placing an order for this tasty salt.", "\"First, I'm not an uber-foody so this review will come from a \"\"casual home cook\"\" point of view. Opening the pouch of this Alder Smoked Sea Salt instantly gives you the woody-smokey smell of good bar-b-queue. I don't think I'd use this very often in the process of cooking, but in the several dishes I've used this on it's at its best as a condiment on dishes that don't have complex flavors.First, my wife baked some swai (mild flavored southeast Asian catfish) and this really set off the dish. It tasted like it had been grilled over burning alderwood and I'm tempted to fool friends by using it that way. The flavor has no hint of artificiality with more of an infused flavor.Second, some pork loin was laying around so I nuked it in the microwave and dusted it slightly. Again, the simpler flavor of the pork was nicely enhanced. I guess if you don't like woody-smokey flavor you won't like this. She made some mashed potatoes (not a mix, regular cheapest real potatoes from the supermarket) and this salt REALLY made them tasty and interesting.Third, scrambled eggs plain: again, it made a simple dish into something much more flavorful. Use this to taste, and I recommend using it lightly.Fourth, my wife made me a complex omelet with sausage, potatoes, sweet peppers, and mushrooms. This DID NOT go well with the omelet as it tended to overpower and collide with the existing flavors.This is an easy 5 out of 5 stars for an excellent condiment for the appropriate (read: simple) dishes. Put it in one of those tiny salt bowls with a teeny-tiny salt spoon and impress your guests. Or, fire up your grill outside and secretly use this for a nifty flavor enhancing experience.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for review purposes.\"", "I had a chance to try out a small sample bag for the purpose of review, and I really like this salt. It's a very distinctive flavor, a blend of sea-salt and Kosher salt with a strong taste of alderwood smoke.It doesn't go with everything, but it goes great with some things. I added some to chicken soup and I loved it. I tried it on scrambled eggs and didn't like it as much. I didn't like it so much on zucchini or sweet potatoes either. I like it best on meats: hamburgers, chicken, fish.It's got a nice grain to it - it's a bit coarse, but dissolves smoothly in your mouth. The smoky flavor is strong - you can smell it as soon as you open the package. A little goes a long way, so be sparing at first until you get used to what you like. It's a very nice, quick way to add a distinctive flavor to some of your favorite dishes."], "Gamma": [0.24976846575737, 0.24715596437454224, 0.2516208589076996, 0.25145474076271057], "Beta": [[0.1862630844116211, 0.20418968796730042, 0.21446484327316284, 0.18208546936511993, 0.21299691498279572], [0.1872151792049408, 0.20540885627269745, 0.21713753044605255, 0.17661148309707642, 0.21362696588039398], [0.1861409693956375, 0.20352889597415924, 0.21258245408535004, 0.1857743114233017, 0.21197330951690674], [0.1855483502149582, 0.20261432230472565, 0.2137288749217987, 0.18561986088752747, 0.21248862147331238]]}
