The Jabra has got three speakers, two tweeters and a sub woofer versus only two in the Transit.2) The Solemate can be connected wired or wirelessly via Bluetooth, USB cable or 3.5 mm audio cable located in the Solemate, while the transit can only be connected either Bluetooth or wired.3) Also the Solemate can be charged either USB while connected to the USB port on the PC, versus the Transit requiring a separate charge cable and the use of the 3.5 mm audio cable, which means that the Jabra Solemate actually while connected to a PC plays digitally versus analog.4) Another difference is that the Solemate comes with a protective bag to protect it while outdoors.  Protects it from the elements (sand at the beach etc.)  It also sounds the same with the bag covering it.For the money right now Amazon is selling the JABRA Solemate for $141.21 with Free Shipping and the Transit is $249.95 with Free shipping.Also the Solemate is physically smaller.In my opinion this is simply not a good value for the money.", "This Soen speaker system is made with high quality materials with good fit and finish.  The speaker system is protected by rubber covered parts which is nice.  It can be charged via USB or a wall socket.This system is small, light weight, portable and somewhat expensive.  The system uses two speaker drivers which are vented for extra bass sound.  As with any speaker system this small the sound is somewhat limited; however, it's portability makes up for any limitations in design.What sets this system apart from the rest is it's trapezoid shape which angles up for better sound when placed on the ground.  It uses a metal stand for support.  The Transit has a nice front perforated metal cover plus a great magnetic travel cover for even more protection.", "This is a small but powerful unit that pairs effortlessly with my phone and tablets and connects directly to a PC with the supplied cable. It pairs easily via Bluetooth and set up is extremely simple. The most remarkable part of the product is the exceptional sound quality offering a solid bass and faithful sound reproduction whether you're playing classical or rock. Despite being surprisingly small, I'm frankly astonished at how good the speakers are - it's perfect for travel but will work for any averagely-sized room with reasonable acoustics.The design is very sleek and clearly made for easy setup and packing away. It even offers good battery life and doesn't seem to have any problems at all with multiple Bluetooth devices. It's a pleasure to see something so well engineered - from the moment I started using it, I immediately knew I'd be showing it off to friends and playing music all the time with this little box. It's expensive but definitely worth it for anyone enjoys high quality sound with zero complexity.", "This was quite an upgrade for me from my little $15 plug in speaker! I had been wanting a bluetooth speaker but I didn't want to spend the money on something that had mediocre sound quality just to get bluetooth. I already had mediocre with my little plug in speaker! When I had the opportunity to try out the Transit I was so excited. It literally was love at first listen. The sound is magically full and beautiful. I listened to some holiday music to get in the spirit (Trans Siberian-Orchesta, to be precise) and the music was hauntingly rich and moving. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not going to spout off some specs I know nothing about, but I know deep, soul-moving sound when I hear it, and this is it right here.It easily synced with everything I threw at it. iPad, iPod, iPhone, MacBook and a PS Vita. All synced without a hitch. So now I knew it played music seamlessly with all my devices, but would it also be good for calls? This was always a gripe of mine when hunting around for a bluetooth speaker. None seemed to have the quality (and some didn't even have the capability) for voice calls and I can't justify this kind of price tag for something that's not going to have multiple purposes. My built in iPhone speaker is great on my 5S, but when I heard a call come in from three rooms away when I left my phone synced up to the Transit in the kitchen while I worked in my office, I was amazed that I could hear the phone ringing louder than my house phone. When using the Transit for a voice call, I could hear the caller very clearly and they claimed that the clarity was better than when I use my iPhone on speakerphone alone, which I tend to do all the time much to the annoyance of my friends and family. I haven't received any complaints since I've been using the Transit for calls.As if the amazing sound and voice quality weren't enough, I also love love love the included magnetic cover. Every other portable speaker I've ever had or seen has some junky little cloth bag to put your speaker in and tie up with a drawstring. The sleek magnetic cover on this speaker works flawlessly and ensures that the speaker won't be damaged when I'm traveling from place to place. I absolutely love this little speaker and I hope it lasts many years to come so I can continue to enjoy it daily.", "First off, the sound quality is not as good as this Bose unit I recently reviewed:Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth SpeakerCompared to the Bose, this one is boomy. But in all other respects, this is a good Bluetooth speaker.I've been using the unit off and on for a month on one charge. I admit I don't use it every day nor for hours on end, but the battery life is impressive, especially when on standby--you can set it aside for a while and be confident it will have juice when you need it. And to charge it, you plug it into either the supplied charging cable, or into any USB micro B charger (like most Android phones use) since that's the kind of port this uses to charge. So if you take this with you on the road, you don't have to remember to pack its charger if you already have a micro B charger in your travel bag. So that's an improvement over the Bose, which has a nonstandard charging connector.With its brushed aluminum and black finish, the unit has an attractive, upscale look to it, as well as good heft--it's a solid device and feels like it was made from quality materials. The kickstand holds the unit at just the right angle for tabletop music.Pairing is easy, and instructions are provided to help you along if you have any problems. The handsfree speakerphone capability works well and is convenient.", "\"Like most people, I love music and have quite a collection of what I consider to be good situational music for all kinds of occasions.  When I get home from a long and very frustrating day at work I turn on one of two things; A) symphonic suites or piano concertos to calm me down or B) symphonic suites and orchestral soundtracks from popular films to do the opposite so I feel motivated to go out and run or ride my motorcycle.  At this very moment, to stay in the upbeat, urban git'r done mood I have the soundtrack fromSpeed (Original Score)playing on my Transit Bluetooth speaker set and I'm loving it.  Have been using this new toy for almost a month and the results have been fantastic regardless of the situation(s) I've subjected it to or the music I've put through it.The Transit is, essentially, a high-quality wireless speaker system designed, primarily, for BT-enabled cellphones such as my iPhone 4S (I know, I'm a sellout).  It's designed to be a subtle device barely larger than a full-sized matchbox but sleek enough to not be an eye-sore if it is easily visible.  The Transit is ideal for any small-medium size room or moderately sized porch outdoors given you have decent acoustics.  For us, that being my nerdy buddies and I that meet once a week, it was easy to setup (literally, follow the 4-5 steps of instructions and you'll be fine or Read the Flippin' Manual (RTFM)) and even easier to control after that.To setup, we activated the sync button per the instructions so the Transit began searching for devices to sync up to.  We then went under the BT settings on my iPhone, linked them up, and are BFFs (Best Friends Forever if you don't understand Facebook lingo) for life.  Now, whenever I want to sync up the two BFFs whenever I get within range (roughly 20-30 feet depending on obstacles like walls) I walk over to the Transit, turn it on, and wait for the \"\"duh, duh\"\" sound to indicate that it's synced up.  I keep it off because, when I come home, I may not want it to automatically sync up and my notification sounds, minus the actual phone ringer, go through the Transit so I may be in the basement working and not hear that I got a text.  It also makes it easier to sync since all I have to do is turn on the Transit if I want to listen to music and the auto-sync does the rest.  This feature is super handy as it allows my technology savvy, yet lazy, self to keep things simple and stupid.Now, to test the sound quality, my buddies and I first put the speakers through a scenario that is the bane of many speakers: outside on the patio.The outdoors can be tricky or the bane of speakers as the acoustics are defined by your surroundings.  If you have an open space, you could be facing a real challenge as sound goes on, and on, and on in an open area meaning guests may be able to hear the music if they are in the direct line of sight.  I have a pair of Klipsch 2.1 PC speakers that I use for my AV editing lab and they work for crap outdoors despite the fact that they ROCK the walls, literally, indoors.  So, to see how well the Transit would perform, we picked some firewood out of the shed, put them in the fire pit, positioned the Transit in the corner of the patio next to the only power outlet, and had a bonfire (please, adhere to local fire codes as only YOU can prevent forest fires... especially with Smokey the Bear on furlough) whilst listening to Marty Robbins' \"\"Big Iron\"\" and other old-timey cowboy music as it seemed only appropriate.  We then set the volume to a respectful noise level to not irritate the neighbors and BS'd away around the fire.To our surprise, the Transit kept a good level of volume without getting scratchy or over buffering.  I was able to control the volume directly from my cellphone and could maintain good noise control from a distance as each song progressed.Later, I used the Transit near my hot tub on full blast, in my garage while I worked on my bike, and in the kitchen where it is now playing music fromFantasia 2000: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack(Firebird Suite in particular) and sounds great.  In fact, while writing this review I decided to test the Transit one last time by playing tracks from each extreme end of the spectrum including high bass with 80s bass from the Farcry 3: Blood Dragon soundtrack, high detail from aforementioned Fantasia 2000, Speed soundtrack, and some vocals withMeltdown (U.S. Version) (CD/DVD).  The sound quality remained consistent and super awesome the entire time.This is a worthy purchase for anyone that wants premier sound quality in an room.  You get what you pay for, and you're paying for awesome, so it's well worth the price.\"", "I'm really in love with this speaker. It's so stylish, rich and the sound just booms out of it!After watching a YouTube review on it, I had a good idea of what to expect. Luckily I'd just received a cheap Bluetooth speaker in which to compare it to.Upon first glance, it's very stylish and very well built. You can tell this isn't cheap plastic used to keep costs down, but instead a solid, quality product (and it's price reflects that). The kickstand on the back is discreetly placed and with the touch of a button exposes itself. Once out it provides a sturdy base in which to sit on.Pairing was a breeze, of course. No issues there, as it should be.I then opened up the music app on my HTC One with Beats (yes, the Beats are important, here!) and the sound that came out of such a tiny little speaker was ah-may-zing! This baby has bass. Not lots of it, but just enough to be tasteful. The power-on sound in itself is sexy! So good, in fact, I had to test out the audio jack and plug the speaker into my TV. Here's where there was a problem. When hooked up to the TV, I couldn't control the volume on the speaker via the TV's volume vs when I could using the HTC One's volume. I had kinda sorta had plans to use the speaker during movies, but that's not going to happen unless I can figure out a way to control the volume without getting off my couch.Now, the semi-boring stuff. I can easily walk around my apartment with my phone and the sound never drops out. I never really gauged the battery life on the speaker, but I'd put it at 3 hours or more, easily. I often fall asleep listening to it with a sleep timer on my phone set to 90 minutes. It wouldn't surprise me if the speaker lasts longer than 6 hours, actually. It's also smart enough to power itself off after a time of inactivity.I'm very impressed by this little speaker and will be using it for years to come!", "This is a great add on to you iPad or iPhone.  I have another cheaper similar device that I liked but wanted to see if there was something with better quality sound.  This is indeed much better that the one I had.  I used it recently to place Christmas music from my iPad throughout my office.  It should fantastic!  I got several compliments on its sound and questions as to where to get one and the cost.  I wish I could have told them it was inexpensive but it's really not in my book, but I also believe that quality cost more.  I do believe that even though it may not be inexpensive it is certainly worth every penny.", "\"The amazing things Soen says right here on Amazon about this speaker? TRUE!Amazing sound, amazing instant syncing  with our various music sources. We really really like the depth of sound. We have a Bose countertop speaker and this one is every bit as good. Better really because our Bose did not fit all our various things- iPhones didn't fit, the larger ipod didn't fit. But with Transit by Soen you can simply and super easily sinc the source with the speaker.We tested the speaker and the distance from the source to be about 40 feet through walls.The travel charger is a plus and the small size allows us to take it on trips to set up at our destination. The magnetic attaching cover helps protect it.This costs a bit but it is a really sturdy system- made of aircraft grade aluminum with a switch blade kickstand, great sound, easy to use and small enough to be portable.What's in the Box:TRANSIT Wireless SpeakerQuick Attaching MagPro(tm) CoverCompact Travel Charger3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable (36\"\" long)USB Charging Cable (36\"\" long)Quick Start Guide and User Guide\"", "This little portable speaker system is pretty darn impressive. The sound is absolutely fabulous for its size, and the design is sleek and impressive. This is a lot of awesome in a small package.I compared the sound to two other smallish, more or less portable systems that I own: theJBL On Tourand theBose Companion 2 Series I.The comparison with the JBL is fair -- they are about the same size and are designed to fill about the same needs -- although the speakerphone feature of the TRANSIT goes beyond the JBL's functionality, and the JBL was designed before Bluetooth really took off, so it's a wired speaker only. In short, the TRANSIT really kicks the JBL's behind in sound quality. And I really liked the JBL, I've been using it for years with no regrets and I listen to classical music with it quite a bit. The TRANSIT, however, just has so much more depth and richness in the lower registers that the old JBL can't keep up.This unit doesn't really do well in comparison with the Bose Companion 2 speakers, which kick the TRANSIT's behind just about as much as the TRANSIT trounces the JBL. But the comparison is not really fair, as the Bose Companion 2s are much larger, much less portable, and require an external power source.Also, this unit works great as external speakers for laptop- or tablet-based calls, like on Skype. The call quality on my end is great, and the people I speak with also get much better sound from me.For its size, I find the TRANSIT has exceptionally rich and deep sound. This will be my new portable speaker system of choice.", "\"Amazing!!!  I am very excited about this product.  The versatility of it is great.  I first plugged in my computer directly using the supplied 3.5\"\" cable. Gave nice sound, but my computer is not Bluetooth.  Then I hooked up my daughter's .MP3 player using the same cable.  Great sound.  I do with that the 3.5\"\" cable was a bit longer though.Now, on to Bluetooth testing.I connected the system to my Blackberry phone to test the ability to use it as a loud speaker and to make calls.  YES.  It has a built in microphone!!!  I made the call and it was really clear and the other party could hear me clearly.  The pairing process was quick and easy.Next I hooked up my son's Playstation Vita (portable gaming unit).  The pairing process was quick and easy on the PS Vita as well.  Next I played a video game through the speaker and man was it loud!!!  I moved the speaker far away from me.  About 10 feet.  And it seemed to be louder and the bass was even more pronounced.  Don't forget, bass frequencies are better when they have distance to travel.  Ever notice why sounds from another room emphasize the Bass more?  That's because Bass frequencies travel through walls while mid and high frequencies don't.This unit is amazing.  I love cover that goes over the front of the speaker.  It is a magnet that \"\"sticks\"\" to the front to protect the speaker when not used.  It has flaps that can be tucked under, so that you can easily unfold and cover the sides of the unit if you want.  Or to have access to on/off switch, you can fold the flaps underneath the cover and it just covers the front.I like that when you turn the system on, it automatically goes into pairing mode.  Very nice.  After so many seconds it goes back to normal mode.I really like this unit.  It is small and nice to be able to take with you where you want to go, but it delivers a big sound.I know that the price is a little high, but if you love gadgets, this speaker has so many uses that if you need one of these, this is the one to consider.\""], "Gamma": [0.13783222436904907, 0.13801638782024384, 0.13801638782024384, 0.058840226382017136, 0.13801638782024384, 0.13801322877407074, 0.25126516819000244], "Beta": [[0.012351005338132381, 0.17710523307323456, 0.08495962619781494, 0.11296803504228592, 0.28050222992897034, 0.00261480244807899, 0.06102795526385307, 0.13326577842235565, 0.0015165477525442839, 0.13353510200977325, 0.00015364852151833475], [0.012351085431873798, 0.177106112241745, 0.08496582508087158, 0.11297323554754257, 0.2804984748363495, 0.0026119076646864414, 0.061012234538793564, 0.1332705169916153, 0.0015147640369832516, 0.13354238867759705, 0.00015343179984483868], [0.012351085431873798, 0.177106112241745, 0.08496582508087158, 0.11297323554754257, 0.2804984748363495, 0.0026119076646864414, 0.061012234538793564, 0.1332705169916153, 0.0015147640369832516, 0.13354238867759705, 0.00015343179984483868], [0.011795829981565475, 0.1758999079465866, 0.08271342515945435, 0.11086958646774292, 0.2799251675605774, 0.004679178353399038, 0.06920197606086731, 0.13125954568386078, 0.0028803430031985044, 0.13044758141040802, 0.000327479065163061], [0.012351085431873798, 0.1771060675382614, 0.08496581017971039, 0.11297324299812317, 0.2804985046386719, 0.002611907897517085, 0.06101223826408386, 0.1332705169916153, 0.0015147640369832516, 0.13354240357875824, 0.00015343197446782142], [0.01235106959939003, 0.1771060973405838, 0.08496583253145218, 0.11297326534986496, 0.2804984748363495, 0.002611918607726693, 0.061012279242277145, 0.1332705318927765, 0.001514771138317883, 0.13354241847991943, 0.00015343267295975238], [0.02161092311143875, 0.17436151206493378, 0.0781211331486702, 0.10455678403377533, 0.29623857140541077, 0.0036873496137559414, 0.06682431697845459, 0.12296131253242493, 0.001914940308779478, 0.12956146895885468, 0.0001617122907191515]]}
