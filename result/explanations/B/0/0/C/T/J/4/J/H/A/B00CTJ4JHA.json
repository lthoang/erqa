Prior to trying this V8 snack bar, I always associated the \"\"V8\"\" name with their tomato/vegetable juice blend, which I love, especially the \"\"Spicy Hot V8\"\".  Although these new V8 snack bars do not include tomatoes like V8 juice, they do include carrots, sweet potatoes, and soluble corn fiber, which are three VERY unusual ingredients to use in a snack bar.Here are the ingredients and nutrition information:Ingredients: chocolate coating (sugar, fractionated palm kernel oil, cocoa powder (processed with alkali), lactose (milk), soy lecithin, soy protein isolate, sweet potato juice concentrate, soluble corn fiber, corn syrup, roasted peanuts (with salt and soybean oil), glycerine, roasted peanuts, rice crisp (rice flour, salt, barley malt extract), peanut butter, peanuts, dehydrated carrots, oats, sugar. Contains 2 percent or less of: partially defatted peanut flour, chocolate liquor, flavoring (peanuts, sesame oil, alpha tocopherol), natural butter flavoring (whey solids, enzyme-modified butter, maltodextrin, salt, dehydrated butter, annatto, turmeric [for color]), roasted peanut oil, maltodextrin, salt, natural flavoring, coca butter, natural flavor, soy lecithin, vanilla extract, peanut oil, butter (cream [milk]), sesame seed oil, natural flavors, rice extract.Nutrition Facts:Serving Size: 1 Bar (1.72 ounce)Servings Per Container: 6Amount Per Serving:Calories 200:Calories from Fat 80Total Fat: 9g 14%DVSaturated Fat: 3g 15%DVTrans Fat: 0gCholesterol: 5mg 2%DVSodium: 170mg 7%DVPotassium: 240mg 7%DVTotal Carbohydrate: 21g 7%DVDietary Fiber: 5g 20%DVSugars: 10gProtein: 10g 16%DVVitamin A: 15%DVVitamin C: 20%DVCalcium: 20%DVIron: 15%DVVitamin E: 20%DVVitamin K: 20%DVThiamin: 15%DVRiboflavin: 20%DVNiacin: 20%DVVitamin B6: 20%DVFolate: 20%DVVitamin B12: 20%DVPhosphorus: 25%DVIodine: 4%DVMagnesium: 25%DVZinc: 15%DVSelenium: 35%DVCopper: 10%DVManganese: 30%DVChromium: 80%DVPercent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.Both with the ingredients and nutritional content, these snack bars are similar to the Luna Bars \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" flavor,Luna Bars, Nutz Over Chocolate, 1.7-Ounce Bars, 15 Count, which I also love.  Both this V8 and the Luna nutrition bars use peanuts, chocolate, rice crisps, and oats.  The Luna Bars \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" has a slightly more firm and crunchy texture, whereas these V8 chocolate peanut butter bars are more soft and mealy like a protein bar.  If you frequently ski or snowshoe in the winter like I do, a softer snack bar like this is advantageous because they are less likely to turn into hard bricks while carrying them in backpacks in sub-freezing weather.  Although these are advertised as \"\"nutrition bars\"\", their 10 grams of protein have as much protein as snack bars that are advertised as \"\"protein bars\"\".  And unlike some protein bars that do not have much fiber, each V8 bar has 5 grams of fiber to help you feel less hungry.These bars' caloric, fat, sodium, and sugar content are average when compared to other healthy snack/nutrition/protein bars - not really high and not really low.  Some snack bars are lower in calories, fat, sodium, or sugar than these bars, but higher in some other areas.  For example, the Luna Bars \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" has slightly less calories and fat with zero cholesterol, but more sodium, than these V8 bars.Overall, these V8 bars have a nutritional composition that is very similar to the Luna Bars \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\".  Luna Bars have their nutritional content adjusted more for the needs of women, even though they are perfectly fine for men to also eat; their \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" flavor contains more iron, calcium, and iodine than these V8 bars.  But these V8 bars contain more fiber, calories, and three times the chromium than the Luna Bars.  Unlike the 25%DV chromium in the Luna Bars, these V8 bars have a whopping 80%DV of chromium due to the use of sweet potato juice in these bars.  Chromium helps to maintain your blood sugar, insulin, and cholesterol levels in your blood.  But considering that these V8 bars include dehydrated carrots, I am surprised by the modest 15%DV amount of vitamin A in each nutrition bar since carrots contain a large amount of vitamin A.  But the use of carrots and sweet potato juice in these snack bars may be a deal-breaker for you in that they add more of a strange taste when compared to most chocolate peanut butter snack bars.  Each of these V8 bars provides for 1/4 cup of vegetables, or a one-half serving of vegetables based on the USDA's recommended daily intake of 2 1/2 cups of vegetables for a 2000-calorie diet.If you do not have a fixed expectation of what a chocolate/peanut nutrition bar should taste like, these bars are worth a try.  You may like them if you keep an open mind.  If you want a more conventional chocolate/peanut flavor, especially if you are a woman, go for the Luna Bars \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" that has a nutritional content similar to these V8 bars, but without the carrots and sweet potato juice altering the flavor.  At the time of this review's writing, these V8 bars are priced at $1.00 per 1.7-ounce bar, whereas the Luna Bars have been priced for the past few months at an excellent price of $0.88 per 1.7-ounce bar.The inclusion of carrots and sweet potato juice does alter the peanut flavor in these V8 bars.  The chocolate flavor exists as a coating on the exterior of the bar and is not affected as much by the vegetable ingredients.  The chocolate flavor is pretty good; but, like all snack bars, it is not really gourmet chocolate.  Both these V8 bars and the Luna Bars use soy protein to fortify their protein content.  These V8 bars also contain whey solids.  Whey is derived from dairy sources and may cause gas, bloating, or cramps in some people, especially those with lactose intolerance.  And since this V8 bar contains whey, it is suitable for vegetarians like me, but not suitable for people on a strict vegan diet.I like the slightly different flavor in these V8 bars as much as I like the more conventional flavor of the \"\"Nutz Over Chocolate\"\" Luna Bars.  But then again, I also like eating plainly boiled Brussels sprouts with their bitter aftertaste, and I do not mind this unconventional approach of adding carrots and sweet potato juice to a chocolate peanut butter snack bar.  But I am glad that tomato juice was not also added to this nutrition bar's ingredients (to keep with the V8 juice theme) or else the flavor would have been far more strange.  It would be better if these V8 snack bars were totally free of GMO ingredients however.  The Luna Bars are officially free of ingredients sourced from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The V8 brand is owned by the Campbell Soup Company.  There is no GMO statement about these V8 bars, so I phoned the V8 Complete Nutrition Bar consumer affairs hotline at 800-341-5026.  They replied that their use of GMO ingredients is \"\"limited to sugar beets, corn, soybeans, rapeseed, and canola\"\".  These V8 bars contain corn fiber, corn syrup, and soy protein, thus these bars may contain GMO corn and soybeans.  There are many snack bars, and many packaged foods in general, that are not totally free of GMO ingredients.  But this is something to consider if you want to avoid foods containing GMO ingredients.\"", "Like most people, I've tried MANY nutrition/granola/meal replacement bars and I've never had one where I was impressed with the flavor enough to stick with it, until this one. Although I couldn't taste the peanut butter, I could taste the dark chocolate (yum) and I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty this bar is. I love that there is half a serving of veggies in this and I really like the size  and flat shape of this bar. I will definitely purchase these and other flavors in this line.", "\"First of all the good - I was able to taste both the chocolate and the peanut butter in this. But that is the limit of my \"\"good.\"\" It had an aftertaste I didn't enjoy, and was dry.I use nutrition bars a lot, and I will not be buying these after trying the sample I was sent. The main reason I am giving this three stars is that my granddaughter took the rest of my bar and ate it. So I figure if it made one of us content, it was worth an OK. Personally, I would have thrown out the rest of the bar.\"", "I think the fact these bars contains 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber within a 200 calorie snack package is great. They also taste pretty good, and I didn't experience an aftertaste. However, I think they are a bit expensive. There are other options with a better nutritional profile within the same price range...they usually have more protein and fewer calories for less than a buck and a half. The only thing you will miss out on is the 1/2 serving of vegetables.", "I was looking forward to trying the new V8 Complete Nutrition Bar, especially since the flavor was chocolate/peanut butter. The bar has a nice chewy consistency. The flavor of the chocolate is too strong (and I love chocolate)while the peanut butter taste is more subtle. My mouth was left with a yucky aftertaste and I couldn't finish the bar. You'll find things like sweet potato juice and dehydrated carrots listed in the ingredients. But you'll also see: corn syrup, peanut oil, sugar, fractionated palm kernel oil, and enzyme modified butter...just to list a few. I cannot recommend this product.", "Not bad but not my favorite bar. These bars have 10 g protein, 5 g fiber,  serving of vegetables at 200 calories a pop, which I thought was a bit high. The 10 g of protein is good and it's filling enough to cover a meal on the fly, if necessary. This is more on the line of protein type of bar - chewier - than granola bars and I think more suited to pre or post workout meal than every day. I prefer Kashi bars more.I think there's a demographic for this product and the V-8 folks produce a good quality product so my suggestion is to try one and see how it tastes to you. And go from there.", "\"These nutrition bars are pretty small. They are only 1.72 ounces each. They make a good snack if you are looking for a small snack. The flavor is good. It has a good mix of chocolate and peanut butter.As far as the \"\"nutrition\"\" goes, I don't like that out of the 200 calories, 80 come from fat. On the positive side, it does have 10 grams of protein in each bar.\"", "I was pleased with this bar. It tasted great - the chocolate came through very well without the usual heavy artificial taste that chocolate covered bars often have. The peanut butter was clearly there but not overpowering.The bar is soft and chewy, which is what I prefer, but it had some crunch to it due to (I assume) toasted rice. The overall result was very appealing and not messy to eat on the run (provided you peel back the wrapper so you don't get chocolate on your fingers).It is rather sweet - almost candy-bar sweet. If the sweetness was dialed down a bit this would be a five-star product. As it is it remains a decent protein bar that I would certainly get again.", "I'm not sure if it was more the flavor or texture of theV8 Chocolate Peanut Butter Complete Nutrition Barthat I didn't care for, but it after eating half the bar I was done. I'm normally a fan of anything peanut butter so it did surprise me that I didn't enjoy it more.  With so many nutrition bar options available today this one won't be making it back into my pantry, but I will continue to buy bothV8 Low Sodium 100% Vegetable JuiceandV8 V-Fusion Peach Mango 100% Juicewhich I am a fan of.", "Upon receiving this V8 Nutrition bar I opened it for a taste...it was extremely nutty which I like right away...the dark chocolate was not to my taste at all since it was a bit bitter and I could not taste any peanut butter whatsoever...this product came from Amazon and it is not one I would purchase again.  I almost expected a tomato taste with the V8 brand so had to chuckle when it was indeed chocolate and nuts.  You might want to try it but I cannot recommend it to anyone I know.  There are too many other delicious nutritious bars out there...(V8 Complete Nutrition Bar, chocolate Peanut Butter (pack of 6)", "I wasn't sure what to expect with a nutrition bar from V8, would it taste like V8 juice? No! Thank goodness!The flavor that I tried was Chocolate Peanut Butter and it tasted pretty good for a nutrition bar. All the nutrition, protein or meal replacement bars that I've tried have similar tastes but some have this really weird stale taste to me and this one didn't. I think they pretty much all kind of have a chemical taste to them. The real test was that I split this with my husband and he liked it and he don't like a whole of these so we give it a thumbs up on taste.It has 200 calories so this is more of a meal replacement then a snack and it has  a serving of vegetables which is better than not getting any I suppose. It has 9g of fat. 21g of carbs with 5g of fiber so you get 16 net carbs if you are one that counts the net carbs so it's pretty decent on the carb count too.We liked it and thought it tasted good and it tastes just like a chocolate and peanut butter nutrition bar and you can't taste the veggies.", "This might give you some needed nutrition if you can stand to eat it. It's a good size bar and is 200 calories. When I took a bite I didn't taste anything but the heavy dark bitter chocolate that drizzles on the top and is fully coated on the bottom of the bar. You just can't get past that bitter taste that leaves a very bad flavor in your mouth after. I walked over to my neighbors before throwing it out and had her take a bite because she likes dark chocolate and is diabetic so she eats a lot of these kinds of bars and is use to the off taste but she hated it too. I give a big fat Zero for this product and am very happy that I only received one single bar because I would have thrown them all out if I had gotten a full box of these. They sure look pretty but in this case, looks are very deceiving....", "\"I actually like the taste of this bar, but to call it a \"\"complete nutrition\"\" bar is pushing the envelope a bit.  Maybe opening it.  In essence, you're looking at a protein bar and perhaps V8 would have done a bit better had they marketed it as one.  I often am looking for additional protein sources by the end of the day and with 10 grams it's not bad.  I've seen some protein bars at around 7 grams while others go way over 20.What many people dislike may be the soy protein and the whey solids, neither which turn on the taste buds for many people.  There's nothing really offensive in the ingredients list, but take a close look because there are a lot of them.  The veggies are lower on the list so I'd consider them as not factoring into the formula.  Like it, yes.

I couldn't taste any veggies, but I'm willing to trust that they are there.  It had nice flavor; not the best I've ever had, but tasty enough to enjoy.  The only reason I gave it four stars is the dark chocolate.  I'm not fond of dark chocolate and I don't care how healthy it is.  It's not even a tenth as good as milk chocolate.  But if you like dark chocolate, you just might find yourself really loving these bars.  And I think that children wouldn't believe there were veggies in it if you didn't let them see the box and took the bar out of the wrapper!

I enjoyed the chocolate and peanut butter flavor. I like that it has more nutrition then most bars.", "I love the a. It is a great company which helps us get our vegetables in a great tasting way.This is another great item to add to the V 8 family. I love the chocolate and peanut combination with a little rice crispy crunch. It was very filling, and tasted delicious.

I tasted chocolate with no peanut butter flavor at all. The texture is fine but I guess I was expecting more from this product. Kind of high in calories and I am sure these is a lot of nutrition in theses bars but I don't think I would purchase them in the future.", "I am a little at a loss to understand the purpose of these bars. The amount of sugars in them makes them a candy bar. But they have none of the candy bar deliciousness. The coating has a weird mouth feel instead of being rich and melty like chocolate. The bar has a weird Styrofoam texture with the occasional bit of grit. And the flavor wasn't that great. The flavor left my mouth with a weird dry feeling.I appreciate opportunities to improve my nutrition but this is not well implemented. For this amount of sugar you could have a candy bar. Just eat a salad too. It will taste better.", "The V8 Complete Nutrition Bar, Chocolate Peanut Butter, 1.72 Ounce Bars is a delicious, nutritious bar from a respectable company that makes and produces food variants from vegetables. V8 is a notable brand of juices from fuits and vegetable. The V8 Complete Nutrition Bar is delicious and packs an adequate amount of protein (10g/bar) but it is a little on the high side of calories. It can be a great daily supplement if you are working out or lifting weights where protein is an essential part of muscle building and the calories for energy. I took mine after my workout for calorie and protein replenishment and pretty much gave me a full feeling. This can be better if not for 200 calories per bar which I think is a little bit more of what you actually need if you want these for plain snacking. Nevertheless, I still liked it for its taste and the protein content.", "The short version of my review is that this bar tastes just so-so, and I would not buy them, but if you want some more details, please read on. I got one bar free from Amazon Vine, and when I opened it up it clearly had melted because the chocolatey coating fell out all over the floor and me in little flakes. So that wasn't a great start to my experience, plus it may have affected the taste and texture of the bar since it wasn't in perfect condition when I ate it. There was still enough chocolate smeared all over the bar that it had a very strong, very sweet, slightly-dark-chocolatey taste. I consider myself sort of a connoisseur of chocolate, and I will only say the coating tasted chocolatey or chocolatish since it didn't taste like any really yummy chocolate I've ever had. The sweetness of the coating (with a slight hint of bitterness) overwhelmed any other flavor the bar may have had. The product information talks about a salty peanut taste, and I didn't get that at all. The bulk of the bar itself is chewy with tiny bits of crunch, but no real discernible peanut or peanut butter taste. And the bar left an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth, so while it served as a quickly lunch substitute it wasn't a product I can recommend.", "I didn't taste the peanut butter whatsoever but aside from that, this is pretty tasty. There is a light drizzle of chocolate like something to give a hint of sweet. Good balance between crunch and chew. Overall pretty yummy although the after-taste is a bit strong for my preference. Spouse didn't notice whatsoever. I'd be inclined to pick this up over most other similar type bars due to the better than average flavor.", "On Saturday morning, for breakfast, I ate one V8 Chocolate Peanut Butter Complete Nutrition Bar and a glass of low-fat milk.  (I had numerous chores to perform around my apartment and was hard pressed for time.)  The V8 bar was surprisingly delicious.  I love the taste of chocolate and peanut butter and grew up on eating Reeses Peanut Butter Cups [Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 36)].  However, because I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), I often purchase a box of Fiber One 90 Calorie Chocolate Peanut Butter Chewy Bars (Fiber One Chewy Bars 90 Calorie Chocolate Peanut Butter - 20/0.82oz).I ate the V8 bar at approximately 8:00 A.M. and didn't feel any hunger pains until approximately 11:00 A.M.  The V8 bar has five grams of fiber.  My Fiber One bar also has five grams of fiber.  Therefore, I know the V8 bar will help relieve my IBS.  As I said earlier, the bar was delicious; it was very thick and chewy.  However, there was the slightest hint of vegetable matter.  It became less noticeable the more I ate the bar.  The V8 bar has only 200 calories and the glass of low-fat milk I drunk had 100 calories.  Together, the two made a quick, nutritious meal.  I only wish Amazon and V8 had sent me an entire box.Normally, I keep a box of Fiber One bars at work in case I forget my Activia Yogurt for breakfast or have a craving for a chocolate dessert.  After comparing my Fiber One 90 Calorie Bars to the V8 Complete Nutrition Bars, I've decided that the V8 bars are more nutritious and satisfying.  For example, the Fiber One bars only have one gram of protein; the V8 bar has ten grams!  Also, the V8 bars have a slew of vitamins and nutrients (e.g., A, B6, B12, C, K, magnesium, niacin, phosphorus, zinc, and calcium) that are not listed on the box for the Fiber One bars.  I will begin buying V8 bars for my home and office.Joseph B. Hoyos", "Many vitamins and minerals your body needs come from vegetables.

For once the chocolate is the dominant taste so chocoholics beware - you might have found that perfect snack that tantalizes your taste buds while relieving a large dose of guilt. The V8 branding is an interesting move on their part because I'm not sure what serving of fruit or vegetables this contains!

Mind you, I love and support the V8 brand, but I'm not particularly impressed with this new offering.  Having sampled most protein bars on the market, I find this offering pretty standard.  It has a good flavor, but is quite grainy as well.  The chocolate peanut butter taste is decent, but does not come across as very natural.  The bar has 10g of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and weighs in at 200 calories with nine grams of total fat.  As a meal alternative, it might do in a pinch but there are tastier options on the market with a similar composition.What is the primary selling point?  It is also the equivalent of a half serving of vegetables.  Oh well, think I'd rather have a V8!  I appreciate that V8 is trying to expand their brand, I'm going to stick a little closer to home.

My husband is a HUGE dark chocolate fan - the more cocoa the better.  He LOVED this.  We halved it.  He said if I found them again to buy them.  They are high in protein, 10g, with 5 grams of fiber.  They taste a bit like the Quaker bars, but these are not as sweet.  They say they have 1/2 serving of veggies per bar.  It's like a peanut-ty, granola bar with dark chocolate coating on the bottom, sides and a bit on the top.  No transfats.  200 calories per bar-they are a MUCH better alternative to candy bars to pack for my husband's lunch.", "Who knew veggies could taste so good? No really, they say that each bar contains 1/2 serving of vegetables but I would never have known that if I hadn't read it first. It tasted just like a regular chocolate-covered granola bar to me. Maybe not the best I've ever tasted, but pretty good. I especially liked the chocolate icing on top of the bar. It is a little messy (melts easily) so have a napkin or tissue handy.Therefore, these make for a healthier breakfast bar, or between-meals or late evening snack. And if you can't get your kids to eat veggies, these bars can maybe fill in a little. Though I do think you get the maximum health benefits by eating fresh veggies.If this were just a granola/snack bar without the veggies I would give it maybe only 4 stars. The veggies and extra nutrition I think warrants the extra star.I'm very impressed with the veggies aspect and will definitely buy these bars in the future when looking for a granola or snack bar. It's a great idea that turned out pretty good!", "I had higher hopes for these energy bars than I've had for others.  V-8 likes to advertise themselves as using real ingredients, so I was hoping for something that tasted more like chocolate, peanut butter, and grains than chemicals.  I didn't find it.  The bar is very thick and dense, so I imagine it's quite filling (I couldn't finish mine, as I couldn't stand the taste).  But bulk is about all I can recommend.  The flavor is very fake and slightly chemical, and it has a chalky texture.  So, as mentioned, I couldn't finish mine because it did not taste very good at all.", "These weren't too bad. Both my daughter and I tried it and agreed it is something we would eat again. However they seem pretty expensive so unless I can find a good deal on these I won't be trying them again.

The texture is nice, chewy and almost crunchy times from the peanuts and puffed rice.Nutrition is so-so, it provides some nutrients and fiber but has 200 calories and almost as much fat as protein. It is more like a dessert bar more than a candy or granola bar.Overall, it's better than most nutrition bars I have tried but there are certainly healthier ways to eat vegetables."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.027135690674185753, 0.03506535291671753, 0.03675251081585884, 0.036315470933914185, 0.031687360256910324, 0.028322527185082436, 0.03318941593170166, 0.03211633116006851, 0.03258795663714409, 0.03223346546292305, 0.02954167127609253, 0.03383394330739975, 0.02633608691394329, 0.03216670826077461, 0.03387832269072533, 0.034744955599308014, 0.03428256884217262, 0.02987334504723549, 0.028604824095964432, 0.03134157136082649, 0.030416006222367287, 0.029811836779117584, 0.02996053732931614, 0.026450399309396744, 0.02105891704559326, 0.034489523619413376, 0.030724171549081802, 0.032031890004873276, 0.030387097969651222, 0.03353133052587509, 0.03362498804926872, 0.0275032427161932]]}
