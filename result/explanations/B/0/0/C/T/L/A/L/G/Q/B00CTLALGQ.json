"], "reviews": ["I should first admit that I was a bit confused by the packaging of these Melitta K-Cups. The label claims &#34;light and dark roast,&#34; so I thought that there were two varieties in this package. Looking at the Amazon description, however, it becomes clear that it is a blend (&#34;An exotic harmony of light and dark roast coffees&#34;).I suppose I'd describe it more as a dark roast than light roast. It has a mild aroma with medium bitterness. It's definitely drinkable. In other words, I've had a lot better, I've had a lot worse. It has some extra packaging, a &#34;freshness seal,&#34; that is supposed to hold in the flavor and aroma. Unfortunately, I don't think it does much better than other K-Cup varieties (none of which can quite match freshly ground coffee).As far as K-Cups go, this is a decent choice. Although, it's nothing to write home about.", "By way of disclosure, I received a free sample of this product for evaluation purposes.  I have tried to be objective.I have been drinking coffee for decades now and have used everything from drip brewers to French presses.  At work, I use a Keurig machine because I can't stand the company coffee.  I've had it for more than eight years now.These Melitta cups yield a decent cup of dark roast coffee.  Each pod comes enclosed in a plastic packaging shell to preserve freshness.  You have to peel the top back, remove the filter pod.  When it is in your Keurig brewer, only the top needle punctures the filter pod -- the hot water flows into the pod and out of its sides, which are a filter material.The resulting cup of coffee is a fairly full bodied dark roast.  I could brew a larger cup (around 10 oz.) without the coffee seeming too watery.  Also, I did not notice much sediment in the cup, which sometimes occurs with non-standard pods designed to replace K cups in a Keurig brewer.So, the pro here is that you get a pretty good cup of dark roast coffee.  The con is that there is extra packaging waste associated with each pod.No, it's not going to be as good as French press coffee, but if you like Melitta coffee this is a convenient way to brew a cup at a time.", "First off, the packaging is fantastic--even better than Keurig's own cup.  The entire cup is a filter so it not only yields more coffee but you can reuse the cups without compromising taste.  We actually can use these camping (cowboy coffee style) even without a K-cup brewer.  Love that.This particular roast (a mix of light and dark--not 6 dark cups and 6 light like I was expecting but a mix of light and dark roast in each cup) was a bit too strong for me and not very smooth with a bit of a harsh taste.  While I didn't love the roast, I will be trying other Melitta flavors until I find the one that's perfect for me.", "This Blanc et Noir coffe is pretty good. It's a nice flavor, and it has a hint of sweetness to it. I'd consider buying it again.What might stop me from buying it again, though, is the packaging. For some reason the manufacturers have decided to use an alternate K-cup design that exposes more coffee to the filter. In order to do this, each cup is further packaged in its own single packaging, as well as being in the box. This seems like a real waste of packaging. I suppose this may have an effect on brewing, but the practical effect for me is I'm throwing more away.", "I thought my husband was going to cry when he realized we were out of these kcups. There was definitely a pout. These are his favorite coffee pods now. He usually likes his coffee the darker and stronger the better but was delighted with this flavor saying it had surprising depth. It smelled divine. The filter system Melitta uses inside the kcup just seems to make a smoother cup of coffee. I will have to order these for him when he runs out of all his other, now inferior coffee.", "I thought this coffee tasted good.  The extra packaging is only a bit more in the landfill than standard K-cups because standard K-cups have both an outer plastic cup and an inner filter, plus a lid.  These Melita K-cups are all mesh filter kept fresh inside a plastic outer container with a peel-off lid.  You peel off the lid, take out the little mesh cup filled with coffee, and use it in your Kuerig.  I think possibly the coffee flavor is richer because the water is passing through an all mesh K-cup instead of a plastic K-cup.  I normally use a refillable K-cup in my Keurig because it costs less.  But if I were to buy some single-use K-cups I would definitely consider these by Melita providing the cost was in line with regular style cups.", "This Europa Blanc et Noir blend was quite nice.  I definitely describe it as a dark roast, though it is listed as a dark/light blend.  It has a very smooth taste and no bitterness or after taste at all even with do cream or sweetener.  It is a great blend for 'black' coffee drinkers like me.As I stated for other Melitta K-Cup varieties my only minor complaint is that there seems to be a bit of wasteful packaging. These Melitta &#34;k-cups&#34; come inside a container that has to be tossed, then the coffee in a filter basket with a plastic covering is used in the K cup brewer.I'd recommend it for those that light a strong medium to dark roast that has a smooth finish.", "Sometimes when you think that something just can't be improved, there is a company that surprises you.  Melitta put the coffee into a K-cup that has it's insides exposed; you can see the coffee and filter through a ribbed plastic exterior.  This filter cup comes in a sealed container to keep it fresh.  When you peel back the plastic, you can immediate smell a burst of coffee that sets the mood.  There is a little lip on the underside so that the Keurig mechanism can't puncture the plastic cup.  This allows the coffee to flow out of the cup from the filter evenly around the entire cup.  The smell is just the precursor.  This is a terrific cup of coffee.  I'm sold.", "\"I'll admit, that while the taste of the coffee is good it isn't as good as some of the other stuff you'll get out there. It's strong and you can smell it beforehand, but in the end if you're a very picky consumer that goes only based on the taste of the coffee, you might end up passing this one over.What really impressed me about this is that the entire packaging can be recycled. It might seem wasteful at first glance, as the K-cup filter is contained in a plastic wrapper. The reason behind this is that regular K-cups have a plastic lining that keeps them from melting but also makes it pretty much impossible to recycle through any of the conventional means. (Recycling bins and whatnot.) The plastic wrapper was added to this because that way the coffee can be kept fresh and the K-cup itself can be made out of recyclable materials without having to worry about adding this plastic liner. You do have to cut open the container at the end and remove the coffee, but that's a small issue if you're worried about whether or not your K-cup is recyclable... and you should be worried. People are using so many K-cups that there's a new and pressing need to find a way to make K-cups recyclable. This isn't perfect, but it's an excellent start.However I know that many of you will wonder why you should choose this over the \"\"My K-cup\"\" stuff out there that allows you to create your own K-cup from whatever coffee you choose. The simple fact is that not all Keurig machines allow you to install the reusable filters. My work has two machines, one that will allow you to use the reusable filters of any variety and one that cannot. This type of K-cup is good for when you are going places and either can't bring your reusable K-cup with you or the machine won't allow you to use it. Again, this isn't a perfect alternative but at least it is an alternative that's better than using a K-cup that can't be recycled and will be around for years to come.There are other options out there than this, such as the semi-reusable/refillable K-cups that you can use up to a certain amount of times, but this is another good option out for those who want something other than the un-recyclable K-cups. For many this won't be something they look for, but if you want something you can recycle that tastes pretty good then this is a good thing to look for.\"", "FINALLY!  Someone has made a wonderful tasting coffee that is just so very rich, smooth, non-bitter, that you can use your big 12 ounce mugs with no loss of flavor.  Heavens, I fell in love with this so fast that I even took two of these and used it in my percolator!  Oh, I can't tell you how amazing that pot of coffee was that day.  If you like a richer brew, one more flavorful, then be SURE to give this a spin.  If you're more of the lighter roast preferences, then you probably will find this to be a bit strong.Here's an added plus: If you're like me and like to take your k-cups out of their original boxes and put them in one of those stands, then THESE HAVE THE EXPIRATION DATE PRINTED ON THE K-CUP!  None of the other brands that I've used so far have ever done that.  NO more stale coffee!  SO glad the folks at Melitta are dedicated to coffee!The coffee was black when I poured it from my percolator, not light brown, and it was steaming hot.  Have I made you get up and make a pot yet?!!! So awesome, SO glad I found this, SO will be ordering it forever!  Plus, Melitta has developed a new k-cup so that when you open it, you have that fresh coffee aroma instead of just a piece of foil like the others have.That said, they do make you prime your Keurig a bit more often because I think there's more contact with the actual coffee in these pods.  No worries, however.  If that's what it takes to get a great cup of coffee from my Keurig, then, Oh well!  Guess I'm priming!HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!", "\"I really appreciate a full bodied, flavorful and hot cup of coffee any time of day and these fit the bill to a \"\"T\"\".I had no problem with a muddy mouth feel as someone else said and really like the strength in these packs.  The aroma on opening the packet is wonderful.\"", "i have to say i LOVE these cups! i like the way they are packaged. i like the way that the water can get to the coffee and make a good cup of coffee for the morning. what i wasn't bowled by was the lack of body in what is supposed to be a full bodied roast. i would love to try another variety that is deeper in flavor than this.", "I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I tried Melitta Cafe de Europa Blanc et Noir, Light and Dark Roast. I guess I was expecting something close to a medium roast coffee since this roast is a blend of light and dark roasts. I was wrong though. Melitta Cafe de Europa Blanc et Noir is definitely comparable to a dark roast. It's a slightly bitter, strong blend. Dark roasts aren't normally my favorite coffees, but I found Melitta Cafe de Europa Blanc et Noir enjoyable. Someone that enjoys darker roasts will probably enjoy it even more. If a darker roast is your roast of choice, I recommend Melitta Cafe de Europa Blanc et Noir. If you normally enjoy lighter roasts, then this probably isn't the coffee for you.", "Generally, I'm looking for ways to soften the use of my Keurig on the budget, not make it harder on the budget. The Melitta Single Cups are a definite exception to that idea.First, the design: the actual cup for the machine is an open filter, so the packaging is designed to hold the cup sealed until the coffee drinker is ready for it. That design is nice, though it produces a bit more trash. In many locations, the extra is completely recyclable--just not out here in the middle of nowhere.The flavor is nice. The idea of mixing light and dark roasts seemed silly, but I must agree with the other reviewers that comment that this gives a smooth flavor like a light but with a great aroma.In all, if you want to spend a bit more, the Melitta Cafe de Europa Blance et Noir is a nice treat.", "This is not even a distant cousin of coffee. I put my Keurig K-cup brewer on the 4 ounce setting and out came an amazingly weak and nearly tasteless liquid that was essentially odorless as well. I then tried the other four settings but not one of them could make this resemble coffee in the slightest. This is absolutely the worst attempt at coffee that I have ever experienced. Not only is this not drinkable but the way it is packaged it will leak liquid on your brewer and spill grounds into the K-cup holder and into the cup of swill that landed in your coffee cup. Don't waste your money on this. Stay far, far away. Buy some Starbucks or Green Mountain or Tully's or just about any other brand except for this pigswill.", "Great dark roast coffee!  I love these Melitta single cup coffee.  They are in a stay fresh pack that really makes the difference in flavor.  I enjoy strong coffee similar to starbucks.  This coffee delivers!.", "These Melitta coffee singles work great in my K-cup brewer.  While this is described as a mixture of light and dark roast, I think it has a bold taste but it is smooth.  There is NO bitterness as with some bold coffees.  My husband usually likes medium coffee and I usually like dark, but we both like this blend.  It is really a nice cup of coffee!I bought a Starbucks and a Green Mountain pack of K-cups after this one and my husband said he really wants this one again.  So, I'm off to order it!", "This is excellent tasting coffee. Strong but very smooth. I made my first cup this morning and loved it so much I had another which is not like me. I usually drink Capuccinos but this is just excellent  black. Love it and will order some more. Great product!!!!!", "A robust and balanced blend that does not overwhelm with bitterness, yet retains a full-bodied flavor. For American tastes that have moved away from regular Folgers to the more European-tasting brews available at, say, Starbucks, Melitta's Cafe de Europa Blanc et Noir blend will represent a comfortable and familiar taste that still marks a welcome departure from standard home or fast-food fare. Recommended as an everyday coffee that should be enjoyed on its own, rather as a beverage with breakfast or other foods (although one can imagine it going well with a chocolate cake).", "Melitta's Blanc et Noir combines a light roast with a dark roast for a unique taste. It combines the bright acidity of a light to mid roast with the fuller body of a dark roast. The smoky taste of a true dark roast is definitely tamed in this coffee. What is left is a very satisfying cup of coffee.As has been noted, Melitta's packaging for their coffee is different than most. While the coffee is designed to be used in Keurig coffee makers, it is not a licensed product. The coffee capsules are in plastic packages with a peel off lid. Inside is the coffee, in a basket lined with filter paper. While Melitta makes claims about the recyclability of their packaging, it is doubtful that most would go through the trouble to clean out the coffee to recycle.I have tried 4 different varieties of Melitta K-Cup compatible coffee capsules, and this is definitely my favorite. It strikes a good balance between a dark roast and medium roast. It has good body without bitterness.", "The Blanc and Noir is a mix of a dark roast and a light roast, which produces a well rounded, tasty medium roast.  We've tried other Melitta K-Cups and have been happy with them and this was no exception.  The dark and light are well balanced giving a flavorful cup of coffee.", "I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I'm a fan if these Melitta K-Cups.  They produce a bold flavor without the sour aftertaste that makes me avoid most, cheap coffee.  I can easily drink this without any creamer or sugar.The packaging is kind of unique in that each cup is enclosed in a larger cup that you have to peel open first.  The actual K-Cup has mesh sides, and you get a nice whiff of ground coffee when you peel the package open.  It's definitely a K-Cup product that I would buy again.", "My wife and I cover coffee from medium to extra strong. She likes a strong flavorful coffee while I prefer the more balanced medium blends.I found this coffee to be to be much stronger than what I drink.My wife found it to be a good strength.We both found it to have a bitter taste and a slightly muddy mouth feel.What is &#34;muddy&#34;, it is a feeling of something other than water and coffee in your cup.Overall, we found this to be bitter and not that enjoyable.", "Having already reviewed two other versions of this product (Medium and Vienna Roast), I will note what I stated there about the overall concept of the packaging. Each packet comes sealed in its own separate plastic container. You merely peel the lid off and an inner container goes in the Keurig brewer. While it is a bit of an extra step, the freshness of the coffee cannot be rivaled by standard k-cup containers.As for this particular brew, it is my favorite of the their coffee pods thus far.  It is supposed to be a blend of light and dark coffees but the overall effect is one of rich flavor without being overpowering.  The aroma is excellent, as is the flavor, and it is an amazingly smooth blend with little acidity.  An excellent cup of coffee that would go wonderfully with a great dessert after dinner - and might be a dessert in itself.", "First off, I want to say, the coffee is good. It's strong Italian-style, bitter and dark-tasting, but not very strong. This light and dark mix is a good idea.However...If you're reading this, I assume you have a Keurig machine, and you know how K-cups work. Holes get punched in the top and the bottom. Hot water goes in, and hot coffee or tea or whatever comes out. It's clean, it's self contained.That's not how these cups work. The bottom is raised from the edge, so it never gets punched. Instead, there are filters in the sides of the cup. A hole gets punched in the top, water goes in, comes out the sides, and drips down to your cup.  Seems fine? Not so much. Keurig machines aren't meant to get liquid in the cup receptacle. I mean, I'm sure the *machine* can handle it fine, but what about your coffee after repeated use? There's no insert you can take out and wash. You're going to be running your fresh coffee over old, stale coffee, every subsequent time.So, I know the licensing fee is probably high, and I know Melitta makes great filters... but I really wish they'd put this blend into a proper K-cup and be done with it. I won't be using this product further.", "I was a surprised when I saw the packaging on the Melitta Single Cup Coffee. First you need to pull back the top label, then remove the plastic from the bottom of the K-Cup. According to Melitta, this makes for a fresher cup of coffee. Though the box says the extra packaging is eco-friendly, it struck me as being over the top. Why not just use a foil lined bag to protect the freshness instead of extra plastic on the bottom and an extra sticker on the top?Anyway, given the extra steps to open an individual K-Cup I was expecting a very tasty coffee but found the taste to be good but not great.Overall, it is just a decent cup of K-Cup coffee dressed up in extra material.", "\"I can't give this one 5 stars due to the waste. The cup is in an additional plastic \"\"cup\"\". The reason is clear, the coffee cup has a regular filter rather than being in the plastic as usual. That means to keep it fresh and in tact, they have to put it in an additional layer of plastic. I think they could have put it in some sort of paper container.That aside, the coffee is one of the better coffees I have had from a K cup. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a medium brew coffee that is not bitter. Not like Starbucks, closer to Seattle's Best in flavor, but a little bit more complex. If they can get the packaging worked out they will have a winner.\"", "I really didn't know what to expect from this product. When I ordered it, I actually thought that half the K-cups were light roast and the other half would be dark roast. But as it turns out, the K-cups are all the same, they're a blend of light and dark roast. I drink my coffee black and I have to say that it has a very strong taste, not what I would expect from a blend and a little on the burned side. But some people might like it as I thought it tasted similar to Starbuck coffee, having that bold flavor.", "Loved it! This was so easy to use and the flavor of the coffee was excellent. I would gladly recommend this item to others and will be having it regularly in my home.", "The Melitta Singe Cup Coffee for K-Cup brewers was a fantastic find! I love the idea of the K-Cup but it is hard to always produce a great cup of coffee. The Melitta way is a tad different than the traditional K-Cup approach. I was skeptical but now I prefer this brand and way of doing things. The aroma is overwhelming and it feels like you are making the perfect cup. Tastes great and feels like a fresher product than regular Keurig. Give it a try!", "Waking up is hard enough without having to decide Light Roast or Dark?  Melitta solves the dilemma. You get that great aroma of a dark roast, but not that burned aftertaste or the sourness. Too often a light roast lacks the aromatic invitation of its darker cousin, but this has a whole lot of fragrance. And while dark roasts might be too acid, some light roasts don't have that deep coffee flavor. I'm happy to report Black et Noir is neither acidic nor lacking in taste.  It's nice perky way to wake up in the morning, and gentle on the stomach. Two cups or even three won't have your innards roiling. At the same time, it's rich enough for an after dinner brew. The flavor is strong enough to stand up to an infusion of brandy if you are so inclined. Not the perfect cup of coffee, but for a basic every day cup of joe, it's just fine.The K-cups are well designed, fit perfectly into my Keurig, and there are few if any grounds in the cup.Four stars for a good basic blend.", "I've tried a number of Melitta's other K-Cup offerings, and I was pleased to get to try the Blanc et Noir or Light and Dark Roast.  As the name might suggest, this is a pretty middle of the road coffee.  It has decent flavor, but it is not too dark.  The acidity is moderate, and it doesn't really have a lot of bite.  However, it is not very rich or robust.  Perhaps riding the fence guarantees a mediocre experience.  It is good, but it does not delight.  I would suggest the Vienna Roast as a nice alternative for those who prefer a more robust flavor."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.028853800147771835, 0.031056441366672516, 0.03927672654390335, 0.033942367881536484, 0.03569713979959488, 0.030049089342355728, 0.019210955128073692, 0.03430245816707611, 0.025416672229766846, 0.028696469962596893, 0.038553159683942795, 0.03899547457695007, 0.015819989144802094, 0.028043590486049652, 0.028304221108555794, 0.034218065440654755, 0.033966876566410065, 0.03564474731683731, 0.014977783896028996, 0.01868763193488121, 0.030567653477191925, 0.029189113527536392, 0.0351424366235733, 0.024921931326389313, 0.03500896692276001, 0.0314292348921299, 0.04536880925297737, 0.036222636699676514, 0.038663510233163834, 0.03630709648132324, 0.02835255116224289, 0.03511238098144531]]}
