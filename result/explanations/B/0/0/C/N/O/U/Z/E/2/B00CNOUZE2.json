"], "reviews": ["If you have a hard time shaving in the shower because of all the steam, Cassani's newly designed fogless shower mirrors are great! They are good quality at a very good price and they live up to their word. I had originally ordered this for my fiance, but my son took it over as soon as I got it! He's 15 and new to the world of manly shaving. I had him give it a try and let me know what he honestly thought about it and he really liked it! It also came with a razor holder! It's great for men & women and it's not got all the hassle of a fogged up mirror, so you can see what you're actually doing. Their Anti-Fog Nanotechnology repels fog and helps you focus on the important stuff, like getting the best shave you can! I would recommend this great mirror for anyone, but if you are on a budget, like myself, it is a steal and it works really well. I was so happy that even at the awesome price I received it for, that it lived up to be a quality item and my son is happy. Because if my baby ain't happy, ain't nobody happy! Check out this cool new design and grab one for yourself or a loved one today!", "My adult sons use this mirror and really like it. The product description is accurate, it was shipped to me on time and the packaging was in tact. The mirror is large enough to shave easily and it does not fog up as promised. The hook is sturdy and the razors have not come crashing down. The only thing that would make it look nicer is if it had a little border around the edge. I was given a sample of this product to give an unbiased review.", "The Fogless Shower Mirror is a different product. It is actually designed for men that want to shave in the shower. However, I think it works just as well for women that want to make sure they get all their face mask or make up off their face. This was the purpose of me using the Fogless Shower Mirror. I would make sure I got all my face mask off as well as my face wash products.The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror comes with a hook for the mirror as well as a hook for the razor. It is rather easy to install the hook for the mirror. I didn't even clean off my shower and it stuck... a little too well.I do have one complaint, now that I got the hook stuck on my shower wall, I can't get it off and it's quite frustrating. If you plan on leaving this up all the time, you'll have no issues. But if you want to remove it if say you have guests stay over, you'll probably have some issues.The mirror doesn't fog up, which actually surprised me that it didn't. Sometimes it would get a little distorted just because of the water getting on it.Overall, I do like the product and I most definitely would recommend it.I received the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror for free in exchange for my honest opinion.", "My husband and I both are loving this fogless mirror in our shower! He is loving for shaving in shower and I love it to use to make sure all mascara, makeup and shampoo is gone before I get out of the shower. It is true to its word, it does not fog up at all! It is nothing fancy but works like a charm!", "Cassandra's Review- Lightweight and easy to use this product does exactly what it is supposed to and should be applied exactly where you want it the first time.  I love how durable it is. You can also use this to find more then your face in the shower!I reviewed a complimentary product.", "This mirror works well and comes in very handy. And since it hangs from the hook, I can remove it to use after the shower too, since the rest of my bathroom mirrors are all fogged up by that point. As a lady, I didn't need this mirror for shaving, but I love it for washing my face, removing facial masks, or even tweezing my eyebrows. The razor hook works great for holding my tweezers too.Once in awhile when I take super hot showers, it does get a bit cloudy, but I just run it under the water for a second - as instructed by the company - and it's clear as crystal for the rest of the shower. Overall, I use it almost everyday and enjoy it.", "I honestly never even heard of a shower mirror before I tried this out. Living under a rock is rough business. I would totally recommend you eyeballing your placement of this mirror because after you stick it on I wouldn't advise trying to pull it back off. I honestly thought this thing would come crashing down after I put it up but one week later and it's still there where I put it.I think the hardest task would be trying to figure out where you want it without feeling awkward. I had placed mine close to the corner of my shower as you can see in the picture I posted ( Dark Brown Tiled shower). You know those creepy long haired Japanese horror ghosts? That's exactly what I felt like for a minute awkwardly staring at the corner of the shower but I quickly snapped out of that when I started to use it.I always wash my face in the shower with a cleanser so it was amazing to slather my product on making sure I filled every spot. I am blind as a bat so it was nice not to have to use echolocation ( more like touch and feel) to see everything.I am totally in love with this mirror but not I find myself looking in the mirror to scrutinize my face. The razor holder is pretty amazing too. It has a nice little backboard so my razor is no longer touching the yucky shower wall .I can't express to anyone reading this how much better my shower experience has become with this product. I definitely recommend getting one for yourself to experience this greatness firsthand.", "My husband enjoys this new little toy very much and agrees to everything the mirror promises above! The mirror really stays fog free in our hot steamy bathroom! The installation could not be any easier as the mirror comes with a wall mount you simply stick to the wall- no screws or drill needed! Super easy and it looks nice and sleek. It even comes with a little wall mount just for the razor.", "I love the Fogless Shower Mirror by Cassani. It is perfect for any man or father that loves to save time and shave inthe shower. When I received this item. I loved the design as well as how easy it is to instal int he shower. My husband loves it too! he said he is glad to have a mirror that doesn;t fog when in the shower. He likes that he can save time and kill two birds with one stone! Having this mirror in my shower keeps my counter and mirror clean with my husband no loger shaving at the sink! If you are looking for a great mirror for the shower! This is the one you want!", "This is great for the shower and has the ability to travel with you everywhere. This is also lightweight. Try one today.", "I received my mirror yesterday and I was impressed. It was very easy install and quick! It works perfect and the description is dead on. I highly recommend this for your shower!", "We gave the Cassini Fogless Shower Mirror along with a lot of other things that Newlyweds don't think of at our nephew's wedding about 2 weeks ago and I waited to do my review until he could tell me how he liked it. I already knew how it worked because we have a similar one already but I wanted his opinion, not mine on the actual way it worked for him.They both loved the convenience of the product and that the extra hook was there to keep track of his razor since he is about as forgetful as my husband, both can lose anything at any time. Plus it sure does save looking at all that mess in the sink!The nanotechnology that they use to keep the mirror from fogging up will also be an added bonus and you will appreciate that fact while you get an awesome shave in the shower without having to constantly wipe down the mirror to see where to shave.It's a very simple procedure to hang it up (about 2 minutes) and if I can do it, anyone can. It's very lightweight and not hard at all to hang up.", "Likes-Very lightweightIt comes with two hanging cord- one for the mirror; another one for the razorVery fast shippingIt is great for travel/student who live in DormDislikes-The mirror texture is not smooth/plain.I mean you can see the wave pattern kinda view on it.& I feel like it's kinda disturbing when you use it.It's not even a glass mirror. (made with plastic,paper)As I mention above, the view is not smooth. and I see many scratch mark on the mirror!The mirror shape is smaller than I thought!You can see the Fog on the mirror, while taking shower!!! (Failed!)", "I found the product to be superb and do exactly what has been  mentioned on the box as well. No issues of it falling off the wall with with the mounts having a strong adhesive. I love the fact that it has a hole on top to allow for the mirror to be placed back up on the wall or to take with you on the road. The fog didn't cause any blur on the mirror it just stayed crystal clear. I at first when received this product got scared it might be not as clear as a regular mirror except I was shocked to see that the mirror itself is as clear as every other mirror. However, this mirror has that special no fog coating.  Of course you can't wash it the same as any mirror, to prevent the removal of the coating. However, that's not a problem its a simple little wash with water or a dry towel and you'll be good to go.", "I got this kit  free in exchange for my honest opinion and all thought comments and opinions in this review are my own.First I must say I am impressed with the shipping and packing, the mirror was packed in the shelf packaging then in another plain brown box and finally packed into a bubble mailer manila envelope, this helped to ensure the item arrived in tack and undamaged. I placed my order late on the 16th and received my package in the mail on the 20th, four days from order to receive is very good timing.The mirror its self however when I first opened it I thought, looked cheep and I was skeptical of its quality however upon further inspection and research both online and with the product in hand I have found that I believe the product to be well made. the metal hooks for both the mirror and the razor are very sturdy and of a good size and quality they will not bend or warp easily the adhesive on the backs of the hooks is of a good quality as well and provides a strong hold. the installation process was very easy. I feel I could even purchase one for my teens bathroom and they could put it up with out a problem.I have already tested the mirror as well and ran the shower for more then 15min and even when my bathroom mirror was impossible to see in even with the bathroom fan running the cassani fogless mirror was clear.I think it will be a big help to reducing the yuck I have to clean from my sink when my husband shaves and it is the perfect size for both me and my husband to be able to see our entire faces in when we are in the shower. I used it to help with ensuring I removed all of the cleanser from my face and hair line and there was no problem seeing.Over all I am pleased with this mirror. The packaging and shipping time was very good the performance is good. The only thing I can say I have found so far about the Cassani fogless mirror that I do not like so well is that my first impression simply based on look and feel while holding it was cheep, but I am pleased to say after giving it a chance I do not believe it to be so. I would recommend this product if you are looking for an in shower mirror.", "After getting my new mirror all set up, I had to try it out right away. I am known to take very hot showers, so I was the perfect one to put this anti-fog mirror to the test. I am hooked, I swear if the water didn't start to get cold I could have stayed in the shower longer. I was able to wash my face, remove my makeup and do my eyebrow shaping...all in the shower! Never once did the mirror fog. I also love the razor hook, fits my razor perfectly (though I am sure my pink razor will be swapped out for my husbands when he gets home) After finishing my shower I always get dressed then put on my makeup. Usually I have to leave the door open for about 15 minuites while I wait for my $120 fogless makeup mirror to actually de-fog itself . Instead I just popped the shower door open and applied my makup using the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror. I am really considering getting another one for my bathroom wall to apply my makeup after showering. Overall I am in love with the in shower mirror, I don't know how I went to long without one of these.I recently was asked to review the Fogless Shower Mirror by Cassani Company and give my unbiased review.", "Great mirror to use outside of the shower as well. Like that it won't fog up in the shower. I also liked that I can use it for other stuff like waxing. This mirror gives me a close up look of my face that I can't get from other mirrors.Overall, if your looking for something that will give you a close up look of your face this mirror is for.Received complimentary, all opinions expressed here are my own", "I was pleasantly surprised that it came with shaving razor wall mount. It's just the perfect bonus accessory! Of course, I am too excited for Hubby to try it so I installed it in our shower immediately. The mirror is just the perfect size to clearly see the whole face and neck area for a cleaner, closer and easier shave. And the fact that it is shatterproof is just fantastic! I also love the stainless steel mirror wall mount and the stainless steel razor wall mount. I think they are very modern and sleekly-designed. Plus, they are very easy to install. But most of all, I just love that it is really FOGLESS!", "I reviewed the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror, in exchange for honest review from Tomoson.The product was easy to install. The kit comes with a mirror, a mirror holder, and a razor holder. The mirror also has protective plastic on top. You will need to remove the plastic covering. Then, you install the mounts/holders in your shower. The holders need to be placed where they will not get damaged or wet. To install the holders, you peel off the backing and affix to the shower wall for 45 seconds. The holders are made out of metal.To use the mirror, you need to hold each side for a few seconds under running hot water. Then, you can shave. I also used it to make sure I got all my clay masque off my face.I enjoyed using the product this week and will continue to use, even when my kid learn how to take down the mounts/holders.", "I Got this to try out and we loved it Shaving in the shower for my hubby has also helped a lot with his razor burn.  He used to do it over the sink with a electric razor not only did it make a huge mess but he would get the worse razor burn.  Now that he can shave in the shower the steam helps keep his face nice and moist and not nearly as much razor burn as before.", "Included in the box are 1 Shatter-proof Fogless Shower Mirror, 1 Stainless Steel Mirror Wall Mount, and 1 Shaving Razor Wall Mount, along with instructions and FAQs.Pros: The mirror itself is very lightweight and it's a good size. This product allows for reliable mounting along with the option to hang a razor and it has been easy to clean.So far, I have not experienced any cons. I haven't yet removed it from the shower wall, so I am not sure if any residue will remain upon doing so. I haven't used this product long enough to assess long-term fogless-ness, but so far, I have no complaints.Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.", "This product holds up well. (its been dropped a few times) Not a product flaw it has to do with my shower walls.  But no damage. (which i love!)  It does stay very clear and works well. My husband is happy with it also as it makes his life easier when he shaves in the shower. Thank you for a great product!", "This is seriously my new favorite part of my bathroom.Cassani's fogless shower mirror (with a hook for your razor) makes shaving in the shower safe, makeup removal foolproof (no more shower raccoon eyes!), eyebrow tweezing perfection, etc all WHILE in the shower! Mirror fog is a thing of the past when using this mirror in your shower!My man loved using this mirror for his shave and I loved getting my eye makeup all the way off in the shower because I could see!This mirror does everything they claim on amazon. I have had mine up for several days now and there is no fog in sight. I'm impressed and think you will be too.I received this product free in exchange for an honest review.", "This is a great product. Will allow my man to shave in the shower, and will let my brush my teeth as well. It is going to be fun for the toddler as well since it is not breakable like regular mirrors. Fast shipping, reasonable packaging. Great product for our bath!", "\"I like making sure I have all my make up off and this \"\"fogless shower mirror\"\" makes it so easy!  Also, if you color your hair at home, and rinse it out in the shower, you can make sure you have all the remaining color rinsed off your face/ears before getting out of the shower with this handy mirror that does not fog.  I was given this product at no charge in exchange for my honest opinion\"", "While I admit it is merely hearsay from my  hubster (I will have to take HIS word on it), this Fogless mirror is nifty and nice. As much as I love to look at myself in the mirror while shaving my legs, I decided he needed it more in his shower for a smooth and seamless shave. No more nicks and cuts for that guy!! He hung the mirror up, attached his razor to the hook and went on his merry way, clean shaven and well showered. A happy man.Who says a happy wife=a happy life. More like A happy man= yes, dear you CAN!  I definitely won some brownie points on this order. And I get to reap the benefits of a smooth shave, smooth cheeks and a kissable face. We will be paying great attention to  the cleaning cycle, and taking care of our shower mirror. We want it to have a long, happy existence in the Mr's shower and as part of his routine. A quality product for a quality man.  Easy to use, and no fog allowed."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04144134745001793, 0.04496847838163376, 0.03864424675703049, 0.045994941145181656, 0.04738122224807739, 0.04155414178967476, 0.04232870787382126, 0.04388763755559921, 0.030460579320788383, 0.04459233582019806, 0.03347158432006836, 0.024839818477630615, 0.039842963218688965, 0.03945138677954674, 0.04501104727387428, 0.02690030075609684, 0.042679622769355774, 0.04208582639694214, 0.033158980309963226, 0.04508398845791817, 0.030042460188269615, 0.03546951338648796, 0.02869204618036747, 0.04410179704427719, 0.029585126787424088, 0.03832987695932388]]}
