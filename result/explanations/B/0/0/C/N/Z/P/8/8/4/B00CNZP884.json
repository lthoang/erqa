We keep it in the rec room and whoever is down there simply pairs their iPhone or iPod and has wireless music!  If a call comes in, it also plays through the speaker.  My teenagers think it's cool and so do I - a very easy and handy way to play music.THE GOOD:+ Easy pairing: press and hold the power button until it tells you it's in pairing mode. Then have your device 'find' the speaker.  Takes seconds.+ It's 'voice' tells you when it's powering on, in speaker mode, what the battery power is, etc.  Nice for us middle-aged Moms who don't want to read teeny tiny writing.+ Calls can also go through the speaker, if you're using it and your phone rings.+ You can adjust volume on device or speaker.+ Rechargeable battery with charger cable.+ Apparently has NFC (tap) technology - though we don't have an NFC device.+ Decent sound.THE BAD:- Charger is USB-micro USB; if you want to charge it using a wall outlet (as opposed to your computer), you need an adapter.  This is not a big deal - so many devices come with these wall adapters that most households have a few lying around.- Decent sound which is fine for us, but perhaps not for audiophiles.BOTTOM LINE:  Easy to use, works exactly as it's meant to, really convenient way to listen to your device.", "I have a Jawbone Jambox - the Creative speaker is as good soundwise (lows/highs/volume)and matches battery performance (it actually charges a little faster than the jawbone jambox). The only downside I've found is that it's not as attractive as the Jambox - but hey, that's just a personal preference. It's sized between Jambox and big jambox. great to through in a bag and take to the beach.", "I've had the opportunity to handle a number of portable Bluetooth speakers, and will say this one is solidly mid-range. It has some features I like, and some I'm not so crazy about...PROS:+ 12 hour battery life is basically best-in-class. There are a couple other units that can match this, but none I've seen that can surpass it. This will be really nice for a full day at the pool / beach / lake or some other place where you want constant tunes, but don't have the luxury of a wall outlet+ Bluetooth connectivity to me is a MUST with portable speakers, and this has it+ standard micro-USB charger port means you'll be able to charge this many places, even if you forget the cord, because anyone with an Android phone will have the same charger attachmentCONS:- volume, at max, is rather underwhelming. It's good for a bedroom but isn't going to work for a party, or for outdoors unless you're sitting around a campfire or in a boat together- audio quality and clarity is okay, but doesn't really stand out among other similarly-priced units which have superior clarity and bass- for the volume / audio quality, it's rather large- power button is annoying. You have to hold it mashed down for an extended period of time to power it on, and then have to hold it down not once, but twice, for even longer, to turn it off. Sort of annoying having to mash a button for fifteen seconds to turn off your speaker. It's a minor annoyance (first world problems, I know) but something the designers should have noticed during product testing.- not weather resistant like some other unitsBOTTOM LINE: this unit is okay, but for the price, I can't really recommend it. Maybe for sixty - seventy bucks or so. Once you get around a hundred, the doors open for other units, like theLogitech Bluetooth Wireless Speakerfor a similar price. If you wanted to spend a little more dough, theTDK Life on Record A33 Wireless Weatherproof Speakerhas positively BOOMING audio and is rugged enough to withstand a sandy / misty environment, but costs more and has half the battery life. I'll leave it up to you, but my opinion is that there are better competing units out there for basically the same investment.", "The first time I played music through the Creative Labs Airwave, I was disappointed in the sound quality.  I also have theCreative ZiiSound D3x Bluetooth Wireless Speakerwith the  Wireless Subwoofer , and, because of the larger speakers, powered drivers, and added subwoofer, the sound is much better.  Of course, that combination is more expensive.  I also compared it to the tiny, battery-operatedGrace Digital ECOROX Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I liked the Grace Digital speaker sound quality more, despite its small size.  As I listened longer and more carefully to the Creative Labs Airwave, I began to realize that the radio-hiss quality I was hearing in the Airwave was really a lack of bass -- or more accurately, less boost to the lower ranges.  The result is a thinner, colder sound.I like that the speaker grill is tipped up, unlike most other Bluetooth and/or portable speakers which throw the sound straight out over the shelf or table they are sitting on.  And it talks when turning on, pairing, or checking battery status, something that adds little functionality but which is a little fun.  Pairing with both my iPhone and iPad was a cinch.  If you have an NFC device (I don't), you supposedly can pair it with a touch.  You can also answer a call with a touch.  The unit can be charged using the included USB cable attached to either your computer or to your own USB outlet plug.I am most concerned with the quality of the button construction.  To power off, you have to hold down the power button -- and mine went in and stayed there.  It is no longer flush with the top the way the volume button is.  Sometimes, I cannot get the unit to power off and, because it is battery powered, I can't simply pull the plug.  The quality issue is a small one for the manufacturer but a much larger one for the consumer.The Airwave is easy to use and very portable; however, I find that there are other better, albeit slightly more expensive, Bluetooth speaker options out there.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "I am using this speaker with my iPad.  After trying out some other brands including Nokia, I found that the Creative speaker is much loader and it is very easy to connect - even to the iPad that doesn't have NFC.  I do get 8-12 hours from a charge.  Overall, this is a loud speaker for the money.", "This is a nice looking speaker, with a few shortfalls:1. The unit doesn't come with a power supply, instead, they give you a USB cable which is good for charging the unit, but I would much rather have a power supply.2. You have to hold down the power button quite a long time (something like 8 seconds) to power on/off. The unit actually speaks to you (powering down)3. Pairing to Bluetooth is fairly easy; the range is not bad either.4. This unit says it has NFC, but I don't own a device that supports NFC.5. Sound is decent, but sometimes can sound like it's coming out of a cardboard box6. As far as I can tell, there's no good way to tell when you are running out of juice, so I try and charge it once a week (I use it in the bathroom so it doesn't get used a lot), which is a pain because as I mentioned previously, there's no power cable!All in all, for the price/features, nothing beats my JBL Flip.", "I struggle between 3 and 4 stars but overall this is a nice product.  It is well constructed and very easy to use (especially if your phone has NFC capabilities like the Galaxy S3).Set up is straight forward, just plug it into a USB outlet and it is ready to go.  Charge it overnight and you have hours of wireless usage available.  Sound is good but not great.  It is about the same as a decent desktop radio; loud enough, but somewhat thin.  I wish there was a way t increase the bass & treble on the unit, but I can modify this signal off my phone so I guess that will have to do.Nice size, I will use it when I travel so I have something to listen to at work or in the hotel rooms.", "\"I'm sad to say that the Creative Airwave's performance in my tests was disappointing.The unit is larger than I expected: about 10 by 4 by 4 inches. The triangular shape slopes the speaker slightly upwards which is an asset when the unit is on a table or desk top. The unit weighs about 2 pounds.On the top spine of the unit, is a multi-function indicator LED, a multi-function ON/OFF switch, a rocker switch for volume and a slightly recessed microphone. The controls felt mushy. No instruction manual was provided, though there is a pictograph of one on the \"\"What's In The Box\"\" listing.Bluetooth pairing was trouble-free. I have no NFC devices and couldn't test that feature.Sound quality was disappointing. It sounded like all the response was in the mid-range, lacking both bass and treble brightness. Oddly, when used with Skype, the audio was very badly distorted. I tested the built-in microphone with Skype's test call service and my spoken words were also distorted. I believe these problems are attributable to Skype.Bluetooth range was about 15 - 20 feet before the signal was lost. This was indoors with intervening walls. This relatively poor performance could be attributable to the laptop computer I was testing the Airwave with.There is an aux input jack to permit the use of non-Bluetooth devices.While I rank the Creative Airwave high for its design and ease-of-use, the sound quality and lack of range are disappointing. Battery life appears to be between 8 - 10 hours, which is pretty good, I think.Overall, this product strikes as adequate, but not outstanding.Jerry\"", "This Bluetooth speaker has some nice features:The triangle shape and geometric appearing front plate are different and attractive enough.  A rechargeable battery life of 12 hours is great.  There is a microphone for use as speakerphone with your cell or smartphone.While I have had some trouble pairing this with my relatively new Dell Windows 7 laptop, I suspect it is a Dell problem, not the speaker's problem.  There was no problem pairing it with an older Asus Vista laptop.  I also had no trouble connecting to an ancient LG flipphone.  When connected the speaker retains an even and uninterrupted connection to my laptop in the next room about 20 feet away.Turning on the speaker requires holding the button for 3 seconds, which can seem like an unnecessarily long time.  Turning off requires pressing the same button for an even longer time.  Also a bit on the irritating side is the loud beep when pressing the volume toggle buttons.  No beep or a softer one would be better.  Furthermore, you cannot press the toggle button quickly.  You must pause briefly between each push of the button.While I would not characterize the sound of this speaker as stunning, the Airwave speaker does sound pretty good for what it is, and it turns up loud enough to fill a room.  Overall, this is a nice portable Bluetooth speaker with some useful features.", "\"Pros:* Built in lithium ion battery (8-12 hrs) for true wireless experience* Can be used as a budget conference calling device* Excellent quality stereo and good bass for smaller spaces* Very light weight for transportingCons:* Power supply is not included (USB cable for powering is included)* Automatic power off after 15 minutes didn't always work on my unitEvery advertised feature was tested and worked fine (except for auto power off). I successfully paired and used this with my HP laptop, a two year old Android tablet, and a Blackberry 9300 Curve cell phone. NFC pairing was successfully done with a friend's HTC One cell phone.Nice feature: if you pair with a smartphone and you're streaming music incoming calls will temporarily suspend playing. With the built-in microphone you just have to push the \"\"Multifunction Button\"\" to start speaking. This feature also allows for a traditional conference calling setup which I tested with my Blackberry 9300 Curve. The quality of the sound of the call was crystal clear for me, and the microphone on the unit picked up my voice easily.I own a similar Creative Bluetooth speaker, theCreative D200 Bluetooth Wireless Speakerwhich is comparatively priced. Though the sound of the D200 seems superior to me, it requires an attached power supply. This Airwave speaker is TRULY wireless and physically untethered; I was able to get an easy 9 hours of continuous play with sound turned up at a moderate level. If you're thinking of packing this for a trip it takes up slightly less space than a shoebox (depending on the size of your shoes!).If you get an external power supply should it should have a USB port for the included cable, and be rated at 5V, 500mA though you can use one with higher amperage. My favorite is theAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet (2.1 Amp Output). The extra amperage is ok and makes it more universal with products that need more juice (such as a tablet). I did not test running this on a charger.This is really an excellent budget Bluetooth wireless speaker, but I have to knock 1 star for the \"\"hinkiness\"\" of the automatic power off. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I think I know why, but that's still not desirable behavior.\"", "This Bluetooth speaker has some nice features:The triangle shape and geometric appearing front plate are different and attractive enough.

The NSF pairing is nice, but it really drops the ball when it comes to audio quality, the sound seems very hollow. I have a Philips SoundShooter which is 1/5 the size, only has one speaker and seems to be louder and has better audio quality. I wouldn't recommend this, it's very large and for it's size doesn't have very good sound.", "This is a very average bluetooth speaker. It comes with a USB charging cable so that you can charge it up and place it anywhere. I think that's an okay idea, but the speaker is fairly large, so it is not really portable. I would rather it just have a normal AC adapter. It syncs using an NFC protocol, which does work fine once the speaker is turned on. The product manual says that you can turn the speaker on just by syncing it with the phone, but this has not been my experience. I've tried several times to get the speaker to turn on by swiping my phone over the NFC antenna and while the phone does beep indicating that it detects the signal, nothing else happens. The speaker does not turn on and the phone does not sync. Once I turned the speaker power on it works, though.The sound is just okay. I'm not an audio expert, but even to my ear it is a bit hollow, especially at higher volumes. I've had other smaller, less expensive speakers that worked better.I think this product is fine, but not great. The size and shape don't really lend to the claimed portability and the NFC does not work as described, at least not with my Samsung Galaxy Note II. The sound is just okay and even kind of bad as it gets louder.", "Well I am listening to some Pleasant music while writing this  review using the Creative  Airwave....First let me say this is a bigger unit that I expected.. I was expecting a sm size about the size of a hotdog bun... well this is no hotdog.. It has some weight and size to it..More like a large Hoagie sanwich!!.. In a rather odd triangle shape.. not unappealing but not what one expects.. All my previous speakers have been square or long rectangles. The button's for operation are clearly visable on the top of the unit and easy to access.. It also has a VOICE response when you are starting up the unit  and when you are pairing.. this is the first  bluetooth speaker that I have had that actually does that.Now for the good part..Pairing was a breeze.. I do not have a NFC device so  I used the traditional pairing method.. and I was up and running in less than one minute. But with the NFC on this unit it would make it even easier.As for the sound, it  produces sounds that are quite pleasing..with extra humph on volume.. Perfect for an outdoor event ,or a large room indoors..  The unit allows for  voice  conference phone calls if that would be something that would be needed..  One thing I do like it allows for a music playing unit to connect to this speaker even if that unit is NOT Bluetooth capable.( few bluetooth speakers have the port for this activity)..Now the sounds we tested were all sorts of music: Broadway tunes, classical, country western,  hard rock and spoken word i.e. Audio Books... all passed with good results.. Nothing super outstanding but more than average.I would say  mid range..in tone with a good Base.I have quite a variety of blue tooth speakers to compare this with so I am and unbiased  listener..  I took this outside on the pool deck and it was more than Pleasant in that setting.The battery life seems more than adequate for me.. approx 8-9 hrs.. ( swimming pool deck time)... It played like a trouper the whole time. The literature that came w the unit indicates 12hrs of run time.. I haven't had it playing that long but for my test 8-9 hr window was more than I expected.I feel this speaker is more suited to the casual music listener ( which is MOST PEOPLE)... not the audiophile..This speaker  prob would not pass their exacting standards.. but the average person would feel this is a great speaker and be Most pleased to own and use it regularly ...... I know I will.", "\"This device works well as a bluetooth speaker phone solution, but music reproduction is lackluster. For it's size I expected more bass - not rattle your bones bass, but at least some depth and definition to a bass guitar or kick drum. Treble is weak and not very crisp either. Midrange performance is clear, but lacks presence. If you primarily listen to podcasts, this might  be a good option. The smallerHMDX Jam Plus Portable Speakerwhile not as loud, sounds far superior and is much more portable.As speaker phone, this device works very well even with multiple people talking in the same room. If I am the only person talking, people generally do not realize I'm on a speaker phone. It was very easy to pair with my iPhone 5 and has better range than a lot of bluetooth devices.Battery life is very good but at 10\"\" wide and 4\"\" high  and over 2 lbs it's not prohibitively large for travel but there are smaller, better options.\"", "For the price point, these are great speakers but I do want to note that I think that this looks a little cheap when you're close up. I think they could have improved in that dept. From a distance, it looks fine.This is lighter than I honestly thought it'd be. I guess I just imagined it to be heavier.I hooked this up to my Droid DNA and it was oddly easy. I seem to be electronically challenged but I got it on the first try.I played it in my house for about 3 hours and it was still alive. I had it in the living room and could still hear it well in my bedroom and from my daughters room.I also want to note that I have purchased many Creative items all with fairly good luck, I think it's a solid product.", "I have a much larger bluetooth speaker from Creative that is a few years old.  I have been carrying it into the bathroom every mornng, so I wanted something smaller that could just stay in there.  While this speaker isn't tiny, it is a lot smaller than my old speaker and works like a charm.While I don't own an NFC device, this is the first product that has given me a reason to want one.  Pairing is pretty easy using my iPhone, but I think touching the two together would be a lot easier.  The cool thing about this unit is the vocal responses you get with certain process.  The best part of this is when you use it unplugged, you can tap on the button a couple times and the voice will tell you the battery power that is left.  Also, I have used it unplugged for a few days and it always shuts off.  I haven't timed it, but I would expect it to be out of power if it wasn't working properly. (edit:  I wanted to mention that I think it shuts off because I take my iPhone to work with me.  I noticed that when I use it at night, I need to turn off bluetooth on my iPhone or the two will continue to communicate.  I think this is what you would want from the speaker so you would have it available at all times after you have paired it to the iPhone.  Unfortunately, if you are using the speaker unplugged (running it off of the battery), it will run down the battery if you have the iPhone paired with it, even when you aren't playing anything.)The main downside is that there is not a power adapter included.  They do have a really nice USB cable, but you need a computer or usb wall charger to charge it.  This may be the first gadget I have purchased that doesn't have a way to plug it in to a socket.  As a result, I knocked a point off from my review. I also don't like the way the bluetooth light blinks when it is paired.  It is a minor annoyance the way I use it, but it some cases, I could see it being a bigger problem.
