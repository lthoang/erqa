I tried using it on my wavy/curly hair and didn't see a particular result one way or another.I did see a lot of sticky white powder on my hands and clothes. Warning: Do not wear black when applying this stuff!I'm not sure if the reason for all the powder is because of the design of the container itself or the fact that its hard to tell how much powder to use. The powder comes in a tiny can-like bottle that is about two inches in height. On the top it has a pepper shaker like grill that allowed the powder to come out.I like the idea of attempting to use the powder, but I think I'll stick to pomades and gels that yield results and that are less messy from now on.", "I always like anything that helps create volume, but it is important for me that the product does not feel sticky, greasy and make my hair feel dirty. Unfortunately, this Toni&Guy powder did leave my hair feeling a bit dirty and without volume, despite that it does give a light hold. I personally would not buy it. Sorry. :-(", "I put the powder on the roots of my hair with just a little shake of the container. You don't need much to add volume. The package also claims that it helps with oily hair-which I believe is true. My straight hair always needs some type of product to add volume. Although this powder does that, it also leaves a very matte unpleasant feel to my hair. (I just used a little) I have better results with Dirt by Jonathon for extra help. Maybe others would like this matte feel, but it made my feel like my hair was dirty.", "This product works.  It is two ingredients in total.  I like simple.  So it gets props for being simple.  It contains simply Silica Silyate  and water.  Period.  Silica Silyate is an oil absorber that will help lift your hair and give it body.  To me it feels a little weird, but what hair products that give body don't feel a little weird?  This product doesn't seem to cause any adverse effects.I knock this one star because it is overpriced for such an inexpensive ingredient.According to my limited internet research, silica silylate raises no health concern because:It is not on any of GoodGuide's lists of toxic chemicals which cause suspected or recognized health effectsIt has not been detected in human tissue or urineIt is not a high production volume chemical that lacks safety data", "I have short, chin length hair and was hoping to be able to take this product on an international trip in lieu of my standard gel and curling products. After trying the product for a few times, I've decided that not only does it fall short on giving me the ability to style my hair, it is extremely hard to wash it out.The sculpting powder I a fine powder that comes in a talc-style container. It seems to either not come out of the container holes or come out in clumps. It is a very sticky substance, so once out of the container you will end up getting it on the roots and the rest of your hair. The powder does help with adding volume to your hair, but at the expense of a necessary thorough hair washing afterwards (sometimes multiple soaping).In a pinch, this powder may be a good product to use, but, given the difficulty of removal combined with giving your hair a matte look, I  do not foresee using this product in the future.  I will continue to travel with my other hair products even though they take up more space in my suitcase.", "This didn't do anything for my hair.  It was like I didn't use anything on it.  The powder is small, and hard to get out of the tube.  There are several small holes, and you really have to shake it to get anything out.  The instructions say to shake it on your roots, but you can't see if anything substantial is coming out when you shake it directly on your hair.  I tried putting it on my hands, and it seemed to disappear, so it looked like I didn't have anything on them.  After all this work, I didn't notice anything different with my hair.  Perhaps I didn't use enough, I don't know.  Since it was really hard to get anything to come out of the tube, it's hard to tell how much actually did come out.  I didn't notice that it was hard to wash out, but like others were saying, my shampoo won't lather when washing my hair after using this.  I won't be ordering it again, or recommending it to anyone.", "This fine powder does provide for a nice hold, but it also leaves a sticky residue on the hair and hands.  While the hands can be quickly washed off, the powder in the hair can not.  One still needs a good hairspray on top of the powder to maintain a hold, so I don't under stand the purpose of this.  The one good thing is that the container is small and best for travelers.", "Although I ordered this product, I never received it. I do like the concept and like that it can help fine hair to appear thicker. Hoping I will eventually get the product - I'd love to try it.", "This is strange stuff.  It feels irresponsible to recommend it or to allow oneself to be recommended to it.This powder is silica silicate and a very small amount of water.  That's it, all of it 100%.  It's a small tube but will go further than appearance makes one expect while surely being cheaper per ounce if marketed in larger quantities.  To be direct, the ingredients are quite simple.Whatever your hair looks like, you can make it look like a lot more with this power.  I did.  But I hate the way it feels on my hands.  I hate the taste that sticks on the roof of my mouth until I use strong mouthwash.  Somehow the fine powder reaches to one's mouth and nose.  I hate having to shampoo it out because it don't come out easy.One needs skill.  The trick is to learn to apply it evenly and at the same time get it as close to the scalp as possible.  Not easy since it's a fine powder that wafts and sticks to the first thing it comes into contact with.I think if this were to be added to some dye, some color, that it could be dangerous.", "My hair may be the perfect candidate for this product. It is very fine and neither thick or thin. I wear it in a short  shag and because volume can be an issue, I get a trim every three weeks.This is designed to be applied at the roots. It works pretty well, but not without issues. This is described as a fine powder. True enough, but it a powder that can be used sparingly. The problem is that it also clumps in the container. If you can't get the amount of powder out of the container that you need, this product is useless.I currently use a light mousse that essentially gives me the same amount of volume. I won't be using this product in the future.", "I hate this stuff. It's messy and explodes all in the air when I try to use it. I've used similar type products in the past and didn't like them either but this one is the worse. It is a powder and it just explodes all in the air when I try to use it and just seems to stay and float around forever.I also think it gums up the hair. I really don't like the texture that it provides. It also has a weird sticky finish to it. I just don't like it.", "From my wife's perspective:I've been using this product along with the Toni & Guy voluming plumping whip, so I might be getting some better results than other people reviewing the product. I should specify; I use the plumping whip after I shower on my damp hair. I use the sculpting powder the next day to extend my shampoo. The sculpting powder says it creates a matte finish. I use it as a dry shampoo.My hair is shoulder length, thin, flat, and professionally colored. This product is very fine, almost like dry snow flakes. They dissolve on contact with my scalp. So you need to watch how much you tap out of the bottle or you might get sections where you have placed no product, but think you did. Parting my hair at different sections, I tap the product directly from the bottle onto my scalp. Once I've applied it on all desired parts I massage it in with my fingers. I have noticed some extra volume that wouldn't be there on day old hair. As I stated, I have not been using the product on its own. Some reviews stated they had a hard time shampooing out this product. I have not found that to be true. But depending on how many/much hair product a person uses, they might need to add in a weekly wash with a clarifying shampoo to their hair routine.If you are already using a mousse or voluming cream, I think this sculpting powder can help extend the length of time you get volume. As I stated, I use it as a dry shampoo. If you are just using this on clean hair as a styling product on its own with no additional product, you might not get your desired results.", "Okay, after I got this I looked this product up and it states on the Amazon site:Creates volume and texture for a lived-in lookAdds a matte finish to hairShape hair to your desired styleMicro-fine powder absorbs instantlyOkay, this sculpting powder does create some volume and texture for thinner hair or hair that needs a little bulk. Not sure about the &#34;lived-in&#34; look--what is that anyhow?Yes, it does add a matte finish to your hair, but I felt not in a good way. It looked dirty at the roots.I was able to bulk up my hair from the roots to give it volume.HOWEVER, like other reviewers it was hard to tell what was coming out of the small bottle and how much! The first day I used it my hair was sticky and it looked like I had dandruff. I kept brushing my hair and using a cloth, then damp cloth on it. The second day I used the product my hair was still sticky, but it seemed as though I had managed the amount better and I no longer looked as though I had dandruff. The stuff needed a little extra shampooing to wash out too.The directions are not the best so if there is a proper way to use this stuff I certainly didn't find it.I love hair products and buy them frequently, but I truly don't understand why this stuff was manufactured.", "\"As noted by other reviewers, when I removed the incredibly small tube from the box, it was dusty ... and instantly became \"\"tacky.\"\" And, I will admit, while I was astonished at the price-tag slapped on such a miniscule product, I was truly confounded when I tried to use it. For me, when I opened the top and attempted to pour a small amount into my hand, NOTHING came out. I then realized that the tube has virtually no weight ... and then I became very much concerned that I was shipped an empty tube. Nonetheless, my hands quickly became sticky and I realized that this product may dispense extremely fine particles. (????) I ran my hands through my hair as directed. And, while I ended up with some fantastic volume, my dark hair looked dull and somewhat gray. I thoroughly brushed my hair ... no difference. Dull and gray. I experimented with this again this morning ... virtually NOTHING came out of this TINY, TINY tube (think around the size of a bulky lipstick). I have no idea if this is an issue of humidity (it is not terribly humid right now in Pennsylvania AND I had it in my linen closet, away from the steam of the bathroom). I have no clue what the problem is or how to proceed.Perhaps if the instructions were more explicit (ex. \"\"very, very little product will be dispensed, but it will go a very, very long way\"\"), perhaps if there were a warning on the package (ex. \"\"keep out of sunlight, do not store in a medicine cabinet\"\") ... maybe then I would not STILL be thinking I was shipped a nearly empty tube of \"\"gray hair.\"\" As of now ... this is the best I can guess.UPDATE: as also pointed out by several reviewers ... when I tried to wash the second attempt out of my hair tonight, my usual shampoo had almost no lather and my hair was \"\"clumpy.\"\" It took me THREE washes with my boyfriend's Head and Shoulders just to get this product out. UGH! Prepare for a project just to get your hair clean.\"", "\"And that is the name I would give this product. The 18 year old in the family is into grooming. Sculpting his hair to the style he wants is what it is all about (and going to college in September). His feedback: it works exactly as described, it adds volume without crunch you get when using styling mouse (although it felt like cotton candy), his hands were tacky after using them to style his hair, washing it out can't be done with a 2 in 1 product so he shampooed his hair once - rinsed -- shampoo again, rinsed and then used conditioner.from the Tony&Guy; website: Dust directly at the roots of dry hair and scrunch together with fingers or work through the lengths and ends of an up-do for texture and light hold. Or for extra lift, sprinkle on the crown before backcombing. Micro-fine powder creates volume and shape great for achieving a laid back \"\"lived in\"\" look. With a weightless texture, it absorbs instantly into the hair giving bounce and texture.I got the scoop on the one ingredient Silica Silylate from a web page for Dow Corning:  Dow Corning VM 2270 Aerogel Fine Particles Aerogel silica silylate is a thickener, sebum absorber and impacts the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Corning Products> Soft Solid Antiperspirant> Pressed Powder> Foundation> Oil-in-Water Facial Cream> Face & Body and Sunscreen> Color Cosmetics> Arctic Defense Body Cream> Sun Protective Serum> Marzipan Souffl&eacute;> Silky Feel Hydrogel\"", "This is some magic powder.  Notice how much is included here, .035 ounces, so this is a very small bottle.  When you start using it, if you get any on your hands at all, you'll probably regret it.  You'll want to go directly in your hair and then try to avoid touching it.  It makes your hair very 'sculptable', but it is kind of a pain to get out.If you must get your hair in a certain way this will work great, just at a cost of getting it out later.", "I have used several brands of sculpting powder. This one is pretty much what you'd expect. The powder feels oddly damp when you sprinkle it on but acts completely dry. You want to shake this into the roots of your hair. It gives texture and fluffs it up. It works as well as I would expect.My only complaint is that it isn't invisible. You can see the powder in your hair.", "For use prior to styling, in order to add volume, my wife has not found anything better. This has now become a new favorite, but it doesn't take much. Her hair can lay pretty flat without use of rollers (lots of work) or hairspray (hates the crunchy feel). She had never used sculpting powder before and is now hooked.There are quite a few reviews complaining of it being difficult to wash out. I suspect that these reviewers are usng too much. There are four small holes on the top; we use only two to help have only minimal amount come out. Using it about 3 times a week, we suspect that this will last 6-12 months.Highly recommended.", "This definitely weighs my hair down and feels greasy to the touch around roots, and no matter how much I avoid my roots when applying it always seems to work its way back up to them within hours.  Extremely hard to wash out afterwards, just not worth it for me personally.  I have naturally curly/wavy shoulder length hair, very thick.  This might be better for someone with thinner hair.", "OK, maybe it is my age but I found this hard to use. It doesn't shake out of the container well. This just didn't work for me. It wasn't user friendly.", "We're still testing out this sculpting powder.  For the most part it seems like a good and useful product.  I would say that it has more hold than most products... which can be bad.  I mean, if you want light hold that washes out easily then maybe this isn't good for you.Anyway it seems to work very well and we've had no real issues.", "This is great stuff for fine hair. You sprinkle it at the roots and you get that lift when your hair is just the right time from being washed to have lift but not too dirty that it falls limp or cannot be styled. It is unfragranced, a plus, and I have not noticed any &#34;dandruff&#34; from it.The best part is that it is not only compact, it doesn't count against the one quart baggie of liquids and gels! Perfect!", "So you have to handle this product with care- If you don't lightly dust a lot will come out- Sloppy packaging..  I have really thin hair.. Applying after my hair is dry, in the roots and work through it does give my hair some body and make it easy to sculpt. There are other products out there that work better, but this works well- Just be careful, and don't put too much on and you will get good results!", "I've used volumizing powders for a while now.  They are good to give a really tousled, wild or messy 'bed head' look, an 80's hair look, or, more importantly, to really pull off some CosPlay type effects on my own hair, or sometimes wigs.  (I like to do witches and updo type characters, like Yubaba, to give you an idea.)It's a great aid to teasing.  Yes, it's going to be hard to wash out- I think every kind I try has been - it's just the nature of what you are putting in your hair.  BUT, it will help hold up even very long heavy hair if you get it right.  The way I do it, I make sure the container is open ALL THE WAY, and I actually tap it ON my head, not above my head.  Then I take my fingers and scrunch it in to that area, and move on.  When I'm done, I give myself an imaginary 'dry shampoo' and then start to style.Use it on DRY hair.  IF you are going to tease very long hair, go ahead and get your section out, and you can add a bit directly to the roots of that section.Use WITH hair spray - I like Got2Bs freezing spray for really constructed hair.  If I just want a bit of everyday volume or help making an updo look fuller without a using a hair doughnut, I don't mess with spray, so it feels more natural.I have always had my hair feel dirty after the 2nd day using all the powders I have tried, but even dry shampoo is like that for me- it's a bit like that.  It seems like at first these silica and starches soak up oil and add volume, but later they just feel sticky and dirty.I like Redkin best, and Got2Be is also a better powder better than this one.  They come out of the little container easier, which is very important in a product like this - but they look like they are all made of the same stuff.  I give this 3 stars, because I do prefer Got2Be which is less expensive.", "I tested this on my dark, curly hair and my mother's highlighted straight hair.Results were okay, but not remarkable.  Did give a nice &#34;messy&#34; bed-head look, but did not provide much volume, especially on straight hair.  Also, unfortunately, the product tends to make darker hair looks not just matte but dull, somewhat like when using a dry shampoo designed for lighter hair.  The residue can leave with an almost gray looking tinge (not optimal).This product creates it's own messy theme in your hair, and leaves you out of control of the project (but, with curly hair, the hair is always in control anyway).Overall, it's not a bad product, though, just disappointing.  I would recommend it for people with lighter brown (or lighter than lighter brown) hair who, along with sculpting and mattifying, are only seeking a little extra volume.  If you need lots of volume boost, this won't be enough &#34;oomph.&#34;", "This sculpting powder works ok but it was difficult to shake out and the ingredients don't merit the price. It looks Ok in the hair but is a bit tricky in washing it out. Not the best product on the market.", "My long fine hair is usually pretty flat with no oomph so this product seemed like a great solution to obtain lift at the roots. Overall I was pleased with the results. Lifting sections of hair and holding the open container close to my roots, To obtain some hair height, I shook out a small amount and immediately rubbed the powder on my scalp dragging a bit up an inch or so into my hair, while scrunching the that area for a bit of lift.The time spent on styling was only a couple of minutes, but once done I discovered that even a wide-toothed comb immediately stuck into areas I was attempting to lightly smooth almost as if the hair had been teased, so the next time I used it I made sure the hair looked the way I wanted it before moving on to the next area.Matte hair is not a look I want - I like shiny - so using a hair clip I kept some top strands away from the powder so I could comb them over when I was done applying the powder. I used very little product and did not have a problem with clumping, perhaps because I live in a dry climate.It worked well but I did not like the feel on my hands, the sticky feel in my hair or the extra rinse and repeat shampoo procedure necessary to get the product out. Also, I would hesitate to shake the powder onto my hands as a means of applying it to my hair simply because the dust goes everywhere and breathing it in does not seem like a good idea. So, although I won't use this sculpting powder daily, it is definitely something I will periodically use when seeking a particular look.", "I was anxious to use this product to see if I could get a little more &#34;umph&#34; in my hair.  The first day I tried it I had trouble shaking it out of the container but got enough to rub into the roots and work through my hair.  The instructions said if you wanted more body to back comb.  My thought is that with back combing you get extra volume with or without this product.  I also noticed that when I finished rubbing the powder into my hair my hands felt sticky and gluey - not like when you apply regular baby powder or Bond's body powder.The second day was rainy and wet in Southern California.  When I opened the shaker NOTHING came out at all.  I banged the tube on the counter but except for a few flakes could not get anything.  I went so far as to pry open the top and when I did there was just a big clump of powder inside.  I guess you have to live in the desert to get this product to work.I'll not be using this again nor would I recommend it.", "I find it hard to recommend hair products that are tedious to use, especially if their results are not drastically better than all of the competition. This sculpting powder does not do anything better than any other product you might ever think of using to style your hair. After giving it a couple tries, I can safely say that this product is not worth the trouble.It's hard to apply and even harder to wash out. The powder is dispensed in a fashion that gives you very little idea of how much you really need to use. Less is more is generally a good idea when it comes to most hair products and I found that I should use even less than that when it came to this powder.Using this stuff will significantly increase your shower time. It's very hard to remove. I do not recommend this product.", "I could not detectably notice much difference in my hair texture, or anything else, after using the Toni&Guy; Casual Sculpting Powder. The powder did remove some of the shine, but my hair doesn't have much oily shine any more as I am an older user of this product.Recommend with caveats given.", "I was suspicious when I ordered this product. I was afraid of it turning into a gross paste in my hair and, well, although it may not have turned into a paste it sure felt like it.It's pretty gross and took a few days to wash out of my hair. Won't go down that road again. *trash*", "I love hair sculpting powder. It is perfect for my fine (but abundant) short hair that gets weighed down quickly. However, this powder was too light. It didn't weigh down my hair but it also didn't hold it. I put in an excessive amount compared to what I use of most sculpting powders and it just didn't hold.
