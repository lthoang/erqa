It is very easy to setup and the subwoofer connects wirelessly and automatically.The sound is very good although not mind-blowing or anything like that.  I'm not an audiophile so I don't have any expert recommendations or comments to make in that regard, but to a regular person who values quality sound it sounds good to my ears.The optical cable included is very lightweight and short.  I had to get a longer one for my setup.  I never found any kind of users guide but it is pretty intuitive to use.  Not much too it.  My main problem was figuring out how to set the clock.All in all this seems to be a very good system and I can easily recommend it.", "This surround sound performs as expected with a clear sound and it was a breeze to set up. We use it with a Samsung flat panel television that has better than average sound output, so this was just to boost the sound for movies and football games (which my husband loves to do...)We have a built-in entertainment center in our house and the subwoofer works well in the speaker-cabinet under the television. I prefer to keep all components of surround sound out of sight - the only sense I want to be stimulated is my hearing, not my eyesight. As this subwoofer is also a bit unsightly it we did not mount the sound-bar to the wall, as suggested. We first tried to put it in front of the tv and under the screen, but had difficulties with it staying up as it would fall eventually because of the sound coming from the bar vibrated it right off the sloped base of the television. We then were able to stash it in the back of the tv with little difference in performance. We noticed that if we pull open the subwoofer cabinet and have the sound bar out, we can lower the volume by one or two - not a huge deal and worth it to keep the system out of sight. The performance of this unit is on-par with the price and I would recommend.", "\"This Pinnacle system is my first experience with a soundbar system.  I decided to install it in our bedroom to go along with a 42\"\" Panasonic TV.  The system is easy to install- first you need to connect the soundbar to your TV.  I used an optical connection, which is the preferred method.  Then you just plug in the soundbar to the power outlet, and also plug in the subwoofer.  The subwoofer connects easily to the soundbar via Bluetooth, so it doesn't need to be directly next to the soundbar.  This gives you some nice flexibility.The sound quality is solid.  There are some preset sound fields such as TV, movie, game, sport, music, large hall, and small hall.  I typically chose TV for my viewing, as it enhanced the sound without adding too much bass.  If you want to be heavy on bass and sound effects, choose the movie setting.  I played around with the other settings but none of them stood out.  While sound quality is not nearly as good as the 5.1 system in my living room, it does work well for a bedroom or small room set-up.  But I'd recommend a traditional 5.1 system if you are able to do it.I do have to admit the included remote was a big issue for me.  I found that it had limited range.  Even at short range, it sometimes took multiple pushes to get something to work, which was very frustrating.  I knew I would go crazy if I had to use this remote to control the soundbar, so I looked to adding the soundbar to my DirecTV universal remote.  Unfortunately, DirecTV remotes aren't set up properly to add the soundbar as a supported device (the Pinnacle website has a full list of supported remotes).  Luckily, I had a spare Logitech remote sitting around, and used that.  Tip: when using Logitech software, you'll notice there is no \"\"soundbar\"\" category.  You'll have to go to \"\"amplifiers\"\" and add it that way.  Once I did that, I had no problems controlling the volume using the Logitech remote.A few other issues I noticed:- There is a clock on the soundbar that runs fast.  I fixed and noticed it running fast again.  The clock display can be bright at night, but fortunately you can turn the display off.- Powering the soundbar off does not power the subwoofer off.  For some reason, the subwoofer will blink a blue light (probably because it is looking to pair with the soundbar).  The blue light got annoying at night, but I covered it up with a piece of paper.- If you manually turn down the volume to zero, it still plays sound (appears to be at the same volume as \"\"01\"\").  So you will need to hit the Mute button to eliminate all sound.Despite these issues, I like the soundbar and will continue to use it in my bedroom.\"", "\"Placed in context, which I failed to do out of the box, this soundbar/sub-woofer system should be a satisfactory choice for most budget minded users however not necessarily the direction I would take with mid to upper scale priced HDTVs. It's not going to compare favorably with higher end competitive units let alone 5.1(2)/7.1(2) Home Theater systems with a full-fledged A/V receiver.Regardless of the bloated MSRP, as an entry level soundbar system intended to supplant the typically under-performing internal speakers of economy to moderately priced TVs, or offer an alternative where space for external speakers is at a premium, the Pinnacle system can certainly meet the need although I would have liked to have seen HDMI and Bluetooth capability as features on this unit as it is with some other soundbars that fall within the entry level price range like theSony HTCT260 Sound Bar Home Theater System. It is also represented on the manufacturer's website as an Amazon exclusive, which gives me a little pause yet with the 36 month warranty there does seem to be degree  of security ALTHOUGH within the pages of the owner's manual I received and this system is not listed specifically, the limited warranty for other systems sold by the manufacturer is 24 months.The soundbar is 39 1/4\"\" in width, has a 12V power supply and is recommended for use with TVs  37\"\" or above. It can be attached to a source device by the provided one meter Toslink Optical cable, RCA cable or RCA adapter for use with a TV headphone jack.  It is has one digital input and three auxiliary stereo inputs so a maximum of four devices can be ported to it at the same time if necessary. I tried all three connection options with the Toslink method proving to be vastly superior although if wall mounting is desired it is likely a longer cable will be required. The `in the box' provisions also include wall mount brackets, screws and a very convenient wall mount template.With the RCA cables and RCA adapter I encountered a low level background hum that was noticeable with in each input source I tried (two standard definition TVs, portable DVD player, iPod). If I didn't have the capability to employ the Toslink connection I would have lowered my overall rating because of the buzz or hum. So, although the system can be used with most video or audio devices, audio quality will be affected in some instances and if internal speakers cannot be disabled on the source device only the RCA adapter option worked for me although the quick start instructions state turning source volume to the lowest level is supposed to work with the Toslink connection.The LED front panel with clock has a mid blue illuminated hue and touch keys for power, pairing with Bluetooth sub-woofer, volume, mute, input source, listening mode. These selections along with the additional keys for adjustment of sub-woofer output levels and front panel display brightness are also accessible via the infrared remote control (batteries included).  The system is compatible with Logitech Harmony remotes.  There were other remotes listed but after seeing that my universal was included I stopped paying attention.Internally, the black matte finished PBAR features according to published documentation  a 1\"\" tweeter and three 1.75\"\" woofers per side. I'm no expert so what exactly a 1.75 woofer is, I don't know. The soundbar is rated up to 160 watts total RMS. I don't know about the whole surround sound claim because while modulation over a 39\"\" bar in synch with a detached sub-woofer might result in some aspects of sound immersion I don't feel it manages to achieve true surround sound. It is an improvement over internally housed TV speakers but with essentially two output locations it is not going to overwhelm more demanding  listeners.The black vinyl finish with glossy top sub-woofer with 18V power supply is also rated to 160 watts RMS and features two 5 1/4\"\" bass woofers in a push/pull compound compression configuration. As far as size is concerned the cabinet 7 1/8\"\" Wide x 11 1/2\"\" High x 12\"\" Deep. The sub-woofer cabinet has a base positioned power switch with red LED indicator lamp, Bluetooth indicator lamp and pairing key although to this point it has paired automatically each time the devices simultaneously turned on.  It has circuitry that will activate/deactivate the sub-woofer whenever soundbar power state changes, another nice feature.Recommended sub-woofer placement is a few inches from a wall in a left or right corner of the listening area or along a front wall near the soundbar to optimize blending  so naturally I placed it in the middle of wall in the back of the room opposite but within broadcast range of the soundbar.  FWIW, I am more impressed with the efficiency of the sub-woofer than the soundbar unit. While build factor is not on par with my present Home Theater system sub-woofer, in terms of output I would not be opposed to using it in my primary setup if the need arose...if it had wired capability (which it does not). Published specifications indicate it has a maximum SPL (Sound Pressure Level) of 112dB and to date I haven't encountered distortion even at maximum sub-woofer output levels as I have noticed at higher volume outputs from the soundbar itself.I didn't have a soundbar previously so in terms of audio quality  ONLY,  I compared the system to three similarly priced wireless speakers I have available: Boston Acoustics MC200Air Wireless Speaker System for AirPlay, Logitech UE Air and  Pure VL-61998 Jongo S3 Wireless Speaker with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  The first two speakers are single enclosures like the soundbar (not factoring in the sub-woofer) while the third unit is a dual speaker set. Individual perceptions and sensitivities will vary but for my preferences, the Pinnacle system was least impressive as in higher frequency ranges distortion was much more noticeable than with any of the other three units. Even with consideration of the wireless (Bluetooth) sub-woofer that I like, in my opinion the Pinnacle system was not a significant improvement over the single enclosure Logitech UE.For each audio or video source I sampled (streaming from Pandora , Netflix or Amazon Instant Video over Roku and/or  Apple TV - Jazz channels or HD video; cable TV channels; standard DVD movies, CDs and MP3s) only one mode setting (sports) available on with the Pinnacle system resulted in composite tonality I was happy with.  With the absence of a genuine equalizer function, the user is restricted to identifying which pre-assigned mode output is preferable for different sources and none of the remaining 7 choices were sufficient for me with any source as each selection seemed to require an overall higher volume setting to hear dialogue clearly, was deficient or tinny with treble or lacked  requisite clarity. It also wouldn't hurt to put some kind of voltage output indicator on the top of the two power supplies as well as the underside label for the benefit of pre-emptors like me who rip open the box and start hooking up stuff since they look identical.As a result, if the primary objective is economically minded enhancement of the home theater experience, this system can meet the desire but if expectations are greater investment in a somewhat more efficient and most likely, more expensive mid-level sound system would be a better choice.\"", "\"I've been using this speaker system in my family room for nearly a month, now, and the sound is quite good. I have never cranked the volume up any higher than 50%, and I have not experienced any distortion at those levels. Generally, I have these speakers set at about 35-40% volume, and that is plenty loud for movies, music, or TV in my average-sized family room. The TV I connected it to is a 42\"\" Samsung HDTV that is about three years old. I easily connected the speakers to the TV by way of the included optical cable (though you can attach it to a TV in other ways, as well, the optical cable would be the easiest and preferred method on most modern TVs).From the time I took the speakers out of the box until the time I tested them out watching scenes fromIron Man 2 [HD], only about 20 minutes had transpired. That's a pretty easy installation, in my opinion. The speakers come with wall mount hardware and a mounting template, but I do not have a great place to mount them, unfortunately. Instead, the speakers are resting right at the base of my TV in its nook in the corner. Unlike sound bars from many other manufacturers, this particular sound bar has a somewhat smaller footprint at just under 40\"\". I can appreciate this, as my TV nook is only about 42\"\" wide. Most typical sound bars would not fit in this space, but this one fit perfectly.The sound bar has several different modes of sound play: standard, music, movie, sports, etc. I found the \"\"Music\"\" option to be most to my liking, so I've left it on that option for all viewing.I have a few quibbles about this product. For one, I think the MSRP on this item is outrageous. Just because something has an expensive price tag doesn't mean it's the best quality. MySony HT-CT660 46-Inch Sound Bar with Wireless Subwooferproduced a sharper sound than this product, had better packaging, better instructions, and seemed to be composed of higher-quality materials than this unit but was tagged with a lower MSRP. I think the MSRP on the Pinnacle speaker set is AT LEAST $100 too high. My second quibble is with the included remote control. I've found that if I am standing more than six feet away from the speakers, I can't reliably count on the sound bar receiving the signal. This makes the remote control a bit of a joke, as I usually have to get up and walk towards the speakers to get them to receive the signal from the remote. Aside from those issues, I have found that these are great speakers that are worth owning if you can get them at a reasonable price.\"", "Set up was easy. Parts are clearly labeled where necessary. If you are going to wall mount it includes a cardboard guide to take the guess work and measuring out of the bracket placement.In my case table/stand  placement was a better solution. The legs keep it stable but I could have used a few more inches in their height. Needed the bar to go across the base of the TV which is also placed on the stand.There are separate volume controls for the main unit and the sub-woofer. Also some acoustic  pre-sets on the remote. There are choices for the  connection cable to the TV as well . In my case I used the digitalMy Visio had decent sound before adding the Sound Bar but it has GREAT sound now. For example the storm segments inLife of Pi [Blu-ray 3D] sounded like the storm was happening in my living room.  Considering Amazon's current price is 70% off list It's a bargain as well.Highly Recommended!", "\"We have never had a home theater system, so we were pretty excited to be offered this product to review.  The soundbar is snazzy looking and looks great with our 42\"\" flat TV and other black DVR boxes/DVD players etc.  It was pretty easy to hook into the TV - we used the digital cable.  It was a little tricky to figure out how to change the settings on our TV to make it work, but it wasn't too bad.  It was not automatic, and I do kind of wish that it would tell the TV when it was on and off, so that the TVs speakers would work if it was off instead having to be turned on and off manually, but I guess that requires brand pairing with our panasonic TV.We placed it right under the TV on top of our boxes, and conveniently the two little wall brackets that it comes with worked out just right to use like feet for us to level it on the boxes which are not equal heights with some sort of \"\"official\"\" look.  The subwoofer is nearby and paired simply and automatically.  It does power down eventually and then you can just turn it off and on again and it will repair.As far as sound, I am not a huge audiophile, just a lay person who thinks it is cool.  We have been enjoying the better sound overall, but it really showed it's worth the other day when my daughter had a titanic sleepover party.  We paired up the subwoofer and put it on Movie mode and it was pretty amazing.  Especially given that our entertainment center is in the corner of large room with a huge open wall and not at all optimally laid out for sound.  During the dramatic parts the walls shook (in a good way) and the kids though it was just awesome.It's also really easy to put the headphone jack wire into the AUX1 slot and pop in an ipod for great house or party music and the TV doesn't need to be on to do this.. just a handy, great sounding ipod/mp3 player.The two small annoyances about this product is that it has to be turned on and off separately from the television so now we have one remote for the FIOS and one remove for volume and muting.  It doesn't bother me so much but my husband finds it irritating.  Also, and I can't explain this at all... the clock doesn't keep time.  We set it, and it runs slow.  After 5 days, it is one day and 5 hours behind.  Pretty weird.  I can't imagine why that would happen.Overall, this is an easy product to use, and not too expensive if you just want to boost up your sound quality without a complex and pricey system.\"", "Tried this system with a TV that had a great picture but poor sound quality. The setup took 2 minutes. Used the analog output from TV. The unit paired with the sub-woofer across the room within a few seconds. There are are 8 sound presets with different equalization, and the sub-woofer volume can be varied independently of the main volume. The sound is very good, and can be turned up quite loud without noticeable distortion. There is a convenient MUTE button on the remote. The speaker bar can be attached to the wall (hardware provided), but we have it placed directly in front of the TV, as it also can be used that way. Seems to be a well-designed system.", "I am not an expert, but I do enjoy good audio and the sense of dimensionality surround sound can bring. The Pinnacle PBAR 2.1 is easy to set up, sounds great and fills my rather large family room with rich tones. It is excellent for music, making even digital files sound warm and natural.With movies, the PBAR vastly improves my TV's audio, but it doesn't come across as &#34;true&#34; surround sound. Happily, that wasn't what I wanted - I had no interest in setting up five speakers, a subwoofer, and running wires along the walls. I wanted something simple to install that would make my movie watching and game playing more enjoyable.The PBAR met and exceeded my expectations. For the price, its a a great bargain and a simple solution for someone looking to improve their listening experience.", "\"The Pinnacle PBAR 2.1 system has some nice features but overall I can't recommend this product nor do I think it's a good value.First the good: relatively easy to set up, the bar speaker is LIGHT which is great for ease of mounting, the wireless connection to the subwoofer paired up relatively easy, and the display has a nice dimmer switch so it doesn't get too bright.Unfortunately there are some sound issues which I must report.  First off, of course there is no surround sound here but even sounds stemming from video that move left to right (or vice versa) don't really move across the bar well (think Death Star trench run).  The system has a large enough sound for a bedroom or small living room but not enough for a home theater or large shared den/kitchen/living room.  Also, there is no equalizer, just different modes.  Unfortunately when watching a movie, \"\"movie\"\" mode is completely useless because dialogue is too drowned out.  I tested this system with Avatar on Blue Ray and I literally could not watch the film in any mode but \"\"sports\"\" because it sounded like they were all whispering.  \"\"Sports\"\" mode is ok but it can be tinny at higher volumes.  Also, the unit close up looks somewhat plastic like and chintzy.\"", "\"This is my first experience with Pinnacle products and I'm impressed! The sound quality is much better than I expected, and the system offers a lot of features that similar soundbars don't offer. It's also backed by a 3 year warranty, which is hard to find these days.I appreciate the 8 modes so that I can adjust the sound based on what I'm listening to. There really is a noticeable difference in each mode. I was surprised to see an Opera mode provided. This mode seems to emphasize the voice in music, so it would be perfect for operas. I generally chose music or movie modes. Each mode sounds rich and full, and exceeded my expectations.The soundbar is a good size, measuring 39 inches long and 3 1/2 inches high. This is a smidgen taller than other soundbars that I've looked at. The center of the bar contains a clock, which is something that I did not expect, and it's useful to me. It's only visible when the soundbar is powered on.The subwoofer is a little smaller than most, measuring 7 1/8\"\" wide x 11 1/2\"\" high x 12\"\" deep. Despite the smaller size, the subwoofer sounds deep and rich. There are two speakers inside that face each other, creating a more powerful sound through \"\"push-pull compression configuration\"\". In other words, it really thumps!I'm glad that this system offers multiple connection options. I had another soundbar system that only offered a digital optical connection, so it did not work with everything I wanted to connect to it. This one offers the optical connection as well as RCA and headphone connections. It should work with everything!I'm very pleased with this system, but there are two things that I wish were different.*The remote control operates the soundbar and allows you to adjust the subwoofer volume, but does not turn the subwoofer on and off. The subwoofer goes on standby if you don't flip the switch, and the blue light flashes occasionally like a beacon. It's a little annoying, so I turn it off manually.*The subwoofer has a glossy black top which could scratch easily. It's attractive, but I have to dust it every day because dust is very visible on it. It also seems to be a magnet for chihuahua hair. I would much prefer a matte finish on top.OVERALL I am very happy with the Pinnacle PBAR 72-320 system. The sound is very good and the components appear to be very good quality.  I would definitely recommend this system to my closest friends and family members.\"", "And I am definitely a non-technical person!It arrived well packed and double boxed.  I took everything out, removed all the packing and then read the instructions and proceeded to follow them.  I have a 42&#34; Honeywell flatscreen tv that has pretty good sound, but as I watch a LOT of action and scifi movies I was curious about how it would sound with the Pinnacle PBAR.It might not be surround sound, but I can tell you until I did some adjusting and figured out the best settings for my room, I'll bet the neighbors heard quite a bit of the movie, Pacific Rim! lol!!I am thoroughly enjoying it!", "\"For my entire adult life I've used a stereo receiver and full speaker compliment. For the last several years I've been limited to a center channel speaker, two front speakers and a subwoofer, but I still like the sound.I picked this speaker set with the intent of putting it on the bedroom TV, and was quite pleased  when I saw it came with a mounting template for the wall to go under the set.However - then my main stereo deck of the last 8 years pretty much died, so this speaker system got an immediate promotion to the Home entertainment center. I assumed that I would have it here for a while until I found a suitable replacement for the living room.Well - after a couple of weeks, I've decided it might just stay.The speaker bar is the perfect size to fit in the space underneath my TV, so the level is down low. The description says easy to set up,and it was for the most part. It came with cables, which is nice if you have just moved in and don't have any, but I didn't particularly care for the slightly cumbersome remote.I have just two inputs set up - the optical input and one aux in. There is where it falls a bit short. I would have REALLY appreciated a second digital input, whether it be an optical or a digital coax input. I have my TV going to the digital, and I have no issues, but the computer output (which I use for BlueRay and streaming some movies) going to what is basically a headphone jack, sounds a bit tinny to my ears. It just seems cheap to me that there aren't two options for a digital input (and perhaps 2 less 1/8\"\" plug analog inputs).Speaking of feeling cheap- - the construction is not what I'm used to in speakers and audio gear. The light plastic, even with the subwoofer, makes the set feel cheap during initial setup (but on the bright side, that means it's awfully light when mounting on the wall).I never bothered to read the instructions until I tried to marry up the subwoofer. Which for their advertised ease-in-setup, should be a small demerit.The sound though is impressive coming from a piece of plastic on the shelf. It's loud, and when the subwoofer is working, it's quite impressive. There are several different audio modes to choose from, including Cinema, Sport, Game, Small Hall, Larger Hall and Opera - but we usually turn it to generic TV mode and leave it at that. The only draw back is that we lost the remote within the first 10 minutes of having this thing, and I can't set the clock on the speaker (EDIT: this can be set from the front panel of the speaker).After a while of use, I'm not totally convinced that I'll switch to this permanently, but even if it does go to the bedroom, it will sound great. I do wish I had this at my last house where we had the home theater room in a much smaller space for the kids. This would have had a BOOMING sound and fit perfectly as an alternative to a full-blown speaker system and a huge improvement over the TV speakers.So because of the good, clear and loud sound I give it four stars. It has a couple off quirks, but the basic job of playing music/sound with a full bass and sharp trebles, it does well. Being light and almost portable can also be a plus. The 3 separate analog inputs while only one digital seems ridiculous and was clearly a cost-cutting mode. I suppose some people might connect an iPod this way, and two more analog inputs??It's nice. We'll get a lot of use out of it - I just don't think it's perfect, but if the price is right, I would definitely recommend it for a setup where you'll just be connecting it to a single TV.\"", "First of all, let me say that I'm guessing I got a faulty unit or something because when I feed it a Dolby Digital signal, it makes this horrible crackling and popping sound.  As soon as I send it just a standard stereo signal, it sounds great.  I'm using this downstairs in my game room with my Xbox and so I don't really need surround sound like I would for a movie, so it's not a big enough deal for me to go through the hassle of returning it.  I will say that it more than fills the room with plenty of rich sound--MUCH better than the TV speakers could ever do and without all the bulk of a receiver and satellite speakers.  I've also fed it some bass tracks as a test and this unit held its own very well.  Having said that, though, you're going to get a much better surround experience from real surround speakers.  In fairness, I'm not feeding this a 5.1 signal (because I can't for the reason listed above) but even with stereo sound, I'm not really getting the amount of auditory spacial perception you would expect with the real thing.  No surprise there.ALSO, the remote is super finicky.  I've found that it often doesn't work until I shake it or open it up and jiggle the batteries around.  Loose connection, or something.  That's a little annoying but once again, I can usually just set the volume I want and call it good, so it's not enough for me to deal with the hassle of boxing it back up and taking it to a delivery store (UPS, FedEx, etc.).If I thought these problems were likely to be common for all of these units, I'd give it 2 stars.  It deserves at least that even with the annoyances because it does sound very good in stereo mode for the price listed.  I am convinced, however, that I got a bad unit and they don't all do this; I could be wrong, but it seems like such a blaring problem that they would have noticed and fixed it before shipping if it was the norm.  On the other hand, I can't rate it higher than 3 given my personal experience with it.Personally, I prefer the sound that actual surround speakers provide, so if you have the space and budget, I'd totally recommend you do that instead.  On the other hand, if you don't have the space and/or don't want to run a bunch of wires all over, then you might consider an option such as this.  The sound won't be AS good, but it isn't bad.  If you want a nice, quick, easy set up with all the wires you will need provided in the kit (which this has) and if money is an issue AND if you are willing to play the return game if your unit is acting weird, then I'd recommend product.  The sound is big, rich and full and I think for the vast majority of users who do not already have a full surround sound system, it will be more than good enough.Now that I think about it, I think this would make a really good unit for users who want just music in a single room and have a place the can put both the bar and the sub.  Hmmm... that's not a bad idea... maybe I'll have to move this upstairs..."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00873284786939621, 0.0005187620990909636, 7.885475497459993e-05, 0.001748329377733171, 0.009292994625866413, 0.22394965589046478, 0.0023082152474671602, 0.16664263606071472, 0.01815463975071907, 0.05734177306294441, 0.25916051864624023, 0.058782413601875305, 0.0015408806502819061, 0.19174747169017792]]}
