It updated to the new Google TV version that is trying to unify all Android devices.  This changed a lot of how the unit works, I have not seen many new apps that are in the Play store that I care about, and my biggest problem is with Chrome.  Chrome has changed to a Android phone/tablet version that the TV channels detect as a mobile device and say you cannot watch on it (you can use desktop mode to get around this), however, Flash is GONE!  There is no Flash support anymore and I cannot watch any Flash videos (like fox.com, nbc.com...) they will not play (the unit had Flash support before).  I can now close apps (have to use a strange swipe motion with the remote's mouse; like you would on Android ICS), which is nice.  Some good things of the update is that the Video and Sounds improved greatly (do not know how, but they are amazing sounding/looking now; way better than before, which was already really good).  For the most part everything else is the same, the pop up menu in live TV mode is now different and requires an extra step to get to DVD/Record options; but I programmed the color buttons on the back for these functions.The TV will bug you about updating, so you will probably have to, but you will lose Flash which is really not cool.  Hopefully, LG or Google will realize this is not a good thing and will add it back to Chrome in Google TV, or somehow have a way where you can install it from Adobe (I tried, it detects the TV and says Not Supported); but I will give credit for the improved video/audio.UPDATE:I watched the DVD version of Oz the Great and Powerful last night and decided to turn on the 2D to 3D conversion, it was great!  I have found that the 2D to 3D conversion works great on movies that were made in 3D (I get most of my movies from Netflix [DVD] so watching great 3D movies on a budget is not easy since I cannot afford to purchase all of the disks that I want to see on 3D and Netflix does not rent out 3D Blu-Ray [to my knowledge]).  I have tried the 2D to 3D conversion on other stuff and it works, but is not amazing 3D effects, but movies that were originally in 3D look great even when watching the DVD version!UPDATE:My problem with the UP arrow and UP roller were found to be a problem with the Remote control, I called LG and they sent me a new Remote for free and it arrived quickly!  Their was no problems at all and the representative was super helpful and once the problem was found to be the remote sent a new one for free [Warranty].UPDATE:I had a hard time getting Google TV to work with my HTPC (Windows 7 x64).  I finally got it!!!  --This is not the fault of the TV, but instead me trying to do something that it is not completely meant to do.  I finally got it, and here is how in case you also want the Google TV system to control your HTPC (and use only one remote).  I was able to get it by telling the system I was using a TIVO for my DVR (I used Remote Code: 1817, and I found using generic codes did not work, since it would think that multiply buttons were the same [send same code to Windows]) and Broadcast Service for my zip code.  I than used a program called Intelliremote (I tried EventGhost, but it would go idle on my system and stop responding to remote commands) and used the MCE template to match the buttons (to control Media Center actions, their is also support for XBMC and a few others, and you can make your own). You will also need to Disable the HID Access in Services.msc.  I matched each button (using Learn Code) and it worked!  With the exception of two buttons (GREEN and RED), I programmed all the buttons to match what I wanted for my TV (as well as a few remote commands that can be sent from the onscreen menu).  Now once they fix the bug in Primetime I can use it.  I now only have to use one remote for everything.  I just thought this might help anyone trying to use Windows Media Center as a DVR with this TV.The Bug in Primetime I mentioned should only affect you if you are using OTA.  It sends the channel number to the DVR as a number (for example 10), however OTA sends it all with a decimal (WMC reads in as a decimal, but you could program it as a dash if needed).  When you use Primetime to go to a channel, say 10.2, it only sends the 10.  Which WMC ignores and does not change the channel.  I have reported this to LG and they said they are sending it on to Google (I tried to report to Google, but could not find anyway to send it to them).  This should not affect if you use Satellite or Cable (since they do not use the decimal, to my knowledge)First off, my setup.  I have this TV, a HTPC (HDMI, Windows Media Center OTA broadcasting) PS3 (HDMI), Wii (Component Cable), PS2 (Composite Cable), AV Receiver (Optical Out), Roku (HDMI) -- With all that Google TV offers I have stopped using Roku.SetupI got this TV and took it out of the box (super easy to do, since you open top of box, remove everything but the TV (stand, remote, cables, 3D glasses, instructions), than you can lift the top of the box up and the bottom will stay with the TV.  Than the TV can just lift out of the bottom cardboard and styrofoam.  I took the TV and put it on a  bed (with wrapping in place, so I could put the stand on it; the bed is nice since it is soft and the over lay allows the stand to be off the bed and at a height that you can easily work.  I put the stand parts together (four screws) and than put the base on the TV (four screws, but be sure to slide the stand on the top notches or it will not be right).  I than brought it back to the living room and put it on top of my electric fireplace. -- This TV does not look it due to its size, but it is really heavy.  I had a hard time lifting it and moving it (also because of its size it is hard to hold (without touching screen).  I put it on their and the stand is very solid and the TV feels super safe (the stand looked a little strange on the picture and I was worried about it, but it is super sturdy).I turned it on and the LG logo shows up and it was super sharp and gorgeous colors.  The Google TV setup wizard type walkthrough appeared and asked simple questions that I followed and got the TV setup.  I use Windows Media Center (Win7) with OTA (antenna) broadcast TV, I setup my system with that setting.  I have an AV Receiver, but I prefer not to leave it on all the time, so I only use it for music and movies, and the Optical Out on the TV allows me to do it with the DTS and Dolby Digital passthrough and have theater quality sound when I want it.Also, I enabled the Quick on setting to make it turn on instantly when I turn it on (about 2 seconds) vs the normal of around 20-30 seconds.  This setting is off by default and is presented in the Setup Wizard at first start or in Settings.I want to note that while it has plenty of HDMI ports it only has one Component and one Composite.  However, it technically only has one of both type.  The TV panel has a 3.5mm looking jack connection for Component and Composite.  The TV came with an adapter for it.  However, the Component does not have Sound and instead uses the Composite's input for sound.  So I have my Wii (Component) hooked in, but the PS2 can only have video, no sound.  I am going to go get an RCA jack splitter (one for the RED and one for the WHITE sound cables) and than have the Component Video hooked to the Component port, Composite Video (YELLOW) hooked to the Composite port and the AUDIO (RED and WHITE) from both split to share the Composite Audio in (Since I will never have both on at the same time, it should work fine).  However, I just wanted to note that, since it appears that you can use Component and Composite you can only use Component or Composite, since they are share Audio.  This is was kind of irritating, since their are still a lot of great devices that use Composite or Component (Wii and PS2 for example)...TV Service SetupThe TV setup was easy and the TV found all my TV channels (I went in and removed a few that it found that I do not have), and than the hard part (not related to the TV).  I had to get the LG remote to control my HTPC (Windows 7).  I used a program called EventGhost that allowed me to record the commands from the LG IR blaster and EventGhost triggers an action when it gets that (since all tasks in Windows Media Center can be performed with a keyboard, I set up each task to trigger a keyboard event).  This took forever due to the problems I kept running into HID services triggering duplicate events, IR signals Debouncing, I finally got it to work by enabling MCE Remote (Vista/7) and MCE Remote (old) on the same system, the Vista/7 model enabled the service for passthrough of IR signals and the older version of it created three IR signals that had different codes for each event and I just created a trigger for the first one received (this took a while since I had to create it for every single button that controls the device; if you are using anything other than a computer (HTPC) you should not have this problem and can pick your remote/device provider from the list provided, but if you are using an HTPC I thought this might help you.To let you know, since it is a tad confusion on how it works.  Here is how the Google TV system connects to your Input devices (in my case my HTPC, acting as a DVR/Guide for OTA TV).  The IR blaster sends the IR signals to your device, the IR signals include launching DVR (recorded content), Live TV, Guide (for provider guide), channel numbers, and other commands.  When you tell it DVR (menu or back DVR button on remote) it sends the IR signal to the device, the same with all other functions.  When you use Primetime for the guide it sends the channel number to the device using IR (I have found that for OTA it does not send the decimal or dash; Windows Media Center uses a period, so I programmed the DASH button on the remote (only non number that seems to send an IR blast) as a period, but Primetime does not seem to send a dash or anything, it just sends the number (for example 10.2, is sent as 10), and the HTPC just ignores it since it is not valid.  So at this point I cannot use Primetime (it has a cool look and looks promising.  I will report the issue to Google and LG and maybe an update will fix it).  I have verified that it does not send anything but the first number (using an IR console, I saw it send three commands, which I have previously programmed.  For going to channel 49.1, it send a 4, 9, ENTER.  WIthout a dash or period it will not tune to a channel.  If you have cable/satellite it should not be a problem since it has no dash/period.  Also, when I setup I saw all the cable providers and Satellite providers in my area as choices for TV service, so you should be good.DisplayThe screen is gorgeous and is near edgeless (about a quarter to half an inch on the sides), the colors are vibrant and the picture is just amazing.  Make sure to rerun any Display setups on your devices to ensure that it changes to proper 1080p and the proper settings for this display.  --If you are using a HTPC or computer, you might find that their is  a large (about 2 inches) on each side of the screen not being used.  To fix this go into your graphics driver's program (I went into Catalyst since i am using ATI) and look for a setting like My Flat Panels.  In there you will seen an option called scaling, click on it and you will see a slider that you can adjust.  I set mine to 0 and it now fills the entire screen!3DTo test out 3D I purchased Avatar in 3D.  The 3D was amazing, I will say it is very close to Theater quality.  Movies with more action and popping out stuff is cooler, but Avatar had a neat feel to it that sort of engulfed you into the picture.  Their was no tossing stuff at you, but spears and fire seemed to just come at you and the bugs and floating things (from the tree of souls or life) seemed to be almost in the living room.  The 3D glasses are really nice and you get 4 of them.  They do not require power and are very similar (if not the same) as the type you get at the theater.  They have a comfy fit and cover your whole viewing (wide lenses) and you do not even realize you have them on.  While watching Avatar I tried to increase the 3D depth, but after some research found that you cannot, the Depth slider is just for 2D-3D conversion.  I did enable 3D color enhancement which seemed to make it more vibrant since the 3D glasses darkened it up a bit.  The 2D to 3D is also pretty cool, but I find that it mostly just makes text on the screen come out.  If something has a lot of  action it works better, but it is not something you should expect to use often.  Some shows/movies it works great on, others it does not seem to; I do recommend turning up depth all the way, that is a great improvement on the 2D to 3D.  Also, when I turned on the PS3 after connecting the TV it popped up saying it detects a 3D TV and asked to enable 3D I said yes, and now when running 3D movies or games it automatically goes to 3D and the TV says to Put on Glasses (easy setup and works great)!!AudioThis TV has 2.1 audio.  However, you would never guess it.  The TV has Virtual Surround and sounds amazing.  When I do not have my surround sound on (actual AV Receiver) it sound like I do since you can heard numerous distinctive channels.  You do have to set it up right, go to Settings and find the Audio and set it up.  You will have to play with it and get that sweet spot for you.  You can also enable Virtual Surround in their.  The sound is not that loud as my old TV, but if you have it on about 70 you can hear it great (with fans on; I am in South Georgia and it is hot right now; without fans 30-40 is great).  It does seem to change sound intensity based on channels (I think some channels have HD sounds and others do not), but it is not a big difference.  The virtual surround is amazing and this TV puts off great surround effects without even using the AV Receiver.  I do use the AV Receiver for movies and music, and the AV Receiver can use DTS, Dolby Digital, and Multi Channel Stereo through the passthrough of the Optical Out.Google TVThis is my first Google TV, I used to have a Roku (still have it hooked up, but find I am not using it).  The Google TV has Netflix, Amazon, Crackle and a few others preinstalled.  You can add more from the Google Play Store (at this time Hulu Plus is not there, I do not use Hulu Plus, so it does not matter to me.  Their are options, so you can find some ways to get Hulu.  I personally use Hulu Desktop on my HTPC).  Their are not as many Google TV apps out their as you would hope, but for the most part the main ones are their.  You do not seem to be able to load any Android app on the TV (for some reason I thought you could; I am sure their are ways, but I am not trying any with a TV).  Their are probably going to be more apps showing up if Google TV becomes more popular and the inclusion of it in some big brand TVs might help it take off.  However, this is a TV and for the most part you are not going to be using a lot of non streaming apps (other than radio and news).  If you go to Google Play and Search for Google TV you will see most apps have the phrase for Google TV in their title.  The ones you will actually use are their and you can always use Chrome for other tasks.  The Chrome browser works great (before you try, Hulu will block it for full episodes, it will appear to work and than \"\"Hello, we notice that you are trying to access Hulu from Google TV.  It is not available, but we are working hard to bring our Hulu Plus Subscription service to Google TV\"\").The Primetime and show search functions work nicely and you can see what episodes are free (through Netflix) or can be bought from Amazon Instant VIdeo.  I wish they would add the Prime Content of Amazon Instant Video to the list of Free shows in the search and Primetime areas.  You can easily open the Apps from the Home page of Google TV and change what apps are shown where (bottom bar and Top Apps).  You also have Widgets that can display stuff you care about (I have my weather and news on the home page).  The Google Play store on the Google TV works great, and only shows Google TV Apps (so if you wander why some are missing, that is why).  Their are many apps and they change all the time, and more are added to the Google Play store.  I have actually found that I do not need my Roku anymore, since I can stream everything on Google TV and it looks just as good (if not better).  You can also surf a full web using Chrome (it has Flash support), and the remote mouse works nicely and is easy to use.Also, to let you know, I checked in the settings and found that it has 5GB of storage for Apps and other stuff.RemoteThe remote is cool, the QWERTY keyboard is nice and it feels well made.  However, it is the weakest link in this TV (although this is an amazing TV, so this remote is still pretty awesome).  The remote's shape is like a phone (width and height), it is just a tad longer than my iPhone 5.  It is pretty fat on one end, but still fits naturally in your hand.  The keyboard is nice and has most characters that you would expect.  The only thing I would change on the QWERTY keyboard is the FN keys.  They are this dark maroon red and unless you have a lot of light, they are hard to see.  I wish they had better contrast, since it is hard to see.  I also wish that the dash or period (my HTPC uses a period for channel numbers), but the period button (FN + L) does not send an IR signal, instead the DASH (FN + S) sends a dash (I programmed Intelliremote to read that as a period).  However, I think that should have been a main button, since if you have OTA you will use the DASH/PERIOD a lot since all channel numbers have it.The front of the remote is simple and has the main buttons that you use.  The Power button and Input button are clear and the voice, Guide, Back, Home, Menu, Mouse, 3D, Channel, Volume, Mute, and DVR functions are easy to press.  I also like the 2D-3D button being on here.  However, I wish they had included the STOP button (I programmed the Yellow (FN + INFO) on my TV to STOP programs).  I also wish the DVR, Live TV and Info button were on the front (they are on the back), but they are most used buttons in my opinion (you can get to the buttons by pressing Menu on the front and an onscreen option is present).  The DVR Controls are nice, but I do like the Skip (skip ahead 30 seconds or back 15 seconds), those are not present, but I can live with that.  For IR controls, you can program most of the obvious buttons on the front, and on the back you can use the Numbers, DASH, INFO, DVR, and color buttons (RED,GREEN,YELLOW,BLUE) and the arrow keys, Enter, Backspace and ESC do the same as their front counterpart (ESC is BACK).  Once you get used to the remote layout and use it is easy to use and you will not have much problem.The voice search is nice and the Integration with YouTube and Chrome allows you to find nearly anything.  You can also find stuff in Primetime and launch Apps.  It is very good and I have not had any issue with it not recognizing my voice.  Just remember that it does not stop what you are watching when you do it.  So you may want to pause before doing it if you are watching something you care about (it does mute it).The remote is pretty cool.  However, I have found two annoying problems.  [UPDATE: The UP and Scroll UP are actually a defect with my Remote, I contacted LG and they are replacing the remote, see update below] The UP button on the front does not seem to work when you press it lightly (like the other directional buttons) and the scroll going up keeps tossing me down, I find you have to press a little harder on it for it to recognize (maybe it the way I hold it...).  Secondly, sometimes the remote does not seem to respond.  I think it might take a second to repair with the TV (since it is BlueTooth), and I press a button and it does not do anything, I am not sure if I should do it again or wait (I raised the volume of alerts in the Settings since the sound takes place before the action for big changes (like going Home).SummaryIn the end this TV is amazing.  The picture quality is amazing, the streaming content and integration between content and devices is amazing and it works flawlessly.  3D is amazing and glasses are comfy and cover your whole line of sight, and enhancements with Google TV are limitless and the future apps can always keep you watching new stuff.  Like all full features devices their are some quirks, and some stuff that does not fit all (for example, I had to do a lot of work to get my HTPC to work with this).  However, once you get it all setup, you will find you only need one remote for most devices (still have a remote for the PS3, since it is BlueTooth) and you can stream straight from the TV without any other devices.  Their are a few changes I would like to see and a few bug fixes that need attention, but since this is Android based it can receive updates (in fact I had an update when I first got it; updates are painless and take about 10 minutes).If you are looking for a full feature TV that offers everything and can do it all, than this is what you want.  The Google TV platform is growing and had some hiccups along the way, but with the quality I have seen here it has the potential to be big!  I look forward to seeing what new apps and features this offers in the future and Hope to see Primetime fixed soon for OTA users.Highly recommend this TV!!!!UPDATE on Remote:My problem with the remote control turned out to be a problem with the Remote hardware.  I called LG and explained the hard to press UP button and the scroll ball's problem going up (goes up a little and than shoots back to the bottom of a page or list), and they said that the remote sounds defective.  He said they are sending me a replacement remote control (under warranty).  So if you have this problem it is a problem with the remote and warranty will replace it.  Also, the LG customer service was super kind and fixed the problem on the first call with little effort on my part.  LG has excellent customer service and great policies on how they handle warranty replacements.\"", "\"This LG 47 inch \"\"Google TV\"\" is one of the nicer TVs I have seen recently.I am using this TV solely using the internet sources (aka Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc.).  I don't have a cable box or antenna hooked up to this.  The internet sources work great and with a fast internet connection, you forget easily that you're not using cable or satellite.  The TV software is fast and reliable, so you can pretty much eliminate the use of any external sources such as a PlayStation, XBOX, Roku, or Apple TV.  Though one notable app that is missing in the TV is Hulu Plus.  So if you rely on Hulu Plus, you'll probably still need another source to use that.  I am not a big fan of the mouse remote or keyboard, however.  I'm not sure I would recommend this TV for web browsing purposes, which is what it is somewhat marketed for.The image quality of the TV is bright and clear, with accurate color rendering.  The picture is sharp even when viewed at a pretty close distance.  Again, this is when using the internet sources.I only tested the 3D feature once for the purpose of this review.  The 3D effect does really work and \"\"pops out\"\" the image.  LG includes glasses with the TV, and the nice thing about them is they are not battery powered.  So you don't have to worry about replacing batteries, and you can get more glasses for cheap.  Personally, I am not a fan of 3D TV yet so I haven't used this feature since my one test.The only CON with this TV that I have found so far is that the automatic backlight adjustment is lousy.  The TV is supposed to automatically dim when you are watching in the dark, but mine did not.  One night, I tried watching a movie when I had a corner table lamp on in the room and nothing else.  The lamp was next to me, so it was still bright in the room.  The TV dimmed itself significantly to the point that I could barely see the picture.  Turning on the main room lights caused it to brighten up.  Turning OFF ALL the lights kept the screen very bright.  As soon as I turned on the corner lamp again, the TV dimmed once again.  I ended up turning off this feature in the settings.Comparing this with my other TV, a 2011 Sony 46NX720, the LG is mostly superior to the Sony.  I would highly recommend this TV.\"", "\"I got this TV a few weeks ago, and have been really enjoying having it. I was not in the market for a new TV, but I am definitely really glad that I got this one. Below are some of my experiences and observations thus far. I may add some more info as I get to know this TV more in the upcoming years.***** Setup *****Despite it being a fairly big 47\"\" TV, setting this device up was a breeze. It is remarkably light, and even though you are supposed to set it up with someone else helping you out, a reasonably strong person could do it by himself. The connections and all the other setup features were also reasonably easy to figure out and configure, although this could be just my bias - over the years I've set up a fair number of TVs and other \"\"screen\"\"-based devices, so I am very familiar with all of its ins and outs. If, on the other hand, you don't know the difference between, say an HDMI and component cables, then you might want to have someone a bit more technically savvy helping you out.***** Picture Quality *****Despite all the advances over the years in various features of the \"\"smart\"\" TVs, for me the number one consideration when buying a new TV is the picture quality. Fortunately TV manufacturers have been more than obliging in this department in recent years, and each year we are treated to some new improvement. Today most TVs made by the top brand manufacturers more than meet my minimum requirements. Even so, the visual quality of the content that can be viewed on this LG TV is just stunning. The colors are crisp and vibrant, and the contrast is very impressive as well. The TV features very wide viewing angles, and it can be enjoyed throughout even a larger living room.This is the first TV that I've owned which features the 240 Hz refresh rate. Personally I am a bit ambivalent about it. Yes, it makes the picture seem much smoother, but this effect can be look petty unnatural when you see it for the first time. It almost has the feel of a homemade video. You get used to it after a while, though, and the \"\"normal\"\" TVs start looking choppy.***** 3D *****I am not a huge fan of 3D TV, but given a chance I don't mind watching that kind of visually enhanced content. When it comes to movies, I guess I am still very much \"\"old school.\"\" A few action-packed and/or visually enhanced movies that came out in recent years do make the 3D worth having around. The same goes for the few sports channels - watching high-level athletic competition in 3D is definitely a great experience. However, for the most part, I still don't see the 3D technology as a make-or-break for my TV experience.This TV comes with four pairs of 3D goggles. This is enough for your typical nuclear family these days, but you may want to get a few extra ones if you are planning on watching some 3D content with guests. This TV uses the passive 3D technology, which in my experience is much easier on the eyes and makes for cheaper and lighter goggles.***** Sound Quality *****Unlike the picture quality, the sound quality of the TVs in recent years has not been showing nearly comparable improvement. The sound of this TV is more than adequate for your casual watching, but if you really want to make the most of this TV - be it for amazing sports or movies - you will certainly need to invest into a better external sound system. This is fine as far as I am concerned - I already have a pretty good sound bar that I've been using from before. But if you are trying to determine your total budget for a new TV, then this consideration should be another thing to keep in mind.***** Build and Design *****This is a very elegant and svelte looking TV. It is very light, but it feels very sturdy and well built. The lack of thick bezel makes the TV look almost like a stand-alone work of art. It also makes it seem smaller than it really is, something that I am not too bothered with.***** Online Content *****These days I primarily rely on Netflix for my content, so I have come to expect from a TV to provide an easy Internet access. However, in the past, aside from a few very specific TV \"\"apps\"\" I've had the hard time accessing most of the online content. With this Google TV I've been able to access more content than I ever did before, aside from accessing it all on my computer. Furthermore, the Google search function makes finding things to watch incredibly easy and intuitive.***** Live Primetime Guide *****One of the biggest frustrations that I have with TV in general is the difficulty of finding the right programing. Most TV systems still rely on a cumbersome set of menus and scrolling which gets incredibly tedious when you have to deal with hundreds, if not thousands, channels. Some Cable systems (including TiVo for instance) have a more manageable search features, but even these are far from ideal. The inability to find the right kind of programming on demand is particularly frustrating when compared with the almost magical ability to find stuff online. A Google TV seems like an ideal solution to those woes.The LG keyboard remote is pretty good interface solution for accessing the guide. The keyboard is diminutive and you would not want to use it for any kind of extensive typing, but as an access point for text input it is more than adequate. The keyboard also has a voice-input functionality. So far I have only used it sporadically, and if my use of Siri is anything to go by, then I don't see myself using it a lot in the future. However, for all those who prefer this kind of input it is a very convenient feature to have.***** Conclusion *****This is a truly very beautiful, functional, and glossy TV with a lots of \"\"smart\"\" features. After using it for a few weeks I am more than happy with everything that it has to offer. However, if you are \"\"only\"\" concerned with getting the best picture quality for your money, and all those other higher-end features don't impress you all that much, then there are many other much cheaper TVs available right now.\"", "\"I bought this TV at Best Buy and ultimately ended up returning it.  I'm came from a 1080p Epson Projector that projected on to a 100\"\" screen.  I had decided that I wanted to try the newer LED tv's out since we were moving anyway and did not want to bring the projector with us to our new home.I primarily looked at two TV models when I was looking in to TV's, the Samsung UN60F8000 and the LG 55GA7900.  I actually bought and tested both of the TV's out.  Below is a short Pros/Cons review and conclusion on both TV's.LG 55GA7900-------------------------Pros- Price... much cheaper than the F8000- Google TV integration for Apps (apps to enable airplay/etc)- Decent picture quality- Awesome remoteCons- No ARC capability for HDMI audio passthrough- Plex app does not play 3D SBS files- Not all apps in google play store are available- Google TV interface for Tivo integration not the bestSamsung UN60F8000-------------------------Pros- Awesome picture quality- Innovative, if somewhat limited, remote (would like more dedicated buttons and a QWERTY keyboard- ARC capability!!! Can use single HDMI cable to pass 5.1DD and DTS audio back to receiver from apps like Plex, Amazon Instant Video, and Netflix- Built in Skype and camera- Built in Plex app supports 3D SBS files natively!!!Cons- Limited app selection (though the essential apps are there - Plex, Skype Amazon Instant Video, Netflix)- Price... would have liked it to be a few hundred cheaper- ARC setup is not intuitive and there is limited documentation on how to get it set upCONCLUSION-------------------------After testing both TV's I ended up keeping the Samsung UN60F8000.  Although I was impressed with many of the bells and whistles that the GA7900 provided, I ultimately did not find many of the features to be useful and I found many of the apps were a little buggy and the interface was not entirely intuitive.  I really only use my TV to do 2 things... watch TV and watch movies from Amazon/Netflix/Plex.  Everything else is really unnecessary for me as I find that browsing the internet and things like that are better suited for a tablet or laptop.  Overall, the F8000 seemed like a better TV for my purposes, plus I really like that I can use HDMI ARC to send 5.1 and DTS signals to my receiver when watching movies through netflix/amazon or Plex.  The final plus for me with the F8000 is that the Plex app is much better IMO than on the GA7900.  The plex app on the Samsung F8000 comes pre-installed and can play 3D movies natively whereas the GA7900 using the plex app could not play the same 3D movie.  I couldn't be happier with my TV choice... if you use plex and need HDMI ARC the F8000 seemed to be one of the few TV's that could actually send 5.1 and DTS signals over the ARC interface.\"", "\"The LG GA7900 is a great looking panel loaded with a GoogleTV operating system that isn't quite fully baked.  LG also makes theLG Electronics 42GA6400 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Google TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses(GA6400) series of televisions, which I recently reviewed on Amazon.  Some of the features are identical between those two GoogleTV series, so parts of my review will be recycled, but I will point out the differences in the GA7900 below so you can compare and contrast the two units while you're shopping.HARDWAREI'll start with the physical specifications of the television first.  Assembly of the stand is pretty typical for LCD sets, and I had no problem attaching the 8 screws required to get the TV in an upright position by myself.  I would have preferred a base with a standard X pattern, but the two \"\"arms coming out to hug you\"\" stand is stable enough and doesn't take up a huge footprint.  It's somewhat of a bummer, but the stand lacks a tilt/rotation capability.  There are 4 HDMI inputs on the side of the TV, a headphone output, an optical out, 3 USB inputs, and some 1/8\"\" jacks that allow you to plug in composite and component in cables via the supplied adapters.  There is an additional 1/8\"\" jack for the IR blaster adapter (also supplied--it's a Y-adapter with two IR blasters connected to the same jack).  There is also an ethernet jack and a coax cable input for direct standard cable signal or an over-the-air antenna.  All of these inputs are on the left side of the TV (oriented while you're facing the LCD screen). The 3-prong, grounded power cord is attached to the opposite side of the TV from the inputs.  Unfortunately, I feel like the power cord could be a little longer.  The frame is slightly slimmer and has an angular, and more aggressively styled bezel on the GA7900 compared to the very squared-off shape of the GA6400, but it looks cool.  The sound on the GA7900 has a little more bass and \"\"oomph\"\" than the GA6400, but they're still stock TV speakers and nothing to get excited about.PICTUREI received the 47 inch version of the GA7900 for review.  It's a full 1080p, LED edgelit screen.  While I can't find specifics on the technology used, the GA7900 boasts some degree of local microdimming.  The result is a dramatic difference between the GA7900 and GA6400 in terms of black levels and contrast.  The GA7900 does an excellent job of producing something close to a \"\"true\"\" black on an LCD with a substantial contrast range.  Basically, most of the cost and performance difference between the GA7900 and GA6400 is located here, as the picture is significantly improved in the 7900.  I was also impressed with the clean black around the edges of the panel.  I didn't detect any noticeable light bleeding out near the bezel.  You'll have to move up to the very high-end (and more expensive) microdimming Samsung F8000s, Sony XBRs and Sharp ELITEs to reach better black levels on an LCD.  And of course, good plasma TV tech still produces the best blacks. Color reproduction on the GA7900 is very good compared to similarly priced sets.  Reds and greens have an appropriate amount of saturation and color accuracy.  I didn't find anything looking too warm or too cool.  The 240Hz refresh rate holds up well versus similarly priced sets and does a commendable job handling live sporting events.  I only noticed minimal digital motion blur during very fast NHL hockey action.  Overall, the GA7900's panel pretty much performs as well as anything in its price range.3DThis LG comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses (similar to the glasses you get in a movie theatre).  Since my 3D options are somewhat limited, I ordered a free OnDemand viewing of Ice Age 4 in 3D.  I enjoyed the 3D effect and I never experienced any cross-signal.  The 3D viewing angle isn't that wide, but you can maintain a quality depth effect if you're sitting  within 45 degrees away from straight-on.  I was surprised that I wound up preferring this passive 3D effect over my active-shutter 3D glasses I use with my Samsung ES7500.  It's also nice that you don't have to worry about putting batteries in the glasses.  The 3D here works more or less as well as the GA6400.REMOTEIf you're reading this review the reason you're considering this TV is because it's a Google TV.  Well, really, the GoogleTV software goes hand-in-hand with this iteration of the LG magic remote (the remote is the same for the GA6400and GA7900).  LG made an incredible remote for this TV, however, they also annoyed me to no end by not going the extra mile and including a couple simple, intuitive features.  First, the good...the keyboard works great and is so much better than trying to type out search phrases in a SmartTV with a D-pad.  The pointer works very well.  It's basically a poor-man's version of a Wiimote.  Some of the features, like holding down the gesture button and air-drawing semi-circles to zoom in can be next to useless, but for the majority of the GoogleTV interface this remote is a wonderful match.  Unfortunately, the remote has problems whenever I try to use my Comcast DVR.  There are times when I want to use my DVR's channel guide (see below) and unfortunately, this remote does NOT have page up and page down buttons.  This problem could be alleviated if LG can fix the firmware and allow a single click of the scroll wheel down to send a \"\"page down\"\" signal to the DVR through the IR blaster.  The other main issue is that, amazingly, there is no STOP button.  There is a separate play and a separate pause button, but no stop.  Why not make one button PLAY/PAUSE and the other button STOP?  When I'm watching DVR video I need the stop button to get me out of the program I'm watching and give me the option to delete it.  Instead, all I can do is pause, and then hit BACK, which takes me all the way out of the DVR menu structure.  It's annoying.  Buried within the menus is the ability to assign functions to the red, yellow, green, and blue buttons, but I tried to assign the page up and down functions and it didn't work.  There is a lot of empty space on the front of the remote.  Why didn't LG add a couple more buttons for page up/down and stop...and even 0-9 while they're at it?  The other minor things I miss are having a backlit display and a \"\"flashback\"\" button to flick back and forth between two channels.  Finally, some keys have secondary functions, but they are written in a tiny red font that is nearly impossible for me to see and probably invisible to people with red-green color blindness.GOOGLE TVObviously, this is the differentiator for LG's GA series of televisions.  If you ask me is it worth paying a little extra cash for a GA model over a competitive panel with the same picture quality to have GoogleTV built-in, my answer as of June 2013 would be---not yet.  Hopefully some software and firmware updates will soon change that answer to a definitive YES.  GoogleTV essentially tries to overlay its interface on top of your DVR's interface and cable (or satellite) signal.  When you start up your GoogleTV, you are required to log in with a Google account.  Not a fan of Google's privacy policies?  Too bad, you'll have to deal with it.  The main purpose of your account is to provide access to the Google store for app downloads to your TV.  Once you're logged in, you calibrate the unit to the type of TV signal you receive, what area you're in, and whether or not your receive premium channels.  From there it takes a few minutes to load, but GoogleTV takes over and provides you with its channel guide.  The GoogleTV channel guide is similar to Apple's cover flow for music.  Instead of seeing a common spreadsheet grid from your DVR, you instead thumb through mini-images of movie and TV show posters.  At first glance, it seems like a much more intuitive way to find content.  However, it only works well for live TV and shows that are going to start within 5 minutes.  You won't see shows that are going to begin in an hour.  On a normal DVR channel grid, I can flick around and randomly notice a program that will come on in one hour.  At that point in time, I can either choose to record it or plan to watch it.  With GoogleTV, you are instead supposed to know what you want to watch and use the keyboard or voice search to find it.  The search will find it on upcoming TV listings, Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, etc (there is no Hulu Plus on this set as of June 2013).  The difference is that you have to know what you are looking for ahead of time.  While using GoogleTV, a double press of the Guide button will send you to the DVR channel grid, but without the aforementioned page up/down buttons navigating is an imprecise chore.  The TV has a 2-hour sleep feature to keep its content up-to-date.  If you shut off the TV and come back an hour later you won't miss a beat.  If you shut off the TV and return the next day, it can take 30 seconds to 5 minutes for the Guide to update and be ready to use.The GooglePlay app store is...weird.  Within the app store I can click GAMES and I'm taken to a page that shows subheadings for featured items, editor's picks, etc.  Except that there are zero, and I literally mean zero apps on these pages.  It's as if the store is empty.  However, if I search within the store for \"\"solitaire,\"\" I'm given the option to download a game that works on the TV.  Once again, you need to know exactly what you're looking for.  There are a very limited number of apps, though.  I believe the problem is that GoogleTV is running a variant of Android 3.2 instead of the 4.X running on most phones and tablets for 2012-2013.  I have no idea if an upgrade to 4.X will provide more apps.  Of the apps that are there, it's a somewhat mixed bag.  The internet browser is amazingly not horrible for a TV, thanks in large part to the keypad remote with scroll wheel and Wii-like pointer.  I had a difficult time with streaming services, though.  Short YouTube clips have worked well, but AmazonPrime hasn't been perfect.  At first, I searched for \"\"Avengers,\"\" and Google directed me to an option to watch a comprehensive list of movies that I could pay for or watch for free.  That search part is wonderful.  I selected the movie, Thor, because it was free through my Amazon Prime subscription.  I was able to get through the whole movie, but there were 2 instances where I had to wait for buffer loading in HD.  While not perfect, recent updates in the AmazonVideo app have dramatically improved streaming performance and it gives me hope that a few more software/firmware updates will really improve GoogleTV.SUMMARYIn conclusion, the GA7900 is a very good television.  The panel's picture quality and its ability to compete against similarly priced sets on the market today is why I'm giving this product a 5-star review.  You could still simply use this set like any other TV and choose to ignore the GoogleTV features and be pleased with the picture (you'll still need to create that Google account, though).  My only caveat is that the GoogleTV functionality as of June 2013 still has a ways to go before it can fully and precisely interact with a DVR's menus, or altogether replace them.  The software has some cool advantages with its image-based content scrolling, but it's still too limited in its current form.  Hopefully Google can update the software to Android 4.X (rumored to happen later in 2013), and offer ways to stumble onto TV programs without me needing to know exactly what I want to watch.  The remote is one step away from being one of the best gadgets of the year, but the lack of just a couple buttons is a mind-blowing admission.  It would be great if LG can provide some new firmware to perhaps assign more functions to the colored remote buttons.  The mystical TV-watching experience I was hoping for is so tantalizing close, but yet remains beyond the reach of my magic remote clenched hand.(If Google/LG push out significant upgrades I'll try to update this review).\"", "\"For the image quality, I give it a 5.  You can have it dim in a dim room, which I find easier on the eyes.  It shows a crystal clear picture, and glorious 3D.  It's easily movie theater quality.For gaming, it supports dual screen with separate glassesLG Electronics AG-F310DP Cinema 3D Dual Play Gaming Glasses (2 Pair).  With this both players see their game full screen, in full HD.  I highly recommend this accessory for the gamer.The sound system is worth 5 stars if you set it up exactly right.  You can set the sound for wall mount or stand.  You can normalize the audio levels for extra clarity on the dialog.  There is an option to automatically sync the video to the audio.  The last two are turned off by default and you'll have a superior experience if you turn them on.  There are a lot of options, and it's worth the trouble to spend a little while playing with them until you get the configuration that works best for the acoustics of your room.  The TV is capable of excellent sound out of the box, but truly amazing audio once you have it turned just right.The TV is exceptionally clever at points.  ESPN 3D broadcasts on a top bottom split, so if the TV isn't in the correct mode, you see two images one above the other.  HBO on Demand 3D does it left and right.  With other TVs I've seen, you need to use the remote to tell the TV that it is supposed to be 3D and which mode it is being broadcast in.  This one initially shows the split screen, but figures it out and makes the switch itself in less than a minute.The remote is the weakest element.  You can use the pointer (think wii mote), and it has a nifty \"\"shake to center\"\" feature.  You can use the up and down arrows to point to your selection.  You can give it voice commands.  \"\"Show Netflix\"\" and \"\"CBS\"\".  You don't need to be precise so \"\"Hulu\"\" works the same as \"\"Show Hulu\"\". When you use the voice command and say \"\"watch TV\"\" the screen shows the phrase \"\"live TV\"\".  You do not want to say the phrase \"\"live TV\"\".  Just trust me on that one.  You can use the voice command to pull up the HDMI selection screen, but then you need to point and click to the one you want.  If it can't figure it out, say if you ask for \"\"SyFy\"\" for which there are multiple stations, it will show a list of best guesses.  If you ask for HBO, it will always bring you to HBO Go.On the plus side, the keyboard is convenient for searching, and the buttons are similar to those on a phone.  Integrating with other systems is done via IR blaster.  You sit an IR device over the IR receiver on the device you want to control and the TV pretends to be that device's remote.  It is good at pulling up the guide for your local programming provider, and changing channels, even without IR blaster.Overall, this TV falls somewhere between \"\"Wow\"\" and \"\"Belongs on the Starship Enterprise\"\".\"", "\"This is the second LG TV we've gotten through Amazon.  Both TVs arrived in excellent condition and presented no delivery problems.  Setting up the LG 47GA7900 was easy, although we didn't follow manufacturer instructions that said to lay the TV on its face while installing the stand.  Not wanting to put any pressure on the LED-LCD screen, one person held it vertically on one side while the other person screwed the stand into the back of the TV.  The 47\"\" TV only weighs 32 lbs and is easy enough for two people to handle safely.  The stand is attractive and provides solid TV support.We connected a Charter cable box (manufactured by Motorola), a Sony Blu-Ray player using HDMI cables and a Samsung sound bar using an optical cable. This package includes an \"\"IR blaster\"\" cable with two IR transmitters that need to be positioned in front of the components' IR receivers.  The IR blaster allows you to use the LG remote to access some of the functions of the components.  We placed one IR blaster transmitter in front of our cable box and the other in front of our Blu-ray player.  We were never able to control the Samsung sound bar using the LG remote.  The sound bar works fine, we just need to use the Samsung remote to control the volume and sound bar features.  The TV easily found and connected to our home wireless network router.The gesture wii-style function seems to move the cursor arrow in unpredictable directions, so we try to use the arrow cursor keys for screen navigation whenever possible.  Finding and adjusting settings takes some searching.  After changing the screen brightness and setting the screen size ratio to automatically sense and adjust according to the given input signal format, we now have a beautiful picture.  The qwerty keyboard on one side of the remote is great for entering words or URL's in the Google Chrome browser.  Unfortunately, LG chose to write some of the functions in red font on small black keys that are next to impossible to read (lights/magnifying glass help).  The voice search is interesting and useful, but not always accurate.  For example, it kept finding \"\"Prime\"\" this and that when we clearly and repeatedly enunciated John Prine.  That doesn't happen too often, though.  Its quick ability to search TV and web for basically anything we want more than makes up for a few idiosyncrasies.  The remote works well for controlling the TV, but the IR blaster is a poor substitute for either the components' manufacturers' remote controls or a well designed multi-component remote control like Logitech makes.The picture quality of this TV is absolutely beautiful in 2D or 3D.  The built in speakers are adequate but an additional sound system is recommended for better theater quality sound.  The home screen is easy to navigate, but watching how-to videos on LG's website for a more complete picture also might help.The Google TV platform has many applications for gaming and access to movies and TV programs that mostly require subscriptions to view.  Our Google Chrome TV experience is much different than using the computer web browser on our PC.  We are still exploring the many ways to access content and figure out what our family likes best.For those who aren't ready for or don't want Google TV features, we highly recommendLG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses.  This TV has the same beautiful picture quality, is cheaper and offers many similar features.  Because it lacks voice and keypad controls, the search process is a bit slower, but nonetheless it's a wonderful TV.  Don't be afraid to buy via Amazon--we were initially hesitant to get costly electronics through Amazon, but each transaction has gone perfectly from start to finish.\"", "Out of the box, the first thing that I noticed about this TV was the bezel, or rather the near lack of one. Its an attractive feature although it makes installation a bit tricky.  The next thing I noticed was the picture quality. Its excellent. Local dimming provides for nice blacks and for the most part doesn't introduce artifacts (on some static menus there was a bit of a background gradient visisble).  3D also looks great once you try something besides the included videos.While the 240hz smoothing provides a liquid feel, I preferred to turn it off.  Here the UI reared its ugly head, to get to the fine tuning adjustments requires popping into the GoogleTV home page and digging through menus. This is doubly problematic for trying to choose between the various smoothing options as it isn't possible to switch the settings while video is playing.GoogleTV isn't all bad though. The remote is pretty neat, though a little laggy and being able to do voice searches is very cool.  There is a limited selection of apps but many of the big ones are there. Not all the apps are that polished compared to what you find on a device like the Roku or a console.  The main GoogleTV concept of intercepting an HDMI feed from a cable box and providing a guide overlay is also pretty neat, if you are using STB or similar as a TV source. Sadly, support for TV over DLNA from a CableCARD source (HDHomeRunPrime) isn't there.  Nor is it possible to use WMC7 as a tv source and provide control over IP, although this is such a niche application that it isn't surprising.  In general DLNA support was pretty bad, although the built in Plex app worked well.Another quibble is with control of the tv over ethernet.  It's very simple to connect an Android device to the TV and use it as a remote.  However, it isn't possible to turn the TV on using a remote app, only off. There don't appear to be TV codes that will work with a universal remote to control the TV so the only way to turn the TV on is manually or with the supplied remote.Overall, the TV combines great image quality with a UI that includes many tradeoffs.  Aside from the Google-centric features, the GoogleTV interface isn't up to the level of the competition and adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the menu structure.", "My goal for years has been to have a fully integrated device where one can watch TV, view content from my NAS and surf the web.  I have dreamed of being able to be watching a movie, and while still watching be able to look up the stats on an actor.  I have bought many of  the devices to attach to the TV like the popcorn hour and many others but until now I finally settled on a home grown HTPC.That was then - - -but - - - now my goal is fulfilled.This TV does it all,  I won't go into all of the features because they are spelled out very well in the other reviews but let me tell you that with this TV, I  can seamlessly surf while I watch TV with the picture in picture feature.  Also through the app section, I can use the Plex app to access my Synology NAS to select and play my movies, music and more.But that is not  all.  In my opinion, the picture is as clear and  sharp as any i have seen on display at Best Buy.  The 3D is easy to use and  the quality is 90% or so as good as what you see in the theater.  The voice feature of the remote is nothing less than remarkable.  It almost always understands  what I say. The QWERTY keyboard is a real help too if you want to browse.  All the buttons that you need to get around your TV are on that side of the remote.But this TV is not for everyone.  If you want to walk a well worn path of technology where all the bugs are worked out and the TV is totally compatible with all other devices,  look elsewhere.In playing with the TV I have found a variety of things that are either bugs or at least annoying.1, If you hook your TV to a sound  system, you cannot use the mute button on the remote (I confirmed that with LG)2.  Sometimes the remote freezes up and you have to press the down arrow key to unfreeze it (I found that by trial and error)3. Documentation is the pits!  You just have to use trial and error4.  The menu system on the TV is very confusing!  It varies based on where you are in the program and for me it was difficult to re-find options that i had found previously.5,  The remote is too small!  My hands were cramping after a bit of us.  I don't see any reason that it couldn't have been a couple of  inches longer.6. All of the keyboard functions  are not explained. I have cox cable and when  doing certain functions like confirming an erase on my DVD I have to press a button on my cox remote in the shape of a yellow triangle.  Only aft holding the function button down and pressing every button did I find the magic combination (hint it is the one with the yellow underscore plus the function button)7.  The function keys are in dark red!  I had to use a pair of glasses a magnifying glass and a flashlight to be able to read them8.  I could go  on.  There are lots of little things like that.To sum up my experience, I think that this TV provides a tremendous value for the money and I  am very happy with my purchase  even if i can't use my mute button.  Just be sure that if you want the functionality that this TV provides, either be prepared to put up with some annoyances or wait for a later model.  For me though I couldn't wait and I  am glad that i didn't.So for now, I am going to press the voice button on my remote and say, Google TV find me a Star Trek movie...then look up the age of Leonard Nimoy.  This is so cool!UPDATE 10/5/2013 - As I have become used to this TV I only love it more and more.  My only real complaint is the lack of a mute button.  Everything other issue has been resolved with use.UPDATE 11/14/13 - There has been a major software update and now - - - THE MUTE BUTTON WORKS!!  So cool.  A lot of other awkward menu logic has also been fixed as well.  This TV just keeps getting better and better!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.18287865817546844, 0.4368319809436798, 0.20011663436889648, 0.0017132136272266507, 0.0005099772824905813, 0.14948830008506775, 0.0033532714005559683, 0.02282852493226528, 0.002279414562508464]]}
