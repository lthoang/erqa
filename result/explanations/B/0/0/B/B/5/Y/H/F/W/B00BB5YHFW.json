"], "reviews": ["I had to update my previous five star review. This isn't very old and just stopped working.Previous review:My step daughter does hair for a living. She tried this out on my son and gave him a pretty nice faux hawk. She said that it isn't quite as powerful as her professional clippers and doesn't have quite the flexibility, but for a home set of clippers, she gave it a thumbs up. She loves that she doesnt have to change clips. She also claimed that it is top of the line for a man's home use.We also like the sleek design, the digital adjustment, and the fact that it is space saving plus you don't lose clips. Her professional clippers are in the $200 range and have to go through a great deal more wear and tear than these.", "I have cut my own hair for well over 10 years now. I keep my hair cut very short and I just don't see any reason to go to the barber shop. I seem to replace my clippers about once every year. I have tried many different electric clippers over the years with most of them either being really bad or really good. I think these clippers would definitely fall into the very really good category. I don't know that they are my absolute favorite of all time but they are one of the best.These clippers are very unique because it has a touch screen on the top of it. At the touch of a button you can change the length of cut right down to the nearest millimeter. That means no more confusion about which attachment to use, all you have to do if remember the number of millimeters for your favorite length. There are three different comb attachments depending on what length you cut your hair. However most people would probably only use the same comb attachment and wouldn't need the others. The combination of the three different comb attachments and adjustable clippers will give you over 100 different length combinations. It also comes with a travel bag but everything doesn't fit in the bag so what's the point. Why not make the bag a little bigger?These clippers will charge within 90 minutes and will run for about 40 minutes on a full charge. The battery life is good enough to complete several haircuts before charging. On the downside you must charge these clippers with the included USB cord. It doesn't have the ability to charge with an electric power outlet. I am not sure what they were thinking by doing this and it just makes it more difficult to charge. I think that these clippers are a little quieter than the average pair of clippers.These clippers are strong enough to cut through a thick head of hair without bogging down, jamming or cutting badly. They give a nice clean cut without having to go over and over the same area. While you are in the cutting mode the length adjustment locks in place so that you don't accidently hit the button while you are cutting. Hair tends to get stuck in the comb attachment but that happens with most clippers. It usually just takes a few shakes and most of the hair will fall out. Occasionally you will have to remove the comb attachment and clear the hair but that doesn't happen often. They also cut well without the comb attachment. They give a nice clean cut when trimming around your neck, ears and sides.Overall I think these clippers are a good choice. There may be better clippers if money is no option but I think these work well and are a good value for the price.", "This Remington haircut clipper gives you total control over your haircuts. You can find your exact length you want without guess work and use the lock and cut switch lock on the setting of your choosing then it activates the clipper. The storage concern is no longer a worry about pieces getting lost or flying all over the place if you drop them because the adjustable combs give you the versatility of 100 or more combs without so many pieces laying around creating a messy space issue. Its also interesting that these blades are self sharpening.. you do not have to wonder if your hair is going to get tugged by a dull blade. The power system is a serious bonus too giving you a choice between using it with the cord or to charge it up and go cord free for 40 minutes at a time. The blade has a quick release system thats great for easy cleaning and the touch features show the tri boost, the remaining battery life, and length adjustment clearly. This is great for your personal use or to give as a gift!", "THIS is an outstanding hair-cutting tool.Where do I start?Okay, with the fact that it is cordless!  This is FANTASTIC - not tripping over the stupid wire, not worrying about cutting the wire - Yes I am that special ;-)  And the charge holds for about 40 minutes after an overnight plug. I trimmed all of my hair - really thick frizzy - and after about four minutes of having it on and off - the charge was still up at 39 minutes.  It powered through - not even faltering.  Very solid product.  The strength of the motor was consistent - no worries there.Okay - you are going to have to keep the directions if you are like me and the icons are not self explanatory.  Also you will need to learn the left side of the shaft has the A B C height level and the right side has the on/off and lock.The middle top of the wand has all the electronic touch features and everything is electronic - the cutters rise and lower with the up and down arrows - no obnoxious CLUNKING into place - they just easily automatically slide up or down; there are three speeds - controllable all on the wand - I think the icon is a speedometer - and the battery level charge is there as well.  I LOVE checking the batter level!I just loved this trimmer.  I plugged it in overnight and it was good to go.  Reading the directions and going through all the buttons took a solid five minutes.  Since I won't use this every day, I will keep the directions in the pouch.Let me tell you that the additional snap on attachments all fit perfectly and are easy to get on and off - NOT like my other cutter that I really struggle with snapping the combs on and off.One thing to note - always use two drops of oil on the blades before you start.  I didn't know that, so I am glad it was very clear in the directions for using this cutter.I am not sure if you could use this is in an industrial setting all day, but for the home user - I give it an A+++", "If you are looking for a nice weight haircutter this works fine. I like to trim a little around the edges when I don't get in for a cut. I'm sure it would work fine for a whole haircut if you knew what you were doing.", "I thought these clippers would be much more advanced than your standard manual control ones. In the positive side, it is lightweight, recharges and it is easy to change the settings. On the bad side, if you have thick hair, even if you start out at the highest setting and work your way down to the lower settings, hair gets clumped in the blades and in the guide. This means while cutting the hair, you have to stop frequently to clean the hair out or else the clippers are useless.", "My grandfather was a barber and my pop always had great tools.  This reminds me of those tools but not the price. They have three speeds and are variable.  They are not big and clumsy, they fit in a lady's hand quite nicely, and do the job. Not bad for the price.I like the fact they are cordless.  Be sure to charge it up as soon as you get it.  If you feel uncomfortable about cutting hair, this is a nice tool for between visits to the barber.  I used it on my nephew, around the back of the neck and the sideburn areas and it worked well and spruced up his look.", "\"I'm not a professional hair stylist but neither am I a novice. I've cut my husband's hair for the last ten years and my son's for the last four. Therefore, I was amazed at how difficult these clippers were to use.The worst: I put in the appropriate comb, adjusted it to the desired length and turned it on. But as I pressed the clippers to my husband's head, the comb SLIPPED and went down to the closest setting. I almost completely shaved a swath out of my husband's head. I gasped, which immediately worried my husband (You never want to hear a gasp from the person cutting your hair.) My husband looked in the mirror and thankfully, he kept a calm disposition and said, \"\"Well, I guess you'll have to make the whole head that length now...\"\" In the end, with creative blending, the haircut turned out well and my husband was pleased but adjustable combs should not slip like that. From now on, I always test it by pressing down with my fingers before putting it up to my husband's head.And really, the adjustable combs are a nuisance. The only time they are locked in place is when you are actively cutting. But the moment you turn the motor off, the combs are adjustable again. The controls are very sensitive and an accidental brush from my fingers would change the settings. When I put it on the counter, if I accidentally put it face down, the lengths would get screwy. It got exasperating very quickly.The combs themselves are also poorly designed. They wrap all the way around the clippers so that the excess hair gets stuck within the combs and jam things up. I had to stop periodically to remove great gobs of hair.Lastly, you would think turning something off would be a easy thing but not with this! You press the power button and wait. The display remains on for a bit longer and if accidentally touch one of the controls, it immediately comes back on! So you really have to sit there and wait for the darned thing to completely shut off before you put it back in its case.And of course, the case is too small. You have to be a master at Tetris to get the clippers and all the accessories in the case and be able to zip it up.Clearly, this product did not go through a rigorous testing process before being offered to the public.\"", "Pros-nice looking (cool digital display)easy to use (once you get the hang of it)cordlessergonomiccuts hair efficiently ( I didn't cut anybodys ears off, hurray!)cons-digital display took some time to figure out (ok so I didnt read the directions!)heavier than a corded model (may cause fatigue with use with multiple rugrats)rechargeable battery life questionableoverall seems like a good value for the occasional user", "\"When I first orderd this trimmer, I had visions of trimming my dog (Lhasa Apso) with it.  However, my fiance saw the package when it came in the mail and declared it a dog free zone.  If it touched the dog, it would not touch his beard.  This is a man frequently mistaken for Santa a few weeks after a beard trim so I was more than happy to let him \"\"claim\"\" it as long as he talked to me as he used it.  Then it sat on the bathroom counter, plugged in and charged, for the next several weeks.  I read the instructions and played with the settings.  It's very nice because it gives you the option of selecting barber values (use a number 3) or length (1/4 inch).  I set it for barber values.  A simple touch on the up and down arrows adjusts the guard.  It comes with two different guards and a switch on the side to let the trimmer know which guard is installed.  When you are ready to trim, lock the guard in place and have fun.So far this review probably hasn't told you what you REALLY want to know.  How well does it shave.  My fiance finally used it for the first time last night and I can promise you it will never get near the dog.  He has had a thick, coarse beard for more than 20 years and has gone through MANY trimmers.  He declared this trimmer to be the best he has ever used.  The cut was smooth and clean with no pulling or tugging on the beard.  His beard was pretty long so he set it on #1 and trimmed it very short.  The cut was even and looked like he had just been to the barber.  He said it had lots of power and was suprised because it's a cordless shaver.My final assessment:  quick charging; easy to program; sharp and powerful.  I recommend it and might have to invest in another one so I can use it on my dog.\"", "I've had this haircut kit a month now and have tried it out twice and overall i am very happy and have had no issues at all with it. If your looking for a quality, easy to use cordless haircut kit this is definitely one i can recommend. Here are my observations during my time with it:(1) 3 combs (1.5mm , 3-23mm, and 22-42mm). The combs themselves are well made and durable even though they are made from clear plastic. I wouldnt have any fears of them breaking. They were easy to attach and remove as well.(2) touch buttons were both positioned well and tuned perfectly. Not too responsive or unresponsive to touches; with increments of .5mm per touch. Dont worry about accidentally pressing the touch buttons, the only way the trimmer starts running is when you turn the switch on the side, which locks the touch buttons.(3) very high quality feeling device and despite its size , handles nicely and isnt too burdensome.(4) one minor thing was since there is a display showing the mm's being used and 3 different combs, you have to adjust a switch on the left each time you change a comb so that it shows the proper mm being used on the display.Other tidbits:Comes with case, small brush and oil tube.it can charge via usb (though it takes quite long), or via ac adaptor (~90minutes).It has a barbershop numbering system as well, instead of the default mm if you prefer it.Display turns off automatically 10 seconds after motor is turned off.", "\"We have several different razors (corded and cordless) that I use to shave my husbands head and this is my favorite. Sometimes I find cordless razors just aren't as powerful as the corded ones I have but this isn't the case with this razor. It's quite powerful and it has 3 different speeds. I had no problems shaving his head which he lets grow out for a few weeks. He likes it short (usually a #1 or no guard on some razors). The guards easily slide on/off this so it makes cleaning it quite easy.This razor has some really unique features that I haven't seen on any other razor. One is the adjustable levels by just hitting the up/down arrows. The razor itself only comes with 3 combs/guards because that is all you need with this as you can adjust the levels to almost any level you can imagine so you can really customize the cut. You can use the typical #1, #2, #3 that you would ask the barber for or you dial in to the MM. It would really make getting a nice fade easy since you can easily select which level you want without having to change the combs (and have to worry about storing 15 combs). The other feature that was really different is the touch interface. There aren't any buttons or switches on the front but its all a touch interface. It was very easy to use and responsive. It also will \"\"lock\"\" the display when you are cutting so you don't accidentally move the comb up/down while cutting. It is also charges using USB so I can use any charger since I have an abundance of those around the house. it charges quite fast (about 1.5 hours) and it runs for quite a while without having to recharge and it still has full power after using it a few times.The razor is also nice and light and easy to grip. I would recommend this for anyone who wants trimmed or short hair as there are so many features.\"", "This is one fancy hair cutting tool. The instructions were a bit confusing, but once I got it figured out the thing is pretty cool. It has an LED display that shows the three speed levels, the amount of time left on the charge (You have about 40 minutes) and the length setting for each of three combs. As you press the buttons for up and down the comb rises or decends, so the length of your cut can be longer or shorter. I love the sleek look of it and the high tech features. The only problem is that it's very easy to press the up or down button by accident which could have some pretty disastrous results if you are cutting someone's hair.A plain old fashioned hair cutter is probably easier to use and certainly easier to figure out initially, but if you like the newest highly engineered products, you'll probably enjoy using this hair clipper.", "As soon as this arrived yesterday, I had to try it out. I was long overdue for a haircut and had, years ago, cut my own hair (modified buzz cut) with my trusty Wahl clippers. This was like a dream, a vast improvement over the Wahl, with its  different combs and pesky cord getting in the way. The sharpness of the blade, the power of the motor and the freedom from having to switch combs and shove a cord out of the way all made the process of cutting my own hair an almost pleasurable experience. I would say pleasurable if it actually cleaned up the hair on the bathroom floor but it fell down on that score--perhaps in the next iteration? All in all, this does the job well, making it possible for a novice like me to self-cut without ending up with a haircut I am embarrassed to show in public. Now, will I never return to my barber? No. This can't compare with the extra details I get from my barber (especially on the back of my head), but it does quite nicely in a pinch and I recommend it.", "I am real particular about hair cutting products so I was excited and apprehensive about receiving and trying this product.  Was pleasantly suprised upon getting it.Has a nice handle-some of the other ones I have are either too heavy or slip out of my hand.  Loved the different clips-it comes with several-the two I used worked very nice. Also comes with a black case to hold all items-which was nice my drawer is full of old ones that I cleaned up after getting this product. Also comes with a brush for cleaning.Good product I will be using for a long time.", "\"At first I became a bit annoyed with all the switches and buttons and adjustments on this razor, it seemed like they went overboard, but after using a bit, I got used to it. The various controls are not bad if you can set it up like you want then keep your hands off everything except the on/off button.The blades are very sharp and give a nice clean cut. I like using the smaller comb the best. With the larger combs, you have to be careful to maintain the same cutting angle or you'll get different lengths. A pro won't have a problem, but hair trimming doesn't come natural to me.This trimmer will do any length from super-close to about 2\"\". There are 3 combs, pick an approximate length by the comb then fine tune it on the trimmer. For longer lengths, you'll get a better result if you keep the cutting angle the same.When finished, brush of the blade with the included brush and pack it all into it's case. The case isn't fancy but it holds the trimmer, combs and accessories. Also included: wall charger, computer charger (uses standard micro usb) and oil.Time to recharge is 90 minutes or less.\"", "\"I WANTED to love these, as I've been cutting my husbands hair for over a year.  He is super picky, and previously spent $20-$30 every 4-6 weeks getting his hair cut.I learned how to clip horses when I was 10.  I owned a yorkie for almost 13 that I regularly groomed myself (because his skin was super sensitive and I was annoyed he'd come home with rashes), heck, I have even shaved down our long haired cat.  Cut my husbands hair? Pshh I got this.I digress. Anyway - I wanted to love these because they cut down on clutter, don't need to be plugged in to work (actually its recommended they aren't) and they seem like such a cool idea.My husband saw the USB cord and became nervous. How fancy are these clippers!  Well, for the record, as far as I'm concerned the USB is just for looks or I guess it could be useful if you travel a lot but I'm not exactly sure why the cord wouldn't be just as useful.There are three \"\"blade guards\"\", each with a length purpose with a pretty wide range (stubble, longer styles, shorter styles).When I first used these, they were great. Then I went to adjust them...and they did their own thing.  From there on out, It was a constant fight. I'd select \"\"4\"\" and they'd move to \"\"5.5\"\", I'd select \"\"6\"\" and they'd move to \"\"7\"\"....I was constantly trying to argue with them the length I wanted.Also, hair kept getting trapped in the guard which was annoying. I kept having to stop to clean it, and then argue with the clippers about the length - vicious cycle.If it wasn't for this, I would love these. I saw another reviewer was having the same issue, so its good to know I'm not alone.Until these bugs are worked out, I can't recommend.  I spent more time arguing with the clippers then I would have if I had used my old set that had I switch out the clips.\"", "I've been cutting my own hair for over ten years. At $40 to $50 including tip, three or four times a year my professional model hair clipper has more than paid for itself. And compared to a lot of haircuts I don't do that bad of a job (if I do say so...). The one problem I had was the cord and ten different attachments. The Remington takes care of those two problems.The Remington is light, cordless and only requires three attachments. The clipper adjusts so that each attachment has a wide range of lengths. I'm used to what is called the Barbershop length system which equates to something like this: a number 2 = one quarter inch, 4 = half, 8 = one inch, 12 = inch and a half. The Remington can be used that way or in meters and ranges from 0 to 13 in Barbershop mode.The way I've always done it is I start with the longest on top, then a 4 on the edges, then 8 to start blending. Then I use all the lengths in-between until it's decent enough for me. Occasionally, after a few showers I may have to do a little trimming.The Remington works quite well. Of course, first step was to charge it overnight. The included instructions are horrible, not even correct English. It took me a minute to realize that full charge was in minutes.  The pouch that comes with it is useless; not everything fits, it's awkward and cheap.While I love the fact that all you need to do is push a button to raise and lower the head the buttons are easy to touch and accidently adjust. You will want to double check (measure twice) before you switch to cutting mode. Which is also weird, it's a sliding lever on the side called lock mode: confusing. The digital readout is nice and easy to see. It turns off on its own after 10 seconds - not sure why the delay.The unit is light but also not as well built as my professional model. If you pop off the head you can how it is made and may wonder how long this will last. Overall it looks ok, like a man's clippers.But it's not nearly as expensive as my professional model, it's lighter, has less attachments to fiddle with and is cordless making it a lot easier to use. I'll eventually get used to the buttons and using it (probably after a mistake or two) and if it lasts it will make it a lot easier for me to get the job done!"], "Gamma": [0.16945001482963562, 0.3232453763484955, 0.11457699537277222, 0.3927275836467743], "Beta": [[0.05742926150560379, 0.057764504104852676, 0.05396492779254913, 0.05824004486203194, 0.05909711495041847, 0.059772126376628876, 0.05632028356194496, 0.04882717877626419, 0.05697902292013168, 0.05443265289068222, 0.05356601998209953, 0.0628446713089943, 0.05657603591680527, 0.041793618351221085, 0.060128673911094666, 0.05619076266884804, 0.04613640159368515, 0.05993671715259552], [0.05895796790719032, 0.05918511003255844, 0.0547599121928215, 0.05625466629862785, 0.06126130744814873, 0.06111140921711922, 0.057249728590250015, 0.04359972104430199, 0.05826161429286003, 0.05433923378586769, 0.05227721109986305, 0.06459823250770569, 0.0574495866894722, 0.034932851791381836, 0.06244650483131409, 0.057063233107328415, 0.04441453143954277, 0.06183713674545288], [0.05867379903793335, 0.05754079297184944, 0.04565870389342308, 0.059331014752388, 0.05837620049715042, 0.0594371035695076, 0.05599614232778549, 0.05110851675271988, 0.056494224816560745, 0.0546296052634716, 0.05419093370437622, 0.060780733823776245, 0.05647214129567146, 0.04584307223558426, 0.05935465916991234, 0.056862324476242065, 0.049947988241910934, 0.05930206552147865], [0.05918514356017113, 0.05997168645262718, 0.05147262290120125, 0.055763762444257736, 0.06255698204040527, 0.06227153539657593, 0.05783651024103165, 0.041673339903354645, 0.058984335511922836, 0.054302919656038284, 0.05227658152580261, 0.06529436260461807, 0.05806887522339821, 0.03215326741337776, 0.06387932598590851, 0.05756424367427826, 0.043477293103933334, 0.06326725333929062]]}
