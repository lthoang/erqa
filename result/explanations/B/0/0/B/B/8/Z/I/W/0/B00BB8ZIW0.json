UNTIL it sucked my hair in the back vent.  I currently use a Conair ionic Hair Dryer, which is very heavy ... but I really like it.  I thought I had found a lighter replacement with this hair dryer.  Unfortunately, I can't keep having my hair sucked into the back vent since it damages my hair, but usually needs to be cut to get the hair out.  This dryer would be great if that vent had some sort of cover to keep the hair out of the fan.", "It dries hair quickly but is quite heavy. It does have several levels of heat, including a non-heat blow dry setting. It seems to be well-made and I like the bright color of this hair dryer. My biggest complaint about it is its weight. It's too heavy to easily move around quickly and thus is sometimes pretty awkward.", "I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.", "This dryer has mulitple settings.  One switch to control the blast (a little or a lot) and one switch to control the temperture (low med high).  I have very curly hair, which I wear naturally.  I need my dryer to blast a lot of air, but at a very low temperture, and I need to have a diffuser.This fits the bill.  The only gripe I have is that I wish the diffuser were bigger. It's fairly small - you really have to dry your hair in fairly small sections.Recommend.", "This hairdryer has a lot of nice features.  It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser for straight hair and curly hair, respectively.  It has two speed settings as well as three heat settings.  I particularly like that it has three heat settings, as I prefer cooler air when I dry my hair.  I found that it dried my hair quicker than my old hair dryer and seemed a bit quieter as well.  I have long hair and had no problem with it getting stuck in the dryer.  My only minor quibble is that I wish you didn't have to hold down the cool shot button to use it.  But that is an extremely minor issue.  Overall, this is a great hairdryer and I am very impressed with it.", "Typical hair dryers are loud, not so with this Remington Silk Ceramic Dryer, and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof. He literally came running to get his head dried after his bath. So it's a pleasure for humans as well, with no piercing whine.This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I've found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference. This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.The only reason I didn't rank this dryer a 5 star, is because of the placement/design of the setting buttons. They are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on, and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying. However, for the drying performance, it's worth the occasional inconvenience.", "I like this hairdryer a lot. Even with the heaviness, which I associate with quality for some reason. It's a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I've had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron. The science has been lost on me.This comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but I don't normally use those.Overall a great dryer.", "Wife really likes this blow dryer.  It dries hair quicker thereby not exposing to harmful heat over longer periods of time.  She also noticed shinier hair.", "Okay overall I love the feel of the blow dryer in my hand, the handle is awesome.  I like the three speeds, the hot, warm and cool.  I like the cool burst.  I like the ion equalizer.  The diffuser works well.  The back pops off easily for cleaning.  My hair looked great when I was done.  One time when I had my hair flipped over and was blow drying upside down my hair got sucked into the back of the dryer through the vent.  I panicked since I was getting married in a week and my hair actually had to be cut off.  Sad thing is the hair got sucked in twice more.  Otherwise great dryer, just be wary of the rear vent.", "\"I have enjoyed this hair dryer overall.  I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  It also included two speeds.  I have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled.  As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.My hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly \"\"salon quality\"\".\"", "I am completely happy with this hair dryer, three heat settings, two speeds and cool burst, comes with straight and curly attachments and low noise level. I can't believe this is under $50 I have been looking for a replacement for my current dryer that super hot and noisy, I had replaced it less then a year ago with a small wall mount that was super loud and power button broke and I had to go back to my current.This hair dryer meets all my need and wants, love the cool burst, love the heat settings love the attachments. I can straighten my naturally wavy hair and curl it too, both look fantastic with minimal product. Only con is its a bit heavy, but I can handle that since it dries my shoulder length hair quickly.  Very pleased with this dryer.UpdateAfter almost of month of use I would say holding the hair dryer with the weight of the dryer resting against the top of your cupped fist around the handle, is the most comfortable way to use it. I am still very happy with the results.", "This is sleek looking hair dryer that fits right into the palm of your hand. The color is a nice burgandy/reddish color which I am fond of. It is much quieter than my old model and I found it very easy to operate. I used the diffuser on my wavy hair, used the high heat and ended with a cold shot of air. My hair turned out no different from any other hair dryer that I've used, but I loved that it is quieter! I will say that my hand switched the buttons over a couple times while I was using it, as they are located right where you grip, so that was slightly annoying. This also is smaller than my other hair dryers, but it is not super light weight.Overall if you are looking for a good everyday hair dryer or even a travel hair dryer, then I think this is a good choice. It has all the options found on many other models, is quiet and easy to use, plus gets the job done. I would consider a Remington again.", "I have naturally curly grey hair. For years I haven't bothered use a hair dryer, because it just promoted frizz. Even the ones I tried with a diffuser did not leave me with the smooth curly look I wanted. Of course, with naturally curly hair, getting what you want is rarely an option, you learn to like what you get for the day!I was admittedly more interested in how this Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer would work for my dog than how it would work for my own hair, and frankly didn't even intend to try it. But, I did try it, just on a whim. I figured that I had the day off and if my hair ended up a little more wild than usual, so be it. I was surprised to find that it did a nice job. I did use the diffuser.Today was bath day for my very furry, very beloved Duncan dog. So I did a lot of trimming and shaping as I always do pre-bath. I like to have some of the worst of the bushy hair trimmed up tight around his back end before I struggle with washing it. He isn't a fan of being brushed back there and it is just easier for us both. So I trimmed and tidied and clipped his hobbit-y hairy toes a bit and bathed him with his favorite shampoo and conditioner. (Okay, i picked it out, but he hasn't complained )My Duncan is an older fella and a rescue. WE put him at age 12-13 or so. He was found as a stray ten years ago, and we rescued him from a last chance sanctuary. One of the best decisions I ever made was to take the five hour trip to bring him home. He's glad, too and makes sure that I know it every day.After some brisk shaking, then towel drying I pulled out the nice quiet Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer, and popped on the diffuser. He was dry and comfortable in no time. The noise level matters for him, as loud noises make him uncomfortable. He looks beautiful, was not stressed out by the drying and is shiny and beautiful!So yes, we both approve heartily ! And we both recommend it!", "This hair dryer has the potential to be one awesome hair dryer - virtually perfect. There is one HUGE complaint that I personally cannot overlook, and if you have long hair, chances are you won't be able to overlook it either.There is no cap on the end where the air is sucked in. This means it constantly sucks your hair into the motor of the dryer! I actually had to cut my hair off of the dryer 3 times while using it. I then had to twist off the metal screen and try to get the caught hair out of there. The whole time I was drying my hair, it kept sucking it into the end and twisting it and yanking it out, as it gets caught in the fan in there. They need to add a cap for the end, no doubt about it.My hair is long, past the middle of my back and layered. It just kept getting sucked in and yanked repeatedly, every few minutes. I was blow drying my hair the same way I always do with my other hair dryer. I couldn't get the nozzle to my scalp to get at the roots for lift, because all the rest of the hair would get sucked in the back of the dryer. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would just be a few hairs and they would snap off but the times I had to actually cut the hair free, it was pretty thick sections and I could not pull it out/loose without ripping the lock of hair straight off my scalp. So I just cut it off as close to the dryer end as I could. Pretty disappointing.Otherwise, this is an amazingly great hair dryer. The shape/design is sleek and it is the perfect size. Not too big, and not too small. It has great power and is not too loud at all. Honestly, my hair looked and felt so good after using this dryer. I used the same styling products as always, so the only thing I can attribute this marvelous hair day to, is this hair dryer.I had so much more body and my curls looked better. My hair was soft and bouncy. Drying time seemed to be shorter, but I also have to admit that I would have dried it a few more minutes if it wouldn't have kept yanking my hair in. I just got fed up with that and was mad, so I stopped blow drying. I got it all but dry though and I know even up to that point was a shorter amount of time than it usually takes.It is really surprising to me that this hair dryer has such a design flaw. Remington dryers are usually good items. This one would be absolutely perfect if not for the end not having a cap. It has ample settings which all work great. The cold shot is great at the end to lock in style or cool down after all the heat of blow drying. It is comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy. Ii really love everything about it, except the missing cap at the end (darnit!!) The metal screen that is on the end has fairly large openings, so it can take in decent sized chunks of hair at a time - hence the need for scissors. It is totally flat, despite what the pic looks like here at amazon. The positioning of the dryer in the pic makes the dryer look rounded at the back as if it has a cap - but that is not the case at all. If you go to the walmart website and look up this dryer, they have a picture of the back end, as well as some other angles and you can zoom in also, so you can get a better idea of what I am talking about. I am also uploading a pic of my own here that you should be able to see up there with the product pictures.I was going to give this hair dryer 1 star, but I felt guilty because I really did love it otherwise, so I went with 3 stars. Sucking your hair in and ripping it off your head is just not acceptable and frankly, it's dangerous.Interestingly, my regular everyday hair dryer is also another Remington. For some reason, I cannot insert a product link, but it is an awesome dryer as well. It is Remington Shine Therapy and is a mint green color. So if you are looking for a great dryer, check that one out. The ASIN here at Amazon is B0015KGPUS - maybe it will pull up in a search. I was only able to find it here by doing a websearch first. It is currently out of stock, so maybe that's why it won't pull up and won't let me insert the link. I got my first one about 5 years, but after one too many falls off the counter, it finally broke and I bought another one of the same type a few months ago. I love it that much.So, in short, I absolutely love this hair dryer and I hate it too. I am going to look into finding something to use on the back end to avoid the problem and I am going to give Remington a call as well. Maybe they can recommend something. Maybe I can find one that fits off of another hair dryer. I would be a happy camper if that is the case!I should add that if your hair is not longer than chin length, you probably won't have a problem. But if it is longer than that, you will have the same issue as I did.", "This blow dryer is very powerful.  I thought it would be very nosy because I've never had a home hair dryer that wasn't; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn't run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it's as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.The coolest part is that it's red.", "I really liked this blow dryer. I was able to straighten my granddaughters hair with the concentrator. Also I love that she can dry her usually curly hair without it frizzing using the diffuser. I have had blow dryers with Ion technology before but they did not compare to this one. Also the size and weight of this dryer make it is easy to handle and use with no problem. The combination of settings makes any style possible. It gets very hot but can still shoot a burst of cool hair at the push of a button. It Is  definitely salon quality. The only down sides to this dryer is the hang loop is smaller than others that I have had and it blows with such force that you have to be carefully not to get your hair to close to the back of the dryer. It sucked  a piece of mine into it and it was painful.", "\"I have a Revlon hairdryer that is about the same price as this one but it is super noisy so I was curious if this would be quieter. It is. I am thankful.The hot air nozzle is small allowing all the air to concentrate on particular places on your hair but it also has an attachment for airflow concentration that reduces the area even more. I love the airflow diffuser and use it all the time. It allows me to amp up the speed and heat to their highest settings and maintain control of styling. When I'm about done, I press the cool shot so the motor can cool down before I shut it off. I think it might help preserve the life of a dryer.I like the removable filter too because lint always collects over time and I can clean it out so the airflow remains clear.The hang up hook is a handy thing for putting away quickly.I'm not so sure about the \"\"silk\"\" part but for the money this is a great dryer.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05891675874590874, 0.0632704421877861, 0.060310643166303635, 0.06147335469722748, 0.04852316901087761, 0.05806615203619003, 0.046502240002155304, 0.06372065842151642, 0.0631030797958374, 0.055538538843393326, 0.060962822288274765, 0.05835624784231186, 0.05261189118027687, 0.05988079309463501, 0.05584143102169037, 0.06766895949840546, 0.06525280326604843]]}
