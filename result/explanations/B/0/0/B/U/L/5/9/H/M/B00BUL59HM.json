I am not a fan of the new style of wearing bigger headphones, I still prefer ear buds even though these sound better. The microphone works just as well, though honestly I was surprised to see that these were marketed to go with cell phones. I don't mind using these with my laptop at home or work, but I wouldn't want to walk around with them listening to my mp3 player or talking on my phone. But that is just my preference, though not sure I have seen anyone using these kind of headphones outside of their office. But they work great and that is the most important part.", "\"This is a funny little item. It is essentially an old-school, corded, cell phone headset gussied up as DJ \"\"cans\"\". I suppose they are intended for people who use their phone like an IPod so they can take incoming calls while listening to music. Not sure why anyone else would bother. You can get much better noise cancelling ear buds if you are after good sonics and a little bluetooth over the ear headset is much more comfortable and less bulky for phone calls.The Pros: I used this with my Blackberry Torch and the sound from incoming calls was very good. The microphone also does a very good job with your speaking voice. They are relatively comfortable.The Cons: I tried these with my IPod and listened to a Tom Petty song and a Grateful Dead song and was underwhelemed by the sound quality, just okay. For comparison sake, I then listened to the same two songs with my Sennheiser CX 685 Adidas Sports In-Ear Headphones and the difference was night and day. The noise-cancelling ear buds cost twenty bucks more than this product and you can't talk into them but if music is important to you, this is not your go-to.I cannot reccommend this product. There are better options available.\"", "These are much better than wearing ear-buds.  They are light-weight, comfortable to wear, and I like the overall design.  The sound quality for voice is very good.  (I use different headsets for music.)For those who are interested, they are compatible with iPhone, Palm, Blackberry, HTC, Motorola, LG, Nokia, Samsung.  The adaptor for Nokia is included with it.Definitely recommended.", "I really like these headphones from Panasonic. They deliver an awesome sound that you just cant find with ear buds and other in-ear listening devices... However after wearing them for a while (30 minutes) they can become uncomfortable. The thin rubber/cushioning on the ear piece is flimsy and moves around causing irritation. The headset itself is  mostly built out of plastic.The relay on the headphones works perfectly allowing you to turn up/ down the volume or even pause a song/ podcast. I used it with my Iphone and didn't have any problems with it at all other than the irritation caused by the flimsy rubber cover on the ear pieces. This is a great set of headphones for the price.", "These are a solid set of quality headphone for the price point. A little large and bulky and a tad heavy. The weight means they aren't the best choice for working out. They are fine for sitting on the bike or similar, but not workouts requiring lots of movement. The sound quality is good and the tension isn't so much as to cause me a headache.", "Comparing with my Sony headphones I noticed some distortion with the Panasonic. Base tones were also noticably different and you could still here outside noise to some extent. Volume control (inline) is sensitive. Will give it 3 stars for durabilty, otherwise I would say 2 starts.", "The Panasonic Street Style Headphones for use with cell phones is great!  They come in a variety of colors, but no matter what color you choose, the sound is great.  I particularly enjoy them better than the ear buds because the ear buds always pop out of my ear and also is not always comfortable.  The Panasonic Headphones have that retro look, but they are very light weight, stylish, and comfortable on the head and ears.  There is also a mouthpiece attached for easy use if a phone call comes in while you are listening to music...seamless transition.  The black has a more masculine look, but won't get dirty if you have using at the gym or outdoors jogging, etc.", "I got 2 of these and overall I am satisfied.  I want to rate them at 3 stars but at the end of the day its 50$ headphones and as such not bad.  I did a 3d test on youtube with them and it was fantastic, however the bass test really sucked.  They really need to work on the bass.  Also another thing i didnt like was theres hardly any noise cancellation but again these are 50$ headphones.  All in all I am satisfied", "These headphones are of relatively light weight.  The entire structure appear to be all made of plastic.  The pads go over the ears.  The spring is light enough that it is realtively comfortable to wear.  It does not do much of a job of insulating you from the ambient noise but that can be a good thing if you wish to be aware of what is going on in the room you are in.  The sound is fine but not great.  The bass is a bit short and not so rich as the better headphones would give you.  At his price range of around $50, it is a good set but again not great.  The comfort aspect is probably a good enough reason to have them."], "Gamma": [0.3240428864955902, 0.3379785418510437, 0.3379785418510437], "Beta": [[0.2166474610567093, 0.018651777878403664, 0.015130024403333664, 0.1689082235097885, 0.11188721656799316, 0.05291472002863884, 0.19195136427879333, 0.002013512421399355, 0.22189569473266602], [0.21630778908729553, 0.018654681742191315, 0.014846952632069588, 0.16920864582061768, 0.11328918486833572, 0.05252845212817192, 0.1915794163942337, 0.0019395186100155115, 0.22164537012577057], [0.21630778908729553, 0.018654681742191315, 0.014846952632069588, 0.16920864582061768, 0.11328918486833572, 0.05252845212817192, 0.1915794163942337, 0.0019395186100155115, 0.22164537012577057]]}
